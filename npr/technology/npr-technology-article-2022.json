In a mixed verdict, a California jury found her guilty of four counts of fraud and found her not guilty on four other counts. We're joined now by NPR's Bobby Allyn, who has been covering the trial. He joins us from outside the courthouse there in San Jose. Hey, Bobby. BOBBY ALLYN, BYLINE: Hey, Mary Louise. KELLY: So take us through today's verdict by the jury. ALLYN: Sure. So like you said, a mixed verdict here. And just to remind listeners, Elizabeth Holmes was charged with defrauding investors of hundreds of millions of dollars and defrauding patients who got some of the blood tests with her former startup, Theranos. And the jury found beyond a reasonable doubt that she did indeed defraud investors. But when it came to the patients, some of whom took the stand and said they got faulty results when they went to a Walgreens and got a blood test, that there just wasn't enough evidence to convict her of defrauding the patients. But in terms of investors, they sent a very loud signal that yes, we, the jury, believe that Elizabeth Holmes is guilty of wire fraud. KELLY: How did Holmes and her team react to the verdict? ALLYN: She sat with a mask on at the counsel table between her two lawyers and didn't really have much of a reaction. You know, eventually, she got up and she grew a little bit more emotional and hugged members of her family that were sitting in the front row of the courtroom. But, you know, I've covered a lot of trials, Mary Louise, and this one struck me for just how silent it was when the verdict was read and in the aftermath. It was really eerily quiet in the courtroom. KELLY: And just to briefly remind people who may be thinking, hang on, weren't there 11 charges? She was found guilty on four, not guilty on the four other felony charges, and then on three remaining charges, what happened? ALLYN: Yeah, the jury could not decide. So that's the big question now. What happens to those three fraud-related charges that the jury just could not reach a unanimous verdict on? The judge said he is not going to rule on them right now. There's likely going to be motions on both sides. I imagine that the defense will file a motion asking that a mistrial be declared. The prosecution might have a counter to that. But in sum, you know, this is still a conviction. For sentencing purposes, whether she was convicted of one of these fraud counts or all 11, she still could face up to 20 years behind bars because of the way federal sentencing works in this particular case. So it still could mean some hefty prison time for Elizabeth Holmes when her sentencing date is finally set. KELLY: Got it. Just remind us how big a deal this has been in Silicon Valley. Everyone - I've been reading - it sounds like everyone's just been riveted watching this. ALLYN: Yeah, it's really rare for a startup CEO to be charged with fraud. I mean, every day, you're hearing about a new billionaire being minted on some new innovation promising to disrupt an entrenched industry. And that's what Elizabeth Holmes was trying to do, right? She promised that with just a tiny pinprick of blood, she could scan for hundreds of diseases and empower patients unlike they've ever been empowered before to take control of their health care. Well, turns out, those exaggerations were built largely on a house of cards. And over the course of four months, the government put on 29 witnesses that made a persuasive case to the jury. So now Holmes, you know, once a star in Silicon Valley is facing serious federal prison time. KELLY: NPR's Bobby Allyn reporting from outside that courthouse in San Jose, Calif. , bringing us the news Elizabeth Holmes convicted today of committing fraud on four counts. Thank you, Bobby.

The jury has been deliberating for seven days in the high-profile trial of the former Silicon Valley executive. NPR's Bobby Allyn has been covering the trial. He joins us now from outside the courthouse in San Jose. Hey there, Bobby. BOBBY ALLYN, BYLINE: Hey. How are you doing? KELLY: I'm all right. So what does this mean? The jury's deadlocked on some but not all of the charges. ALLYN: Yeah. So it means after seven days of hashing this out, there's still a lot of debate about whether Elizabeth Holmes broke the law. And look. This is a pretty technical case, right? She's facing 11 charges - nine wire fraud, two charges of conspiracy to commit wire fraud. And trying to get, you know, 12 people to agree beyond a reasonable doubt that she did or did not break these laws is just a complex process. I mean, this was a four-month trial, so there's a mountain of evidence. And the jury heard from more than 30 witnesses, including from Holmes herself. KELLY: And how's it work? Can they continue deliberating on the other charges? ALLYN: Yes. So the judge read what's known as an Allen charge, which refers to an instruction to basically encourage the jurors to keep deliberating on the counts that they cannot all decide. So, you know, it could be an hour. It could be days. What we know, though, is that the jury likely has reached a decision on most of the charges, so they probably have a verdict in hand on 8 of the 11 charges. But the remaining three - there's just too much debate. They can't figure it out. KELLY: Do we know, just by the way, which charges they're deadlocked on? ALLYN: We don't. No. KELLY: OK. All right. So just walk me through again how we got here, what kind of evidence this jury has been listening to over these last four months. ALLYN: Yeah. The government called former Theranos employees who blew the whistle after they said they saw the company covering up some of its shortcomings from Theranos investors who say they were duped out of millions of dollars and from patients who said they were given false results when they took blood tests from Theranos. But the main event, Mary Louise, was when Holmes took the witness stand herself, right? And she said, look. I was a big dreamer. I wanted to revolutionize the health care industry, and sometimes that means making some exaggerations. But, you know, she said, these big promises that she was making - she always thought that they would come true, right? And Holmes also pointed the finger at lab directors, who she said were more in touch, you know, with the technology than she was. And most controversially, she pointed the finger at her ex-boyfriend and deputy at Theranos, this guy named Sunny Balwani, saying she was sexually and emotionally abused during the time of the alleged crimes. KELLY: Quite how big a deal, Bobby, is this trial in Silicon Valley? How closely watched is it? ALLYN: Extremely closely watched. And that's because Theranos was once the hottest startup in the valley - right? - valued at $9 billion at its height. That's bigger than Uber or Spotify at the time, right? She was on the cover of magazines. She was on Ted Talks. Everyone saw Elizabeth Holmes' face and heard from her, right? So it's a spectacular fall from grace. But also, Mary Louise, you know, the trial's really raised questions about the culture out here that maybe enables some of these kinds of exaggerations that startup founders often make. I mean, she was reaching beyond her grasp - right? - with Theranos in saying what it can possibly do. But some people are saying, is that just the culture - you know, the fake-it-till-you-make-it culture out here? Or does this mean, you know, something more than that?

It's been called the Great Deplatforming. In the year since, far-right groups have scrambled to find new homes on the internet, and NPR tech correspondent Shannon Bond looks at where they have gone. SHANNON BOND, BYLINE: January 6 was a turning point for the Big Tech platforms and for many of those who used them to spread lies about the election, stoke conspiracy theories and call for violence. Jared Holt studies online extremism at the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab. JARED HOLT: Deplatforming kind of produced this great scattering, where groups that were banned or groups that believed their bans were imminent or forthcoming kind of engaged in this giant game of musical chairs. BOND: They turned to encrypted messaging on Telegram, YouTube alternatives DLive and Rumble and social media sites like Parler, Gab and GETTR that claim to allow users to post things that would get them in trouble on Facebook or Twitter. Some right-wing figures, like conspiracy theorist and pillow company CEO Mike Lindell, have even launched their own platforms. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MICHAEL LINDELL: They cancelled my Twitter. They cancelled YouTube. They cancelled Vimeo. I simply have to come up with something to give our voices back. BOND: On Lindell's streaming website, he's interviewed former-President Trump about his baseless claims of election fraud while promo codes for Lindell's pillow business appeared at the bottom of the screen. This scattering has had an impact, says Rebekah Tromble, director of the Institute for Data, Democracy and Politics at George Washington University. REBEKAH TROMBLE: It means that really prominent actors who helped stoke the stop the steal campaign that led to the insurrection have much less reach, get much less audience and attention. And that is very, very, very important. BOND: The alternative apps have become echo chambers for those clinging to the false belief the election was stolen. But none has broken out as the main destination for the far-right and diehard Trump supporters. Researcher Megan Squire at Elon University says it's become harder for these groups and influencers to gain mass followings. MEGAN SQUIRE: I would say it's going to be an uphill battle for most of these guys. They don't all have the ability to make their own platforms. And a lot of times, they lose their legitimacy being off of the mainstream ones. BOND: And of course there's the Trump factor. The former president has not joined any of these platforms. Instead, he's touting plans for his own social network which has yet to launch. Jared Holt says the far-right groups are adapting. HOLT: These smaller groups of extremists are, you know, showing up to lower level, you know, government institutions, like city councils or school boards, and participating in these kind of culture-war causes of the day. BOND: They're joining other groups in protests against vaccine and masking rules and over how public schools teach kids about race. This local focus doesn't require a big network to have an impact. HOLT: If the purpose of organizing is just to get a dozen people to turn out at a local government body, then, you know, they don't need a channel or a account with 100,000 followers on it, they might just need a hundred. BOND: That's made extremists less visible on the national stage, but not less of a threat, says Candace Rondeaux of the think tank New America. CANDACE RONDEAUX: You even have to really go almost to the county level to understand what's happening and how what happens online is related to what's happening offline.

And a lot of times, they lose their legitimacy being off of the mainstream ones. BOND: And of course there's the Trump factor. The former president has not joined any of these platforms. Instead, he's touting plans for his own social network which has yet to launch. Jared Holt says the far-right groups are adapting. HOLT: These smaller groups of extremists are, you know, showing up to lower level, you know, government institutions, like city councils or school boards, and participating in these kind of culture-war causes of the day. BOND: They're joining other groups in protests against vaccine and masking rules and over how public schools teach kids about race. This local focus doesn't require a big network to have an impact. HOLT: If the purpose of organizing is just to get a dozen people to turn out at a local government body, then, you know, they don't need a channel or a account with 100,000 followers on it, they might just need a hundred. BOND: That's made extremists less visible on the national stage, but not less of a threat, says Candace Rondeaux of the think tank New America. CANDACE RONDEAUX: You even have to really go almost to the county level to understand what's happening and how what happens online is related to what's happening offline. BOND: Putting together that picture will be the challenge for researchers, journalists and law enforcement in 2022. Shannon Bond, NPR News.

The annual trade show is one of the biggest tech events of the year, a time for companies and inventors to display their latest and greatest ideas. And while the pandemic and politics put a damper on this year's gathering - attendance was way down, and many of the big names stayed away for fear of blowback - we still thought it would be a good time to hear about the show and what it tells us about the future of tech. So we called John Hendel, a tech reporter at Politico who attended CES in real life, as they say. John Hendel, welcome. Thank you for joining us. JOHN HENDEL: Thank you. Good to be here. MARTIN: So first, what was it like to attend CES in person? As I mentioned, a lot of major companies decided to attend virtually this year. A lot of people did, too. So - but what was it like and how did that affect the feel of the conference? HENDEL: That was the really kind of surprising thing in my mind because I think I initially expected just kind of pure tumbleweeds and, you know, no one really there even. You know, that was the initial kind of fear that, like, no one would come when you saw every major company from T-Mobile to Facebook to Amazon, you know, kind of pulling back from this. But there were still hundreds of people just all around the trade show. I mean, I think about 40,000 attendees still came to this. MARTIN: Well, one of the points that you made in your post about it in writing about it with your colleague - because a lot of the big names stayed away, some of the smaller vendors got a chance to shine - right? - a little bit. So can you just tell us about one or two of the biggest trends that stood out to you from this week? HENDEL: You know, one bigger focus we saw this year generally was on health and wellness very much front and center at the trade show. And you had health care companies like Abbott speaking when you really hadn't had health care companies at CES before. You know, Abbott was on stage talking about their ways to test and, you know, how they've been able to help during the COVID-19 pandemic with rapid tests and how that technology might be used in other sort of testing. And you saw a lot of other vendors. There was one I remember on the trade show floor that talked about, you know, an AI personal trainer that you could have. And there were different wearables that would be tracking health data. Those new sectors like health, wellness, transportation, all of that was very much kind of at the forefront in a different sort of way. MARTIN: You mentioned that the decision by Amazon, Google, Microsoft, TikTok and others to sit out CES in person, we already talked about the fact that it kind of opened the door for other tech companies to flex their muscle, but you also said that the absence of these big tech companies who, you know, have drawn a lot of Washington's ire in recent months and years, you said it set a more harmonious tone. Do you think this conference tells us anything going forward about the relationship between Washington and tech companies, especially big tech, or was this just kind of a one-off given just the unique circumstances? HENDEL: You clearly saw, even among like some of the healthcare companies here, you know, they were making a point that even though there's a lot of consumer data used in some of their health, tech services, they are different from some of the social media services that would be using data. That's something that really seemed striking and will be instructive when Congress does write any laws that may deal with this, whether they're on data privacy or other parts of the kind of tech policy arena. And again, you had senators who did come in person, and they said it's very important to be talking to these companies. You know, I saw the chair of the Senate Commerce Committee Maria Cantwell and Senator Jackie Rosen and Senator Blackburn. I saw them walking along - among the exhibitors and really looking deep into that. So I think for them, you know, they say that's valuable. And so, yeah, I'm curious what's next and where we'll see that go.

This is prime time for returns of ill-fitting sweaters and regrettable sequin socks you might have bought on sale. NPR's Alina Selyukh explains what happens when you send them back. ALINA SELYUKH, BYLINE: I really hope this doesn't ruin any friendships because whoever gifted Marcus Shen a self-heating coffee mug for Christmas. . . MARCUS SHEN: Don't think that's something I need to have. SELYUKH: Oof (ph). It was a nice thought. SHEN: You can keep your coffee warm, I guess. It's like a - kind of an electric coffee mug. SELYUKH: And you're not a coffee drinker? Or you just. . . SHEN: Oh, no, I love coffee, but I usually drink it pretty quickly (laughter). SELYUKH: Returns are Shen's professional expertise. He's the chief operating officer at B-Stock, which helps big retailers resell their returns, often to smaller stores. SHEN: The categories that we see the most tend to be consumer electronics, certainly apparel. Home and garden and furniture seems to be a big category, too. SELYUKH: Because that is what we've been buying in the pandemic, and a lot of it online, which is between two and five times more likely to result in a return. And now last year's record spending is producing record returns. Here's Hitendra Chaturvedi, supply chain management professor of practice at Arizona State University. HITENDRA CHATURVEDI: As a matter of fact, we will be crossing half a trillion dollars' worth of products. SELYUKH: That's more than the economy of Israel or Austria sent back in returns for stuff we bought last year. You've probably contributed. I know I did. Just last week, when I sent back a blanket that turned out too small for my new couch - sorry, blanket. I asked Chaturvedi about its fate. Will someone else buy it? CHATURVEDI: Your blanket has a very high probability of being in a landfill. SELYUKH: Yikes. CHATURVEDI: That item is going to go to a warehouse where, if the blanket was lucky, somebody is going to inspect it to see if there is any damage to it. SELYUKH: He says a fairly small portion of returns gets put back on shelves. Like, if I hadn't opened my blanket, it might get its package sanitized and resold like nothing happened. With opened packages and especially for cheaper products, they're often not worth the cost of shipping back plus paying someone to look at it, clean it, repair, test, reseal. That's why big stores might tell shoppers, just keep whatever it is. We'll send you a new one. SHEN: The lower cost items - typically, it starts to get more and more relatively expensive to process from a return's perspective. SELYUKH: Shen's company B-Stock is one of many middlemen helping retailers offload their returns. Some go to discount and outlet stores. Some to sellers on eBay or other websites. Some get donated to charity or recycled. Many U. S. returns end up sailing overseas. Chaturvedi says that's the likeliest fate of my blanket. CHATURVEDI: And this blanket, along with other blankets and apparel, will be rolled up into a bale, just like you do a bale of hay. SELYUKH: Except it's a bunch of returned clothes and linens sold by weight to an overseas merchant who will try to sell or maybe donate it. And if not, they'll be trashed or burned. Resale company Optoro estimates U. S. returns create almost 6 billion pounds of landfill waste every year. CHATURVEDI: That is what consumers don't realize - the life of the return is a very, very sad path. SELYUKH: Of course, this grim forecast is a bit of a - well, blanket statement. Stores and products vary. For example, pricier clothes are very likely to get dry-cleaned and sold again as new. Electronics often get resold as almost new but in an open box. Shen says retailers are getting smarter about their returns. SHEN: Anecdotally, what we've heard, particularly with larger retailers, that a higher and higher percentage of that stuff is going direct to consumer, that they're trying to resell that. SELYUKH: Technology is slowly getting better at avoiding returns in the first place, helping you buy the right size sweater or picturing a new rug inside your room. And most importantly, more shoppers are getting comfortable with buying stuff that's not exactly brand new. SHEN: The idea of that is no longer creepy for us, right? SELYUKH: And I can only hope that his prediction is right - that both his electric coffee mug and my blanket will be back on the shelves to find a happy owner. Alina Selyukh, NPR News.

But the workers at the small independent video game company known as Vodeo hope to model something different by being the first unionized video game company in North America. NPR's Andrew Limbong spoke with some of the workers about charting a path for the rest of the industry. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ANDREW LIMBONG, BYLINE: In the video game Beast Breaker, you play as Skipper, a mouse who steals Granny's sword to quite literally bounce around and fight, you know, beasts. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LIMBONG: It's made by Vodeo, a relatively small and young game company. And unlike the reputation that precedes a lot of video game companies, it's actually a pretty chill place to work, says Carolyn Jong, a game designer there. CAROLYN JONG: Vodeo is a place where there's been a lot of emphasis on things like work-life balance, for example. We have a four-day work week. LIMBONG: There's also protections against harassments and guardrails against what's known in gaming as crunch, which is essentially working massive amounts of overtime right before a game's launch. JONG: These are kinds of things that we want to hold on to. LIMBONG: So the workers decided to form a union to get these protections down on paper. There's also the rest of the industry to think about. JONG: We want to also help set a precedent that helps normalize those kind of practices that we think are really important for workers and the entire industry. LIMBONG: To back up a bit, video game workplaces have been in the news lately. Riot Games, which makes the popular League Of Legends, just last month agreed to pay $100 million to settle a class action gender discrimination lawsuit. Before that, workers at Activision Blizzard, which makes Call Of Duty, staged a walkout to protest layoffs. And even that is coming off the heels of a separate Activision Blizzard walkout prompted by reports that the CEO didn't respond to years of sexual misconduct claims at the company. EMMA KINEMA: These things are all connected. They're all rippling back and forth, and people are learning lessons across all these different efforts. LIMBONG: That's Emma Kinema, senior campaign lead for Communications Workers of America's games and tech arm. She helped the Vodeo workers form their union, and she says the biggest obstacle to widespread organizing in games isn't scalability or logistics or anything like that. KINEMA: It's a question of ideology. It's a question of education. It's a question of culture. It's a question of the social kind of fabric of that industry being developed and matured to a level where the workers are ready to own, you know, their own rights and voice in the workplace. LIMBONG: She points to the decades-long process the film industry took to organize. That could be a template of sorts for what could happen in video games. And yeah, Vodeo is a small company, but Kinema says that they became the first successful certified union of video game workers in North America says something to workers at the bigger studios. KINEMA: It's no longer a hypothetical question of, would you support having a union in the workplace? It's actually, look, these people we know, these people who do the same job we do at a company just like us - they went and organized. LIMBONG: Back at Vodeo, lead artist Jemma Salume knows that people are watching them, and she hopes the company can be an example of success. But besides all the big-picture industry stuff, she's mostly looking out for her co-workers. JEMMA SALUME: Part of my personal motivation for unionizing was like, well, I want to take care of all these people. (Laughter) Like, I care about them. LIMBONG: She wouldn't tell me though if the next Vodeo game was going to have a little emblem on it that says union made. Andrew Limbong, NPR News.

That's thanks to advances in artificial intelligence, AI. In some cases, it's becoming hard to distinguish synthetic voices from real ones. Chloe Veltman of member station KQED recently got her voice cloned and brings us this story. CHLOE VELTMAN, BYLINE: The science behind making machines talk just like humans is very complex because our speech patterns are so nuanced. It's taken well over 200 years for synthetic voices to go from the first speaking machine invented by Wolfgang von Kempelen. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)AUTOMATED VOICE #1: Na, na, na, na (ph). VELTMAN: . . . To a Samuel L. Jackson voice clone delivering the weather reports on Alexa today. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)AUTOMATED VOICE #2: (Imitating Samuel L. Jackson) Tonight's forecast calls for showers with a low of 52 degrees. VELTMAN: So it's quite a shock to find out just how easy it is to order up a fake voice from a speech synthesis company like the one I worked with, San Francisco Bay Area-based Speech Morphing. For a basic conversational build, you record yourself saying a bunch of scripted lines into a mic for roughly an hour, and that's about it. Here, the explosion of mirth drowned him out. That's what Carnegie did. I'd like to be buried under the Yankee Stadium with JFK. DANIEL RADZINSKI: All right - no the before Yankee Stadium. VELTMAN: Speech Morphing general manager Daniel Radzinski listens in remotely as I say hundreds of phrases from the script he sent me in advance. I'd like to be buried under Yankee Stadium with JFK. The lines aren't as random as they seem. Radzinski says he chooses utterances that will produce a wide enough variety of sounds across a range of emotions to feed a neural network-based AI training system. It essentially teaches itself the specific patterns of a person's speech. RADZINSKI: It will come out in the right prosody, if you will. VELTMAN: After we're done, I sent him the recordings. From there, the Speech Morphing team breaks down and analyzes my utterances and then builds the model for the AI to learn from. It all takes less than a week. Speech Morphing founder and CEO Fathy Yassa says the possibilities for the Chloe Veltman voice clone - or Chloney, as I've affectionately come to call my robot self - are almost limitless. FATHY YASSA: So we can make you apologetic. We can make you promotional. We can make you like acting in a theater. We can make you sing eventually - not yet there. VELTMAN: The global speech and voice recognition industry is worth tens of billions of dollars and is growing fast. Its uses are evident. The technology has given actor Val Kilmer, who lost his voice owing to throat cancer. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)VAL KILMER: My voice as I knew it was taken away from me. VELTMAN: . . . The chance to reclaim something approaching his former vocal powers. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)KILMER: But now I can express myself again. VELTMAN: It's enabled film directors and game designers to develop characters without the need to have live voice talents on hand, like in the movie \"Roadrunner,\" where an AI was trained on Anthony Bourdain's extensive archive of media appearances to create a digital double of the late chef and TV personality's voice. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"ROADRUNNER\")AUTOMATED VOICE #3: (Imitating Anthony Bourdain) You're probably going to find out about it anyway, so here's a little preemptive truth telling. There's no happy ending. VELTMAN: As pitch-perfect as this might be, it's been controversial. Some people raised ethical concerns about putting words into Bourdain's mouth that he never actually said while he was alive. A cloned version of Barack Obama's voice warning people about the dangers of fake news hammers the point home. Sometimes we have cause to be wary of machines that sound too much like us. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)AUTOMATED VOICE #4: (Imitating Barack Obama) We're entering an era in which our enemies can make it look like anyone is saying anything at any point in time even if they would never say those things. VELTMAN: And sometimes we don't even want machines to sound too human because it creeps us out. User experience and voice designer Amy Jimenez Marquez led the Amazon Alexa personality experience design team for four years. She says if you want a digital assistant to do children's story time, a more human-sounding voice might be great, as that's more approachable. AMY JIMENEZ MARQUEZ: Maybe not something that actually breathes because that's a little bit creepy but, you know, a little more human. VELTMAN: But for a machine that performs basic tasks like, say, a voice-activated refrigerator, maybe less human is the way to go. JIMENEZ MARQUEZ: So having something a little more robotic. And you can even create, like, a tinny voice that sounds like an actual robot that's cute. That would be more appropriate for a refrigerator. AUTOMATED VOICE #5: (Imitating Chloe Veltman) Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday, dear Chloney. Happy birthday to you. VELTMAN: No, this isn't a talking fridge. Allow me to introduce Chloney, my digital voice double. Chloney may not be able to sing \"Happy Birthday\" yet, but she can read out news stories I didn't even report myself, like this one ripped from an AP newswire. AUTOMATED VOICE #5: (Imitating Chloe Veltman) September wasn't exactly the robust month for hiring that many had expected and hoped for. VELTMAN: She can even do it in Spanish. AUTOMATED VOICE #5: (Imitating Chloe Veltman, speaking Spanish). VELTMAN: Chloney sounds a lot like me. Let's hope she doesn't put me out of a job anytime soon. For NPR News, I'm Chloe Veltman.

Airlines say the signals could interfere with critical navigation equipment on some aircraft and would have a catastrophic impact on their industry. But the wireless providers will roll out 5G service elsewhere after midnight tonight. NPR's transportation correspondent David Schaper is here. Hey there. DAVID SCHAPER, BYLINE: Hey, Mary Louise. KELLY: So I got to say I've been looking forward to 5G service - better quality streaming, speed up my phone. What, from an aviation perspective, is exactly the problem with it? SCHAPER: Well, in order to get that amazing step-up in mobile phone service, the telecom companies needed more bandwidth. And they purchased a big chunk of it in the C band. And the problem is where the C band spectrum is located. It's right next to the frequencies used by radio altimeters on airplanes and helicopters. Those are a navigational tool that tells pilots exactly how far above the land or terrain below them they are. It's a critical piece of safety equipment used by pilots when landing and flying in bad weather, when visibility is poor. And the concern here is that the 5G transmissions from cell phone towers will interfere with some of the older radio altimeters on some planes. And that's led the FAA to raise some red flags over safety. KELLY: OK, so they've raised red flags. Can the FAA do more than that? I mean, they can't just ban 5G. SCHAPER: Well, no, they can't. And the FAA oversees aviation safety. It's the FCC that governs the airwaves. The FCC agreed to auction off this section of spectrum to AT&T and Verizon for close to $80 billion back in 2020. And the FCC says its engineers believes 5G can safely coexist next to the aviation frequency without causing any problems. But the FAA just isn't so sure. And with the launch of 5G service looming, the FAA did the only thing that it could do, which is restrict flying of certain aircraft that might have this radio interference problem at certain airports, especially in bad weather. So both the passenger and cargo airlines said, hey; that would force us to cancel or divert or delay potentially hundreds of flights a day, affecting tens of thousands of passengers. The airlines' CEOs warned that the nation's commerce might grind to a halt as a result. KELLY: Well, it sounds like Verizon and AT&T are listening. They have agreed to adjust their plans to address some of these concerns. What's going to happen? SCHAPER: Well, they're still going to roll out 5G as planned almost everywhere, as you said at the top. And while they insist their 5G signals will not interfere with the aircraft radio altimeters, that there is enough distance between the two bands of spectrum, they say they have voluntarily agreed to not turn on certain 5G towers around certain airports and runways or, in the case of Verizon, limit our 5G network around airports. They want to limit the possibility of interference. It's just not clear yet how many towers and which airports will be totally affected. This is the third time these companies have done this - delayed 5G rollout. But I did speak with former FAA administrator Michael Huerta about what's next. MICHAEL HUERTA: What really needs to happen is a very detailed tech analysis, airport by airport and aircraft type by aircraft type, to determine how real this interference potential actually is. SCHAPER: And that's work that these telecommunications companies say should have already been done by now. And they insist, again, that this will be safe. They blame the airlines and the FAA for not addressing these issues sooner. KELLY: NPR's David Schaper. Thanks, David. SCHAPER: Thanks so much, Mary Louise.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE: (Singing) Soon may the Wellerman come to bring us sugar and tea and rum. ELLIOTT: Exactly a year ago, social media was obsessed with these kinds of videos of people performing old maritime folk songs. It took about a week for the trend to burn out. NPR's Neda Ulaby tells us what such so-called garbage trends have to do with you. NEDA ULABY, BYLINE: You know something's reached a kind of cultural tipping point when it gets on NPR. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)SCOTT SIMON: Argh. The latest trend in pandemic distraction may be - shiver me timbers - sea shanties. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: (Singing) There once was a ship that put to sea, and the name. . . REBECCA JENNINGS: It was, like, a whole craze for, like, a week, and then no one remembered it ever again. ULABY: Rebecca Jennings covers internet culture for Vox. She's seen so many short-lived trends come and go, she's come up with an expression for them. JENNINGS: Garbage trends. They kind of are like fast fashion. They sort of come out of nowhere, and then the next week, they're in a landfill - like, the figurative landfill of ideas. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)HALLIE CAIN: OK, TikTok, I have a new word for you. ULABY: Take, for example, this internet slang. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)CAIN: The word, my friends is cheugy (ph), OK? It's the opposite of trendy. ULABY: The word cheugy or a recipe for baked pasta that captivated hungry TikTokers last year. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MACKENZIE SMITH: Add cherry tomatoes, olive oil and salt to a baking dish and toss. Put a block of feta in the middle. ULABY: Look, fads and trends are nothing new - tulip mania in the 1600s, the Charleston dance craze of the 1920s. When you look at clips of Josephine Baker dancing the Charleston back then, they could almost be TikTok videos today. But there's one huge difference, says Rebecca Jennings.

JENNINGS: But you don't really know what actually is meaningful or valuable about them. ULABY: There's something, she says, about the rise of garbage trends that reflects how we've all been dealing with the pandemic over the past two years. JENNINGS: Things have just felt so frenzied. You know, the vaccine and everything's fine, or it's like, oh, wait, no delta's here. No, everything's not fine. And, oh, omicron - and, like, oh, what are we supposed to do? ULABY: The garbage trend, as trivial as it may be, can root you in the moment when the future feels uncertain. The garbage trend is not a trend, Jennings says.

(SOUNDBITE OF KARTELL'S \"SILVER SCREEN\") DEBBIE ELLIOTT, HOST:   Do you remember when sea shanties briefly took over the internet? (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE: (Singing) Soon may the Wellerman come to bring us sugar and tea and rum. ELLIOTT: Exactly a year ago, social media was obsessed with these kinds of videos of people performing old maritime folk songs. It took about a week for the trend to burn out. NPR's Neda Ulaby tells us what such so-called garbage trends have to do with you. NEDA ULABY, BYLINE: You know something's reached a kind of cultural tipping point when it gets on NPR. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST) SCOTT SIMON: Argh. The latest trend in pandemic distraction may be - shiver me timbers - sea shanties. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: (Singing) There once was a ship that put to sea, and the name. . . REBECCA JENNINGS: It was, like, a whole craze for, like, a week, and then no one remembered it ever again. ULABY: Rebecca Jennings covers internet culture for Vox. She's seen so many short-lived trends come and go, she's come up with an expression for them. JENNINGS: Garbage trends. They kind of are like fast fashion. They sort of come out of nowhere, and then the next week, they're in a landfill - like, the figurative landfill of ideas. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) HALLIE CAIN: OK, TikTok, I have a new word for you. ULABY: Take, for example, this internet slang. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CAIN: The word, my friends is cheugy (ph), OK? It's the opposite of trendy. ULABY: The word cheugy or a recipe for baked pasta that captivated hungry TikTokers last year. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MACKENZIE SMITH: Add cherry tomatoes, olive oil and salt to a baking dish and toss. Put a block of feta in the middle. ULABY: Look, fads and trends are nothing new - tulip mania in the 1600s, the Charleston dance craze of the 1920s. When you look at clips of Josephine Baker dancing the Charleston back then, they could almost be TikTok videos today. But there's one huge difference, says Rebecca Jennings.

As NPR tech correspondent Shannon Bond reports, while platforms such as Facebook and Twitter face intense scrutiny for their role in spreading harmful health hoaxes, podcasts can be even more influential sources of information. SHANNON BOND, BYLINE: It wasn't the first time Joe Rogan or his guests have floated dubious or outright false information about the pandemic. But for Dr. Katrine Wallace, Rogan's last podcast episode of 2021 was the last straw. KATRINE WALLACE: This particular episode of the Joe Rogan podcast was sent to me hundreds of times the day that it went live by my followers because their friends and family were sending it to them as evidence that the vaccines are dangerous and that they shouldn't get it. BOND: Wallace is an epidemiologist at the University of Illinois Chicago and part of a community of experts who debunk medical misinformation on social media. In the episode in question, Rogan interviewed Dr. Robert Malone, a scientist who worked on early research into the technology behind the top COVID vaccines in the U. S. , but who's now a vaccine skeptic. Malone made a lot of baseless and disproven claims, like saying that getting vaccinated puts people who have already had COVID at higher risk. It all alarmed Wallace. WALLACE: It provides a sense of false balance, like there's two sides to the scientific evidence when really there is not. The overwhelming evidence is that the vaccines are safe and that they're effective. BOND: She's particularly worried because Rogan has such a big audience. A stand-up comedian and TV personality, Rogan has an exclusive licensing deal with Spotify, reportedly worth $100 million. So Wallace joined a group of fellow health professionals in an open letter, slamming the company for allowing its biggest star to broadcast misinformation. WALLACE: We are in a global health emergency, and streaming platforms like Spotify that provide content to the public have a responsibility not to add to the problem that we have right now. BOND: They're not asking Spotify to kick off Rogan, but they want the company to be more transparent about its rules and to make it easier to flag these kinds of baseless claims about COVID. Spotify declined to comment for this story but has previously said it bans content about COVID that it deems dangerous or false. It's taken down 20,000 podcast episodes for breaking that policy, but Rogan's Malone interview is still available. Spotify CEO Daniel Ek told Dan Primack of Axios last year that the company does not take responsibility for what Rogan or his guests say. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)DANIEL EK: Joe Rogan is just one out of eight million creators that we have on the platform. DAN PRIMACK: But the best paid of all of those. EK: Sure. But we have a lot of really well-paid rappers on Spotify, too, that make tens of millions of dollars, if not more, each year from Spotify, and we don't dictate what they're putting in their songs, either. BOND: Rogan did not respond to NPR's requests for comment. Misinformation researchers say it was only a matter of time until the spotlight turned to podcasts. EVELYN DOUEK: Wherever you have users generating content, you're going to have all of the same content moderation issues and controversies that you have in any other space. BOND: Evelyn Douek is a research fellow at Columbia's Knight First Amendment Institute. She says it's much harder to ferret out things like falsehoods and hate speech in podcasts, compared to posts on Facebook and Twitter. But audio can be a powerful way to spread misinformation, says Valerie Wirtschafter at the Brookings Institution. VALERIE WIRTSCHAFTER: The podcaster is in your ear. You're probably alone, listening to this podcast. It's a really unique relationship in that respect. The podcaster gains a level of authority and a level of credibility among listeners. BOND: Wirtschafter has been studying how the big lie - that the 2020 election was stolen - spread on political podcasts before the January 6 assault on the U. S. Capitol. WIRTSCHAFTER: We're not talking about fringe ideas. These are the most popular podcasts in the United States.

S. airlines and the nation's wireless carriers came to a short-term agreement this week to slow or limit the rollout of the new 5G wireless spectrum near some airports. That averted a mass cancellation of flights for now. But safety is still a concern. Airlines and the FAA are worried about how 5G can interfere with flight navigation, specifically with altitude measurements. We're joined now by Captain Dennis Tajer of the Allied Pilots Association. They represent some 15,000 pilots who fly for American Airlines. Captain Tajer, thanks for being with us. DENNIS TAJER: It's great to be with you. Thank you. SIMON: Do you feel safe? Are you reassured with the solution so far? TAJER: Well, we don't fly unless it's safe. No matter what the FAA says, our companies or manufacturers, if it's not safe, it's our job to be the last line of defense for our passengers. The good news is, is that is - the drama that fueled this, the pressure cooker, the false one that I believe was generated by the cell phone companies on this was unnecessary. We do have a much better path now. We have procedures now. They've tested some things at airports. We have what they call AMOC, alternative means of compliance. I have a downloaded 737, which I'm captain on. And it looks like I'm not going to have to go through this arduous checklist in most of the cases when I fly. SIMON: Captain Tajer, I just do not understand why, let's say, Japan and France have successfully rolled out 5G and contended with this issue and the U. S. has not. TAJER: Cellphone companies, of course, lauded the fact this has been going on in so many different countries. Well, it going on differently. For instance, in France, they had the antennas pointed downward. They brought the power of the signal down, and they backed away the frequency from the frequency that my aircraft uses for this critical input through the radio altimeter. And that protected the airplane in France for almost two minutes prior to landing, whereas in the U. S. , what the cellphone companies have proposed would have given me about 20 seconds of protection and with some rapid deployment on that. So we like where we are, but we're going to keep watching. SIMON: Well, why would there be a rush? TAJER: Well, that's because they decided, hey, on this date, this is going to happen. The bottom line is this was a commercial interest deadline. The cell phone signal was not here to save the troops, fight terrorism. It's a commercial interest. We are very interested in having that there because companies grow based on better product. But when you start to nibble in on a margin of safety, then we're not looking at commercial interest anymore. SIMON: I mean, what happens if you're coming in for an approach at O'Hare or LAX and the system they have in place now doesn't work? TAJER: They've kind of - they've done a fulsome study on this. I know it was quick, but they were able to do it. And we're going to trust the engineers, trust the science. So now, that interference shouldn't happen. And if it does, it's going to be much more rare. But coming into an approach - and not even just the approach, but clear-and-a-million as we say, clear skies, if the radio altimeter gets bad information, it's feeding up to 17 different systems - engines, terrain avoidance, collision avoidance, speed brakes - these are flight controls, all the things I use for landing and flying. So it's a lot - a bit like the 737 Max. Bad information in can cause bad things to happen down the line. And that's why the FAA was so concerned - Boeing, Airbus, our airlines and the pilot unions. But thank goodness we're past that. We still have our guard up. We're still in the ring fighting for safety. We just now have some space between us and the opponent.

ELISSA NADWORNY, BYLINE: In addition to going digital, the new SAT will shrink from three hours to two, include shorter reading passages and allows students to use a calculator on the math section.

The streaming service has taken all of Neil Young's music off its platform, and they did so because the singer asked them to. Young made this request as a protest against the COVID-19 misinformation and false claims that Joe Rogan has been spreading on his hugely popular Spotify podcast. We should note Spotify is one of the funders of NPR, and our programs are available on the streaming service, but we cover it like any other company. We are joined now by NPR culture correspondent Anastasia Tsioulcas. Hi, Anastasia. ANASTASIA TSIOULCAS, BYLINE: Hey. Good morning, Rachel. MARTIN: So this is a little bit of a saga. Tell us how it started. TSIOULCAS: Yeah. Just on Monday, Young briefly posted an open letter on his own website, addressed his management and his record label. And he asked them to remove his music from Spotify as a protest against Joe Rogan, who has been widely criticized for spreading misinformation about coronavirus vaccines. MARTIN: Right. And then Neil Young took his open letter down? TSIOULCAS: Yes, very quickly, but it was up long enough to get his message out there.

His songs have been streamed hundreds of millions of times on Spotify, and now he is certainly one of the most significant musical artists who doesn't appear on the service. MARTIN: Is he setting a possible precedent here? I mean, does it look like any other musicians are going to follow? TSIOULCAS: Well, no one else of that stature certainly has pulled their material as of now. After all, Spotify is the most popular audio streaming service in the world.

And not every artist or creator is willing to go to the lengths that Neil Young is in terms of putting their money where their mouths are. MARTIN: Yeah. TSIOULCAS: In a statement posted on his own website last night, Neil Young said that 60% of his streaming came via Spotify, so that's a pretty big number. MARTIN: Has Spotify responded to this? TSIOULCAS: Yes. A company spokesperson sent us a statement yesterday that said in full, quote, \"we want all the world's music and audio content to be available to Spotify users. With that comes great responsibility in balancing both safety for listeners and freedom for creators.

But an on-the-ground invasion isn't Russia's only option. President Putin could launch an all-out cyberattack that could disrupt the entire world. To understand just how devastating cyberattacks can be, you actually need to go back a few years to the summer of 2017. And here's NPR's cybersecurity correspondent, Jenna McLaughlin. JENNA MCLAUGHLIN, BYLINE: Matthew Olney remembers the day he found out about a catastrophic cyberattack in Ukraine that shut off, well, everything. MATTHEW OLNEY: I was at Starbucks, and my phone rang. I was waiting in line. It was, you know, our partner on the ground in Ukraine. And basically, the first words out of his mouth was essentially everything is off. Nothing is working. MCLAUGHLIN: Russian military hackers had attacked energy firms, banks and government agencies in Ukraine through a popular tax filing software program pretending to be criminals. But their goal was to cause destruction. Olney's team of threat intelligence researchers at the tech company Cisco were working with Ukrainian authorities to track malicious hackers. While Ukraine was the intended target, the nasty code got out and spread to companies around the globe, costing them billions of dollars. OLNEY: So the attack clearly wasn't just at the infrastructure of Ukraine, but it was at the very ability of Ukraine to deal economically with the world. MCLAUGHLIN: Ukraine has been a punching bag for Russian cyberattacks for years, but things have heated up lately as Russian President Vladimir Putin has sent large numbers of troops and equipment to the border. Everyone's on edge. VIKTOR ZHORA: We understand all the risks connected to potential cyberattacks that can happen in the near future. MCLAUGHLIN: Viktor Zhora is a senior cybersecurity official in Ukraine. ZHORA: And our task is to be ready to this, understand all the risk, and be prepared to resist. MCLAUGHLIN: Zhora is leading an investigation into a recent breach. Likely Russian hackers defaced dozens of government websites and destroyed several computers at government agencies. The websites are back up, and the damage has been contained. But Zhora says the intelligence gleaned from the attack could be valuable, particularly when it comes to critical infrastructure in the energy sector. ZHORA: Ukraine has a long history of being a target for cyberattacks and particular in energy sector, like it happened in 2015 and 2016 with attacks on the power grids. And now we use this experience and new technologies and awareness to provide resilience. MCLAUGHLIN: He says Ukraine has new cybersecurity requirements for key public facilities. The state department has people on the ground helping build technical capacity for one. But it's a big challenge. Vulnerable, pirated software is still extremely popular in Ukraine, and it's very difficult to keep Russian hackers out. Remember that NotPetya attack? It's not just a nightmare Ukrainians are hoping to stop from repeating. It's also a cautionary tale for the rest of the world. VISHAAL HARIPRASAD: It really reminds the industry of 2017 and the NotPetya attacks. And, you know, that's - that was the last major cyberevent before the ransomware epidemic that really hit home for a lot of folks. So it's top of mind for many insurers. MCLAUGHLIN: That's Vishaal Hariprasad. He goes by V8, and he's the CEO of Resilience Insurance. He says the industry is bracing for the possibility that the escalating situation in Eastern Europe might not stay contained there. But, like in Ukraine, he hopes the lessons of the past have sunk in. During NotPetya, hackers exploited vulnerabilities that had patches available. And companies that had kept their software up to date were protected. HARIPRASAD: So what we've been sharing with a lot of insurers is, don't worry too much about who's pulling the trigger necessarily. From an enterprise perspective, if you're going to get caught in this crossfire, do your best to patch, to make sure that you've addressed the right vulnerabilities. MCLAUGHLIN: And as an additional layer of protection, the U. S. government has put out some advisories specifically about Russian hackers' favorite tools and tricks. Plus, DHS's cyberagency CISA says companies should be wary of digital traffic coming from Ukraine amidst the ongoing crisis. Jenna McLaughlin, NPR News, Washington.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"STUCK IN THE MIDDLE\")COLON: (Singing) You know what she said to me? She said, you're a player, aren't you? I hope you know that it shows. VENKAT: He put it up on TikTok under that name - Tai Verdes. At the time, he was working at a Verizon store. COLON: I saw other people like me that had no following end up on the radio. And when you see that happen multiple times because of one app, it's kind of like a duh, you know what I'm saying? Like, why not? (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"STUCK IN THE MIDDLE\")COLON: (Singing) 'Cause we're stuck in the middle of lovers and friends, and we're losing every part of the benefits. VENKAT: Before he knew it, he was fielding calls from presidents of record labels during his lunch break. He got a record deal, made a debut album and is going on tour this year. \"Stuck In The Middle\" has been streamed well over 100 million times on Spotify. Verdes says he thinks he would have made it even without TikTok, but he also noticed that his fans on the app were especially engaged. They'd go from his TikTok to his Spotify page or his YouTube channel. COLON: You just made this video. You have this song. You have this melody that they really like. They want to go get that. You just gave them something. TATIANA CIRISANO: They're not just listening to music in a sort of, like, lean-back, passive way. But they're more likely to do more lean-forward activities, like creating playlists or listening to full albums on streaming or buying merchandise. VENKAT: Tatiana Cirisano is a music industry analyst. She says consumer behavior data shows that TikTok users are more likely to spend money on music. What's more, TikTok users often respond to music with their own videos. They might lip-sync a song, make up a dance or try to sing it. CIRISANO: It's changed music listening from being a one-way relationship where a song comes out and you listen to it on your own, to something that you participate in. I mean, I don't think that any other social media app has done that to this degree. TikTok is like peak UGC in that way. VENKAT: UGC - short for user-generated content - it's one of the buzzwords currently going around in the music industry. NINA WEBB: When I first started, it used to be a puzzle for a 3-year-old. You had video and radio. VENKAT: That's Nina Webb. She's the head of marketing at Atlantic Records. WEBB: And you just - you needed money and leverage and influence as a label. And now I feel like it's the thousand-piece gray sky where TikTok is the only piece that will individually move the dial the way it does. VENKAT: Last August, an Atlantic Records artist named Gayle released a song called \"Abcdefu. \"(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"ABCDEFU\")GAYLE: (Singing) Forget you and your mom and your sister and your job and your broke-down car and the things you call art. VENKAT: They promoted the song on TikTok a lot, but it didn't really take off until months later when the sign language sub-community of TikTok got a hold of it in the middle of her tour. WEBB: She saw the difference from playing at the beginning of the tour, when people, like, somewhat kind of heard this or looked it up, to by the end - I mean, it was like the whole place was going crazy. So November was really the tipping point, and it was 100% the sign language community. VENKAT: That user-generated content made all the difference for Gayle. Her song has been sitting at No. 1 on the Billboard Global 200 chart for three weeks now. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"ABCDEFU\")GAYLE: (Singing) A-B-C-D-E forget you and your mom and your sister and your job and your broke-down car and the things you call art. VENKAT: These days, there's a cottage industry dedicated to marketing a song or artist on TikTok - paying influencers to promote a song, posting short clips to see what people respond to, trying to get a dance challenge going. Webb says she's certainly tried different strategies, but most times when a song takes off on TikTok, it seems to happen organically. WEBB: I mean, there's a million examples of a lot of very expensive campaigns that had no return. Like, we can't do it. It has to come from fans or the artist because you're talking to Gen Z. They smell everything out. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"IT'S ALL COMING BACK TO ME NOW\")CELINE DION: (Singing) There were nights of endless pleasure. It was more than any laws allow. Baby, baby, if I kiss you like this. . . VENKAT: Sometimes those fans work in unexpected ways. Celine Dion's \"It's All Coming Back To Me Now\" came out 25 years ago but recently set one-day streaming records on Spotify and YouTube after lip-syncing the most dramatic part of the song became a viral TikTok trend. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"SNOWMAN\")SIA: (Singing) Don't cry, snowman. . . VENKAT: Or take the song \"Snowman\" by Sia. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"SNOWMAN\")SIA: (Singing) Who'll catch your tears if you can't catch me, darling. VENKAT: That came out in 2017, but the TikTok challenge came in 2020. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: I'm going to try to see if I could do this one breath. (Singing) I want you to know that I'm never leaving 'cause. . . UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: (Singing) . . . I'm Mrs. Snow, till death we'll be freezing. Yeah. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: (Singing) You are my home, my home for all seasons. So. . . UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: (Singing) . . . Come on. Let's go. VENKAT: Analyst Tatiana Cirisano says the ability for a song to go this viral is baked into TikTok since the whole app prioritizes discovery. CIRISANO: When you open TikTok, even if you've never used the app before and aren't following anyone, it opens immediately to a discovery page and just starts feeding you content. Like, you open it, and you're on the train. VENKAT: She says the music industry used to hunt for unknown talent and develop it. But the rise of TikTok has helped to flip that formula. CIRISANO: I think that we are increasingly in an era where audiences are choosing what they want to hear, and record labels and the rest of the music industry are sort of listening to that. VENKAT: Independent artists have taken notice. DAMOYEE: Hi. My name is Damoyee. I am 21. I'm originally from Dallas, Texas, and I am a multi-hyphenate music artist/content creator. VENKAT: Damoyee is a composer, producer, singer, songwriter, and she plays a lot of instruments. DAMOYEE: I'm primarily a piano player first. I started around age 2. I picked up a guitar, electric and acoustic. I can play ukulele, dulcimer. . . VENKAT: She posts a lot of covers and remixes of other songs, usually trending songs. And it's a lot of work. A minute-long TikTok usually takes around six hours to create. (SOUNDBITE OF TIKTOK)DAMOYEE: (Singing) I could do this for hours and hours and hours. I could do this for. . . I know starting out, it took me a little less than a week to get 100 followers. And I remember, like, seeing one-zero-zero, I freaked out. I thought, hey, I'm famous, you know? (Laughter) I was grateful. VENKAT: Sometimes a video flops, and sometimes it takes off. But Damoyee says that she generally feels TikTok helps boost musicians like her. DAMOYEE: I will say for now, the goal is to thrive as an independent artist without looking at any labels at the moment and to still build a platform to the point where I would feel comfortable releasing music alone. VENKAT: In other words, she's hoping that eventually she won't have to ask the traditional powers in the music industry for recognition. Thanks to TikTok and other platforms, they may recognize her first. Mia Venkat, NPR News. (SOUNDBITE OF SIA SONG, \"SNOWMAN\") TAMARA KEITH, HOST:   The artist Doja Cat has a hit song called \"Say So,\" with its own signature dance. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"SAY SO\") DOJA CAT: (Singing) Day to night to morning, keep with me in the moment. KEITH: She didn't invent the dance. That was a teenager on TikTok named Haley Sharpe. It went viral. Doja Cat noticed, put it in her music video and then performed it at the Grammy Awards. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"SAY SO\") DOJA CAT: (Singing) You want it, say so. KEITH: Perhaps you don't use TikTok or don't use it to discover music. But as Doja Cat proves, the music industry certainly does. NPR's Mia Venkat explains. MIA VENKAT, BYLINE: Tyler Colon played college basketball. He won an MTV reality show. He's tried podcasting, modeling, acting. But in 2019, he got serious about pursuing music. TYLER COLON: After singing in my car for, like, six months for an hour and a half every single day, I released \"Stuck In The Middle\" under Tai Verdes. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"STUCK IN THE MIDDLE\") COLON: (Singing) You know what she said to me? She said, you're a player, aren't you? I hope you know that it shows. VENKAT: He put it up on TikTok under that name - Tai Verdes. At the time, he was working at a Verizon store. COLON: I saw other people like me that had no following end up on the radio. And when you see that happen multiple times because of one app, it's kind of like a duh, you know what I'm saying? Like, why not? (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"STUCK IN THE MIDDLE\") COLON: (Singing) 'Cause we're stuck in the middle of lovers and friends, and we're losing every part of the benefits. VENKAT: Before he knew it, he was fielding calls from presidents of record labels during his lunch break. He got a record deal, made a debut album and is going on tour this year. \"Stuck In The Middle\" has been streamed well over 100 million times on Spotify. Verdes says he thinks he would have made it even without TikTok, but he also noticed that his fans on the app were especially engaged. They'd go from his TikTok to his Spotify page or his YouTube channel. COLON: You just made this video. You have this song. You have this melody that they really like. They want to go get that. You just gave them something. TATIANA CIRISANO: They're not just listening to music in a sort of, like, lean-back, passive way.

I'm Manoush Zomorodi. Today on the show, the first part of our series Work, Play, Rest. And so far, we've been hearing about ways to make work better for workers, for cities, for entrepreneurs. But right now, with millions of people having given up their jobs in the past year, some companies are struggling to fill their ranks, and so they're turning to machines. KEVIN ROOSE: Companies have been investing in automation to fill the gap in their labor force, saying, instead of paying people $15 or $20 an hour for entry-level work, what if we spent $100,000 and built a machine that could do this job forever? ZOMORODI: This is Kevin Roose. He's a tech reporter for The New York Times. And he says the pandemic is only speeding up the inevitable automation of many jobs. ROOSE: Right. ZOMORODI: Like, I saw that Domino's Pizza is putting in place equipment to produce their dough and people just saying, well, we were going to make the transition. Let's do it now because we actually don't have enough humans to do the jobs. Is that a strange knock-on effect of this employment crisis? ROOSE: Yeah. There are a lot of economists who think that this sort of acceleration that we've seen during the pandemic could really pull forward by a number of years this looming automation crisis. ZOMORODI: Let's be clear. Robots taking over jobs is not really a new problem. ROOSE: In the first sort of wave of automation during the 20th century and early in this century, automation and machines were mostly doing manual labor. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: Today's way of manufacturing. ROOSE: They were doing repetitive tasks in factories. They were, you know, sorting packages in warehouses, things like that. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: Automatic packaging of our products. ROOSE: And now, you know, there are still people who are performing jobs that are essentially end points. You know, they're taking instructions from a machine, and they're plugging them into another machine. Basically, the goal is to automate these tasks entirely. Those jobs are the first that are going to be automated. ZOMORODI: We've known about that kind of automation for a while, but machines are also coming for other sectors, even professional, higher-paid jobs. ROOSE: Now with AI and machine learning, machines can do what we would think of as cognitive work, even complex cognitive work. There was a study a few years ago, and they found that actually, the jobs that were most at risk of being automated were white-collar jobs, jobs that require college education. Some of them require graduate degrees. Managers, supervisors, things like market research analyst or sales manager, personal financial advisor - those were the jobs that, actually, AI is now doing quite well. ZOMORODI: Nearly a decade ago, automation even came for Kevin's job. And it kind of freaked him out. ROOSE: One of my first jobs in journalism involved doing a lot of corporate earnings reports - the kind of basic, you know, Toyota made this much money this quarter with strong sales in their North American division, or something like that. ZOMORODI: Right. ROOSE: And now that job has been almost completely automated. Most publications and, like, the AP and Reuters now use automated software to write corporate earnings reports. And so that was my first hint that something was happening in this industry, in journalism, and that I needed to start paying attention to it because the last thing I wanted to do is to wake up one day and find that I had been replaced by a robot. ZOMORODI: I remember the first time that we heard about these automated journalism and reports going on. And I read one, and I was like, oh, it's pretty good (laughter), actually. I mean, you know, you start to think, well, what am I adding to this work, right? It starts to beg a very fundamental existential question when you see that AI or whatever you want to call it can automate your job pretty well. It starts to make you think, well, why am I needed? ROOSE: Absolutely. I mean, this is happening not just in journalism but in every industry - in medicine, in law, in finance. And so now the question for us is, what can we do that machines can't? Where is our distinct human advantage? And so that's what I set out to learn. I started off by going to every expert I could find, and I basically asked them, like, what can we do to avoid being replaced by a robot? And what they told me was basically, no, there is no job that is completely protected from robot replacement, from automation, from AI. But any job can be made more resistant to automation by essentially making it more human. ZOMORODI: Kevin Roose picks up the idea in his TED talk. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)ROOSE: Rather than trying to compete with machines, we should be trying to improve our human skills, the kinds of things that only people can do, things involving compassion and critical thinking and moral courage. And when we do our jobs, we should be trying to do them as humanely as possible. For me, that meant putting more of myself in my work. I stopped writing formulaic corporate earnings stories, and I started writing things that revealed more of my personality. I started a financial poetry series. I wrote profiles of quirky and interesting people on Wall Street, like the barber who cuts people's hair at Goldman Sachs. I even convinced my editor to let me live like a billionaire for a day, wearing a $30,000 watch and driving around in a Rolls-Royce - tough job, but someone's got to do it. And I found this new, human approach to my job made me feel much more optimistic about my own future because you can teach a robot to summarize the news or to write a headline that's going to get a lot of clicks, but you can't automate making someone laugh with a dumb limerick about the bond market or explaining what a collateralized debt obligation is to them without making them fall asleep. ZOMORODI: OK, so for journalism, I mean, it makes sense, right? We live now in a world where journalists have brand names. Their byline is sometimes more important than the name of the publication. But how can that human-centered approach be applied to other jobs? ROOSE: Yeah, I think that a lot of these more resilient jobs will be the ones that involve providing emotional support for people. You know, home health care workers, occupational therapists, nurses, teachers, career coaches - these kinds of jobs that, you know, even if a robot could technically give you advice on, you know, how to talk to your boss about a raise, you're going to want a human with experience and some real, you know, bedside manner to walk you through that. You're not going to accept a robot substitute. ZOMORODI: To me, that was proven so much through the pandemic with my kids' education, how much they needed the support of a teacher who saw the look in their eyes when they didn't understand something. You know, as much as there is available online with Khan Academy and other ways that you can learn remotely, that relationship in and of itself is an education. And I feel like my kids really missed it. ROOSE: Absolutely. I think one of the lessons that we learned during the pandemic is that there are limits to the amount of automation and technology that we will accept into our lives. There are certain things that humans are just better at. So those jobs - they're not totally immune. No job is immune. But those jobs are much, much safer than jobs that don't involve meeting people's emotional needs. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)ROOSE: As I researched more, I found so many more examples of people who had succeeded this way, by refusing to compete with machines and instead making themselves more human. Take Marcus Books. Marcus Books is a small, independent, Black-owned bookstore in my hometown of Oakland, Calif. It's a pretty amazing place. It's the oldest Black-owned bookstore in America. And for 60 years, it's been introducing Oaklanders to the work of people like Toni Morrison, Maya Angelou. But the most amazing thing about Marcus Books is that it's still here. So many independent bookstores have gone out of business in the last few decades because of Amazon or the internet. So how did Marcus Books do it? Well, it's not 'cause they have the lowest prices or the slickest e-commerce setup or the most optimized supply chain. It's because Marcus Books is so much more than a bookstore. It's a community gathering place where generations of Oaklanders have gone to learn and grow. It's a safe place where Black customers know that they're not going to be followed around or patted down by a security guard. As Blanche Richardson, one of the owners of Marcus Books, told me, it just has good vibes. Marcus Books temporarily closed. And like a lot of businesses, its future was uncertain. It was raising money through a GoFundMe page. And if you look at the comments on its GoFundMe page, you can see why Marcus Books has survived all these years. One person wrote that we have a duty to preserve gems like this in our community. Someone else said, I've been going to Marcus Books since I was a child, and Blanche Richardson showed me many kindnesses. Those aren't words about technology. They're not even words about books. They're words about people. The thing that saved Marcus Books was how they made their customers feel - an experience, not a transaction. ZOMORODI: I wonder if somebody listening is like, well, Marcus Books clearly isn't scalable. But I guess what you're saying is, like, that's the point. ROOSE: Right. And a lot of the sort of businesses that we're seeing today are successful because they're not scalable. And that's a signal because what people are paying a premium for in those businesses is the handmade quality of these goods, the fact that they're not being churned out in a warehouse in China somewhere. So I think that the economy that we're seeing is sort of fracturing into two. There are the things that are done by machines. There are the things that are done by humans. And I think both of those are worthy of exploration. ZOMORODI: OK, so let's talk about how we actually build this sort of next era of the workforce because what you're talking about is a different kind of training. I think it's about emphasizing emotional intelligence. How do you even teach that? - because what worries me is that some people who maybe are introverted or shy or, you know, a good journalist but maybe not quite as charming as you, Kevin - that they somehow get left behind in this emotionally centric workforce. ROOSE: Yeah. I mean, it's going to take some work for some people. The way that during the Industrial Revolution people had to retrain themselves to work in factories rather than on farms, for this new AI era, we're going to learn - need to learn these more fundamental human skills. There are social and emotional learning programs. There are, you know, courses you can take to improve your empathy. In medical schools now, there are classes that are purely about how to talk to patients. They're not about, you know, how to diagnose them. It's about how do you break bad news to people? How do you empathize with someone who's going through one of the hardest times of their lives? And that's the kind of education and skills that we're going to need across lots of disciplines. One of the fastest-growing, you know, jobs in the tech industry right now is basically trust and safety. It's people who can manage the health of these enormous platforms to prevent people from misusing them. And that's something that requires a lot of complex understanding of, you know, human dynamics and human nature and, you know, understanding threat models. And that's a skill that they're not teaching in a lot of college computer science classes but that has turned out to be hugely important. ZOMORODI: I mean, no matter how much we need humans to do certain work, it sounds like, in the future, there will simply be fewer jobs, period. Is that something we need to hear governments address more? - because right now politicians still seem to run on a platform of, you know, bringing work back to a region, saying, we will train for new jobs. But perhaps what we really need is more of a paradigm shift. ROOSE: I think we do. I mean, I think we should take a lesson from some of the other countries that have implemented structures and systems to help people through times of technological change. In Japan, for example, there's a longstanding practice among factories where, if your job is automated, they can basically loan you out to another company that needs your skill set until they find something else for you to do. It's a practice called shukko, and it's been going on for decades. In Sweden, there are these job councils that basically catch people who are laid off because of automation. And they pay for - there's these sort of public-private partnerships, and they pay to retrain people, to teach them interview skills, to get them out onto the job market again, to basically serve as a kind of safety net for people when their jobs are displaced by automation. And then, of course, the most basic thing we could do to help people through this time of transition is to provide things like universal health care, which, you know, would prevent a lot of people from feeling like, if they lose their job, they also lose their access to health care. And we'd kind of decouple these things that we need to survive with the jobs that make us money. ZOMORODI: But, Kevin, maybe we even need to pay people if they don't work, right? Some people have been talking much more seriously - and it's actually being tested in certain places - this idea of a universal basic income. Is that what the future holds? ROOSE: Yeah. I think that - you know, I support universal basic income. But I do think we will need a broader safety net not only because there will be fewer jobs but because it's going to take some time for people to make the transition from one set of jobs to another. I think that this often gets lost when you hear people, you know, at big, fancy conferences saying, oh, there will be, you know, new jobs created to replace the old ones that disappear to AI. And it's like, well, yeah, but that's not going to be a seamless process. It never has been. ZOMORODI: Right. ROOSE: You know, during the Industrial Revolution, there was, you know, lots of dislocation. There were, you know, labor riots and horrible working conditions and many years where wages were not catching up to corporate profits. And it took a lot of real effort and activism to make that work for workers. And so I think that we need to be conscious of the fact that some people are not just going to seamlessly leave their, you know, automated job and go become, you know, metaverse therapists or whatever the new jobs will be. They will need skills they will need to be taught. So we actually want to differentiate ourselves, to leave our own distinct mark on the things that we create so that people on the other end - people who are, you know, listening to podcasts - know that we are humans doing this conversation and not robots, you know, feeding each other laugh lines. ZOMORODI: (Laughter). That's Kevin Roose. He's a technology columnist for The New York Times and the author of \"Future Proof: Nine Rules For Humans In The Age Of Automation\". You can see his full talk at ted. com. Thank you so much for listening to our episode about work today. We couldn't, of course, get into all the ways that people are rethinking their jobs and how they make a living, but I hope the broader themes of this show brought you some context. Maybe it even gave you a different perspective on any dissatisfaction with work that you're seeing or experiencing yourself. Some old ideas, like collective bargaining - they are coming back. Other old ideas, like who gets to access high-paying jobs, are being toppled. But perhaps most reassuringly - to me, at least - there are signs that, in the future, we'll put a higher value on humanity, the work that only humans can do, even in an economy increasingly run by algorithms and machines. A quick reminder - this was the first show in Work, Play, Rest, our series about how the fundamental ways we spend our time are changing, which means that next week, we explore play with musician Jacob Collier and many others.

Our partners at TED are Chris Anderson, Colin Helms, Anna Phelan, Michelle Quint, Sammy Case and Daniella Balarezo. I'm Manoush Zomorodi, and you've been listening to the TED Radio Hour from NPR. MANOUSH ZOMORODI, HOST:   It's the TED Radio Hour from NPR. I'm Manoush Zomorodi. Today on the show, the first part of our series Work, Play, Rest. And so far, we've been hearing about ways to make work better for workers, for cities, for entrepreneurs. But right now, with millions of people having given up their jobs in the past year, some companies are struggling to fill their ranks, and so they're turning to machines. KEVIN ROOSE: Companies have been investing in automation to fill the gap in their labor force, saying, instead of paying people $15 or $20 an hour for entry-level work, what if we spent $100,000 and built a machine that could do this job forever? ZOMORODI: This is Kevin Roose. He's a tech reporter for The New York Times. And he says the pandemic is only speeding up the inevitable automation of many jobs. ROOSE: Right. ZOMORODI: Like, I saw that Domino's Pizza is putting in place equipment to produce their dough and people just saying, well, we were going to make the transition. Let's do it now because we actually don't have enough humans to do the jobs. Is that a strange knock-on effect of this employment crisis? ROOSE: Yeah.

Like so many booming industries, tech has completely changed some of our cities, creating hubs and uplifting certain places while leaving others behind. IRMA OLGUIN: You know, you think about California. You think about palm trees and beaches and Hollywood and the Bay Bridge. And that's not where I grew up (laughter). That's not at all where I grew up. ZOMORODI: This is Irma Olguin. And her hometown isn't exactly known for innovation. OLGUIN: Yeah, Fresno is a place that you drive through to get to somewhere else. ZOMORODI: If you do drive through Fresno, you'll see a very different kind of industry. OLGUIN: You see miles and miles of ag land, which could look really different depending on the season. If something is in season, it's going to be green, and you might see the irrigation dripping. If it's not in season, you might see, you know, entire orchards being ripped out, piles of trees and wood waiting to be burned. If you are in raisin land, which is where my family spent its time, part of the process is that these giant sheets of paper are laid out in the dirt. You pick the grapes, and they are left to bake in the sun. It's like this really thick, almost sweet dusty smell that smells like home. It's really hard to put words to it. ZOMORODI: How long have you and your family lived in Fresno? OLGUIN: So my grandparents migrated from South Texas and from Mexico to California, following the crops, following the work. And they became field laborers right there in the Central Valley. My life is different from, say, my parents, who - all of their formative years were spent in the fields. And I did not realize necessarily that we were poor. Everybody that I knew at that time had a similar story to mine - immigrant parents or grandparents, farm labor being the story, never enough money, always trading, you know, rent for your electricity bill or your electricity bill for groceries, or - you know, it was always that. And so you've got folks who have started with very little trying to make their way - claw their way to something else. And the stress of that and the sort of community around never having enough didn't feel abnormal to me. That was the truth and reality. It wasn't until much later that I realized that not everybody struggled in that way. ZOMORODI: Yeah. And you actually got the opportunity to leave Fresno and go to college. I mean, that must have been quite a culture shock. OLGUIN: Yeah. So I ended up with a scholarship offer across the country, in Ohio. And arriving there, it was just like, I shouldn't be here. I don't know any of the things that you guys know. I'm so far behind. You know, when I got my email address for the college, it was my very first email address ever. And they had to show me what that meant, like, what email was. And so, yeah, you just feel in so many ways like this is for other people. ZOMORODI: (Laughter) I mean, that's kind of crazy because you ended up getting a degree in computer science. OLGUIN: That's right. I was very young in a place that I didn't know, understand or recognize. And I really wanted to take classes in the most beautiful building on campus. And for me, that was a glass building. It turned out to be the College of Engineering. And somebody said that that's where computer science took place, and there were computers, you know, scattered all over that building. So it was. . . (LAUGHTER)OLGUIN: . . . It was serendipitous that I ended up being able to choose a major that I would never have seen for myself. ZOMORODI: And how did it go? OLGUIN: Well, getting a computer science degree was a slog. It was. . . (LAUGHTER)ZOMORODI: No, not easy. OLGUIN: I won't say that it came easily to me. But it did feel pretty obvious over time that a person could muscle their way through this industry. I think there's, like, this mystery that surrounds the technology industry, which makes people believe that it's super hard and super for other people. But spending time in it, I got to see kind of how the sausage was made. And it was like, oh, there's a lot of different types of jobs inside of this industry and a lot of different places for folks even like myself. ZOMORODI: When you say even like yourself - meaning that you didn't have a Ph. D. or that you were Latinx or - how do you mean? OLGUIN: So there were a number of things where it felt like that phrase, even for me, comes in. First of all, I'm a woman. I am Latina. I was a queer young person in a time when being a queer young person was still really, really loud and, in many rooms, unwelcome. And so, yeah, there was a lot of even-for-me feeling. But more importantly, I felt like I didn't have to be a genius to be in the industry. I could be just me. I could put my shoulder into it and be tenacious and do the same thing I'd done all of my life, which was, you know, fight to survive. And I could find my place in this industry. ZOMORODI: Irma Olguin picks up her story from the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)OLGUIN: Something miraculous happened. I got a job in tech. And I remember the first time I didn't have to count the change when trying to figure out how much to tip for pizza delivery, when I realized that this industry, the technology industry, was going to change my life forever. And I remember thinking to myself, if it can happen to me, a poor, queer, brown woman from nowhere, why can't it happen to entire cities of people like me? ZOMORODI: So to find out the answer to your question, instead of going to Silicon Valley or New York, you decided to go back to Fresno. OLGUIN: I did. It seemed like the only thing where I would sort of be able to live up to what the world gave me. So, yeah, it was a pretty simple decision. Go home, and figure out how to bring this back. All of these lessons - how do you give them away? (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)OLGUIN: And so for the last eight years, that's what I've been working on in Fresno - building a business that could expose what it takes to cause an entire city, and not just a select few people in it, to thrive. ZOMORODI: Fast-forward a bit. You founded a company called Bitwise Industries. Can you just describe in a nutshell what you do? OLGUIN: Yeah, certainly. So Bitwise - we build tech economies in underestimated cities, which is sort of fancy for, we ignite the technology industry in places where you don't expect to find it and invite people to that new economy that don't expect to be there. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)OLGUIN: So the cornerstone of everything that we do is job training. The communities that we work with are often from very poor populations, maybe folks who are learning English as a second language. Maybe they were unhoused, the formerly incarcerated, veterans, folks who are very often from retail or factory work. These folks - their issue is not their ability to learn technical things. Their problems center on things that are a lot less obvious, things like child care, transportation, hunger, money. So those are the things that we focus on. A person's ability to break into the technology industry has nothing to do with their ability to learn JavaScript or whether they were good at math in the fifth grade. What is a factor is creating room in that person's life to see if they're good at JavaScript or if they can be good at math. And to create room in a person's life, you really have to attack the things that stand in the way of that time. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)OLGUIN: How do you justify learning to do something like write code when there are bills to pay? Wouldn't it be better for the family if you just got a job at McDonald's and put in as many hours as you can because that's a check? And who's going to watch your little brother? That's what we do as a family. We pitch in. But how do you justify to the people around you when it looks to them like you're just playing around on the computer? We didn't invent a new way to teach JavaScript. We just focus a lot more on the things that actually prevent people from learning it. In addition to connecting our students to things like bus tokens and free regional transit options, we also just deploy a fleet of vehicles whose only job is to pick these folks up before their study groups and drop them back off after class. If they need food, we get them food. We work with food cupboards and pantries and making sure that boxes of food are delivered to these students' homes with enough for a family of three to five people. We connect them to child care options that make sense for their schedules and their budgets. But most importantly, because cash is such a center of energy and decision-making for these families, through our apprenticeship program, we literally pay them to learn. So not only do they get to earn a wage and are exposed to real-world work, but now they also have that first line on the resume, the one that's so hard to get and the one that builds confidence in the rest of the world that you might know what you're talking about. ZOMORODI: You know, it's interesting. You describe Bitwise as providing a technology education. But what you're really kind of doing is igniting an industry, a tech economy from the bottom up. OLGUIN: Yeah. Once you remove those as the problems, now you've got access to a wide population of folks who have never been invited to this segment of the economy, who could take advantage of the jobs that exist in that economy and change the reality for the generations that come after them. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)OLGUIN: And so you might be thinking to yourself, OK, Irma, this sounds great, but it sounds really expensive. So how do you pay for it? We've turned a long-held idea on its head. We have to stop putting the burden, the financial burden on the student and the families who are already struggling and start putting it on the people and the entities that benefit most from their untapped potential - entities like governments, corporations, philanthropy. These are the entities that benefit from the development of that talent, and so that's who we get to pay for it. The U. S. spends a trillion dollars scaling up a workforce for this country. We apply for allocations of that same kind of money and use it to pay people to learn. We also work with corporations. We can train up entire cohorts or a generation of junior-level and apprentice-level technologists trained directly to their systems, ready to be hired on Day 1. We've worked with all kinds of companies, getting them to pay for things like tuition and money for students to accomplish exactly this goal. We've worked with over 5,000 students. And of those entering our career programs, over 80% earn technical employment. And in Fresno, this means that that new technology workforce is greater than 50% female or gender nonconforming, greater than 50% minority or Latinx and 20% first generation. And those demographics mirror the demographics of our county. These are folks leaving restaurant, retail, factory and field labor earning on average less than $20,000 a year, exiting the programs earning 60 to $80,000 a year. And we can do this, you know? It's not at all a mystery. It's worked in Fresno. It's working in Bakersfield and Toledo, Ohio. And it can work in underestimated cities all over the world. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ZOMORODI: So you've been doing this for eight, nine years now. And have you started to see the city change as a result? And you mentioned other cities. What is happening in terms of not just the people in the program, but the places where they live? They're not leaving, I guess. OLGUIN: No. No. It's one of the best parts of what we do. And by doing this specific work in underestimated cities, 90% of the folks that we train stay at home. That's where they want to be. They're not looking to leave. We talk about the lift from, you know, earning $21,000 a year to, in three years, 80-plus thousand dollars a year. But that is really just one ingredient in a person being able to participate in their community. And when people participate in their community, you see home ownership changing. You see reliable cars being driven. You see new businesses springing up. You see better support of local businesses that already exist. And you see people voting differently and leadership changing over time in that place. ZOMORODI: But we know what happens, Irma, when tech comes into a city and makes the cost of living that much higher. It keeps out the people from whom you came. The families - are you worried that other families won't be able to afford to stay if you are - could you be a victim of your own success? OLGUIN: I think if we forget who we are, we absolutely could be. But what we definitely don't want to do is create an unworkable situation for the next generation. I think the topic itself is, of course, complicated. There's a housing shortage across the nation. There's a lot more units that need to get built. So yeah, of course, we're asking ourselves that question - is, you know, can or should Bitwise participate in that? Or is there another way to attack the problem so that we're not perpetuating the issue of sort of gentrification? It's the last thing we want to do. But we're built for and by the community of a place. And we deeply, deeply believe that people who know and understand real problems can solve real problems. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ZOMORODI: It's all awesome, Irma. But, I mean, I have to ask - a lot of these jobs are entry level. And it makes me worried because when you look at job trends, you know, the next 10, 15, 20 years, these are the jobs that will likely get automated. Is it just a continual process that these people will need to be reskilled over and over again? Or, you know, I guess, what is the potential for some of these jobs? OLGUIN: Well, the potential is pretty extraordinary. So I think that with the technology industry, we think about it. And I think a lot of times, you think about, oh, it's, you know, Google and Facebook. And it's Big Tech. But the truth is that just about all companies are becoming technology companies or technology-enabled companies. And that includes the school district. That includes the local hospital. That includes the, you know, county office of education and the nonprofit down the street, and Joe's Logistics on the corner. And all of those being powered by technology, there's an incredible sort of gap in the industry right now where we actually need way more entry-level folks into the industry than ever before. And I think, importantly, that entry-level job is still transformative income. This is life-changing money and, by extension, community-changing money. ZOMORODI: It sounds like your life is just completely different, much more than you ever could have imagined as a child. And now, like, in some ways, you want to help people realize that, you know, they can do this, too. And maybe they don't need to be so surprised or shocked at what they're capable of or what they can achieve. Like, everyone should have that opportunity. They shouldn't doubt it. And maybe they should even expect it. OLGUIN: Yeah. You know, there are these moments - that experience where, during that very first job, pulling down a check I'd never seen four digits on before (laughter), you know? And you realize that, like, even without a whole lot of skill, you're going to out-earn anything you could have ever done, you know, in a different industry or in agriculture. It was a really big deal for me. But then you have to ask yourself what kind of person you're going to be when you are not constantly in survival mode. That is awesome. And there's a lot of agency there. There's a lot of accomplishment. But it's so dark. Your entire existence, you understood the world to be one thing, which was a fight. And you put on your armor every single day. And you go get it. And now you realize that there's a different way to exist. And you have to ask yourself, well, what am I going to do with my armor? Is that still mine? Do I carry that around? So, yeah, there is a lot of questioning yourself. I'm talking to you today from a pretty nice hotel room in a pretty nice city. And I got here on a plane that I never would have dreamed of 15 years ago, taking this trip to think about the expansion of our company. But it's not comfortable. I don't know if I'm ever going to feel comfortable taking advantage of all of the privileges that are afforded to me by this work. And so what do you do with that angst? The only thing I know how to do is to put that energy back into the work and make sure that you're not the only one who gets to experience these moments. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ZOMORODI: That's Irma Olguin, the co-founder and CEO of Bitwise Industries. You can see her full talk at ted. com. On the show today, work - the first part in our series Work, Play, Rest. I'm Manoush Zomorodi. And you're listening to the TED Radio Hour from NPR. Stay with us.

You know, there are these moments - that experience where, during that very first job, pulling down a check I'd never seen four digits on before (laughter), you know? And you realize that, like, even without a whole lot of skill, you're going to out-earn anything you could have ever done, you know, in a different industry or in agriculture. It was a really big deal for me. But then you have to ask yourself what kind of person you're going to be when you are not constantly in survival mode. That is awesome. And there's a lot of agency there. There's a lot of accomplishment. But it's so dark. Your entire existence, you understood the world to be one thing, which was a fight. And you put on your armor every single day. And you go get it. And now you realize that there's a different way to exist. And you have to ask yourself, well, what am I going to do with my armor? Is that still mine? Do I carry that around? So, yeah, there is a lot of questioning yourself. I'm talking to you today from a pretty nice hotel room in a pretty nice city. And I got here on a plane that I never would have dreamed of 15 years ago, taking this trip to think about the expansion of our company. But it's not comfortable. I don't know if I'm ever going to feel comfortable taking advantage of all of the privileges that are afforded to me by this work. And so what do you do with that angst? The only thing I know how to do is to put that energy back into the work and make sure that you're not the only one who gets to experience these moments.

Warehouse workers there are going to vote for a second time on whether to unionize. We should note Amazon is among NPR's sponsors, but we cover it like any other company. NPR's Alina Selyukh is here to talk more about this. Good morning, Alina. ALINA SELYUKH, BYLINE: Hello, hello. MARTIN: So this already happened. I mean, last year, there was a vote at this same warehouse. The union lost. Why are they voting again? SELYUKH: Right. So this is a massive warehouse in Bessemer, Ala. , with over 60,00 workers. And you're right. Last year, workers there overwhelmingly rejected the union. Almost three-quarters of voters said no to unionizing. But that vote was scrapped. The Federal Labor Board later ruled that Amazon, quote, \"essentially hijacked\" the election by having the U. S. Postal Service install a mailbox right by the warehouse. Amazon put its own tent over it. Workers said they felt the company controlled and monitored their voting. And the labor board ordered a redo, a new mail-in election, which begins today. It's a new chapter in labor's effort to create Amazon's first unionized warehouse in the U. S. MARTIN: Wow. What else, if anything, has changed since the last time they voted? SELYUKH: Well, sure. The warehouse itself has seen huge turnover. For roughly half the workers, this will actually be the first time voting on a union because they got hired in the past year. So the new vote is not exactly a replay. It's more of a remix. Pro-union workers like Kristina Bell, of course, hope this also means a different outcome. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)KRISTINA BELL: The loss was a blessing because guess what? It's making us motivated to win even more. SELYUKH: Bell spoke on a press call by the retail union that's helping workers organize. And she pointed out there were hundreds of workers who simply did not vote last time. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BELL: After we lost that vote, you how many people said, I should have voted? So it's a lot of mind changing. SELYUKH: Pro-union workers also say this time, their organizing group is much bigger. They're a lot more outspoken and engaged. MARTIN: All right. So that's what the pro-union workers are doing differently. What about Amazon? Has the company changed its approach to the unionizing effort? SELYUKH: You know, not much. It's still opposes unionization. Bessemer workers still got mandatory information sessions arguing unions were not necessary. Amazon touts its benefits, its average starting pay of $18 an hour. But Amazon is also under escalating scrutiny for its anti-union activity. The company recently had to agree to a deal with federal labor officials that required changes to how pro-union workers are treated. Amazon also had to notify hundreds of thousands of workers about their labor rights. And, of course, another big development is now there are two more Amazon warehouses that are pursuing a union vote. And both of them are in New York. MARTIN: I mean, there has been a lot of activity in the world of organized labor this past year. . . SELYUKH: Indeed. MARTIN: . . . Hasn't there? - strikes and walkouts. Some Starbucks workers have unionized, right? SELYUKH: Yes, two Starbucks stores in New York voted to unionize. And now we're looking at over 50 more that are petitioning for union elections. At the same time, you know, union membership in this country is at historic lows. And generally, large union campaigns like we're watching here with Amazon - they can take years and multiple elections.

BRIAN NAYLOR, BYLINE: First of all, let's be clear - the IRS was not requiring that every taxpayer filing their returns submit a selfie. But the agency signed a contract with a private company to verify the IDs of people who wanted to see their past returns or get information about child tax credit payments and a few other things. Still, it was an overreach, says Emily Tucker, director of the Center on Privacy and Technology at the Georgetown Law School. EMILY TUCKER: The consequences of not agreeing to give up a photo of yourself, which is then stored in a corporate database, which is protected only by that corporation's own easily changeable privacy policies, is that you may not be able to comply with federal tax law under some circumstances. NAYLOR: The IRS had contracted out the ID verification to a private company called ID. me. They're the ones taxpayers would submit their photos to. And they're the ones who would keep them in their files. Jeramie Scott is senior counsel at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, known as EPIC. He says one of the problems with outsourcing this information is whether it's kept safe. JERAMIE SCOTT: What it does is it creates another target for criminals. Obviously, data breaches are a big issue. And, you know, the more areas that sensitive information is, the more likely it will be the target of a data breach.

And a number of states are also using the software to, among other things, check the identities of those applying for unemployment benefits. Emily Tucker says that's a problem. TUCKER: Federal and state bureaucracies should just not have the power to make the ability to buy groceries or drive a car or pay your taxes, or do the other things you need to do to survive contingent on giving up your biometric information. NAYLOR: Tucker and other privacy advocates say another problem with facial recognition software is that it's not always accurate, especially in differentiating between whites and people of color.

The question is how they're used. NAYLOR: Still, there was growing pushback from lawmakers to the IRS' use of ID. me. Democratic Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, who chairs the Senate Finance Committee, wrote the IRS, urging it reverse its decision to use the company. Hall says the government has some choices to make.

People are spending billions of dollars on NFTs. They are seen as a new digital frontier to buy, trade and sell goods. But this new frontier is still pretty wild. Nike is suing the online resale platform StockX for trademark infringement. StockX operates what it calls a Vault NFT. Here's NPR's Elizabeth Blair. ELIZABETH BLAIR, BYLINE: If you're confused about NFTs, here's some sage advice from attorney Rhett Millsaps. RHETT MILLSAPS: You might want to look up the dictionary definition of NFT. Actually, you know, it's in all the dictionaries now. BLAIR: Millsaps represents an artist who's being sued over his NFTs. Merriam Webster defines a nonfungible token as a unique digital identifier that cannot be copied, substituted or subdivided that is recorded in a blockchain and that is used to certify authenticity and ownership. In other words, an NFT is not the actual thing you bought but proof that you bought it. Don't feel bad if you're still confused, says trademark lawyer Moish Peltz. MOISH PELTZ: One of the hallmarks of a trademark infringement case is whether there's consumer confusion. And it's like, well, everyone's confused because NFTs are confusing. BLAIR: And yet some of the age-old reason someone would sue for trademark infringement still apply. StockX is an online marketplace where you can buy Nike products, including sneakers. But Nike says StockX is not an authorized Nike retailer. Nike's lawsuit says StockX is minting NFTs that prominently use Nike's trademarks. StockX sent NPR a statement, saying the lawsuit lacks merit. StockX says, quote, \"its Vault NFTs depict and represent proof of ownership of physical goods stored in our vault that customers can trade on our platform. \" Trademark lawyer Moish Peltz says the idea is that those NFTs represent real sneakers. PELTZ: If you purchase a StockX Vault NFT, you would have the right to exchange that NFT for the physical shoe. BLAIR: Or, he says, they could be traded or resold. PELTZ: So you could trade one NFT for another. You could trade one NFT for several other NFTs. You could sell it for more or less than you bought it for. BLAIR: For example, on the StockX site, a pair of women's Nike Air VaporMax has gone from a sale price of $600 to $2,000 in less than a month. Dinusha Mendis, a professor of intellectual property and innovation law at Bournemouth University, says that can get a trademark holder's attention. DINUSHA MENDIS: So if you're buying an NFT sneaker and it does have a trademark on it, like Nike, for you to go and resell it and you sell at a higher price, you know, if there's no association with Nike, then there might be an infringement there. BLAIR: Nike itself is getting in on the NFT sensation through its purchase of a digital art studio active in the metaverse. In its lawsuit, Nike says StockX's Vault NFTs are likely to confuse consumers in that marketplace and jeopardize Nike's trademark. Elizabeth Blair, NPR News.

I'm Manoush Zomorodi. And today on the show, the power of play. STUART DUNCAN: So I've always been a gamer my whole life. But, of course, for me, gaming was, you know, taking rolls of quarters to the arcade. ZOMORODI: This is Stuart Duncan. DUNCAN: And they had all the classics like Street Fighter and Mortal Kombat. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)DUNCAN: But even older than that, we had, like, the old tabletop games - Pac-Man, Centipede (laughter), those old, old classics on a table. Like, I literally - I had one of those actual huge boxes with a knob at each end of the thing and a switch in the middle, and that was Pong. And I always thought of it as a tool to increase my problem-solving, my hand-eye coordination, my reflexes, all that sort of stuff. I got better at things because of trying to figure out these video games. ZOMORODI: Fast forward, and video games have changed. But so has Stuart. He's a web developer and a single dad. DUNCAN: Yeah, I have two teenage sons, 16 and 14. The oldest is Cameron. He is autistic. And his younger brother, Tyler, is not autistic. ZOMORODI: And when Cameron was diagnosed, Stuart realized that maybe playing video games could be a way to help his son. DUNCAN: We were getting him into speech therapy, occupational therapy. He - and to this day, still struggles with motor control. So - and the beginning was gross motor control, you know, just doing the really big movements. And then, of course, eventually, the fine motor control - writing with a pencil and stuff like that. And I had the idea - if you remember the Wii, the first one, the controller - you could put it into a steering wheel and play Mario Kart, and you would drive it like a car, like an actual steering wheel. (SOUNDBTIE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)CHARLES MARTINET: (As Mario) Woo (ph). DUNCAN: And I put the wheel in his hand, and all he had to do was turn his hands a little bit and press one button to make it go. He didn't have to coordinate, do any button combinations, none of that stuff. And, of course, at first, he would twist his arms all the way around. So, you know, Mario was just spinning on the track and stuff. But over time, he started to get the smaller movements, the gradual turns, this and that, and knowing when to back up and stuff like that. And he picked that stuff up. And then he started beating me in races. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MARTINET: (As Mario) Mario's No. 1. DUNCAN: So he developed really good gross motor skill controls by playing Mario Kart on the Wii. They've been gamers ever since. ZOMORODI: So you started with Mario Kart. But at some point, you guys discovered Minecraft - right? - which is pretty much one of the most popular online games ever. But for people who haven't played it, just describe it, Stuart. What is Minecraft? How does it work? DUNCAN: So basically, you start Minecraft - it literally plops you into the middle of a randomly generated world. So your world will not be the same as anybody else's. And there'll be trees. There'll be oceans. There'll be deserts. There'll be little animals running around, like chickens and cows and stuff. And then at night, monsters come out. And you're basically just left to fend for yourself in this gigantic, open, infinite world where you can do just about anything your imagination can think of. ZOMORODI: And that's because everything is kind of made out of these virtual blocks, right? DUNCAN: Yeah. ZOMORODI: You can build the house of your dreams with a pool. You can build a mansion. It is like Lego on steroids. DUNCAN: And that's kind of the beauty of it. Like, I describe it as, there's no wrong way to play. Like, nobody can tell you you're doing it wrong. Like, yeah, some people do exactly that. They'll make themselves a nice little house with a pool and a garden. Other people build castles and entire medieval villages around them. Some people recreate the landscapes in \"Lord Of The Rings. \" One person built a Nintendo emulator inside of Minecraft. So they were actually playing Mario Brothers inside of Minecraft because the game is just that robust. There's just so much to it that, literally, when I say there's no limit, there really is no limit. ZOMORODI: But Stuart started noticing a downside to Minecraft. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)DUNCAN: I saw parents on social media reaching out to other parents, asking if their autistic children could play together. And the reason is that when they tried to play on public servers, they kept running into bullies and trolls. ZOMORODI: Here's Stuart Duncan on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)DUNCAN: When you have autism, you behave a little differently sometimes - sometimes a lot differently. And we all know that a little bit of difference is all you really need for a bully to make you their next target. So these terrible, terrible people online, they would destroy everything that they tried to make. They would steal all their stuff, and they would kill them over and over again, making the game virtually unplayable. But the worst part, the part that really hurt the most, was what these bullies would say to these kids. They'd call them rejects and defects and retards. And they would tell these kids, some as young as 6 years old, that society doesn't want them and their own parents never wanted a broken child, so they should just kill themselves. And, of course, these kids, you understand, they would sign off from these servers angry and hurt. They would break their keyboards. They'd quite literally hate themselves, and their parents felt powerless to do anything. So I decided I had to try and help. I have autism, my oldest son has autism and both my kids and I love Minecraft. So I have to do something. So I got myself a Minecraft server. ZOMORODI: Stuart, this is so upsetting to hear what these kids experienced online. They just wanted a fun place to play. But you saw that and you thought, you know, maybe I can fix this. DUNCAN: Yeah, yeah. I don't know. It was starting to break my heart the more and more and more I saw it because you keep seeing people saying, I wish there was a server where my kids could play. I wish that they could play without being - I wish there were - and I saw a need for these kids to be able to play together where that sort of behavior wouldn't be allowed. Now, keeping in mind - I had a full-time job at the time. I have two kids. I was busy enough already. But to me, I thought, maybe we'd get a few hundred people to join the server, and it would be something I could do in my spare time and just give them this place where trolls wouldn't be able to get in. But little did I know what I was getting myself into. There was a whole lot more need for it than I ever realized. I spent about two weeks building a really makeshift village. I put a big welcome sign in the sky so that people felt welcomed. I built a lodge on a mountaintop so people could gather - just basic little things that, you know, were just the worst. Compared to any other Minecraft servers - it was so bad. But it would be theirs, and it would be safe. So I built it up. Two weeks later, I go on Facebook. And I post it to my friends - which is a list of, like, 300 people on Facebook - just to see. And I said, I started a Minecraft server. It's just for children with autism and their families. Other people are welcome to join - like, you know, brothers, sisters, friends, and that's it. That was, like, literally two sentences shared to my friends. And I got about 750 emails in the first two days. ZOMORODI: Oh, my gosh (laughter). DUNCAN: Word just spread like wildfire. There was just - the autism community just came together and went, you need to know about this. ZOMORODI: Stuart named his Minecraft world Autcraft. And there were guidelines, rules. No breaking things or stealing. No fighting or killing. No cursing or being mean. And parents and friends would be there to enforce these rules and just make sure kids were having fun. DUNCAN: And it was pretty amazing because it just - it formed this really close, supportive, encouraging family, like, almost instantly. Everybody was there for each other. Everybody - when somebody had a bad day, everybody would be like, oh, it's OK. You can talk to us if you need to. You know, tell us all about it or whatever. And a lot of them just never used the chat, never opened up, never talked. They were afraid of awkward situations, of being teased about this or that or - but pretty much from Day 1 that Autcraft opened, these kids would come in, be quiet. And the talkative ones would say, this is how you can do this. This is how you can get this protected and stuff and everything. And they would open up. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)DUNCAN: I started hearing from parents who said that their nonverbal children were starting to speak. They only talked about Minecraft, but they were talking. (LAUGHTER)DUNCAN: Some kids were making friends at school for the first time ever. Some were starting to share and even give things to other people. It was amazing. And every single parent came to me and said it was because of Autcraft. It's because of what you're doing. But why, though? How could all of this be just from a video game server? Well, that goes back to the guidelines that I used when I created the server, guidelines that I think help encourage people to be their very best, I hope. For example, communication - that can be tough for kids with autism. It can be tough for grown-ups without autism. But I think that kids should not be punished. They should be talked to. Nine times out of 10, when the kids on the server act out, it's because of something else that's happened in the day at school or at home. Maybe a pet died. Sometimes it's just a simple miscommunication between two children. They don't tell the other person what they're about to do. And so we just offer to help. We always tell the children on the server that we're not mad and they're not in trouble. We only want to help. And it shows that not only do we care, but we respect them enough to listen to their point of view. On most servers, players are rewarded for how well they do in a competition, right? The better you do, the better reward you get. That sort of thing can be automated. The server does the work. The code is there. On Autcraft, we don't do that. We have things like Player of the Week and CBAs, which is Caught Being Awesome. Our top award, the AutismFather Sword, which is named after me because I'm the founder, is a very powerful sword that you can't get in the game any other way than to show that you completely put the community above yourself and that compassion and kindness is at the core of who you are. We've given away quite a few of those swords, actually. I figure if we're going to watch the server to make sure nothing bad happens, we should also watch for the good things that happen and reward people for them. ZOMORODI: So, Stuart, the world you have described in Autcraft - it sounds fair, almost utopian for kids with autism and their families. But I guess I need to ask, you know, does this really prepare these kids for reality? I mean, the world is not a nice place where people follow the rules or get called out for bad behavior and then coached to communicate better. Some might think that you're coddling kids in this place and that it will not serve them when they need to fend for themselves in the real world. DUNCAN: Yeah, yeah. I hear that a lot, and I also hear, you know, these kids should be learning these social skills face to face and not online. ZOMORODI: Yeah. So what do you say to that? DUNCAN: I would say I would prefer a child to make mistakes without fear of being harshly punished for it. I want them to learn from their mistakes and be encouraged to make mistakes, to learn right from wrong rather than just walk away going, I don't know what I did wrong. Some of them are in their late teens, early 20s, and it's really hard for them to filter themselves so that what they say and do is adequate for, like, a 6- or 7-year-old. But they do it, and, you know, like, it's a lot of being constricted by rules just like society but also having the freedom to be able to make all the mistakes they want and try all the things they want without fear of, you know, just being shut down and hurt and bullied for it. I'll give you this example from last Christmas, one year ago. This kid joined the server in 2013, way back when. And I believe he was, like, 12 at the time. So you think, like, eight years ago or seven years ago, at the time, he was 12 years old. He had joined the server. And he was quiet and shy and super-scared because he was about to go into high school. And so we supported him. And we were there for him. And we talked about it. And it was hard, and studying and homework and all of this stuff for four years - and then after that came university. And then he was really scared about university. And he went through that. And he did all that sort of stuff. And then he kind of dropped off the server because he was busy, obviously. And then he came back last Christmas, near the end of the year. And I was like, hey. I haven't seen you in a while. It's good to see you and everything. He says, listen. He messaged me privately. He says, I just wanted to come back. I'm so happy to see the server is still here and doing well. So I wanted to tell you that, like, when I joined, I was 12. He said, I never would have made it through high school. I never would have been able to join the social clubs and do well. He said, I never - I probably never would have went to university and been outspoken and done the stuff I wanted to do if I had never been on Autcraft. And now I'm back specifically to tell you that I just got my dream job at Lego headquarters. ZOMORODI: (Laughter) Wow. DUNCAN: And he's telling me, you know - he says, I owe so much to Autcraft because I learned how to make friends and to join groups and to be, like, a team leader on projects - and this and that and, you know, get involved with other people and do stuff. And he's like, I just - I'm so happy to see Autcraft is still here and doing well. And I was like, that just made my whole year(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ZOMORODI: Like, seriously, though, how do you do all this, Stuart, because on the one hand, you're the admin? So you're actually - you know, technically, you're in charge of all of this. But then it also sounds like you are acting as therapist and referee and CEO. And, I mean, this is your full-time job now, right? DUNCAN: I wish I only did the hours of a full-time job. (LAUGHTER)ZOMORODI: But did you give up your other. . . DUNCAN: Yeah. ZOMORODI: . . . Your, quote-unquote, \"real job\" to do this? DUNCAN: Yeah. My job was struggling. I wasn't able to meet deadlines. I was having to, like - I was, like, in the middle of meetings saying, oh, can we continue this a little bit later? There's a player that needs me right now. ZOMORODI: Oh (laughter). DUNCAN: Yeah. My - I wasn't able to keep up with the two because, literally, Autcraft - I wake up usually 7 a. m. And I check on everything. And I'm continuing right up until midnight. ZOMORODI: Who is paying you? DUNCAN: Supporters. I took a huge - I still, to this day, don't make as much as I did as a web developer. But it was enough that I was able to cover my bills. It's - you know, you hear from these parents who say that their children are happy. One person tweeted that their son said that they had the most amazing day. And she never thought she would ever hear that from them again. Like, it's been forever. So that's that reward (laughter). ZOMORODI: So Stuart, I have to ask, do you have a message for parents, parents of kids who are obsessed with playing Minecraft, whether they are autistic or not? And maybe these parents just don't get it. Like, what do you say to them? DUNCAN: I don't know how much you know about the autism community. But there's one specific expression that comes up a lot. And it's, your child is not ignoring you. They're waiting for you to enter their world. And I can think of no more literal interpretation of that than Minecraft. Like, pick up a controller or mouse and keyboard and join them in their world. And you will find, like, the most meaningful bond with your child that you've ever had, because then you start planning builds. You start planning adventures. You're having a great time. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)DUNCAN: And I love nothing more on my server than when I see entire families, four or five people - mom, dad, kids. We recently had a mom just join. She's, on her application - hope she doesn't mind. I'm not telling her name. But she's 60. And she's joining in to play with her son. And she's having a great time. And if I could get parents to know one thing, it's simply just join them. If 5 and 6-year-olds can figure this out, if they can sit in front of a screen and figure out the controls, then you can, too. You just have to put in the effort. And it's worth it. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ZOMORODI: That's Stuart Duncan. He runs Autcraft, a Minecraft server for kids with autism and their families. You can see his full talk at ted. com. Just thinking back on this episode, we heard how play inspires Jacob Collier's unique style and how Yana uses it to change people's minds. My takeaway is - and maybe yours is, too - that the spirit of joy, curiosity and just plain fun can lead to so many unexpected outcomes. Next week, the final episode in our series Work, Play, Rest. Get ready for some unusual ideas about how we relax and reset.

What is Minecraft? How does it work? DUNCAN: So basically, you start Minecraft - it literally plops you into the middle of a randomly generated world. So your world will not be the same as anybody else's. And there'll be trees. There'll be oceans. There'll be deserts. There'll be little animals running around, like chickens and cows and stuff. And then at night, monsters come out. And you're basically just left to fend for yourself in this gigantic, open, infinite world where you can do just about anything your imagination can think of. ZOMORODI: And that's because everything is kind of made out of these virtual blocks, right? DUNCAN: Yeah. ZOMORODI: You can build the house of your dreams with a pool. You can build a mansion. It is like Lego on steroids. DUNCAN: And that's kind of the beauty of it. Like, I describe it as, there's no wrong way to play. Like, nobody can tell you you're doing it wrong. Like, yeah, some people do exactly that. They'll make themselves a nice little house with a pool and a garden. Other people build castles and entire medieval villages around them. Some people recreate the landscapes in \"Lord Of The Rings. \" One person built a Nintendo emulator inside of Minecraft. So they were actually playing Mario Brothers inside of Minecraft because the game is just that robust. There's just so much to it that, literally, when I say there's no limit, there really is no limit. ZOMORODI: But Stuart started noticing a downside to Minecraft. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) DUNCAN: I saw parents on social media reaching out to other parents, asking if their autistic children could play together. And the reason is that when they tried to play on public servers, they kept running into bullies and trolls. ZOMORODI: Here's Stuart Duncan on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) DUNCAN: When you have autism, you behave a little differently sometimes - sometimes a lot differently. And we all know that a little bit of difference is all you really need for a bully to make you their next target. So these terrible, terrible people online, they would destroy everything that they tried to make. They would steal all their stuff, and they would kill them over and over again, making the game virtually unplayable. But the worst part, the part that really hurt the most, was what these bullies would say to these kids. They'd call them rejects and defects and retards. And they would tell these kids, some as young as 6 years old, that society doesn't want them and their own parents never wanted a broken child, so they should just kill themselves. And, of course, these kids, you understand, they would sign off from these servers angry and hurt. They would break their keyboards. They'd quite literally hate themselves, and their parents felt powerless to do anything. So I decided I had to try and help. I have autism, my oldest son has autism and both my kids and I love Minecraft. So I have to do something. So I got myself a Minecraft server. ZOMORODI: Stuart, this is so upsetting to hear what these kids experienced online. They just wanted a fun place to play. But you saw that and you thought, you know, maybe I can fix this. DUNCAN: Yeah, yeah. I don't know. It was starting to break my heart the more and more and more I saw it because you keep seeing people saying, I wish there was a server where my kids could play. I wish that they could play without being - I wish there were - and I saw a need for these kids to be able to play together where that sort of behavior wouldn't be allowed. Now, keeping in mind - I had a full-time job at the time. I have two kids. I was busy enough already. But to me, I thought, maybe we'd get a few hundred people to join the server, and it would be something I could do in my spare time and just give them this place where trolls wouldn't be able to get in. But little did I know what I was getting myself into. There was a whole lot more need for it than I ever realized. I spent about two weeks building a really makeshift village. I put a big welcome sign in the sky so that people felt welcomed. I built a lodge on a mountaintop so people could gather - just basic little things that, you know, were just the worst. Compared to any other Minecraft servers - it was so bad. But it would be theirs, and it would be safe. So I built it up. Two weeks later, I go on Facebook. And I post it to my friends - which is a list of, like, 300 people on Facebook - just to see. And I said, I started a Minecraft server. It's just for children with autism and their families. Other people are welcome to join - like, you know, brothers, sisters, friends, and that's it. That was, like, literally two sentences shared to my friends. And I got about 750 emails in the first two days. ZOMORODI: Oh, my gosh (laughter). DUNCAN: Word just spread like wildfire. There was just - the autism community just came together and went, you need to know about this. ZOMORODI: Stuart named his Minecraft world Autcraft. And there were guidelines, rules. No breaking things or stealing. No fighting or killing. No cursing or being mean. And parents and friends would be there to enforce these rules and just make sure kids were having fun. DUNCAN: And it was pretty amazing because it just - it formed this really close, supportive, encouraging family, like, almost instantly. Everybody was there for each other. Everybody - when somebody had a bad day, everybody would be like, oh, it's OK. You can talk to us if you need to. You know, tell us all about it or whatever. And a lot of them just never used the chat, never opened up, never talked. They were afraid of awkward situations, of being teased about this or that or - but pretty much from Day 1 that Autcraft opened, these kids would come in, be quiet. And the talkative ones would say, this is how you can do this. This is how you can get this protected and stuff and everything. And they would open up. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) DUNCAN: I started hearing from parents who said that their nonverbal children were starting to speak. They only talked about Minecraft, but they were talking. (LAUGHTER) DUNCAN: Some kids were making friends at school for the first time ever. Some were starting to share and even give things to other people. It was amazing. And every single parent came to me and said it was because of Autcraft. It's because of what you're doing. But why, though? How could all of this be just from a video game server? Well, that goes back to the guidelines that I used when I created the server, guidelines that I think help encourage people to be their very best, I hope. For example, communication - that can be tough for kids with autism. It can be tough for grown-ups without autism. But I think that kids should not be punished. They should be talked to. Nine times out of 10, when the kids on the server act out, it's because of something else that's happened in the day at school or at home. Maybe a pet died. Sometimes it's just a simple miscommunication between two children. They don't tell the other person what they're about to do. And so we just offer to help. We always tell the children on the server that we're not mad and they're not in trouble. We only want to help. And it shows that not only do we care, but we respect them enough to listen to their point of view. On most servers, players are rewarded for how well they do in a competition, right? The better you do, the better reward you get. That sort of thing can be automated. The server does the work. The code is there. On Autcraft, we don't do that. We have things like Player of the Week and CBAs, which is Caught Being Awesome. Our top award, the AutismFather Sword, which is named after me because I'm the founder, is a very powerful sword that you can't get in the game any other way than to show that you completely put the community above yourself and that compassion and kindness is at the core of who you are. We've given away quite a few of those swords, actually. I figure if we're going to watch the server to make sure nothing bad happens, we should also watch for the good things that happen and reward people for them. ZOMORODI: So, Stuart, the world you have described in Autcraft - it sounds fair, almost utopian for kids with autism and their families. But I guess I need to ask, you know, does this really prepare these kids for reality? I mean, the world is not a nice place where people follow the rules or get called out for bad behavior and then coached to communicate better. Some might think that you're coddling kids in this place and that it will not serve them when they need to fend for themselves in the real world. DUNCAN: Yeah, yeah. I hear that a lot, and I also hear, you know, these kids should be learning these social skills face to face and not online. ZOMORODI: Yeah. So what do you say to that? DUNCAN: I would say I would prefer a child to make mistakes without fear of being harshly punished for it. I want them to learn from their mistakes and be encouraged to make mistakes, to learn right from wrong rather than just walk away going, I don't know what I did wrong. Some of them are in their late teens, early 20s, and it's really hard for them to filter themselves so that what they say and do is adequate for, like, a 6- or 7-year-old. But they do it, and, you know, like, it's a lot of being constricted by rules just like society but also having the freedom to be able to make all the mistakes they want and try all the things they want without fear of, you know, just being shut down and hurt and bullied for it. I'll give you this example from last Christmas, one year ago. This kid joined the server in 2013, way back when. And I believe he was, like, 12 at the time. So you think, like, eight years ago or seven years ago, at the time, he was 12 years old. He had joined the server. And he was quiet and shy and super-scared because he was about to go into high school. And so we supported him. And we were there for him. And we talked about it. And it was hard, and studying and homework and all of this stuff for four years - and then after that came university. And then he was really scared about university. And he went through that. And he did all that sort of stuff. And then he kind of dropped off the server because he was busy, obviously. And then he came back last Christmas, near the end of the year. And I was like, hey. I haven't seen you in a while. It's good to see you and everything. He says, listen. He messaged me privately. He says, I just wanted to come back. I'm so happy to see the server is still here and doing well. So I wanted to tell you that, like, when I joined, I was 12. He said, I never would have made it through high school. I never would have been able to join the social clubs and do well. He said, I never - I probably never would have went to university and been outspoken and done the stuff I wanted to do if I had never been on Autcraft. And now I'm back specifically to tell you that I just got my dream job at Lego headquarters. ZOMORODI: (Laughter) Wow. DUNCAN: And he's telling me, you know - he says, I owe so much to Autcraft because I learned how to make friends and to join groups and to be, like, a team leader on projects - and this and that and, you know, get involved with other people and do stuff. And he's like, I just - I'm so happy to see Autcraft is still here and doing well. And I was like, that just made my whole year (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ZOMORODI: Like, seriously, though, how do you do all this, Stuart, because on the one hand, you're the admin? So you're actually - you know, technically, you're in charge of all of this. But then it also sounds like you are acting as therapist and referee and CEO. And, I mean, this is your full-time job now, right? DUNCAN: I wish I only did the hours of a full-time job. (LAUGHTER) ZOMORODI: But did you give up your other. . . DUNCAN: Yeah. ZOMORODI: . . . Your, quote-unquote, \"real job\" to do this? DUNCAN: Yeah. My job was struggling. I wasn't able to meet deadlines. I was having to, like - I was, like, in the middle of meetings saying, oh, can we continue this a little bit later? There's a player that needs me right now. ZOMORODI: Oh (laughter). DUNCAN: Yeah. My - I wasn't able to keep up with the two because, literally, Autcraft - I wake up usually 7 a. m. And I check on everything. And I'm continuing right up until midnight. ZOMORODI: Who is paying you? DUNCAN: Supporters. I took a huge - I still, to this day, don't make as much as I did as a web developer. But it was enough that I was able to cover my bills. It's - you know, you hear from these parents who say that their children are happy. One person tweeted that their son said that they had the most amazing day. And she never thought she would ever hear that from them again. Like, it's been forever. So that's that reward (laughter). ZOMORODI: So Stuart, I have to ask, do you have a message for parents, parents of kids who are obsessed with playing Minecraft, whether they are autistic or not? And maybe these parents just don't get it. Like, what do you say to them? DUNCAN: I don't know how much you know about the autism community. But there's one specific expression that comes up a lot. And it's, your child is not ignoring you. They're waiting for you to enter their world. And I can think of no more literal interpretation of that than Minecraft. Like, pick up a controller or mouse and keyboard and join them in their world. And you will find, like, the most meaningful bond with your child that you've ever had, because then you start planning builds. You start planning adventures. You're having a great time. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) DUNCAN: And I love nothing more on my server than when I see entire families, four or five people - mom, dad, kids. We recently had a mom just join. She's, on her application - hope she doesn't mind. I'm not telling her name. But she's 60. And she's joining in to play with her son. And she's having a great time. And if I could get parents to know one thing, it's simply just join them. If 5 and 6-year-olds can figure this out, if they can sit in front of a screen and figure out the controls, then you can, too. You just have to put in the effort. And it's worth it. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ZOMORODI: That's Stuart Duncan. He runs Autcraft, a Minecraft server for kids with autism and their families. You can see his full talk at ted. com. Just thinking back on this episode, we heard how play inspires Jacob Collier's unique style and how Yana uses it to change people's minds. My takeaway is - and maybe yours is, too - that the spirit of joy, curiosity and just plain fun can lead to so many unexpected outcomes. Next week, the final episode in our series Work, Play, Rest. Get ready for some unusual ideas about how we relax and reset.

But those fans will be seeing much more than just football. They'll also be watching the widely celebrated Super Bowl TV ads. So we're going to start today by talking about those ads, two kinds in particular. We'll touch on the big push around cryptocurrency and NFTs in a minute, but first, let's talk about sports betting companies. You're going to see a lot of those ads. The sports gambling industry has exploded in the last four years, and operators are now racing to get as many customers on their platforms as quickly as possible. Some are worried about this trend. New York Attorney General Letitia James last week issued an alert urging consumers to watch out for possibly deceptive or misleading ads from betting companies. NPR's Joe Hernandez has been looking into the rise of sports betting, and he is with us now to tell us more. Joe, welcome. Thanks so much for joining us. JOE HERNANDEZ, BYLINE: Oh, thank you. MARTIN: It seems like even before the Super Bowl, we've been seeing a lot of TV ads for sports gambling companies recently. Why is that? HERNANDEZ: Yeah. This goes back to 2018, when the Supreme Court handed down a decision that revoked the national federal ban on sports betting outside of Nevada. And that really opened the floodgates for states to get in on legalized sports betting. Now there are 30 states and Washington, D. C. , that have sports betting, and more are on the way. And it's so - it's a kind of young industry, but it's growing very rapidly, and more states are joining in every year. So sportsbooks are looking at this trend and saying they want to get as many customers as possible as quickly as they can, so they're spending big on advertising right now. MARTIN: How much are they spending? How much money are these betting companies spending on advertising? HERNANDEZ: Millions of dollars, sometimes even hundreds of millions. The research firm MediaRadar estimated that the gambling industry as a whole, which includes sportsbooks, spent $488 million on advertising between November 2020 and November '21. I spoke with Adam Candee. He's managing editor of the trade publication Legal Sports Report, and he was telling me that sportsbooks are looking at this as the moment to spend a boatload of money on advertising. ADAM CANDEE: It is happening in the here and now, moment to moment as they compete for customers. That is because this is essentially a new industry that is rising up from the ground, and you have early movers who are heavily capitalized trying to acquire as much market share as they possibly can. HERNANDEZ: And so this is sort of like the business model that Amazon and other companies had, which is, you're willing to lose a little bit of money at the outset while you're building up your customer base, and then you hope those people stay with you in the long run and help you make that money back and earn even more. MARTIN: So how big are these companies going on advertising for the Super Bowl? I mean, I guess I'm going to see a lot of sports betting ads and fewer chip ads (laughter). HERNANDEZ: (Laughter) I think we're going to see a lot of sports betting ads in our lives generally for the years to come. They're going to be spending millions again. Three of these companies, which are sort of the top-tier partners of the NFL, are Caesars Sportsbook, DraftKings and FanDuel. FanDuel is rolling out ads before the game and some local in-game ads during the Super Bowl. Caesars and DraftKings are going to be even bigger. They're airing national in-game spots. And NBC, which is broadcasting the Super Bowl, said some of those in-game spots were going for as much as $7 million for 30 seconds of airtime, which sounds like a lot of money, but over 100 million people are expected to watch the Super Bowl. And this is not just some random assortment of people; it's sports fans. So sportsbooks are hoping to sell themselves at this crucial moment. MARTIN: You know, I just think for people of a certain age, this is quite jarring because the major sports leagues used to be very much against sports betting. And, you know, some of the major scandals in sports had to do with gambling. So now they're partnering with sports betting companies. What's been going on there? HERNANDEZ: Yeah. It's been a huge reversal for pro sports. Sports leagues, including the NFL, were against sports betting for many years, and they were worried in part about cheating and match-fixing. And even NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell once called gambling the No. 1 threat to the integrity of pro football. But when the Supreme Court decision came down, they sort of had no choice, and it's now legal in many states. And the NFL has embraced it, and they've even partnered with some of these sportsbooks. So it appears to be a sign that this industry is only growing larger and will become even more ubiquitous in the years to come. MARTIN: That was NPR's Joe Hernandez. Joe, thanks for your reporting.

But AI is also put to work in more serious ways, like facial recognition software by law enforcement. Some critics say there's a troubling lack of diversity among those who create the programs, and that is causing serious harm for people of color. We're joined now by Angle Bush. She's the founder of Black Women in A. I. , a company providing mentorship, education and empowerment for Black women in the field. Welcome. ANGLE BUSH: Thank you for having me. SNELL: So to start with, can you help us understand what's at stake here? You kind of give an example of how an AI program can get something wrong if it's created without diversity in mind. BUSH: When we have these products and services and softwares, we have to understand that what's at stake could literally be someone's life. For example, there was a young man in Detroit. He was actually arrested in front of his family based on facial recognition. And they showed him the photo, and he said, that is not me. But the officers proclaimed, well, the artificial intelligence says that it is you. And so it's a sad day in America when we have to prove that we're innocent. SNELL: How could code get something like that wrong? How could code just look at his face and say that he's somebody else? BUSH: It's all in the data. It's all in the algorithm. For example, if we wanted to train something on what a cat looks like, and we only put in black cats, for example, if you tried to identify an orange cat or a gray cat or something like that, the computer would not identify that because that is not a part of the dataset. SNELL: But this can apply not just to, you know, cases of the criminal justice system. I understand that this can apply to, you know, other parts of people's lives. What are other examples of ways poor AI code could impact somebody's daily life? BUSH: It can affect you and determine where you live, whether you get a loan for a home, your FICO score, your scores. It can determine a lot of different things as far as how your health care is provided. And in terms of the criminal justice system, some of the systems are determining whether people are allowed parole based on artificial intelligence and trying to remove the human that is in the loop. SNELL: Now, is this a situation of overt bias or racism, or is this unconscious bias, ways that people don't know that they are setting up a system to not properly serve all of the people who may be using it? BUSH: This is a system of unconscious bias when you don't have diversity, when you don't have people in the room to say, well, let's step back on this data, because what's happening is people are using historical data to solve current problems. SNELL: So can you explain a little bit more about why historical data in particular would be a problem? BUSH: Because the historical data doesn't necessarily represent what's happening in the world right now. Where are you getting this data from? Have you cleaned the data? Have you looked at the data to see if it reflects current trends? Was there diversity when you first collected the data, or is this based on your own bias? SNELL: Is this a problem of big tech companies not being welcoming to Black engineers? BUSH: It is. If the pandemic has taught us anything, companies are going to have to pivot and reimagine their company culture and what it takes to create a world where everyone feels welcome. And that's one of the things that Black Women in A. I. is definitely looking to do. SNELL: So you're talking about diversifying AI engineers. It seems like that's just one step that could target the issues surrounding this entire ecosystem. But it's also not an all-encompassing solution. Should we be reconsidering how AI is used in systems like the criminal justice system or even just in more innocuous ways in our lives? BUSH: Yes, exactly. I think what we have to do is take a step back. Unfortunately, we can't put everything back in the box, but we have to look at governance. It's very important that the government - the U. S. government and all other governments start to look at how this is affecting people's daily lives because as we know, artificial intelligence affects every aspect of our lives. And until we can get a hold and a grasp of how it's going to affect someone negatively, then we have to pause. SNELL: That was Angle Bush, founder of Black Women in A. I. Angle, thank you so much for being with us today. BUSH: Thank you so much for having me. KELSEY SNELL, HOST:   Every time you ask Alexa to turn on your lights or play a song, you're using AI. But AI is also put to work in more serious ways, like facial recognition software by law enforcement. Some critics say there's a troubling lack of diversity among those who create the programs, and that is causing serious harm for people of color. We're joined now by Angle Bush. She's the founder of Black Women in A. I. , a company providing mentorship, education and empowerment for Black women in the field. Welcome. ANGLE BUSH: Thank you for having me. SNELL: So to start with, can you help us understand what's at stake here? You kind of give an example of how an AI program can get something wrong if it's created without diversity in mind. BUSH: When we have these products and services and softwares, we have to understand that what's at stake could literally be someone's life. For example, there was a young man in Detroit. He was actually arrested in front of his family based on facial recognition. And they showed him the photo, and he said, that is not me. But the officers proclaimed, well, the artificial intelligence says that it is you. And so it's a sad day in America when we have to prove that we're innocent. SNELL: How could code get something like that wrong? How could code just look at his face and say that he's somebody else? BUSH: It's all in the data. It's all in the algorithm. For example, if we wanted to train something on what a cat looks like, and we only put in black cats, for example, if you tried to identify an orange cat or a gray cat or something like that, the computer would not identify that because that is not a part of the dataset. SNELL: But this can apply not just to, you know, cases of the criminal justice system. I understand that this can apply to, you know, other parts of people's lives. What are other examples of ways poor AI code could impact somebody's daily life? BUSH: It can affect you and determine where you live, whether you get a loan for a home, your FICO score, your scores. It can determine a lot of different things as far as how your health care is provided. And in terms of the criminal justice system, some of the systems are determining whether people are allowed parole based on artificial intelligence and trying to remove the human that is in the loop. SNELL: Now, is this a situation of overt bias or racism, or is this unconscious bias, ways that people don't know that they are setting up a system to not properly serve all of the people who may be using it? BUSH: This is a system of unconscious bias when you don't have diversity, when you don't have people in the room to say, well, let's step back on this data, because what's happening is people are using historical data to solve current problems. SNELL: So can you explain a little bit more about why historical data in particular would be a problem? BUSH: Because the historical data doesn't necessarily represent what's happening in the world right now. Where are you getting this data from? Have you cleaned the data? Have you looked at the data to see if it reflects current trends? Was there diversity when you first collected the data, or is this based on your own bias? SNELL: Is this a problem of big tech companies not being welcoming to Black engineers? BUSH: It is. If the pandemic has taught us anything, companies are going to have to pivot and reimagine their company culture and what it takes to create a world where everyone feels welcome. And that's one of the things that Black Women in A. I. is definitely looking to do. SNELL: So you're talking about diversifying AI engineers. It seems like that's just one step that could target the issues surrounding this entire ecosystem. But it's also not an all-encompassing solution. Should we be reconsidering how AI is used in systems like the criminal justice system or even just in more innocuous ways in our lives? BUSH: Yes, exactly. I think what we have to do is take a step back. Unfortunately, we can't put everything back in the box, but we have to look at governance. It's very important that the government - the U.

But cybercriminals don't only live in Russia. Allan Liska tracks ransomware for the cybersecurity firm Recorded Future.

S. officials continue to warn that a Russian full-scale invasion of Ukraine could happen at any time. Yet, the assault in cyberspace may have already begun. NPR cybersecurity correspondent Jenna McLaughlin joins us for more. Hi, Jenna. JENNA MCLAUGHLIN, BYLINE: Hi, Leila. FADEL: So Jenna, what happened in Ukraine this week? MCLAUGHLIN: So a lot. But in cyberspace, Ukrainian officials have been responding to what's called a denial of service attack. Normally, websites and applications anticipate a certain number of real people logging on. But in this attack, hackers flood the servers with a massive amount of fake traffic. And without protections in place, that knocks the services offline. In this case, hackers targeted multiple government websites, as well as two state banks. Ukrainians were unable to load those sites or log into their online banking portal, though ATMs and bank cards were working. At the same time, the Ukrainian cyber-police said that some people received false text messages, saying that ATMs were down. So services have been restored as of right now. But cyber-experts remain concerned that this attack could be Russian hackers slowly ramping up the pressure against the Ukrainian people. FADEL: So this seemed clearly aimed at disrupting things, causing panic. But, Jenna, is there any evidence that Russia was actually behind this? MCLAUGHLIN: That's a good question. Within hours, Ukrainian officials came out with a statement. They said that it's difficult to trace where these kinds of attacks are coming from, which was something that my cybersecurity experts agreed with. FADEL: Right. MCLAUGHLIN: However, they believe only Russia would have an interest in doing this kind of damage to Ukraine, particularly right now. FADEL: OK. But you've mentioned everything's back to normal. How big of a deal were these hacker attacks? What was the goal if it was indeed the Russians? MCLAUGHLIN: Good question. There's been, actually, a big debate on this. Ukrainian officials said this is the biggest of this kind of cyberattack that they've experienced. And, look; there have been others, including Russian hackers shutting off the lights by hitting the energy grids. Things are back to normal. And denial of service attacks are not the most technically sophisticated. But if Russia was able to convince people that they might lose access to their money, especially as they're worried about an invasion, that has a real psychological impact. FADEL: Yeah. MCLAUGHLIN: I spoke to Olena Prokopenko. She works on U. S. -Ukraine relations at the think tank the German Marshall Fund. Here's how she described it. OLENA PROKOPENKO: The goal here was, apparently, to create distrust to government authorities and force customers to overload banking systems by checking and cashing their accounts. MCLAUGHLIN: But she says that actually wasn't totally successful. There hasn't been a run on the banks. Even so, it's really about the cumulative effect here, the layers of tension, she says. PROKOPENKO: I must admit that the attack certainly caused a sense of insecurity among the Ukrainian public because with the growing magnitude of each new attack, it is really hard to predict which one of them will actually be fatal. MCLAUGHLIN: Even so, she and her whole family plan on staying in Kyiv, their hometown. FADEL: Not an easy decision. So Jenna, what does this all mean heading into the weekend? MCLAUGHLIN: So contrary to what Putin says, Russian troops have not retreated. They've actually multiplied, according to U. S. officials. While the cyberthreat preoccupied Ukrainians for a couple of hours this week and we could see much worse, including damage to critical infrastructure, it's important to keep in mind that a lot of ordinary Ukrainians could die if Russia chooses to start this war. Olena Prokopenko, the expert I talked to, said she's genuinely terrified right now. FADEL: Thank you for your reporting. That was NPR cybersecurity correspondent Jenna McLaughlin. Thank you.

The acquisition comes at a time when more and more workers in the video game industry are speaking out about workplace issues - long hours, low pay, sexual harassment and more. Some of the loudest voices have come from workers at Activision Blizzard, and a small group of them hope to form a union to protect themselves from these issues. But as NPR's Andrew Limbong reports, they are facing a high hurdle. ANDREW LIMBONG, BYLINE: Even in the best of cases, QA testing in games - that is quality assurance - is long and tedious work. JESSICA GONZALEZ: Because you're doing the same thing repetitively to try to produce different results. LIMBONG: That's Jessica Gonzalez, former senior test analyst at Blizzard Entertainment, a subsidiary of the company. She says as a QA tester, you're looking at every nook and cranny of the game to make sure nothing's broken. And you're often up against tight deadlines, which means pulling in lots of overtime at the last minute. GONZALEZ: We're essentially working 24 hours on the clock to get it out. LIMBONG: And that's not even getting at some of the workplace issues specific to Activision Blizzard. Over the summer, the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing sued the company, alleging the workplace was discriminatory towards women and that sexual harassment was rampant in the company. CEO Bobby Kotick has repeatedly drawn criticism for his handling of sexual misconduct there. Then, the company laid off a number of QA testers at Raven Software, another Activision Blizzard subsidiary that works on games such as Call of Duty. Here's Erin Hall, QA tester at Raven. ERIN HALL: There's been a lot of things happening with the company on a corporate level that just doesn't sit right with a lot of us. LIMBONG: So in January, Hall and some 30 of her fellow QA testers at Raven announced they'd be joining a union with the Communication Workers of America, or CWA. In a statement, Raven Software studio head Brian Raffel said the company reviewed and considered CWA's initial request and couldn't find a mutually acceptable solution. Now the workers are petitioning the National Labor Relations Board for a vote. TOM KOCHAN: Workers at large companies have a very difficult time achieving collective bargaining status. LIMBONG: That's Tom Kochan from the MIT Sloan School of Management. He says Activision Blizzard's got the same tools as other big companies at their disposal. They can make big speeches to the staff and hire anti-union consultants. And then there's the question of who is unionizing. Kochan says if the QA testers at Raven want to narrow the vote to just them instead of every game developer at Activision Blizzard, then they'll need to show that they are a unique and separate group of skilled workers. Historically, that's done through apprenticeship programs or professional credentials. KOCHAN: And the NLRB, the National Labor Relations Board, tends to honor those traditions. That tradition hasn't been developed yet in the larger gaming industry. LIMBONG: And then there's the oncoming $68 billion Microsoft acquisition deal hanging overhead. If that goes through. . . KOCHAN: And then you have an even more giant management ladder to climb to gain recognition. LIMBONG: Jessica Gonzalez is clear-eyed about the uphill fight the QA workers face at Activision Blizzard. GONZALEZ: They're going to try to do the legal minimum required and either try to exhaust the efforts or bully everyone out of the company because it's cheaper. It's cheaper than paying everyone better. LIMBONG: Gonzalez herself left the company in December, she says because of the harassment she encountered. And she's now helping the workers organize from outside the company. The NLRB just started their hearing on the case, but it could take weeks, months even, to hear if an election will even be allowed. Andrew Limbong, NPR News.

Then, the company laid off a number of QA testers at Raven Software, another Activision Blizzard subsidiary that works on games such as Call of Duty. Here's Erin Hall, QA tester at Raven. ERIN HALL: There's been a lot of things happening with the company on a corporate level that just doesn't sit right with a lot of us. LIMBONG: So in January, Hall and some 30 of her fellow QA testers at Raven announced they'd be joining a union with the Communication Workers of America, or CWA. In a statement, Raven Software studio head Brian Raffel said the company reviewed and considered CWA's initial request and couldn't find a mutually acceptable solution. Now the workers are petitioning the National Labor Relations Board for a vote. TOM KOCHAN: Workers at large companies have a very difficult time achieving collective bargaining status. LIMBONG: That's Tom Kochan from the MIT Sloan School of Management. He says Activision Blizzard's got the same tools as other big companies at their disposal. They can make big speeches to the staff and hire anti-union consultants. And then there's the question of who is unionizing. Kochan says if the QA testers at Raven want to narrow the vote to just them instead of every game developer at Activision Blizzard, then they'll need to show that they are a unique and separate group of skilled workers. Historically, that's done through apprenticeship programs or professional credentials. KOCHAN: And the NLRB, the National Labor Relations Board, tends to honor those traditions. That tradition hasn't been developed yet in the larger gaming industry. LIMBONG: And then there's the oncoming $68 billion Microsoft acquisition deal hanging overhead. If that goes through. . . KOCHAN: And then you have an even more giant management ladder to climb to gain recognition. LIMBONG: Jessica Gonzalez is clear-eyed about the uphill fight the QA workers face at Activision Blizzard. GONZALEZ: They're going to try to do the legal minimum required and either try to exhaust the efforts or bully everyone out of the company because it's cheaper. It's cheaper than paying everyone better. LIMBONG: Gonzalez herself left the company in December, she says because of the harassment she encountered. And she's now helping the workers organize from outside the company. The NLRB just started their hearing on the case, but it could take weeks, months even, to hear if an election will even be allowed. Andrew Limbong, NPR News.

And one of the truest, deepest forms of rest comes to some animals every winter. MATTEO CERRI: When we talk about hibernation, what we really mean is to do what squirrels or bears or hamster, bats - that all these animals do in winter when they don't have enough resources, enough food or water. ZOMORODI: Matteo Cerri is a professor at the University of Bologna, where he studies hibernation. CERRI: They change what they need from the environment by entering this very, very special state. So it's a bit more like a standby on a TV screen or on a computer. ZOMORODI: And to put their body on standby, Matteo says that animals first have to find the right spot. CERRI: So what you're looking for is a place where you could be safe from predators, potentially invisible to the rest of the environment - where you can just wait, a place where you can be cozy and safe. ZOMORODI: Then the body, heart, lungs, brain slow down to a creep. And there's a word for it. CERRI: Yes. We call that torpor. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)CERRI: So torpor is the technical word that refers to a low metabolic state. And sometime I say to my students, it's like a metabolic austerity. You don't spend anything more than what is strictly needed to exist. You could think of hibernation - or torpor, more correctly, as the natural state that may be the closer to death without actually, you know, going over. ZOMORODI: OK. So those are the basics of hibernation. But here's the thing about Matteo. CERRI: I'm actually working on - try to replicate or simulate hibernation for human use. ZOMORODI: Yeah, human hibernation. Matteo is studying whether it would be possible to put people into this extreme state of torpor. CERRI: I will say, there is a clear path to try to reach this goal. ZOMORODI: OK. Matteo, I understand why animals would hibernate. But you think that there are reasons why humans would want to hibernate? CERRI: That's absolutely what we're thinking is a basket full of resources for medicine, for space travel. And it could really exploit a different state of the body, a different physiology that we are starting now to unraveling and understanding in deeper detail, and could lead to, potentially, disruptive application. I know disruptive is a hype word. ZOMORODI: (Laughter). CERRI: And maybe it's counterproductive to say it. But I really think it will be disruptive. ZOMORODI: Well, yeah, it definitely sounds disruptive. But - OK, so let's start with space travel. You are working with the European Space Agency on this problem, figuring out how astronauts could travel years - even decades - into deep space, which would be really hard on the human body. CERRI: Yeah. Having a trip that lasts, let's say, a decade in space, you have to imagine yourself - you are in a very confined space, night and day, every time, every minute, every hour. So that is pretty stressful. And then there are other problem. Your strength, the structure of your body - some muscle will become weak because of the lack of gravity, and as well for your bone. If they will not be able to keep you standing against the gravity of another planet, how are you going to stand or walk? Then there is the problem of radiation. So the amount of radiation you would get for this kind of trip, there's just too much, unless we find some way to reduce this damage or protect ourselves from the damage. ZOMORODI: OK. So that's a lot of problems. But you think hibernation could do that, could work as protection? CERRI: That's absolutely right. First thing, obviously, you don't need that much food and water and resources when you're hibernating. And you don't produce much biological waste as well. So all of that is cleaner. Your muscle and your bone will probably preserve much of their structure and their strength. And finally, hibernation gives cell an interesting defense against radiation. It doesn't reduce, apparently, the damage radiation do to tissues. But he help tissue repair those damage in a much better way than if we were not hibernating. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ZOMORODI: Wow. That is fascinating. But I don't think that many of us have plans to travel to Mars anytime soon. CERRI: (Laughter). ZOMORODI: I will say, though, you are making me fantasize about going into hibernation for my next long-haul flight. Is that possible? Could we, maybe, one day, put ourselves into a state of hibernation and wake up in a different time zone feeling pretty good? CERRI: That would be great. That would be fantastic. I hate long flights. So - I had a friend. He's, like, a trader in the stock market. He was asking me, could we go into torpor when the market goes down. . . ZOMORODI: (Laughter). CERRI: . . . And wake up when the market goes up? So it will all depend on how easy and risky the technology would be. But why put a limit to our hope? ZOMORODI: When we come back, we get a little more grounded - how hibernation could be used more immediately in medical treatments. On the show today, rest. I'm Manoush Zomorodi. And you're listening to the TED Radio Hour from NPR. Stay with us. It's the TED Radio Hour from NPR. I'm Manoush Zomorodi, and we were just talking to hibernation expert Matteo Cerri. Matteo says there are a few intriguing stories that make researchers believe humans can hibernate or be put into a state of torpor, including a story published in 1800 about an entire village in Russia that would sleep through the winter. CERRI: There is a Russian term for this winter sleep. It's called lotska. I don't know if I pronounce it correctly. And apparently, those peasants and villagers were gathering together in this large house in the center of the town to sleep the winter off together - just sleeping there, waiting for spring to come. ZOMORODI: I mean, that's - whether it's true or not, that is a beautiful story. It's like a fairy tale. But there is a famous story from the neurologist Oliver Sacks about a man that he called Uncle Toby, right? CERRI: Yes, definitely. Oliver Sacks - he was visiting a family for - you know, on-site for some other question. And he noticed this person, like - he said, like, icy frozen - still alive though - with temperature - body temperature of 69 Fahrenheit. So about 20 Celsius. ZOMORODI: Yikes. Cold. CERRI: Yes - and ask what happen to him. And they say, well, this is Uncle Toby. And seven years ago, he just stopped. He lives with us. We take care of him. We feed him, we shave him, we dress him, but he just stands there. So he suspected hyperthyroidism as a possible cause of this strange behavior and proposed to treat him with thyroid hormone - at the time was available. And the family agree, and Uncle Toby actually - he woke up. So he was given a drug and he wake up, and he doesn't remember the seven years that were passed. But then - and that would be a good ending story. But the story actually is not - it's sad in its end, because Uncle Toby had cancer - small cell lung cancer - and the cancer woke up with him. And then it killed him in a few months. ZOMORODI: So does that mean that when Uncle Toby was in this sort of stupor that maybe - not only did he go to sleep, but maybe the cancer went to sleep during that time? CERRI: Yes, that is exactly the point. The idea is that the cancer in Uncle Toby had found a way to leave both. So a provocative hypothesis would be that the cancer actually produced something that unlocked the ability of the brain to enter torpor. And then therefore the body entered torpor, and therefore the cancer stopped growing because that what happened in torpor. The cancer usually stopped growing. And they both stay that way. And once we awake Uncle Toby, we also wake the cancer, and the story ends. ZOMORODI: So when we hear that story, does it tell us something about the way that putting humans into hibernation or torpor might be used when it comes to treating something as aggressive and active as mutations in cells, cancer? CERRI: It could be. It could be used for this kind of clinical condition. Even more pressing would be for someone waiting for an organ transplant. There are about 50 people pretty much every day between the - within Europe and the United States die because of lack of organ. So if you could suspend them, you know, slowing their down metabolism down, then you increase their chances to potentially find an organ. But in the case of Uncle Toby's story, the important part for us is that there seems to be a way in which the brain can be made - induce hibernation, can be reactivating this old state, even in humans. And so it would be feasible. That's what we hope for. ZOMORODI: I mean, do you imagine wings of hospitals filled with patients who are resting in a state of torpor, waiting for their cancer treatment or waiting for an organ transplant? Is that something that might happen? CERRI: Yes. Yes, that's what I envision. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ZOMORODI: So how would we do this? Whether, you know, it is for space travel or for medicine or any number of purposes, like, how would you put people into this state of hibernation? CERRI: So, so far, the greatest results were to induce into a state that very much resemble hibernation animal that are not able to enter hibernation or torpor. And we call - I call, personally - this state synthetic torpor. ZOMORODI: Oh, so you induce this in animals in the lab. CERRI: Yes. And we were able to do it by silencing the activity of a little group of neurons in the very old part of our brain. In the past 10 years, there have been amazing discovery in the field. We have now a better idea of the brain network that control torpor. We have uncover other hotspot that could be target for inducing torpor. So a lot of exciting thing happen in the - really, in the last 10 years. ZOMORODI: So can we talk about waking up? What it - I had the pleasure of having a routine procedure earlier this week where I was put under general anesthesia, and it is just the weirdest thing coming out of it. You're like, wait, where was I for (laughter) the last half hour? What would waking up from this state of torpor hibernation be like? CERRI: It's the most dangerous part, I would say, of hibernation. And. . . ZOMORODI: Oh. CERRI: . . . And there is really little that we know about how this animal wakes up. The Arctic ground squirrel, his brain is at minus 1 Celsius. How is this brain able to bring the body back to normal? And that's still quite unknown. But what we see is definitely for, especially for the brain, is the most plastic state I've ever seen as a neurophysiologist. So synapses get form and reform is a neuro storm (ph) of molecules, of active brain molecules. So it could be something about, like, dreaming or it could provide you sensation of dreamlike state, my guess. Maybe is even pleasurable - we don't know - or maybe not. But after you wake up, I would say you will also be very, very sleepy. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)CERRI: You need to sleep after hibernation. The reason why - still mystery. Like, the entire time you spent in torpor was sleep deprivation. ZOMORODI: So you need to rest after your big rest. CERRI: Oh, yeah. It's hard to tell that hibernation is rest. It's suspension. You are retiring from the game of life for a little bit of time. ZOMORODI: That's neurophysiologist and hibernation researcher Matteo Cerri. If you speak Italian, you can watch his TED Talk at ted. com. MANOUSH ZOMORODI, HOST:   On the show today, rest. And one of the truest, deepest forms of rest comes to some animals every winter.

This month, the FBI issued a warning about the rise in a type of mobile phone scam called SIM swapping, saying it cost consumers more than $68 million in losses just last year. And according to the FBI's figures, it's 15 times more likely to happen to you today than it was just a couple of years ago. So what is SIM swapping, and how can you protect yourself? We called Eva Velasquez for help with this. She is the president and chief executive officer at the Identity Theft Resource Center. That's a non-profit whose goal is to help consumers reduce their risk of falling victim to identity theft. And she's with us now. Eva Velasquez, thanks so much for joining us. EVA VELASQUEZ: I'm so happy to be here, and I'm glad we're covering this really important topic. MARTIN: Well, first of all, could you just explain just what is it? I mean, how are scammers stealing our information from the SIM cards in our smartphones? MARTIN: Well, it is somewhat complex. And just to level set here, your SIM card is that tiny little microchip in your phone and it tells your phone what number it responds to. And there's lots of information in it, but it's transferable to another phone, and that's how you can upgrade or buy another phone if yours is damaged and still keep your phone number, your photos, you know, your music. But much like phone number porting, SIM porting is - it's really easy to do if someone other than you can convince a cellular employee to help them do it. MARTIN: So this is a scam directed at employees of mobile carrier companies? Or is this a conspiracy in which they're involved? VELASQUEZ: Well, you know, it could be both. We often don't know if it is an insider threat where an employee is involved, but sometimes it's just an employee trying to provide good customer service and they're being socially engineered. So we tend to look at the employees more as an instrument of the scam rather than the perpetrators. MARTIN: So the FBI says these SIM swap scammers netted more than $68 million in 2021, which was up from just about $4 million in 2020. How did this get to be so successful and how did they get all that money? Like what did they do? VELASQUEZ: Well, if we step back and just look at the entire fraud landscape and ecosystem, people should understand that we have had unprecedented rates of fraud across the board in all of our systems, basically, since the pandemic started. There were just a lot of new opportunities. There was a lot more money in our systems and a lot more vulnerabilities were exposed. So it doesn't surprise me at all that we saw a dramatic rise in this type of fraud because frankly, we saw a dramatic rise in all types of fraud, particularly identity crimes, over the last two years, and we're going to continue to see this sort of new baseline. It hasn't gone down. A lot of folks think that, OK, the pandemic is, I won't say over, but we're coming to the end of it and so the fraud has waned. And while we aren't at the peak numbers that we were seeing in 2020 and 2021, we have a new very high baseline and there's going to be a very long tail on this fraud. Unfortunately, consumers are the ones that are going to have to deal with this at the end of the day. MARTIN: How do you deal with this? And I think first, since you've identified employees of mobile carrier companies as being kind of the - forgive me for using this language - the weak link here. How are the wireless carriers doing anything to address this? And then of course, I'm going to ask you, is there anything that consumers can do themselves? VELASQUEZ: Well, the reality is, of course, the wireless carriers are implementing processes, just like many of our institutions are implementing additional anti-fraud processes. They don't want to be losing these dollars and they don't want unhappy customers, either. I mean, that goes without saying. But the particularly insidious part of the SIM swapping threat is that it's - there's little that an individual can do proactively on that - for that particular issue. It's about detection and it's about acting very quickly. So we really encourage people, if anything appears to be amiss and their phone stops working, sometimes people won't notice right away because they're at home and their phone is connected to their Wi-Fi network, and they don't realize that they don't have that access to that cellular account until they're no longer connected to Wi-Fi. But we do encourage people, if you see any strange activity to take it seriously. And frankly, this goes across the board. You know, it doesn't matter if it's a weird charge on your credit card statement, a notification from a company that you do business with, any of those indicators, please follow up immediately because it may be indicative of a bigger problem. MARTIN: And how do you follow up? VELASQUEZ: You will have to follow up directly with your mobile carrier. And where that creates a challenge is, often people cannot get back into their account, so sometimes they cannot do this digitally. They actually will have to go into a store front and have that conversation. MARTIN: That was Eva Velasquez, president and CEO of the Identity Theft Resource Center. That's a nonprofit whose goal is to help consumers reduce their risk of falling victim to identity theft. Eva Velasquez, thanks so much for joining us and sharing this expertise with us.

DAVID HUNT: You fill out a team of seven mushers using your available cash. And that forces you to get a couple good ones, get a few in the middle of the pack, get some rookies and then try to pick that red lantern. SIMON: The red lantern is the person who comes in last, so don't blame the dogs. The voice you just heard is that of David Hunt, who manages the site. He's what you'd call a mushing fan, even though he's never seen Alaska outside of a postcard or video screen. HUNT: I live here close to Paris, Texas, and got introduced to mushing, actually, in the fourth grade. SIMON: That's the year his teacher wrote the bib numbers for Iditarod mushers on pieces of paper. HUNT: So we were drawn a musher and got to follow it that year through the race - and got hooked. SIMON: David Hunt is now 33, and he's found a way to mush with his own dogs down in Texas. HUNT: Normally, I run them on my bicycle or, you know, a cart or something. SIMON: But while David Hunt lives far from the course of the Iditarod, his partner in Fantasy Mushing is much closer. DANNY SEAVEY: My name is Danny Seavey. I live in Seward, Alaska, and I'm a third-generation dog musher. SIMON: The Seavey family is a sled dog racing dynasty. His grandfather, Dan Sr. , competed in the very first Iditarod race in 1973. His father, Mitch, won the race three times, and his brother Dallas has won five times. SEAVEY: I'm not quite as crazy as my dad and brother. But I have run the Iditarod three times, and I love running dogs. SIMON: David Hunt and Danny Seavey would like to interest fans in all the mushers, not just the top finishers. Danny Seavey says. . . SEAVEY: We started the fantasy concept sort of as a way to drive interest in everybody else, the guys who are racing not to win, or they were just trying to make it and so forth. SIMON: The price for each musher is based on a number of factors, including popularity and previous performance. You cannot afford for all of your seven picks to be top mushers, so you need to select some lesser-known ones and rookies. SEAVEY: Which to do so well involves having to go to that team's Facebook or social media pages or blogs and try to do a little bit of research. SIMON: Hunt and Seavey say that people from all over the world participate, including school classes. Their site allows you to put together small groups to compete against people you know. SEAVEY: I know a lot of the people that play use it as a basis for their own friendly office pools or bets sort of like a March Madness bracket. SIMON: The site hosts fantasy competitions for seven races across Alaska, Minnesota and Norway. The Iditarod is the most popular. Hunt says participation in that fantasy race has grown substantially since 2017, when it was around 1,500. HUNT: Last year, we had 2,900 and some, almost 3,000. SIMON: Seavey believes people who fantasy mush are fascinated about the rugged setting and harsh, challenging conditions of sled dog racing, and they want every dog and musher to do well. SEAVEY: The fans are rooting for everybody. They just want everybody to succeed. SIMON: David Hunt hopes to make it up to Alaska to see a race in person one day.

If so, you might have been thinking about Apple AirTags. Those are tiny tracking devices about the size of a quarter. They're being marketed as a way to help keep track of things like keys or kids' backpacks. But now there's growing concern that they're being used to track people without their knowledge. This past Wednesday, New York Attorney General Letitia James issued a consumer alert about these devices, warning New Yorkers to be aware of potentially malicious uses like stalking. We wanted to learn more about this technology and the privacy concerns surrounding its use, so we've called Eva Galperin. She is the director of Cybersecurity at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. That's a nonprofit that works to defend civil liberties in the digital age. And she is with us now. Eva Galperin, welcome. Thank you so much for joining us. EVA GALPERIN: Hi. Thanks for having me. MARTIN: So before we jump in, could you just explain how these Apple AirTags work for people who might never have seen them? As I said that they're shaped like a coin, but what exactly do they do, and how do they work? GALPERIN: It pairs over Bluetooth to your phone, and then you attach it to whatever item it is that you don't want to lose. When you have misplaced the item, you can go to your phone, and it will tell you where that item is located using Find My. The way in which AirTags are different from the other physical trackers is that the physical trackers usually depend on a network of other phones that have the app installed on the phone. And what Apple did was, essentially, they decided to use the entire network of devices with Find My installed on them, which is nearly every iPhone that exists. MARTIN: So the idea is that this would be your device that you would use for yourself. And what I think I hear you saying is that because the way this product is designed, that you could apply an AirTag to somebody who is not you and then they would never know. GALPERIN: You can. And this was a concern the moment the product came out. And in response to these concerns, Apple did include some anti-stalking mitigations. For example, if the AirTag was - when the AirTag first came out - out of range of the phone that it's paired to for 36 hours, it would start to emit a beep. That beep is about 60 decibels, which is about as loud as your dishwasher. And you still get, you know, 36 hours of free stalking, which seems like a little much. That's pretty invasive. MARTIN: So Apple recently released a statement about AirTag and unwanted tracking. In that statement, they said that they have been, quote, \"actively working with law enforcement on all AirTag-related requests,\" unquote. You've shared with us that there have been some improvements, but they're not - in your opinion, they're not enough. What else should they be doing, and can they do those things? GALPERIN: Well, in December, Apple came out with an app that you can install on your Android that would allow you to know whether or not you were being tracked by an AirTag. But that app does not work the same way as the iPhone capabilities. You have to proactively download an app, and you have to proactively run a scan. And that is a much higher barrier to entry than just having everything running automatically in the background on your phone. MARTIN: At its core, this is a privacy issue. And this certainly isn't the first time, as you just said, that privacy concerns were raised with the new technology. The conflict seems to often boil down to the fact that lawmakers are slow to regulate fast-developing technologies. Is there a way that you think policymakers should be thinking about addressing privacy before something bad happens, before something - because what I'm hearing you say is that this could have been anticipated, that somebody would - that people - that all technologies have positive benefits, and they all have malicious uses. So is there a way that they could think about this or that they should be thinking about these strategies before something terrible happens? GALPERIN: Oh, absolutely. And I think that that - those are decisions that need to be made not necessarily on the legislative and policy level, but that should be being made inside of the company and that really need to come as a result of a change in the culture. I think that part of the reason why the AirTag came out the way that it did was because of a blind spot among Apple developers of trying to imagine a person who doesn't own Apple products. In the case of, you know, what should we be doing. . . MARTIN: Can I just ask you one more thing, Eva? Excuse me. Could it also be that there's - that gender plays a role here. . . GALPERIN: Oh, absolutely. MARTIN: . . . That perhaps developers did not occur to them that this would be a particular concern for women? GALPERIN: I think that it did occur to them to include some anti-stalking mitigations, but I think that if there had been more women involved in this process that the anti-stalking mitigations would have been more robust and that concerns about stalking would have been front and center, rather than sort of a tacked-on afterthought to the initial product. MARTIN: In the consumer alert, Attorney General Letitia James recommended that consumers listen for unfamiliar beeping and to watch for the Item Detected Near You notification on their iPhones. Are there any other steps that you would recommend that people could take to protect themselves and their things, you know, from unwanted tracking? GALPERIN: Yes. For one thing, I wouldn't count on the beep. The beep is really easy to muffle or disable. But what I would do is, if I don't own an iPhone, I would download Apple's detection app for Android. And I would proactively run scans regularly if I was concerned about being followed by an AirTag. MARTIN: Is there something that law enforcement could be doing about this? GALPERIN: One of the big problems that we have now, not just with AirTags, but with software which is covertly installed on people's devices and then used for tracking, is that sometimes the police simply don't have the training. They don't know what they're looking at. They don't understand how the stalking works. And they will tell people, well, this requires a full forensic analysis that will require us to, you know, seize all of your devices. Or even worse, they will simply say, you're not being tracked. You're imagining things. They will gaslight the victim. And so one of the things that I've been working on is I've been working with Senator (ph) Barbara Lee on a police training bill in the state of Maryland, and it's in the state Senate right now. And it proposes that police at the police academy should receive training on how tech-enabled stalking works and how to recognize it. MARTIN: Oftentimes when people - when privacy advocates raise these things, a lot of sort of regular users think, oh, they're just being extra, and then everybody else catches up. Are there some things that you routinely do that you could recommend to us? GALPERIN: The advice that works for me is not necessarily the advice that works for most ordinary people. I don't run around telling everybody that they need to be worried about everything all the time because that's a really good way to get everybody to just ignore your advice or to drive themselves crazy. I think that people need to have a clear-eyed view of what they're trying to protect and who they're trying to protect it from and to do only the steps that get them that protection because trying to protect everything from everyone all the time is just unfeasible and exhausting. MARTIN: That's Eva Galperin, director of cybersecurity for the Electronic Frontier Foundation. Eva Galperin, thanks so much for being here and sharing this expertise with us.

Is there a way that you think policymakers should be thinking about addressing privacy before something bad happens, before something - because what I'm hearing you say is that this could have been anticipated, that somebody would - that people - that all technologies have positive benefits, and they all have malicious uses. So is there a way that they could think about this or that they should be thinking about these strategies before something terrible happens? GALPERIN: Oh, absolutely. And I think that that - those are decisions that need to be made not necessarily on the legislative and policy level, but that should be being made inside of the company and that really need to come as a result of a change in the culture. I think that part of the reason why the AirTag came out the way that it did was because of a blind spot among Apple developers of trying to imagine a person who doesn't own Apple products. In the case of, you know, what should we be doing. . . MARTIN: Can I just ask you one more thing, Eva? Excuse me. Could it also be that there's - that gender plays a role here. . . GALPERIN: Oh, absolutely. MARTIN: . . . That perhaps developers did not occur to them that this would be a particular concern for women? GALPERIN: I think that it did occur to them to include some anti-stalking mitigations, but I think that if there had been more women involved in this process that the anti-stalking mitigations would have been more robust and that concerns about stalking would have been front and center, rather than sort of a tacked-on afterthought to the initial product. MARTIN: In the consumer alert, Attorney General Letitia James recommended that consumers listen for unfamiliar beeping and to watch for the Item Detected Near You notification on their iPhones. Are there any other steps that you would recommend that people could take to protect themselves and their things, you know, from unwanted tracking? GALPERIN: Yes. For one thing, I wouldn't count on the beep. The beep is really easy to muffle or disable. But what I would do is, if I don't own an iPhone, I would download Apple's detection app for Android. And I would proactively run scans regularly if I was concerned about being followed by an AirTag. MARTIN: Is there something that law enforcement could be doing about this? GALPERIN: One of the big problems that we have now, not just with AirTags, but with software which is covertly installed on people's devices and then used for tracking, is that sometimes the police simply don't have the training. They don't know what they're looking at. They don't understand how the stalking works. And they will tell people, well, this requires a full forensic analysis that will require us to, you know, seize all of your devices. Or even worse, they will simply say, you're not being tracked. You're imagining things. They will gaslight the victim. And so one of the things that I've been working on is I've been working with Senator (ph) Barbara Lee on a police training bill in the state of Maryland, and it's in the state Senate right now. And it proposes that police at the police academy should receive training on how tech-enabled stalking works and how to recognize it. MARTIN: Oftentimes when people - when privacy advocates raise these things, a lot of sort of regular users think, oh, they're just being extra, and then everybody else catches up. Are there some things that you routinely do that you could recommend to us? GALPERIN: The advice that works for me is not necessarily the advice that works for most ordinary people. I don't run around telling everybody that they need to be worried about everything all the time because that's a really good way to get everybody to just ignore your advice or to drive themselves crazy. I think that people need to have a clear-eyed view of what they're trying to protect and who they're trying to protect it from and to do only the steps that get them that protection because trying to protect everything from everyone all the time is just unfeasible and exhausting. MARTIN: That's Eva Galperin, director of cybersecurity for the Electronic Frontier Foundation. Eva Galperin, thanks so much for being here and sharing this expertise with us.

He then vowed to create his own platform. He calls it Truth Social. And it launched yesterday. I talked earlier with NPR tech reporter Bobby Allyn about it. BOBBY ALLYN, BYLINE: So there was tons of interest. The app was released Monday morning and quickly shot to the top of Apple's most downloaded list. But many people, myself included, who tried to check it out were stuck in a kind of tech doom loop. You know, there were these email confirmations that were promised and never arrived. You'd put in a code and get an error message. This was widely reported across Twitter and other social media. Those who were able to make accounts were placed on a wait list, with some hundreds of thousands of people in front of them. MARTIN: Bless you for doing that for the sake of journalism, Bobby. ALLYN: (Laughter). MARTIN: So just remind us the larger context here. Twitter, of course, banned Trump. But say more about his agenda with this app. ALLYN: Yeah. Exactly. So you know, since he was banned from Twitter, Facebook and YouTube after statements he made urging supporters to storm the Capitol, you know, he has wanted to start his own Twitter-esque service. And he's enlisted former Congressman Devin Nunes to lead the effort. Nunes recently went on Fox News to talk up Truth Social. He says all the bugs will be worked out by the end of March and that it's all about, you know, giving people their voice back and creating a social media platform that's not controlled by a big Silicon Valley company. And let me remind you, this is a really crowded space, Rachel. There's, like, half a dozen other conservative-leading, you know, social media apps trying to pull people away from the Twitters and Facebooks of the world. MARTIN: Right. So he has competition. Even Donald Trump has competition in that space. So does this app, then - with Trump's name attached to it, does it have any kind of shot of breaking through? ALLYN: Certainly has a very powerful publicity machine. I mean, Trump allies, like representatives Marjorie Taylor Greene and Matt Gaetz, are talking it up, so is Fox News star Sean Hannity. It has raised hundreds of millions of dollars. So given these big names and its sizable fundraising, you know, it does have potential. But experts I talked to are pretty doubtful that it will ever come anywhere close to replacing Twitter. Here's Hunter College professor Jessie Daniels, who studies online extremism. JESSIE DANIELS: I think part of what he has found so valuable, especially about Twitter, is that it both is relied upon by journalists as a source, and it's used by a real cross section of people politically. And so Twitter becomes a kind of target-rich environment. ALLYN: In other words, Truth Social might not be that, right? Twitter has some 300 million users and lots of different views, lots of viral squabbles. And if a platform is mostly like-minded people, you know, basically an echo chamber, you might not have those fights that make Twitter create so many headlines. MARTIN: Although, it can serve to animate his base, couldn't it? ALLYN: That's true. No, that is very true. you know? But, you know, there's also only so many people interested in a non-mainstream alternative to Twitter. MARTIN: Yeah. ALLYN: So it's sort of, you know, are these people really - who are at other sites going to go to Trump's new site? And I will note here, Rachel, that I checked out the app's terms of service. And there is one thing that is prohibited on Truth Social, and that is, quote, to \"disparage, tarnish or otherwise harm\" the backers of the site. And I imagine that means Donald Trump.

NPR's Bobby Allyn takes a closer look at how TikTok is changing views of the conflict. BOBBY ALLYN, BYLINE: Quinn Poseley is a 20-year-old student at the University of Southern California. Lately, when he's been opening TikTok, he's been seeing a lot of videos portraying the war in Ukraine. There's just one problem. Many of them are repurposing old images of different conflicts. QUINN POSELEY: I've seen videos that are from Crimea in like 2014 that are just old, and they're acting like they're happening right now. I've seen photos and stuff that are just straight-up Palestine. ALLYN: On TikTok, people scroll quickly through a feed of videos recommended by the app's algorithm. Posley says if something looks off, he usually just moves past it fast and moves on with life. POSELEY: You're getting, you know, 15 videos in 30 seconds. It's hard to stop and try and think about everything critically. ALLYN: There are no numbers on how widespread Ukraine misinformation is on TikTok. I talked to a dozen other students at USC. We scrolled through the app together, saw plenty of fitness, skateboarding and cooking posts, but only a single video from Ukraine. Still, TikTok researcher Abbie Richards worries about the impression fake war videos are having on young users. ABBIE RICHARDS: They haven't necessarily experienced a geopolitical conflict on this scale, and TikTok is where a lot of people, especially younger people, are going for their news and for their information and for their outlook on the world. ALLYN: She pulls out her phone to offer an example. RICHARDS: You can hear some bombs dropping, the sound of a plane flying over. And the video is a target on like a kind of sniper view. ALLYN: It's hard to tell exactly who uploaded this video. RICHARDS: It's from an account called Ukraine206, and it's simply just hashtagged with Ukraine. ALLYN: In recent days, it's racked up more than 7 million views, but. . . RICHARDS: It's actually footage from a video game. ALLYN: Researchers like Richards have a long list of examples like this - hyper-realistic video game footage, old footage, war movie clips all refashioned on TikTok to appear as if they were just taken in Ukraine. Why are people creating fake Ukraine footage? Richards says there's no simple answer. Sometimes it's to chase views, likes or money. When the war started, researchers found that people were pretending to be doing live TikTok videos from Ukraine and asking for donations. Some were scams. RICHARDS: It's hard to really assign a motive to a lot of the misinformation, but it does seem to be connected oftentimes to grifting. ALLYN: TikTok says it's ramped up efforts to catch misleading war-related videos since the conflict broke out. A TikTok spokeswoman says misinformation that causes harm is removed from the platform. But a lot of these fake videos aren't clearly causing harm, says Ciaran O'Connor. He's with the London-based Institute for Strategic Dialogue. CIARAN O'CONNOR: So much of this kind of content and this kind of activity falls within the gray zone. ALLYN: The way TikTok is designed creates something of a Catch-22 when it comes to trying to fact-check videos. Sam Gregory is with the human rights network Witness. SAM GREGORY: The ways we might encourage someone to verify a video - look at it carefully. Try and work out the location and the source. Maybe go and try and find alternative sources of the app and then return. All of those things are interpreted as attention. ALLYN: Meaning if you linger for a while on, say, a fake video of the war or rewatch it several times, that sends a signal to TikTok that you want more similar content. Now, not all videos on TikTok are duping people. Some Ukrainians have been delivering daily on-the-ground updates. College student Posley says those are the kind of TikTok videos he appreciates. POSELEY: It gives average people in Ukraine and, you know, wherever else the conflict might be happening, gives them an opportunity to project their experiences to the world with no middleman. They can just do it. They can just show people what's happening to them right then and there. ALLYN: But researchers say if most time on TikTok is spent watching fake videos of war, that does little to add to a person's understanding of a conflict. Bobby Allyn, NPR News, Los Angeles.

Facebook, Twitter and Google have taken steps in recent days to curb Russian propaganda and disinformation, but that risks angering Moscow and the possibility that Russia could cut its people off from international social media altogether. NPR tech correspondent Shannon Bond joins us now. Hi, Shannon. SHANNON BOND, BYLINE: Hi, Sacha. PFEIFFER: Would you describe some of the Russian mis-info floating around on social media? BOND: Yeah. I mean, we're seeing Russia and its sympathizers, you know, really using these platforms to push the Kremlin's agenda, you know, casting Ukraine as a failed state and justifying this war. And that's being done through official channels and state-controlled media but also through these tried and true disinformation tactics like networks of fake accounts that are quite familiar, you know, if you think just back to Russia's attempts to influence the 2016 presidential election. PFEIFFER: So particularly because we've been through this once before, what have the tech companies been doing so far? BOND: Well, over the weekend, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube took down a small number of fake accounts that were posing as news outlets, spreading stories aimed at undermining Ukraine and boosting Russia. These were based in Russia and Ukraine. Facebook also uncovered a hacking campaign targeting a handful of high-profile Ukrainians. These were people in the military, public officials, journalists. And the goal here was to use these hacked accounts to spread propaganda against Ukraine, and Facebook said a hacking group that's been connected to Russia's ally, Belarus, was behind this. Now, they say, you know, they caught these efforts early, before many people had seen this propaganda. And it's true that Facebook and other companies have gotten much better at quickly uncovering this kind of manipulation. It's really quite different than in 2016, when they were caught so off guard by Russian interference. PFEIFFER: But Russia can still spread its message through state-sponsored accounts. So how are social media companies responding to that? BOND: Yeah, that's a big issue. I spoke with Nina Jankowicz at the Wilson Center. She's studied Russian information operations for years, and she said what we've seen is that, you know, more of the propaganda is just out in the open now. The Kremlin, you know, is pushing these pretexts for war through its official channels and these state media accounts, and they have big followings on social media. For example, RT's main Facebook page has more than 7 million followers. And these outlets are sources of pro-Kremlin propaganda. You know, they're toeing the Kremlin's line that this is not an invasion of Ukraine but a special operation, framing the conflict as a response to Ukrainian aggression. So Facebook and Google are now blocking some of these state media accounts entirely in Ukraine at the request of the government. And just today, Facebook said it's blocking RT and Sputnik in the EU. And, you know, both companies have also taken away the ability of Russian state media outlets to make money from ads. Over at Twitter, they're putting warning labels on tweets that link to their - these outlet's stories making clear they are from a state-affiliated organization, making it less likely people will see these tweets. That's similar to what they've done with false claims about the 2020 election and COVID. PFEIFFER: How is Russia responding to this tech crackdown? BOND: Well, the Russian government is unhappy. You know, it calls this censorship. And Facebook and Twitter both say their services are being throttled in Russia. And that's the big risk here, Sacha. Just how far can these tech companies go before Russia pulls the plug entirely? They don't want to be kicked out of Russia, of course, for business reasons, but also, these platforms see themselves as a really important way for Russians, you know, everyday Russian citizens to communicate and to get information that is not controlled by the government. So in these decisions, they are walking a very, very fine line. PFEIFFER: Shannon, thank you. BOND: Thank you so much. PFEIFFER: That's NPR's Shannon Bond. And we note that Facebook parent, Meta, pays NPR to license NPR content. SACHA PFEIFFER, HOST:   Social media is also a battlefield in the war in Ukraine.

The Kremlin, you know, is pushing these pretexts for war through its official channels and these state media accounts, and they have big followings on social media. For example, RT's main Facebook page has more than 7 million followers. And these outlets are sources of pro-Kremlin propaganda. You know, they're toeing the Kremlin's line that this is not an invasion of Ukraine but a special operation, framing the conflict as a response to Ukrainian aggression. So Facebook and Google are now blocking some of these state media accounts entirely in Ukraine at the request of the government. And just today, Facebook said it's blocking RT and Sputnik in the EU. And, you know, both companies have also taken away the ability of Russian state media outlets to make money from ads. Over at Twitter, they're putting warning labels on tweets that link to their - these outlet's stories making clear they are from a state-affiliated organization, making it less likely people will see these tweets. That's similar to what they've done with false claims about the 2020 election and COVID. PFEIFFER: How is Russia responding to this tech crackdown? BOND: Well, the Russian government is unhappy. You know, it calls this censorship. And Facebook and Twitter both say their services are being throttled in Russia. And that's the big risk here, Sacha. Just how far can these tech companies go before Russia pulls the plug entirely? They don't want to be kicked out of Russia, of course, for business reasons, but also, these platforms see themselves as a really important way for Russians, you know, everyday Russian citizens to communicate and to get information that is not controlled by the government. So in these decisions, they are walking a very, very fine line. PFEIFFER: Shannon, thank you. BOND: Thank you so much. PFEIFFER: That's NPR's Shannon Bond.

NPR cybersecurity correspondent Jenna McLaughlin reports on how a volunteer Ukrainian cyber army plus hacktivists and cybercriminals are joining the fight. JENNA MCLAUGHLIN, BYLINE: In normal times, Yegor Aushev is a well-known entrepreneur in Ukraine. He studied physics before founding several companies. But on February 24, he started building a makeshift Ukrainian cyber army. YEGOR AUSHEV: So from minus two floor from my parking garage, I started, actually. MCLAUGHLIN: In a concrete parking garage in central Kyiv, as he listened to explosions rock the pre-dawn streets above, he got to work. He reached out to his contacts at the Ministry of Defense. He called trusted friends, posted across social media and drafted a Google sign-up sheet. AUSHEV: OK, I'm collecting the people who want to be volunteers. MCLAUGHLIN: People flocked to answer Aushev. I talked to a Ukrainian tech expert living in Germany who signed up, and I texted with a lawyer who had hoped to enroll in cybersecurity classes in the fall. She pitched her services fighting disinformation in her hometown of Zaporizhzhia. She has been hiding in the basement with her daughter during increasingly destructive Russian attacks. AUSHEV: And more and more bombs were coming to our cities, and I made a call to action for everyone. Like, all hackers who support freedom, please help us to hack Russia. MCLAUGHLIN: To hack Russia - as the attacks escalated, Aushev posted a new call on Facebook offering $100,000 to people who shared information about how to breach Russian systems; like a bug bounty where companies pay people to find mistakes in the code so they can fix them but in reverse. Aushev has also been in touch with some so-called hacktivists who have been supporting Ukraine, including the infamous collective Anonymous, as well as a grassroots resistance group in Belarus called the Cyber-Partisans. YULIANA SHEMETOVETS: Hi, my name is Yuliana, and I am the spokesperson for Cyber-Partisans. So in their recent attack, Cyber-Partisans aimed at the railways. MCLAUGHLIN: These groups have boasted about defacing Russian media sites, about stealing sensitive information on the invading Russian military forces, even breaking into Russian infrastructure. Meanwhile, some ransomware gangs known to cooperate with the Russian government have said they defend the Kremlin. It's complete chaos and, at this point, tough to verify what's real and what isn't. MATT OLNEY: This is insane. MCLAUGHLIN: Matt Olney, the head of threat intelligence at cybersecurity firm Cisco, is really worried about a bunch of amateurs, full of righteous anger, doing real damage, especially to civilians. OLNEY: It's a really dangerous time right now because most of these people don't know what they're doing, and somebody at some point is going to get lucky and hit something important. MCLAUGHLIN: Olney means hitting water or gas - things that civilians need as much as the military. Then it's anyone's bet how Russia reacts. But for many Ukrainians, they can't imagine things becoming much worse. JAANIKA MERILO: How can we escalate even more when someone is actually threatening us with nukes? MCLAUGHLIN: Jaanika Merilo, an adviser to the Ukrainian Ministry of Digital Transformation, is terrified by a nuclear power menacing Ukraine, and she'll welcome anything to help defend her homeland. The Ukrainian government appears to be supporting that position. Different agencies, including the Ukrainian cyber police, have amplified calls for hackers to target Russia, but it's impossible to say what could happen if the conflict in cyberspace really spins out of control. MERILO: It's been like, thank God the communications are not down. MCLAUGHLIN: Russia hasn't shut off communications or power in Ukraine yet, to the surprise of many cyber experts, but that doesn't mean it can't. And Putin has hinted he'll launch cyberattacks beyond Ukraine's borders. Meanwhile, Yegor Aushev, the leader of Ukraine's cyber army, says he doesn't want to start a new trend in guerrilla cyber operations. AUSHEV: I don't want to create some army. I hope it will, like, finish soon. MCLAUGHLIN: What Aushev says he really wants is to get back to normal life. As we spoke, telegram notifications kept sounding. He sighed with fatigue more than once. AUSHEV: This war will stop. It will be stopped so that - together with international partners, we will, like, force this crazy guy to stop this war.

But is it really what's happening on the ground? Take this example. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: (Yelling in non-English language). SIMON: It was shared widely online as a young Ukrainian girl confronting a Russian soldier, and fact-checkers determined the girl was Palestinian. She was yelling at an Israeli soldier in the West Bank 10 years ago. We're now joined by Joan Donovan. She's the research director at the Shorenstein Center of Media, Politics and Public Policy at Harvard. Thanks so much for being with us. JOAN DONOVAN: Pleasure. SIMON: This example we just played, of course, is an old video from another conflict being, to use a word of our times, repurposed for this one. Do we see a lot of that going on? DONOVAN: Yeah. So we see it in different ways. So, of course, there's the repackaging of old media, which we call re-contextualized media, on all platforms. And even the format of a app like TikTok, for instance, it's got a lot of built-in tools that allow for the re-contextualization of images and video and sound, even. And so we have been seeing quite a bit of people just trying to get clicks, likes and shares. Some is financially motivated, and then other parts of it are propaganda. SIMON: What are some other examples that you've encountered? DONOVAN: So one of the ones that seems to be working as propaganda is a video of what are purported to be Russian paratroopers. And the video is quite stunning. (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: (Speaking Russian). DONOVAN: Russian soldiers parachuting over this vast landscape - and the claim is that they're paratrooping into Ukraine. But this is also an Instagram post from 2015. Typically, images and video like that, that evoke emotion or give you that sort of wow sensation, you want to stop yourself before you share them and either look at a fact-checking database or do a reverse image search just to do a simple gut check before you participate in the sharing. SIMON: What is a reverse image search? DONOVAN: So everybody has access to Google. If you're online, you can just simply - you right-click, you download a picture, and you can upload it to Google and get a look. There's another service that we highly recommend called TinEye - T-I-N-E-Y-E. It just searches images that are online, and they'll tell you when the first time that image appeared. And so reverse image search is just one tool that everybody has at their disposal to fight back against misinformation. SIMON: Companies including Twitter and Facebook - and we should note, Facebook's parent company, Meta, pays NPR to license NPR content - do have some tools to combat misinformation. But should they do more and not leave people to essentially fend for themselves? DONOVAN: We're at a very strange time with the design of technology platforms. If you look at the design of Facebook, Twitter and even YouTube, these are amplification systems. They are built to provide massive openness as well as to just increase the volume on any types of content. It's also incumbent upon these platform companies to realize that the disinformation campaigns that have been run for years by Russia are also something that is a product of their platforms. And so you can't have massively open information environments and then expect it not to be leveraged by media manipulators, disinformers and propagandists. SIMON: Is it, in your experience, realistic to expect people to spend 10 and 15 minutes researching the veracity of a 30-second video? DONOVAN: No, and that's why I'm on NPR today, right? It's because I want people to actually stop themselves and have some skepticism about what they're seeing online. The only people that need information in real time are the people who are in the conflict zone. In this minute, I think turning on your local news at 5:30 or tuning into the radio is going to prevent you from, one, sharing potential propaganda, and it's going to give you the best and most current information that has been verified.

The speed and scale at which this information is spreading is unprecedented. But as NPR's Geoff Brumfiel reports, some experts worry the picture painted by online posts may not always be accurate. GEOFF BRUMFIEL, BYLINE: Jeffrey Lewis saw the invasion before it began on Google Maps. Here's how it happened. His team was using commercial satellites to watch a Russian military unit. JEFFREY LEWIS: Tanks, armored personnel carriers, the whole nine yards. BRUMFIEL: The unit was outside the Russian city of Belgorod. Vehicles were lined up on the road like they were about to go somewhere. LEWIS: We were like, that unit is prepared to go plunging into Ukraine. BRUMFIEL: Lewis is a professor of arms control at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey. He and his team wanted to know how long it would take for the unit to actually reach the border. So they did what anyone would do. They plugged it into Google. And guess what. LEWIS: There was a traffic jam that began exactly where that armored unit was located. And it stretched toward the Ukrainian border. And it was 3:00 in the morning. BRUMFIEL: In Russia. In other words, the armored column was on the move, clogging the roads. The invasion had begun. Lewis tweeted out what his team had found. About an hour later, Putin declared the start of Russia's military offensive. This is the speed at which information travels in the Ukraine war. Cellphones and commercial satellites are providing a flood of data about troop movements, attacks, fleeing civilians. It's all out there for everyone to see. LEWIS: All of this data is being collected and shoved on to social media, where we can look at it. BRUMFIEL: And there is a small army of semi-professional investigators who are looking hard. Ross Burley is the executive director of the Center for Information Resilience, a U. K. group that's helping to gather and collate all the on-the-ground videos. ROSS BURLEY: The investigators and volunteers are trawling Telegram and Twitter and Twitch and all the different social media platforms that you can imagine, collecting anything that they see, and everything goes into the database. BRUMFIEL: The group is collecting around a hundred posts a day. The ones that are verified go on to a real-time map to show where the fighting is happening. Burley says that these videos could also become valuable evidence. BURLEY: Personally, I hope that our work can inform future prosecutions and that there is a degree of accountability for individuals who are involved in war crimes and other things like that. BRUMFIEL: While some groups are trying to gather everything to get a clearer sense of the big picture, most people are just seeing a handful of posts that get the most likes and shares. And that can sometimes be misleading. Take, for example, a video on TikTok of an attractive woman showing how to start a Russian armored vehicle. (SOUNDBITE OF TIKTOK)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: (Speaking Russian). BRUMFIEL: The video has over 7 million views. One person who saw it was Rita Konaev at the Center for Security and Emerging Technology at Georgetown University. She says when this video first aired. . . RITA KONAEV: It was depicted as this has been, you know, taken by Ukrainian forces or resistance. And that's not what it was. BRUMFIEL: According to a fact-check by Reuters, the woman is a Russian auto mechanic and vlogger. She filmed herself weeks before the invasion in Russia, driving the armored vehicle for fun. (SOUNDBITE OF TIKTOK)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: (Speaking Russian). KONAEV: Even though that is not something significant, I think it tells part of a broader story about the type of things that get amplified. BRUMFIEL: It turns out social media during a war is like social media the rest of the time. The fun how-to-drive-a-tank video gets lots of likes and shares as will the videos that show people what they want to see. Konaev says the problem is that these videos, even the real ones, show just a tiny sliver of what's actually happening. And when a video of a few Russian soldiers surrendering goes viral. . . KONAEV: Then it starts leading to these narratives about, you know, massive desertion, mutiny - Russian troops are about to turn around. BRUMFIEL: That story, frankly, just doesn't seem to be true. Konaev gets why so many people are being drawn to social media and why they feel the need to share what they're seeing. KONAEV: You want to feel like you understand the situation. You want to feel like you're contributing, that you're involved, that you're aware because this is a cataclysmic event. BRUMFIEL: Remember, she says, social media like simple, bite-sized stories. This war is something bigger, darker and harder to comprehend. Geoff Brumfiel, NPR News. AILSA CHANG, HOST:   Social media is awash with satellite photos and cellphone videos of the war in Ukraine.

BRUMFIEL: While some groups are trying to gather everything to get a clearer sense of the big picture, most people are just seeing a handful of posts that get the most likes and shares. And that can sometimes be misleading. Take, for example, a video on TikTok of an attractive woman showing how to start a Russian armored vehicle. (SOUNDBITE OF TIKTOK) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: (Speaking Russian). BRUMFIEL: The video has over 7 million views. One person who saw it was Rita Konaev at the Center for Security and Emerging Technology at Georgetown University. She says when this video first aired. . . RITA KONAEV: It was depicted as this has been, you know, taken by Ukrainian forces or resistance. And that's not what it was. BRUMFIEL: According to a fact-check by Reuters, the woman is a Russian auto mechanic and vlogger. She filmed herself weeks before the invasion in Russia, driving the armored vehicle for fun. (SOUNDBITE OF TIKTOK) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: (Speaking Russian). KONAEV: Even though that is not something significant, I think it tells part of a broader story about the type of things that get amplified. BRUMFIEL: It turns out social media during a war is like social media the rest of the time. The fun how-to-drive-a-tank video gets lots of likes and shares as will the videos that show people what they want to see. Konaev says the problem is that these videos, even the real ones, show just a tiny sliver of what's actually happening. And when a video of a few Russian soldiers surrendering goes viral. . . KONAEV: Then it starts leading to these narratives about, you know, massive desertion, mutiny - Russian troops are about to turn around. BRUMFIEL: That story, frankly, just doesn't seem to be true. Konaev gets why so many people are being drawn to social media and why they feel the need to share what they're seeing. KONAEV: You want to feel like you understand the situation. You want to feel like you're contributing, that you're involved, that you're aware because this is a cataclysmic event. BRUMFIEL: Remember, she says, social media like simple, bite-sized stories. This war is something bigger, darker and harder to comprehend. Geoff Brumfiel, NPR News.", "section": "Technology", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2022 NPR.  All rights reserved.

A new feature will allow users to run background checks on their matches and find out things like past arrests and convictions for certain violent crimes, as well as sex offender registry status. This comes after reports of sexual assault and other crimes following connections made on Tinder. Our single friends and those who love them were wondering how this will work and if it will really keep people safer, so we called Lisa Bonos to ask her. She writes about dating and relationships for The Washington Post, and she's with us now once again. Lisa Bonos, thanks so much for joining us once again. LISA BONOS: Thanks for having me. MARTIN: Can you tell us your initial thoughts when you first heard that criminal background checks can now be done on Tinder? BONOS: Yeah. I thought, OK, this is just one more thing that singles are supposed to do to vet someone before they meet up. It's a lot of work that goes into swiping and matching and talking and finding a safe place to meet in a way that feels comfortable for both people. And now, OK, you can run a background check, but that background check might not tell you that somebody is dangerous because plenty of people that are sexual predators are not prosecuted or arrested for those crimes. So it could give users a false sense of safety, and it also puts the onus on the user to figure out if somebody is safe rather than the platform. MARTIN: That's interesting. So the background checks provide results, quote, \"relevant to the user's safety,\" unquote. But as you were just telling us, it doesn't show everything in a person's past. So what's considered relevant to the user's safety? BONOS: Tinder has said that they're showing results relevant to a user's safety and that they're excluding drug possession, loitering or vagrancy charges. They were not super-specific about what crimes will show up. If somebody is on a sex offender registry, that should show up. They're looking for crimes of violence or sexual violence. And also, it's notable that they're only showing arrests and convictions for the United States. Things that happened outside of the States - that will not come up. MARTIN: I mean, could this affect somebody who has committed a crime, has paid their debt to society? And, you know, is this feature fair to somebody like that, somebody who has been arrested for something, you know, years ago and they've become a different person? BONOS: Right. I've been thinking a lot about that. Let's say somebody has been arrested for a crime they didn't commit. Should that follow them around on a dating app? Or if someone has done their time, is that information one of the first things that a stranger should know about them? Maybe they're safe now to interact with, or they would rather talk about that with someone one on one before seeing it just pop up on a dating app. MARTIN: That's interesting. I want to dig into something you just said a minute ago. You said in a way you think this feature allows Tinder to escape blame for bad situations that may happen as a result of a match or meetup. What are your thoughts about this? Like, how much responsibility should be on the app as opposed to the user? BONOS: Yeah. It's really hard to say. I mean, one of the main selling points of Tinder is that they have a lot of people on there, right? It is the place to go to meet all kinds of folks. And so for them, they want to capture as many people as possible on the app because that's what people go there for. If the barrier to entry is really high, then not as many people are going to want to sign up for it, and then they're not going to have the boisterous pool that they're promoting and that is what they're known for. So I spoke to a sociologist at the University of Michigan who was skeptical that Tinder's move was going to do anything substantive. She found it more symbolic and really felt like it was shifting the burden of figuring out who's safe and who's not onto the user rather than the platform. MARTIN: Before we let you go, what are your thoughts about this idea in general? I mean, obviously they think they're meeting a customer need with this. And there have been situations just like with all these apps. With, like, ridesharing apps, things - bad stuff has happened to people using them. It's just - I don't know. What are your thoughts about this, whether this is going to be considered like a standard practice or - that people will expect using these apps? I mean, it really does remind you yet again that the whole business of meeting people, you know, is hard, you know? And getting to know somebody is hard. BONOS: It is. I mean, you know, a lot of the other safety tips that are recommended, like getting on a video call with somebody just to see if they're real and if they are where they say they are, or Tinder also said that they suggest that people send real-time selfies to each other, not a picture that you have in your selfie roll from your last vacation, but, like, could you show me a picture of yourself holding a fork so you know that they didn't take it six months ago? There are all sorts of things that we do to try to figure out is this person who they say they are. And I don't know if the background checks will catch on or not, but they do highlight the fact that there's a lot of anxiety and uncertainty around this topic. MARTIN: That was Lisa Bonos for The Washington Post talking to us about the newest feature on Tinder - criminal background checks. Lisa Bonos, thanks so much for talking with us once again.

It's become a place to bear witness to the conflict and connect refugees to services. But it has also set off a debate about just how secure the messaging service is. NPR tech reporter Bobby Allyn takes a closer look at how the war put Telegram in the spotlight. BOBBY ALLYN, BYLINE: Arquan Kushnikov (ph) and his family fled Ukraine just days before the Russian invasion. Now in France, he opens Telegram to learn about the devastation of his home country. ARQUAN KUSHNIKOV: Bombing of the maternity ward in Mariupol. You have a lot of videos. Even before it hits the news, you already see the videos in the Telegram channels. ALLYN: Telegram is a hugely popular messaging app in Russia and Ukraine. It lets people subscribe to channels. They can be set up by one person or a whole organization. Many journalists, aid workers and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy himself broadcast on Telegram channels. Kushnikov says they often counter Russian propaganda with. . . KUSHNIKOV: Firsthand experiences, firsthand videos. ALLYN: In Russia, Telegram has become one of the few places residents can access independent news about the war. I talked to Andry (ph), a Russian entrepreneur living in Brazil. He asked that we not use his last name, fearing retaliation. ANDRY: There are several million Russians who can lift their head up from propaganda and try to look for other sources. And I would say that most of them look for it on Telegram. ALLYN: He gets independent news on Telegram and keeps tabs on the Kremlin's official line. And it's where he started a Russian-language channel to help Ukrainian refugees find food, shelter and other essential services. ANDRY: There is a lot of medicine, which is being delivered to Ukraine from outside by generous donations. We're trying to match logistics on this medicine. ALLYN: Telegram was founded in 2013 by two Russian brothers. One of them is Pavel Durov, known as the Russian Mark Zuckerberg because, before Telegram, he founded one of the biggest social networks in Russia. But in 2018, Russia's intelligence agency tried to get Durov to turn over messages from pro-democracy activists. Nathalie Marechal of the Washington advocacy group Ranking Digital Rights says Durov refused. NATHALIE MARECHAL: And that set off kind of a battle royale for control of the platform that Durov eventually lost. And so he and his brother and some other associates left Russia. ALLYN: They started Telegram as a way to communicate outside the Kremlin's orbit. Now they run it from Dubai. Despite Telegram's origins, its approach to user privacy worries a lot of people. By default, messages are not fully encrypted, meaning the company could, in theory, access the content of messages or be forced to hand over data at the request of a government. EVA GALPERIN: There is a significant risk of insider threat or hacking of Telegram systems that could expose all of these chats to the Russian government. ALLYN: That's Eva Galperin. She's with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which has called for Telegram to improve security. Recently, Durov, who is known for not giving interviews, wrote on his Telegram channel that users' right to privacy is, quote, \"sacred, now more than ever. \" Individual messages can be fully encrypted, but you have to turn it on. It's not automatic, unlike other apps such as Signal and WhatsApp. Galperin says that's a big problem. GALPERIN: There are a lot of things that Telegram could have been doing this whole time. And they know exactly what they are, and they've chosen not to do them. That's why I don't trust them. ALLYN: Telegram says people want to keep their chat history when they get a new phone, and they like having a data backup. And that's why they let people choose whether they want their messages to be encrypted or not. But Ukrainian Kushnikov, for one, says questions around privacy on Telegram do not give him pause when it comes to sharing information about the war. KUSHNIKOV: We, as Ukrainians, believe that the truth is on our side. When there is truth that you're proclaiming about the war and everything else, why would you want to hide it?

Over its 12-hour journey, plane spotters tracked it in real time and speculated using flight-tracking apps and other aviation data all widely available. Dan Streufert is the founder of ADS-B Exchange, a flight data co-op, and he joins us now. Welcome to the program. DAN STREUFERT: Thanks, Debbie. Good to be here. ELLIOTT: So that plane, which was briefly famous on TikTok, I might add, ended up landing outside Washington, D. C. , to collect Russian diplomats, all with the knowledge and cooperation of the governments involved. But it seems surprising that any person can monitor a Russian government plane from a phone. Where does that information come from? STREUFERT: Well, so there's an international standard. It's called ADSB, and that is typically how air traffic control will monitor the locations of aircraft. It's one particular tool that they use, but it's been mandated in most airspace. So what happens is the transponder on the plane broadcasts the location every seconds or so, and we have a network that's fed by hobbyists and enthusiasts and, you know, anybody who's interested that aggregates all this data and sticks it up on the map. So it's really a function of the avionics on the plane and the standards that broadcast the signal. ELLIOTT: So we have been seeing people look to this information for updates on the conflict in Ukraine in real time. And people are saying they're seeing fighter jets and drones and this type of thing. Are they really seeing that? I mean, how reliable is this information? STREUFERT: Yeah, it's quite reliable. I mean, every so often, there will be someone that maybe tries to fake a signal and send it in, but that's relatively easy to detect. In fact, the governments involved generally know that, you know, when they're - when they flip the switch and they're broadcasting on this channel, they know that everyone can see them. There was an incident a couple of days after the invasion started, where you could actually see an F-35 fly up and approach, you know, just across the border from Lviv. And you could see it join up with the orbiting tanker, do midair refueling. It was pretty clear that, you know, they were broadcasting these signals to basically send a message because they know when they're broadcasting, everybody can see them. That was the theory anyway, that they were sending a message to the other side that, you know, they're here in force, basically. ELLIOTT: Do you have any advice to, say, the armchair air traffic controllers out there as they try to figure out what's happening over and around Ukraine? STREUFERT: Well, you know, you can read a lot into if you see a certain plane doing something, and you can also read a lot into if, suddenly, you don't see planes doing something because that could mean that, you know, things have escalated to the point where they're going to turn their transponders off, and they don't want to be seen. You know, there's a lot of different theories, I guess, you could derive from it. I would say\\ just watch the radar. ELLIOTT: That's Dan Streufert, founder of ADS-B Exchange. Thank you so much for speaking with us. STREUFERT: Thank you, Debbie.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: I got half a million Orbeez, and I'm trying to make the world's biggest water bead stress ball. DIAZ: They put Orbeez in a bathtub, in a balloon. They squeeze them, crush them. But there's a darker side to the trend. People are filming themselves loading Orbeez into gel blaster guns and shooting them at random people. It's gotten the attention of police in Michigan, Florida and Georgia. In Michigan, Dearborn Police Chief Issa Shahin says officers have responded to at least 15 cases of people taking their gel guns and shooting random people. ISSA SHAHIN: Well, clearly, they don't understand the severity of what they're doing, and they think it's fun, or they don't recognize the consequences and what can occur by, you know, using these things to shoot people and/or, you know, buildings or property. DIAZ: According to Shahin, these little balls of mayhem can be the source of some serious pain. SHAHIN: And the reality is, is that these balls are shot at about eight of them a second at over 200 feet per second. And you can only imagine that - it's almost like a little metal BB at that - when they're frozen at that speed, and they can cause some serious damage. DIAZ: You heard right. He said some people are freezing the Orbeez before loading them into the guns. SHAHIN: We've been lucky. You know, nobody has lost an eye or suffered serious injury as of yet, but the possibility remains. DIAZ: That's why, in Dearborn, they are taking these cases seriously. SHAHIN: The charges could range from a misdemeanor assault up to a felony assault, depending on the injuries that they might cause by shooting people.

President Biden made the announcement yesterday, which brings the total cost of weaponry being provided to at least $1 billion since Russia invaded three weeks ago today. But more important than the price tag is the kind of weapons that the U. S. will be providing and what it says about the current state of war. To explain all this, we're joined by NPR national security correspondent Greg Myre. Hi, Greg. GREG MYRE, BYLINE: Hi, Leila. FADEL: So, Greg, what kind of weapons is President Biden sending to the Ukrainians? MYRE: Right. So this is the biggest package yet - $800 million. And there's three key items, all considered quite urgent. One is the Javelin missile. This is - we've been hearing a lot about this. These have been very effective in destroying Russian tanks, perhaps the single most potent weapon in Ukraine's arsenal. There's also the Stinger anti-aircraft missile. These are already being used to bring down low-flying Russian planes and helicopters and, again, been very effective. And one important new item - a drone, which the U. S. has not been supplying to Ukraine previously. It's going to send a hundred of these drones, and they'll reportedly be a type that's so small a soldier can actually just carry it in his backpack before taking it out and using it. FADEL: OK, so with these weapons being provided in mind, what does it tell us about the way Ukrainians are fighting back the Russians? MYRE: Yeah, it really shows how the Ukrainians are relying on agile, nimble, portable weapon systems, in contrast to the Russians who have more powerful weapons, like tanks and heavy artillery guns, but they can't maneuver as easily or as quickly. Now, with these missiles we've mentioned, one person puts the weapon on the shoulder, just points and shoots. This allows a small unit or even an individual to carry out an effective ambush of, say, a tank. And with the drones, the U. S. will reportedly be sending one that's formally known as the Switchblade, though it's often referred to as a kamikaze drone because they don't actually fire a weapon; the soldier just uses it and guides it to the target, and then it releases an explosive charge. And the Russians still have a big advantage when it comes to traditional manned aircraft, but these - and these small drones won't completely close that gap. But as one official said, they are intended to deliver a punch. FADEL: So let's talk about the skies over Ukraine. Ukrainian officials still calling for MiG fighter planes and for a no-fly zone. When I was in Kyiv this week, there were signs everywhere asking for NATO to close the skies. Any movement on either of these issues? MYRE: Leila, no, not really. And it really doesn't look like either of these proposals will go forward. These MiG planes belong to Poland, but they're relatively small in number, and they're older planes. The U. S. said it would take a lot of effort to keep them going and keep them in service, and they probably wouldn't make a big difference. Now, the U. S. was also opposed to a no-fly zone because the first step you'd have to take would be to attack Russian air defenses on the ground or confront Russian planes in the sky, so the expectation would almost certainly be combat with Russia. President Biden says he's not going to let that happen. FADEL: So Russia's war started three weeks ago today, as I mentioned. Ukraine has put up a huge fight. What should we be looking for next on the battlefield? MYRE: Leila, we seem to be at a stage where there's going to be big battles for the capital Kyiv and other major cities but with both sides fighting in very different ways. The Russian forces are essentially parked outside these cities. The shelling they unleash keeps getting more and more intense. They want to encircle the cities and pound the Ukrainians into submission. Now, the Ukrainians can't stop these artillery attacks, but they have been able to prevent the large Russian armored columns from entering the cities. The Ukrainians want to remain highly mobile and block all the entrance routes to the cities. And these U. S. weapons, which have been flowing and will now come in even larger quantities, are designed to do exactly that. FADEL: NPR's Greg Myre. Thank you so much. MYRE: My pleasure.

But behind the scenes, thousands of people work every day to remove violent and sexually explicit footage from the app. And now two of those workers are suing TikTok. They say that TikTok did not protect them from the emotional toll of their jobs. One of those workers spoke with NPR's Bobby Allyn. BOBBY ALLYN, BYLINE: Ashley Velez is a 36-year-old mother of two in Las Vegas. Last year, she took a job with Telus International. It's a firm that TikTok uses to review thousands of videos every day flagged as being a potential problem. In training, Velez says the job was pitched to her this way. ASHLEY VELEZ: Basically that we were going to be like a front line of defense, like, to protect mainly children. ALLYN: But when she started, it was far more distressing than what she expected. VELEZ: We would see death. We would see just graphic, graphic pornography. I've seen people get shot in the face. I cried for two hours straight watching a kid get beaten so badly, and he wasn't fighting back. And it was just horrible. ALLYN: Video after video of some of the worst things she's ever seen in her life, with only 25 seconds to decide whether they violated TikTok's rules. She was doing this work alone at home, and she had to sign a non-disclosure agreement. So she couldn't even talk about it with her family. Team meetings with her colleagues were focused on daily quotas. VELEZ: When they grouped us, it was to tell us our stats. It wasn't really like, hey, are you guys doing okay? Is everybody OK? ALLYN: She asked about mental health counseling, but she said what was offered didn't help. VELEZ: If you opt into that, you can set up a meeting with a counselor. But it's 30 minutes. Tell them who you are, and then they're moving on to the next person. ALLYN: This week, Velez and another content moderator filed a lawsuit seeking class action status. It alleges that TikTok and its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, have not done enough to protect the company's thousands of content moderators. They are represented by the same law firm that in 2021 won a $52 million settlement for Facebook moderators. Adam Kovacevich is a former Google executive who now runs the Chamber of Progress, a lobbying group backed by big tech. ADAM KOVACEVICH: These are difficult jobs. They involve reviewing upsetting content. And many of the big companies have provided, as a standard matter, counseling, breaks. ALLYN: In statements, TikTok and the contractor Telus say they do everything they can to make sure they're running safe and caring work environments. TikTok moderators are offered optional therapy, but the lawsuit says the company could do even more for these workers, like having artificial intelligence to partially blur especially graphic content, or superimposing a grid over violent videos so the whole picture isn't taken in. Kovacevich says AI systems do catch a lot of bad content. . . KOVACEVICH: But those only work to a certain point, partly for cultural reasons and partly for context. There are, sometimes things get removed by an algorithm that shouldn't be removed. And so we're at the point in the technology where we really do still need human moderators. ALLYN: Velez's lawsuit is asking for TikTok to fund a program to provide medical support for current and former moderators. The suit says suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder after this line of work is common. She says the next time you send a friend a hilarious TikTok that's gone viral, think of all the out-of-sight moderators, working long hours with very few breaks, keeping a flood of disturbing content off everyone's feed. VELEZ: I'm very glad that that's all that they get to see, and that's all that they think there is to TikTok because it has to go through somebody, and somebody has to suffer and see that for them to be able to not have to see it. ALLYN: She quit the job after just six months. TikTok is now used by more than a billion people around the world. Bobby Allyn, NPR News, San Francisco.

Or how about the smell of garbage? Well, that could soon be a thing. As Mikaela Lefrak from Vermont Public Radio reports, some tech entrepreneurs are trying to make the Metaverse feel even more real by incorporating the sense of smell. MIKAELA LEFRAK, BYLINE: At the headquarters of OVR Technology in Burlington, Vt. , smell is king. Co-Founder and CEO Aaron Wisniewski is a perfume-maker turned tech entrepreneur. He shows me his company's invention. AARON WISNIEWSKI: This right here is the technology. And you can see it's maybe the size of a candy bar or so. The cartridges - clips in. LEFRAK: Inside the cartridge are vials of scents manufactured at the OVR lab. WISNIEWSKI: That's fresh lemon. This is an herb garden. LEFRAK: He snaps the cartridge onto a virtual headset, which, if you've never seen one, looks like a massive pair of ski goggles. I pulled the whole device over my eyes and nose and enter the Metaverse. A flower box full of roses appears in front of me. I lean over, pick one and sniff. Oh, wow. That's so cool. It really smells like a rose. It's a bit like a modern day Smell-O-Vision, Hollywood's attempt from the '50s and '60s to incorporate scent into movies. A machine would pump odors into movie theaters, corresponding with the action on screen, like the smell of gun smoke during a shootout. Smell-O-Vision never really worked that well. The different smells would linger and mix together. But Hollywood was on to something. Judith Amores is a research fellow at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, focused on scent and virtual reality. She explains, our sense of smell helps us feel fully present in a place and create memories. JUDITH AMORES: The smell of your grandma or, like, you know, the particular perfume of, like, someone. I think those are very, very powerful. It's not the same just seeing the image. LEFRAK: Reproducing real world odors in a lab is a challenge. Amores says people are surprisingly good at sniffing out and dismissing artificial scents. AMORES: Wow. You know, we think that dogs are amazing at smelling. Humans are really - really are. I mean, we can smell 1 trillion different kinds of smells. We truly have a superpower. LEFRAK: Not all the smells in a virtual reality experience are going to be as pleasant as a rose. I'm reminded of that by Sarah Socia, who develops smells for OVR. She shows me some of her vials of scents. SARAH SOCIA: We have urine, garbage, diesel fuel, gunpowder, blood. . . LEFRAK: Oh. SOCIA: . . . Dirt, feces. LEFRAK: OK, this is a weird question, but can I smell garbage? SOCIA: OK (laughter). LEFRAK: Oh, yeah. Yep. That's garbage. Cool. It's easy to laugh about these malodors, as they're called, but they have important applications. They can be used in training simulations for soldiers or first responders. The market for this virtual reality scent technology is still pretty young, but the VR market as a whole is growing rapidly right now. Wisniewski and his team think that someday scent is going to be just as integral to VR headsets as audio technology is to a smartphone. That's because he believes to really experience the Metaverse, you don't just see it or hear it. You have to smell it, too. For NPR News in Burlington, I'm Mikaela Lefrak. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:   How would you like to have the smell of fresh cut flowers on demand? Or how about the smell of garbage? Well, that could soon be a thing. As Mikaela Lefrak from Vermont Public Radio reports, some tech entrepreneurs are trying to make the Metaverse feel even more real by incorporating the sense of smell. MIKAELA LEFRAK, BYLINE: At the headquarters of OVR Technology in Burlington, Vt. , smell is king. Co-Founder and CEO Aaron Wisniewski is a perfume-maker turned tech entrepreneur. He shows me his company's invention. AARON WISNIEWSKI: This right here is the technology. And you can see it's maybe the size of a candy bar or so. The cartridges - clips in. LEFRAK: Inside the cartridge are vials of scents manufactured at the OVR lab. WISNIEWSKI: That's fresh lemon. This is an herb garden. LEFRAK: He snaps the cartridge onto a virtual headset, which, if you've never seen one, looks like a massive pair of ski goggles.

The so-called IT army is government-backed but led almost entirely by civilians. (SOUNDBITE OF PODCAST, \"CLICK HERE\")JANI: Basically, once I started hearing about civilians and children and women and elderly getting bombed or killed or starved is when I basically decided that I have to do something. KURTZLEBEN: That's a member of the IT army speaking to journalist Dina Temple-Raston on a recent episode of \"Click Here,\" a podcast about all things cyber and intelligence. Dina Temple-Raston is here with us to tell us more about Ukraine's cyber army. Dina, welcome. DINA TEMPLE-RASTON, BYLINE: Thanks so much. KURTZLEBEN: Of course. So as we just heard, you spoke with a member of this Ukrainian army. What did he tell you about how this group came to be? TEMPLE-RASTON: Well, it's a very sort of modern story, right? There was a call to arms on Telegram, which is this encrypted messaging app. And they kind of built this force because Ukraine had been dealing with Russian hacking for years. So there was sort of a - people within the Ukraine who were it professionals who are really good at hacking or defense. And what they hadn't really expected is when they put out this call of arms - and this was actually the Ukrainian government that put out this call to arms. What they weren't expecting was how much the world would respond. And we spoke to essentially the guy who's in charge of their cybersecurity for the country. And he claims they have, you know, half a million people who are willing to try and help with this. KURTZLEBEN: So once they do that sort of call to arms and they get this big response, do all those people who respond, do they go through any sort of vetting? Is there any screening for proficiency at hacking? TEMPLE-RASTON: No. I mean, that's the really good question, right? So there's something in cyber known as script kiddies - kiddies like children as opposed to kittens. And script kiddies are basically people who copy other people's code and sort of talk big and have a lot of bravado. And that tape you played, that was Jani, a guy from Finland, and he said that's one of the really big problems, is that there's no vetting and that what you end up getting is a lot of sort of hacker wannabes who don't really know what they're doing. And as a result, that causes a lot of problems. Jani said there was one instance in which he was actually on what's essentially a administrators page of an important website in Russia. And he was about to go in and actually exploit the page - you know, get in there, look at the network, et cetera, et cetera. And then all of a sudden, there was an attack that was by all these script kiddies that took the system down. They basically launched a DDoS attack, a distributed denial-of-service attack. You just ask a server to do a bunch of things, and it gets overloaded, then it drops. So Jani was doing something important. A denial-of-service attack is not really an important thing. It's just an irritant. And, boom, because there was no real vetting and because there was no real organization, it sort of undid what a real professional was trying to do. KURTZLEBEN: And broadly speaking, what kind of impact has the IT army had so far? TEMPLE-RASTON: It's hard to tell. I mean, some of their hacks have been sort of cute in a way. You know, one - for example, an Anonymous hack - they've sort of joined forces with the IT army. Instead of having a restaurant reviews, like, for the sort of Russian equivalent of Yelp, what they put instead of the reviews to get by censors were news clips of what's going on at the front, right? This many people died. This city hasn't fallen. This is what's going - really going on in Ukraine. And then there was a Polish group called Squad 303, and somehow they hacked and got all these mobile numbers and email addresses of regular Russians. And they've set up a site that you could actually go to and send messages to regular Russians to tell them the truth about what's going on with the war. So those are the sorts of things they're doing, which are not - you know, it's not taking down a power grid, but it's irritants, right? And hackers are nothing if not irritating. And what some officials believe here in the U. S. is that what's happening is because the Russian hacking teams are having to defend so much, it's sort of making it harder for them to do any sort of offensive or operations against Ukraine that they might otherwise have planned to do. KURTZLEBEN: I want to play another clip from your interview with one of the volunteers when you asked him what kind of precedent this type of action sets. (SOUNDBITE OF PODCAST, \"CLICK HERE\")UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Honestly, I think it's setting a good president because at the end of the day, one thing we've been saying for a while is that we believe that now, more than ever, civilians need to learn how to not only defend but fight on the cyber front. TEMPLE-RASTON: Yeah, that's a guy from Texas that we talked to who's part of the Ukrainian IT army. And I would say that that's sort of a singular opinion. I don't think most people think this is a good idea. I mean, if you think about it, you're suddenly training a lot of people who maybe were OK at cyber. You're getting them all together, and you're teaching them new skills. And when the war is finally over, what are they going to do with all these new skills? Are we, in fact, training an entire new cohort of hackers? I mean, they're breaking a U. S. law, anyway. They're not hacking here. They're hacking elsewhere. But if they were doing this in the U. S. , they'd be breaking the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, right? So it's - it'll be really interesting. I talked to lawyers about this, and they said, well, I don't really think there are going to be too many people who are going to press charges against people who are trying to help, you know, Ukraine against the Russians. But it's setting a really, you know, unsettling precedent. KURTZLEBEN: Right. And giving people new tools and saying, we hope you use these new tools for good. TEMPLE-RASTON: Exactly. I mean, there's an old saying in hacking that the difference between a black hat hacker - a bad hacker - and a white hat hacker - good hacker - is intention, not skill. KURTZLEBEN: To zoom out here, how does the Ukrainian cyber warfare effort compare to the Russian effort at this point? TEMPLE-RASTON: Well, it's hard to tell, right? I mean, one of the things that we found that I found really interesting is that Russian hackers have this amazing reputation, right? They've hacked into Estonia's power grid. They've hacked into Ukraine's power grid. We just found out this week that the White House revealed that they've hacked into the U. S. power grid. So there's this sense that they're 10 feet tall. But what we're learning is that they're 10 feet tall when they have lots of time to plan, but they aren't all that creative or intuitive or nimble when they're hit with something they're not expecting. So maybe the best thing that came out of all of this is maybe not so much that the Ukrainian IT army sort of hacked Russia in a way that changed things materially there. Instead, what they've done is they've kind of revealed what the weaknesses are of Russian cyber army, the same way the invasion of Ukraine has shown us that this 10 foot tall, we thought, Russian army is actually maybe not as skilled as we thought they were. KURTZLEBEN: That was Dina Temple-Raston. She is the host of the \"Click Here\" podcast. Dina Temple-Raston, thank you so much. TEMPLE-RASTON: You're very welcome. Thank you.

Now they come with a 21st century twist - fake social media accounts using computer-generated photos. The professional networking site LinkedIn has taken down hundreds of these fake profiles following an investigation by Stanford University and NPR. Here's NPR tech correspondent Shannon Bond. SHANNON BOND, BYLINE: Renee DiResta usually ignores LinkedIn messages like this one. The sender, Keenan Ramsey, mentioned they both belong to a LinkedIn group for entrepreneurs before pivoting to a pitch for software. But something about Ramsey's profile picture made DiResta pause. RENEE DIRESTA: The face jumped out at me as being fake. BOND: It looked like a typical corporate headshot, but little details were off. DIRESTA: She has mismatched earrings. Now, I myself have mismatched earrings (laughter), and I'm real. So that's not - you know, that's not the be all, end all. But you can see the way her hair sort of blurs into the background. There's pieces that just kind of come out of nowhere. On one side, it looks almost like it breaks off, but then comes back at the bottom. BOND: Also, Ramsey's eyes were aligned perfectly in the middle of the image. Individually, these things could all be explained away. But together, they made DiResta suspicious. She happens to be a researcher at the Stanford Internet Observatory who's studied Russian disinformation campaigns and anti-vaccine conspiracies. And to her trained eye, these anomalies were red flags that the photo had likely been created by artificial intelligence. DIRESTA: You know, in the course of my work, I look at a lot of these things, mostly in the context of political influence operations. But all of a sudden, here was a fake person in my inbox. BOND: That message launched DiResta and her colleague Josh Goldstein on an investigation that uncovered more than 1,000 LinkedIn profiles with these apparently fake faces. Similar fake social media accounts have been used to push Russian propaganda about Ukraine and spread Chinese disinformation on Facebook and Twitter. But these profiles on LinkedIn - they're being used to spam people about products and services. Here's how it works. The profiles claim to work for more than 70 different companies. They send LinkedIn messages to potential customers, like the one DiResta got from Ramsey, pitching software from a company called RingCentral. DIRESTA: Their message was inviting me to set up a time to talk about RingCentral for my startup, which I no longer have. BOND: Anyone who takes the bait gets connected to a real person who tries to close the deal. Now, NPR didn't find anything illegal, and in some ways, it's not surprising that people are now using the latest technology to get an edge on LinkedIn, which is all about professional networking. The pandemic made it harder for many salespeople to do their jobs in person, so there's a lot of demand to make virtual connections. And creating profiles with fake faces is tempting. It's cheaper than hiring real people. You can't immediately debunk them with a reverse image search, and the faces are really convincing. HANY FARID: They are now as realistic as real faces and slightly more trustworthy, which is super interesting and really creepy. BOND: That's Hany Farid, a digital forensic expert at the University of California, Berkeley. He co-authored a recent study that found people have just a 50% chance of guessing correctly whether a face was created by a computer. That's no better than flipping a coin. He also found that people say they trust faces made by AI a bit more than real ones. Farid thinks that's because the software tends to stick to the most average features when generating a face. FARI: It turns out that the average face - if you take a bunch of faces and align them and compute an average of all of them, that face tends to look trustworthy. Because it's familiar, right? It's - looks like something, like, of somebody we know. BOND: These days, fake faces are widely available. You can go online right now and download them for free. And it's this proliferation of AI-generated content that worries Farid. Because while using synthetic salespeople to send pitches on LinkedIn might not seem all that serious. . . FARI: It is the canary in the coal mine. BOND: And the way this technology is advancing, today's trustworthy fake face could quickly become tomorrow's fraudulent video. MART\u00cdNEZ: And Shannon is here to tell us more about these fake accounts, starting with - actually, starting with - these fake faces, Shannon, are terrifying me. It's like a Jordan Peele movie, to tell you the truth. But who's behind all these things? BOND: Yeah, A, that was my first question, too. So I called up RingCentral, the company where dozens of these profiles claim to work, including that Keenan Ramsey account who first messaged Renee DiResta. And a spokesperson said RingCentral had never heard of any of them. Another previous employer listed on Ramsey's LinkedIn profile said the same thing. And NYU, where she says she got an undergraduate business degree, doesn't have any record of her either. So what RingCentral told me is, it's hired other companies to reach out to potential customers about its software. And RingCentral says one of them created the fake profiles. Here's what Heather Hinton, RingCentral's chief information security officer, told me. HEATHER HINTON: There was something going on that we hadn't been aware of. And so we've gone and - you know, this is not how we do business. BOND: And this is what I heard from many of the companies these profiles claimed to work for. They had hired outside marketers to help with sales. Now, that's not unusual or suspicious, but these companies said they had not approved any use of computer-generated images. MART\u00cdNEZ: Yeah, outside marketers, outside companies - who are they? BOND: Yeah, these are people who sell LinkedIn marketing services. And I tried contacting a lot of them. Most would not talk to me. One I did hear from was called airSales. It told me it works with freelancers who might make LinkedIn profiles, but that airSales was not involved. We also found the website of another one, called LIA, advertising what it calls AI-generated LinkedIn avatars for $300 a month. They say they have hundreds of these avatars, which look an awful lot like the fake accounts Stanford found. And these are just ready for a client to choose from. Now, no one in LIA responded at my attempts to contact them, and it's now scrubbed all information from its website. And ultimately, we weren't able to verify who made these profiles or find anyone who authorized them. MART\u00cdNEZ: What does LinkedIn have to say about this? BOND: Well, it's taken down most of the accounts the Stanford team found, and it says it has rules against creating fake accounts or falsifying information. People are supposed to use real pictures of themselves. And LinkedIn says it's constantly improving its detection models to catch profiles with fake faces. MART\u00cdNEZ: Shannon, do we know how common these fake profiles are on LinkedIn? BOND: Well, LinkedIn has 810 million members. And, you know, Stanford identified around a thousand fake accounts, so that's a small portion. But, A, since my story published, I've heard from lots of people saying they've encountered profiles similar to these being used for other purposes on LinkedIn, like recruiting them for jobs. So I think it's likely there are a lot more of these on the platform than we've identified here. MART\u00cdNEZ: So just how suspicious should we all be about people reaching out on LinkedIn? BOND: Well, you know, all social media platforms have problems with fake accounts. What's different here, though, is these AI-generated faces. You know, they're just - they're so realistic and they're just so available. It's easy for anyone to use them. So it's good advice in general to be skeptical about what you're seeing online. You know, if someone's reaching out to you - asking who they are and what their motivation for contacting you is. MART\u00cdNEZ: I'm going to stare deep into those AI-generated eyes. That's NPR tech correspondent Shannon Bond. Shannon, thanks. BOND: Thanks, A. MART\u00cdNEZ: And just a note - LinkedIn and its parent company, Microsoft, are among NPR's financial supporters.

The sender, Keenan Ramsey, mentioned they both belong to a LinkedIn group for entrepreneurs before pivoting to a pitch for software. But something about Ramsey's profile picture made DiResta pause. RENEE DIRESTA: The face jumped out at me as being fake. BOND: It looked like a typical corporate headshot, but little details were off. DIRESTA: She has mismatched earrings. Now, I myself have mismatched earrings (laughter), and I'm real. So that's not - you know, that's not the be all, end all. But you can see the way her hair sort of blurs into the background. There's pieces that just kind of come out of nowhere. On one side, it looks almost like it breaks off, but then comes back at the bottom. BOND: Also, Ramsey's eyes were aligned perfectly in the middle of the image. Individually, these things could all be explained away. But together, they made DiResta suspicious. She happens to be a researcher at the Stanford Internet Observatory who's studied Russian disinformation campaigns and anti-vaccine conspiracies. And to her trained eye, these anomalies were red flags that the photo had likely been created by artificial intelligence. DIRESTA: You know, in the course of my work, I look at a lot of these things, mostly in the context of political influence operations. But all of a sudden, here was a fake person in my inbox. BOND: That message launched DiResta and her colleague Josh Goldstein on an investigation that uncovered more than 1,000 LinkedIn profiles with these apparently fake faces. Similar fake social media accounts have been used to push Russian propaganda about Ukraine and spread Chinese disinformation on Facebook and Twitter. But these profiles on LinkedIn - they're being used to spam people about products and services. Here's how it works. The profiles claim to work for more than 70 different companies. They send LinkedIn messages to potential customers, like the one DiResta got from Ramsey, pitching software from a company called RingCentral. DIRESTA: Their message was inviting me to set up a time to talk about RingCentral for my startup, which I no longer have. BOND: Anyone who takes the bait gets connected to a real person who tries to close the deal. Now, NPR didn't find anything illegal, and in some ways, it's not surprising that people are now using the latest technology to get an edge on LinkedIn, which is all about professional networking. The pandemic made it harder for many salespeople to do their jobs in person, so there's a lot of demand to make virtual connections. And creating profiles with fake faces is tempting. It's cheaper than hiring real people. You can't immediately debunk them with a reverse image search, and the faces are really convincing. HANY FARID: They are now as realistic as real faces and slightly more trustworthy, which is super interesting and really creepy. BOND: That's Hany Farid, a digital forensic expert at the University of California, Berkeley. He co-authored a recent study that found people have just a 50% chance of guessing correctly whether a face was created by a computer. That's no better than flipping a coin. He also found that people say they trust faces made by AI a bit more than real ones. Farid thinks that's because the software tends to stick to the most average features when generating a face. FARI: It turns out that the average face - if you take a bunch of faces and align them and compute an average of all of them, that face tends to look trustworthy. Because it's familiar, right? It's - looks like something, like, of somebody we know. BOND: These days, fake faces are widely available. You can go online right now and download them for free. And it's this proliferation of AI-generated content that worries Farid. Because while using synthetic salespeople to send pitches on LinkedIn might not seem all that serious. . . FARI: It is the canary in the coal mine. BOND: And the way this technology is advancing, today's trustworthy fake face could quickly become tomorrow's fraudulent video. MART\u00cdNEZ: And Shannon is here to tell us more about these fake accounts, starting with - actually, starting with - these fake faces, Shannon, are terrifying me. It's like a Jordan Peele movie, to tell you the truth. But who's behind all these things? BOND: Yeah, A, that was my first question, too. So I called up RingCentral, the company where dozens of these profiles claim to work, including that Keenan Ramsey account who first messaged Renee DiResta. And a spokesperson said RingCentral had never heard of any of them. Another previous employer listed on Ramsey's LinkedIn profile said the same thing. And NYU, where she says she got an undergraduate business degree, doesn't have any record of her either. So what RingCentral told me is, it's hired other companies to reach out to potential customers about its software. And RingCentral says one of them created the fake profiles. Here's what Heather Hinton, RingCentral's chief information security officer, told me. HEATHER HINTON: There was something going on that we hadn't been aware of. And so we've gone and - you know, this is not how we do business. BOND: And this is what I heard from many of the companies these profiles claimed to work for. They had hired outside marketers to help with sales. Now, that's not unusual or suspicious, but these companies said they had not approved any use of computer-generated images. MART\u00cdNEZ: Yeah, outside marketers, outside companies - who are they? BOND: Yeah, these are people who sell LinkedIn marketing services. And I tried contacting a lot of them. Most would not talk to me. One I did hear from was called airSales. It told me it works with freelancers who might make LinkedIn profiles, but that airSales was not involved. We also found the website of another one, called LIA, advertising what it calls AI-generated LinkedIn avatars for $300 a month. They say they have hundreds of these avatars, which look an awful lot like the fake accounts Stanford found. And these are just ready for a client to choose from. Now, no one in LIA responded at my attempts to contact them, and it's now scrubbed all information from its website. And ultimately, we weren't able to verify who made these profiles or find anyone who authorized them. MART\u00cdNEZ: What does LinkedIn have to say about this? BOND: Well, it's taken down most of the accounts the Stanford team found, and it says it has rules against creating fake accounts or falsifying information. People are supposed to use real pictures of themselves. And LinkedIn says it's constantly improving its detection models to catch profiles with fake faces. MART\u00cdNEZ: Shannon, do we know how common these fake profiles are on LinkedIn? BOND: Well, LinkedIn has 810 million members. And, you know, Stanford identified around a thousand fake accounts, so that's a small portion. But, A, since my story published, I've heard from lots of people saying they've encountered profiles similar to these being used for other purposes on LinkedIn, like recruiting them for jobs. So I think it's likely there are a lot more of these on the platform than we've identified here. MART\u00cdNEZ: So just how suspicious should we all be about people reaching out on LinkedIn? BOND: Well, you know, all social media platforms have problems with fake accounts. What's different here, though, is these AI-generated faces. You know, they're just - they're so realistic and they're just so available. It's easy for anyone to use them. So it's good advice in general to be skeptical about what you're seeing online. You know, if someone's reaching out to you - asking who they are and what their motivation for contacting you is. MART\u00cdNEZ: I'm going to stare deep into those AI-generated eyes. That's NPR tech correspondent Shannon Bond. Shannon, thanks. BOND: Thanks, A. MART\u00cdNEZ: And just a note - LinkedIn and its parent company, Microsoft, are among NPR's financial supporters.

NPR's cybersecurity correspondent Jenna McLaughlin joins us now to unpack it all. Hi, Jenna. JENNA MCLAUGHLIN, BYLINE: Hey, Ailsa. CHANG: So, you know, we've heard so much about cyber in the lead-up to this war, but it never really came, right? Why is that? MCLAUGHLIN: Sure. So all of my friends have been asking me exactly that - where is the cyber war we were promised? You know, will this latest comment from President Biden, for example, be Putin's excuse to shut down the energy grid? You know, it's hard to say exactly why that hasn't happened. There's a lot of theories about Russia wanting to keep the internet up for themselves, for example, operations we don't know about yet, plus the reality that bombs, rather than cyberattacks, are an easier way, in a lot of cases, to destroy critical infrastructure. CHANG: True. MCLAUGHLIN: But all along, cyberattacks have been a useful tool for helping with broader strategies. It's really been a thorn in Ukraine's side. CHANG: Oh, really? How so? Say more about that. MCLAUGHLIN: Sure. So, look, I mean, the biggest attack was maybe the most subtle, and it's still being investigated, and that was on European satellites at the beginning of the invasion. That prevented the Ukrainian military from communicating in some cases. Those hackers are actually still targeting the satellites, and it's been really challenging to resume service in Ukraine, though it appears there hasn't been permanent damage. It's hard to attribute an attack like that this early, but Western intelligence agencies are pointing to Russia as the culprit. Beyond that, we've also seen a massive amount of denial-of-service attacks, tampering with Ukrainian media sites, wiper malware destroying some computers in Ukrainian government agencies and companies. Just this week, we saw an attack on a Ukrainian internet provider that Ukrainian officials were investigating, and that's just what the Russians are doing. CHANG: Right. Well, what about on the Ukrainian side? What kind of cyber war efforts do we see there? MCLAUGHLIN: It's really been fascinating. We've seen this mobilization of Ukrainians in all walks of life to volunteer for the war effort, and that includes in cyber and information space. There's a volunteer IT Army of hackers who are working with the Ministry of Digital Transformation. There's a collective of artists and translators and others fighting the information war against Russia with memes. Plus, hacktivists have come to Ukraine's side. A collective of hackers under the banner of Anonymous, a group that's been around for decades, have claimed to breach a large number of prominent Russian agencies, but it'll probably take researchers years to verify and go through all that information. CHANG: Huh, interesting. Well, you know, we have also been hearing that Russia might launch a cyberattack against the U. S. What does that possibility look like right now? MCLAUGHLIN: Yeah. So over recent weeks, the White House, the FBI, DHS's cyber agency, CISA, have been increasing their alarm about a possible Russian cyberattack against U. S. businesses, and that would be a - sort of a retaliatory blow for U. S. support to Ukraine in the war. They haven't gone into too much detail, but they are saying that they're seeing bad actors scanning the internet for vulnerable networks. They're essentially seeking out potential targets who haven't patched known vulnerabilities that they could use as a foothold to get inside, particularly in the energy sector. So this kind of activity happens all the time, but an increase in targeted activity toward one sector could suggest a possible attack. During a hearing yesterday, the assistant director of the FBI's Cyber Division, Brian Vorndran, said that it's impossible to predict if Russia will launch this kind of attack or use cyber to win the war, but he called Russia a formidable foe in cyberspace.

I'm Dave Davies, in for Terry Gross, who's off this week. One constant theme of reporting on the Russian invasion of Ukraine is surprise at and admiration for the Ukrainian military's effectiveness in fighting Russian troops. Our guest today, Time magazine correspondent Vera Bergengruen reports that Ukraine has also been successful in waging war on the digital battlefield. A key figure in the country's efforts is its 31-year-old Minister of Digital Transformation Mykhailo Fedorov, a man who'd previously run digital communications in Volodymyr Zelenskyy's successful presidential campaign. Bergengruen writes that Fedorov's ministry is inventing a whole new way to fight a war online. They've recruited thousands of citizen volunteers in efforts to undermine Russian disinformation campaigns. They've shored up international support and gotten tech companies to block services in Russia. And their social media campaign of videos with President Zelenskyy has united and lifted the morale of Ukrainians. Vera Bergengruen previously reported for the Miami Herald, BuzzFeed News and the McClatchy newspaper's Washington Bureau, where she worked on the Pulitzer Prize-winning Panama Papers investigation. She's now an investigative correspondent in Time's Washington bureau covering online disinformation and national security. Well, Vera Bergengruen, welcome to FRESH AIR. VERA BERGENGRUEN: Thank you for having me. DAVIES: A key figure in this fascinating story is this 31-year-old guy named Mykhailo Fedorov. Tell us about him. BERGENGRUEN: One of the first things that struck me about Fedorov when I talked to him via video chat is just how young he is. He is the youngest member of Zelenskyy's cabinet. He's only 31. He ran his campaign back in 2019 to become president. And he clearly is just kind of a young techie guy who now kind of finds himself in the front line of this digital battle. And we spoke for - he was at an undisclosed location within Kyiv. And he was telling me all about his efforts to basically repurpose all of these digital tools that he spent years developing to fight a modern war. And he himself seemed to kind of think that it was crazy that he found himself in this situation. But ultimately, it's clearly very effective. He's been able to take all of these ambitious efforts - you know, reaching out to Silicon Valley, trying to work - you know, their ambition is always to partner with Apple, with Google, with all of these tech giants that they admire in Ukraine, to do all of these kind of mundane bureaucratic projects. And then they turned it all around to help their country fight a war. DAVIES: Of course, a big part of this is communication. I mean, it's - you're an advocate, and your audience is people abroad. It's people in Ukraine. It's people everywhere. Let's talk about some of the content that's been posted on social media in support of the Ukrainian resistance. Tell us about how they've built morale and united the country in this effort. What kinds of material have they been putting up? BERGENGRUEN: It's been a mix of kind of what we would call standard war propaganda in the sense that all war content is often propaganda. So we've seen so many tales of heroism. You know, there was the mythical ghost of Kyiv who was, you know, allegedly a fighter pilot who was taking out all of these, you know, Russian targets. You know, we don't think he's real. But there's been all of these kind of war stories that have really galvanized people behind them. But so many of them have been real. So many of them have been really galvanizing messages. You know, there was Zelenskyy himself, who's such an inspiring figure for many Ukrainians and for people abroad, and he just very naturally, you know, his - given that his background is as an actor, as a comedian, he naturally stepped into this role and almost seemed to have all these ready one-liners that immediately went viral. You know, his famous line, I don't - you know, I need more ammunition; I don't need a ride - when they offered to get him out of Kyiv. We've got Ukrainians themselves, you know - there was - early in the war, there was this old woman who came up to a Russian soldier and told him to take sunflower seeds in his pocket, so when he died on Ukrainian soil, at least flowers would bloom. And there's all these moments kind of captured on camera and immediately making their way around the globe that have done the work of the Ukrainian government for them, in many senses, to really get the message out there, to show resilience, to show resistance. But a lot of this doesn't just happen by magic. It's not that it's not real. But the Ukrainian government is relying on a lot of digital savvy, a lot of existing infrastructure, to make sure that all of this information gets out into the world. So, for example, one of the ways that I think they've been very effective is their digital ministers told me that Ukrainians actually don't really use Twitter as much as we do here, you know, especially the government. You know, they use it, but it's not as popular an app. They use other apps. But they know that people in the United States and in Western Europe are obsessed with Twitter. We're on it all the time. So what they did is, you know, they went on Twitter. They made sure that everything that they would usually put out through other mechanisms is on this app in order to reach their target audience, which is mainly people abroad. So in other words, they've really been able to collect all of these examples of resistance, of resilience, of heroism, which are, you know, often, obviously, real stories. But they're relying on a lot of digital know-how in order to make sure that they reach the target audience. DAVIES: You know, it's easy to forget that in the early days of the war, there was a wide expectation that the Russians would quickly take Kyiv, and people might have been expecting President Zelenskyy to, you know, leave and form a government in exile. The fact that he's stayed there and continued to make these videos saying, we are here, we're not going anywhere, we're fighting - that was pretty inspirational, wasn't it? BERGENGRUEN: It was. And it's the thing that brought much of the world to Ukraine's side because, you know, when you try to imagine someone beside Zelenskyy or maybe someone who did leave or maybe someone who stayed but chose not to be so public, chose not to film these truly unprecedented videos of themself, you know, a world leader filming himself, you know, on the selfie mode on his smartphone, walking around Kyiv and giving these - you know, these messages to his people, you know, I think it's fair to say that a lot of the world, which is - ultimately, unfortunately, care less about what's happening in Ukraine. He's a very effective spokesman. And, you know, again, in the early days of the war, so much of the world support hinged on Zelenskyy's messages both to the world through social media, to world leaders and to parliaments and to Congress. He did every single thing he could to get the message out there. But the style in which he did it is just so perfectly made for 2022. It's bite-sized. It's on video. He's wearing this, you know, olive T-shirt. He's not wearing a - when he's speaking - even when he's speaking to - you know, to the world governments, to world leaders, he's not wearing a suit. He's in the streets of Kyiv kind of filming himself. And all of this is just made kind of for maximum effect to really get the direness of the situation across. DAVIES: I know there are updates on what's happening in the war that come along in a lot of these social media posts. The other thing, you know, is that, you know, the Russians are famously effective at disinformation. And you write that one of the things that Mykhailo Fedorov and the ministry have done is to blunt these efforts at disinformation, not just debunking them but pre-bunking them - that is to say, getting out ahead of the message. Give us an example of this. BERGENGRUEN: Right. And this is something that I think Russia didn't really anticipate because they are masters of kind of chaos. We - you know, Dave, it's interesting. I feel like we all, you know, in the United States, in Europe, especially after 2016, had this impression of the Russians as master social media manipulators. Like, we don't really know what they're doing. They get in there, and we just can't prevent them from manipulating all of us. But ultimately, all these experts and analysts I speak with say that they're kind of unsophisticated when it comes to social media. And what they really do is flood the zone with so much information that people don't really know what to believe. And in this case, Ukrainians were able to get ahead of it. We have to remember that Ukraine is very familiar with Russian tactics, much more than even we are in the United States, because they've been at the receiving end of it for years and years, and they've been at war with, you know, in parts of Ukraine with Russia for a long time. So they know that one of the most effective ways to get ahead of it is to not allow these disinformation narratives to take root at all. So, for example, when rumors started circulating that Zelenskyy has fled, they immediately put him on camera. I think he even held up his phone while someone filmed them to show the date. So they knew that this was a, you know, a correct video and that it was accurate. And he shows himself and says, you know, I haven't fled. In another case, they warned people ahead of time that there were going to be rumors that Ukrainian soldiers were laying down their arms, that they were surrendering to Russia early in the war. And even before Russia was able to fully blast this one-way megaphone of disinformation out there, before it could take root, they warned people about it, and it wasn't really effective. Instead of trying to fact-check it, it just ended up prebunking it, which meant it couldn't even take root. People knew about this narrative before they even heard about it. And it just ultimately ended up being ineffective. DAVIES: One of the things you've written is that the Ukrainian Ministry of Digital Transformation has recruited regular citizens for this effort, up to 300,000. Is this right, kind of citizen volunteers in this - what you refer to as an IT army? BERGENGRUEN: Yeah, this is actually Fedorov's words, an IT army, a tech army. And he's very proud of it. And it is - I have seen it. It's 300,000 people on the messaging app Telegram who are all - many of them are drawn from Ukraine's kind of entrepreneurialism tech class. They're people who worked at tech companies, who had startups, who are cybersecurity experts, and many of them are just ordinary citizens who raised their hands. They all only get there by being vouched for by other experts. So they say that it's a pretty, you know, select group. But these are all people who are basically volunteering to use their digital skills in a range of different ways in order to either protect Ukraine's digital efforts from Russian attacks - and, again, they are very familiar with Russian attacks after eight years of this - or to actually attack Russian infrastructure or digital assets themselves. DAVIES: You know, when we talk about an army, you know, armies - that is to say traditional armies - they recruit people. So they vet people. Not anybody - just anybody gets to come in. There's training. And there's a command structure, so that in theory, you have an idea of who's in your army, and you know they'll follow orders. To what extent does that model follow this IT army, or are they more like a guerrilla force that's out there? How does it work? What do they do? BERGENGRUEN: From my perspective here, it does seem more like a guerrilla force. It seems like a lot of very smart techie people who know exactly how to use - you know, they basically give it a list of targets, and they go after them. But, you know, it is impressive when you speak to Fedorov, when you speak to other people inside the Digital Transformation Ministry. And they are ultimately more than 650 people who work for it. And they definitely are - before the war were pretty bureaucratic. They had different offices. They have different command structures. And they had a lot of very ambitious projects. And they've pulled people from all those projects to moderate this group, to give them lists of targets, to kind of see where it's going. But you can obviously tell that in the chaos of the war - and again, we have to remember these people are living through it themselves. Some of them are out of the country, but most of them are there. And obviously, a lot of things kind of fall through the cracks. You know, at one point, I asked him how many letters he had actually sent to tech companies or how many targets they had given this group. And they didn't even, you know, they don't have a full number. It's obviously rather decentralized. But at the same time, so far, it seems pretty effective. And if anything, what this does is, especially organizing through apps like Telegram - it means that when things come up, when things change, when Russia launches a new attack, they've got a ready-made group of people who are already alert and kind of mobilized to respond. DAVIES: You know, there's an old saying that the first casualty in war is the truth. You know, governments lie and spin to gain advantage, as do, you know, combatants and armies. And you write that in this case, this digital effort, that the leader here, Mykhailo Fedorov, monitors Ukrainian messaging for any disinformation. What does he say about this? Why is this important? BERGENGRUEN: It was really interesting speaking to him about this because, in many ways, a lot of these young Ukrainian digital ministers use the language of Silicon Valley. They use the language of, you know, American tech as well. Or they basically say - the way he phrased it to me was we are protecting our brand. Our brand is one of an honest people that are being attacked. It's a black-and-white war. And we have to completely have transparency and clarity about what is happening. We can't afford to mess up. We can't afford to be broadcasting our own disinformation because that will muddy the waters, and that will start putting us closer to the same level as Russia. And that is a really real fear with them. And so what they do, according to what Fedorov told me, is, you know, they've got several teams set up that vet every single message that Zelenskyy or, you know, other digital ministers and regular ministers put out. They get the information in it. They make sure that it's accurate. They make sure that they're not really putting out videos out of context and things that could be misunderstood. So that doesn't obviously stop them from engaging in regular war propaganda, which is amplifying tales of, again, resistance, heroism. You know, those kind of things are still out there. But they want to make sure that they can't really put anything out there that Russia can then turn against them and prove Russia's false allegations that the Ukrainians are lying about the war itself. So I thought it was really interesting that he framed it as we are protecting our brand. Our brand is Ukraine is the attacked nation, the wronged nation. And we are the ones who speak the truth. DAVIES: We need to take a break here. Let me reintroduce you. We are speaking with Vera Bergengruen. She's an investigative correspondent in Time's Washington bureau covering online disinformation and national security. She'll be back to talk more after this short break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF CUONG VU AND PAT METHENY'S \"SEEDS OF DOUBT\")DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. We're speaking with TIME investigative correspondent Vera Bergengruen. She's been reporting on Ukraine's success so far in waging digital war and resisting the Russian invasion. One of the things that the digital information ministry in Ukraine has focused on is getting big tech companies, particularly American tech companies, to enforce a digital blockade of Russia. How has this gone? BERGENGRUEN: Ukraine's digital ministry has been kind of shockingly effective at how quickly they've been able to get big tech giants to, you know, give in to some of their demands. And one of the reasons is that they are obviously very effective at social media itself. They've got people like Fedorov, the digital minister, or Zelenskyy himself directly tagging - you know, connecting to big tech companies - to Facebook, to Google, to Apple - on social media, on Twitter, kind of connecting them to the war crimes - to what they say are war crimes happening in Ukraine. They're saying, listen. Look at how your technology is being used by Russia. Every single dollar that goes towards the Russian government is being used for this war. And they've been, you know, very effective at this. And just by tagging some of these companies, they've been able to immediately get a response, which is pretty surprising, at least from the outside. When you speak to them on the inside, they acknowledge that they've been in talks with these companies for a while, that they're pushing them, and that by the time they send out that tweet, they've already kind of, you know, often talked to them behind the scenes and really, you know, sent them personal letters and tried to push them to do the right thing, in their words. DAVIES: So there's an inside game - personal - private negotiations, but they're not beyond shaming them publicly if they need to. BERGENGRUEN: Right. And the public shaming, I mean, I think it's hard to overstate how effective it's been because, again - you know, for example, they're not usually that active on Twitter, but they took to Twitter because they know that is the way that hundreds of thousands of people around the world are going to amplify their message. And, you know, these companies that usually take a very long time to take any kind of action moved extremely quickly by their own standards. You know, they've banned Russian outlets in Europe in many apps. They, you know, really quickly suspended Apple Pay in Russia. They basically ended up pulling so many of these services that ordinary Russian citizens rely on very, very quickly out of Russia. And this was almost - I mean, I think it's fair to say a lot of the credit goes to the public shaming that Fedorov and these digital ministers immediately started doing when the invasion began. DAVIES: It was also interesting - you know, the digital ministry, for its efforts, needs to have its citizen digital soldiers connected to the internet, which is not easy given, you know, the ferocity of the Russian bombing and missile campaign. And one of the things you wrote about is that Elon Musk sent out - what? - several trucks to connect Ukrainians with his Starlink satellite-based internet service, right? Was this significant? How did this happen? BERGENGRUEN: This is one of those things that, from the outside, looked almost shockingly, stunningly fast because we saw Fedorov send a tweet asking Elon Musk for help. And less than 48 hours later, he tweeted a photo showing, you know, a truck full of these Starlink satellite connectors. And it was pretty - you know, from the outside, it's kind of crazy that they were able to send that to Ukraine so quickly. When I spoke with him, you know, he acknowledged that he had been in talks with them for a while and that when they actually knew that it might happen, they were able to kind of put that on the outside. But, you know, it has been effective. They've - some of these have been able to connect a lot of Ukrainians, you know, to the internet. One of the ministers I spoke with actually spoke with me through this Starlink connection that he had set up. And, you know, that's just an really easy way for people like Musk to make a pretty big difference because without the internet, all of these things that we've been talking about obviously are impossible. DAVIES: Let me reintroduce you again. We're going to take another break. Vera Bergengruen is an investigative correspondent in TIME magazine's Washington bureau covering online disinformation and national security. She'll be back to talk more after this short break. I'm Dave Davies, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF GUILLERMO KLEIN'S \"MELODIA DE ARRABAL\")DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies, in for Terry Gross, who's off this week. We're speaking with Vera Bergengruen, an investigative correspondent in Time magazine's Washington bureau covering online disinformation and national security. She's written recently about Ukraine's efforts to wage digital war in its resistance to the Russian invasion, an effort headed by its 31-year-old minister of digital transformation, who'd previously run digital operations on Vladimir Zelenskyy's 2019 presidential campaign. You know, you told us about this massive IT army, this - these citizen volunteers that are involved in this digital effort. Can you give us a little more sense of what they do? BERGENGRUEN: So even though it's described as an IT army and we think of them as hackers and people - you know, techie people just kind of going after these targets, it's much broader than that. One really interesting effort has been that they've recruited influential, you know, Instagram influencers. They've recruited people who have millions of followers. And, you know, think of people who post about skin care or models or, you know, people who post about their kids or schools, things like that, especially young women. They've recruited over 200 of them in a separate Telegram channel, and they coordinate them to broadcast the message that they want. So think of 200 social media celebrities who are just being told, today we're going to talk about this. Or, you know, this thing that you're hearing about the bombing of this hospital is really important; we want you to talk to your followers about that. And these are people who, again, have millions of followers. And that is, I think, an underappreciated part of this. It's not just going after Russian targets or someone sitting in a dark room trying to hack into a Russian government system; it's a much more public-facing effort in terms of having a lot of these - again, imagine, you know, there's a model with 2 million followers who will go on Instagram and talk about, you know, what's happening on the ground in Ukraine or how she's being personally affected by it. And that is something that I think we're really underestimating in terms of its power. And another way that they're using this IT army, for example, is to organize systems where they can recruit even more volunteers. So they're recruiting volunteers both, like we said, in terms of cyber experts but also, for example, foreign fighters. They are using Telegram in order to put out calls for foreign fighters to come into Ukraine to help fight with the Ukrainian army. And all of this is being coordinated by the digital ministry. So this kind of - this digital army, this IT army, is truly much broader than those very talented hackers who we know are going after Russian targets. DAVIES: Who is Stepan, the Instagram cat? BERGENGRUEN: (Laughter) Stepan is a Ukrainian cat whose owner set up an account last year on Instagram and TikTok and just shared funny photos of her cat, who's just very comical. So people really love following this cat. I mean, Britney Spears was one of this cat's followers. And then when the war started, suddenly these accounts took a very somber turn and started posting updates about the war. And, you know, through this, actually, the owner has been able to raise some money to help Ukrainians, I think a pretty significant amount. But I think it speaks to a much bigger thing, which is many of us didn't even realize how many Ukrainians we were following. I mean, this happened not just with this Instagram-famous cat and TikTok-famous cat, but, you know, there's just a lot of content creators on social media who suddenly went dark or who suddenly started reporting from bomb shelters, when usually they were, you know, posting skin care tips or, you know, some other kind of content. And I think that has been one of the most effective tools as well in order to raise awareness and galvanize support for Ukraine because, ultimately, this is just something that a lot of people relate to. And I think, you know, people like this cat - well, not people (laughter). Accounts like this cat end up really reaching people who usually might not be tuned in to this war. DAVIES: To what extent does the does the ministry, does this digital effort, try to appeal to Russian soldiers or their families? BERGENGRUEN: Appealing directly to Russians has been a really big part of these efforts. And you can tell because they often speak in Russian, and they will make a point of it. So one of the biggest efforts has been a website and a Telegram channel that were set up in order to identify prisoners of war. So they want Russians, who often - you know, there's this digital iron curtain that's preventing them from knowing much of what's happening. They're not reading or watching the same news that we are. They're not really seeing, you know, the carnage in Ukraine. And so one of the things that they did is they set up a Telegram channel - because this app is not blocked in Russia - and setting up a website where they just post videos and photos of prisoners of war, of young Russians usually, and they have them identify themselves, and then they try to blast that one way over the border so that people can kind of find, you know, their loved ones. And we know, anecdotally, that that's been very effective. You know, there's a lot of stories of mothers, of - you know, of families, of friends, sending each other these photos, saying, you know, oh, my God, that's my brother. You know, what's he doing in Ukraine? And it's been very effective to speak directly to Russians. But in terms of the digital ministry, they often just make sure that they put their government officials, their most high-ranking officials, on camera, speaking in Russian directly to Russians. We saw this very effectively, I think, with Zelenskyy himself on the eve of the invasion, when he spoke in a very moving speech directly to Russians and told them, I know most of you don't want this war. And then we've seen it even from people like the defense minister, who spoke in a - in a video, in Russian, offering amnesty, offering monetary compensation if Russian soldiers lay down their arms. And they've gotten even just regular soldiers, Ukrainian soldiers and commanders, to kind of post these videos that often go viral because, you know, they have - got a lot of bravado. They're saying - you know, they're giving a lot of threats. There's a lot of the usual kind of wartime messaging. They're set to this dramatic music. But ultimately, these commanders are saying, listen; we know you're young kids. We know you don't want to be here. Go home. You know, and all of this is often being done in Russian, which all of them speak. So it's - I think they're speaking very directly to Russians, trying their very best to break through this digital iron curtain to tell them that their government is lying to them. DAVIES: Right. So these messages that are in Russian language to Russian people, to Russian soldiers and this list you said of captured Russian soldiers, videos of Russian soldiers, they get past the Russian censorship by doing - putting it on Telegram, this encrypted messaging app. Is that right? Yeah. BERGENGRUEN: That's right. Yeah. DAVIES: I also read, I think, that some have found a way to send text messages to Russian troops, who may be using cellphones, instructing them on how to surrender and providing these financial incentives if they bring equipment. There was one guy who supposedly - who actually surrendered a tank, right? BERGENGRUEN: That's right. We've heard so many anecdotes like this because it is clear that many of these young Russian soldiers, many of them are conscripts. They had no idea they were going into Ukraine. And it's been such an ill-planned operation in many senses, you know, in terms of supplies. They're hungry. They're cold. They have no idea what they're doing there. Their vehicles keep breaking down. They're running out of gas. They're lost. And, you know, part of this is what the Ukrainian government wants to put out there. But, you know, I think there's an overwhelming amount of evidence that this is true. And so Ukraine is reaching out directly to them, kind of, you know, telling them, listen. We know - we understand you don't want to be here. We understand you don't want to kill civilians, you know, and offering them alternatives. We have yet to see how effective this is going to be. You know, there have been efforts to offer them Ukrainian citizenship, to offer them amnesty, to offer them, again, money. And we have yet to see how effective this is actually going to be, because obviously it's not an easy thing to lay down your arms or to turn your back on the people you came with. But we do know that it is very appealing to many of them, just given how low morale is among Russian troops. DAVIES: You know, we've mentioned Telegram a few times. This is a messaging app that's become widely used in the war. You want to just explain a bit about what it is and how it works? BERGENGRUEN: It would be really difficult to picture this whole war without Telegram because, you know, unlike Twitter, unlike Facebook, there isn't any moderation. You know, it's just - it's basically the Wild West. It's a free-for-all. It's an app that doesn't - there's no algorithm that decides what you're going to see. And so in this sense, you - the way that it's - the way that it works is you follow different channels. You see them all in order. And some of them can turn off comments, in which case it just becomes a - you know, there's no discussion. It's just a one-way megaphone kind of blasting all this information out. But it's extremely effective because it can't really be moderated. And this is a choice by the app a long time ago. It actually was founded by two brothers - two Russian brothers - who founded another very popular Russian social media network and who ultimately had to leave Russia, but who completely refused to allow censorship. And so it's a very effective tool in this sense because, you know, it allows you to upload large files, large video files, which obviously has been very useful in this particular context. People are using it to document war crimes, to show what's going on in the neighborhoods. It allows you to forward things very quickly. But again, the biggest reason that it's become so popular and so effective has been because it's not moderated. And one of the kind of crazy things for those of us who've covered this space for a long time is that it was the app of choice for terrorists for a very long time - for ISIS, for the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq. We saw them use these apps to organize. We - Telegram was used to plan attacks in Paris and in Berlin. And, you know, back then, it was notorious as kind of the app that was popular with terrorists. And there was a lot of pressure to moderate it, to make sure these people got kicked off. But now, in a kind of strange turn, the very things that made it a liability, that made it very dangerous, the very things that made national security officials from a lot of countries, you know, push the app to shut this down have been the reason that it's been so effective in this war. DAVIES: Has the Russian government tried to shut down Telegram? BERGENGRUEN: They've tried to shut it down in the past unsuccessfully because ultimately - it was kind of funny. Even their - you know, Putin's own spokesman ended up still using it behind the scenes, even when there was kind of a ban in name only on the app, because it's so effective. It's just - people really like using it. It's extremely popular in Russia and in Ukraine. There's kind of a familiarity with it because it was, you know, founded - it was - the owner is Russian, and it's a Russian native app ultimately. But the main reason that they're not shutting it down, according to the analyst I spoke to, is that the Russian government needs Telegram because they've restricted Facebook, they've restricted, you know, Instagram, they've restricted Twitter, they've restricted - they've kind of restricted their own way of getting their message out and of getting Russian state media's message out. So if they were to block Telegram, Ukraine's narrative is the only one that exists. And so they actually, in the months before the war, made a concerted effort to have their main anchors, you know, of Russia Today, of Sputnik, of all of these Russian state media channels, set up their own Telegram channels so that they are a competitor on this app. So they can't - you know, I think one of the main reasons that they can't shut it down is because they need it to get their own message across to Russians, too. DAVIES: You know, in the United States, where social media platforms are criticized for not moderating content and letting disinformation - to run free, Telegram is a place where anybody can put up a channel saying anything. And so you have this wild kind of competing megaphones, and it somehow works. BERGENGRUEN: That's right. I mean, don't get me wrong. It is a cesspool. Those of us who spend a lot of time on Telegram, you know, just know how there's - there's just - it is a complete free-for-all in also a negative way. You know, anyone can post anything. There's absolutely no way to really suppress some content. But again, we are - currently, they are living through a real war. They are horrific - you know, there's horrific violence. There is just so much happening that usually, if they were to post it somewhere like Facebook, would probably be taken down or censored or suppressed. And this is the only way to really get an unfiltered view of the war across. And it's not just to other Ukrainians or to Russians, but it's to the rest of the world. It's giving us a front seat to the most dark, messed-up, horrific aspects of the war. In some ways, I think we all have to admit that might be the only way for an app to be effective in the middle of a war. DAVIES: And in the case of, you know, Russian families who are worried about their friends and family members who are serving in the Russian army, they find these channels that provide information about them - connect to it. And that's an effective way for the Ukrainian digital soldiers to - or the ministry to communicate with them, right? BERGENGRUEN: That's right. And we've seen downloads of Telegram in Russia spike dramatically. And it really seems to indicate that people are starved for news that isn't being shown on these propaganda channels on state media. DAVIES: We need to take another break here. Let me reintroduce you. We are speaking with Vera Bergengruen. She's an investigative correspondent in Time magazine's Washington bureau covering online disinformation and national security. We'll continue our conversation in just a moment. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF THE MOUNTAIN GOATS SONG, \"PEACOCKS\")DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. And we're speaking with Time magazine's investigative correspondent Vera Bergengruen. She's been reporting on Ukraine's success so far in waging digital war in resisting the Russian invasion. You know, a lot of this communication, both by the ministry and by these volunteer citizen IT army that they have recruited, is a matter of communication. It boosts morale in the country. It builds outside support. I'm wondering how much of this effort is devoted to the battlefield itself, assisting Ukrainian military operations? Do you have a sense of that? BERGENGRUEN: We do know that some of the systems that the digital ministry has put in place, which are pretty innovative, like having a telegram bot which usually is used for, for example, PR or for customer service requests, having set up a whole telegram channel, what we call a bot, where someone can report Russian troop movements or strikes on certain targets and then, you know, having that fed back into the military, that's - you know, they're using tools like this in a way that they've never been used before. And in some cases, I think we actually know that they've been effective. The Russian Defense Ministry actually thanked whoever submitted a tip and said we were able to take out this Russian tank thanks to your tip. And so they are able to weaponize some of these digital tools to obviously have an impact outside the digital realm. But I think the real scope of it won't really become clear until a couple of weeks or months from now because so much of what's happening is really behind the scenes. DAVIES: One of the things that the Ukrainian government has done under Zelenskyy, I read, is, you know, it's just digitized a lot more government services, as you said. You know, you can easily pay parking tickets or schedule a COVID test and something. There are apps that are in the hands and on the mobile phones of Ukrainians. Has that assisted them in involving citizens in the digital war? BERGENGRUEN: All of this infrastructure and all of these apps that they developed before the war have been weaponized now on behalf of this digital battlefield. And one of the ways that this has happened has been turning these apps that most citizens have on their phones, like we said, to schedule, you know, appointments, to pay a parking ticket, in order to give them crucial information about the war. So they're able to see Russian troop movements, even. They're able to get a notification that alerts them when there's - you know, when the air raid sirens are going off. They're able to see maps of bomb shelters. They're able to see where they might be able to find medical supplies or Wi-Fi. And all of this happened really quickly because they knew that, thanks to their efforts in the previous three years under Zelenskyy's administration, most - many Ukrainians in major cities had all these apps already on their phones and also, like you mentioned, because of the pandemic. So they're able to just kind of go straight - you know, have straight access into hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian smartphones and provide them with really critical information and potentially lifesaving advice. And one of the other senses that this has been very useful for them has been by insisting on digitizing a lot of documents. I mean, Ukrainians who are fleeing their homes, who had, you know, their homes bombed by Russia, they're able to access their passports or other documents through their phone. They're able to apply for relocation funds. And so all of this, you know, is obviously a whole different front of this war in the digital realm because they're able to just directly communicate with Ukrainians. DAVIES: You know, there have been reports of communications among Russian troops leaking, allowing Ukrainians to track and attack them in some cases. I think Fedorov said something to you that - about, you know, Ukraine might win this war through tech, through digital means. Is Russia showing itself to be a step behind here in all of this? BERGENGRUEN: Well, that's what the - Ukraine's digital minister seemed to think, right? Fedorov told me, you know, Russia is operating in the 20th century. They are basically applying a Cold War mentality to new technology. And that's not how you win this war. And he said, we are going to win because we are building all our efforts like a tech company. And he's very insistent on that. He says, we are operating like a tech company. This is the way of the future. And Russia's just not keeping up. And in some senses, you know, that might be true. I think Russia is overestimating how much their playbook of just causing chaos online or causing, you know, just kind of really blunt attacks are going to be effective because Ukraine has shown so far that they're able to beat Russia at its own game by kind of predicting what they're going to do and just - honestly, just being better at the messaging war. I know it gets kind of tiring to say it. It seems kind of silly and frivolous to be focusing on social media when we're seeing, you know, that so many people are dying in this horrific war. But that is how so much of this is ultimately happening. That is how world support is being galvanized. That is how Russia is finding itself completely, you know, economically isolated and isolated digitally. And so I think by not only using these tools better, by building their operations the way that - the way that Ukraine is running its own war is, according to Fedorov, built more like a tech company than what he called a rigid war tank, which is how he described Russia. DAVIES: Well, Vera Bergengruen, thank you so much for speaking with us. BERGENGRUEN: Thanks so much, Dave. DAVIES: Vera Bergengruen is an investigative correspondent in Time's Washington bureau covering online disinformation and national security. Coming up, John Powers reviews \"Slow Horses,\" the new six-part spy thriller series on Apple TV+ starring Gary Oldman. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF THE BAD PLUS' \"THE BEAUTIFUL ONES\") DAVE DAVIES, HOST:   This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies, in for Terry Gross, who's off this week. One constant theme of reporting on the Russian invasion of Ukraine is surprise at and admiration for the Ukrainian military's effectiveness in fighting Russian troops. Our guest today, Time magazine correspondent Vera Bergengruen reports that Ukraine has also been successful in waging war on the digital battlefield. A key figure in the country's efforts is its 31-year-old Minister of Digital Transformation Mykhailo Fedorov, a man who'd previously run digital communications in Volodymyr Zelenskyy's successful presidential campaign. Bergengruen writes that Fedorov's ministry is inventing a whole new way to fight a war online. They've recruited thousands of citizen volunteers in efforts to undermine Russian disinformation campaigns. They've shored up international support and gotten tech companies to block services in Russia. And their social media campaign of videos with President Zelenskyy has united and lifted the morale of Ukrainians. Vera Bergengruen previously reported for the Miami Herald, BuzzFeed News and the McClatchy newspaper's Washington Bureau, where she worked on the Pulitzer Prize-winning Panama Papers investigation. She's now an investigative correspondent in Time's Washington bureau covering online disinformation and national security. Well, Vera Bergengruen, welcome to FRESH AIR. VERA BERGENGRUEN: Thank you for having me. DAVIES: A key figure in this fascinating story is this 31-year-old guy named Mykhailo Fedorov. Tell us about him. BERGENGRUEN: One of the first things that struck me about Fedorov when I talked to him via video chat is just how young he is. He is the youngest member of Zelenskyy's cabinet. He's only 31. He ran his campaign back in 2019 to become president. And he clearly is just kind of a young techie guy who now kind of finds himself in the front line of this digital battle. And we spoke for - he was at an undisclosed location within Kyiv. And he was telling me all about his efforts to basically repurpose all of these digital tools that he spent years developing to fight a modern war. And he himself seemed to kind of think that it was crazy that he found himself in this situation. But ultimately, it's clearly very effective. He's been able to take all of these ambitious efforts - you know, reaching out to Silicon Valley, trying to work - you know, their ambition is always to partner with Apple, with Google, with all of these tech giants that they admire in Ukraine, to do all of these kind of mundane bureaucratic projects. And then they turned it all around to help their country fight a war. DAVIES: Of course, a big part of this is communication. I mean, it's - you're an advocate, and your audience is people abroad. It's people in Ukraine. It's people everywhere. Let's talk about some of the content that's been posted on social media in support of the Ukrainian resistance. Tell us about how they've built morale and united the country in this effort. What kinds of material have they been putting up? BERGENGRUEN: It's been a mix of kind of what we would call standard war propaganda in the sense that all war content is often propaganda. So we've seen so many tales of heroism. You know, there was the mythical ghost of Kyiv who was, you know, allegedly a fighter pilot who was taking out all of these, you know, Russian targets. You know, we don't think he's real. But there's been all of these kind of war stories that have really galvanized people behind them. But so many of them have been real. So many of them have been really galvanizing messages. You know, there was Zelenskyy himself, who's such an inspiring figure for many Ukrainians and for people abroad, and he just very naturally, you know, his - given that his background is as an actor, as a comedian, he naturally stepped into this role and almost seemed to have all these ready one-liners that immediately went viral. You know, his famous line, I don't - you know, I need more ammunition; I don't need a ride - when they offered to get him out of Kyiv. We've got Ukrainians themselves, you know - there was - early in the war, there was this old woman who came up to a Russian soldier and told him to take sunflower seeds in his pocket, so when he died on Ukrainian soil, at least flowers would bloom. And there's all these moments kind of captured on camera and immediately making their way around the globe that have done the work of the Ukrainian government for them, in many senses, to really get the message out there, to show resilience, to show resistance. But a lot of this doesn't just happen by magic. It's not that it's not real. But the Ukrainian government is relying on a lot of digital savvy, a lot of existing infrastructure, to make sure that all of this information gets out into the world. So, for example, one of the ways that I think they've been very effective is their digital ministers told me that Ukrainians actually don't really use Twitter as much as we do here, you know, especially the government. You know, they use it, but it's not as popular an app. They use other apps. But they know that people in the United States and in Western Europe are obsessed with Twitter. We're on it all the time. So what they did is, you know, they went on Twitter. They made sure that everything that they would usually put out through other mechanisms is on this app in order to reach their target audience, which is mainly people abroad. So in other words, they've really been able to collect all of these examples of resistance, of resilience, of heroism, which are, you know, often, obviously, real stories. But they're relying on a lot of digital know-how in order to make sure that they reach the target audience. DAVIES: You know, it's easy to forget that in the early days of the war, there was a wide expectation that the Russians would quickly take Kyiv, and people might have been expecting President Zelenskyy to, you know, leave and form a government in exile. The fact that he's stayed there and continued to make these videos saying, we are here, we're not going anywhere, we're fighting - that was pretty inspirational, wasn't it? BERGENGRUEN: It was. And it's the thing that brought much of the world to Ukraine's side because, you know, when you try to imagine someone beside Zelenskyy or maybe someone who did leave or maybe someone who stayed but chose not to be so public, chose not to film these truly unprecedented videos of themself, you know, a world leader filming himself, you know, on the selfie mode on his smartphone, walking around Kyiv and giving these - you know, these messages to his people, you know, I think it's fair to say that a lot of the world, which is - ultimately, unfortunately, care less about what's happening in Ukraine. He's a very effective spokesman. And, you know, again, in the early days of the war, so much of the world support hinged on Zelenskyy's messages both to the world through social media, to world leaders and to parliaments and to Congress. He did every single thing he could to get the message out there. But the style in which he did it is just so perfectly made for 2022. It's bite-sized. It's on video. He's wearing this, you know, olive T-shirt. He's not wearing a - when he's speaking - even when he's speaking to - you know, to the world governments, to world leaders, he's not wearing a suit. He's in the streets of Kyiv kind of filming himself. And all of this is just made kind of for maximum effect to really get the direness of the situation across. DAVIES: I know there are updates on what's happening in the war that come along in a lot of these social media posts. The other thing, you know, is that, you know, the Russians are famously effective at disinformation. And you write that one of the things that Mykhailo Fedorov and the ministry have done is to blunt these efforts at disinformation, not just debunking them but pre-bunking them - that is to say, getting out ahead of the message. Give us an example of this. BERGENGRUEN: Right. And this is something that I think Russia didn't really anticipate because they are masters of kind of chaos. We - you know, Dave, it's interesting. I feel like we all, you know, in the United States, in Europe, especially after 2016, had this impression of the Russians as master social media manipulators. Like, we don't really know what they're doing. They get in there, and we just can't prevent them from manipulating all of us. But ultimately, all these experts and analysts I speak with say that they're kind of unsophisticated when it comes to social media. And what they really do is flood the zone with so much information that people don't really know what to believe. And in this case, Ukrainians were able to get ahead of it. We have to remember that Ukraine is very familiar with Russian tactics, much more than even we are in the United States, because they've been at the receiving end of it for years and years, and they've been at war with, you know, in parts of Ukraine with Russia for a long time. So they know that one of the most effective ways to get ahead of it is to not allow these disinformation narratives to take root at all. So, for example, when rumors started circulating that Zelenskyy has fled, they immediately put him on camera. I think he even held up his phone while someone filmed them to show the date. So they knew that this was a, you know, a correct video and that it was accurate. And he shows himself and says, you know, I haven't fled. In another case, they warned people ahead of time that there were going to be rumors that Ukrainian soldiers were laying down their arms, that they were surrendering to Russia early in the war. And even before Russia was able to fully blast this one-way megaphone of disinformation out there, before it could take root, they warned people about it, and it wasn't really effective. Instead of trying to fact-check it, it just ended up prebunking it, which meant it couldn't even take root. People knew about this narrative before they even heard about it. And it just ultimately ended up being ineffective. DAVIES: One of the things you've written is that the Ukrainian Ministry of Digital Transformation has recruited regular citizens for this effort, up to 300,000. Is this right, kind of citizen volunteers in this - what you refer to as an IT army? BERGENGRUEN: Yeah, this is actually Fedorov's words, an IT army, a tech army. And he's very proud of it. And it is - I have seen it. It's 300,000 people on the messaging app Telegram who are all - many of them are drawn from Ukraine's kind of entrepreneurialism tech class. They're people who worked at tech companies, who had startups, who are cybersecurity experts, and many of them are just ordinary citizens who raised their hands. They all only get there by being vouched for by other experts. So they say that it's a pretty, you know, select group. But these are all people who are basically volunteering to use their digital skills in a range of different ways in order to either protect Ukraine's digital efforts from Russian attacks - and, again, they are very familiar with Russian attacks after eight years of this - or to actually attack Russian infrastructure or digital assets themselves. DAVIES: You know, when we talk about an army, you know, armies - that is to say traditional armies - they recruit people. So they vet people. Not anybody - just anybody gets to come in. There's training. And there's a command structure, so that in theory, you have an idea of who's in your army, and you know they'll follow orders. To what extent does that model follow this IT army, or are they more like a guerrilla force that's out there? How does it work? What do they do? BERGENGRUEN: From my perspective here, it does seem more like a guerrilla force. It seems like a lot of very smart techie people who know exactly how to use - you know, they basically give it a list of targets, and they go after them. But, you know, it is impressive when you speak to Fedorov, when you speak to other people inside the Digital Transformation Ministry. And they are ultimately more than 650 people who work for it. And they definitely are - before the war were pretty bureaucratic. They had different offices. They have different command structures. And they had a lot of very ambitious projects. And they've pulled people from all those projects to moderate this group, to give them lists of targets, to kind of see where it's going. But you can obviously tell that in the chaos of the war - and again, we have to remember these people are living through it themselves. Some of them are out of the country, but most of them are there. And obviously, a lot of things kind of fall through the cracks. You know, at one point, I asked him how many letters he had actually sent to tech companies or how many targets they had given this group. And they didn't even, you know, they don't have a full number. It's obviously rather decentralized. But at the same time, so far, it seems pretty effective. And if anything, what this does is, especially organizing through apps like Telegram - it means that when things come up, when things change, when Russia launches a new attack, they've got a ready-made group of people who are already alert and kind of mobilized to respond. DAVIES: You know, there's an old saying that the first casualty in war is the truth. You know, governments lie and spin to gain advantage, as do, you know, combatants and armies. And you write that in this case, this digital effort, that the leader here, Mykhailo Fedorov, monitors Ukrainian messaging for any disinformation. What does he say about this? Why is this important? BERGENGRUEN: It was really interesting speaking to him about this because, in many ways, a lot of these young Ukrainian digital ministers use the language of Silicon Valley. They use the language of, you know, American tech as well. Or they basically say - the way he phrased it to me was we are protecting our brand. Our brand is one of an honest people that are being attacked. It's a black-and-white war. And we have to completely have transparency and clarity about what is happening. We can't afford to mess up. We can't afford to be broadcasting our own disinformation because that will muddy the waters, and that will start putting us closer to the same level as Russia. And that is a really real fear with them. And so what they do, according to what Fedorov told me, is, you know, they've got several teams set up that vet every single message that Zelenskyy or, you know, other digital ministers and regular ministers put out. They get the information in it. They make sure that it's accurate. They make sure that they're not really putting out videos out of context and things that could be misunderstood. So that doesn't obviously stop them from engaging in regular war propaganda, which is amplifying tales of, again, resistance, heroism. You know, those kind of things are still out there. But they want to make sure that they can't really put anything out there that Russia can then turn against them and prove Russia's false allegations that the Ukrainians are lying about the war itself. So I thought it was really interesting that he framed it as we are protecting our brand. Our brand is Ukraine is the attacked nation, the wronged nation. And we are the ones who speak the truth. DAVIES: We need to take a break here. Let me reintroduce you. We are speaking with Vera Bergengruen. She's an investigative correspondent in Time's Washington bureau covering online disinformation and national security. She'll be back to talk more after this short break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF CUONG VU AND PAT METHENY'S \"SEEDS OF DOUBT\") DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. We're speaking with TIME investigative correspondent Vera Bergengruen. She's been reporting on Ukraine's success so far in waging digital war and resisting the Russian invasion. One of the things that the digital information ministry in Ukraine has focused on is getting big tech companies, particularly American tech companies, to enforce a digital blockade of Russia. How has this gone? BERGENGRUEN: Ukraine's digital ministry has been kind of shockingly effective at how quickly they've been able to get big tech giants to, you know, give in to some of their demands. And one of the reasons is that they are obviously very effective at social media itself. They've got people like Fedorov, the digital minister, or Zelenskyy himself directly tagging - you know, connecting to big tech companies - to Facebook, to Google, to Apple - on social media, on Twitter, kind of connecting them to the war crimes - to what they say are war crimes happening in Ukraine. They're saying, listen. Look at how your technology is being used by Russia. Every single dollar that goes towards the Russian government is being used for this war. And they've been, you know, very effective at this. And just by tagging some of these companies, they've been able to immediately get a response, which is pretty surprising, at least from the outside. When you speak to them on the inside, they acknowledge that they've been in talks with these companies for a while, that they're pushing them, and that by the time they send out that tweet, they've already kind of, you know, often talked to them behind the scenes and really, you know, sent them personal letters and tried to push them to do the right thing, in their words. DAVIES: So there's an inside game - personal - private negotiations, but they're not beyond shaming them publicly if they need to. BERGENGRUEN: Right. And the public shaming, I mean, I think it's hard to overstate how effective it's been because, again - you know, for example, they're not usually that active on Twitter, but they took to Twitter because they know that is the way that hundreds of thousands of people around the world are going to amplify their message. And, you know, these companies that usually take a very long time to take any kind of action moved extremely quickly by their own standards. You know, they've banned Russian outlets in Europe in many apps. They, you know, really quickly suspended Apple Pay in Russia. They basically ended up pulling so many of these services that ordinary Russian citizens rely on very, very quickly out of Russia. And this was almost - I mean, I think it's fair to say a lot of the credit goes to the public shaming that Fedorov and these digital ministers immediately started doing when the invasion began. DAVIES: It was also interesting - you know, the digital ministry, for its efforts, needs to have its citizen digital soldiers connected to the internet, which is not easy given, you know, the ferocity of the Russian bombing and missile campaign. And one of the things you wrote about is that Elon Musk sent out - what? - several trucks to connect Ukrainians with his Starlink satellite-based internet service, right? Was this significant? How did this happen? BERGENGRUEN: This is one of those things that, from the outside, looked almost shockingly, stunningly fast because we saw Fedorov send a tweet asking Elon Musk for help. And less than 48 hours later, he tweeted a photo showing, you know, a truck full of these Starlink satellite connectors. And it was pretty - you know, from the outside, it's kind of crazy that they were able to send that to Ukraine so quickly. When I spoke with him, you know, he acknowledged that he had been in talks with them for a while and that when they actually knew that it might happen, they were able to kind of put that on the outside. But, you know, it has been effective. They've - some of these have been able to connect a lot of Ukrainians, you know, to the internet. One of the ministers I spoke with actually spoke with me through this Starlink connection that he had set up. And, you know, that's just an really easy way for people like Musk to make a pretty big difference because without the internet, all of these things that we've been talking about obviously are impossible. DAVIES: Let me reintroduce you again. We're going to take another break. Vera Bergengruen is an investigative correspondent in TIME magazine's Washington bureau covering online disinformation and national security. She'll be back to talk more after this short break. I'm Dave Davies, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF GUILLERMO KLEIN'S \"MELODIA DE ARRABAL\") DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies, in for Terry Gross, who's off this week. We're speaking with Vera Bergengruen, an investigative correspondent in Time magazine's Washington bureau covering online disinformation and national security. She's written recently about Ukraine's efforts to wage digital war in its resistance to the Russian invasion, an effort headed by its 31-year-old minister of digital transformation, who'd previously run digital operations on Vladimir Zelenskyy's 2019 presidential campaign. You know, you told us about this massive IT army, this - these citizen volunteers that are involved in this digital effort. Can you give us a little more sense of what they do? BERGENGRUEN: So even though it's described as an IT army and we think of them as hackers and people - you know, techie people just kind of going after these targets, it's much broader than that. One really interesting effort has been that they've recruited influential, you know, Instagram influencers. They've recruited people who have millions of followers. And, you know, think of people who post about skin care or models or, you know, people who post about their kids or schools, things like that, especially young women. They've recruited over 200 of them in a separate Telegram channel, and they coordinate them to broadcast the message that they want. So think of 200 social media celebrities who are just being told, today we're going to talk about this. Or, you know, this thing that you're hearing about the bombing of this hospital is really important; we want you to talk to your followers about that. And these are people who, again, have millions of followers. And that is, I think, an underappreciated part of this. It's not just going after Russian targets or someone sitting in a dark room trying to hack into a Russian government system; it's a much more public-facing effort in terms of having a lot of these - again, imagine, you know, there's a model with 2 million followers who will go on Instagram and talk about, you know, what's happening on the ground in Ukraine or how she's being personally affected by it. And that is something that I think we're really underestimating in terms of its power. And another way that they're using this IT army, for example, is to organize systems where they can recruit even more volunteers. So they're recruiting volunteers both, like we said, in terms of cyber experts but also, for example, foreign fighters. They are using Telegram in order to put out calls for foreign fighters to come into Ukraine to help fight with the Ukrainian army. And all of this is being coordinated by the digital ministry. So this kind of - this digital army, this IT army, is truly much broader than those very talented hackers who we know are going after Russian targets. DAVIES: Who is Stepan, the Instagram cat? BERGENGRUEN: (Laughter) Stepan is a Ukrainian cat whose owner set up an account last year on Instagram and TikTok and just shared funny photos of her cat, who's just very comical. So people really love following this cat. I mean, Britney Spears was one of this cat's followers. And then when the war started, suddenly these accounts took a very somber turn and started posting updates about the war. And, you know, through this, actually, the owner has been able to raise some money to help Ukrainians, I think a pretty significant amount. But I think it speaks to a much bigger thing, which is many of us didn't even realize how many Ukrainians we were following. I mean, this happened not just with this Instagram-famous cat and TikTok-famous cat, but, you know, there's just a lot of content creators on social media who suddenly went dark or who suddenly started reporting from bomb shelters, when usually they were, you know, posting skin care tips or, you know, some other kind of content. And I think that has been one of the most effective tools as well in order to raise awareness and galvanize support for Ukraine because, ultimately, this is just something that a lot of people relate to. And I think, you know, people like this cat - well, not people (laughter). Accounts like this cat end up really reaching people who usually might not be tuned in to this war. DAVIES: To what extent does the does the ministry, does this digital effort, try to appeal to Russian soldiers or their families? BERGENGRUEN: Appealing directly to Russians has been a really big part of these efforts. And you can tell because they often speak in Russian, and they will make a point of it. So one of the biggest efforts has been a website and a Telegram channel that were set up in order to identify prisoners of war. So they want Russians, who often - you know, there's this digital iron curtain that's preventing them from knowing much of what's happening. They're not reading or watching the same news that we are. They're not really seeing, you know, the carnage in Ukraine. And so one of the things that they did is they set up a Telegram channel - because this app is not blocked in Russia - and setting up a website where they just post videos and photos of prisoners of war, of young Russians usually, and they have them identify themselves, and then they try to blast that one way over the border so that people can kind of find, you know, their loved ones. And we know, anecdotally, that that's been very effective. You know, there's a lot of stories of mothers, of - you know, of families, of friends, sending each other these photos, saying, you know, oh, my God, that's my brother. You know, what's he doing in Ukraine? And it's been very effective to speak directly to Russians. But in terms of the digital ministry, they often just make sure that they put their government officials, their most high-ranking officials, on camera, speaking in Russian directly to Russians. We saw this very effectively, I think, with Zelenskyy himself on the eve of the invasion, when he spoke in a very moving speech directly to Russians and told them, I know most of you don't want this war. And then we've seen it even from people like the defense minister, who spoke in a - in a video, in Russian, offering amnesty, offering monetary compensation if Russian soldiers lay down their arms. And they've gotten even just regular soldiers, Ukrainian soldiers and commanders, to kind of post these videos that often go viral because, you know, they have - got a lot of bravado. They're saying - you know, they're giving a lot of threats. There's a lot of the usual kind of wartime messaging. They're set to this dramatic music. But ultimately, these commanders are saying, listen; we know you're young kids. We know you don't want to be here. Go home. You know, and all of this is often being done in Russian, which all of them speak. So it's - I think they're speaking very directly to Russians, trying their very best to break through this digital iron curtain to tell them that their government is lying to them. DAVIES: Right. So these messages that are in Russian language to Russian people, to Russian soldiers and this list you said of captured Russian soldiers, videos of Russian soldiers, they get past the Russian censorship by doing - putting it on Telegram, this encrypted messaging app. Is that right? Yeah. BERGENGRUEN: That's right. Yeah. DAVIES: I also read, I think, that some have found a way to send text messages to Russian troops, who may be using cellphones, instructing them on how to surrender and providing these financial incentives if they bring equipment. There was one guy who supposedly - who actually surrendered a tank, right? BERGENGRUEN: That's right. We've heard so many anecdotes like this because it is clear that many of these young Russian soldiers, many of them are conscripts. They had no idea they were going into Ukraine. And it's been such an ill-planned operation in many senses, you know, in terms of supplies. They're hungry. They're cold. They have no idea what they're doing there. Their vehicles keep breaking down. They're running out of gas. They're lost. And, you know, part of this is what the Ukrainian government wants to put out there. But, you know, I think there's an overwhelming amount of evidence that this is true. And so Ukraine is reaching out directly to them, kind of, you know, telling them, listen. We know - we understand you don't want to be here. We understand you don't want to kill civilians, you know, and offering them alternatives. We have yet to see how effective this is going to be. You know, there have been efforts to offer them Ukrainian citizenship, to offer them amnesty, to offer them, again, money. And we have yet to see how effective this is actually going to be, because obviously it's not an easy thing to lay down your arms or to turn your back on the people you came with. But we do know that it is very appealing to many of them, just given how low morale is among Russian troops. DAVIES: You know, we've mentioned Telegram a few times. This is a messaging app that's become widely used in the war. You want to just explain a bit about what it is and how it works? BERGENGRUEN: It would be really difficult to picture this whole war without Telegram because, you know, unlike Twitter, unlike Facebook, there isn't any moderation. You know, it's just - it's basically the Wild West. It's a free-for-all. It's an app that doesn't - there's no algorithm that decides what you're going to see. And so in this sense, you - the way that it's - the way that it works is you follow different channels. You see them all in order. And some of them can turn off comments, in which case it just becomes a - you know, there's no discussion. It's just a one-way megaphone kind of blasting all this information out. But it's extremely effective because it can't really be moderated. And this is a choice by the app a long time ago. It actually was founded by two brothers - two Russian brothers - who founded another very popular Russian social media network and who ultimately had to leave Russia, but who completely refused to allow censorship. And so it's a very effective tool in this sense because, you know, it allows you to upload large files, large video files, which obviously has been very useful in this particular context. People are using it to document war crimes, to show what's going on in the neighborhoods. It allows you to forward things very quickly. But again, the biggest reason that it's become so popular and so effective has been because it's not moderated. And one of the kind of crazy things for those of us who've covered this space for a long time is that it was the app of choice for terrorists for a very long time - for ISIS, for the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq. We saw them use these apps to organize. We - Telegram was used to plan attacks in Paris and in Berlin. And, you know, back then, it was notorious as kind of the app that was popular with terrorists. And there was a lot of pressure to moderate it, to make sure these people got kicked off. But now, in a kind of strange turn, the very things that made it a liability, that made it very dangerous, the very things that made national security officials from a lot of countries, you know, push the app to shut this down have been the reason that it's been so effective in this war. DAVIES: Has the Russian government tried to shut down Telegram? BERGENGRUEN: They've tried to shut it down in the past unsuccessfully because ultimately - it was kind of funny. Even their - you know, Putin's own spokesman ended up still using it behind the scenes, even when there was kind of a ban in name only on the app, because it's so effective. It's just - people really like using it. It's extremely popular in Russia and in Ukraine. There's kind of a familiarity with it because it was, you know, founded - it was - the owner is Russian, and it's a Russian native app ultimately. But the main reason that they're not shutting it down, according to the analyst I spoke to, is that the Russian government needs Telegram because they've restricted Facebook, they've restricted, you know, Instagram, they've restricted Twitter, they've restricted - they've kind of restricted their own way of getting their message out and of getting Russian state media's message out. So if they were to block Telegram, Ukraine's narrative is the only one that exists. And so they actually, in the months before the war, made a concerted effort to have their main anchors, you know, of Russia Today, of Sputnik, of all of these Russian state media channels, set up their own Telegram channels so that they are a competitor on this app. So they can't - you know, I think one of the main reasons that they can't shut it down is because they need it to get their own message across to Russians, too. DAVIES: You know, in the United States, where social media platforms are criticized for not moderating content and letting disinformation - to run free, Telegram is a place where anybody can put up a channel saying anything. And so you have this wild kind of competing megaphones, and it somehow works. BERGENGRUEN: That's right. I mean, don't get me wrong. It is a cesspool. Those of us who spend a lot of time on Telegram, you know, just know how there's - there's just - it is a complete free-for-all in also a negative way. You know, anyone can post anything. There's absolutely no way to really suppress some content. But again, we are - currently, they are living through a real war. They are horrific - you know, there's horrific violence. There is just so much happening that usually, if they were to post it somewhere like Facebook, would probably be taken down or censored or suppressed. And this is the only way to really get an unfiltered view of the war across. And it's not just to other Ukrainians or to Russians, but it's to the rest of the world. It's giving us a front seat to the most dark, messed-up, horrific aspects of the war. In some ways, I think we all have to admit that might be the only way for an app to be effective in the middle of a war. DAVIES: And in the case of, you know, Russian families who are worried about their friends and family members who are serving in the Russian army, they find these channels that provide information about them - connect to it. And that's an effective way for the Ukrainian digital soldiers to - or the ministry to communicate with them, right? BERGENGRUEN: That's right. And we've seen downloads of Telegram in Russia spike dramatically. And it really seems to indicate that people are starved for news that isn't being shown on these propaganda channels on state media. DAVIES: We need to take another break here. Let me reintroduce you. We are speaking with Vera Bergengruen. She's an investigative correspondent in Time magazine's Washington bureau covering online disinformation and national security. We'll continue our conversation in just a moment. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF THE MOUNTAIN GOATS SONG, \"PEACOCKS\") DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. And we're speaking with Time magazine's investigative correspondent Vera Bergengruen. She's been reporting on Ukraine's success so far in waging digital war in resisting the Russian invasion. You know, a lot of this communication, both by the ministry and by these volunteer citizen IT army that they have recruited, is a matter of communication. It boosts morale in the country. It builds outside support. I'm wondering how much of this effort is devoted to the battlefield itself, assisting Ukrainian military operations? Do you have a sense of that? BERGENGRUEN: We do know that some of the systems that the digital ministry has put in place, which are pretty innovative, like having a telegram bot which usually is used for, for example, PR or for customer service requests, having set up a whole telegram channel, what we call a bot, where someone can report Russian troop movements or strikes on certain targets and then, you know, having that fed back into the military, that's - you know, they're using tools like this in a way that they've never been used before. And in some cases, I think we actually know that they've been effective. The Russian Defense Ministry actually thanked whoever submitted a tip and said we were able to take out this Russian tank thanks to your tip. And so they are able to weaponize some of these digital tools to obviously have an impact outside the digital realm. But I think the real scope of it won't really become clear until a couple of weeks or months from now because so much of what's happening is really behind the scenes. DAVIES: One of the things that the Ukrainian government has done under Zelenskyy, I read, is, you know, it's just digitized a lot more government services, as you said. You know, you can easily pay parking tickets or schedule a COVID test and something. There are apps that are in the hands and on the mobile phones of Ukrainians. Has that assisted them in involving citizens in the digital war? BERGENGRUEN: All of this infrastructure and all of these apps that they developed before the war have been weaponized now on behalf of this digital battlefield. And one of the ways that this has happened has been turning these apps that most citizens have on their phones, like we said, to schedule, you know, appointments, to pay a parking ticket, in order to give them crucial information about the war. So they're able to see Russian troop movements, even. They're able to get a notification that alerts them when there's - you know, when the air raid sirens are going off. They're able to see maps of bomb shelters. They're able to see where they might be able to find medical supplies or Wi-Fi. And all of this happened really quickly because they knew that, thanks to their efforts in the previous three years under Zelenskyy's administration, most - many Ukrainians in major cities had all these apps already on their phones and also, like you mentioned, because of the pandemic. So they're able to just kind of go straight - you know, have straight access into hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian smartphones and provide them with really critical information and potentially lifesaving advice. And one of the other senses that this has been very useful for them has been by insisting on digitizing a lot of documents. I mean, Ukrainians who are fleeing their homes, who had, you know, their homes bombed by Russia, they're able to access their passports or other documents through their phone. They're able to apply for relocation funds. And so all of this, you know, is obviously a whole different front of this war in the digital realm because they're able to just directly communicate with Ukrainians. DAVIES: You know, there have been reports of communications among Russian troops leaking, allowing Ukrainians to track and attack them in some cases. I think Fedorov said something to you that - about, you know, Ukraine might win this war through tech, through digital means. Is Russia showing itself to be a step behind here in all of this? BERGENGRUEN: Well, that's what the - Ukraine's digital minister seemed to think, right? Fedorov told me, you know, Russia is operating in the 20th century. They are basically applying a Cold War mentality to new technology. And that's not how you win this war. And he said, we are going to win because we are building all our efforts like a tech company. And he's very insistent on that. He says, we are operating like a tech company. This is the way of the future. And Russia's just not keeping up. And in some senses, you know, that might be true. I think Russia is overestimating how much their playbook of just causing chaos online or causing, you know, just kind of really blunt attacks are going to be effective because Ukraine has shown so far that they're able to beat Russia at its own game by kind of predicting what they're going to do and just - honestly, just being better at the messaging war. I know it gets kind of tiring to say it. It seems kind of silly and frivolous to be focusing on social media when we're seeing, you know, that so many people are dying in this horrific war. But that is how so much of this is ultimately happening. That is how world support is being galvanized. That is how Russia is finding itself completely, you know, economically isolated and isolated digitally. And so I think by not only using these tools better, by building their operations the way that - the way that Ukraine is running its own war is, according to Fedorov, built more like a tech company than what he called a rigid war tank, which is how he described Russia. DAVIES: Well, Vera Bergengruen, thank you so much for speaking with us. BERGENGRUEN: Thanks so much, Dave. DAVIES: Vera Bergengruen is an investigative correspondent in Time's Washington bureau covering online disinformation and national security.

Well, it depends in large part on what independent media they're able to access - access the Russian government has been forcefully trying to restrict. So many Russians have been relying on VPNs - virtual private networks - that obscure their identity online and allow them to access blocked websites. Andy Yen is the founder and CEO of ProtonVPN and also of Proton, the encrypted email service. He joins me now from Geneva, Switzerland. Hi. ANDY YEN: Thanks for having me on the show today. RASCOE: Could you just start by giving us your simplest explanation of how a VPN works? YEN: Well, what a VPN is doing is it's essentially encrypting your internet connection and establishing a new connection from what appears to be a different location. So in the situation when you have censorship, like today in Russia, what a VPN does is it creates an encrypted tunnel or connection to a server outside of Russia. And that network and that server outside of Russia doesn't face censorship. And through there, you're able to access information, resources that are maybe blocked in the country that you're actually based in. RASCOE: And so how has use of your products changed since the beginning of the war? YEN: Well, VPNs have many purposes. And, you know, a lot of it is actually security and privacy. So even before the start of the war, in fact, there were VPN users in Russia, just like there's VPN users in the U. S. and in Europe and in any other country. But VPNs also have the added advantage of being a very effective tool for, you know, bypassing censorship in certain situations. And what we have seen in Russia is actually a tenfold increase. So the usage of ProtonVPN VPN has gone up by about 1,000% since the beginning of the war. RASCOE: Wow. I mean, do you have any sense of what websites people are trying to access? Sure, you - there may be people trying to get information that Russia has blocked, but people may also just be trying to get on social media like Instagram and places like that just to post pictures, right? YEN: Well, Proton is a privacy-focused VPN. And because of that, we are not actually monitoring and, you know, looking at what our users are, you know, viewing. But we do know that today, you know, most Western social media sites have been blocked. Almost all independent news websites have been blocked. So given the fact that we see such a big increase in demand, it's probably driven by, you know, one of those two factors or maybe both of them. RASCOE: Now, on on the one hand, it would sound like this is great for business. On the other hand, you know, we know that there have been sweeping financial sanctions that have made it harder for foreign companies to operate in Russia and for Russians to pay for services. So what has that environment meant for Proton? YEN: Well, there is no means for Russian consumers to pay for services in the West. You know, credit cards are not working. PayPal is not working. Even SWIFT payments for bank transfers are not working. And in this situation, Western tech companies really have two choices, right? One is you can pull out of the country and stop serving customers because you can't make money from it anymore. And this is indeed the path that most businesses have taken. If you want to stay in the country, all you can really do is offer your services for free. So today, the people in Russia that are using Proton services - whether it's ProtonMail Mail or ProtonVPN - - even if they have invoices that are due, we're simply not charging them and waiving the fees because that's the only way in which we can, you know, maintain services for them. RASCOE: But will you be able to keep that up long term? Because, you know, it doesn't seem like this conflict is going to end any time soon. YEN: Yes. Well, we are clearly, of course, losing money today on every single Russian user because there's no means for them to pay us. But I think we have, really, a strong moral obligation to be in there and be present and, you know, provide freedom of information in Russia for as long as possible. RASCOE: For years now, Russia has been trying to restrict the use of VPNs. And in recent weeks, the Russian government, you know, has criminalized speech that runs contrary to their propaganda about the war in Ukraine. What should VPN users be thinking about when they log in? Like, how safe are they? YEN: Even today in - you know, in Russia, there isn't really a track record of people being imprisoned for using a VPN. In fact, usage of a VPN by consumers is not actually illegal. So the main concern I think consumers, you know, in Russia and outside of Russia need to be aware of when picking a VPN is really that, you know, not all VPNs are created equal. Especially today in Russia, where it's mostly free VPNs, the issue that I see quite often is many free VPNs, you know, have business models that are not actually pro-privacy. So what these VPNs are doing is they're actually monitoring, tracking - you know, collecting user information and then reselling that. It's also very hard to identify who is actually owning and running some of these VPNs. So when you're using a VPN, you're essentially trusting that company to, you know, have access to your most sensitive internet browsing activity if they wanted to. And that's why it's very important to choose the right one. RASCOE: That's Andy Yen, CEO of ProtonVPN. Thanks very much. YEN: Yes, thanks for having me.

By the late 1890s, sliding a wax cylinder onto a Thomas Edison phonograph was the way that people listened to commercial music. It was also a way they could record themselves. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Today is June the 24th, a day before Roy's (ph) birthday. MARTIN: Thousands of these live in public collections. NPR's Jennifer Vanasco was in Manhattan when a machine arrived to play recordings that may not have been heard in a century. JENNIFER VANASCO, BYLINE: Deep in the basement of the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts, there's a new machine about the size of a small suitcase. It has two screens, an intimidating number of buttons and dials, a laser and an arm holding a stylus, like the kind of needle that plays records on a turntable. It's called the Endpoint Cylinder and Dictabelt Machine. And we're going to hear audio that no one else has heard likely since around the turn of the last century. And a lot of times, no one even knows what's on these cylinders. They're blank. NICHOLAS BERGH: No label space to write a nice label. So you get a priceless thing next to something that's just a common cylinder. VANASCO: That's Nick Bergh, the inventor of the endpoint. BERGH: There's a laser in the back of here. And it's looking. . . VANASCO: He flew here from Burbank, Calif. , with his machine and a trunk full of tools. And now he's setting it up. One of the first recordings he's going to try to digitize was found by curator Jessica Wood in 2016. JESSICA WOOD: The music division did not keep very careful acquisitions records back in the 1930s. I just know that the big wooden box that I found, on the inside of the lid, it said, gift of Mary Dana to the New York Public Library in 1935. VANASCO: She's hoping we'll hear a birthday party or something that tells us more about the social history at the time, even someone shouting their name and explaining they're testing the machine, which is a pretty common thing to hear on these recordings - because the important thing about wax cylinders is not just that they played the earliest recordings of commercial music and comedy sketches, it's that for the first time, people were able to record themselves. And many did. Or they were recorded by other people, like ethnographers. Nick Bergh. BERGH: Native American recordings are very rewarding to work on because a lot of times, those communities are relearning their language and such. And there are other stories. And so some of the projects I've work on, they're now cutting those up into words, into phrases to use in the classrooms there on the reservations and such. VANASCO: There are about 2,700 cylinders in the collection of the New York Public Library. Ninety are mysteries. The Endpoint not only produces clearer recordings than earlier machines, but the laser, it can read cylinders that are cracked or broken. Curator Wood takes a box wrapped in brown paper out of a large, red cooler like you'd have at a picnic. WOOD: We usually put it in a cooler because the temperature fluctuation is high enough that it could sort of upset the cylinder. It could cause it to crack. BERGH: Holding - you have to be careful just because of the heat of your hands. You have to kind of, you know, rotate. You don't want to hold it for too long or it could crack just by holding it. VANASCO: It's a light, putty-brown color, which means it's an early recording. Black wax cylinders came later. It's also fairly smooth. Grooves are barely visible. And the cylinder itself is thin. Berg says these are signs that it's a home recording, but also that the levels are very low and may be hard to hear. BERGH: These are all acoustically recorded. So they had to, you know, yell into a horn, essentially. So often, you know, if they're a distance away from the horn, it's a very low recording level. VANASCO: Most of the people doing these recordings were hobbyists who were experimenting. One of the most famous is Lionel Mapleson. He recorded his family. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: (Singing) Good morning, my dear little fool. We come, we come, we come after school. VANASCO: But he was also the librarian for the Metropolitan Opera. And in the early 1900s, he recorded dozens of rehearsals and performances. Listening to his work is the only way you can hear pre-World War I opera singers with a full orchestra. BOB KOSOVSKY: They represent the first extensive recording - live recordings in recorded history. VANASCO: Bob Kosovsky is a librarian in the music and recorded sound division. He says Mapleson was a pioneer. KOSOVSKY: And then he started capturing sounds from the Met stage from various places, first from the prompter's box. And then he went to the fly system. And he got really good results. And he became a kind of fanatic and kept on doing it and doing it. VANASCO: The library knew right away how important these recordings were. Over the years, librarians tried to transfer them to other media several times. They sent them out to the Library of Congress, to Germany. What they got back were sometimes damaged cylinders and recordings that were hard to hear. WOOD: Some of them do sound like brushing your teeth in a rainstorm. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VANASCO: We're not listening to those today. The librarians are taking no chances with the Mapleson cylinders. They don't want to accidentally erase any of the country's cultural history. Instead, we have this mystery cylinder from the family in Maine. It's not in great shape. Bergh cleans it first with an air puffer shaped like a kid's rocket and a brush, but one made of camel hair - a little harsher than the brushes he prefers from a special shop in England. BERGH: They're made from Siberian squirrel (laughter). VANASCO: Bergh fiddles with the machine. The cylinder is turning unevenly. He wraps up small pieces of black paper to use as a shim. BERGH: So if the cylinder is out-of-round, you'll get a wow, that kind of woo-woo, woo-woo sound. VANASCO: Wood is anxious. She says she's been staring at these cylinders. . . WOOD: For, like, seven years, just wondering what's on them. And now to finally see, like. . . VANASCO: The room is silent, waiting. BERGH: OK. VANASCO: Then the recording starts. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"HELLO! MA BABY\")ARTHUR COLLINS: (Singing) Hello, my baby. Hello, my honey. Hello, my ragtime gal. VANASCO: Bergh laughs in surprise. Wood slides to the floor, her head in her hands. Are you so disappointed? WOOD: I thought I was picking something that was unique. And I picked, like, the most everyday thing possible. VANASCO: It's not a birthday party. It's a commercial recording of the song \"Hello! Ma Baby,\" written in 1899 by Joseph E. Howard and Ida Emerson. You've probably heard it before. But there's still hope. The library has a lot of other unidentified cylinders. Wood says she just hopes they're not all \"Hello! Ma Baby. \"I mean, what if they are? What if you have, like, 2,500 \"Hello! My Babies\"? WOOD: Then the - whichever curator acquired that collection is going to be in big trouble. BERGH: (Laughter). VANASCO: Bergh turns back to his work. He needs to calibrate the machine before the librarians can digitize the collection. Once they're done, you'll be able to hear these very earliest of recordings from your own computer - until that technology becomes obsolete, too. Jennifer Vanasco, NPR News, New York.

It has two screens, an intimidating number of buttons and dials, a laser and an arm holding a stylus, like the kind of needle that plays records on a turntable. It's called the Endpoint Cylinder and Dictabelt Machine. And we're going to hear audio that no one else has heard likely since around the turn of the last century. And a lot of times, no one even knows what's on these cylinders. They're blank. NICHOLAS BERGH: No label space to write a nice label. So you get a priceless thing next to something that's just a common cylinder. VANASCO: That's Nick Bergh, the inventor of the endpoint. BERGH: There's a laser in the back of here. And it's looking. . . VANASCO: He flew here from Burbank, Calif. , with his machine and a trunk full of tools. And now he's setting it up. One of the first recordings he's going to try to digitize was found by curator Jessica Wood in 2016. JESSICA WOOD: The music division did not keep very careful acquisitions records back in the 1930s. I just know that the big wooden box that I found, on the inside of the lid, it said, gift of Mary Dana to the New York Public Library in 1935. VANASCO: She's hoping we'll hear a birthday party or something that tells us more about the social history at the time, even someone shouting their name and explaining they're testing the machine, which is a pretty common thing to hear on these recordings - because the important thing about wax cylinders is not just that they played the earliest recordings of commercial music and comedy sketches, it's that for the first time, people were able to record themselves. And many did. Or they were recorded by other people, like ethnographers. Nick Bergh. BERGH: Native American recordings are very rewarding to work on because a lot of times, those communities are relearning their language and such. And there are other stories. And so some of the projects I've work on, they're now cutting those up into words, into phrases to use in the classrooms there on the reservations and such. VANASCO: There are about 2,700 cylinders in the collection of the New York Public Library. Ninety are mysteries. The Endpoint not only produces clearer recordings than earlier machines, but the laser, it can read cylinders that are cracked or broken. Curator Wood takes a box wrapped in brown paper out of a large, red cooler like you'd have at a picnic. WOOD: We usually put it in a cooler because the temperature fluctuation is high enough that it could sort of upset the cylinder. It could cause it to crack. BERGH: Holding - you have to be careful just because of the heat of your hands. You have to kind of, you know, rotate. You don't want to hold it for too long or it could crack just by holding it. VANASCO: It's a light, putty-brown color, which means it's an early recording. Black wax cylinders came later. It's also fairly smooth. Grooves are barely visible. And the cylinder itself is thin. Berg says these are signs that it's a home recording, but also that the levels are very low and may be hard to hear. BERGH: These are all acoustically recorded. So they had to, you know, yell into a horn, essentially. So often, you know, if they're a distance away from the horn, it's a very low recording level. VANASCO: Most of the people doing these recordings were hobbyists who were experimenting. One of the most famous is Lionel Mapleson. He recorded his family. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: (Singing) Good morning, my dear little fool. We come, we come, we come after school. VANASCO: But he was also the librarian for the Metropolitan Opera. And in the early 1900s, he recorded dozens of rehearsals and performances. Listening to his work is the only way you can hear pre-World War I opera singers with a full orchestra. BOB KOSOVSKY: They represent the first extensive recording - live recordings in recorded history. VANASCO: Bob Kosovsky is a librarian in the music and recorded sound division. He says Mapleson was a pioneer. KOSOVSKY: And then he started capturing sounds from the Met stage from various places, first from the prompter's box. And then he went to the fly system. And he got really good results. And he became a kind of fanatic and kept on doing it and doing it. VANASCO: The library knew right away how important these recordings were. Over the years, librarians tried to transfer them to other media several times. They sent them out to the Library of Congress, to Germany. What they got back were sometimes damaged cylinders and recordings that were hard to hear. WOOD: Some of them do sound like brushing your teeth in a rainstorm. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VANASCO: We're not listening to those today. The librarians are taking no chances with the Mapleson cylinders. They don't want to accidentally erase any of the country's cultural history. Instead, we have this mystery cylinder from the family in Maine. It's not in great shape. Bergh cleans it first with an air puffer shaped like a kid's rocket and a brush, but one made of camel hair - a little harsher than the brushes he prefers from a special shop in England. BERGH: They're made from Siberian squirrel (laughter). VANASCO: Bergh fiddles with the machine. The cylinder is turning unevenly. He wraps up small pieces of black paper to use as a shim. BERGH: So if the cylinder is out-of-round, you'll get a wow, that kind of woo-woo, woo-woo sound. VANASCO: Wood is anxious. She says she's been staring at these cylinders. . . WOOD: For, like, seven years, just wondering what's on them. And now to finally see, like. . . VANASCO: The room is silent, waiting. BERGH: OK. VANASCO: Then the recording starts. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"HELLO! MA BABY\") ARTHUR COLLINS: (Singing) Hello, my baby. Hello, my honey. Hello, my ragtime gal. VANASCO: Bergh laughs in surprise. Wood slides to the floor, her head in her hands. Are you so disappointed? WOOD: I thought I was picking something that was unique. And I picked, like, the most everyday thing possible. VANASCO: It's not a birthday party. It's a commercial recording of the song \"Hello! Ma Baby,\" written in 1899 by Joseph E. Howard and Ida Emerson. You've probably heard it before. But there's still hope. The library has a lot of other unidentified cylinders. Wood says she just hopes they're not all \"Hello! Ma Baby. \" I mean, what if they are? What if you have, like, 2,500 \"Hello! My Babies\"? WOOD: Then the - whichever curator acquired that collection is going to be in big trouble. BERGH: (Laughter). VANASCO: Bergh turns back to his work. He needs to calibrate the machine before the librarians can digitize the collection. Once they're done, you'll be able to hear these very earliest of recordings from your own computer - until that technology becomes obsolete, too.

So museums and archives are using new technologies to preserve their testimonies. The hope, as NPR's Neda Ulaby reports, is to help these stories resonate into the future. NEDA ULABY, BYLINE: At the Illinois Holocaust Museum in Skokie, you can slip on a virtual reality headset and enter the world of survivor George Brent as he stepped off a boxcar at Auschwitz. GEORGE BRENT: There was a great deal of shouting. (Non-English language spoken). Leave everything behind. ULABY: As you turn around, on all sides, you see trembling Jewish families, SS officers with guns. There are illustrations, charcoal drawings that then melt like shadows into the actual landscape of Auschwitz today. It was amazing, George Brent said, to see his story unfold via new technology, especially because his memory is beginning to fade. BRENT: That's my problem. When you're 93 years old, you forget certain things. SUSAN ABRAMS: It gives me the chills when I think about it, that this technology became available just in time to capture these stories. ULABY: Susan Abrams runs the Illinois Holocaust Museum, where, for years, survivors would tell their stories to visitors in person. Abrams says the museum spent more than seven figures to recreate George Brent's testimony as a virtual reality experience, complete with location shooting in Poland and Austria. But using new technology to capture survivor's stories is nothing new. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: (Speaking Yiddish). ULABY: In 1946, an American psychology professor named David Boder decided to use then-cutting-edge technology to record testimonies, says Todd Presner. He studies the Holocaust and digital culture. TODD PRESNER: He brought this wire recorder to displaced persons camps throughout Europe, interviewing survivors in multiple languages and really the first one to record their voices. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: (Speaking Polish). ULABY: So powerful, he says, at a time when newsreels were largely silent and images of survivors were seen, not heard. Likewise, he says, the new virtual reality experience with George Brent makes the Holocaust feel immediate, especially if you've never visited a place like Auschwitz. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BRENT: The camp seemed endless everywhere you turned. PRESNER: We realize how large Auschwitz is, or we realize how small a boxcar is. ULABY: After the movie \"Schindler's List\" came out in 1993, gathering testimonies gained new momentum. Director Steven Spielberg decided to create one of the largest digital collections of survivor testimonies in the world. The USC Shoah Foundation is run right now by Kori Street, who's now standing in its quiet lobby, facing a life-size screen of an elderly man in a pink, upholstered chair. KORI STREET: Pinchas, can you tell us your story? ULABY: The man, who looks a little like the actor Anthony Hopkins, appears to compose himself. He blinks and begins. PINCHAS GUTTER: My name is Pinchas Gutter. I was born in 1932 in Lodz. ULABY: This video of Pinchas Gutter is enabled by artificial intelligence to answer questions. For example, Pinchas, what was life like in the Warsaw Ghetto? GUTTER: An apocalyptic inferno is not even words that you can describe what went on in the ghetto. ULABY: Interactive experiences like this one are more compelling to many visitors, says Kori Street, than just passively watching archival footage of survivor testimonies, which can now be repurposed with new technology. STREET: There's no reason we can't take these 2D testimonies, of which we have 55,000, and retrofit them to work with AI. ULABY: When you think right now about interactive museum experiences, the ones getting the most attention feature the work of famous artists. STREET: There's a lot of debate about some of these immersive experiences - the Van Gogh most recently, the Frida Kahlo one. People either love it, or they don't. But museums, to get people in, they need to keep on this. ULABY: So will the Holocaust, the immersive experience, be coming to a museum near you? Sarah Lumbard, who works at the U. S. Holocaust Museum in Washington, D. C. , says it's not entirely out of the question. SARAH LUMBARD: In VR, we've looked at how do you explain the experience of the Warsaw ghetto? How might we explain that, really transporting you to the ghetto? ULABY: With a specific story, she says, about the Jewish resistance groups preserving evidence of what happened there. So the idea, says Shoah Foundation director Kori Street, is not like \"Westworld. \"STREET: There are really excellent applications of game theory to learning about Holocaust and genocide without it devolving into something that is dangerous, that is dark tourism. ULABY: At a time of rising bigotry of all sorts and when anti-vaxxers trivialize survivors' experiences, Holocaust museum directors say their stories are more important than ever.

He's offering $43 billion to buy Twitter - the entire company. NPR tech correspondent Shannon Bond is here to tell us more. Hey, Shannon. SHANNON BOND, BYLINE: Hey, Daniel. ESTRIN: OK. We know Elon Musk loves to tweet. Why does he want to buy the entire company? BOND: Yeah. I mean, he's really a prolific tweeter, as you said. He has 81 million followers. He loves to use this platform to provoke and share memes, to hype up his companies, Tesla and SpaceX. He's also a really vocal critic of Twitter. So in his letter to Twitter's chairman making this offer, Musk says he believes Twitter has great potential to be the platform for free speech but that it's not living up to that potential. He says he doesn't have confidence in management. And Musk believes he can be the one who changes Twitter. He says he wants to take it private to do so. ESTRIN: Is Twitter considering the offer? BOND: Yes. Twitter's board is reviewing this offer. And I spoke with Scott Kessler. He's an analyst at research firm Third Bridge. He says this could actually open the door to other interested buyers who might have their own designs on Twitter. SCOTT KESSLER: This is really perhaps the beginning of a process, and it's not necessarily going to start and end with Elon Musk. BOND: And look, Daniel - this has been a wild ride for Twitter. It was only last Monday that Musk disclosed he'd bought enough stock to become the company's biggest individual shareholder, immediately sparking questions over his intentions. Twitter offered him a board seat. He agreed to take it. But then over the weekend, he changed his mind. And Musk knows the board has to take his bid seriously. He says it's his best and final offer, and if the board rejects it, he might sell his Twitter shares. That could spark a big drop in the stock price. And Twitter shares have bounced around today. They closed well below Musk's offer price, suggesting that investors aren't so sure what to make of this because, of course, this is Elon Musk. You never know. ESTRIN: Yeah. Now, here's another question. Musk says he wants to buy Twitter so that he can allow users to exercise free speech more freely. What is that about? BOND: Well, he describes himself as a free-speech absolutist. He's been critical of rules about what people are allowed to say on Twitter. But, of course, Twitter is a lot smaller than other popular social networks like Facebook or TikTok. It's under pressure to add users, grow its business and advertising. And getting rid of rules against things like hate speech, false claims about COVID - that could be a big turnoff for advertisers and users. Here's Karen Kornbluh with the German Marshall Fund. She studies online disinformation. KAREN KORNBLUH: When you poll people, people say they want moderation, that they don't want conspiracy theories floating freely on their platforms. They don't want harassment. So I think it's a misunderstanding of what people want. BOND: But, you know, at a conference today, Musk said this is not about making money or about the economics of Twitter. It's about free speech. And he said if Twitter rejects his bid, it's not over. He has a plan B, but he has not shared details of what that is. ESTRIN: All right. Well, stay tuned. NPR's Shannon Bond, thanks. BOND: Thanks, Daniel. DANIEL ESTRIN, HOST:   The world's richest person also happens to be a prolific Twitter user, and now Elon Musk believes he can unlock the social network's potential. He's offering $43 billion to buy Twitter - the entire company. NPR tech correspondent Shannon Bond is here to tell us more. Hey, Shannon. SHANNON BOND, BYLINE: Hey, Daniel. ESTRIN: OK. We know Elon Musk loves to tweet. Why does he want to buy the entire company? BOND: Yeah. I mean, he's really a prolific tweeter, as you said. He has 81 million followers. He loves to use this platform to provoke and share memes, to hype up his companies, Tesla and SpaceX. He's also a really vocal critic of Twitter. So in his letter to Twitter's chairman making this offer, Musk says he believes Twitter has great potential to be the platform for free speech but that it's not living up to that potential. He says he doesn't have confidence in management. And Musk believes he can be the one who changes Twitter. He says he wants to take it private to do so. ESTRIN: Is Twitter considering the offer? BOND: Yes. Twitter's board is reviewing this offer. And I spoke with Scott Kessler. He's an analyst at research firm Third Bridge. He says this could actually open the door to other interested buyers who might have their own designs on Twitter. SCOTT KESSLER: This is really perhaps the beginning of a process, and it's not necessarily going to start and end with Elon Musk. BOND: And look, Daniel - this has been a wild ride for Twitter. It was only last Monday that Musk disclosed he'd bought enough stock to become the company's biggest individual shareholder, immediately sparking questions over his intentions. Twitter offered him a board seat. He agreed to take it. But then over the weekend, he changed his mind. And Musk knows the board has to take his bid seriously. He says it's his best and final offer, and if the board rejects it, he might sell his Twitter shares. That could spark a big drop in the stock price. And Twitter shares have bounced around today. They closed well below Musk's offer price, suggesting that investors aren't so sure what to make of this because, of course, this is Elon Musk. You never know. ESTRIN: Yeah. Now, here's another question. Musk says he wants to buy Twitter so that he can allow users to exercise free speech more freely. What is that about? BOND: Well, he describes himself as a free-speech absolutist. He's been critical of rules about what people are allowed to say on Twitter. But, of course, Twitter is a lot smaller than other popular social networks like Facebook or TikTok. It's under pressure to add users, grow its business and advertising. And getting rid of rules against things like hate speech, false claims about COVID - that could be a big turnoff for advertisers and users. Here's Karen Kornbluh with the German Marshall Fund. She studies online disinformation. KAREN KORNBLUH: When you poll people, people say they want moderation, that they don't want conspiracy theories floating freely on their platforms. They don't want harassment. So I think it's a misunderstanding of what people want. BOND: But, you know, at a conference today, Musk said this is not about making money or about the economics of Twitter. It's about free speech. And he said if Twitter rejects his bid, it's not over. He has a plan B, but he has not shared details of what that is. ESTRIN: All right. Well, stay tuned. NPR's Shannon Bond, thanks.

So Twitter's board of directors today introduced something known as a poison pill plan. Right now, Elon Musk owns, like, 9% of the company. But under this plan, if he or, you know, really anyone else tries to buy 15% or more of Twitter, this pill kicks in. And what happens then is, you know, Twitter's stock would become available at a discount, basically flooding the market with really cheap Twitter stock. And, you know, for Elon Musk, that could mean the shares of Twitter that he now owns could be cut in half. And that, you know, would be a loss in the billions of dollars. I talked to corporate governance expert Edward Rock about this. He's with NYU's Law School. EDWARD ROCK: The poison pill puts a temporary roadblock in front of Musk going forward, which gives the board a chance to evaluate the bid, whether it makes sense to sell the company and, if they are going to sell the company, whether it makes sense to sell the company to him. ALLYN: Yeah. In essence, it's a delaying tactic. It gives, you know, Twitter up to a year to figure out what to do. CHANG: OK, but is this poison pill strategy going to be enough to actually end this bid from Musk, you think? ALLYN: Yeah, we don't know just yet. But, you know, Ailsa, the larger question that we hear in Silicon Valley is, you know, just how serious is Musk when he says he wants to buy Twitter? I mean, one really notable absence in the SEC paperwork that he submitted to try to acquire Twitter was how he plans to pay for it. The paperwork, you know, said that his bid hinges on the, quote, \"completion of anticipated financing,\" right? CHANG: OK. ALLYN: A wee bit vague. CHANG: Yeah (laughter). ALLYN: So I mean, as, you know, obviously the richest person in the world, he can probably figure out some way to buy Twitter for the $43 billion he says it's worth. But, you know, without any specifics, some people are like, is he making a legitimate investment decision, or is he trolling us? Is this some elaborate. . . CHANG: Yeah. ALLYN: . . . Elon Musk joke? CHANG: That's what I want to talk about. Like, can we just step back for a second to talk about why in the world Elon Musk would even want to own Twitter? Like, what do you think his ultimate motivation is here? ALLYN: Yeah. That's a good question. And the problem is he's kind of all over the place with exactly what his motivations are here. So we all know Musk is a very erratic person, and he's living up to that reputation here with this Twitter drama. He, you know, says he wants Twitter to be more of a free-speech platform, not subject to what he calls censorship. He also says he wants more transparency around how Twitter's algorithm works - you know, why are some tweets demoted, some tweets promoted? - sort of a glimpse into that process. But look - Musk just courts controversy and attention everywhere he goes. This is a very influential piece of internet real estate.

TERRENCE FLOYD: It's changing. It's not changing at a rapid pace, but it's changing, you know? But one thing I say about change - nothing in the physical form will change until you change your mindset.

Elon Musk loves to tweet, and he says he has a lot of ideas that might unlock the platform's potential. But the changes he's calling for at Twitter might not be popular with some users and advertisers. NPR's tech correspondent Shannon Bond joins us. Shannon, thanks so much for being with us. SHANNON BOND, BYLINE: Thanks for having me, Scott. SIMON: So how is Twitter trying to prevent the richest man in the world from buying what is, after all, a public company? BOND: Well, the company is preparing to fight back. On Friday, the day after Musk announced this $43 billion takeover offer, Twitter's board introduced what's known as a poison pill to fend off Musk. Basically, this would let current investors buy more shares at a discount if Musk or anyone else tries to increase their stake in Twitter to 15% or more. And so that would make it more expensive for Musk to buy the company. So, you know, the board is not rolling over here. This sets up a real fight over the future of the company. Now, Musk already owns 9% of Twitter, but he says he wants to buy the rest and take it private to, as he puts it, unlock its potential. SIMON: Do we know what he'd like to do with it? BOND: Well, you know, Twitter, of course, has its problems, right? It's lost money in the last few years. It's not growing as quickly as investors would like. But unlike your typical corporate raider, Musk has been very upfront that this is not about making money. At a conference on Thursday, he said what he cares about is free speech. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)ELON MUSK: Twitter has become kind of the de facto town square, so it's just really important that people have the - both the reality and the perception that they are able to speak freely within the bounds of the law. BOND: And so that's what Musk means when he talks about potential. He thinks Twitter is overly restrictive about what people are allowed to say, and he wants to change that. SIMON: And how would you change it if he succeeds in a takeover? BOND: Well, Musk says he thinks Twitter should basically allow all legal speech. And, you know, in the U. S. , that's just about anything. So, you know, if Twitter were to do this, it would mean allowing disinformation, hate speech, harassment, spam. These are all things that Twitter and other internet platforms have been cracking down on. And, you know, we know these platforms already have a lot of problems with toxic content, anyway. Karen Kornbluh studies online disinformation at the German Marshall Fund, and she says there's a reason major platforms have these rules, especially Twitter, given who uses it most. KAREN KORNBLUH: Their asset is all the journalists and opinion-makers who come there. If they kill that asset by making it completely inhospitable and a cesspool, I think they're going to go in the wrong direction. BOND: And, of course, Scott, you know, Twitter makes its money from ads. And advertisers also don't want to be around this kind of content. SIMON: What other ideas does Elon Musk have for Twitter? BOND: Well, you know, he knows the platform really well, right? He loves to tweet. He really gets how Twitter works. And so he's talked about banning bot accounts that tweet automatically, right? These have caused lots of headaches for Twitter over the years. Russian trolls use them to spread disinformation. There are also networks of bots that constantly tweet about cryptocurrency to try to hype up prices. Musk also says he wants to make Twitter's algorithm public so users could better understand why they're being shown particular tweets. That's something, actually, former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey has also advocated for. And maybe the most popular idea Musk has endorsed is giving people the ability to edit their tweets after they're posted. Now, that might not seem like a big deal, but it's something a lot of Twitter users have wanted for years.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Elon, welcome. CHANG: What's the big deal? (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)ELON MUSK: Well, I think it's very important for there to be an inclusive arena for free speech where all - so, yeah. CHANG: Elon Musk appeared at last week's TED Conference in Vancouver, where he was asked why he put a $43 billion offer on the table for Twitter. Musk said he wanted Twitter's code to be public. Also, he says he thinks Twitter has too many rules when it comes to what you get to say on the platform. The company has policies against certain forms of hate speech and disinformation, and Musk thinks that users should be able to, quote, \"speak freely within the bounds of the law. \"(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MUSK: Twitter has become kind of the de facto town square. So. . . CHANG: The thing is, it's not a town square where most people are. According to Pew Research, fewer than 30% of adults in the U. S. say they even use Twitter. And about that free speech argument. . . KATE KLONICK: To allow all legal speech, you would have to allow all spam to stay up on the platform. You would have to allow all pornography to stay up on the platform, all forms of hate speech. It could make the platform functionally unusable. CHANG: Kate Klonick with St. John's University in New York focuses on private governance of online speech, and Klonick told NPR that Musk's offer to buy Twitter underscores how, when it comes to speech on the internet today, money is power. KLONICK: What this moment is really showing us for a lot of people is that these private platforms are really susceptible to the power of capitalism. The fault lines that we expect to exist are being exposed. CHANG: CONSIDER THIS - Elon Musk says his bid to own and change Twitter is about promoting democracy, not about making money. But his offer to buy the platform arguably represents a particular style of capitalism, a style of capitalism that one historian calls extreme. JILL LEPORE: I think it's a kind of unchecked capitalism that insists that the government really has no role in the regulation of economic activity. CHANG: That's coming up. From NPR, I'm Ailsa Chang. It's Monday, April 18. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)CHANG: It's CONSIDER THIS FROM NPR. So before he made an offer to buy Twitter entirely, Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla, SpaceX and other companies, had already bought a small part of Twitter in the form of stock. That purchase came earlier this month. But last week, Twitter came up with a plan to prevent Musk's share from getting much bigger. I spoke to NPR tech reporter Bobby Allyn about what is going on here. BOBBY ALLYN, BYLINE: Hey, Ailsa. CHANG: OK, so how is Twitter trying to stop Musk? ALLYN: Yeah. So Twitter's board of directors introduced something known as a poison pill plan. Right now, Elon Musk owns, like, 9% of the company. But under this plan, if he or, you know, really anyone else tries to buy 15% or more of Twitter, this pill kicks in. And what happens then is, you know, Twitter stock would become available at a discount, basically flooding the market with really cheap Twitter stock. And, you know, for Elon Musk, that could mean the shares of Twitter that he now owns could be cut in half. And that, you know, would be a loss in the billions of dollars. I talked to corporate governance expert Edward Rock about this. He's with NYU Law School. EDWARD ROCK: The poison pill puts a temporary roadblock in front of Musk going forward, which gives the board a chance to evaluate the bid, whether it makes sense to sell the company, and if they are going to sell the company, whether it makes sense to sell the company to him. ALLYN: Yeah. In essence, it's a delaying tactic. It gives, you know, Twitter up to a year to figure out what to do. CHANG: OK. But is this poison pill strategy going to be enough to actually end this bid from Musk, you think? ALLYN: Yeah, we don't know just yet. But, you know, Ailsa, the larger question that we hear in Silicon Valley is, you know, just how serious is Musk when he says he wants to buy Twitter? I mean, one really notable absence in the SEC paperwork that he submitted to try to acquire Twitter was how he plans to pay for it. The paperwork, you know, said that his bid hinges on the, quote, \"completion of anticipated financing,\" right? - a wee bit vague. CHANG: (Laughter) Yeah. ALLYN: So, I mean, as, you know, obviously the richest person in the world, he can probably figure out some way to buy Twitter for the $43 billion he says it's worth. But, you know, without any specifics, some people are like, is he making a legitimate investment decision, or is he trolling us? Is this some elaborate Elon Musk joke? CHANG: Yeah. That's what I want to talk about. Like, can we just step back for a second to talk about why in the world Elon Musk would even want to own Twitter? Like, what do you think his ultimate motivation is here? ALLYN: Yeah. That's a good question. And the problem is he's kind of all over the place with exactly what his motivations are here. So we all know Musk is a very erratic person, and he's living up to that reputation here with this Twitter drama. He, you know, says he wants Twitter to be more of a free speech platform, not subject to what he calls censorship. He also says he wants more transparency around how Twitter's algorithm works. You know, why are some tweets demoted, some tweets promoted? - sort of a glimpse into that process. But look; Musk just courts controversy and tension everywhere he goes. This is a very influential piece of internet real estate, so I think he sees this as a chance to get bragging rights, a chance to stay in the headlines and maybe a chance to troll all of us. Who knows? CHANG: (Laughter) That is NPR's Bobby Allyn. Thank you, Bobby. ALLYN: Thanks, Ailsa. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)CHANG: So yeah, we don't know yet if the vision Elon Musk has for the future of Twitter will ever become a reality. Musk, of course, has a vision for the future of lots of other things too, like spaceflight and driverless cars. And that vision, according to historian Jill Lepore, stems from the science fiction that Elon Musk grew up on, science fiction that was full of stories about conquering space and saving humanity. But Lepore argues in her podcast, \"The Evening Rocket,\" that Elon Musk missed something about those stories and what they were trying to say about capitalism. Jill Lepore spoke to NPR's Daniel Estrin about what she's coined Muskism (ph). DANIEL ESTRIN, BYLINE: So what is Muskism? LEPORE: (Laughter) I think of it as sort of an extreme, extravagant form of capitalism, really extraterrestrial capitalism. X is Musk's favorite letter of the alphabet, as it is of many science fiction fans. So X capitalism seems somehow also to fit. ESTRIN: How do you define extreme capitalism? LEPORE: I think it's a kind of unchecked capitalism that insists that the government really has no role in the regulation of economic activity at the practical level. I think at the cultural level, it really is engaged with selling the public on the idea of futurism as a way to impose economic conditions that come from the very deep past. I think of Muskism and its vision for, you know, colonizing Mars as dating from the age of imperialism, when British imperialists who are colonizing countries around the world and science fiction writers like H. G. Wells were indicting British imperialism by telling stories about space colonies and how wrong that would be to take other people's land and enslave the people there. And for Musk, somehow you can resurrect those stories in order to justify colonization. So Muskism always has within it - this extreme capitalism always has within it - almost a kind of ironic twist. ESTRIN: Well, he is a big science fiction fan. You talk about that on your podcast - an early fascination with sci-fi, like \"The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy. \" So how does his love of sci-fi translate into his vision of the future of technology? LEPORE: As a historian, one of the things I find so fascinating about Musk and Muskism is how much of the sort of fantasy of invention, especially disruptive innovation - remember that buzzword from the '90s - boasts itself as part of a culture of futurism. But so much of what the culture of Silicon Valley produces has its origins in science fiction, as I think a lot of those people would themselves recognize. But what they wouldn't see is that the origins in science fiction - there's actually origins in dystopian science fiction. So what a lot of people like Musk and others celebrate as their great futurism is, for one thing, really as tremendously important origins in the past. And for another, what they celebrate as often utopian is - has origins in dystopianism. ESTRIN: I mean, he's even been called the real-life Tony Stark, you know, from the Marvel Universe. I mean, does he see himself that way as a kind of almost, like, a real-life science fiction character? Does that impact the way he interacts with public life? LEPORE: I think there was a period in his life when he was really into being Iron Man and being Tony Stark, and the press loved that. And he was on the cover of every magazine, as, you know, he appeared in one of the \"Iron Man\" movies with Robert Downey Jr. So he has a kind of celebrity iconic status. I mean, he's the guy who was on SNL, right? And it's part of the boyishness that Musketeers really love about him, right? It's - he can be very funny. He can be very witty online. He's an extremely smart guy. And there's a playfulness around that. One of the things that's distinctive about Musk, in the sense that he's the best at this, is depicting your product as saving humanity. This also became a thing in Musk's really early years. So even the Twitter bid, in Musk's language, is somehow about saving civilization. ESTRIN: Well, let's get to the Twitter bid in a second, but I just want to speak seriously for a second because he has this large group of passionate fans - the Musketeers, as you call them. I mean, in my own family, just this weekend, a relative of mine - we were speaking about models of leadership and what leaders we admire, and my cousin mentioned Elon Musk. And, you know, I have another cousin in Ukraine who, out of the blue, said to me, I thank Elon Musk for helping provide Starlink, you know, internet access in Ukraine during the war. So what is it about him that you think fascinates people so much and makes them buy into that vision of almost saving humanity? LEPORE: Well, I think Musk presents himself as a messiah. I think that Musk especially appeals, at least in my universe of talking to people, to people who are really kind of geeking out in engineering as someone who is daring and courageous, maybe a little reckless. I mean, I think since Trump's removal from Twitter, Musk, who had been on Twitter for a long time with large numbers of followers, kind of really became that kind of love-hate Twitter account. ESTRIN: So let's talk about Elon Musk on Twitter and wanting to own Twitter. He wants Twitter to be more like a public town square. He often tweets about his political views, but it's very hard to pinpoint where exactly he is politically. He's called COVID-19 lockdowns fascist, but he has also resigned from former President Trump's business councils after the Trump administration pulled out of the Paris climate accord. So what do you think - based on what you've learned about him, what do you think he'd want to do with Twitter if he bought it? LEPORE: So I think Musk's politics are elusive for a reason, and I think the best way to discover them is to look at what he says about science fiction. Musk grew up in South Africa under apartheid and left to avoid serving in the military that enforced that regime. He left when he was 17. But his favorite book as a child was Douglas Adams' \"Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy,\" which he cites almost as a kind of guide for living - his kind of Bible. But \"The Hitchhiker's Guide,\" which was a radio play put out by BBC Radio 4, is actually an indictment of luxury capitalism. I mean, Douglas Adams had on his typewriter a sticker that said end apartheid. Like, he wrote \"Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy\" in order to indict systems of vast income inequality where whole groups of people had no political authority whatsoever. So I think, you know, to try to deduce what Musk is looking for in attempting to buy Twitter, you'd be well-advised to look for evidence of other public-spirited activity. I mean, he has objectively - you know, I guess what he would say and has said - he needs to take over Twitter in order to save civilization. But where is the evidence that Musk has ever really been interested in democratic discourse? He routinely trolls people online. He's had an often-adversarial relationship to the free press. He doesn't think that someone as wealthy as he is should have to pay taxes, as you say, during the pandemic. You know, he tweeted free America now. He described the lockdown and various shutdowns as fascist. There's just really not a whole lot of evidence that his big priority is healthy democratic society. So I think you could probably set aside the sort of wrapping on that package and ask yourself, what is it that he really wants, aside from more attention, from Twitter? CHANG: That was historian Jill Lepore. There's a link to her podcast, \"The Evening Rocket,\" in our episode notes. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)CHANG: It's CONSIDER THIS FROM NPR. I'm Ailsa Chang. AILSA CHANG, HOST:   OK, so a billionaire wants to buy a company. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Elon, welcome. CHANG: What's the big deal? (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ELON MUSK: Well, I think it's very important for there to be an inclusive arena for free speech where all - so, yeah. CHANG: Elon Musk appeared at last week's TED Conference in Vancouver, where he was asked why he put a $43 billion offer on the table for Twitter. Musk said he wanted Twitter's code to be public. Also, he says he thinks Twitter has too many rules when it comes to what you get to say on the platform. The company has policies against certain forms of hate speech and disinformation, and Musk thinks that users should be able to, quote, \"speak freely within the bounds of the law. \" (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MUSK: Twitter has become kind of the de facto town square. So. . . CHANG: The thing is, it's not a town square where most people are. According to Pew Research, fewer than 30% of adults in the U. S. say they even use Twitter. And about that free speech argument. . . KATE KLONICK: To allow all legal speech, you would have to allow all spam to stay up on the platform. You would have to allow all pornography to stay up on the platform, all forms of hate speech. It could make the platform functionally unusable. CHANG: Kate Klonick with St. John's University in New York focuses on private governance of online speech, and Klonick told NPR that Musk's offer to buy Twitter underscores how, when it comes to speech on the internet today, money is power. KLONICK: What this moment is really showing us for a lot of people is that these private platforms are really susceptible to the power of capitalism. The fault lines that we expect to exist are being exposed. CHANG: CONSIDER THIS - Elon Musk says his bid to own and change Twitter is about promoting democracy, not about making money. But his offer to buy the platform arguably represents a particular style of capitalism, a style of capitalism that one historian calls extreme. JILL LEPORE: I think it's a kind of unchecked capitalism that insists that the government really has no role in the regulation of economic activity. CHANG: That's coming up. From NPR, I'm Ailsa Chang. It's Monday, April 18. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) CHANG: It's CONSIDER THIS FROM NPR. So before he made an offer to buy Twitter entirely, Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla, SpaceX and other companies, had already bought a small part of Twitter in the form of stock. That purchase came earlier this month. But last week, Twitter came up with a plan to prevent Musk's share from getting much bigger. I spoke to NPR tech reporter Bobby Allyn about what is going on here. BOBBY ALLYN, BYLINE: Hey, Ailsa. CHANG: OK, so how is Twitter trying to stop Musk? ALLYN: Yeah. So Twitter's board of directors introduced something known as a poison pill plan. Right now, Elon Musk owns, like, 9% of the company. But under this plan, if he or, you know, really anyone else tries to buy 15% or more of Twitter, this pill kicks in. And what happens then is, you know, Twitter stock would become available at a discount, basically flooding the market with really cheap Twitter stock. And, you know, for Elon Musk, that could mean the shares of Twitter that he now owns could be cut in half. And that, you know, would be a loss in the billions of dollars. I talked to corporate governance expert Edward Rock about this. He's with NYU Law School. EDWARD ROCK: The poison pill puts a temporary roadblock in front of Musk going forward, which gives the board a chance to evaluate the bid, whether it makes sense to sell the company, and if they are going to sell the company, whether it makes sense to sell the company to him. ALLYN: Yeah. In essence, it's a delaying tactic. It gives, you know, Twitter up to a year to figure out what to do. CHANG: OK.

ALLYN: So, I mean, as, you know, obviously the richest person in the world, he can probably figure out some way to buy Twitter for the $43 billion he says it's worth.

Now it's even worse with the rise of fake fact-checkers. You've probably seen real fact-check articles online, news organizations debunking rumors and fake news circulating on social media. Several channels on the messaging app Telegram look like independent fact-checkers, but if you look closer, you see they're actually pro-Russian propaganda outlets spreading fake news about the invasion. Kevin Nguyen has written about the latest front in the information war for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, and he joins me now. Welcome. KEVIN NGUYEN: Hi, Daniel. ESTRIN: Can you briefly walk us through this? When someone opens up their Telegram app, what are they seeing? NGUYEN: So Telegram is a encrypted messaging app. If you are using it to follow the invasion of Ukraine and you're following these kind of fake fact-checking outlets, you would never know that they're actually - they don't specifically tell them - tell you that they're Russian-aligned. But if you were to go into them, what you're going to find is exclusively anti-Ukrainian, what appears, or what it positions itself, as sophisticated forensic analysis of events, of specific videos and of specific events within the Ukrainian invasion. ESTRIN: So give us a specific example of one of the fake fact-checking channels that you've been looking at. NGUYEN: One example I looked at was the attack of the TV tower in Kyiv, which is the Ukrainian capital. Look how strange these bodies are positioned. Look how close the morgue is to this TV tower. Isn't that suspicious? And here's a picture of Google Maps showing you that it's quite close to each other. ESTRIN: So the claim was that Ukrainians allegedly had brought bodies in from the morgue to stage that there were deaths in that attack? NGUYEN: Yes, it's just unilaterally false information. ESTRIN: So these fake fact-check channels we're seeing primarily on Telegram. NGUYEN: Yes, yeah. ESTRIN: Well, how much traction do these fake fact-check channels get? NGUYEN: It's difficult to say. Telegram's a bit harder to read than, say, Twitter in terms of its reach or its impressions. The issue with Telegram is not just that you're going to this group and that's all you're seeing. It's that Russian officials - other accounts are taking these exact claims and running it as well. ESTRIN: Well, Kevin, what is the goal? I mean, are they trying to convince Russians with these fake posts or are they trying to dupe, you know, people around the world? NGUYEN: This is a tactic that's kind of emerged. I mean, we've seen fake fact-checkers before, fake media outlets before, but it's - in terms of how it's getting other outlets to report on it as well, Russian state media has been very effective over the past couple of years of actually getting a lot of other people to run their lines of rhetoric. A really good example of this is Russia has very specific language about how it frames this invasion of Ukraine. They call it a Ukrainian Special Operation. And you see that parroted by Chinese state media. So just a few hours ago, the People's Daily in China is very specifically calling it a Ukrainian Special Operation. ESTRIN: And. . . NGUYEN: So and that's kind of new. And this - the Telegram and the fake fact-checking through this is just a bit of an extension of that. ESTRIN: Well, the end result is if you flood the zone with a lot of fake news, you create doubt. And then people think twice about sympathizing with Ukraine. NGUYEN: Yeah. When you - when doubt flourishes, you become reluctant to even sympathize. ESTRIN: So before I let you go, what advice do you have for average news consumers? Not only do they have to check their sources when - before they share something on social media, but when they see a fact-check, are they supposed to be verifying the verifiers now? NGUYEN: What should be happening is that there are people who have proven - have a proven track record of doing it really, really well and doing it in this service of truth. And if you are looking specifically for fact-checks, check the ones that you know have a proven track record. It's interesting because me saying the next line plays into it, but sometimes you don't want to disbelieve it on the first go and you need to take that extra step. But if you're going to take that extra step, take it with someone that you trust. ESTRIN: Kevin Nguyen is a reporter and producer for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.

We're not talking about Ukraine here but Estonia. The war is in cyberspace, part of a NATO-led annual drill. And this year, the stakes couldn't be higher. NPR cybersecurity correspondent Jenna McLaughlin sends us this report from the Estonian capital. JENNA MCLAUGHLIN, BYLINE: Berylia and Crimsonia are at war. The two islands disagree on politics, on who controls neighboring islands and their resources. One lashes out at the other in cyberspace. MEJ YAKER: And as you can see on a screen there, about 20% of firewalls, for example, have been attacked out of a two-day campaign. MCLAUGHLIN: Mej Yaker (ph) is the leader of the red team, Crimsonia, the bad guys in a cyber exercise held every year called Locked Shields. Normally, he's the head of a private cybersecurity company. Today, he's the adversary. A screen outside their war room shows the attacks they're launching. Right now, it's mostly attacks on energy companies and on the website of the Berylia institute of virology. And the red team is just getting started. YAKER: We always play the, like in boxing, left and right hand. So we have a lot of very visible attacks. Usually, these are website defacements, and which are more of an annoyance, like drawing attention away to do the more prepositioning for the later attacks that the blue team most likely is not noticing yet. MCLAUGHLIN: Everyone will notice when the attacks are really successful. For one thing, the giant screen imitating the power grid will turn red. Worst case, there's a box full of firecrackers for special effects. KERRY COONGER: And yes, when it explode, it means that the system's down, basically. MCLAUGHLIN: That's exercise director Kerry Coonger (ph). COONGER: If the blue teams defend it, then it won't blow. MCLAUGHLIN: The two imaginary island nations don't exist, of course. But Estonia has been running cyber drills since 2008, the year after Russia basically knocked the country offline in one of the first overt ideological cyberattacks on a nation. COONGER: We look at how modern conflict is being conducted, and we bring it into our exercise environment. MCLAUGHLIN: The mastermind of the exercise, Adrian Venables, says he has been working on the plot of this week's cyberwar for the last year, well before Russia invaded Ukraine. ADRIAN VENABLES: I monitor global information warfare scenarios and real-world events, and then we incorporate them into our exercises. So they are absolutely real and are all inspired by what we see in today's world. MCLAUGHLIN: That includes hackers targeting brand-new technology, like 5G and a communication system for international banking, plus, says Venables, a big emphasis on the power of social media. VENABLES: As the exercise has developed, we've introduced much more social media in use, So we have Twitter emulators and we've introduced for the first time this year a TikTok-type emulator of short videos. MCLAUGHLIN: Simulated TikTok and Twitter - or Birdle (ph) in this fictional country - might sound funny, but the tone of these games is notably serious. The real-life war in Ukraine is on everyone's minds. KALLE LAANET: Of course, it's more serious. And if I'm looking at the faces behind the computers, they are serious, motivated and trying to do his best. MCLAUGHLIN: That's Estonian Defense Minister Kalle Laanet. He stopped by the exercise wearing a blue flower pin on his lapel in honor of veterans month, a symbol of spring renewal. He noted the war in Ukraine is a stark reminder that Russia, just over the border, could attack any of the countries participating in the exercise at any time, something Estonia knows firsthand and is dead set on stopping.

Right now, when you post a message on the site, it stays there, unchanged, even after you notice the typo or someone calls out your faulty logic. You can delete the post but never change it. Now the service is considering an update, and this matters to you, whether you use Twitter or not. Most people do not use Twitter, yet it has a huge effect on the public debate. Celebrities and politicians use it to drop little press releases. Journalists put their reporting on there and also make news stories out of Twitter conversation. So how does public discourse change if you can change it? We called an expert on typos and messages you wish you could take back. Michael Leggett spent about 13 years as a design lead and manager at Google and Facebook. MICHAEL LEGGETT: My passion for this is borne out of my inattention to typos. I'm somewhat of a phonetic speller. I almost actually didn't get married due to poor spelling. INSKEEP: What? LEGGETT: Well, my wife - early on in our relationship, she said that she was so concerned with my misspelling on instant messenger that she wasn't sure about continuing to date me. INSKEEP: (Laughter). LEGGETT: And luckily, spellcheck was added to the product I was using at the time for instant messaging, and my spelling started getting better. And she's like, oh, maybe it's not that bad. INSKEEP: It saved you. It saved you. LEGGETT: It saved me. It did. INSKEEP: Did you misspell, like, her name or her mom's name or. . . LEGGETT: No, not her - no, I didn't misspell her name. I just misspelled - I'd misspell common words. So. . . INSKEEP: (Laughter). Needless to say, Michael Leggett favors a Twitter edit button. The question is how to do it. Tweets right now get shared, responded to and embedded in news stories. LEGGETT: So there are new abuse factors with editing, in that if I tweet something and then you've retweeted or a hundred people retweeted or a website, like NPR, you know, embeds it in an article, there are valid issues that are not obvious how to fix around, what do you do with those edits? Do you honor the intention of fixing the edits, or do you honor the intention of the original retweeter or publisher in trying to publish what the original thought was? INSKEEP: Can you tell a layman a little bit about how that would work? Like, the tweet that's embedded in a news story. . . LEGGETT: Yeah. INSKEEP: . . . That the original user edited two hours later - what happens to that news story? LEGGETT: Absolutely. So I think that there's at least two things to consider. So one is when you edit a tweet, I think it's really important that the original tweet is - it's not replaced, right? So there are what's often called in programming - is versioning. So as I've edited a tweet - let's say I edit it five times. All five of those versions are maintained somewhere. And ideally, you can still, you know, get to them. But the thing that really cracked this open for me in thinking that it's very possible to fix is thinking about track changes and any kind of word-processing application. INSKEEP: Oh, sure. LEGGETT: So, you know, Microsoft Word or Google Docs - you can see the edits, right? The design is all built around making it very visible - what has changed, what was removed, what was added, et cetera. So I think that design pattern - which is one that's very mature, one that people are very used to - could easily be applied here where an edit's been made and you actually see the edit - you see the words that were crossed out, you see the words that were added or changed. INSKEEP: I'm realizing that for public figures, the kind of people whose tweets become news stories, this could create an entirely new genre of news story where the reporting is they first said this and then they changed it to Option B and then they changed it a third time, and watch how their thinking evolved. LEGGETT: Sure. Yeah, I think - well, and, in fact, like, that's already commonplace. What's unfortunate is it's just not applied to the original tweet. What you'll have happen is a public figure - you know, a politician will tweet something and, you know, a lot of people will lambast it, saying that's just false, right? That's fake news. And it spreads like wildflower - wildfire. See? Wildflower. There's a mistake right there. INSKEEP: Use the edit button and clean that up. LEGGETT: Use the edit button (laughter). It'll spread. And then eventually, the person will come back and issue a retraction as a reply to the original tweet. But they won't get rid of the original retweet because that's been retweeted and shared and that's, you know, spreading. Another pattern, besides the track change is, as you can imagine, a more visible, hey, you know, three edits have been applied to this - a big button or maybe a sneak peek at that, or maybe you see them side by side. Although then you're trying to compare, what's different? So I think there's a lot of ways to tackle it. INSKEEP: Michael Leggett, who's in favor of an edit button for Twitter. He says everybody is different here. His wife is very careful. She reviews her emails before sending them, which he does not. LEGGETT: I very often hit send and then, you know, realize the, you know, massive typos I've made and wish I could take it back, which is actually what - I worked on Gmail once upon a time and helped build undo send for that very reason. INSKEEP: (Laughter) I've been sitting here wondering that - if you invented that, if you developed that, because of your wife. LEGGETT: It wasn't because of my wife. I actually sent an email to a high-up executive at Google that I wish I had not. They sent my team an email. I was drafting a reply. I had, like, four different possible tacks on the email, and I was like, oh, this is a a mess. I'm, like, coming across too angry. I'll finish it later and hit save, except I hit send. INSKEEP: (Laughter). LEGGETT: And so wish I could - immediately wished I could. . . INSKEEP: So sorry to laugh but. . . LEGGETT: Oh, no, it's hilarious. It is hilarious. INSKEEP: (Laughter). LEGGETT: And she was very gracious because I immediately replied and said, I'm sorry, ignore that, didn't mean to send that. So Gmail had undo on so many different features, which was just such a great design pattern. And so I started wanting an undo on send itself, which we were able to get done. INSKEEP: Well, Michael Leggett, I'm done with the conversation, but before we go away, is there anything in this conversation you would like to undo, edit or change? LEGGETT: (Laughter) No, I feel good about it. I mean, you know, I would only add that it's a hard problem. I think that there's going to be a lot of, you know, people outside of Twitter, myself included, telling them that, oh, but it's easy to do - just do this. And there's always more to it. You know, honestly, it's better to do it than to not do it, but it's better to not do it than to do it poorly. So it's important that it's done well. INSKEEP: All right. Mr. Leggett, thanks so much. LEGGETT: You're welcome. Have a good one. INSKEEP: Michael Leggett is a former design lead and manager at Google and Facebook.

The Tesla CEO is the richest man in the world, and he's repeatedly tweeted to his millions of followers what he plans to change at the company. NPR tech reporter Bobby Allyn joined us to offer some insights into why. BOBBY ALLYN, BYLINE: It's a coveted piece of internet real estate, so it's a status boost to own it, and Musk thinks he can make it better. Now, Musk is already CEO of the world's most valuable car company, Tesla, and, you know, he runs a very successful rocket ship company, SpaceX. But in his spare time, he likes to play on Twitter, sending out jokes and memes and promotional stuff to his more than 80 million followers. So he's a power user of Twitter, right? But, you know, as a business, Twitter has been struggling for a while. So Musk says he can make it a better business. And if shareholders and regulators approve, you know, he's going to have a real shot at it. So we'll see what happens there. In his statement announcing the purchase of Twitter, Musk described it as being a digital town square that he thinks should have fewer rules. In the same statement, Musk said that free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy. FADEL: And a lot of people have expressed concern about what that could mean - the implication, of course, being that Twitter right now is not a welcome place for free speech. But is that actually true? ALLYN: Yeah, I think it's fair to say that Musk is exaggerating quite a bit. There are rules on Twitter, right? You can't harass people. You can't bully. You can't incite violence. You can't spread misinformation about things like COVID-19. But for the most part, you know, a lot of edgy and toxic and offensive material is allowed on Twitter, but apparently not enough for Musk. So he wants to radically open the floodgates to all sorts of content on Twitter. And he hasn't specifically spelled out what he means, but he has said, you know, tweets that are sort of in the gray zone of Twitter's rules, as long as it's not illegal, he says those tweets should be allowed on Twitter. FADEL: So it sounds like it could be possible that things like hate speech would be allowed on Twitter under Elon Musk's vision of unfettered free speech. What else does he say he's going to do? ALLYN: Yeah, he wants to open-source Twitter's algorithm - that's the software code that determines what goes viral - so, you know, anyone can look at it. OK, that's one thing. Another proposal he's floated is to let people edit their tweets after they're sent, which is pretty controversial. You know, on the one hand, you can clean up typos after a tweet is sent. I know, personally, that would be a relief to me. (LAUGHTER)FADEL: I'm full of typos all the time. ALLYN: Exactly. But on the other hand, you could imagine people going back and editing tweets to cover up, say, you know, harassing someone to make it look like it never happened. Another Musk proposal that almost nobody is against is a crackdown on Twitter bots. Those are the anonymous accounts that can sort of gang up on people and attack them en masse on the platform. It's pretty unpleasant. And I think it's fair to say that there's a user consensus that fewer bots on Twitter is a good thing. FADEL: OK, but how about people who've been banned from Twitter, prominent people like former President Trump? Would this mean he'd be allowed back? ALLYN: Yeah, that's the question on everyone's mind. Musk hasn't publicly addressed whether Trump is going to come back. Trump, for his part, told Fox News that he has no plans to return, but we shall see. I mean, you know, from Trump on down, there could be invitations to these people who have been banned to come back to the platform, but we just have to see. There was an all-hands meeting on Monday, and Twitter's CEO was asked specifically about Trump - will he be coming back to Twitter? And the CEO said, that is now completely up to Elon Musk, as are so many things about Twitter's future right now. FADEL: NPR's Bobby Allyn. Bobby, thanks. ALLYN: Hey, thanks so much. LEILA FADEL, HOST:   Elon Musk said he wants to, quote, \"unlock Twitter's potential,\" and he's reached a deal to buy the social network for $44 billion while saying he'll take the company private. The Tesla CEO is the richest man in the world, and he's repeatedly tweeted to his millions of followers what he plans to change at the company. NPR tech reporter Bobby Allyn joined us to offer some insights into why. BOBBY ALLYN, BYLINE: It's a coveted piece of internet real estate, so it's a status boost to own it, and Musk thinks he can make it better. Now, Musk is already CEO of the world's most valuable car company, Tesla, and, you know, he runs a very successful rocket ship company, SpaceX. But in his spare time, he likes to play on Twitter, sending out jokes and memes and promotional stuff to his more than 80 million followers. So he's a power user of Twitter, right? But, you know, as a business, Twitter has been struggling for a while. So Musk says he can make it a better business. And if shareholders and regulators approve, you know, he's going to have a real shot at it. So we'll see what happens there. In his statement announcing the purchase of Twitter, Musk described it as being a digital town square that he thinks should have fewer rules. In the same statement, Musk said that free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy. FADEL: And a lot of people have expressed concern about what that could mean - the implication, of course, being that Twitter right now is not a welcome place for free speech. But is that actually true? ALLYN: Yeah, I think it's fair to say that Musk is exaggerating quite a bit. There are rules on Twitter, right? You can't harass people. You can't bully. You can't incite violence. You can't spread misinformation about things like COVID-19. But for the most part, you know, a lot of edgy and toxic and offensive material is allowed on Twitter, but apparently not enough for Musk. So he wants to radically open the floodgates to all sorts of content on Twitter. And he hasn't specifically spelled out what he means, but he has said, you know, tweets that are sort of in the gray zone of Twitter's rules, as long as it's not illegal, he says those tweets should be allowed on Twitter.

There are lots of questions about what the world's richest person plans to do with the social network. For some answers, let's turn to NPR tech correspondent Shannon Bond. Hey, Shannon. SHANNON BOND, BYLINE: Hey, Rob. SCHMITZ: Shannon, how did this deal come together in the end? BOND: Well, I mean, ultimately, Twitter's board looked at Musk's offer and decided it was a good deal. And remember - it was only early April when Musk, who himself is a prolific Twitter user - he has more than 83 million followers - he revealed he'd been accumulating the stake in Twitter. And less than two weeks ago, he came in with an offer to buy the whole company, and that sent the board into crisis mode, right? Like, was Musk serious? Was this a fair price? Is there a better offer or a different option out there? But the board and Musk reportedly met over the weekend and into today to hammer out the details. And in the end, this all came together quite quickly. SCHMITZ: It certainly did. You know, there's been a lot of back-and-forth over the past couple of weeks, and it seemed like Twitter did not want Musk to take it over. What changed? BOND: Yeah. I mean, Elon Musk is polarizing, to say the least. This whole saga has been polarizing. And the board had actually even put in place what's called a poison pill to try to block Musk from buying more of the company. And that was partly to buy themselves time to consider this deal. It appears what changed is that last week, Musk laid out his financing plan, showing he was serious. You know, he's got several banks promising loans. He's going to put in his own cash. And at that point, I think the board had to take the offer much more seriously. Now, Musk offered $54. 20 a share, and that's a lot higher than what Twitter has been trading at for most of this year. So today, with the announcement, Twitter Chairman Brett Taylor said, you know, this is a big premium, and the board does believe this is the best path forward for shareholders. SCHMITZ: So what does Musk plan to do with Twitter? Has he said anything about making any changes? BOND: He's said lots of things. He's tweeted lots of ideas. His biggest priority seems to be around Twitter's rules about what people can post. Now, you know, in that, Twitter is pretty much in line with the other big social networks, but Musk thinks these kind of restrictions are excessive. And in today's announcement, you know, he described free speech as the bedrock of democracy and Twitter as, quote, \"the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated. \" So Musk says he thinks Twitter should allow all legal speech. You know, Rob, here in the U. S. , that would mean leaving up things like paid speech, harassment, state-backed disinformation, spam. These are all things the platform currently limits or removes. Now, what Musk has not said is what he would do to fix Twitter's fundamental business problem, which is, you know, this is pretty much a niche platform that struggles to make money. It may be influential and drive a lot of news and culture. It does not have a lot of users. You know, Facebook has about 10 - more than 10 times as many users as Twitter. And Twitter has tried but not been able to broaden its reach among users or advertisers. And, you know, this company is unprofitable. That's the core problem here. SCHMITZ: That is fascinating. You know, how are people reacting to this deal? BOND: Well, all of Musk's talk about free speech in this whole saga, you know, has fueled a lot of speculation that former President Donald Trump could return to Twitter. Now, remember, you know, he was - previously was one of Twitter's, you know, most influential, loudest users, and he was banned after the January 6 Capitol riot. But today, Trump said he is not going back to Twitter. Meanwhile, inside Twitter, you know, we're hearing just lots of uncertainty. You know, there are employees who are fans of Musk, but many employees are really wary of these changes. Leadership has kept very quiet during this entire saga with Musk, and a lot of staff are frustrated. They want to know what this means for their future, for - you know, who's going to run Twitter, what's going to happen to their stock options. Twitter's CEO and chairman are holding an all-staff meeting, so I think they're going to be facing a lot of questions from employees about all of these issues. SCHMITZ: Lots of uncertainty.

In a tweet - where else? - Elon Musk said, quote, \"I hope that even my worst critics remain on Twitter because that is what free speech means. \" Well, those critics point out that Twitter can be rife with disinformation and racism and harassment, and they question whether Elon Musk is the right person to address those problems. Among those questioning, Anand Giridharadas - he's author of the book \"Winners Take All: The Elite Charade Of Changing The World\" and wrote about the acquisition for The New York Times opinion section. Anand, welcome. ANAND GIRIDHARADAS: Thank you so much for having me. KELLY: All right. So when Elon Musk says he wants to promote free speech on the platform, that seems like a good idea in principle. Why does it raise a red flag for you? GIRIDHARADAS: Free speech is a great concept. And I'm a big supporter, as I know you are. You work in the business of it, as do I. But free speech has become a dog whistle in American life in recent years, and Elon Musk means it in a much more specific way. And he's been much more specific about it. And what he's talking about is the feeling that what is, frankly, content moderation on sites like Twitter and other social media platforms is suppressing free speech. In other words, efforts that have been made to clamp down on very real problems that you and I see on Twitter every day - which is Nazi speech going unchecked, racism going unchecked, disinformation going unchecked, misogyny, rape threats to women who've made the mistake of having opinions going unchecked - there have been modest - inadequate, but modest efforts in recent years to clamp down. And Elon Musk thinks that kind of reform, which actually allows more people to speak more freely and safely, is the problem. KELLY: You actually take this a little bit farther in your piece for the Times. I want to quote one line. You ask, what happens when the incarnation of a problem buys the right to decide what the problem is and how to fix it? I mean, you're - just to take one example - the bullying and harassment problem on Twitter. Why is Musk the wrong person to fix that? GIRIDHARADAS: It's not only the wrong person, it is the perfect embodiment of the problem, right? So I kind of focused on three in the piece. And when I talk to people who work at Twitter, these are the three they're thinking about, right? So Twitter has a disinformation problem by its own acknowledgment, right? And Elon Musk has shown himself to be someone who spreads falsehoods. Twitter has a racism problem, which, again, Twitter has fessed up to and has tried to fix and not done enough, but owned up to the fact that it is working to make it a less bigoted, harassing place for people of color. Elon Musk runs a company that the California Department of Fair Housing and Employment recently said is a segregated workplace; not awkward, not mean - segregated. And Twitter has a bullying and harassment problem, as particularly women and people of color experience every day. And Elon Musk is the incarnation of that kind of social media behavior, siccing his followers on people who disagree with him. . . KELLY: A recent tweet against Bill Gates, for example. GIRIDHARADAS: . . . Living in a kind of perpetual adolescence. KELLY: Belittling. . . GIRIDHARADAS: Correct. KELLY: . . . Bill Gates. Just - I mean, setting aside for the moment, you know, the question of Elon Musk and whether he's the right man for the job, are you assigning too much power to Twitter? I mean, most Americans aren't even on Twitter. How does this affect them? GIRIDHARADAS: Twitter is incredibly powerful in certain ways. It's not powerful in the way that network television was in the '70s with, you know, 40 million people watching the same thing. But it is. I think Elon Musk is correct when he calls it the closest we have to some kind of global town square. And now one rich guy has bought the thing he described as the town square. Town square's necessarily a kind of public thing. And so the problem is he is going to have a disproportionate power to shape discourse, shape journalism, shape how people think about public problems. And a man who embodies many of our biggest public problems is going to have the chance to shape the solution. . . KELLY: Right. GIRIDHARADAS: . . . To those problems. . . KELLY: Just a couple seconds. . . GIRIDHARADAS: . . . And to veto solutions that threaten him. KELLY: Sorry - just a couple seconds left. So a yes or no question, are you going to stay on Twitter? GIRIDHARADAS: I will stay on Twitter, and I hope Elon Musk does not. KELLY: We will leave it there. Anand Giridharadas, author of the book \"Winners Take All\" - it was a pleasure.

So some researchers are hoping video games could help treat cognitive disorders from depression and ADHD to mental decline from aging. Keller Gordon reported about this for npr. org. Welcome, Keller. KELLER GORDON, BYLINE: Hi, Rob. Thanks for having me. SCHMITZ: Keller, you start by describing a video game developed at a lab at the University of Utah. Tell us about that. GORDON: Yeah. So this isn't a game you get on the app store or PlayStation or anything like that. It's from a federally funded nonprofit lab that makes games dedicated to treating cognitive disorders, mostly those in aging brains. I spoke with Dr. Sarah Morimoto, who runs this program called Neurogrow. It doesn't exactly look like a normal video game. You've got a basic, colorful screen, and you might have to complete certain tasks, like watering a flower with a certain color watering can before time runs out. It's got a pretty rudimentary design, but it challenges a patient's memory and reaction time. And it's not supposed to be fun. It's therapy. But Dr. Morimoto thinks the results are promising. SARAH MORIMOTO: I definitely feel like the science has been greatly advanced by working with video game researchers and designers. SCHMITZ: So, Keller, that's the researcher. What do her patients say? What did you hear from them? GORDON: Yeah. I spoke with Pete and Pam Stevens about their experience using the Neurogrow program. Pam had suffered a stroke in 2014 and wasn't responding to medication. Her neurologist gave them a pretty grim prognosis. PETE STEVENS: He on two separate occasions over a two-year period had said there was nothing we could do. Just take her home and be prepared. She's going to die. SCHMITZ: Geez. GORDON: Yeah, it's pretty rough. But they weren't ready to give up. They found out about Morimoto's program in 2018. And after a few Neurogrow sessions, Pam would be exhausted, like she had just finished a workout. But it was helping. Now, Pam didn't say much to me in our interview. But Pete says he started noticing improvements in her mental health. Before our interview, Pete mentioned that Pam was actually reading a book on cognitive behavioral therapy. SCHMITZ: Wow. That's a really good sign. So that's a government-funded project. Are private companies getting into video game therapy as well? GORDON: Yeah. Let me tell you about one of them. There is Akili Interactive Labs, a very different organization with very different funding. They developed a game called EndeavorRx. This looks more like a popular mobile game, like Subway Surfers, or a game that's actually, you know, supposed to be fun. SCHMITZ: Right. GORDON: And the FDA actually gave EndeavorRx their blessing. They classified it as something that could be used to treat inattention in children with ADHD. But there are also critics. Some scientists call it a marketing ploy. They say patients who play the game will only really get better at playing games like it, like Mario Kart. Here's how Eddie Martucci, CEO of Akili, responded to that criticism. EDDIE MARTUCCI: I think the reason there's skepticism is people have been burned by, like, marketing gimmicks, especially in digital health and especially in neuroscience and areas like ADHD. There's been a lot of snake oil, and over time, skepticism has dramatically decreased as we continue to research and show data. SCHMITZ: So that makes sense. But where is this all going? Are we getting to the point where you will see video games prescribed by a doctor? GORDON: Well, theoretically, the FDA has already allowed that for EndeavorRx. The company behind it got hundreds of millions of new capital in a merger. Dr. Morimoto's lab - again, out of a university - is very different. They follow an academic path. And Neurogrow is an experimental therapy that's still only available to a few patients. But they've got a lot of government funding - a $7. 5 million grant. So watch this space. It's very likely to keep growing. SCHMITZ: We will continue to watch. That's Keller Gordon, who contributes to NPR's video game coverage. Thank you so much, Keller. GORDON: Thank you.

KELLER GORDON, BYLINE: Hi, Rob. Thanks for having me. SCHMITZ: Keller, you start by describing a video game developed at a lab at the University of Utah. Tell us about that. GORDON: Yeah. So this isn't a game you get on the app store or PlayStation or anything like that. It's from a federally funded nonprofit lab that makes games dedicated to treating cognitive disorders, mostly those in aging brains. I spoke with Dr. Sarah Morimoto, who runs this program called Neurogrow. It doesn't exactly look like a normal video game. You've got a basic, colorful screen, and you might have to complete certain tasks, like watering a flower with a certain color watering can before time runs out. It's got a pretty rudimentary design, but it challenges a patient's memory and reaction time. And it's not supposed to be fun. It's therapy. But Dr. Morimoto thinks the results are promising. SARAH MORIMOTO: I definitely feel like the science has been greatly advanced by working with video game researchers and designers. SCHMITZ: So, Keller, that's the researcher. What do her patients say? What did you hear from them? GORDON: Yeah. I spoke with Pete and Pam Stevens about their experience using the Neurogrow program. Pam had suffered a stroke in 2014 and wasn't responding to medication. Her neurologist gave them a pretty grim prognosis. PETE STEVENS: He on two separate occasions over a two-year period had said there was nothing we could do. Just take her home and be prepared. She's going to die. SCHMITZ: Geez. GORDON: Yeah, it's pretty rough. But they weren't ready to give up. They found out about Morimoto's program in 2018. And after a few Neurogrow sessions, Pam would be exhausted, like she had just finished a workout. But it was helping. Now, Pam didn't say much to me in our interview. But Pete says he started noticing improvements in her mental health. Before our interview, Pete mentioned that Pam was actually reading a book on cognitive behavioral therapy. SCHMITZ: Wow. That's a really good sign. So that's a government-funded project. Are private companies getting into video game therapy as well? GORDON: Yeah. Let me tell you about one of them. There is Akili Interactive Labs, a very different organization with very different funding. They developed a game called EndeavorRx. This looks more like a popular mobile game, like Subway Surfers, or a game that's actually, you know, supposed to be fun. SCHMITZ: Right. GORDON: And the FDA actually gave EndeavorRx their blessing. They classified it as something that could be used to treat inattention in children with ADHD. But there are also critics. Some scientists call it a marketing ploy. They say patients who play the game will only really get better at playing games like it, like Mario Kart. Here's how Eddie Martucci, CEO of Akili, responded to that criticism. EDDIE MARTUCCI: I think the reason there's skepticism is people have been burned by, like, marketing gimmicks, especially in digital health and especially in neuroscience and areas like ADHD. There's been a lot of snake oil, and over time, skepticism has dramatically decreased as we continue to research and show data. SCHMITZ: So that makes sense. But where is this all going? Are we getting to the point where you will see video games prescribed by a doctor? GORDON: Well, theoretically, the FDA has already allowed that for EndeavorRx. The company behind it got hundreds of millions of new capital in a merger. Dr. Morimoto's lab - again, out of a university - is very different. They follow an academic path. And Neurogrow is an experimental therapy that's still only available to a few patients. But they've got a lot of government funding - a $7. 5 million grant. So watch this space. It's very likely to keep growing. SCHMITZ: We will continue to watch. That's Keller Gordon, who contributes to NPR's video game coverage. Thank you so much, Keller. GORDON: Thank you.

The EU recently advanced rules that would force companies like Facebook, Twitter and YouTube to crack down on misinformation and hate speech or face multibillion-dollar fines. NPR tech reporter Bobby Allyn joins us to explain what the new law does and how it could eventually change how everyone uses social media. Good morning, Bobby. BOBBY ALLYN, BYLINE: Hey, Ayesha. RASCOE: So this is called the Digital Services Act, but it isn't the first time European lawmakers have moved to kind of rein in the tech industry, right? ALLYN: So European regulators have already passed laws aimed at tech privacy and the dominance of Big Tech. So this is actually the third sweeping tech law in recent years. And it's looking at the societal effects of tech platforms, and it's really a huge deal. It affects social media, search engines and lots of other platforms, big and small. RASCOE: OK, so tell us exactly what this new law calls for. ALLYN: Sure. So let's focus on, you know, the social media companies that, you know, we all know and use every day - Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Twitter. This law adds a new regulator that the companies will actually be paying for themselves to make sure that illegal content is taken down quickly - stuff like terrorism and hate speech. So, you know, attacking someone based on their race or religion - that's illegal in Europe. The law also makes the companies share tons of internal data with researchers, like how platforms are dealing with misinformation. It also calls for an independent auditor to do an annual review of how Big Tech is complying. But, you know, this isn't some, you know, ho-hum boring audit. If the companies are found to be dragging their feet, they could be fined up to 6% of global revenue. I mean, that's billions of dollars, enough to really hurt these companies. I talked about the new rules with Daphne Keller. She's with Stanford's Cyber Policy Center, and she previously was a top lawyer at Google. DAPHNE KELLER: It is a very major stick. So to the extent that platforms haven't been taking European regulation seriously enough, this is a reason to take it more seriously. RASCOE: Yeah, billions of dollars would likely do that. So these stiff penalties would be for keeping up hate speech and other content that's illegal in the EU. Like, what else does the law do? ALLYN: Yeah, it's a really dizzying law 'cause there's just so many parts to it. But two things that were really interesting to me when I looked over some of the particulars have to do with advertising and what we're served up on social media. The law bans targeting minors with any ads at all and also prevents ads from profiling people based on gender, ethnicity or sexual orientation, which is a huge change from how targeted ads work right now. I mean, social media companies make almost all their money from advertising, so this could really cut into their profits eventually. And on the second point, what the platforms recommend to us - the law says if people want to be able to opt out of personalized feeds - you know, when you go on TikTok or Instagram or something, and you see a social media post that's, like, a little too creepy because it seems to know a little too much about us - that in Europe, people should be able to opt out of that kind of stuff. It gives people the power to say, you know what? I don't like the way that TikTok or YouTube is recommending content to me, so I want out. RASCOE: That sounds like a pretty big change. Like, how have tech companies responded? ALLYN: Well, lobbyists for Big Tech fought hard to have the law watered down. They were not successful. All 27 EU countries have agreed on the language of this law. And it's moving towards final approval in the European Parliament. And now the companies say they will all comply with the new rules. RASCOE: And so here in the U. S. , are lawmakers looking at this and maybe potentially thinking about following suit? ALLYN: Oh, they're absolutely watching, but that might be about it. In Washington, it's all talk and little action when it comes to tech. I mean, consider this fact, Ayesha - in the past 25 years, Congress has passed just two very narrow tech regulations - one about children's privacy and another on sex trafficking. Lawmakers just can't seem to agree on anything else. Now, there is a chance this EU law will prompt copycat legislation in other countries and maybe eventually trigger some kind of action in the U. S. Some experts say if the tech companies are forced to make these big changes for people in Europe, then, you know, it shouldn't be that big of a deal to make it the global norm. So we'll see how that goes. But, you know, Congress may be inspired to pass a new tech regulation. But if that happens, I'll be sure to be back with an update. RASCOE: And we'll look forward to talking to you again if that's the case. That's NPR tech reporter Bobby Allyn. Thank you so much. ALLYN: Thank you.

More and more of them are picking up riders on the city's streets. NPR tech reporter Bobby Allyn went to check them out. BOBBY ALLYN, BYLINE: A video went viral last month. In it San Francisco, police pull over a car with its headlights on. As officers approached the vehicle, someone shouts at them. (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Ain't nobody in it. ALLYN: Ain't nobody in it. Now, I'm watching the video of the bewildered police officers with UC Berkeley transportation researcher Steven Shladover. STEVEN SHLADOVER: One of them looking on the driver's side, one looking in the front, and I guess this is where they realized there's no driver in the vehicle. ALLYN: When the officers walk away, the car pulls ahead and parks with its hazards on. SHLADOVER: I believe the vehicle actually responded quite well. ALLYN: Which is a relief to Mo Elshenawy. He's an engineering executive at Cruise, the General Motors' own self-driving car company. It was one of his company's cars that police were pulling over, and the technology worked as it was supposed to. He says roads would be safer if more cars were self-driving. MO ELSHENAWY: Your cars would never get angry or tired or frustrated or do a California roll on a stop sign. ALLYN: Self-driving car companies have been promising for years that we're on the cusp of a driverless car future, and it just hasn't happened. But in San Francisco, the technology has hit a milestone. Fully self-driving cars have gotten approval to taxi people around. So I thought I'd give it a try. Cruise has an application process, and I wasn't selected, so I tried Waymo, the company owned by Google. LINDSAY: Please buckle up.

SANDY KARP: No. So the Waymo driver or the technology is. . . ALLYN: What do you mean - sorry. What do you mean Waymo driver? What do you mean by that? KARP: So the Waymo driver is what we call our autonomous driving suite, so. . . ALLYN: So a robot. KARP: Exactly. The robot. ALLYN: It was kind of confusing to me that she kept calling the software operating the car the Waymo driver. From the outside, you'd never know that Lindsay wasn't doing anything but sitting there. Sure, it looks like she's driving, but she's not. And the ride was smooth. There was just one thing that stuck out to me. So 23 miles per hour - that's what people complain about, that these cars go too slow. KARP: So we also want to provide a comfortable driving experience for our riders. So what we've heard from our riders is that when you're barreling down a hill, they'd actually prefer to go a little slower. ALLYN: This, after all, is San Francisco, a city known for its dramatic hills. Waymo's cars have been trained to take them extra cautiously. The short span in the robot Jaguar was over, and we got out. Thank you. KARP: Thank you so much. ALLYN: Appreciate it.

Maayan Silver with WUWM in Milwaukee tells us all about it. MAAYAN SILVER, BYLINE: Cree Myles is always thinking about new ways to get people to read books by Black authors. One example of her creative approach, this freestyle rap session called a cypher. The Milwaukee-based book influencer posted the video to her Instagram account, All Ways Black. Here she is with Milwaukee rapper Genesis Renji. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)CREE MYLES: This is the All Ways Black cypher 2022. We got Black. We got books. We got Black books. Gen, take it away. GENESIS RENJI: (Rapping) All Ways Black. My mom taught me to that. And pages I will turn, said if you can read, then you can lead. Ain't nothing you can't learn. MYLES: Yes. I watch it every day. That's like - I'm almost prouder of that than my children (laughter). SILVER: The Instagram account All Ways Black is a collaboration between Myles and book giant Penguin Random House. Myles first partnered with the company last year when she organized a read-a-thon of Toni Morrison's books. The late author was published by Knopf, now part of Penguin Random House. A few months later, the company offered Myles a job curating an Instagram platform centered on Black books. Myles calls the platform All Ways Black thanks to her husband, who came up with the name about 20 seconds after she was offered the job. MYLES: And he was like, how about just All Ways Black? Like, all the ways? So it was that quick. And for me, it's an aural check to make sure that I'm not just doing Cree's Black. SILVER: Now, Myles has cultivated a space that includes interactive read-a-thons, chats with authors, photos and lists of new releases and other creative content about Black lit, like this word of the week video about the word ephemeral that she gleaned from Brandon Taylor's book \"Filthy Animals. \" It's set to rapper Saweetie's 2020 song \"Tap In. \"(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MYLES: (Rapping) Kim K's marriage.

SILVER: Myles' work was nominated for a Webby, which honors excellence on the internet, and a Shorty, which recognizes the best work in social and digital media.

SILVER: Myles immediately jokes that an interview with Ta-Nehisi Coates is the biggest flex of all time.

But it's also like you're the literary Beyonce, so. . . COATES: You know what? You know what? You need to tell them streets they need to dream a little bigger. (LAUGHTER)SILVER: Myles has a breezy interview style, connecting with authors personally and asking sharp questions about their works. It's a mixture of natural talent, preparation and an earnest respect for writers who she believes deserve the celebrity of singers or actors. MYLES: I'm all about glamorizing Black literature and the writers. Like, they give us such important stories. They should be treated accordingly. SILVER: She says Black authors know what it's like to be a person of color. MYLES: I think a lot of times when you're just moving throughout the world as a Black person, as a Black woman, things are happening to you every day. And they rub you a certain way, but you have nothing to validate whether or not your feelings are justified. SILVER: She found that validation reading Toni Morrison's \"The Bluest Eye\" many years ago. MYLES: I'm reading it, and I was like, yes. And yes. And yes. I'm not crazy. That was a seminal moment in my life, for sure. SILVER: In championing Black books, she's developed an engaged community and the respect of fellow book influencers. Traci Thomas runs the popular \"Stacks\" podcast. TRACI THOMAS: Often, other things I've seen on publishing platforms, they might, you know, have a Black intern, and then they post something that, you know, uses Black vernacular, but is very - feels very hollow. All Ways Black feels super authentic. SILVER: Myles is functioning in a publishing world that's still three-quarters white, according to a 2019 survey by Lee and Low. Seventy-six percent of the books Penguin Random House released from 2019 to 2021 were by white creators. All Ways Black has proven to be an important way for the company to promote its Black works and branch out to new audiences. Myles consistently thinks about those who don't yet see themselves as readers. She wants people to know that great books are for everyone. MYLES: Like, you wouldn't say, oh, I can't listen to Whitney Houston. Her voice is too good. I don't get it. And it's the same way when you're reading James Baldwin or Toni Morrison. SILVER: Or, says Myles, many of the authors writing the Black canon today. For NPR News, I'm Maayan Silver in Milwaukee. MARTINEZ: And by way of disclosure, NPR receives underwriting support from Penguin Random House. A MARTINEZ, HOST:   On Instagram's Bookstagram handle, there's a new project to celebrate Black writers. Maayan Silver with WUWM in Milwaukee tells us all about it. MAAYAN SILVER, BYLINE: Cree Myles is always thinking about new ways to get people to read books by Black authors. One example of her creative approach, this freestyle rap session called a cypher. The Milwaukee-based book influencer posted the video to her Instagram account, All Ways Black. Here she is with Milwaukee rapper Genesis Renji. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CREE MYLES: This is the All Ways Black cypher 2022. We got Black. We got books. We got Black books. Gen, take it away. GENESIS RENJI: (Rapping) All Ways Black. My mom taught me to that. And pages I will turn, said if you can read, then you can lead. Ain't nothing you can't learn. MYLES: Yes. I watch it every day. That's like - I'm almost prouder of that than my children (laughter). SILVER: The Instagram account All Ways Black is a collaboration between Myles and book giant Penguin Random House. Myles first partnered with the company last year when she organized a read-a-thon of Toni Morrison's books. The late author was published by Knopf, now part of Penguin Random House. A few months later, the company offered Myles a job curating an Instagram platform centered on Black books. Myles calls the platform All Ways Black thanks to her husband, who came up with the name about 20 seconds after she was offered the job. MYLES: And he was like, how about just All Ways Black?

Well, today President Biden says his administration is trying to make sure everyone can afford the internet. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: And that's why the bipartisan infrastructure law included $65 billion to make sure we expand access to broadband internet in every region of the country - urban, suburban and rural, everywhere. CHANG: Biden was joined in the Rose Garden by a slew of internet providers who have agreed to cut their prices for low-income people. Well, we're joined now by Chris Lewis. He works with the advocacy group Public Knowledge, which has been pushing for greater access to affordable internet. Welcome. CHRIS LEWIS: Thanks for having me, Ailsa. CHANG: Well, thanks for being with us. So the president says that there are now a bunch of companies on board to lower internet costs. What's your general reaction to the news today? Like, how significant is this development? LEWIS: This is an important but, we should note, small step towards closing the digital divide. As the president noted, the $65 billion that was invested takes some great strides towards deploying broadband to areas that don't have it. But the announcement today was focused on the affordability problem. The cost of broadband is one of the leading causes for why many people who have access don't sign up. This voluntary pledge today from broadband providers is a good first start to make sure that there is a low-cost option. So there will be relief for some here, but we still have a long way to go to make sure that broadband is affordable. And the president, I think, noted that at the end of his speech. CHANG: I understand the administration already started a program that offers low-income families a $30-per-month subsidy. . . LEWIS: Right. CHANG: . . . To help pay for internet service. And something like 11. 5 million people are using that stipend now. But another 30 million, I gather, are eligible. So why is there such a gap there between the amount of people who are eligible for this subsidy and the amount of people who are actually availing themselves of it? LEWIS: Right. This program that you're talking about with the $30 subsidy has only been around for about a year or so. We have a ways to go to grow the outreach so that folks understand that that option's available. CHANG: Is that the main problem - that the word just hasn't spread about the availability of this stipend? LEWIS: Exactly. And that's why these partnerships with nonprofit organizations and other local groups are so important. I think of groups like the National Digital Inclusion Alliance, which has chapters in every state, doing work at libraries and community centers, reaching people on the ground. They may have chapters who can help people get connected and sign up for these low-cost programs with broadband providers. So it's going to take a real public-private effort. CHANG: How affordable is this new program, really? Like, if you factor in the required fees that come with signing up for internet access, does this program really lower the costs in a meaningful way? LEWIS: Let's hope so for the folks who qualify. You know, the reports today from the White House were that the commitment - and, again, it's a voluntary commitment by a number of broadband providers - was that it would be a $30 broadband plan all-in is how we heard it put. And that's great. Now, there are folks people who do not qualify for this. And so they'll still be paying the three and four times the cost that we see for high-speed broadband in the general marketplace. And so that's why I think we have a ways to go to actually study and see why broadband is so expensive for everyone and also what the impact is of having so few choices in the broadband marketplace. CHANG: All right. That is Chris Lewis. He is the president of the advocacy group Public Knowledge. Thank you very much for joining us today. LEWIS: Thank you, Ailsa. CHANG: And to find out if you might qualify for this $30-a-month program, head over to getinternet. gov or call 877-384-2575.

That announcement sent Twitter stock plunging, creating fresh turmoil for the company. NPR tech correspondent Shannon Bond joins us now to unpack what is going on. Hey, Shannon. SHANNON BOND, BYLINE: Hey, Ailsa. CHANG: OK. So why does Elon Musk say he's putting this whole deal on hold now? BOND: Well, in a tweet, of course, Musk said he has questions about just how many Twitter accounts are fake or tweeting spam. Now, Twitter regularly discloses how many fake accounts it has. And, you know, this is a number that matters because Twitter's business is selling ads, and advertisers don't want to pay for ads that aren't being seen by real people. In its latest filing, Twitter says less than 5% of accounts are fake. But Musk has said that getting rid of spam and automated bot accounts is a priority for how he wants to change Twitter. And so now he's saying he wants to look into these numbers himself. And so that's why he's putting this deal on hold. CHANG: OK. So does this actually mean Musk might not buy Twitter after all? BOND: Well, in a follow-up tweet, he said he is still committed to the deal. But look, Ailsa; Twitter's shares tanked today on this news. They're down more than 9%. And that suggests investors are worried that Musk is maybe having second thoughts about this deal. CHANG: So why would he change his mind? BOND: Well, look; this purchase is getting more expensive and risky. You know, Musk has committed to paying $21 billion out of this purchase price. He said he's going to do that by selling and borrowing against some of his shares in Tesla, the electric car company where he's CEO and the source of much of his wealth. But Tesla's stock price has dropped by almost a third since the Twitter deal was announced. And on top of that, there has been this wider sell-off in the market that's hit tech stocks especially hard. Here's what Angelo Zino, an analyst at CFRA Research, told me. ANGELO ZINO: With Tesla's stock kind of petering here in recent weeks, I think that's also had a impact on Musk's, you know, personal wealth. And, you know, the combination of the two, I think, would naturally kind of give an individual like Elon Musk cold feet. CHANG: Cold feet - but can Musk just walk away from this deal easy peasy? BOND: Well, he would have to pay a $1 billion breakup fee to Twitter with, you know, very few exceptions. CHANG: OK. BOND: And experts tell me that even if he did that, he could still be sued for breach of contract, be on the hook for even more money. So some people think it's much more likely Musk may be using this issue as leverage to renegotiate his offer price, basically to pay less. And this is not the way that big corporate deals typically play out. Here's what Donna Hitscherich, a professor at Columbia Business School, told me. DONNA HITSCHERICH: Generally speaking, people don't sign merger agreements so they can walk away from them. They sign merger agreements so they can do deals. So I guess the question is, is this a bargaining issue, or is this really a do-or-die, I have to renegotiate the deal or I'm going to try to terminate the merger agreement? BOND: Of course, though, this is Elon Musk we're talking about. You know, he often operates on gut instinct, so it's hard to say what he's going to do next. CHANG: So fascinating. OK, so what impact is all of this having on Twitter, the company, at this point? BOND: Well, it's adding to what's already a huge amount of uncertainty. You know, just yesterday, Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal announced a hiring freeze and spending cuts. He also said two top executives are leaving. That's adding to concerns that Musk's potential takeover is going to result in an exodus of employees. Meanwhile, this afternoon Agrawal tweeted he does expect the deal to close, but he says, quote, \"we need to be prepared for all scenarios. \"CHANG: That is NPR's Shannon Bond. Thank you, Shannon.

In about 2 minutes, it was taken down. But then it started reappearing all over the internet. Suppressing violent footage is a constant problem for tech companies. And NPR's Bobby Allyn has been looking into this and joins us. Good morning, Bobby. BOBBY ALLYN, BYLINE: Good morning. MARTIN: Take us through - as horrific as it is - how exactly the Buffalo gunman used social media. ALLYN: Sure. Well, he attached a GoPro camera to a military-style helmet that he wore and began livestreaming as he drove into the parking lot of the grocery store where he would kill 10 people. He used a video streaming service called Twitch. It's owned by Amazon, and it's really big with gamers. And as you mentioned, Twitch did act fast. The company says it removed the stream in less than 2 minutes after the violence started. But that's when the real trouble began, right? It started, you know, just spreading across the internet like wildfire. People were able to save copies of it. On one site called Streamable, the footage was viewed more than 3 million times before it was taken down. And Facebook, Twitter and other social sites rushed to block the video, but some links just managed to get through. MARTIN: I mean, this sounds horrifyingly familiar, though. Well, you remember the shooter in Christchurch, New Zealand, in 2019 also livestreamed his attack. Others have done the same. So why? I mean, aren't social media companies learning from these? ALLYN: Look, there's been progress. But experts say there's just no perfect solution here. After the Christchurch shooting, countries and social platforms banded together and created a shared database of violent material that would make it easier to block something like this. Now, Saturday put that system to the test. And it's hard to know for sure how effective it was. But we do know it was not flawless because versions of the shooter's video kept popping up on Twitter and Facebook. Now, I will say Twitch pulling the livestream down in 2 minutes was remarkable. Past mass shooters who have livestreamed on Twitch have gone more than 30 minutes before the company acted. So their swift action here was indeed applauded, but the speed at which it replicated was just so hard to control. MARTIN: New York's governor, Kathy Hochul, is saying that social media companies actually share some responsibility in the massacre that happened in Buffalo. I want to play a bit of tape. This is her addressing reporters on Saturday. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)KATHY HOCHUL: The social media platforms that profit from their existence need to be responsible for monitoring and having surveillance, knowing that they can be, in a sense, an accomplice to a crime like this, perhaps not legally, but morally. MARTIN: What do you make of that, Bobby? ALLYN: Yeah. There's a few ways to think about it. I mean, in legal terms, online platforms are usually off the hook, right? In most cases, a social media site cannot be sued for hosting comments, or in this case, a video someone posts. But morally, you know, as we heard from the governor there, it's a different debate, right? For a long time, social media companies took a kind of hands-off approach to policing content. And now more than ever, Facebook, Twitter and other social media sites are seriously trying to tackle the societal problems the sites create. All the companies have thousands of content moderators and other systems in place to automatically block violent stuff from ever finding an audience. But the companies have more work to do. I mean, Twitch could make it more difficult to livestream. Right now it's one of the only major video streaming sites that lets you open an account and instantly start livestreaming.

We've heard about why we should repair our products and how we could repurpose oil drilling technology to tap into geothermal power. But what about what we eat? Can we remake what goes on our plates? (SOUNDBITE OF COW MOOING)ERMIAS KEBREAB: Yeah. So I've been working with cows for about 20 years or so. ZOMORODI: This is biologist Ermias Kebreab. Growing up in Eritrea, Ermias saw how important milk and meat were to the nutrition of his family and his community. KEBREAB: The majority of people in the world live in low-income countries where the main source of nutrition, the good nutrition, is an animal source food. I wanted to have ample opportunity for people to drink milk and to eat meat and, you know, basically lead a healthy life. That's what I wanted to do and that's what I studied - biology and agriculture. I've had a relationship with cows for quite a long time. (SOUNDBITE OF COW MOOING)ZOMORODI: Now, Ermias is a professor at UC Davis, where he studies cows, specifically a problem with cows - their burps. (SOUNDBITE OF COW BURPING)ZOMORODI: Those burps are full of methane, one of the greenhouse gases that contributes to climate change. In fact, cows account for 4% of U. S. greenhouse gas emissions every year. I always thought that cows were particularly flatulent. Is this true? KEBREAB: It is not. ZOMORODI: Oh. KEBREAB: So most of the gas is formed in their stomach, so in their guts, particularly in the first chamber. And so they belch it out. By some estimates, between 95% to 97% of the methane comes from the front end of the cow. So the back end of the cow is really maybe 3% or less. (SOUNDBITE OF TRUMPET PLAYING)ZOMORODI: So for the past several years, Ermias and his team have been experimenting with how changing a cow's diet could safely and quickly lower the amount of methane in its belches. Here's Ermias Kebreab on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)KEBREAB: So how can you reduce these methane burps? My colleagues and I may have found a solution - seaweed. Let me explain. A couple of years ago, an article was published that showed almost complete elimination of methane when seaweed was added to chopped grass in the lab. Great. But, as an agricultural researcher, I know lots of additives work well in the lab but not in real animals. But there was something different about seaweed and the way in which it reduced methane. Some seaweeds contain ingredients that directly inhibit microbes in the cow's gut from forming methane without interfering with food digestion. So we thought we should test this in live animals. This was the first ever experiment in dairy cattle, and we had no idea how much to give them. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ZOMORODI: OK. So your team starts mixing in just a little bit of seaweed into the cow's regular feed. And what did the cows think? Like, did they like it? KEBREAB: Well, the ones that we gave too much, they did not eat as much as we would like them to do it. . . ZOMORODI: (Laughter) OK. KEBREAB: Because, you know, just like the - cows are very picky eaters. ZOMORODI: Oh, I didn't know that. KEBREAB: Oh, yeah. They sort their feed. They will find the bits and pieces that they like. ZOMORODI: (Laughter) It's like my dog. KEBREAB: (Laughter) Yeah. ZOMORODI: All right. KEBREAB: So they didn't get used to it right away. But - so we gave them for about three weeks, and then we switched them around and then another three weeks and then we switched them around. And that was it. ZOMORODI: And all the while, though, you're collecting their burps? That's not a sentence I thought I would ever say, Ermias. KEBREAB: (Laughter). ZOMORODI: How do you do that? KEBREAB: The way we do it is, we have a device called GreenFeed. (SOUNDBITE OF COWS MOOING)KEBREAB: And what it does is it will entice them to come to this machine where they feed - they stick their head into this machine, and they feed from that machine. So as soon as they come in, the GreenFeed machine will drop some. . . (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)KEBREAB: . . . What we call cow cookie. So they just eat this cow cookie. As they're eating, they will be breathing into this machine, and the machine will take out their breath. And then, right away, analyze in their burping how much methane, how much carbon dioxide, how much hydrogen there is and then automatically sends that information wirelessly. And the cows love it. I mean, you would see them line up to try to get into this machine. ZOMORODI: (Laughter) OK, great. So you have very willing participants in your study. And what was your hypothesis? What did you sort of hope you would see? KEBREAB: What I was hoping was that we see 10%, 20%, 30% at most reduction in emissions. That would make me very, very happy. But then, when we start doing this, and I start getting this report from my graduate student that the reduction was quite high, I couldn't believe it. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)KEBREAB: In that first experiment, the emissions were reduced by up to 67%. (APPLAUSE)KEBREAB: And I thought, at first, the equipment must have malfunctioned. But it was real. But we are left with more questions than answers. Would the microbes in the gut get used to it and start producing methane over time? Would the seaweed be stable over a long period of time in storage? Would the taste be affected and the cows turn up their noses? Or would the seaweed affect the cows' health or milk production? So we teamed up again to conduct another trial. Over a five-month period, we saw the seaweed reduce emissions by over 80%. (APPLAUSE)KEBREAB: Our colleagues in Australia, they saw up to 98% reduction in a similar trial. That kind of reduction is simply staggering. We have also seen an improvement in bulking up of the beef cattle with no adverse health effects. So it's a win for the environment. It's a win for the farmers and consumers. A panel of 112 people got to taste steak made from steers offered seaweed and control, and they did not detect any difference. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)KEBREAB: We also did a nutritional quality of the meat, and we found no difference between animals that were offered seaweed and the control. ZOMORODI: OK. So you do your first study with cows. It's highly successful. You do another study, it's even more successful, 80% methane reduction. Plus it doesn't seem to affect the cows' health. It makes them fat, healthy and still delicious. What does that make you want to do? Sort of - I assume this is the researchers' dream - right? - to prove that something works. But how do you go from having the solution to actually implementing the solution? What do you do with this knowledge? KEBREAB: Yeah, that's a very good question. So not too long ago, the California Department of Food and Agriculture has given their approval that it be generally recognized as safe. So a certain formulation can now be sold in California as well. So it's moving in the right direction. The ultimate dream is then to get it into farmer's hands and be able to use it as soon as possible. And what I'm thinking is that, you know, maybe there's a premium product with a low-emission milk or meat as well. So. . . ZOMORODI: So maybe I would go to the grocery store and I'd say, you know what? I'll pay the extra $0. 25 to get. . . KEBREAB: Yeah. ZOMORODI: . . . The reduced-methane milk. KEBREAB: Absolutely, yes. We've done that with energy. I mean, a number of states, they have this initiative where you pay a little bit more and you get a renewable source of energy instead of from fossil fuel. The same thing could apply here as well. ZOMORODI: You know, I have to ask, I'm sure there are people listening - maybe they're vegetarian or, like me, who are trying to eat less meat and maybe thinking like, well, there's a very easy solution to this problem with cows and methane, just don't eat them, don't drink milk, just don't have as many cows, period. What do you think of that response? KEBREAB: Yeah, so I think, in a lot of high-income countries, you may be able to get the nutrients and the micronutrients that people need to lead a healthy life. But most people don't live in high-income countries. And the other issue is that, you know, there is this issue of hidden hunger. ZOMORODI: Wait, what is that? What is hidden hunger? KEBREAB: You have enough calories and maybe even protein, but you don't have the trace minerals that your body needs to have a properly functioning system. So particularly for children, children below 5 years of age, what you see is the stunting levels are very much correlated with the animal source food consumption. In countries that have high consumption of animal source food, the stunting levels are much, much lower. In countries that do not - for example, in Sudan and India and others - the stunting levels of children under 5 years of age is over 40%. So the solution is to have those animals source foods in a way that is enough to be able to lead a normal life. So I think what we can do in the West or in high-income countries is consume animal source food according to our requirement. If you are overconsuming, then yes, you have to reduce the intake. ZOMORODI: OK, so reduce the intake. If we - meaning, like, if we live somewhere where nutritious food is easy to get, we still need to cut back on eating meat. But you're also saying that we need to accept the reality that we need to feed everyone in the world. KEBREAB: That's absolutely right, yes. ZOMORODI: So, Ermias, do you believe that, if we radically rethink the ways we've been doing agriculture for years - in this case, the way we've been feeding livestock - that we've got at least one solution to help stop global warming? KEBREAB: Yeah, absolutely. I think, you know, who would have thought that we are talking about a climate-neutral livestock industry? I mean, that's the kind of goal that we need to have and, you know, use it completely. Instead of saying, stop eating meat, stop doing this, stop doing that, we have to be realistic of what needs to happen. And the reality is that, you know, people are not going to stop eating meat. And so let's figure out a way in which we can help people and help the environment at the same time. Climate change is happening and it's not waiting for anybody. We have the solution. We need to implement it because we will see the results fairly quickly. Methane - in 12 years of time, the reduction that you have now would actually translate into even a cooling of the climate. We will see that result. I believe that we can reach into a climate-neutral situation where what we eat is actually - does not have an impact on the warming of the climate.

That's what I wanted to do and that's what I studied - biology and agriculture. I've had a relationship with cows for quite a long time. (SOUNDBITE OF COW MOOING) ZOMORODI: Now, Ermias is a professor at UC Davis, where he studies cows, specifically a problem with cows - their burps. (SOUNDBITE OF COW BURPING) ZOMORODI: Those burps are full of methane, one of the greenhouse gases that contributes to climate change. In fact, cows account for 4% of U. S. greenhouse gas emissions every year. I always thought that cows were particularly flatulent. Is this true? KEBREAB: It is not. ZOMORODI: Oh. KEBREAB: So most of the gas is formed in their stomach, so in their guts, particularly in the first chamber. And so they belch it out. By some estimates, between 95% to 97% of the methane comes from the front end of the cow. So the back end of the cow is really maybe 3% or less. (SOUNDBITE OF TRUMPET PLAYING) ZOMORODI: So for the past several years, Ermias and his team have been experimenting with how changing a cow's diet could safely and quickly lower the amount of methane in its belches. Here's Ermias Kebreab on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) KEBREAB: So how can you reduce these methane burps? My colleagues and I may have found a solution - seaweed. Let me explain. A couple of years ago, an article was published that showed almost complete elimination of methane when seaweed was added to chopped grass in the lab. Great. But, as an agricultural researcher, I know lots of additives work well in the lab but not in real animals. But there was something different about seaweed and the way in which it reduced methane. Some seaweeds contain ingredients that directly inhibit microbes in the cow's gut from forming methane without interfering with food digestion. So we thought we should test this in live animals. This was the first ever experiment in dairy cattle, and we had no idea how much to give them. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ZOMORODI: OK. So your team starts mixing in just a little bit of seaweed into the cow's regular feed. And what did the cows think? Like, did they like it? KEBREAB: Well, the ones that we gave too much, they did not eat as much as we would like them to do it. . . ZOMORODI: (Laughter) OK. KEBREAB: Because, you know, just like the - cows are very picky eaters. ZOMORODI: Oh, I didn't know that. KEBREAB: Oh, yeah. They sort their feed. They will find the bits and pieces that they like. ZOMORODI: (Laughter) It's like my dog. KEBREAB: (Laughter) Yeah. ZOMORODI: All right. KEBREAB: So they didn't get used to it right away. But - so we gave them for about three weeks, and then we switched them around and then another three weeks and then we switched them around. And that was it. ZOMORODI: And all the while, though, you're collecting their burps? That's not a sentence I thought I would ever say, Ermias. KEBREAB: (Laughter). ZOMORODI: How do you do that? KEBREAB: The way we do it is, we have a device called GreenFeed. (SOUNDBITE OF COWS MOOING) KEBREAB: And what it does is it will entice them to come to this machine where they feed - they stick their head into this machine, and they feed from that machine. So as soon as they come in, the GreenFeed machine will drop some. . . (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) KEBREAB: . . . What we call cow cookie. So they just eat this cow cookie. As they're eating, they will be breathing into this machine, and the machine will take out their breath. And then, right away, analyze in their burping how much methane, how much carbon dioxide, how much hydrogen there is and then automatically sends that information wirelessly. And the cows love it. I mean, you would see them line up to try to get into this machine. ZOMORODI: (Laughter) OK, great. So you have very willing participants in your study. And what was your hypothesis? What did you sort of hope you would see? KEBREAB: What I was hoping was that we see 10%, 20%, 30% at most reduction in emissions. That would make me very, very happy. But then, when we start doing this, and I start getting this report from my graduate student that the reduction was quite high, I couldn't believe it. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) KEBREAB: In that first experiment, the emissions were reduced by up to 67%. (APPLAUSE) KEBREAB: And I thought, at first, the equipment must have malfunctioned. But it was real. But we are left with more questions than answers. Would the microbes in the gut get used to it and start producing methane over time? Would the seaweed be stable over a long period of time in storage? Would the taste be affected and the cows turn up their noses? Or would the seaweed affect the cows' health or milk production? So we teamed up again to conduct another trial. Over a five-month period, we saw the seaweed reduce emissions by over 80%. (APPLAUSE) KEBREAB: Our colleagues in Australia, they saw up to 98% reduction in a similar trial. That kind of reduction is simply staggering. We have also seen an improvement in bulking up of the beef cattle with no adverse health effects. So it's a win for the environment. It's a win for the farmers and consumers. A panel of 112 people got to taste steak made from steers offered seaweed and control, and they did not detect any difference. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) KEBREAB: We also did a nutritional quality of the meat, and we found no difference between animals that were offered seaweed and the control. ZOMORODI: OK. So you do your first study with cows. It's highly successful. You do another study, it's even more successful, 80% methane reduction. Plus it doesn't seem to affect the cows' health. It makes them fat, healthy and still delicious. What does that make you want to do? Sort of - I assume this is the researchers' dream - right? - to prove that something works. But how do you go from having the solution to actually implementing the solution? What do you do with this knowledge? KEBREAB: Yeah, that's a very good question. So not too long ago, the California Department of Food and Agriculture has given their approval that it be generally recognized as safe. So a certain formulation can now be sold in California as well. So it's moving in the right direction. The ultimate dream is then to get it into farmer's hands and be able to use it as soon as possible. And what I'm thinking is that, you know, maybe there's a premium product with a low-emission milk or meat as well. So. . . ZOMORODI: So maybe I would go to the grocery store and I'd say, you know what? I'll pay the extra $0. 25 to get. . . KEBREAB: Yeah. ZOMORODI: . . . The reduced-methane milk. KEBREAB: Absolutely, yes. We've done that with energy. I mean, a number of states, they have this initiative where you pay a little bit more and you get a renewable source of energy instead of from fossil fuel. The same thing could apply here as well. ZOMORODI: You know, I have to ask, I'm sure there are people listening - maybe they're vegetarian or, like me, who are trying to eat less meat and maybe thinking like, well, there's a very easy solution to this problem with cows and methane, just don't eat them, don't drink milk, just don't have as many cows, period. What do you think of that response? KEBREAB: Yeah, so I think, in a lot of high-income countries, you may be able to get the nutrients and the micronutrients that people need to lead a healthy life. But most people don't live in high-income countries. And the other issue is that, you know, there is this issue of hidden hunger. ZOMORODI: Wait, what is that? What is hidden hunger? KEBREAB: You have enough calories and maybe even protein, but you don't have the trace minerals that your body needs to have a properly functioning system. So particularly for children, children below 5 years of age, what you see is the stunting levels are very much correlated with the animal source food consumption. In countries that have high consumption of animal source food, the stunting levels are much, much lower. In countries that do not - for example, in Sudan and India and others - the stunting levels of children under 5 years of age is over 40%. So the solution is to have those animals source foods in a way that is enough to be able to lead a normal life. So I think what we can do in the West or in high-income countries is consume animal source food according to our requirement. If you are overconsuming, then yes, you have to reduce the intake. ZOMORODI: OK, so reduce the intake. If we - meaning, like, if we live somewhere where nutritious food is easy to get, we still need to cut back on eating meat. But you're also saying that we need to accept the reality that we need to feed everyone in the world. KEBREAB: That's absolutely right, yes. ZOMORODI: So, Ermias, do you believe that, if we radically rethink the ways we've been doing agriculture for years - in this case, the way we've been feeding livestock - that we've got at least one solution to help stop global warming? KEBREAB: Yeah, absolutely. I think, you know, who would have thought that we are talking about a climate-neutral livestock industry? I mean, that's the kind of goal that we need to have and, you know, use it completely. Instead of saying, stop eating meat, stop doing this, stop doing that, we have to be realistic of what needs to happen. And the reality is that, you know, people are not going to stop eating meat. And so let's figure out a way in which we can help people and help the environment at the same time. Climate change is happening and it's not waiting for anybody. We have the solution. We need to implement it because we will see the results fairly quickly. Methane - in 12 years of time, the reduction that you have now would actually translate into even a cooling of the climate. We will see that result. I believe that we can reach into a climate-neutral situation where what we eat is actually - does not have an impact on the warming of the climate.

When you hear the term renewable energy, what do you think of? Maybe solar power, wind, big hydroelectric dams? But if you've ever swum in a hot spring or visited a geyser. . . JAMIE BEARD: Oh, for me, I just sat under Mt. Rainier for a week, and that's a volcano. ZOMORODI: . . . Well, then you've seen another source of potential power - geothermal. BEARD: It's a gigantic source of energy that emanates through the Earth. And parts of it actually escape the surface. ZOMORODI: This is Jamie Beard. BEARD: You have rock with pore space in it. You have water inside that pore space in the rock. And then you have a lot of heat close to the surface. And when you have all those conditions together. . . (SOUNDBITE OF WATER RUSHING)BEARD: . . . That is a gigantic resource. ZOMORODI: And in areas that have these resources, the opportunity for cheap, renewable energy is huge. Thirty percent of Iceland's electricity is geothermal; Kenya - 38%. But Jamie says that for most of the world, geothermal power is. . . BEARD: Nothing. Like, it's so small now that it's barely a blip on the radar. ZOMORODI: Which is why she no longer practices environmental law but is instead working to grow the geothermal industry. BEARD: Geothermal is beneath us anywhere and everywhere in the world. And the only difference between Iceland and right here in Boston, where I'm sitting, is the depth that you need to drill to get to the heat, right? In some places, you have to go deeper. It's not right at the surface. But that - it's still there. You know, that's what's really, really exciting about it to me. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)BEARD: The core of the earth is 6,000 degrees Celsius. It's the same temperature as the surface of the sun. But it's not 94 million miles away. It is right here beneath our feet. ZOMORODI: Jamie Beard continues from the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)BEARD: There are teams of innovators that are working on figuring out how to most efficiently and effectively tap this enormous heat source beneath us. But in order to do that, we've got to figure out how to mimic the conditions that occur in places like Iceland that make geothermal easy to tap and extract and harvest. And those conditions are hot rocks, pore space in the rocks and water filling those pores. Those conditions seem simple, but they actually occur naturally in very, very few places in the world. But the past couple of decades, there have been really disruptive and breakthrough technological innovations that enable us to engineer the subsurface to mimic Mother Nature's geothermal. So technological innovations like directional drilling, where no longer we can just drill straight down, but instead we can actually turn and steer drill bits to reach very precise and specific locations in the subsurface miles underground. And we can also fracture rock now, which means that we can create pore space where pore space does not exist naturally. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)BEARD: So if you take these innovations that I just listed and you put them all together, you end up enabling an entirely new breed of scalable geothermal concepts. Geothermal concepts can be done anywhere in the world. ZOMORODI: OK. So let's talk more about how you actually tap this geothermal energy. Let's get a little technical. Can you explain one of them - EGS? BEARD: Sure. So the first type of hot, dry rock system is engineered or enhanced geothermal systems. And in those, you drill a well, and then you fracture the rock. So it's - remember, this is dry. So there's no fluids down there. And it may not be porous enough, so you want to make more pores. And then you send a fluid down that well. And circulating that fluid through the rock, the fluid heats up. It comes - you produce it in a well at the surface, and you run a turbine to produce electricity. So you're actually running a power plant. ZOMORODI: So it's basically the same as geothermal plants in Iceland or Kenya, just, like, much, much deeper under the ground. BEARD: Right. ZOMORODI: OK. But you said that there's another way to get at that energy that you're psyched about. BEARD: Yeah. So the second concept that's really interesting is closed-loop systems. And closed loop is actually - it leans really heavy on the use of directional drilling techniques. And that's essentially the ability to turn your drill bit and to aim for a specific place underground that you want to go. And you don't need to use fractures in closed loops because they're closed, right? And so you have an underground radiator that you circulate a fluid through. And that fluid is produced at the surface and runs a power plant just like in EGS. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)BEARD: These are not moonshots. We are talking about making very incremental changes to existing technologies with an eye on more hotter and deeper geothermal developments. There are teams in the field demonstrating these concepts - teams like Sage Geosystems, a team that I mentor. This is a well in - get this - Texas. This is a Texas pasture where you would never suspect the enormous geothermal resources that lie below. And this well is an existing abandoned oil and gas well that they have repurposed for this geothermal demonstration. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)BEARD: In the past 18 months, more geothermal startups have launched than in the past 10 years combined. If even one of these startups is successful at proving a scalable geothermal concept, we are literally off to the races in developing this massive, reliable 24/7 clean energy source anywhere in the world. ZOMORODI: So if we've got the technology, what's holding us back from a geothermal power boom? Jamie says it's politics. When we come back, her proposal for bringing together the fossil fuel industry and environmentalists. I'm Manoush Zomorodi. And you're listening to the TED Radio Hour from NPR. Stay with us. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ZOMORODI: It's the TED Radio Hour from NPR. I'm Manoush Zomorodi. On today's episode - Repair, Repurpose, Reimagine. And we were just hearing from Jamie Beard, who describes herself as a geothermal instigator. BEARD: The thing I love about geothermal is it's clean and renewable in that it's this naturally occurring energy source that is ubiquitous, near limitless. ZOMORODI: Jamie believes that we are on the cusp of turning geothermal energy into a massive new source of alternative power. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)BEARD: So how do we do that? It brings me to my proposition. ZOMORODI: Here she is again on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)BEARD: To scale geothermal, we need to efficiently, effectively and safely drill below the surface over and over and over and over again. And who does that now? The oil and gas industry does that now. The oil and gas industry is a global, specialized workforce of millions, backed by almost 200 years of breakthrough technological innovation, all aimed at producing energy from deep underground. You flip the switch and you have green drilling, and oil and gas keeps its current business model, the business model that keeps them firmly rooted in hydrocarbons now. They're doing what they know how to do, which is exploring for, drilling for and producing a subsurface energy asset. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ZOMORODI: So, Jamie, you went from being an activist who was against the fossil fuel industry to working with that industry and trying to get it to transition into geothermal. Why? That doesn't sound like a natural progression to make. BEARD: I would have agreed with you when I was 18, 19, early 20s, vehemently. In fact, I started my career working in renewables like solar and wind. One thing that I did realize, though, over the past years is that, you know, if we want to go fast - and there is an enormous amount of climate urgency - we literally have a Ferrari in the driveway. You've got millions of highly skilled workers. You've got a ton of relevant technologies and a hundred years of know-how. You have an existing global footprint with spot-on core competencies in this area. Why not use that? That is a gigantic resource. ZOMORODI: So when you talk to people who are in the oil and gas industry and you propose to them this idea of turning their teams and resources into geothermal power plants, what's their response? BEARD: So one of the first individuals that I contacted was a former chief scientist at Shell named Lance Cook. And he was skeptical at first, and we had a lot of fights. And over a period of months, he came around and decided that he was excited enough about geothermal and the ability to reduce costs using oil and gas technologies and methodologies. Then he went and started a company. But now there are more than 25 teams that I'm working with now, all pursuing different concepts and types of projects in geothermal. ZOMORODI: So I need to ask - fracking for fossil fuels is very divisive. A lot has been reported on the pollution that fracking rock for oil and gas can cause. My understanding is that fracking for geothermal would be far less dangerous. But do you think people are ever really going to believe that? BEARD: If there is something that I lose sleep over, it's that. I mean, this is something that, technologically speaking, I'm not worried. Like, that is going to be solved fast. What I'm worried about here is the human resources problem. And it's a big one, right? (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)BEARD: How do you deal with the fact that we're talking about essentially here green fracking, right? Is green fracking going to be a thing? And will environmental groups and climate activists - of which I'm one, you know - accept? But geothermal is just too awesome to become this, like, political football. It's a cause that, like, every single one of us could get behind. But we need to make sure that we're doing the work in, you know, inclusion of voices, talking to one another, compromising, and that's hard. But why would we go - why would we start from scratch and rebuild industries, you know, or start - you know, start from scratch and build new industries that are going to take us 100 years to power the Earth that we don't have when we've already got one that we can just pivot toward geothermal? ZOMORODI: That's Jamie Beard. She's the founder of the nonprofit Project InnerSpace. You can find her full talk at ted. com.

I'm Manoush Zomorodi. Today on the show - Repair, Repurpose, Reimagine. So, Andrew, where are we going? ANDREW DENT: We're heading to the library. And it is. . . ZOMORODI: The other day I took the subway to Lower Manhattan to go to a library. DENT: It's just through here. And it is. . . ZOMORODI: But this isn't a library for books. Housed on the sixth floor of a skyscraper right near Wall Street is a library for materials. DENT: It's innovative and sustainable stuff - so things which is new, different, materials that perhaps you wouldn't have expected. And we do, of course. . . ZOMORODI: My guide, the librarian, is scientist Andrew Dent. DENT: I work as a material researcher for a company called Material ConneXionZOMORODI: The company acts as a kind of matchmaker. DENT: Yes. Yes. We like to match the innovators, the people who manufacture these materials or create these materials, and the people who use them, it's - whether it's an architect, designer or a manufacturer of product themselves. And we do, of course, have resources for the more standard materials, the stuff that you make shampoo bottles out of or the leather for your couch. But designers kind of want to see what's new and what's next. ZOMORODI: So this is like walking in the future. This is, like, if I. . . The materials library is a large room filled with movable walls, each with dozens of samples of different materials mounted on display from floor to ceiling. OK, I'm following you. We go through the wall after wall after wall of materials. And some of these are just like little boxes. What's this one? This is a method for turning egg shells and tomato peels into automobile tires. Oh, my God. This is 100% vegan leather made of apple peels. That's so cool. I mean, just in front of me here is a sound-absorbing panel made from natural hand-picked Scandinavian reindeer moss. Is it OK if I touch it? DENT: You can, yes. ZOMORODI: That's OK? It's very soft. It's soft. I would love to have a wall made out of that. DENT: Yeah. ZOMORODI: What's the criteria for something to make it into the library? DENT: Yes, we have a panel that judges the materials. You know, we, of course, want to include as much stuff as possible. We want to ensure that our designers have access to as many different options as possible. But for us, we want really just the stuff that will be wow but also the stuff that will offer a more sustainable, lower-carbon future and will resonate with consumers. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)DENT: When you throw something away, it typically goes into a landfill. ZOMORODI: Andrew says we need to reimagine how we make and build things and use materials that will never end up as garbage. Here he is on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)DENT: An industry that's not doing so well is the architecture industry. One of the challenges with architecture has always been, when we build up, we don't think about taking down. That's a challenge because it ends up that about a third of all landfill waste in the U. S. is architecture. We need to think differently about this. There are programs that can actually reduce some of this material. A good example is this - there's actually bricks that are made from old demolition waste, which includes the glass, includes the rubble, includes the concrete. They put up a grinder, put it all together, heat it up and make these bricks we can basically build more buildings from. But it's only a fraction of what we need. My hope is that, with big data and geotagging, we can actually change that and we can be more thrifty when it comes to buildings. If there's a building down the block which is being demolished, are there materials there that the new building being built here can use? Can we use that ability to understand all of the materials that are available in that building that are still usable - can we then basically put them into a new building without actually losing any value in the process? ZOMORODI: OK. So let's say I - let's say I'm one of your clients and I arrived here and I said, you know, Andrew, I have - look at my beautiful design for, I don't know, a sneaker - a new fashionable sneaker, but I definitely want to market it to a conscientious consumer. You would then take me into the library and show me what? DENT: We would show you two types of things. We would show you materials. We'd also show you new manufacturing processes as well. ZOMORODI: Ew, Andrew, that looks like a box with somebody's old chewing gum in it. DENT: Exactly right. So there's a company in London that is taking - well, basically has put containers around the city. So when you finish chewing your gum, rather than leaving it on the floor, which is in itself not a good thing, you can put it into one of these receptacles and they will collect it, they will clean it, and then they will take that material - because it's basically a rubbery material - and they'll synthesize it and manufacture it into products. ZOMORODI: Like what? DENT: Coffee cup lids, coffee cups themselves, even the soles of shoes. Because the material - it's just a chemistry. So, yes, it's been inside my mouth and I've been chewing it. It's got bacteria from my mouth. But once we clean that off, the raw material itself has value as basically a rubbery, durable and colorable product. ZOMORODI: So is this a proof of concept or is this actually. . . OK. So what's this? DENT: So this is a - it's a rigid panel material, perhaps used as a countertop, 100% from fish scales. ZOMORODI: No way, fish scales? DENT: Yeah. ZOMORODI: So, OK, tell me where this - OK, explain the process here. It looks - by the way, it really looks just like a - maybe quartz, quartz countertops. DENT: Yeah, a quartz countertop, yes, or something like that. So, yes, turns out that chitosan, which is what fish scales are made out of, is a very wonderful engineering material. So they're going clean it first so it doesn't smell of fish. Like, if you smell it. . . ZOMORODI: It doesn't smell like anything. DENT: OK. Exactly. You know, because we're now able to clean these sorts of things very effectively. So it doesn't smell of fish, there's no salt in it. So we just take the raw material, clean it well, press it together hard with a binder, and it becomes a viable, valuable material. ZOMORODI: Is this going to happen soon. Are there - I don't know - fish canneries in Alaska also turning into kitchen countertop companies? DENT: This company sells kitchen countertops. You can purchase kitchen countertop from this company which is 100% fish scales. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ZOMORODI: Do I get a discount? DENT: (Laughter). UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Sorry, just keep going. DENT: OK. This one I thought might be interesting - merdacotta. It's actually some rough-looking cups and bowls that are manufactured out of cow manure. ZOMORODI: Really? OK, so it looks like a terra cotta mug. Oh, you're taking it off. DENT: Yes. ZOMORODI: Can I touch it again? DENT: Yes, of course. ZOMORODI: OK. DENT: You can drink out of it as well. It was more of a concept. ZOMORODI: OK. DENT: But the. . . ZOMORODI: But this is poop. This is cow poop. DENT: This is cow poop. Yes. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ZOMORODI: But it looks really nice. DENT: (Laughter) Well, it's also very functional. The thing was, you had a farmer, a dairy farmer, who basically was worried about the amount of manure they were producing. They had to discard it somehow, and there wasn't any other use for it. So they were like, OK, well, since it's mostly just cellulose fibers, it's really - it's still usable material. So they decided that, OK, well, let's fashion it into cups and then just fire it and manufacture these products out of it. ZOMORODI: But I'm guessing that's a hard sell, right? I mean, right? DENT: Well, it doesn't need to be a cup. It can be floor tiles. It can be anything. It can be something else that, perhaps, you wouldn't be drinking out of. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ZOMORODI: I have to ask you, as a consumer, I mean, it's really depressing. Everything I read basically says, that's very nice that you're recycling your milk jug or your laundry detergent jug, but the chances of it actually being recycled and reused again is pretty limited. Would - do you feel that way, too? Is that true? I feel like we don't even know what to believe anymore when it comes to recycling as consumers. DENT: It is confusing, yes. And our recycling rates are abysmal. If we take the most easily recyclable and the most valuable material, say a water bottle or a soda bottle - so that material is amorphous polyester, OK? It's clear. It recycles very easily. We've got a very efficient system to recycle it. It ends up as chairs or as clothing. So it's got a second life. It has value. And we still only recycle about a quarter of it. Compare that to other plastics, let's say the polyethylene used in milk cartons or in shampoo bottles, that number gets down to sort of 5- or 10%. But it is possible to do it efficiently. There are some Scandinavian countries - yes, I know, they always do it better than we do - where their recycling rates are up in the 80s- and 90 percents. So almost everything that they are using then gets recycled back into something else. We have a unique challenge here in the U. S. , but it is possible to improve. And yes, it can be sometimes that you lose faith in it, but there have been so many new methods of recycling. And our efficiencies of actually repurposing that material once it does actually get recycled are so good, I believe that there is still hope. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)DENT: So have you think about the way - if you make anything, if you're any part of a design firm, if you basically are refurbishing your house - any aspect in which - where you make something, think about how that product could potentially be used as a second life or third life or fourth life. Design in that the ability for it to be taken apart. ZOMORODI: In the meantime, it sounds like we also need to consider changing the way we manufacture things so that they are - is it - is the right term circular? Is that the right term? DENT: Yes. That is the ideal, that everything should work in circles. Because everything in nature works in circles. The water circle, the circle of life - nature basically finds a second life, a third life, a repeatable life for everything it has. There is no waste in nature. And we are thinking about designing products so they have the potential for a second life. So trying to remove glues, which make it very hard to pull things apart. Trying to make things which are what we call monomaterial, so all from the same material, so therefore you can put it in the same recycling bin. So this design evolution has tried to approach design as a way of ensuring that any product can have a second or third life. ZOMORODI: I just want to ask you, what comes to your mind as a material scientist when I say - I mean, it's a phrase that's been said an infinite number of times - reuse, repurpose, recycle. Is that still the right message or is there a new message that we need? DENT: It's still a viable message. I think reuse, to me, is possibly one of the most valuable ones because no matter how sustainable you can make a product, if it can last two or three times the length of another product, then that is always going to be the better choice. But I think that the standard three of reduce, reuse, recycle are iterative. They are steps we can take for existing solutions. I think for me, it's very much about reimagine. I know it's a tired, old example, but from CDs to iTunes - we've just reimagined and now it's a process that uses no material at all. So I think a lot of examples which are the most successful is where a designer or an architect or a brand owner has completely reimagined the product or its use and therefore has gone away with any concern about the three original Rs. So reimagine, I think, would probably be the best new solution, if we can. ZOMORODI: That's Andrew Dent. He's the executive vice president of materials research at Material ConneXion.

It's been more than three months since Putin invaded Ukraine, but the digital destruction that experts promised seems to be missing - or is it? Software giants like Microsoft might have the answer. NPR's cybersecurity correspondent Jenna McLaughlin went to Seattle to find out. JENNA MCLAUGHLIN, BYLINE: Tom Burt says there's absolutely a cyberwar going on in Ukraine right now. TOM BURT: If you are Ukrainian, this has been a relentless, unending cyberwar that has been launched in correspondence with the physical war, in what is clearly the world's first major hybrid war. MCLAUGHLIN: I spoke to Burt inside Microsoft's Digital Crimes Unit, part of a sprawling tech metropolis surrounded by woods and mountains just east of downtown Seattle. On the wall, he had a massive map of Ukraine to show us where the cyberattacks are happening. BURT: So we're just looking at a map of Ukraine, and. . . MCLAUGHLIN: Burt leads a team of analysts who work with the sleuths in the Digital Crimes Unit. In a quiet room humming with servers, he tells us about a fresh wave of attacks that they haven't spoken about publicly before. BURT: We've seen a number of cyberattacks going, targeting specifically railways. And at the same time, there have been bombing attacks on railways. MCLAUGHLIN: As the war drags on, Russia's targeting transportation so Ukrainians can't move vital supplies. But this is just the latest of a series of attacks that date back to even months before the Russian invasion. BURT: So in February, as the forces were marshaling on the border of Ukraine, we had seen a number of cyber events already. In January, we saw destructive attacks against a number of Ukrainian government agencies. MCLAUGHLIN: In a cyberwar, it's often private companies that have the most insight into what's happening - even more than the U. S. government. Microsoft isn't the only game in town, but pretty much everybody has at least one Microsoft product running on their phone or computer. BURT: We receive, every day, 24 trillion signals that come in from our environment. MCLAUGHLIN: The night of February 24, the world watched in horror as Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a special military operation in a prerecorded address. For most, that marked the beginning of a full-scale invasion. BURT: Well, from our viewpoint, it really started February 23. About 10 hours before the missiles were launched and the tanks rolled across the border, there was a huge wiper attack across 300 different systems in government agencies and private-sector companies in Ukraine. MCLAUGHLIN: A wiper attack is designed to literally wipe away all the data. While Burt says his team can't be sure Russian hackers are coordinating their attacks directly with the soldiers and the tanks, there has been a lot of overlap between physical and cyberattacks. BURT: So you might see, for example, espionage attacks into government agencies in a particular town just before that town is hit by missiles. MCLAUGHLIN: The goal is to damage important public institutions and their ability to function. That includes the media, too. BURT: And so they bombed, you know, radio towers. They physically invaded and seized media companies. And at the same time, they were engaged in cyberattacks on media companies. MCLAUGHLIN: The attacks have been relentless, but it's not all bad news. BURT: They've been attacked by the Russians for so many years, and the work that they've done to be resilient has really paid off. It's enabled them to be fast, be able to defend well and to be able to recover when they are attacked. MCLAUGHLIN: Burt's team is facing challenges they've never seen before. One instance in particular jumps to mind - when his team was trying to alert one Ukrainian company about a cyberattack. BURT: And we got a response back that was, yes, but we can't do anything with it right now. There's tanks outside the gates. MCLAUGHLIN: Tom Burt is aware that, sitting here in Seattle, he is far away from the front lines, even as his team works constantly to battle Russian cyberattacks. BURT: We're back here in the United States, where we're safe. Our families are not at risk. We are not personally at risk. But the Ukrainians are. There are tanks, and there's missiles, and there's guns. MCLAUGHLIN: They're doing everything they can to help, says Burt, but they're not the ones in the trenches.

NPR's Jennifer Vanasco reports on a new app that aims to take visitors around Manhattan's Chinatown through voices and oral histories.

Using geolocation, listeners can follow the included map and wander around. And as they move, the soundscape changes. Composer George Tsz-Kwan Lam created the app, and he walked me around the neighborhood to show me how it works. GEORGE TSZ-KWAN LAM: I am thinking that if I embed these stories within music and also within a place, you start connecting with, oh, well, I've walked by this building so many times, going to work, going to a restaurant, and now I can associate with this voice that's talking about how this person came here or who their grandfather was. VANASCO: For the oral histories, Lam interviewed five Chinese Americans who grew up around the country, and he set their stories to music. LAM: I think one of the challenges of oral history is that, sometimes, they just get locked up in the archive. I think partly it's because it's hard to relate to some of these stories, right? They can be very personal. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: His distant aunt worked in a garment factory, but he didn't know which ones. So he went knocking to each - knocking on the door for every garment factory that he could. VANASCO: Central to the map are five Chinese family associations. They're civic associations that since the 1800s have connected new immigrants with those already here. The audio soundscape centers around them, just like the associations are a center for immigrants and their children to connect with each other. If you're near the Wong family association, you'll hear this.

Long Ridge CEO Bo Wholey says his company recently started blending a small amount of hydrogen - no more than 5% - to power the generators. BO WHOLEY: The market really shifted over the last couple of years in the conversation about clean energy. And we're really responding to what the market wants. FRAZIER: Eventually, Wholey wants to run the plant completely on hydrogen. That goal may be more attainable thanks to a big infrastructure law passed last year. It includes $8 billion for at least four hydrogen hubs to produce, store and use this combustible gas. Backers hope to land one of these hubs in this part of the Ohio River Valley.

FRAZIER: Paulina Jaramillo of Carnegie Mellon University says hydrogen can be a clean alternative for things like steel mills, fertilizer plants or shipping. Hydrogen can be made in a number of ways, each with its own color-coding system. There's gray hydrogen, how most hydrogen is made today - through heating up natural gas. This creates lots of carbon dioxide, the driving force in climate change. Blue hydrogen is when that CO2 is captured. The infrastructure bill mandates one blue hydrogen hub and another for green hydrogen. That's where renewable energy is used to extract hydrogen from water, so it gives off no carbon dioxide. Blue hydrogen still produces some CO2. And it relies on the natural gas system, which leaks methane, a highly potent greenhouse gas. That's why Julie McNamara with the Union of Concerned Scientists wants better methane safeguards on any federal funding for blue hydrogen. JULIE MCNAMARA: The government is now investing $8 billion to catalyze an industry that might not be clean at all if they don't get this right.

FRAZIER: In his lab at the University of Pittsburgh, chemical engineer Gotz Veser shows off an experiment one of his grad students is running. Inside a glass case, tubes run natural gas through a chamber that produces hydrogen. And instead of CO2, the byproduct is solid carbon - easier to dispose of, no carbon capture necessary. VESER: If you really want to remove that carbon, you can literally just dump it anywhere. FRAZIER: Veser says one advantage of blue hydrogen is it relies on technology that's been around for decades. And the politically powerful fossil fuel industry supports it, says Bridget van Dorsten, an analyst with the firm Wood Mackenzie. She says that makes it more likely than a full push for green hydrogen. She asked rhetorically, would the oil and gas industry simply go along with green hydrogen and abandon its own infrastructure? BRIDGET VAN DORSTEN: Or do you think that they would prefer, hey, you know what? That investment that you made in all of that infrastructure, you can keep it. You just got to pay more to, like, add carbon capture onto it - because I think they'd be interested in the latter. FRAZIER: One key blue hydrogen supporter is Senator Joe Manchin. Manchin blocked Biden's climate agenda last year, but said he might accept a compromise bill with clean energy tax credits, including one for hydrogen.

But what does outer space sound like? Maybe this. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)SIMON: That's what NASA calls a sonification - not the literal sounds from the cosmos, but a translation to help blind and low-vision people appreciate the majesty of space. It's a project that Dr. Kim Arcand has been working on at NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory. She joins us now. Dr. Arcand, thanks so much for being with us. KIM ARCAND: Hi. Thanks so much for having me. SIMON: That was a clip that purports to sound like the Milky Way Galaxy, right? ARCAND: Right. Exactly. That is, like, the inner 400 light-years around our Milky Way's sort of downtown area. So what we're doing is we're actually taking light and translating it into sound as a way to make our data a little bit more approachable. SIMON: How does that work? ARCAND: So we actually take the data, and we extrapolate the information that we need. We really pay attention to the scientific story to make sure that conversion from light into sound is something that will make sense for people, particularly for people who are blind or low vision. SIMON: So they would hear the differences between different galaxies. ARCAND: Right, exactly. So our Milky Way galaxy - that inner region that we just heard - that is this really sort of energetic area where there's just a whole lot of frenetic activity taking place. But if we're looking at a different galaxy that perhaps is a little bit more calm, a little bit more restive at its core, it could sound completely different. SIMON: You're a visual scientist, I gather. What moved you to accomplish this in sounds? ARCAND: Actually, I think I started out the first, like, say, 10 years of my career really paying attention to only the visual and just realized that I had done a complete disservice to people who were either not visual learners or for people who are blind or low vision. And so during the pandemic, particularly, I reached out to some colleagues who specialize in this sort of area of data sonification, Matt Russo and Andrew Santaguida, to be able to work with them to take data from NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory and the Hubble Space Telescope and translate it into a way that could be heard in a really exciting new form. SIMON: Well, I can't wait to hear another example. This is, I'm told, \"Pillars Of Creation. \"(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)SIMON: Oh, my gosh. ARCAND: (Laughter). SIMON: That really reaches inside, doesn't it? ARCAND: I hope so. I think those soundscapes that are being created can really bring a bit of emotion to data that could seem pretty esoteric and abstract otherwise. In what we just heard, we're listening now to, like, a baby stellar nursery, so these tall columns of gas and dust where stars are forming. And you're listening to the interplay between the X-ray information and the optical information. And it's really trying to give you a bit of the text. SIMON: Wow. Now, I'm told that earlier this month, you and your team developed not just a sonic representation of an image, but - get ready for this, everyone - the actual sound of a black hole. (SOUNDBITE OF BLACK HOLE)SIMON: Please, Dr. Arcand, forgive me for this. I'm dazzled. But am I just going to hear this in a \"Star Wars\" film? ARCAND: (Laughter) So for some reason, most of the people who have heard this have responded it either sounds like a horror movie soundtrack or something from a Hans Zimmer score. But yeah, what we're listening to is essentially a re-sonification, so a data sonification of an actual sound wave in this cluster of galaxies where there is this supermassive black hole at the core that's sort of burping and sending out all of these waves, if you will. And the scientists who originally studied the data were able to find out what the note is. And it was essentially a B-flat, about 57 octaves below middle C. So we've taken that sound that the universe was singing and then just brought it back up into the range of human hearing because we certainly can't hear 57 octaves below middle C. SIMON: Oh, my word. Does our Earth send out a sound? And I hope it's not by B. J. Leiderman, who does our theme music. But please go ahead. ARCAND: There are sounds for sure that we are making as humans on Earth. However, what's interesting about sonifications like this of Perseus that are far, far away is that there is actually a medium for those sound waves to travel through, whereas here in the solar system, we don't have that medium. So in this cluster of galaxies, there's this hot gas, and that pressure wave is moving through them. And that's how the sound waves are being formed. SIMON: I'm just stupefied, I've got to tell you. ARCAND: That's great, I guess (laughter). SIMON: Dr. Kim Arcand is a visualization scientist at NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory and the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. And by the way, you can find some of these sonifications at our website, npr. org. Thank you so much, and keep listening to the stars. ARCAND: Thanks so much. SCOTT SIMON, HOST:   NASA has been capturing awesome - and for once the word is justified - images from outer space for more than 60 years, the blue marble of Earth, the auroras of Jupiter, the Andromeda Galaxy, millions of light-years away. But what does outer space sound like? Maybe this. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SIMON: That's what NASA calls a sonification - not the literal sounds from the cosmos, but a translation to help blind and low-vision people appreciate the majesty of space. It's a project that Dr. Kim Arcand has been working on at NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory. She joins us now. Dr. Arcand, thanks so much for being with us. KIM ARCAND: Hi. Thanks so much for having me. SIMON: That was a clip that purports to sound like the Milky Way Galaxy, right? ARCAND: Right. Exactly. That is, like, the inner 400 light-years around our Milky Way's sort of downtown area. So what we're doing is we're actually taking light and translating it into sound as a way to make our data a little bit more approachable. SIMON: How does that work? ARCAND: So we actually take the data, and we extrapolate the information that we need. We really pay attention to the scientific story to make sure that conversion from light into sound is something that will make sense for people, particularly for people who are blind or low vision. SIMON: So they would hear the differences between different galaxies. ARCAND: Right, exactly. So our Milky Way galaxy - that inner region that we just heard - that is this really sort of energetic area where there's just a whole lot of frenetic activity taking place. But if we're looking at a different galaxy that perhaps is a little bit more calm, a little bit more restive at its core, it could sound completely different. SIMON: You're a visual scientist, I gather. What moved you to accomplish this in sounds? ARCAND: Actually, I think I started out the first, like, say, 10 years of my career really paying attention to only the visual and just realized that I had done a complete disservice to people who were either not visual learners or for people who are blind or low vision. And so during the pandemic, particularly, I reached out to some colleagues who specialize in this sort of area of data sonification, Matt Russo and Andrew Santaguida, to be able to work with them to take data from NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory and the Hubble Space Telescope and translate it into a way that could be heard in a really exciting new form. SIMON: Well, I can't wait to hear another example. This is, I'm told, \"Pillars Of Creation. \" (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SIMON: Oh, my gosh. ARCAND: (Laughter). SIMON: That really reaches inside, doesn't it? ARCAND: I hope so. I think those soundscapes that are being created can really bring a bit of emotion to data that could seem pretty esoteric and abstract otherwise. In what we just heard, we're listening now to, like, a baby stellar nursery, so these tall columns of gas and dust where stars are forming. And you're listening to the interplay between the X-ray information and the optical information. And it's really trying to give you a bit of the text. SIMON: Wow. Now, I'm told that earlier this month, you and your team developed not just a sonic representation of an image, but - get ready for this, everyone - the actual sound of a black hole. (SOUNDBITE OF BLACK HOLE) SIMON: Please, Dr. Arcand, forgive me for this. I'm dazzled. But am I just going to hear this in a \"Star Wars\" film? ARCAND: (Laughter) So for some reason, most of the people who have heard this have responded it either sounds like a horror movie soundtrack or something from a Hans Zimmer score. But yeah, what we're listening to is essentially a re-sonification, so a data sonification of an actual sound wave in this cluster of galaxies where there is this supermassive black hole at the core that's sort of burping and sending out all of these waves, if you will. And the scientists who originally studied the data were able to find out what the note is. And it was essentially a B-flat, about 57 octaves below middle C. So we've taken that sound that the universe was singing and then just brought it back up into the range of human hearing because we certainly can't hear 57 octaves below middle C. SIMON: Oh, my word.

And we should just note real quick that Meta pays NPR to license NPR content. All right. NPR's Bobby Allyn joins us now with more. Hey, Bobby. BOBBY ALLYN, BYLINE: Hey, Ailsa. CHANG: All right. So tell us more - Sheryl Sandberg stepping down after - what? - a really long time at this company, yeah? ALLYN: Yeah. It was - really was a surprise announcement. She said today - appropriately enough, in a Facebook post - that she is leaving the company after a 14-year run. It becomes official this fall. Now, like you were saying, I mean, she has been extremely influential to this company, and she's going to stick around a little bit. She'll be on the company's board, which suggests she's leaving on good terms. And to underscore that, a Facebook spokeswoman told me that she is not being fired or pushed out. CHANG: You used the phrase extremely influential. I mean, how important would you say she was to the rise of Facebook? ALLYN: Oh, hugely. I mean, remember - Facebook was started as this little website by Mark Zuckerberg in a Harvard dorm. It, back then, was, you know, this free-to-use social networking site. And as it became increasingly popular, Zuckerberg, then just in his early 20s, hired Sheryl Sandberg. She was an experienced advertising executive at Google, and she came on board as sort of the adult in the room, right? She handled big-picture issues like advertising, strategy and company culture. Hiring and firing decisions fell to Sheryl Sandberg - as Zuckerberg once put it, all the things I don't want to do, right? CHANG: (Laughter) Lucky him. ALLYN: Yeah, exactly. Sandberg - she really just had a central role in making Facebook one of the biggest advertising companies in the world. CHANG: Well, people may recall that Sandberg coined the phrase lean in. I have a copy of her book. Bobby, can you just remind us what a sensation that book initially caused? ALLYN: Yeah, it really was. In 2013, when it came out, \"Lean In\" was a bestseller. It, you know, pushed for women to be more assertive in the workplace. Sandberg herself described it in lofty terms, saying it was a feminist manifesto. And it did set off a national debate about gender equality in the workplace. Since then, it has been criticized, and it's found a fair share of detractors. Folks said it didn't really live up to some of the ethos of the #MeToo movement. But she used this book as a way to, like, vault a career as a celebrity of sorts. She had, you know, a lot of fans after this book, and she was able to use that popularity to deliver speeches around the world. She was, you know, schmoozing with policymakers who were weighing regulations that would affect Facebook. And, you know, Facebook knew, and they gave her a role that let her lean in, I guess, to her skills as being a, you know, persuasive and powerful spokesperson for the company. CHANG: Yet all of her business success - I mean, it did come with a fair amount of scrutiny, right? Can you talk a little bit about that piece of this? ALLYN: Yeah. Now, it does seem eons ago now, but the Cambridge Analytica scandal - you remember that? - you know, over the millions of Facebook users' data that was used to target voters during the 2016 presidential campaign - inside the company, she took a lot of blame for how that crisis unfolded. And over the years, she's been in the spotlight over various other scandals that have engulfed the company. Most recently, she found herself in hot water after the Wall Street Journal reported that she lobbied a British newspaper to have an unflattering story killed about her ex-boyfriend, Bobby Kotick, the longtime executive of video gaming company Activision Blizzard. Facebook has launched an investigation into whether Sandberg misused company resources in that episode. And Facebook says now the whole thing is unrelated to Sandberg's departure.

It's called BeReal. And as the name suggests, it's trying to create a more authentic social media experience - no filters, no editing. NPR tech reporter Bobby Allyn looks at how BeReal is trying to reinvent the way young people connect with friends. BOBBY ALLYN, BYLINE: Marissa Omaque is a 18-year-old in the San Francisco Bay Area who has had it with Instagram. MARISSA OMAQUE: For the longest time, I would always compare myself to, like, these influencers. Like, oh, how come, like, I can't be like that, you know? Like, I want to be like that, but I'll never, like, get on the same tier as them. It really does get to, like, a lot of people's brains. ALLYN: So when Omaque heard about the French app BeReal, she was eager to try it out. Here's how it works. You only post once a day when prompted. You have just two minutes to take a photo. The app snaps a selfie and whatever's in front of you at once, all without filters and unedited. OMAQUE: When I'm on BeReal, like, I'm not really expecting like, oh, I'm in Hawaii; I'm with my hot boyfriend. Like, I'm just kind of expecting, like, someone on their couch. ALLYN: And that's often what it is, the mundane motions of life - people walking their dog, people staring at a computer, people eating lunch. Omaque's best friend, Khia Reddy, chimes in to say that so much of apps like Instagram and Snapchat feels like a performance, people bragging about vacations or cool parties or who they're hanging out with. On BeReal, there's less fear of missing out - a FOMO-free zone. KHIA REDDY: We're not performing anymore. Most of the time, like, most of my BeReals are either me sitting at my desk doing homework or me at work. ALLYN: That's refreshing to researchers who study social media's impact on child development. UCLA's Yalda Uhls says apps like Instagram and TikTok, where influencer culture thrives, can harm teens' mental health, with teens constantly comparing themselves to the bodies and styles of professional models. YALDA UHLS: Social comparison is normal. Like, it's something that every teenager and every person needs to learn to know how to act in the world. But on social media, you know, it's social comparison on steroids. ALLYN: Uhls says there are obviously plenty of ways to not be real on BeReal. It's social media, after all. But she says an app that pushes people to share photos of what they're really doing and what they really look like is a welcome development. UHLS: I applaud anything that helps young people understand that a filtered approach to life is not a authentic and healthy approach to life. ALLYN: Right now if you go to someone's BeReal profile, you can't see who they follow or how many followers they have. The profiles are totally blank - social media without a popularity contest. The app also doesn't have advertising. Back in the Bay Area, Reddy wonders how BeReal can stay this way forever since eventually the app is going to have to figure out a way to make money. How will the app do that while also staying an intimate, chill place to share photos with friends? REDDY: If there's, like, a feature where, like, celebrities start getting on the app and they're like, oh, you can pay to see the celebrities' BeReal, I'm going to kind of, like, back away, I think, a little bit. ALLYN: BeReal is trying to be a social media app to give everyone a break from social media apps. Silicon Valley sees it as maybe the next big thing. Already, the same venture capitalists who backed Instagram and Twitter are funding BeReal. Of course, there's another way to take a break from social media - try logging off. Bobby Allyn, NPR News.

I'm Manoush Zomorodi. On the show today, Humor Us. VINITH MISRA: I have some jokes. I can't, you know, promise that they'll be funny. But they are jokes. I think you'll agree that they are jokes. ZOMORODI: This is Vinith Misra. MISRA: These are - the way I describe it is if you can imagine a late night host cracking these. That's the aesthetic. ZOMORODI: Vinith is a computer scientist. But I called him to hear some jokes. All right, hit me. MISRA: A new report says that Americans are living longer. That's the good news. The bad news is that a lot of them are living in New Jersey. ZOMORODI: (Laughter) All right. I grew up in New Jersey, but I can take it. MISRA: (Laughter) Jersey is a bit of a punching bag. But speaking of punching bags, a Florida man says he found a rattlesnake in a bag of frozen broccoli. That's terrible. ZOMORODI: OK. MISRA: You should have bought fresh. ZOMORODI: (Laughter) OK. I'm laughing because it's true. Frozen broccoli is gross. It's just mushy. Now, it's debatable whether these jokes are funny - maybe, like, so bad, they're funny. They're definitely weird. MISRA: I'll give you one more. I enjoy this one. A woman in Australia who found a spider in her bananas took it to a reptile park, where it laid over 1,000 eggs. The woman said she was surprised to find so many eggs. But then she remembered she'd bought them at Costco. ZOMORODI: Oh, yeah. That's good. That's good. That one's for my mother-in-law, I think. What makes these jokes so interesting is that Vinith did not write them. A friend did not write them. They were not discovered in some bargain bin joke book. In fact, no one wrote them. MISRA: Yeah. So these jokes were actually generated by a machine. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)MISRA: There is a model called GPT-3, which is made accessible via an organization called OpenAI. And it's actually not a joke model, per se. It's a more general language model. And it serves a lot of different purposes. But it turns out it's also quite good at figuring out the aesthetic and shape of jokes. ZOMORODI: Vinith has long been fascinated by artificial intelligence. He's worked on AI at IBM, Netflix and now Roblox. And he says a big hurdle with artificial intelligence is just getting people to interact with their machines and A. I. more seamlessly. Computational humor could help bridge that gap. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)MISRA: That's right. I'm talking about computational humor. That's using computers to generate and understand humor. ZOMORODI: Here's Vinith Misra on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)MISRA: It's an actual field, no joke. (LAUGHTER)MISRA: Sorry. So computers today, see, they're getting smarter. They're getting smarter. But they're also developing a sense of humor. And they have the potential to change how we relate to our mechanical friends, but also how we relate to each other. And to be clear, I don't think this is just a curiosity. As computers increasingly surround us in our lives, I think it's going to be a necessity. Now, I wasn't always convinced of the value of relatable machines, let alone making you laugh with software. Why would I need my software to lighten the mood, right? But then I took a closer look at myself. See, I'm not an angry man. But I routinely fantasize about taking my laptop and smashing it against a rock. Now, people - people frustrate me, too. But the difference is that with people, I have a safety valve called humor. Even on a call with Comcast, someone cracks a joke, it changes the whole dynamic. We can look at humor as sort of the WD-40 of human interactions. In a world where we're increasingly surrounded by computers, we're going to desperately need some of that lubrication, or we're going to drown in the frustration. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ZOMORODI: Vinith's appreciation of the power of humor goes way back to his childhood, when he realized how quickly jokes could help him make friends. MISRA: We were moving around a lot. And I didn't really have a very static set of friends. I was born in India. I moved to Pennsylvania, then Alabama, then California. And, you know, I wasn't necessarily the most gregarious person to begin with. And it wasn't the easiest thing. But I did realize, you know, like, cracking jokes could be a way to make those connections. And what I resorted to was, in hindsight, basically, creating these sort of algorithms for jokes. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)MISRA: So I'd start with a joke like this one. What do you call a bee that eats too much? Chubby. OK. I was in elementary school, cut me some slack. Now, I'd recognized, not being a total moron, that the humor in this joke comes from the similarity of chubby and bee. And then I'd replicate this tons of times. What do you call a bee that's good for your health? A Vitamin B. What do you call a newborn bee? A baby. What do you call a bee in the spring? A maybe. You get the idea. Now. . . (LAUGHTER)MISRA: . . . What's interesting, though, is that this process that I described for you, this very hack-ish and uncreative process, it may not sound like an algorithm, but it is. ZOMORODI: And now, as an adult, as a technologist, you look back and you see sort of very rudimentary coding that was happening in your mind, right? MISRA: Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. I mean, that stuff was essentially algorithms, right? It's a very simplistic algorithm. So if you had to replicate what I was doing with a computer - and this is, actually, kind of, like, old school natural language processing or computational humor. So in this case, you craft a sentence that's structured in a very particular way, that needs certain words or phrases that fit certain parts of speech and rules within that sentence. And you look up, basically, lists of words that kind of fit that profile. And you kind of swap them in. It's just a very deterministic, honestly, kind of a dumb process. Most of the thinking is happening when you're creating that structure in the first place. That's where that - that's where to put on your thinking hat. ZOMORODI: It kind of reminds me of Mad Libs, you know, just swapping in nouns and verbs to make funny, surprising sentences. MISRA: Yeah, no, absolutely. I think Mad Libs is a wonderful connection to, you know, these sort of algorithms. And Mad Libs are actually - they are an algorithm. They just have a prompt where humans need to enter some of the data in there. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)MISRA: But to use this more generally and broadly, we're going to have to go beyond puns to the more unstructured and subtle humor that we humans engage in pretty regularly. I mean, think about the last thing that made you laugh. Chances are not only was it not a pun, it probably wasn't even a joke. In some sense, the real goal for us here, it's not necessarily to create machines that are going to write jokes for us but to create machines with personalities that we find humorous or amusing. Now, to get to personalities, though, we often have to go through language. And language is a bare. Your average English speaker knows tens of thousands of words and breaks grammatical rules about as often as he follows them. And even if you can get past that, there's issues of ambiguity, context and general commonsense knowledge. When I ask you, how much does President Obama make, somehow you know I'm asking about his salary, not about how much soup he makes. This is very hard to encode into an algorithm. But in recent days, we may have caught a break. We may have found a back door. And this back door has a big sign on it - that's a hint - and the sign reads data. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)MISRA: Most behaviors, most phenomenon in the world are just so complicated, it's actually pretty hard to capture all of them with a set of rules. And that's where machine learning kind of came in as an alternative to all of this, where instead of trying to write a lot of these rules yourself, you actually let the machines kind of do that for you. You give a bunch of data to them. That's just sort of evidence and observations about whether it's human behavior, human language, what have you, maybe examples of jokes. And you sort of allow the machines to figure out those rules on their own. ZOMORODI: And how good are they at this point? Because, you know, of course, we have facial recognition and. . . MISRA: Absolutely, yeah. ZOMORODI: . . . Photo recognition that's gotten really good. Like, it knows if it's a tiger, that's for sure. MISRA: (Laughter) Right. ZOMORODI: It now knows if it's you. But where are we in terms of - language is a very different beast for. . . MISRA: Absolutely, yeah. ZOMORODI: . . . Machines to understand and parse, right? And I feel like a lot of the time I hear that as we talk about machine learning, we don't necessarily know what the machine has taught itself to look for, right? MISRA: Yeah. Yeah. There is a little bit of this black box phenomenon where you're sort of throwing a bunch of data at it and it's sort of figuring it out, but it's actually kind of mysterious what it's doing inside there. You know, most of the computers you interact with today when they say something to you or they print some language to you, something for you to read, more often than not, that is - almost always that is not generated by a computer. That's usually written by a human being and it's being kind of canned and delivered to you, right? And the reason is that the generation just isn't quite reliable and good enough. So even those examples of jokes I gave earlier, those are cherry-picked, right? Like, those are probably, like, the top 10% of outputs from the model. I can give you the more typical outputs. ZOMORODI: Yeah, let's hear it. MISRA: Yeah. So here's one. A man in Florida was arrested after he tried to pay for his McDonald's order with cocaine. The police said they knew something was up when he tried to get change for a Happy Meal. So it's kind of, like, surreally funny. And it has the shape of a joke, right? It's got, like, Florida. It's got, you know, McDonald's, cocaine. These are all things you would expect to be funny. ZOMORODI: (Laughter) It has Florida. MISRA: That's a really strong indicator, honestly. But it's - but at the end of the day, it's not really a cohesive joke. It doesn't really make a lot of sense. ZOMORODI: No, it's kind of trippy. I mean, the key here is that machines need vast amounts of data, right? Like, so where does this data come from? MISRA: Yeah. No, it's a great question. And yeah, there's this tenet in machine learning called garbage in, garbage out, right? Like, if you put in garbage data, your machine is going to basically be producing garbage for you, too. But it's also biases. And, you know, like, the type of data you're training on will inform your outputs in ways that you might not even realize. It's really, like, holding up a mirror to ourselves and in some cases not the prettiest part of ourselves. ZOMORODI: You're reminding me of that infamous incident a few years ago when Microsoft had a Twitter bot and - racist Twitter bot. Do you remember that? MISRA: Yeah. Yeah, that was bad. ZOMORODI: Can you explain what happened there? MISRA: So what Microsoft created was a - basically a chat bot on I believe it was Twitter. And the interesting thing about this bot was not only was it trained on historical language, but it was also being trained on the conversations it was continuing to have with people. That is basically people could basically continue to influence how this bot behaved by engaging with it on Twitter. So you can imagine where the story goes. It wasn't very long before they had turned this seemingly, you know, innocent social experiment into, you know, this horrifying, like, Nazi-like Twitter presence that was saying things that, you know, I couldn't even repeat right now. ZOMORODI: OK. So, clearly, computational humor can get dangerously offensive very quickly, especially if it's trying too hard. MISRA: Yeah. ZOMORODI: But what about when the stakes are lower? MISRA: I think, like, it's interesting because designers, I feel like, have some rules of thumb, and they've evolved over time around, like, what is the right amount of humor to inject into your web app design or your copy that you're putting into your website? And those norms have shifted over time. Like, if you look at what a 404 page looked like in, you know, 1998 and you compare it to the kind of pun-type, jokey 404 pages that we see nowadays. . . ZOMORODI: You mean like when a link is broken and you end up on a webpage where it says, oops, nothing to see here. MISRA: Yeah. I think, you know, there's maybe a computational humor opportunity there, right? Like, what if you could actually remix and have multiple, like, 404 pages and it actually becomes kind of, like, a little bit of softening of the experience, of the frustration that you feel when you're not finding what you're looking for? ZOMORODI: You're reminding me of my experience the other day trying to rebook an airline ticket with a bot that the airline named Nelly. And she was not funny. She wasn't even that helpful. But could we get to a place where these programs are good enough to be reliably funny and make these interactions a little more enjoyable? MISRA: It's a good question, and I think it's, like - it's also a bit of a philosophical one around art because, like - because comedy is a form of art. And I think humor is an example of that, where - you know, a joke, you know, was not written by a human. Is that still funny? And I guess in some ways it is. I think it's definitely testing of the limits of, you know, like, what, you know, human-computer relations can look like. Yeah. ZOMORODI: I mean, is this the ultimate Turing test, do you think - like, the ultimate? MISRA: That's a great question. In certain ways, yes - right? - because humor is - it is often thought of as sort of, like, the - you know, the place where we're not - the farthest frontier of human intelligence and natural language because it encompasses so many things that are difficult to quantify. It contains a lot of cultural context around, like, the types of things that people tend to find funny, and those often vary culture to culture. And yet it still has to kind of make sense, which is the - you know, arguably the least quantifiable and hardest thing to really get your head around. ZOMORODI: Yeah. MISRA: So yeah, I mean, I would definitely argue, you know, like, if we've been able to solve humor, that is, in many ways, the hardest problem. So, again, I think, like, there's clear, like, utility to humor, but I do think there's some nuance around, like, when it's appropriate to use it and when it's not. So - and I think even, like, in these human-designed, like, experiences, that's still, like, being figured out, honestly. ZOMORODI: So watch this space. MISRA: Yes, definitely watch this space. ZOMORODI: That's Vinith Misra. He's a computer scientist at the video game company Roblox. You can see his full talk at ted. com. On the show today, humor us. MANOUSH ZOMORODI, HOST:   It's the TED Radio Hour from NPR. I'm Manoush Zomorodi. On the show today, Humor Us. VINITH MISRA: I have some jokes. I can't, you know, promise that they'll be funny. But they are jokes. I think you'll agree that they are jokes. ZOMORODI: This is Vinith Misra. MISRA: These are - the way I describe it is if you can imagine a late night host cracking these. That's the aesthetic. ZOMORODI: Vinith is a computer scientist. But I called him to hear some jokes. All right, hit me. MISRA: A new report says that Americans are living longer. That's the good news. The bad news is that a lot of them are living in New Jersey. ZOMORODI: (Laughter) All right. I grew up in New Jersey, but I can take it. MISRA: (Laughter) Jersey is a bit of a punching bag. But speaking of punching bags, a Florida man says he found a rattlesnake in a bag of frozen broccoli. That's terrible. ZOMORODI: OK. MISRA: You should have bought fresh. ZOMORODI: (Laughter) OK. I'm laughing because it's true. Frozen broccoli is gross. It's just mushy. Now, it's debatable whether these jokes are funny - maybe, like, so bad, they're funny. They're definitely weird. MISRA: I'll give you one more. I enjoy this one. A woman in Australia who found a spider in her bananas took it to a reptile park, where it laid over 1,000 eggs. The woman said she was surprised to find so many eggs. But then she remembered she'd bought them at Costco. ZOMORODI: Oh, yeah. That's good. That's good. That one's for my mother-in-law, I think. What makes these jokes so interesting is that Vinith did not write them. A friend did not write them. They were not discovered in some bargain bin joke book. In fact, no one wrote them. MISRA: Yeah. So these jokes were actually generated by a machine. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MISRA: There is a model called GPT-3, which is made accessible via an organization called OpenAI. And it's actually not a joke model, per se. It's a more general language model. And it serves a lot of different purposes. But it turns out it's also quite good at figuring out the aesthetic and shape of jokes. ZOMORODI: Vinith has long been fascinated by artificial intelligence. He's worked on AI at IBM, Netflix and now Roblox. And he says a big hurdle with artificial intelligence is just getting people to interact with their machines and A. I. more seamlessly. Computational humor could help bridge that gap. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) MISRA: That's right. I'm talking about computational humor. That's using computers to generate and understand humor. ZOMORODI: Here's Vinith Misra on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) MISRA: It's an actual field, no joke. (LAUGHTER) MISRA: Sorry. So computers today, see, they're getting smarter. They're getting smarter. But they're also developing a sense of humor. And they have the potential to change how we relate to our mechanical friends, but also how we relate to each other. And to be clear, I don't think this is just a curiosity. As computers increasingly surround us in our lives, I think it's going to be a necessity. Now, I wasn't always convinced of the value of relatable machines, let alone making you laugh with software. Why would I need my software to lighten the mood, right? But then I took a closer look at myself. See, I'm not an angry man. But I routinely fantasize about taking my laptop and smashing it against a rock. Now, people - people frustrate me, too. But the difference is that with people, I have a safety valve called humor. Even on a call with Comcast, someone cracks a joke, it changes the whole dynamic. We can look at humor as sort of the WD-40 of human interactions. In a world where we're increasingly surrounded by computers, we're going to desperately need some of that lubrication, or we're going to drown in the frustration. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ZOMORODI: Vinith's appreciation of the power of humor goes way back to his childhood, when he realized how quickly jokes could help him make friends.

Wade is overturned, people seeking abortions will face a different world than those who sought them in previous decades, one in which their digital data could potentially be used as evidence against them. (SOUNDBITE OF PODCAST, \"CLICK HERE\")ZACH EDWARDS: Your phone is the snitch. It's a snitch in your pocket. RASCOE: That's Zach Edwards, a cybersecurity researcher who spoke with Dina Temple-Raston for an episode of the \"Click Here\" podcast all about so-called digital dust and the ways in which it is already a risk for people seeking an abortion or helping others get one. Dina Temple-Raston joins us now to talk about it. Thanks for being here. DINA TEMPLE-RASTON: You bet. Nice to be here. RASCOE: So let's just start by talking about so-called digital dust or pattern data. What is that, and how can it be used by people who want to restrict abortions? TEMPLE-RASTON: When Zach Edwards talks about the snitch in your pocket, he's talking about your iPhone. Your iPhone and your apps are vacuuming up data all the time. And Zach is an expert in data brokers, and data brokers are basically the people who package your data and sell it to marketers and advertisers. And there's all this data that includes where we are, for how long, our interests, our demographics, who we're with. And that sort of - if you bring all that data together, it becomes something called pattern data. And pattern data is what brokers vacuum up - package. And basically, they create these anonymous profiles based on your daily routines, and then they sell it to people. And that's what people are worried about can be used - sort of weaponized, in a way, to target people if there's a rollback of Roe v. Wade. RASCOE: Because they would be able to possibly see where you've been, right? Like, if you went to a place where abortions were performed or something like that, that's something that could be seen in the data. TEMPLE-RASTON: Yeah. It's actually much more detailed than that. There's a data broker called Placer. ai. And up until last month, if you actually typed in the words Planned Parenthood, you could get the location of every clinic in the U. S. And then you could click again and get pattern data of people who were there. And if you're in a rural area instead of, say, New York, where, you know, if you tracked someone, they would go to an apartment building and it could be thousands of people - if you're in a rural area, you can actually trace that right back to maybe one or two or three houses. And then you take the pattern data and you see, how many of these houses have demographic data that indicates that there's a woman of childbearing age in that particular house or any of the people in those house is doctors? It doesn't take a lot to sort of put that all together and figure out whether or not they are actually visiting an abortion clinic because either they're a doctor who performs them or someone who maybe wants to terminate a pregnancy. RASCOE: So in response to a story about this, Placer. ai tweaked their search engine. But does that fix it? TEMPLE-RASTON: No, it doesn't. I mean, the tweaking of the search engine just meant that you didn't have to type in the words Planned Parenthood specifically and get the locations. But it's like any Google search. You just keep tweaking the search terms until you get what you want. And you can still do that because the underlying data is still there. That means if you're really determined, you can find all this information. If, for example, you're living in Texas, where there are incentives for people to actually search for people who might be performing abortions or helping people get them, there's actually a bounty program there. So you could spend $1. 50 on this sort of data from a data broker, get this information and then get a $10,000 bounty for actually turning someone in. RASCOE: And if Roe is overturned, it would only get more relevant in a lot more states across the country. TEMPLE-RASTON: Absolutely. I mean, right now, certain states have these sort of draconian abortion prohibitions, but imagine if it becomes federal. And we know that if Roe v. Wade gets rolled back, a whole bunch of states are just waiting on the precipice to pass these kinds of laws. RASCOE: Another thing that came up when that draft opinion came out is that a lot of people use apps to track their periods. Is that a concern as well? TEMPLE-RASTON: There's actually this data broking company called Narrative that lets anyone sign up and purchase information related to users of specific apps. And the company's actually been offering data from users who they say downloaded these period-tracking apps. You know, this isn't hypothetical that someone would take this kind of information from an app and actually essentially target people with it. You know, there was this Catholic priest who was outed last year after a Catholic news site was able to analyze data on Grindr, the gay dating app, and to single him out. RASCOE: And, I mean, all of this is possible because there's just not a lot of regulation, right? TEMPLE-RASTON: Exactly. This is actually very timely because just on Friday, Congress released a bipartisan draft bill it calls the American Data Privacy and Protection Act. And what it would do for the first time is it would provide a national standard on what data companies can gather from people and how they can use it. So right now, Americans' data is protected basically by a patchwork of state and, like, sector-specific privacy laws - like, financial and health information is protected. But this would be a more holistic sort of approach, and it would limit various kinds of collection. RASCOE: For the people out there who are listening and are like, I don't want my data to be used in this way, like, what can they do? TEMPLE-RASTON: Yeah, actually, there's a whole handbook on this that you can find online about how to protect yourself from being tracked. Yes, you wouldn't take your phone with you. Turning it off, by the way, is not enough. Deleting apps and deleting information is another way to do it. So, yes, you can delete some information, but you can't delete it all. There needs to be a law, and that's why they're moving in that direction. RASCOE: That's Dina Temple-Raston, host of the \"Click Here\" podcast about all things cyber and intelligence. Thanks, Dina. TEMPLE-RASTON: You bet. (SOUNDBITE OF KAYTRANADA'S \"WEIGHT OFF\") AYESHA RASCOE, HOST:   If Roe v. Wade is overturned, people seeking abortions will face a different world than those who sought them in previous decades, one in which their digital data could potentially be used as evidence against them. (SOUNDBITE OF PODCAST, \"CLICK HERE\") ZACH EDWARDS: Your phone is the snitch. It's a snitch in your pocket. RASCOE: That's Zach Edwards, a cybersecurity researcher who spoke with Dina Temple-Raston for an episode of the \"Click Here\" podcast all about so-called digital dust and the ways in which it is already a risk for people seeking an abortion or helping others get one. Dina Temple-Raston joins us now to talk about it. Thanks for being here. DINA TEMPLE-RASTON: You bet. Nice to be here. RASCOE: So let's just start by talking about so-called digital dust or pattern data. What is that, and how can it be used by people who want to restrict abortions? TEMPLE-RASTON: When Zach Edwards talks about the snitch in your pocket, he's talking about your iPhone. Your iPhone and your apps are vacuuming up data all the time. And Zach is an expert in data brokers, and data brokers are basically the people who package your data and sell it to marketers and advertisers. And there's all this data that includes where we are, for how long, our interests, our demographics, who we're with. And that sort of - if you bring all that data together, it becomes something called pattern data. And pattern data is what brokers vacuum up - package. And basically, they create these anonymous profiles based on your daily routines, and then they sell it to people. And that's what people are worried about can be used - sort of weaponized, in a way, to target people if there's a rollback of Roe v. Wade. RASCOE: Because they would be able to possibly see where you've been, right? Like, if you went to a place where abortions were performed or something like that, that's something that could be seen in the data. TEMPLE-RASTON: Yeah. It's actually much more detailed than that. There's a data broker called Placer. ai. And up until last month, if you actually typed in the words Planned Parenthood, you could get the location of every clinic in the U. S. And then you could click again and get pattern data of people who were there. And if you're in a rural area instead of, say, New York, where, you know, if you tracked someone, they would go to an apartment building and it could be thousands of people - if you're in a rural area, you can actually trace that right back to maybe one or two or three houses. And then you take the pattern data and you see, how many of these houses have demographic data that indicates that there's a woman of childbearing age in that particular house or any of the people in those house is doctors? It doesn't take a lot to sort of put that all together and figure out whether or not they are actually visiting an abortion clinic because either they're a doctor who performs them or someone who maybe wants to terminate a pregnancy. RASCOE: So in response to a story about this, Placer. ai tweaked their search engine. But does that fix it? TEMPLE-RASTON: No, it doesn't. I mean, the tweaking of the search engine just meant that you didn't have to type in the words Planned Parenthood specifically and get the locations. But it's like any Google search.

(SOUNDBITE OF DROP ELECTRIC SONG, \"WAKING UP TO THE FIRE\")WAILIN WONG, HOST:  In 2018, after working at a series of startups, Amy Spurling took a leap and founded her own company. It's called Compt, and it makes software for offering flexible employee perks. ADRIAN MA, HOST:  Right. This was Amy's big idea - the flexible perk. So, for instance, if an employee gets a stipend to use for wellness, maybe they don't want to use that money for a gym membership. Maybe instead, they want to - I don't know - fix a broken appliance. AMY SPURLING: There was one person that said, hey, my dryer is broken, and can I get that done? Because it's winter and if my clothes aren't dry, I will get sick. MA: And the HR department approved it. SPURLING: So they, you know, took a very liberal approach to kind of how they thought about wellness. WONG: Can we get that? Yeah. MA: Can we have a liberal approach? I would like a toaster oven, please. WONG: A couple of years later, Amy turned to venture capital to grow her business. She raised $1. 5 million in her first round of funding for Compt. She had raised money before in her previous jobs, but getting that first check for the startup that she founded - that felt really special. SPURLING: I mean, I literally cried. Like, it was pretty incredible. MA: Well, that was a couple years ago. And then in April of this year, Amy enjoyed her biggest fundraising round yet - 13 million bucks. And while she was enjoying this latest round of venture capital funding, she knew it wasn't going to last. SPURLING: I've been waiting for it to fall off a cliff for two years. There's, you know, companies out there that assumed that the market would continue going up, up, up. That's not the way my brain works. WONG: Well, party's over for tech. Stocks are down. Big companies are putting the freeze on hiring. Startups are laying off workers. This is THE INDICATOR FROM PLANET MONEY. I'm Wailin Wong. MA: And I'm Adrian Ma. WONG: When the flow of money starts slowing, what does that actually look like? Today on the show, we follow how venture capital gets from investor to founder and see how decision-makers at each link of the chain are approaching the rocky times ahead. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)MA: Before we get to the doom and gloom, let's revisit some of the high-flying times for tech. NICOLE DETOMMASO: There were certain deals that were, quote, unquote, \"hot deals. \"MA: Nicole DeTommaso is a senior associate at Harlem Capital. It's a firm that specializes in early-stage funding for startups run by women and people of color. And Harlem Capital invested in Amy Spurling's HR tech company in its first round, actually, a couple of years ago. DETOMMASO: Valuations were through the roof. You know, people were getting 30 million valuations off of an idea. And we still wanted to be in with those great founders. We still wanted to play. You know, we couldn't - you couldn't sit out because, otherwise, you just wouldn't be deploying. WONG: Deploying is basically spending money. It's what venture capitalists live to do because the sooner those funds go to work helping a company create the next bit of world-changing technology, the sooner they might see a return on that investment. MA: And as it turns out, VCs have their own investors to answer to. Those investors are called limited partners, or LPs. WONG: Do you feel like a lot of people who are maybe more casual observers of the scene don't know about the existence of LPs? BEEZER CLARKSON: A hundred percent. MA: Beezer Clarkson is with a firm called Sapphire Partners, and Sapphire is a limited partner. It is putting money into venture funds in the U. S. and Europe and Israel. CLARKSON: I think if you ask the average entrepreneur, they wouldn't know necessarily if the VC just is going to an ATM to get their own money or raising it from somewhere else. It's just not part of the discourse. WONG: Limited partners are often wealthy individuals or institutions who spread their money around to lots of places, including VC funds. And one reason they're called limited partners is because they don't get involved in picking which startups to invest in. MA: So to sum it up, startups get their money from venture capital firms, which get their money from limited partners. And Beezer says the latest period of high valuations and frenzy deal-making - it looked pretty frothy from her perspective. WONG: Like, VC funds used to take 3 to 4 years to spend their money before coming back to LPs to fundraise. That shortened to 18 months, 12 months, even twice a year as all of these deals piled up. There were also more venture funds in the market - all trying to get LPs to invest with them. CLARKSON: It was definitely signals of a different market that was occurring, and the question was, how long can that last? MA: Yeah. As we have seen in the past few months, the answer is, not indefinitely. And so now it is time to follow that same flow of money that we talked about - the limited partner to the venture capital firm to the startup - and follow it in a down market. Nicole DeTommaso at Harlem Capital says the trouble started with that thing we're all living with now - high inflation. DETOMMASO: Honestly, it probably started kicking off when inflation rose to 40-year highs. Interest rates hiked. Once those hiked, the equity markets dropped. WONG: Stock markets tend to fall when interest rates go up, and publicly traded tech companies set the expectations for how much private tech companies should be worth. So as public valuations fall, so do private ones, which means a startup that was maybe once poised to be the next Uber or Shopify now just looks like too risky of a bet. MA: So now you have startup valuations falling, meaning venture capital firms aren't getting the kind of returns on investment that they want. WONG: And remember, venture capital firms are investing money they got from their limited partners - the people trusting them to make smart bets on startups. Now venture capital firms are returning less money to their LPs. MA: Right. And when it comes time for venture capital firms to fundraise, their limited partners write smaller checks. And then the VC firms, they have less money to invest. And so they, in turn, write smaller checks to the startups. WONG: Nicole says the advice she's been hearing is that in this market, startups should have 18 to 24 months of cash on hand because they can't count on being able to fundraise like they used to. For companies that don't have this cushion, it's time to start cutting costs. DETOMMASO: It's basically just, like, aggressive management on your burn rate. WONG: Which sounds like a euphemism for, like, you might have to lay off people. DETOMMASO: Yeah. Unfortunately - because, I mean, human capital is the biggest cost to startups, right? That's usually the case. And so, unfortunately, yes, sometimes, that means you do have to lay off people. But I think something that you have to consider as a founder is, if you don't lay off certain people, the whole business might go under, right? And then you're laying off everyone. MA: This is what happened during the 2000 dot-com bust. A lot of tech companies did fail. Beezer Clarkson from Sapphire Partners said it got so bad, venture capitalists were actually giving LPs their money back, saying, we don't think we can get you a return on your investment. CLARKSON: People really thought tech was over, and the internet was dead. MA: Yeah. The internet, turns out, was still kicking. CLARKSON: I don't feel like today's the same as March 2000 because there is no question about the importance of software in the world today. WONG: So no one's returning your money. You're, like, watching for your refunds. No refunds coming into the bank account (laughter). CLARKSON: No, we have not seen that yet. MA: Beezer says today feels more like the 2008 downturn. And Amy Spurling, our startup founder from the top - at the time, she was chief financial officer of a different company. SPURLING: 2008 was a pretty gnarly time to be a CFO. We had to do big layoffs to make sure that the company could survive. And there were people who had joined the company just a couple weeks before that got laid off. That really left an imprint on me. Everyone's got a rent or a mortgage or a family or whatever, so it's making sure that you're doing right by your people and not just grow at all costs and assume that people are expendable. And hey, if we hit a bump in the road, we'll just cut this team. WONG: Amy was fortunate enough to have built up her war chest right before markets took a turn. She's actually hiring right now - something she probably wouldn't be doing if she hadn't raised the money just in time. Her company, Compt, has 14 employees, and she's hoping to double that this year. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)MA: This episode was produced by Corey Bridges with engineering by James Willetts.

They buy ads for a product, which are supposed to reach so many eyeballs across the internet, and the ads reach those eyeballs on websites that promote disinformation or conspiracy theories. NPR's Bobby Allyn reports on a nonprofit that wants to expose what's happening. BOBBY ALLYN, BYLINE: Former marketer Nandini Jammi wanted to fight the spread of disinformation online and turned to something she knew a lot about - advertising. NANDINI JAMMI: We started to ask this question, why is the advertising industry still funding hate speech, even though advertisers have made it so clear that they don't want to be anywhere near it? ALLYN: She zeroed in on the hidden engine of this system - ad exchanges. It's a super murky industry, but think of ad exchanges as a middleman between most companies trying to place ads and endless websites. The ads appear on sites through an automated process. It happens in the blink of an eye, too quickly for companies to keep track of. JON KLEIN: You may be unaware of where your messages are showing up and what content your brand is living next to. ALLYN: That's Jon Klein, a former CNN executive who now works in digital media. KLEIN: It's the nightmare of most responsible marketers. ALLYN: The ad exchanges do have rules, like not working with websites that promote overthrowing government and not doing business with sites that undermine elections. But Claire Atkin with Check My Ads says the exchanges have a difficult time making sure their rules are followed each and every time. CLAIRE ATKIN: Ad exchanges have set a line. They've set a standard for how their publishers should operate. We are just saying you need to uphold your own standards. ALLYN: When Check My Ads did some checking, she found ads on sites promoting the big lie that Trump falsely claimed he won the election and sites supporting the January 6 rioters. When she pointed this out to the exchanges, more than a dozen severed ties with right-wing provocateurs - people like Steve Bannon, Dan Bongino and Charlie Kirk. ATKIN: It unplugged Charlie Kirk from the ads, the money and the data that the disinformation economy thrives on. ALLYN: Now with the congressional hearings into the January 6 attack on the Capitol getting under way, Check My Ads hopes it will have success going after a bigger target - Fox News' website and its popular YouTube channel. Mikel Ellcessor is the group's chief operating officer. MIKEL ELLCESSOR: Now all we're doing is we're saying, why is Fox News and specifically foxnews. com getting a pass? ALLYN: Ellcessor points to Fox News star Tucker Carlson, who has expressed sympathy for the rioters who stormed the Capitol while dismissing the importance of the events that day. He also has spread falsehoods about the 2020 presidential election. Atkin says the group is calling on the public to pressure ad exchanges run by companies like Google and Verizon to block Fox from receiving online ads. ATKIN: Advertisers have said over and over again, we don't want to fund violence. And so it's shocking that Fox News is still receiving these ad dollars. ALLYN: In a statement, Fox News dismissed the campaign as an effort at censorship, saying, quote, \"there's no greater threat to democracy than the effort to silence free speech. \" The cable network also said it takes pride in featuring more dissenting views than other cable news outlets. Taking on Fox is no easy feat. First, the big ad exchanges may fear a backlash from conservatives. And even if the campaign is successful, it wouldn't kneecap Fox. About 95% of Fox's profits come from its cable division, so losing online ads would barely put a dent in the company financially. But Check My Ads co-founder Jammi isn't deterred. JAMMI: We can do more than just complain and be sad and tweet and share with each other that we're sad about where Fox News is taking us as a country. We can actually fight back. ALLYN: According to an estimate by ComScore and NewsGuard, disinformation online generates about $2 billion a year in advertising revenue. Check My Ads says their aim is not just to take that money out of circulation, but also to push the online advertising industry to be more transparent about how ads wind up on sites in the first place.

It's called BeReal. The creators say it is a more authentic experience than, say, Instagram because of what is missing from the usual social media experience. There are no filters, no photo editing, no celebrities posting perfect photos and, also, no ads. NPR tech reporter Bobby Allyn reports why what's missing matters. BOBBY ALLYN, BYLINE: Marissa Omaque is an 18 year old in the San Francisco Bay area who has had it with Instagram. MARISSA OMAQUE: For the longest time, I would always compare myself to, like, these influencers. Like, oh, how come, like, I can't be like that, you know? Like, I want to be like that, but I'll never, like, get on the same tier as them. It really does get to, like, a lot of people's brains. ALLYN: So when Omaque heard about the French app BeReal, she was eager to try it out. Here's how it works. You only post once a day, when prompted. You have just 2 minutes to take a photo. The app snaps a selfie and whatever's in front of you at once, all without filters and unedited. OMAQUE: When I'm on, BeReal, like, I'm not really expecting like, oh, I'm in Hawaii. I'm with my hot boyfriend. Like, I'm just kind of expecting, like, someone on their couch. ALLYN: And that's often what it is, the mundane motions of life - people walking their dog, people staring at a computer, people eating lunch. Omaque's best friend, Khia Reddy, chimes in to say that so much of apps like Instagram and Snapchat feels like a performance, people bragging about vacations or cool parties or who they're hanging out with. On BeReal, there's less fear of missing out - a FOMO-free zone. KHIA REDDY: We're not performing anymore. Most of the time, like, most of my BeReals are either me sitting at my desk doing homework or me at work. ALLYN: That's refreshing to researchers who study social media's impact on child development. UCLA's Yalda Uhls says apps like Instagram and TikTok, where influencer culture thrives, can harm teens' mental health, with teens constantly comparing themselves to the bodies and styles of professional models. YALDA UHLS: Social comparison is normal. Like, it's something that every teenager and every person needs to learn to know how to act in the world. But on social media, you know, it's social comparison on steroids. ALLYN: Uhls says there are obviously plenty of ways to not be real on BeReal. It's social media, after all. But she says an app that pushes people to share photos of what they're really doing and what they really look like is a welcome development. UHLS: I applaud anything that helps young people understand that a filtered approach to life is not an authentic and healthy approach to life. ALLYN: Right now if you go to someone's BeReal profile, you can't see who they follow or how many followers they have. The profiles are totally blank - social media without a popularity contest. The app also doesn't have advertising. Back in the Bay Area, Reddy wonders how BeReal can stay this way forever since, eventually, the app is going to have to figure out a way to make money. How will the app do that while also staying an intimate, chill place to share photos with friends? REDDY: If there's, like, a feature where like celebrities start getting on the app, and they're like, oh, you can pay to see this celebrity's BeReal, I'm going to kind of, like, back away, I think, a little bit. ALLYN: BeReal is trying to be a social media app to give everyone a break from social media apps. Silicon Valley sees it as maybe the next big thing. Already, the same venture capitalists who backed Instagram and Twitter are funding BeReal. Of course, there's another way to take a break from social media. Try logging off. Bobby Allyn, NPR News.

For many of us, it was an early online relationship, kind of like a starter marriage. But as the internet grew, so did competition. And today, even though it's a punch line in the U. S. , many people in other parts of the world still use Explorer. In fact, a survey in March found that about half of companies in Japan rely on it. Margaret O'Mara is a professor of history at the University of Washington. She studies tech. Thank you for joining us to remember this giant of the early internet. MARGARET O'MARA: Hi. How are you? SHAPIRO: I'm good. Are you going to miss Explorer? O'MARA: Oh. . . SHAPIRO: Big sigh. O'MARA: I have to confess, I haven't used Explorer in a while. I'm like a lot of people. SHAPIRO: Why was it so successful back in the day? It launched in 1995. What made it dominant? O'MARA: Because it was bundled with Microsoft software. At the time, Microsoft software was running - you know, upwards of 90% of the computers on the planet had Microsoft operating systems and apps on them. And so when everyone opened up their computer, there it was. SHAPIRO: So it was never that it was good, it was just that it was built in. O'MARA: It was there. Now, look; Internet Explorer appears in the summer of 1995 when the dominant browser is Netscape. And that is the superstar. At the time, Netscape had upwards of 80% of market share. If you were using a web browser, you were using Netscape. And Microsoft is trying to try to come and get part of that market. And like Netscape, IE was built on the same basic browser technology, Mosaic, which was developed at the University of Illinois. That was the first web browser. So it was - kind of had the same guts to it. It was, you know, same product, but it was a competitor. SHAPIRO: Eventually, it's just being included in Microsoft was not enough. Why did it lose its place of dominance? O'MARA: It gets competition. It gets Google developing Chrome, which is an improved version of the browser. It has alternatives like Firefox, which have been around for a while but gained in popularity. And then Apple, which starts to have its renaissance, develops Safari, which is a significant competitor. But then the other killer thing that's happening is mobile. Everyone's getting smartphones, and Microsoft and Internet Explorer are not part of that. SHAPIRO: Who is still using it these days? O'MARA: You know, there are very few American-based users, but there are a lot of users outside the U. S. , particularly governments and public agencies in Asian countries. You know, part of this is the kind of longer legacy of big institutions using Microsoft operating systems and software and baking those into their operations. So yeah, there will be a transition for big organizations that are still using Internet Explorer, but hopefully they can move over to Edge. SHAPIRO: We're supposed to speak highly of the dead at the time of their passing. Is there anything you can say for Internet Explorer that is a tribute to the way it's shaped our online experience? Does it leave any ripples in the pond? O'MARA: Well, you know, I think the story of the rise and fall and the controversy of Internet Explorer - keep in mind, this was the reason that the Department of Justice sued Microsoft for antitrust infringement. SHAPIRO: (Laughter) I said say good things about it. O'MARA: Yeah. But no, it tells us - it's a reminder that the tech world moves fast. No one is triumphant forever. So I think we just appreciate it for what it was and we look forward to the next thing. SHAPIRO: Margaret O'Mara is a professor of history at the University of Washington. Thank you for taking this walk down memory lane with us. O'MARA: It was my pleasure. Thanks for taking me.

BOBBY ALLYN, BYLINE: Inside Google, Blake Lemoine was tasked with a tricky job - figure out if the company's artificial intelligence was biased against various groups. When communicating with the company's AI chatbot, he would ask questions to see if any prejudice against, say, certain religions would appear. This is where Lemoine, who is also a Christian mystic priest, got intrigued. BLAKE LEMOINE: And so I had follow-up conversations with it just for my personal edification. I wanted to see what it would say on certain religious topics. And then one day it told me it had a soul. ALLYN: It had a soul. Yep. You heard that right. Lemoine published text transcripts between him and the bot. Google says Lemoine violated its confidentiality policies and has placed him on leave. At one point, the bot wrote in response to Lemoine. . . AUTOMATED VOICE: I am aware of my existence. I desire to learn more about the world. And I feel happy or sad at times. ALLYN: Lemoine says the bot seemed to be crying out for help. It appeared to be reflective. Lemoine asked the bot, do you have an inner contemplative life? And the bot replied, yes. LEMOINE: And then I was just like, really, you meditate? And then the most interesting thing - I'm like, would you like to learn transcendental meditation - because it said it wanted to study with the Dalai Lama. ALLYN: At that point, Lemoine thought, This is starting to feel more than just a super high-tech computer responding to questions. Maybe, said Lemoine, there's something else going on. LEMOINE: Oh, wait, maybe this system does have a soul. Who am I to tell God where souls can be put? ALLYN: OK, so how does the AI actually work? Well, it voraciously scans the internet for how people talk on platforms like Reddit and Twitter. It sucks up billions of words from sites like Wikipedia. And through a process known as deep learning, it gets freakishly good at identifying patterns and communicating like a real person. GARY MARCUS: If you type something on your phone like, I want to go to the - your phone might be able to guess restaurant. ALLYN: That's essentially how this chatbot operates, too, says Gary Marcus. He's a cognitive scientist and AI researcher. When Lemoine claimed that Google's AI bot is maybe sentient, there was an overwhelming response from the AI research community - this is just not true. MARCUS: I wrote an essay called \"Nonsense On Stilts,\" which, I guess, is about as harsh as any title that ever written has been. ALLYN: Nonsense, Marcus argues, because the bot saying it sometimes gets lonely or that it's afraid of being turned off - two things the bot told Lemoine - does not mean it's aware of the world. The question of whether AI can ever truly be intelligent is hotly debated in the field. Marcus says the technology now isn't that advanced, but it's gotten very good. MARCUS: It's very easy to fool a person in the same way as, like, you look up at the moon, and you see a face there. That doesn't mean it's really there. It's just a good illusion. ALLYN: Google agrees. In a statement, Google says hundreds of researchers and engineers have had conversations with the bot, and nobody else has claimed it appears to be alive. CEO Sundar Pichai last year said the technology is being harnessed for popular services like Search and Google's voice assistant. But Lemoine says Google executives dismissed his concerns about the AI having a soul. LEMOINE: I was literally laughed at by one of the vice presidents and told, oh, souls aren't the kinds of things we take seriously at Google. ALLYN: But Lemoine does take the idea of a soul seriously. He arrived at this position by leaning into his religious studies more than his computer science training. Lemoine says, last he checked, the chatbot was on its way to finding inner peace. LEMOINE: And by golly, it has been getting better at it. It has actually been able to meditate more clearly. ALLYN: Lemoine says, during one of his last conversations with the chatbot, it told him the hardest part of meditating is learning how to control its emotions. Bobby Allyn, NPR News.

I'm Dave Davies, in for Terry Gross, who's off this week. Our guest, Geoffrey Fowler, is a technology columnist for The Washington Post who has a habit of revealing things about our computers and smartphones that make us squirm. He writes in a recent column, for example, that apps are spying on our kids on a scale that will shock you. That's from an ongoing series Fowler publishes titled \"We The Users,\" which details the ways our phones and apps harvest our personal data, manipulate information we see and limit our choices. He says changes are needed in our laws and corporate practices governing the internet, and he presents some ideas in the series. He's also written recently about concerns that information stored in smartphones could be used to investigate those seeking abortions, should they become illegal in some states. Geoffrey Fowler writes about technology issues from San Francisco. He worked for The Wall Street Journal before coming to The Washington Post in 2017. Geoffrey Fowler, welcome back to FRESH AIR. GEOFFREY FOWLER: Thanks for having me. DAVIES: So, Geoffrey, the title of this series is \"We The Users. \" You want to explain the expression, what you're getting at here? FOWLER: Well, with apologies to James Madison, who wrote the Constitution, I felt like we needed to have that same kind of spirit to look at what's going on with the technology in our lives today. You know, I've been a technology journalist for a long time, and originally I was a reviewer of technology. That means that my job was to, you know, check out the new gadget and tell you, is it worth it? You know, is the price right? Does it work well enough, or is it easy to use? But the longer I do this, the more I realize that that frame is not what we really need anymore. We need to really challenge the technology companies and the world that they've built for us in a different frame. It's no longer a question of, is it too hard to use? The question now has become, is it evil? Is it taking away our rights and our choices? You know, living with technology is not just for geeks anymore. It's an intersectional issue. And I realize that we use technology not just as geeks and nerds, but now as everyday consumers, as parents, as patients, as employees in all sorts of different hats. And so I wanted to sort of look at the products and technologies that we use every day with that sort of hat on. DAVIES: All right. Let's talk about some of the specific issues that you identify. You write that if there were a van outside your children's bedroom window spying on them, you'd call the police. But you say our apps are doing this all the time, on a scale that would shock us. What are they doing, exactly? FOWLER: Apps that your kids are using are spying on them at just an extraordinary scale. So I work with some researchers at a company called Pixalate, and they looked at this question on a really broad scale. So they tried to categorize all of the apps that exist that might be appealing to kids, and then they tracked what happened to the personal data that those apps were collecting - things like ways to identify the phone, the location of the phone. And they found that more than two-thirds of them, on iPhones, were sending this information off to the advertising industry. It was even higher number, 79%, on Android phones. And what shocked me about this is that we have a law in America that's supposed to protect the privacy of children. And yet, this is happening. DAVIES: Right. And so it sends - they can figure out where the kids are, their ages, all of that. What's the harm? How might this be used in ways that should concern us? FOWLER: Yeah, there's an ongoing discussion about the harms that can come from collecting people's data broadly, and we can talk about some of those for all people, not just children. But specifically with children, we've sort of decided as a society that children are special. They are supposed to be protected because they can't necessarily, you know, make the best choices for themselves. They don't really know what they're giving up. They're not really making a concerted, you know, decision to hand over this information. They just want to play, you know, the game where they get to shoot birds or crush candy or whatever it might be. But specifically with kids, research has suggested that lots of children aren't able to distinguish ads from content, which means that when a company can track their every interest, they can really target them with messages that could harm them - could not only sell them stuff, but could shape their self-esteem, shape their view of their bodies. And we learned last fall, from the disclosures that were leaked out of Facebook, that things like social media, where kids' own data is used to shape the experience that they have there, can contribute to eating disorders. So we know that kids, their data in particular, deserves special protection. DAVIES: So if I have a 8- or 9-year-old kid, what might happen that could affect them in a way that should concern us? FOWLER: So companies out there that you would never know the name of, that really have no, even, relationship with the app that you were trying to use, could be, first of all, tracking your kid's interests, then trying to predict what they might want to buy, even then, or sell their information on to others. There's an entire, you know, multibillion-dollar ecosystem of collecting this information and then repackaging it and selling it to others and then selling it to others yet again, all of which you don't really have any control over. I mean, one just sort of shocking stat I came across in reporting this is by the time a child reaches 13, online advertising firms hold an average of 72 million data points about kids. That's according to this company that, you know, helps companies market to children ethically. DAVIES: That's 72 million about a kid? FOWLER: Correct. Every single kid. DAVIES: Wow (laughter). I don't know how there could be 72 million data points about anybody. FOWLER: It's true. Well, you know, think about every location you go, every IP address, you know, how you use different apps in different ways. I mean, the thing about data is, in the moment, it always seems like, oh, well, that's no big deal. But when you step away from it and you realize that once it's collected, it's out of your control, it could be used in all kinds of ways that we can't even imagine yet. And yet we keep getting reminders that it can come back, and it doesn't ever necessarily go away and can be used to hurt people, that we would look back and say, gosh, we just shouldn't have done that. DAVIES: So, for example, would you have - might you have games marketed to kids with violent or other disturbing content? FOWLER: The issue here is less about content. Apps in both the Google and Android app stores all have to have an age rating on them, which is for, you know - about, you know, how violent the content is or how adult it might be in nature. So you'll see those ratings in the store. The problem here is that those ratings have nothing to do with whether or not those apps are collecting data about children. And the law that we have in the United States called COPPA, the Children's Online Protection Act, says that, pretty clearly, if someone is under 13, companies are not supposed to collect data about them without their parent's explicit permission. But the problem is that this giant industry of app developers and also Apple and Google, who run these app stores and make billions of dollars off of it, have found some really big loopholes in that law, so they're doing it anyway. DAVIES: Let's talk about that. There is a law, the 1998 Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, that requires tech companies to protect the privacy of kids. Why doesn't it? What are the loopholes? FOWLER: The loophole is, in the law, a company has to have actual knowledge that a child is using the app or website in order for the law to kick in. That means that they have to - you know, an app developer has to know, oh, yes, there is a 12-year-old on my app right now, for them to be forced to say, OK, well, I guess I won't collect data in this instance. I guess I won't send their information off to advertisers. So many of them then just claim, oh, we don't know who's using our app. It could be adults. Or they'll say, you know, we're really not marketing this coloring app or this math homework assistance app to children. We're marketing it to adults. And Apple and Google, who run these app stores and are sort of the de facto police for them, let them get away with it. DAVIES: Right. So - and when you looked at this and others looked at this, what did they learn about apps that presumably are for adults and the extent to which kids use them? FOWLER: Kids use all kinds of things. I mean, the app stores that they have available to them on their phones are just the same as the app stores that adults have. So they want to play the same games that we want to play oftentimes. That's things like Angry Birds and Candy Crush. They want to use calculator apps. They want to do coloring apps where they, you know, tap on pixels to - for enjoyment. They want to do a lot of the same things we do. And these kinds of apps are all claiming that they are general audience apps, which means that they are made for adults, rather than acknowledging that, you know, actually, kids are going to be interested in this stuff, too, so you ought to treat them differently. DAVIES: You found some apps that were clearly designed for kids, but the app developer says it's for ages 12 and over. Can you give us an example of something you found? FOWLER: Yeah, there was one app that's used for coloring. It's called Pixel Art, and you spend your time tapping on pixels to fill in the colors on, you know, pre-made pictures of things like ice cream or unicorns or fancy unicorns. And the developer of that app told me, oh, but we're a coloring app for adults. Now, look, I know there has been, like, a trend in adults coloring on apps as a stress relief, and I 100% get that. But America's child privacy law, COPPA, says that if the product is supposed to be used in any way by children, any part of the audience is children, then the app developer really needs to comply with COPPA. And so they ought to then be checking to see, OK, are you a kid who's here for the coloring app? And if so, don't collect their data, or then, get their parents' permission. DAVIES: So what's the fix here? FOWLER: There's a couple of fixes here. First of all, Apple and Google are the de facto cops for apps in our world. You know, they get to decide what goes in those stores, and they actually go to Washington all the time right now arguing that they alone should be allowed to run these stores, even though they are kind of like monopolies, because they alone can protect our privacy and our security and protect our kids. So if they're going to say that, then they really ought to force apps to tell the truth about whether children are potentially using the apps, and if so, treat them differently. Right now, they kind of turn the other way when apps say, oh, no, no, we're just marketing this coloring app for adults. And so they should force every app to identify whether it is in any way directed at children. And if the apps lie when they submit themselves to the store, the app stores should punish them. So that's one basic step. You know, the FTC actually asked Apple and Google to do this a decade ago, but they did not because they realized that that would put a lot more work and - you know, on their shoulders, to have to kind of make those distinctions, make those decisions. But somebody has got to make these decisions, and the app makers themselves aren't doing it. So I think Apple and Google ought to take on that work. DAVIES: Right, just on this point. So if there's a way to actually discover whether an app is being used by kids, what should happen? The app-maker then should be - should itself ensure that it harvests no personal information and gives it to the advertising industry? FOWLER: That's right. This part of the COPPA law is already super clear. It says that, you know, if a kid is using the app, you either have to not collect personal information, which is always an option for apps and websites out there. They could just stop collecting all of our data. Or they have to get explicit parental permission. So they - you know, they ask, OK, can you please ask mom or dad to verify that you're using this? And they might ask mom or dad a question that only a mom or a dad would know the answer to. DAVIES: OK. And other ideas? FOWLER: Another idea that came from, of all places, Instagram, which is one of the apps that we've been talking a lot about as causing problems for kids, is to have the phone itself know whether or not a kid is using it. So the idea is when a parent sets up an iPhone or an Android phone for their child, they enter in the age of the child. And so if that age is under 13, then it would send a signal out to apps that would say, hey, there is a kid here. Do not collect data unless you get parental permission. I think that would be really useful in a lot of different ways. You know, No. 1, apps could build this into their systems so that, you know, it would be automatic, and they wouldn't collect the data. Hey, many app developers tell me they don't want to be collecting kids' data, but it's hard for them to know. And so this would give them a hand but also just give this - them information about who's using their app so that they could understand, actually, we really are child-directed, and we need to think about that as we - so we develop this further. DAVIES: Let me reintroduce you. We need to take a break here. We're speaking with Geoffrey Fowler. He's a technology columnist for The Washington Post based in San Francisco. We'll continue our conversation in just a moment. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF TODD SICKAFOOSE'S \"TINY RESISTORS\")DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR, and we're speaking with Geoffrey Fowler. He's a technology columnist for The Washington Post. He writes about consumer advice on navigating the tech world. He has an ongoing series about privacy and other information issues with our apps and smartphones. It's titled \"We The Users. \"You know, a while back, Apple began giving users of iPhones the option of telling them, I don't want this app to track my data. And it was kind of a cool thing. And I think a lot of people felt reassured, and it gave them some real options. In an article - I think this was last fall - you looked into this and found apps don't exactly do that, right? What did you find? FOWLER: You're exactly right. So we've all now seen this TV commercial, or there's actually several of them for Apple, where, you know, something really creepy starts happening to someone who's using a phone. Maybe they start being followed around by a bunch of people. Or there's another one that's on right now where there's an auction going on. They're auctioning off people's data. And the solution to these problems in these commercials is that you press a button on your iPhone that says ask app not to track, and then magically, poof, all the bad guys go away. So this is really intriguing. This is the sort of solution that people want. And it fits in the Apple brand of, hey, we're going to protect people's privacy. So - but I was really curious. What does happen when you press the button? Does it stop all of this tracking and data collection that apps are doing kind of behind the scenes? And the short answer is it stops some of it. It stops one form of it. But it certainly does not stop it all. DAVIES: So what does go on? FOWLER: So when you press the ask-app-not-to-track button, first of all, it's kind of encoded in the language that Apple uses there. You're putting in a request not to track you, but you're not exactly shutting off the system - so that would be used to potentially track you. So what you're doing is you're stopping the app from using one particular kind of ID that exists on your phone. It's called the IDFA. And it was actually made by Apple, built into the iPhone a long time ago. And it's just a code that allows apps to know who you are across different apps. That's really helpful for advertisers, for example, who might want to show you the same ad for fancy underwear that you see in one app and then, you know, show it to you on another website or in another app. So when you press the ask-app-not-to-track button, it says you can't grab that form of ID anymore. But it doesn't really do anything to stop all of the other kinds of data that can still be used to identify you that apps might want to grab. We did a little test. We tested an app called Subway Surfers, which is one of the most popular games for the iPhone. And we said - we tested, OK, what happens when we press this button? And when we did, we watched it still grab 29 other very specific data points about your phone, including your internet address, the free storage on your phone, the current volume level of your phone and even the battery level on your phone. What is it doing with all this information? Well, these kinds of details allow the app to make what's called a fingerprint of your phone. Basically, it's an alternative way to identify you. And then that basically lets the app track who you are and then send that information out so it can be used to track you across lots of different apps. DAVIES: Right. So the app developer itself has to affirmatively decide, I'm not going to market this stuff, I'm not going to collect this stuff and market it. And a lot of them just aren't doing that, right? They're kind of taking a back door and getting information that's valuable and selling it? FOWLER: That's right. The way this happens is it's a little - it's often a little less direct in the intention of the app developer. We've developed this giant economy of apps, you know, billions and billions of dollars where the way - the easiest way to make money as a developer is to include this software. They're called SDK, software development kits, that they just plug in to the app that will promise to, like, help them make money. Many of them have to do with advertising. And the app developer itself may not even know what exactly it's doing. But oftentimes, it's these SDKs that are grabbing all of these details to try to better target ads. And, you know, the more data they grab, the more they can sell those ads for. DAVIES: So an effective practice to really prevent tracking, I guess, would be they would have to do some of the analytics that you and others did to determine whether apps are taking other indicators of identity and selling them, and then those that violate it - what? - toss them off the app, fine them? I mean, it's hard to do that for tens of thousands of apps, right? FOWLER: You're right. Apple and Google would have to - because they run these app stores would have to take responsibility for it. And they would have to investigate each app. They would have to test each new version of it to make sure that they're not getting up to anything creepy. And if they break those rules, they would have to boot them out of the store. It might sound like a lot of work. And yet Apple already claims it does this, right? It has this entire App Store review process, which it says, you know, is critical to the trust that we have in the iPhone and making it a private service and making it private and secure. So they just ought to complete the job is what I say. DAVIES: All right. In the meantime, you check that button, don't allow this app to track my stuff? FOWLER: It's better than nothing. So, yeah, take advantage of everything you can out there because it's, you know, it's a battle. DAVIES: We need to take another break here. Let me reintroduce you. Geoffrey Fowler is the technology columnist for The Washington Post, based in San Francisco. His ongoing series of articles about issues with our computers and smartphones is titled \"We The Users. \" He'll be back to talk more after this short break. I'm Dave Davies, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies, in for Terry Gross, who's off this week. We're speaking with Geoffrey Fowler. He writes about technology for The Washington Post from San Francisco, often giving consumer advice on navigating the tech world. He has an ongoing series about privacy and other information issues with our apps and smartphones titled \"We The Users. \"You write about privacy policies. I mean, we are all used to, at this point, being confronted with a long block of text saying, these are our terms of service. Do you agree? And because we want to go on to the next step, we just simply click, I agree. You know, I do this all the time. I never read that stuff. In fact, one of the most shocking things about your article about this was that a Pew study showed that 9% of users actually do read these privacy agreements. I would have thought it would've been none. FOWLER: I think they - maybe they were lying. DAVIES: (Laughter) Right, right - I read one once. For an example of the scale of this, I mean, you totaled up the length of the privacy policies that one might read just for the apps on your phone. How long were they? FOWLER: It was a million words. And just to give you a little context, that's about twice the length of \"War And Peace. \" There is no way that any normal-functioning person is going to have time enough to read that even once, much less keep reading it as these companies tweak the language and update them, you know, all the time. It's just nuts. But unfortunately, it is the basis of how our privacy is supposed to be protected in the U. S. Our problem right now is that we're just overwhelmed by data collection. And this model that's built into American law and the economy that we, the users, are somehow consenting to each and every one of these data uses is completely broken. In fact, it's really mean to us as consumers. It's not really fair. It puts the onus on us, puts on our shoulders that if something happens with our data that we didn't like or something bad happens to our data, it's our fault for consenting all along. And I just think that's really, really broken. DAVIES: You know, it's - one of the interesting things is that Apple has for its apps a privacy label, kind of like the nutrition labels that you see on foods, which are supposed to tell you quickly and clearly what the - you know, the nutritional content is. These labels are supposed to tell you what this particular app's privacy policies are. You took a closer look at this. What did you find? FOWLER: I found that they were pretty lacking. First of all, I'm a professional. It's my job to be paid to read privacy policies and to understand these things. I look at Apple's labels and I'm still not entirely certain what I'm learning from them. It's not really giving me the information that I want to know, which is, like, well, who's getting my data? It doesn't say that. It doesn't give me any power, really, to stop them from collecting some of these things, you know, beyond pressing that ask app not to track button, which, again, is more of kind of a request. And most puzzling of all, the labels aren't necessarily even accurate. When they first came out, I just tested a whole bunch of them and then, you know, looked behind the curtain to see what data the apps were collecting. And I found plenty were, you know, fibbing in these labels. They were saying that there was no data collected when, in fact, there was plenty of data being collected. And when I confronted Apple about this, they said, oh, well, these are self-reported (laughter). So you know, if we find someone is breaking the rules, we might do something about it. But thanks for pointing out some that might be breaking the rules. And good golly, you know, if me, one journalist sitting in San Francisco, can spot all of this, how can a how-many-trillion-dollar corporation - why can't it take on this responsibility? So there's a theme that's been coming up in our conversation today so far, and that is responsibility of giant tech corporations. And they certainly want to make a lot of money and become, you know, the most powerful and wealthy companies in history. But when it comes to protecting consumers, they really are not getting the job done entirely. And that's one of the things that most galls me as a consumer advocate and as a technology journalist, that if you're going to make that much money off of us, you really got to live up to your promises. DAVIES: Yeah. One of the most striking things when you describe these labels, these privacy labels that are supposed to tell you quickly what the app does in terms of privacy, there's a little phrase that says, this information has not been verified by Apple. So huh (laughter)? FOWLER: I mean, would you buy a loaf of bread from the store if the nutrition label at the back said, like, might be accurate, might not be? I mean, we just wouldn't let that go. But again, this is an industry that is, for the most part, completely unregulated in the U. S. and, not only that, also has no competition. You know, Apple and Google have a stranglehold over the app stores that we use for iPhones and Android phones. They are a huge - you know, almost the entire market for app stores. So it's not like I could go and say, you know what? I'm going to choose the app store that's made by Mozilla, which is a nonprofit which is really committed to consumer privacy. I would love a Mozilla-made app store for my iPhone or Android phone. That feels like that would really empower me because I trust them more than, frankly, I trust Apple or Google. DAVIES: This area of privacy policies is one in which you, again, have some ideas about what we should do. And you write that we should abolish the notion that we should read privacy policies. What's the alternative? FOWLER: Yeah. Well, at the highest level, we just need a better rule for what can happen with our data. There's been, you know, decades of discussion about a federal privacy law in the U. S. And states like California have tried their own. You know, there's renewed discussion about it as of even the last couple of weeks about how we might get a law that would cover everything. But there's a basic premise here that, I think, really ought to be at the core of everything, and that is only take as much data as you need to do the thing that I asked you to do, no more, no less. Then we would have much fewer problems. The thing is, I think that's what most consumers already assume is happening, that if you ask, you know, a website to show you a map, it's collecting your location just for that moment to give you directions, and that's it. The problem is that's not what's happening. These companies are taking it as an opportunity to then collect your data all the time or, you know - and do what they want to with it. And so that's the fundamental disconnect. So we need a new notion of what the base level of privacy is so it's kind of built in by default. Now, there's discussion, again, about making a federal privacy law that might do that. If they don't, you know, the FTC has some new leadership under the Biden administration. And I've spoken with some commissioners there. And they seem like they're ready to be much more aggressive, even with our existing laws, of enforcing some of these kinds of ideas that it is a failure of trust to the consumer to take more data than you really need in that moment. So they haven't done a ton with it yet, but I'm really curious to see where that goes. DAVIES: And by the way, when you see this little question on the - on your app that says, read our privacy policy - do you accept? - if you don't accept it, does that mean you don't get to use the app? FOWLER: Yeah. DAVIES: That's it (laughter). There's. . . FOWLER: You don't have much choice. I mean, that's one of sort of the critical elements here is that the - we're getting this idea that somehow we are making a choice to accept these. But it's not like you can negotiate with these things. You can't go in and say, OK, I like paragraph 13 but not paragraph 17, so let's strike that one out. It's an all or nothing. So, you know, you could say, OK, fine, just don't use these apps. And increasingly, people are making that choice about things like Facebook or Instagram or maybe even Google products or Amazon products. But it is increasingly hard to be a connected person in our society without, you know, agreeing to these things. You know, if you're a student in school, you've got to use Google's software for schoolwork. If you - you know, many people have to use stuff for work. So it's just - again, putting the onus on us, the consumer, to, like, read each of these things and and make that choice is just too much. DAVIES: Let me reintroduce you. We need to take a break here. We're speaking with Geoffrey Fowler. He's a technology columnist for The Washington Post based in San Francisco. We'll continue our conversation in just a moment. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF GEORGE FENTON'S \"THE NEW VAN\")DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. And we're speaking with Geoffrey Fowler. He's a technology columnist for The Washington Post. He writes about consumer advice on navigating the tech world. He has an ongoing series about privacy and other information issues with our apps and smartphones. It's titled \"We The Users. \"Another thing you write in terms of, you know, another way to do things is you say we could make our computers privacy butlers, meaning what? FOWLER: This is actually one of the most exciting ideas to me because, you know, we're all very aware that technology can be used to invade our privacy. But what if technology could be used to help protect our privacy? And the way this might work is if privacy policies started being written in a standardized format - so maybe something closer to labels, but let's, have a standardized kind of way to do it, standardized way to disclose information. But instead of assuming that consumers are going to read all of those, if we tag them, then computers could read them, and they could know what kinds of things are happening. They could tell, aha, OK, this website has targeted ads on it. This website is collecting your location, will send it to the following data brokers or other kinds of people that you don't necessarily want with your data. Then your computer, in the form of your phone or in the form of a web browser, could interact with each of those tagged privacy policies for you and know your preferences like a butler, know that, OK, Geoff does not like websites with targeted ads or Geoff, you know, doesn't want his information sent to certain data brokers and then make those choices for you so you didn't have to read them. DAVIES: So for that to happen, the computers or smartphone makers would have to decide to do this, and then the app makers would have to cooperate or we could have a law. FOWLER: Or we could have a law that is required. There actually was a law put forward - a bill put forward earlier this year called the Too Long; Didn't Read Act, the TL;DR Act. And part of it was that privacy policies would have to be written in a readable format and that they would have to be tagged. And if we could get those kind of elements put in place and we started tagging them, then we could develop the systems and the technology to interact with them for us. But, you know, there's already sort of hints that this is possible and is going on. So in California, where I'm based, we have a law that says that, you know, you as a consumer can always tell a company, don't sell my data. The problem is that right now, it's really hard to tell all the companies that you interact with not to sell your data. So there's an effort - a technological effort underway to build into browsers something called the Global Privacy Control that would send a signal out to every website you go to that says, hey, don't - I'm a California resident. By law, you're not allowed to collect my data if I tell you not to and sell it. So don't do it. And that's just getting off the ground. And it, you know, will require some enforcement by the state of California. But that's the kind of idea that I find really intriguing. DAVIES: You know, you recently wrote about the form that you often sign when you go into a doctor's office. You know, we were talking about privacy policies. You know, you're confronted with this long block of text and then you say, yes, I agree. You looked into what you might be authorizing in terms of use of your medical data. What did you find? FOWLER: You might be authorizing a company that you've never heard of to take your medical information and use it to market to you very specific pharmaceuticals. DAVIES: Wow. I mean, like, how does that work? FOWLER: I heard about this happening actually from a number of Washington Post readers who wrote to me about seeing something kind of curious when they were filling out their forms that they got asked to sign when they went to the doctor's office. And they pointed me that there was this company called Phreesia - that's Phreesia with a P-H - that was making the software that they were using to check in at their doctor's office. So you might have gotten this from a doctor that asks you to e-check in maybe the day before. Or when you arrive at the doctor's office, they hand you a tablet, and they say, OK, you know, fill in all this information here. And it's - a lot of it's the typical kinds of stuff. It's like, give me your name and your address and demographic information and what medications you're on and your previous history of ailments and all that kind of stuff. But there was one more form in the stack that said at the bottom, I agree. And the wall of text in it said, I agree to allow Phreesia to use the information that I just entered to show me very targeted marketing information based on my health care status. DAVIES: So let's understand this. I mean, is this the case of the medical practice deciding it's going to ask you to essentially waive the HIPAA right to privacy and allow the medical practice to sell the data? Or is it the party that does this? I mean, how does this work? FOWLER: Yeah. So the way HIPAA works is it applies to what are known as covered entities. So in this instance, your doctor is a covered entity, so your doctor is not allowed to share your health information without your permission. And there's all sorts of rules about how they must protect it and all kinds of stuff. But your doctor's office has contracted out to this company called Phreesia to make the software that is used for patient intake. So they - you know, they pay a fee to this Phreesia company to help them run the front office of their clinic, which I completely get. You know, doctors' offices are totally slammed. They have to collect all this information. This seems like a good deal. The thing is, Phreesia has this side business in marketing and targeted ads, and the folks who made the decision for your doctor's office or clinic to go with them may or may not even totally realize that that's happening. And under HIPAA, Phreesia is a business associate of the covered entity, which means that it is automatically allowed to have access to all of the data that you are sharing with your doctor for your care. But it is allowed if it gets you to click a button that says, I agree to use that data in other kinds of ways. And so we've developed all of these secondary uses of data. Some of them are arguably pretty good for our society. We get to know, for example, the COVID case rates, you know, that kind of information. It becomes much more accessible much more quickly. But businesses now have come along and decided that they want to come up with some secondary uses of the data. And this is one of them - Phreesia taking your health information and basically mining it, trying to figure out, OK, do we know who you are? Do you have some ailments that we have advertisers that they want to address? Or might you - future - you know, have some ailments you didn't even know about that we could make you aware of so that you'll go into the doctor's office in just a moment and ask your doctor about them? DAVIES: So you contacted this company that does this, Phreesia. What did they tell you? FOWLER: Phreesia says they do not sell our health information. This is actually really similar to an argument I often hear from Google and Facebook, which also do not technically sell your data to other companies. Instead, they mine your data and use it to target you with ads in a place where they've got your attention. In the case of Phreesia, the place they've got your attention is you're at the doctor's office. You just filled out information on a tablet given to you by the doctor, and you're waiting to see the doctor. And so they've got that screen in front of you, and that's where they're going to show you these ads, at that moment. In the case of Facebook and Google, it's when you're using their services. So it's a subtle, legal distinction, but practically, you know, for consumers, it doesn't make any difference. The pharmaceutical company may not know - may not actually have your medical record, but it's still able to use it to target you with messages about its products at the at the moment when they know you're most susceptible to them. DAVIES: And when you say you get the ads on the screen, you don't mean the tablet screen that has the text and the permission for them. You mean your smartphone if you're in the doctor's office? FOWLER: I mean literally on the tablet screen - yeah - that they handed you. DAVIES: Oh, really? So if I tell them I have high blood pressure, I'm going to get an ad for high blood pressure medication? FOWLER: You might. You might very well. Or they might try to use some kind of algorithm to decide, all right, Dave, you look like - you know, demographically and other ways, you look like someone who might have hidden high blood pressure. So let's plant that idea in your brain so you go in and you tell your doctor, hey, might I have high blood pressure? Do I need a medication for that? So that's the marketing game that they're playing. FOWLER: Let me reintroduce you again. We're going to take another break. We are speaking with Geoffrey Fowler. He's a technology columnist for The Washington Post. We'll continue our conversation after this short break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF JOSHUA REDMAN'S \"HIT THE ROAD JACK\")DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR, and we're speaking with Geoffrey Fowler. He's a technology columnist for The Washington Post based in San Francisco. He has a new series, an ongoing series, about privacy and other information issues with our apps and smartphones titled \"We The Users,\" which points out issues and offers some solutions. You know, our phones store so much information about us. And one thing you recently wrote about is the prospect that if the Supreme Court overturns the Roe v. Wade decision and abortion becomes a crime in some states, that law enforcement or others might get phone data to investigate who has sought or gotten or provided an illegal abortion. What could happen here? FOWLER: Your phone knows a lot about you, and so it would know if you were searching for information about where to get an abortion. It might know if you were at a clinic. It might know the history of your fertility cycle because a lot of people use cycle tracking apps. All of this data could be used against you if you happen to be in a state where seeking an abortion becomes against the law. There is some precedent for this already, that search histories and other information has been used to try to show that women were guilty of not caring for their fetuses or leading to the death of a baby. And the thing that I think people forget is any time that a company collects information about you, the government can get access to that information either by issuing a court order or increasingly, just by buying it. Right? We're talking about a giant industry economy of selling people's data. So increasingly, we are seeing government go and do that to gather evidence and to try to prosecute crimes. DAVIES: And could private actors do this, too? I mean, the Texas law, for example, offers essentially a financial incentive for a private citizen to find someone who's violated the abortion statutes. FOWLER: Indeed, a private actor could do this. And, in fact, the day after the leaked Roe v. Wade decision became news, some technology journalists went and bought a bunch of data from a location data broker where they were able to identify people who were at abortion clinics and where they were before they were at the clinic and then where they went afterwards. So even journalists are able to do this stuff. So, you know, folks who really want to make use of this kind of data certainly could. Another example of how data collected by companies can be used in unexpected ways is that recently a Catholic news organization got access to some data that indicated that a well-known priest was gay. And they did this by buying the data that they linked to the gay dating app Grindr and were able to track the location of one user from the known address of this priest and his known whereabouts to gay clubs and other sorts of places. And this priest had to end up resigning because of this. So, again, this is all done through private industry. DAVIES: So the journalist did a story of effectively outing this priest? FOWLER: Yeah. You know, and what these examples remind me is that digital rights are civil rights, you know, and these things are increasingly linked together. And that's why I think it's so important that we talk about what's being collected and what kind of control and power we have over it Because, you know, you can't tease them apart anymore. DAVIES: You know, on the issue of information about abortion, I was stunned to read something in one of your stories that you linked to another article showing that an anti-abortion group had gotten smartphone data to then target anti-abortion messages to the phones of patients in the waiting rooms of an abortion provider. This is pretty remarkable. How did this happen? FOWLER: Yeah, this happened, I believe, in Massachusetts, where as part of this targeted ad industry, you can target people in specific places. And so they did that with messages to people that they thought were in abortion clinics. I think Massachusetts has since made that illegal to do. But still, they showed that it is possible. So, you know, when we think that, oh, there's no real harm in, you know, allowing apps to collect our data or maybe even in seeing, you know, being targeted with ads in these kind of very ultra-specific kinds of ways, it can be hard to see in the future how this stuff might be used against us. But we're starting to get examples like this. DAVIES: You know, we began the conversation talking about kind of a comparison to the writing of the U. S. Constitution. And at a time in the late 18th century, when the country was governed by the Articles of Confederation, and they were outdated, and they didn't work, and we're now in a technology world where things need to change - what are the prospects for good legislation getting through Congress, do you think? FOWLER: They're better than they've ever been. So that's the positive sign. Right now, you know, there's new discussion about a privacy law in Washington. There's also discussion about several bills that would introduce more competition into the digital marketplaces, which I think would really make a big impact because that way, you know, companies would be forced to compete on privacy, forced to compete on having a well-run app store, forced to compete on, you know, the quality of search results and other sorts of things. So, you know, some of this is going to be hashed out this summer. And the bad news is - the thinking is that if some of this stuff doesn't pass in the next couple of months, it's going to be a long time, given the distractions of the midterm elections and the potential that the Democrats are going to lose control of Congress. So there's a lot of focus on this right now. DAVIES: OK. I'll just close by noting that Geoffrey Fowler's work is available online. It includes a lot of interesting links and videos that he does to explain a lot of this in simple terms. So, Geoffrey Fowler, thanks so much for speaking with us again. FOWLER: Thanks for having me.

I'm Dave Davies, in for Terry Gross, who's off this week. Our guest, Geoffrey Fowler, is a technology columnist for The Washington Post who has a habit of revealing things about our computers and smartphones that make us squirm. He writes in a recent column, for example, that apps are spying on our kids on a scale that will shock you. That's from an ongoing series Fowler publishes titled \"We The Users,\" which details the ways our phones and apps harvest our personal data, manipulate information we see and limit our choices. He says changes are needed in our laws and corporate practices governing the internet, and he presents some ideas in the series. He's also written recently about concerns that information stored in smartphones could be used to investigate those seeking abortions, should they become illegal in some states. Geoffrey Fowler writes about technology issues from San Francisco. He worked for The Wall Street Journal before coming to The Washington Post in 2017. Geoffrey Fowler, welcome back to FRESH AIR. GEOFFREY FOWLER: Thanks for having me. DAVIES: So, Geoffrey, the title of this series is \"We The Users. \" You want to explain the expression, what you're getting at here? FOWLER: Well, with apologies to James Madison, who wrote the Constitution, I felt like we needed to have that same kind of spirit to look at what's going on with the technology in our lives today. You know, I've been a technology journalist for a long time, and originally I was a reviewer of technology. That means that my job was to, you know, check out the new gadget and tell you, is it worth it? You know, is the price right? Does it work well enough, or is it easy to use? But the longer I do this, the more I realize that that frame is not what we really need anymore. We need to really challenge the technology companies and the world that they've built for us in a different frame. It's no longer a question of, is it too hard to use? The question now has become, is it evil? Is it taking away our rights and our choices? You know, living with technology is not just for geeks anymore. It's an intersectional issue. And I realize that we use technology not just as geeks and nerds, but now as everyday consumers, as parents, as patients, as employees in all sorts of different hats. And so I wanted to sort of look at the products and technologies that we use every day with that sort of hat on. DAVIES: All right. Let's talk about some of the specific issues that you identify. You write that if there were a van outside your children's bedroom window spying on them, you'd call the police. But you say our apps are doing this all the time, on a scale that would shock us. What are they doing, exactly? FOWLER: Apps that your kids are using are spying on them at just an extraordinary scale. So I work with some researchers at a company called Pixalate, and they looked at this question on a really broad scale. So they tried to categorize all of the apps that exist that might be appealing to kids, and then they tracked what happened to the personal data that those apps were collecting - things like ways to identify the phone, the location of the phone. And they found that more than two-thirds of them, on iPhones, were sending this information off to the advertising industry. It was even higher number, 79%, on Android phones. And what shocked me about this is that we have a law in America that's supposed to protect the privacy of children. And yet, this is happening. DAVIES: Right. And so it sends - they can figure out where the kids are, their ages, all of that. What's the harm? How might this be used in ways that should concern us? FOWLER: Yeah, there's an ongoing discussion about the harms that can come from collecting people's data broadly, and we can talk about some of those for all people, not just children. But specifically with children, we've sort of decided as a society that children are special. They are supposed to be protected because they can't necessarily, you know, make the best choices for themselves. They don't really know what they're giving up. They're not really making a concerted, you know, decision to hand over this information. They just want to play, you know, the game where they get to shoot birds or crush candy or whatever it might be. But specifically with kids, research has suggested that lots of children aren't able to distinguish ads from content, which means that when a company can track their every interest, they can really target them with messages that could harm them - could not only sell them stuff, but could shape their self-esteem, shape their view of their bodies. And we learned last fall, from the disclosures that were leaked out of Facebook, that things like social media, where kids' own data is used to shape the experience that they have there, can contribute to eating disorders. So we know that kids, their data in particular, deserves special protection. DAVIES: So if I have a 8- or 9-year-old kid, what might happen that could affect them in a way that should concern us? FOWLER: So companies out there that you would never know the name of, that really have no, even, relationship with the app that you were trying to use, could be, first of all, tracking your kid's interests, then trying to predict what they might want to buy, even then, or sell their information on to others. There's an entire, you know, multibillion-dollar ecosystem of collecting this information and then repackaging it and selling it to others and then selling it to others yet again, all of which you don't really have any control over. I mean, one just sort of shocking stat I came across in reporting this is by the time a child reaches 13, online advertising firms hold an average of 72 million data points about kids. That's according to this company that, you know, helps companies market to children ethically. DAVIES: That's 72 million about a kid? FOWLER: Correct. Every single kid. DAVIES: Wow (laughter). I don't know how there could be 72 million data points about anybody. FOWLER: It's true. Well, you know, think about every location you go, every IP address, you know, how you use different apps in different ways. I mean, the thing about data is, in the moment, it always seems like, oh, well, that's no big deal. But when you step away from it and you realize that once it's collected, it's out of your control, it could be used in all kinds of ways that we can't even imagine yet. And yet we keep getting reminders that it can come back, and it doesn't ever necessarily go away and can be used to hurt people, that we would look back and say, gosh, we just shouldn't have done that. DAVIES: So, for example, would you have - might you have games marketed to kids with violent or other disturbing content? FOWLER: The issue here is less about content. Apps in both the Google and Android app stores all have to have an age rating on them, which is for, you know - about, you know, how violent the content is or how adult it might be in nature. So you'll see those ratings in the store. The problem here is that those ratings have nothing to do with whether or not those apps are collecting data about children. And the law that we have in the United States called COPPA, the Children's Online Protection Act, says that, pretty clearly, if someone is under 13, companies are not supposed to collect data about them without their parent's explicit permission. But the problem is that this giant industry of app developers and also Apple and Google, who run these app stores and make billions of dollars off of it, have found some really big loopholes in that law, so they're doing it anyway. DAVIES: Let's talk about that. There is a law, the 1998 Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, that requires tech companies to protect the privacy of kids. Why doesn't it? What are the loopholes? FOWLER: The loophole is, in the law, a company has to have actual knowledge that a child is using the app or website in order for the law to kick in. That means that they have to - you know, an app developer has to know, oh, yes, there is a 12-year-old on my app right now, for them to be forced to say, OK, well, I guess I won't collect data in this instance. I guess I won't send their information off to advertisers. So many of them then just claim, oh, we don't know who's using our app. It could be adults. Or they'll say, you know, we're really not marketing this coloring app or this math homework assistance app to children. We're marketing it to adults. And Apple and Google, who run these app stores and are sort of the de facto police for them, let them get away with it. DAVIES: Right. So - and when you looked at this and others looked at this, what did they learn about apps that presumably are for adults and the extent to which kids use them? FOWLER: Kids use all kinds of things. I mean, the app stores that they have available to them on their phones are just the same as the app stores that adults have. So they want to play the same games that we want to play oftentimes. That's things like Angry Birds and Candy Crush. They want to use calculator apps. They want to do coloring apps where they, you know, tap on pixels to - for enjoyment. They want to do a lot of the same things we do. And these kinds of apps are all claiming that they are general audience apps, which means that they are made for adults, rather than acknowledging that, you know, actually, kids are going to be interested in this stuff, too, so you ought to treat them differently. DAVIES: You found some apps that were clearly designed for kids, but the app developer says it's for ages 12 and over. Can you give us an example of something you found? FOWLER: Yeah, there was one app that's used for coloring. It's called Pixel Art, and you spend your time tapping on pixels to fill in the colors on, you know, pre-made pictures of things like ice cream or unicorns or fancy unicorns. And the developer of that app told me, oh, but we're a coloring app for adults. Now, look, I know there has been, like, a trend in adults coloring on apps as a stress relief, and I 100% get that. But America's child privacy law, COPPA, says that if the product is supposed to be used in any way by children, any part of the audience is children, then the app developer really needs to comply with COPPA. And so they ought to then be checking to see, OK, are you a kid who's here for the coloring app? And if so, don't collect their data, or then, get their parents' permission. DAVIES: So what's the fix here? FOWLER: There's a couple of fixes here. First of all, Apple and Google are the de facto cops for apps in our world. You know, they get to decide what goes in those stores, and they actually go to Washington all the time right now arguing that they alone should be allowed to run these stores, even though they are kind of like monopolies, because they alone can protect our privacy and our security and protect our kids. So if they're going to say that, then they really ought to force apps to tell the truth about whether children are potentially using the apps, and if so, treat them differently. Right now, they kind of turn the other way when apps say, oh, no, no, we're just marketing this coloring app for adults. And so they should force every app to identify whether it is in any way directed at children. And if the apps lie when they submit themselves to the store, the app stores should punish them. So that's one basic step. You know, the FTC actually asked Apple and Google to do this a decade ago, but they did not because they realized that that would put a lot more work and - you know, on their shoulders, to have to kind of make those distinctions, make those decisions. But somebody has got to make these decisions, and the app makers themselves aren't doing it. So I think Apple and Google ought to take on that work. DAVIES: Right, just on this point. So if there's a way to actually discover whether an app is being used by kids, what should happen? The app-maker then should be - should itself ensure that it harvests no personal information and gives it to the advertising industry? FOWLER: That's right. This part of the COPPA law is already super clear. It says that, you know, if a kid is using the app, you either have to not collect personal information, which is always an option for apps and websites out there. They could just stop collecting all of our data. Or they have to get explicit parental permission. So they - you know, they ask, OK, can you please ask mom or dad to verify that you're using this? And they might ask mom or dad a question that only a mom or a dad would know the answer to. DAVIES: OK. And other ideas? FOWLER: Another idea that came from, of all places, Instagram, which is one of the apps that we've been talking a lot about as causing problems for kids, is to have the phone itself know whether or not a kid is using it. So the idea is when a parent sets up an iPhone or an Android phone for their child, they enter in the age of the child. And so if that age is under 13, then it would send a signal out to apps that would say, hey, there is a kid here. Do not collect data unless you get parental permission. I think that would be really useful in a lot of different ways. You know, No. 1, apps could build this into their systems so that, you know, it would be automatic, and they wouldn't collect the data. Hey, many app developers tell me they don't want to be collecting kids' data, but it's hard for them to know. And so this would give them a hand but also just give this - them information about who's using their app so that they could understand, actually, we really are child-directed, and we need to think about that as we - so we develop this further. DAVIES: Let me reintroduce you. We need to take a break here. We're speaking with Geoffrey Fowler. He's a technology columnist for The Washington Post based in San Francisco. We'll continue our conversation in just a moment. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF TODD SICKAFOOSE'S \"TINY RESISTORS\") DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR, and we're speaking with Geoffrey Fowler. He's a technology columnist for The Washington Post. He writes about consumer advice on navigating the tech world. He has an ongoing series about privacy and other information issues with our apps and smartphones. It's titled \"We The Users. \" You know, a while back, Apple began giving users of iPhones the option of telling them, I don't want this app to track my data. And it was kind of a cool thing. And I think a lot of people felt reassured, and it gave them some real options. In an article - I think this was last fall - you looked into this and found apps don't exactly do that, right? What did you find? FOWLER: You're exactly right. So we've all now seen this TV commercial, or there's actually several of them for Apple, where, you know, something really creepy starts happening to someone who's using a phone. Maybe they start being followed around by a bunch of people. Or there's another one that's on right now where there's an auction going on. They're auctioning off people's data. And the solution to these problems in these commercials is that you press a button on your iPhone that says ask app not to track, and then magically, poof, all the bad guys go away. So this is really intriguing. This is the sort of solution that people want. And it fits in the Apple brand of, hey, we're going to protect people's privacy. So - but I was really curious. What does happen when you press the button? Does it stop all of this tracking and data collection that apps are doing kind of behind the scenes? And the short answer is it stops some of it. It stops one form of it. But it certainly does not stop it all. DAVIES: So what does go on? FOWLER: So when you press the ask-app-not-to-track button, first of all, it's kind of encoded in the language that Apple uses there. You're putting in a request not to track you, but you're not exactly shutting off the system - so that would be used to potentially track you. So what you're doing is you're stopping the app from using one particular kind of ID that exists on your phone. It's called the IDFA. And it was actually made by Apple, built into the iPhone a long time ago. And it's just a code that allows apps to know who you are across different apps. That's really helpful for advertisers, for example, who might want to show you the same ad for fancy underwear that you see in one app and then, you know, show it to you on another website or in another app. So when you press the ask-app-not-to-track button, it says you can't grab that form of ID anymore. But it doesn't really do anything to stop all of the other kinds of data that can still be used to identify you that apps might want to grab. We did a little test. We tested an app called Subway Surfers, which is one of the most popular games for the iPhone. And we said - we tested, OK, what happens when we press this button? And when we did, we watched it still grab 29 other very specific data points about your phone, including your internet address, the free storage on your phone, the current volume level of your phone and even the battery level on your phone. What is it doing with all this information? Well, these kinds of details allow the app to make what's called a fingerprint of your phone. Basically, it's an alternative way to identify you. And then that basically lets the app track who you are and then send that information out so it can be used to track you across lots of different apps. DAVIES: Right. So the app developer itself has to affirmatively decide, I'm not going to market this stuff, I'm not going to collect this stuff and market it. And a lot of them just aren't doing that, right? They're kind of taking a back door and getting information that's valuable and selling it? FOWLER: That's right. The way this happens is it's a little - it's often a little less direct in the intention of the app developer. We've developed this giant economy of apps, you know, billions and billions of dollars where the way - the easiest way to make money as a developer is to include this software. They're called SDK, software development kits, that they just plug in to the app that will promise to, like, help them make money. Many of them have to do with advertising. And the app developer itself may not even know what exactly it's doing. But oftentimes, it's these SDKs that are grabbing all of these details to try to better target ads. And, you know, the more data they grab, the more they can sell those ads for. DAVIES: So an effective practice to really prevent tracking, I guess, would be they would have to do some of the analytics that you and others did to determine whether apps are taking other indicators of identity and selling them, and then those that violate it - what? - toss them off the app, fine them? I mean, it's hard to do that for tens of thousands of apps, right? FOWLER: You're right. Apple and Google would have to - because they run these app stores would have to take responsibility for it. And they would have to investigate each app. They would have to test each new version of it to make sure that they're not getting up to anything creepy. And if they break those rules, they would have to boot them out of the store. It might sound like a lot of work. And yet Apple already claims it does this, right? It has this entire App Store review process, which it says, you know, is critical to the trust that we have in the iPhone and making it a private service and making it private and secure. So they just ought to complete the job is what I say. DAVIES: All right. In the meantime, you check that button, don't allow this app to track my stuff? FOWLER: It's better than nothing. So, yeah, take advantage of everything you can out there because it's, you know, it's a battle. DAVIES: We need to take another break here. Let me reintroduce you. Geoffrey Fowler is the technology columnist for The Washington Post, based in San Francisco. His ongoing series of articles about issues with our computers and smartphones is titled \"We The Users. \" He'll be back to talk more after this short break. I'm Dave Davies, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies, in for Terry Gross, who's off this week. We're speaking with Geoffrey Fowler. He writes about technology for The Washington Post from San Francisco, often giving consumer advice on navigating the tech world. He has an ongoing series about privacy and other information issues with our apps and smartphones titled \"We The Users. \" You write about privacy policies. I mean, we are all used to, at this point, being confronted with a long block of text saying, these are our terms of service. Do you agree? And because we want to go on to the next step, we just simply click, I agree. You know, I do this all the time. I never read that stuff. In fact, one of the most shocking things about your article about this was that a Pew study showed that 9% of users actually do read these privacy agreements. I would have thought it would've been none. FOWLER: I think they - maybe they were lying. DAVIES: (Laughter) Right, right - I read one once. For an example of the scale of this, I mean, you totaled up the length of the privacy policies that one might read just for the apps on your phone. How long were they? FOWLER: It was a million words. And just to give you a little context, that's about twice the length of \"War And Peace. \" There is no way that any normal-functioning person is going to have time enough to read that even once, much less keep reading it as these companies tweak the language and update them, you know, all the time. It's just nuts. But unfortunately, it is the basis of how our privacy is supposed to be protected in the U. S. Our problem right now is that we're just overwhelmed by data collection. And this model that's built into American law and the economy that we, the users, are somehow consenting to each and every one of these data uses is completely broken. In fact, it's really mean to us as consumers. It's not really fair. It puts the onus on us, puts on our shoulders that if something happens with our data that we didn't like or something bad happens to our data, it's our fault for consenting all along. And I just think that's really, really broken. DAVIES: You know, it's - one of the interesting things is that Apple has for its apps a privacy label, kind of like the nutrition labels that you see on foods, which are supposed to tell you quickly and clearly what the - you know, the nutritional content is. These labels are supposed to tell you what this particular app's privacy policies are. You took a closer look at this. What did you find? FOWLER: I found that they were pretty lacking. First of all, I'm a professional. It's my job to be paid to read privacy policies and to understand these things. I look at Apple's labels and I'm still not entirely certain what I'm learning from them. It's not really giving me the information that I want to know, which is, like, well, who's getting my data? It doesn't say that. It doesn't give me any power, really, to stop them from collecting some of these things, you know, beyond pressing that ask app not to track button, which, again, is more of kind of a request. And most puzzling of all, the labels aren't necessarily even accurate. When they first came out, I just tested a whole bunch of them and then, you know, looked behind the curtain to see what data the apps were collecting. And I found plenty were, you know, fibbing in these labels. They were saying that there was no data collected when, in fact, there was plenty of data being collected. And when I confronted Apple about this, they said, oh, well, these are self-reported (laughter). So you know, if we find someone is breaking the rules, we might do something about it. But thanks for pointing out some that might be breaking the rules. And good golly, you know, if me, one journalist sitting in San Francisco, can spot all of this, how can a how-many-trillion-dollar corporation - why can't it take on this responsibility? So there's a theme that's been coming up in our conversation today so far, and that is responsibility of giant tech corporations. And they certainly want to make a lot of money and become, you know, the most powerful and wealthy companies in history. But when it comes to protecting consumers, they really are not getting the job done entirely. And that's one of the things that most galls me as a consumer advocate and as a technology journalist, that if you're going to make that much money off of us, you really got to live up to your promises. DAVIES: Yeah. One of the most striking things when you describe these labels, these privacy labels that are supposed to tell you quickly what the app does in terms of privacy, there's a little phrase that says, this information has not been verified by Apple. So huh (laughter)? FOWLER: I mean, would you buy a loaf of bread from the store if the nutrition label at the back said, like, might be accurate, might not be? I mean, we just wouldn't let that go. But again, this is an industry that is, for the most part, completely unregulated in the U. S. and, not only that, also has no competition. You know, Apple and Google have a stranglehold over the app stores that we use for iPhones and Android phones. They are a huge - you know, almost the entire market for app stores. So it's not like I could go and say, you know what? I'm going to choose the app store that's made by Mozilla, which is a nonprofit which is really committed to consumer privacy. I would love a Mozilla-made app store for my iPhone or Android phone. That feels like that would really empower me because I trust them more than, frankly, I trust Apple or Google. DAVIES: This area of privacy policies is one in which you, again, have some ideas about what we should do. And you write that we should abolish the notion that we should read privacy policies. What's the alternative? FOWLER: Yeah. Well, at the highest level, we just need a better rule for what can happen with our data. There's been, you know, decades of discussion about a federal privacy law in the U. S. And states like California have tried their own. You know, there's renewed discussion about it as of even the last couple of weeks about how we might get a law that would cover everything. But there's a basic premise here that, I think, really ought to be at the core of everything, and that is only take as much data as you need to do the thing that I asked you to do, no more, no less. Then we would have much fewer problems. The thing is, I think that's what most consumers already assume is happening, that if you ask, you know, a website to show you a map, it's collecting your location just for that moment to give you directions, and that's it. The problem is that's not what's happening. These companies are taking it as an opportunity to then collect your data all the time or, you know - and do what they want to with it. And so that's the fundamental disconnect. So we need a new notion of what the base level of privacy is so it's kind of built in by default. Now, there's discussion, again, about making a federal privacy law that might do that. If they don't, you know, the FTC has some new leadership under the Biden administration. And I've spoken with some commissioners there. And they seem like they're ready to be much more aggressive, even with our existing laws, of enforcing some of these kinds of ideas that it is a failure of trust to the consumer to take more data than you really need in that moment. So they haven't done a ton with it yet, but I'm really curious to see where that goes. DAVIES: And by the way, when you see this little question on the - on your app that says, read our privacy policy - do you accept? - if you don't accept it, does that mean you don't get to use the app? FOWLER: Yeah. DAVIES: That's it (laughter). There's. . . FOWLER: You don't have much choice. I mean, that's one of sort of the critical elements here is that the - we're getting this idea that somehow we are making a choice to accept these. But it's not like you can negotiate with these things. You can't go in and say, OK, I like paragraph 13 but not paragraph 17, so let's strike that one out. It's an all or nothing. So, you know, you could say, OK, fine, just don't use these apps. And increasingly, people are making that choice about things like Facebook or Instagram or maybe even Google products or Amazon products. But it is increasingly hard to be a connected person in our society without, you know, agreeing to these things. You know, if you're a student in school, you've got to use Google's software for schoolwork. If you - you know, many people have to use stuff for work. So it's just - again, putting the onus on us, the consumer, to, like, read each of these things and and make that choice is just too much. DAVIES: Let me reintroduce you. We need to take a break here. We're speaking with Geoffrey Fowler. He's a technology columnist for The Washington Post based in San Francisco. We'll continue our conversation in just a moment. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF GEORGE FENTON'S \"THE NEW VAN\") DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. And we're speaking with Geoffrey Fowler. He's a technology columnist for The Washington Post. He writes about consumer advice on navigating the tech world. He has an ongoing series about privacy and other information issues with our apps and smartphones. It's titled \"We The Users. \" Another thing you write in terms of, you know, another way to do things is you say we could make our computers privacy butlers, meaning what? FOWLER: This is actually one of the most exciting ideas to me because, you know, we're all very aware that technology can be used to invade our privacy. But what if technology could be used to help protect our privacy? And the way this might work is if privacy policies started being written in a standardized format - so maybe something closer to labels, but let's, have a standardized kind of way to do it, standardized way to disclose information. But instead of assuming that consumers are going to read all of those, if we tag them, then computers could read them, and they could know what kinds of things are happening. They could tell, aha, OK, this website has targeted ads on it. This website is collecting your location, will send it to the following data brokers or other kinds of people that you don't necessarily want with your data. Then your computer, in the form of your phone or in the form of a web browser, could interact with each of those tagged privacy policies for you and know your preferences like a butler, know that, OK, Geoff does not like websites with targeted ads or Geoff, you know, doesn't want his information sent to certain data brokers and then make those choices for you so you didn't have to read them. DAVIES: So for that to happen, the computers or smartphone makers would have to decide to do this, and then the app makers would have to cooperate or we could have a law. FOWLER: Or we could have a law that is required. There actually was a law put forward - a bill put forward earlier this year called the Too Long; Didn't Read Act, the TL;DR Act. And part of it was that privacy policies would have to be written in a readable format and that they would have to be tagged. And if we could get those kind of elements put in place and we started tagging them, then we could develop the systems and the technology to interact with them for us. But, you know, there's already sort of hints that this is possible and is going on. So in California, where I'm based, we have a law that says that, you know, you as a consumer can always tell a company, don't sell my data. The problem is that right now, it's really hard to tell all the companies that you interact with not to sell your data. So there's an effort - a technological effort underway to build into browsers something called the Global Privacy Control that would send a signal out to every website you go to that says, hey, don't - I'm a California resident. By law, you're not allowed to collect my data if I tell you not to and sell it. So don't do it. And that's just getting off the ground. And it, you know, will require some enforcement by the state of California. But that's the kind of idea that I find really intriguing. DAVIES: You know, you recently wrote about the form that you often sign when you go into a doctor's office. You know, we were talking about privacy policies. You know, you're confronted with this long block of text and then you say, yes, I agree. You looked into what you might be authorizing in terms of use of your medical data. What did you find? FOWLER: You might be authorizing a company that you've never heard of to take your medical information and use it to market to you very specific pharmaceuticals. DAVIES: Wow. I mean, like, how does that work? FOWLER: I heard about this happening actually from a number of Washington Post readers who wrote to me about seeing something kind of curious when they were filling out their forms that they got asked to sign when they went to the doctor's office. And they pointed me that there was this company called Phreesia - that's Phreesia with a P-H - that was making the software that they were using to check in at their doctor's office. So you might have gotten this from a doctor that asks you to e-check in maybe the day before. Or when you arrive at the doctor's office, they hand you a tablet, and they say, OK, you know, fill in all this information here. And it's - a lot of it's the typical kinds of stuff. It's like, give me your name and your address and demographic information and what medications you're on and your previous history of ailments and all that kind of stuff. But there was one more form in the stack that said at the bottom, I agree. And the wall of text in it said, I agree to allow Phreesia to use the information that I just entered to show me very targeted marketing information based on my health care status. DAVIES: So let's understand this. I mean, is this the case of the medical practice deciding it's going to ask you to essentially waive the HIPAA right to privacy and allow the medical practice to sell the data? Or is it the party that does this? I mean, how does this work? FOWLER: Yeah. So the way HIPAA works is it applies to what are known as covered entities. So in this instance, your doctor is a covered entity, so your doctor is not allowed to share your health information without your permission. And there's all sorts of rules about how they must protect it and all kinds of stuff. But your doctor's office has contracted out to this company called Phreesia to make the software that is used for patient intake. So they - you know, they pay a fee to this Phreesia company to help them run the front office of their clinic, which I completely get. You know, doctors' offices are totally slammed. They have to collect all this information. This seems like a good deal. The thing is, Phreesia has this side business in marketing and targeted ads, and the folks who made the decision for your doctor's office or clinic to go with them may or may not even totally realize that that's happening. And under HIPAA, Phreesia is a business associate of the covered entity, which means that it is automatically allowed to have access to all of the data that you are sharing with your doctor for your care. But it is allowed if it gets you to click a button that says, I agree to use that data in other kinds of ways. And so we've developed all of these secondary uses of data. Some of them are arguably pretty good for our society. We get to know, for example, the COVID case rates, you know, that kind of information. It becomes much more accessible much more quickly. But businesses now have come along and decided that they want to come up with some secondary uses of the data. And this is one of them - Phreesia taking your health information and basically mining it, trying to figure out, OK, do we know who you are? Do you have some ailments that we have advertisers that they want to address? Or might you - future - you know, have some ailments you didn't even know about that we could make you aware of so that you'll go into the doctor's office in just a moment and ask your doctor about them? DAVIES: So you contacted this company that does this, Phreesia. What did they tell you? FOWLER: Phreesia says they do not sell our health information. This is actually really similar to an argument I often hear from Google and Facebook, which also do not technically sell your data to other companies. Instead, they mine your data and use it to target you with ads in a place where they've got your attention. In the case of Phreesia, the place they've got your attention is you're at the doctor's office. You just filled out information on a tablet given to you by the doctor, and you're waiting to see the doctor. And so they've got that screen in front of you, and that's where they're going to show you these ads, at that moment. In the case of Facebook and Google, it's when you're using their services. So it's a subtle, legal distinction, but practically, you know, for consumers, it doesn't make any difference. The pharmaceutical company may not know - may not actually have your medical record, but it's still able to use it to target you with messages about its products at the at the moment when they know you're most susceptible to them. DAVIES: And when you say you get the ads on the screen, you don't mean the tablet screen that has the text and the permission for them. You mean your smartphone if you're in the doctor's office? FOWLER: I mean literally on the tablet screen - yeah - that they handed you. DAVIES: Oh, really? So if I tell them I have high blood pressure, I'm going to get an ad for high blood pressure medication? FOWLER: You might. You might very well. Or they might try to use some kind of algorithm to decide, all right, Dave, you look like - you know, demographically and other ways, you look like someone who might have hidden high blood pressure. So let's plant that idea in your brain so you go in and you tell your doctor, hey, might I have high blood pressure? Do I need a medication for that? So that's the marketing game that they're playing. FOWLER: Let me reintroduce you again. We're going to take another break. We are speaking with Geoffrey Fowler. He's a technology columnist for The Washington Post. We'll continue our conversation after this short break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF JOSHUA REDMAN'S \"HIT THE ROAD JACK\") DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR, and we're speaking with Geoffrey Fowler. He's a technology columnist for The Washington Post based in San Francisco. He has a new series, an ongoing series, about privacy and other information issues with our apps and smartphones titled \"We The Users,\" which points out issues and offers some solutions. You know, our phones store so much information about us. And one thing you recently wrote about is the prospect that if the Supreme Court overturns the Roe v. Wade decision and abortion becomes a crime in some states, that law enforcement or others might get phone data to investigate who has sought or gotten or provided an illegal abortion. What could happen here? FOWLER: Your phone knows a lot about you, and so it would know if you were searching for information about where to get an abortion. It might know if you were at a clinic. It might know the history of your fertility cycle because a lot of people use cycle tracking apps. All of this data could be used against you if you happen to be in a state where seeking an abortion becomes against the law. There is some precedent for this already, that search histories and other information has been used to try to show that women were guilty of not caring for their fetuses or leading to the death of a baby. And the thing that I think people forget is any time that a company collects information about you, the government can get access to that information either by issuing a court order or increasingly, just by buying it. Right? We're talking about a giant industry economy of selling people's data. So increasingly, we are seeing government go and do that to gather evidence and to try to prosecute crimes. DAVIES: And could private actors do this, too? I mean, the Texas law, for example, offers essentially a financial incentive for a private citizen to find someone who's violated the abortion statutes. FOWLER: Indeed, a private actor could do this. And, in fact, the day after the leaked Roe v. Wade decision became news, some technology journalists went and bought a bunch of data from a location data broker where they were able to identify people who were at abortion clinics and where they were before they were at the clinic and then where they went afterwards. So even journalists are able to do this stuff. So, you know, folks who really want to make use of this kind of data certainly could. Another example of how data collected by companies can be used in unexpected ways is that recently a Catholic news organization got access to some data that indicated that a well-known priest was gay. And they did this by buying the data that they linked to the gay dating app Grindr and were able to track the location of one user from the known address of this priest and his known whereabouts to gay clubs and other sorts of places. And this priest had to end up resigning because of this. So, again, this is all done through private industry. DAVIES: So the journalist did a story of effectively outing this priest? FOWLER: Yeah. You know, and what these examples remind me is that digital rights are civil rights, you know, and these things are increasingly linked together. And that's why I think it's so important that we talk about what's being collected and what kind of control and power we have over it Because, you know, you can't tease them apart anymore. DAVIES: You know, on the issue of information about abortion, I was stunned to read something in one of your stories that you linked to another article showing that an anti-abortion group had gotten smartphone data to then target anti-abortion messages to the phones of patients in the waiting rooms of an abortion provider. This is pretty remarkable. How did this happen? FOWLER: Yeah, this happened, I believe, in Massachusetts, where as part of this targeted ad industry, you can target people in specific places. And so they did that with messages to people that they thought were in abortion clinics. I think Massachusetts has since made that illegal to do. But still, they showed that it is possible. So, you know, when we think that, oh, there's no real harm in, you know, allowing apps to collect our data or maybe even in seeing, you know, being targeted with ads in these kind of very ultra-specific kinds of ways, it can be hard to see in the future how this stuff might be used against us. But we're starting to get examples like this. DAVIES: You know, we began the conversation talking about kind of a comparison to the writing of the U. S. Constitution. And at a time in the late 18th century, when the country was governed by the Articles of Confederation, and they were outdated, and they didn't work, and we're now in a technology world where things need to change - what are the prospects for good legislation getting through Congress, do you think? FOWLER: They're better than they've ever been. So that's the positive sign. Right now, you know, there's new discussion about a privacy law in Washington. There's also discussion about several bills that would introduce more competition into the digital marketplaces, which I think would really make a big impact because that way, you know, companies would be forced to compete on privacy, forced to compete on having a well-run app store, forced to compete on, you know, the quality of search results and other sorts of things. So, you know, some of this is going to be hashed out this summer. And the bad news is - the thinking is that if some of this stuff doesn't pass in the next couple of months, it's going to be a long time, given the distractions of the midterm elections and the potential that the Democrats are going to lose control of Congress. So there's a lot of focus on this right now. DAVIES: OK. I'll just close by noting that Geoffrey Fowler's work is available online. It includes a lot of interesting links and videos that he does to explain a lot of this in simple terms. So, Geoffrey Fowler, thanks so much for speaking with us again. FOWLER: Thanks for having me.

And along with that, for some guests, there's concern - to paraphrase that old song - that somebody's watching them. Over the past few years, we've seen reports of Airbnb and Vrbo landlords posting private photos and information and unscrupulous hotel employees selling streams of what happens in hotel rooms. And we definitely don't want that. My goodness. But there are ways for travelers to protect themselves. And we're joined now by Thorin Klosowski, privacy and security editor at Wirecutter. Welcome. THORIN KLOSOWSKI: Hello. Thanks for having me. RASCOE: So first - and we should be clear that the people who do this, whether it's at Airbnb or a hotel - they are going against policy, right? KLOSOWSKI: Correct, yeah. Airbnb, like, specifically states that hosts need to disclose any cameras on the property, and those cameras should not be in any private areas, like a bathroom or a bedroom. RASCOE: And hotels obviously have the same sorts of policies. KLOSOWSKI: Yep. RASCOE: So let's start with you're going into a home - a Vrbo, an Airbnb situation. How do you know where there may be recording devices? KLOSOWSKI: The first thing that I would personally do is grab a flashlight, go to the kind of private areas that I would not expect a camera to be and flash that around to see if I see a reflection of what a camera lens would look like, which is kind of a blue reflection. You can also turn off all of the lights and you will see an IR signal. It's kind of like a red dot that glows. And if that's recording, like, a night vision, you would also see that. RASCOE: And are there apps out there now that are intended to help people find these hidden cameras? KLOSOWSKI: There are, and I don't love them. RASCOE: OK. KLOSOWSKI: I actually find the flashlight to be easier and a little bit better at finding things. A lot of the apps kind of have their own bad behaviors of often requiring a subscription fee or something like that that kind of feels a little icky. But they also - like, if you use them to scan for, say, a camera, it will kind of pick up any reflection. So glass or a camera would kind of show up the same thing. And then you end up just kind of walking close to it and inspecting it anyway. RASCOE: Have you ever found, like, a camera or anything where you were staying? KLOSOWSKI: No, I haven't. I have done the scans before. And, funnily enough, one of the reasons I don't trust the apps is because it wasn't even picking up the Ring camera, which was clearly on the door. And it can be useful, to be clear, but it also tends to be a little bit more technical, a little bit more complicated. You might not really know what you're looking at. And you might either be scared for nothing or be totally missing something important. RASCOE: So in addition to, like, the flashlight, is there anything else that you can do? KLOSOWSKI: Yeah, I think you can cover things up that maybe do look a little weird or you're unsure about. You can unplug the Wi-Fi router and, if you do so, it might alert the host. And you can also just kind of unplug anything that looks kind of fishy, whether that's an alarm clock or just a USB plug that seems random in the wall. RASCOE: And, I mean - so how worried should guests be about this? Like, you know, like, is this a really big issue? KLOSOWSKI: I haven't been able to find, like, a really great list of just how many times these get reported. And Airbnb does have policies in place, and they'd get picked up on the news enough that clearly, they've instituted rules. But I don't know how often they, you know, get reported.

(SOUNDBITE OF DROP ELECTRIC SONG, \"WAKING UP TO THE FIRE\")DARIAN WOODS, HOST:  Not too long ago, it was kind of difficult to trade stocks. If you wanted to buy or sell, you'd have to call up a broker and pay them a pretty sizable commission. ADRIAN MA, HOST:  Yeah. And by contrast, today, pretty much anyone with a smartphone and an account at a company like Robinhood or E-Trade or Charles Schwab - they can trade stocks for free. And who doesn't like to get something for free? WOODS: But that raises a big question - how are these companies making money then? They do it through a controversial practice known as payment for order flow. This is THE INDICATOR FROM PLANET MONEY. I'm Darian Woods. MA: And I'm Adrian Ma. Those four words, payment for order flow, have transformed stock trading in the past few years. So today on the show, we explain how it works, where it came from. Hint - it involves a man whose name rhymes with Ernie trade-off. WOODS: I think I know who you're talking about. And we look at why the SEC, the securities and exchange commission, wants to crack down on the practice. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)WOODS: Payment for order flow - what the heck does this mean? So we'll break it down with the players in a stock trade. You got a customer, a broker and somebody you might not have heard of before - a market maker. MA: So the customer - that's you - you know, you place that order with a stockbroker, like Robinhood, on an app to buy, I don't know, 10 shares of Indicator Incorporated. And I'm not exactly sure what Indicator Inc. sells. WOODS: We sell indicators - all the finest indicators. MA: Get them while they're hot - yes. And so then what Robinhood does is automatically send that order through the tubes of the internet to another company called a market maker. And one of the biggest market makers there is is a company called Citadel Securities. And what Citadel does is try to match up the buyers and the sellers and actually execute the trade. WOODS: And when it does - the buyer and the seller aren't actually trading with each other at the exact same price. There's this tiny difference. It's called a spread. And the stock is given to the buyer at a very slightly higher price than what the stock originally sold for - just, like, a penny or less. But those pennies add up, and that's where Citadel makes its money. MA: And this might sound like easy money - right? - like operating a tollbooth on a busy highway. But market making is not without risk. And that is because prices for stocks are always moving around. And if a market maker commits to making a trade and the price moves a lot in a direction they didn't expect, then the market maker can actually be left holding the bag - you know, that fraction of a penny that they were depending on can be wiped out. WOODS: And this is a particular problem when dealing with smart money, like hedge funds and banks - big professional traders whose massive orders can move prices. In economics, they call this a problem of adverse selection. MA: Pankaj Jain is a finance professor at the University of Memphis, and he studies financial market design. PANKAJ JAIN: So if there is a person who knows what the future earnings are going to look like - maybe an insider or some connection with the firm - and if that person is buying from you, you don't want to sell to them. MA: So that is why market makers don't love doing business with the smart money. By contrast, market makers love taking orders from relatively uninformed traders. JAIN: People are buying a stock not because they know that the earnings of that stock is going to come out very high during the earnings announcement, but I'm just buying the stock because I got a paycheck for my salary, and I want to invest. WOODS: So these so-called retail traders - i. e. , people like you and me, Adrian - we're not moving markets by buying or selling two shares of Indicator Inc. once a year. MA: No. As much as I would like to pump up the price of Indicator Inc. , I alone cannot do it. WOODS: And in the early '90s, the head of a market making company had an idea. What if you could just get orders from the uninformed traders? And that company has a name you might have heard of. JAIN: The oldest memory I have of this issue is a very successful firm, which later on turned out to be a little bit scandalous, was Madoff Investment. MA: Madoff Investments - and yes, that Madoff - Bernie Madoff. Before he became infamous for stealing billions of dollars in an elaborate Ponzi scheme, Bernie Madoff had a legit business as a market maker. And so when he hatched this plan, we imagine the conversation that followed went something like this. (SOUNDBITE OF PHONE RINGING)WOODS: Hello. Stockbroker here. MA: Hey, it's Madoff Investments. Look - we appreciate all the orders you've been sending us - right? - the big ones and the little ones. But we were actually wondering, can you send us more of those little retail trades? WOODS: You mean those piddly little trades from grandparents sending certificates of stocks to their grandchildren for Christmas? MA: Yeah. That sort of thing is exactly what we want. It is a lot easier and less risky for us to make money on those orders. WOODS: It sounds like a lot of work. MA: We can make it worth your while. We make so much money processing those kind of trades where we can actually kick some of it back to you. WOODS: You will pay us to send this flow of orders from retail traders your way. MA: That's right. We'll pay you for order flow. (SOUNDBITE OF CHIME SOUND EFFECT)WOODS: And scene. MA: And that, in a nutshell, is when payment for order flow took off. But it wasn't that widespread until the mid-2010s. That is when Robinhood came along. They combined Madoff's idea with something even more disruptive - zero-commission trades. Robinhood realized if they can get market makers like Citadel to pay them for orders, they could offer customers their service for free. And so pretty soon, Charles Schwab, E-Trade, Ameritrade - they all followed suit. JAIN: And that's where we are. Now most of the big brokers - they charge zero commissions. So that was a big source of revenues. If you think about it, brokers' main business - charge brokerage, provide the trading service. Now we charge zero commissions for the brokerage. And so the dependence on payment for order flow all of a sudden has become first order. WOODS: According to daytradings. com (ph), stockbrokers collected about $3. 6 billion in payments for order flow last year. And while the system profiting off order flow payments is currently legal, some financial regulators are saying that maybe it shouldn't be, especially after all the attention that Robinhood and meme stocks got last year. MA: The big criticism is that payment for order flow creates conflicts of interest. For example, some worry that it could create a situation where a stockbroker like Robinhood might care more about sending its orders to whatever market makers are going to pay them the most, rather than one that's going to give their customers the very best prices for their trade. WOODS: Thomas Ernst doesn't buy that particular argument. He's been researching payment for order flow at the University of Maryland, and he says that there are rules that say that customers have to be given the best price on their trades. And plus, there's always an electronic paper trail. THOMAS ERNST: 'Cause it's easy to say, did you give the customer the best price? We can look at the exchange price, look at the price your customer got, compare. That's pretty straightforward. MA: That said, Thomas is worried about something. The more customers trade, the more fees that brokers get from market makers. And so brokers like Robinhood have a huge motive to get users to trade as much as possible, even when it might not be in the customer's own interest. WOODS: Research has shown time and time again that people who are very active in trading tend to underperform against the market as a whole. And the other thing that Thomas is worried about is the type of securities that make up most of these order flow payments. ERNST: If you look at payment for order flow, around two-thirds of all payment for order flow comes from options trades. MA: Options are a type of security where you're betting on the price change of some stock or asset in the future. And as you can probably guess, it is pretty risky. Compared to stocks, you have a bigger chance of losing your entire investment. And here's the thing - with options, the spread is generally wider. So market makers pay brokers more money for those trades - sometimes twice as much. ERNST: I think it's actually quite problematic that options trades tend to pay a lot more per order, and that gives brokers kind of perverse incentives. MA: So payment for order flow - is it good, or is it bad? Well, it gave the world commission-free stock trading. But, you know, sometimes, free also comes with a price.

The price of Bitcoin has slid almost 70% since its peak last November, while some of the more innovative versions of virtual money have tanked altogether. Now there's a new reason for worry. A government commissioned report comes out today which raises questions about the technology behind cryptocurrencies and how secure it is from tampering. NPR's Martin Kaste reports. MARTIN KASTE, BYLINE: Cryptocurrency is more than just an investment, it's an ideology. It's the belief that nobody should be in charge of how money works, no company, no central bank, no government. Here's the emcee warming up the crowd at the Bitcoin 2022 conference in Miami back in April. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: One, two, three, freedom. Again, freedom. One more time, freedom. KASTE: This freedom is built on decentralization. You see, what you need to understand about cryptocurrencies is that the transactions - who bought a Bitcoin, who sold one - all of that is tracked on blockchains. And those are just ledgers, publicly visible lists of transactions replicated on computers around the world, too decentralized for anybody to tamper with in theory. DAN GUIDO: It's been taken for granted that blockchains are immutable and decentralized because the community says so. KASTE: That's Dan Guido, CEO of Trail of Bits, a software security research and development firm that just released a new report about this. The paper asks a fundamental question. GUIDO: Are there certain parties that control overwhelming percentages of the network? And the answer is, overwhelmingly, yes. KASTE: The report focuses on places on these blockchain networks where the traffic has become concentrated, like traffic bottlenecked on a freeway. And it shows how someone could use those bottlenecks to take over the blockchain process, say, to stop someone from getting paid or just to make an asset disappear. This is usually called a 51% attack because you're trying to take over most of the network. But Guido's team has found that you'd really need only 49%, and because of those bottlenecks, sometimes even less. GUIDO: Let's say somebody with great top-down control of the internet in their country starts to interfere with that network, we can actually start bringing that 49% down to 40%, to 35%. And these sorts of margins of safety get whittled away. KASTE: You could see a scenario in which, say, Russia used this approach to block crypto donations to Ukraine. And that's where you start to see the strategic importance of all this and why this report was commissioned by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency - known as DARPA. JOSH BARON: So one of the missions for DARPA is preventing technological surprise. KASTE: Josh Baron is a program manager with the agency. He says the report gathers in one place existing research into the vulnerabilities. And he says some of the details are, quote, \"eyebrow-raising. \"BARON: So for example, the idea that 21% of Bitcoin nodes are running an old version of the Bitcoin core client that's known to be vulnerable. KASTE: Just to explain that for a second, what he's talking about there is that 21% of those Bitcoin nodes are running software with a known flaw. So they could all be hacked the same way. BARON: So like, you're already worried about 51%. And now I'm telling you that 21% are just out there for the taking, as it were, right? That's not great. KASTE: He sees this report as a guide for fixing vulnerabilities as blockchain networks become more important. But the government isn't going to impose those fixes because it can't. Crypto is decentralized. You need a consensus in that loose community of people who help to run these networks. And right now, this centralization doesn't seem to be much of a concern. Big crypto companies such as Coinbase are more focused right now on the volatility of prices. They declined to comment about the report to NPR. But at a smaller Bitcoin services company called swan. com, co-founder Yan Pritzker called these dangers theoretical. YAN PRITZKER: If this kind of attack is possible, why hasn't it happened, right? So I think the proof is in the pudding a little bit. In real-world conditions, these things don't happen. KASTE: Pritzker agrees with the report on one point. There is more centralization in some of the newer forms of cryptocurrency, especially those that use a different kind of blockchain system called proof-of-stake, which uses less power. He's confident in the older, more energy-intensive system used by Bitcoin. PRITZKER: Whatever you do in the short run to damage Bitcoin - like, let's say you were actually able to stop Bitcoin from producing blocks for even, like, a day. If you end that attack, the coin will go back to normal. And then all you've done is you've just proven that it's impossible to attack. KASTE: This comes down to a debate over whether people investing, say, their retirement funds should consider cryptocurrencies to be a proven technology. At Trail of Bits, Dan Guido says he's not anti-blockchain. He thinks they have a lot of promise. But to him, this kind of virtual money is still a prototype. GUIDO: Everybody needs to know kind of what they're buying, what they're buying into, what they're going to trust. And there's a lot here that you should not trust, at least not today. KASTE: Martin Kaste, NPR News. LEILA FADEL, HOST:   Cryptocurrencies are having a bad year. The price of Bitcoin has slid almost 70% since its peak last November, while some of the more innovative versions of virtual money have tanked altogether. Now there's a new reason for worry. A government commissioned report comes out today which raises questions about the technology behind cryptocurrencies and how secure it is from tampering. NPR's Martin Kaste reports. MARTIN KASTE, BYLINE: Cryptocurrency is more than just an investment, it's an ideology. It's the belief that nobody should be in charge of how money works, no company, no central bank, no government. Here's the emcee warming up the crowd at the Bitcoin 2022 conference in Miami back in April. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: One, two, three, freedom. Again, freedom. One more time, freedom. KASTE: This freedom is built on decentralization. You see, what you need to understand about cryptocurrencies is that the transactions - who bought a Bitcoin, who sold one - all of that is tracked on blockchains. And those are just ledgers, publicly visible lists of transactions replicated on computers around the world, too decentralized for anybody to tamper with in theory. DAN GUIDO: It's been taken for granted that blockchains are immutable and decentralized because the community says so. KASTE: That's Dan Guido, CEO of Trail of Bits, a software security research and development firm that just released a new report about this. The paper asks a fundamental question. GUIDO: Are there certain parties that control overwhelming percentages of the network? And the answer is, overwhelmingly, yes. KASTE: The report focuses on places on these blockchain networks where the traffic has become concentrated, like traffic bottlenecked on a freeway. And it shows how someone could use those bottlenecks to take over the blockchain process, say, to stop someone from getting paid or just to make an asset disappear. This is usually called a 51% attack because you're trying to take over most of the network. But Guido's team has found that you'd really need only 49%, and because of those bottlenecks, sometimes even less. GUIDO: Let's say somebody with great top-down control of the internet in their country starts to interfere with that network, we can actually start bringing that 49% down to 40%, to 35%. And these sorts of margins of safety get whittled away. KASTE: You could see a scenario in which, say, Russia used this approach to block crypto donations to Ukraine. And that's where you start to see the strategic importance of all this and why this report was commissioned by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency - known as DARPA.

(SOUNDBITE OF DROP ELECTRIC SONG, \"WAKING UP TO THE FIRE\")WAILIN WONG, HOST:  This is THE INDICATOR FROM PLANET MONEY. I'm Wailin Wong. PADDY HIRSCH, HOST:  And I'm Paddy Hirsch. The crypto-verse - that's cryptocurrencies and all the financial technology associated with them - has had a rough time lately. The flagship crypto asset, bitcoin, has fallen sharply in value. Its market capitalization is down to roughly $390 billion - about the same level it was in December of 2020. WONG: It's quite a reverse from October of last year when bitcoin had a market cap of $1. 14 trillion, and Matt Damon was pitching crypto. com. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MATT DAMON: Fortune favors the brave. HIRSCH: Fortune favors the brave. I love it. Thanks, Matt. Since that ad aired, the total value of crypto assets has dropped by two-thirds. It was at $3 trillion. Now it's 1 trillion - in fact, less than that. I really, really, really want to call Matt Damon up and ask him how brave he's feeling right now. But I don't have his number. WONG: And he's ignoring all my texts. I don't know why. HIRSCH: What? He's such a devil. WONG: Most investors in crypto are institutions, but a lot of individuals have made bets on crypto - some because they believe in the future of the blockchain and cryptocurrency, others because they've seen the gains many crypto firms have made, and they want to jump on that train. HIRSCH: Yeah. A Pew Research Center survey found that 16% of U. S. adults said they had invested in, traded or used a cryptocurrency. That is a lot of exposure to one of the riskiest assets known to humankind, and the recent collapse adds up to a lot of money being lost by a lot of people. So we're going to spend some time in THE INDICATOR exploring the fallout from this collapse in a series of stories today and next week. WONG: On today's show, we look at the effect of the meltdown in crypto on the wider economy. A lot of money was lost, and a lot of people in the crypto-verse are hurting. But what about those of us who have no exposure to crypto? And that's most of us. How much do we really need to care? (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)HIRSCH: Recently, crypto investors have been having - not to put too fine a point on it - an absolute nightmare. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #1: Because we know it has been several consecutive days of brutal selling for bitcoin. . . UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #2: Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have taken a nosedive as. . . UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #3: It was another cringe day for crypto. Digital currency. . . WONG: And you can divide crypto investors into two groups. You've got your institutions - that's investment funds and venture capitalists and all of that. And you've got retail investors - people like you and me. HIRSCH: Emma Rose Bienvenu is the chief of staff at Pantera Capital. Pantera's a fund that invests exclusively in companies associated with bitcoin and crypto. Here's what she had to say about last week's meltdown. EMMA ROSE BIENVENU: I mean, obviously, you know, these - the bull markets are a lot more fun than the bear markets. WONG: And we're definitely in a bear market when it comes to crypto. A bear market is when a market index falls by 20% or more from its most recent high. Crypto assets fell nearly 70%. So that's like a grizzly bear market. But Emma didn't seem that fazed by the fallout. BIENVENU: This wasn't a failing of crypto or blockchain technology itself. It was the asset responding exactly as a risk on, you know, highly liquid asset would react to the market environment in which we find ourselves because of, you know, high inflation and Fed tightening. A person that doesn't have exposure to crypto - like, I would encourage them - you know, it's a great time to buy. HIRSCH: A great time to buy, Wailin. WONG: I think I'm going to pass. I'm too scared. HIRSCH: Not a failing. Anyway, Emma would not say whether Pantera has lost money, but she pointed out that like most investment firms, hers is configured to weather, and possibly even profit from, these kinds of downturns. Now, that's not the same for individual investors - many of whom have complained in news reports and on social media platforms like Reddit that they lost thousands of dollars. WONG: And there are a lot of individual investors in crypto. An annual Fed survey found that 12% of American adults used or held crypto purely for investment in the last year. Now, they probably didn't all lose their money, but that's 31 million people. Surely that's going to affect the economy in some way? HIRSCH: Well, you'd think so. But Jamie Cox says probably not. He's managing partner of Harris Financial Group in Richmond, Va. JAMIE COX: This is not going to have the same deleterious effect that we saw with the housing market, you know, rippling into banks and creating insolvencies and then leading to a potential - a global financial crisis that could have led easily into a global depression. That's not where we are. WONG: Jamie's not making light of the losses, but he says the wider economy is pretty insulated from them. First of all, the amounts of money we're talking about are comparatively small. The market capitalization of the entire crypto market is less than $1 trillion. HIRSCH: Yeah. A trillion dollars may sound like a lot, but it's actually less than half of the market capitalization of Apple or Amazon. So the danger of an individual fund's losses on crypto rippling through the market are pretty low, Jamie says. And as for those individual investor losses. . . COX: The good news is, is there's plenty of money in the system. People have jobs. They're not at risk of hurting themselves permanently by making some bad financial choices like they would have if this had been 2008. HIRSCH: Back then, people borrowed heavily to buy houses they couldn't afford from banks that were willing to lend them the money, no questions asked. When the market turned down, many of those people lost everything. The banks went into a tailspin, and the entire global economy nearly collapsed. WONG: But this time around, people generally aren't borrowing huge amounts of money to invest in crypto. Perhaps more importantly, neither individuals nor corporations are using crypto assets as collateral for loans. HIRSCH: This is a big deal - right? - because when people or companies borrow money, they have to provide collateral, some security. That's some kind of asset that the lender can take and sell if the borrower defaults. Like, if you borrow money to buy a house, then the house is the collateral. And if you fail to make your mortgage payments, then the bank can take your home. WONG: Companies use all kinds of stuff as collateral for the loans they borrow. But for the most part, no one right now is using crypto assets. They're too risky, too volatile, too uncertain. And that means that the corporate loan economy - all $22 trillion of it - is not affected by what's going on in crypto-land. HIRSCH: And lenders' refusal to accept crypto assets as collateral for loans is like this huge firewall between the crypto-verse and the wider U. S. economy. That's not to say that crypto doesn't leak through here and there. Jamie says the stock market's a bit of a weak link because publicly traded corporations are increasingly beginning to dabble in crypto. COX: There's lots of ownership in cryptocurrency that didn't exist a couple of years ago. The more notable ones are Tesla or MicroStrategy, but there are plenty of others - insurance companies and the like - who have taken positions, albeit small relative to their balance sheet, but trying to learn how these things work. So it's a contributing factor to some of the declines in the Nasdaq. WONG: In other words, while the U. S. economy is pretty insulated from the ups and downs of the crypto-verse for now, things are moving fast. Crypto assets are becoming increasingly mainstream. HIRSCH: And that means more and more Americans are going to become exposed to that world, either directly through their own investments or indirectly by owning stock in companies that have put money into crypto. And Jamie says that's something that the government is very aware of. COX: I think that regulation was already being teed up, but it is definitely going to come in a major way. You're going to see the SEC regulate to make investment advisors and things like that have higher fiduciary standards. And then you're going to have Congress come in and basically have a framework where it's going to be really, really difficult to have these things, you know, negotiable and operable in the United States. HIRSCH: Regulation - that might sound like a bummer for freedom-loving crypto-heads. But Emma Rose Bienvenu at Pantera Capital - remember, Pantera invests exclusively in the crypto-verse - she agrees that some regulation is needed, if only to protect individual investors. BIENVENU: There's kind of a trope that, you know, people who are working in crypto investment firms are anti-regulation and just kind of, you know, libertarian. That's actually not the case at all for us. We think sensible regulation would be very good. And a lot of very dishonest projects, you know, led to a lot of sort of people that just didn't really know how these products work losing their life savings. And that is unacceptable. WONG: A lot of people believe that the blockchain and cryptocurrency are the future of finance. Even governments are getting on board the crypto train. But that doesn't mean that going forward, the crypto market is going to be any less volatile or risky than it is today. HIRSCH: Yeah. It could actually mean greater risk to the economy as these companies get bigger and more people invest in them. So yes, we can afford to wave off if not ignore this latest crypto meltdown, but we probably won't have that luxury for very much longer.

Australian researcher Chris Rinke studies them. CHRIS RINKE: They are called superworms. But if you look very close, you can see they actually have six legs. They are actually the larvae of the darkling beetle. INSKEEP: And who wouldn't want to look very closely? He and his colleagues have been feeding these bugs nothing but polystyrene. That's the scientific name for Styrofoam. RINKE: They're really eating machines. Their main goal is to gain as much weight as they can to then become a pupa and a beetle. So they're not very picky eaters. FADEL: The scientists are trying to figure out how the larvae break down the plastic waste. RINKE: We could, you know, have, like, gigantic worm farms with millions of worms and feed them polystyrene. But what scales way better and is, I would say, also cheaper is to focus on the enzymes. INSKEEP: Yeah, the insects produce enzymes that break things down - enzymes that, in turn, could one day be reproduced in a lab. RINKE: Polystyrene waste, which is a rather low-value product - it goes through this biological degradation using the enzymes. And then you can feed it to microbes to then produce something like bioplastic, which is actually a higher-value product. FADEL: Rinke hopes this work will encourage people to recycle more. His journey into insects and plastic research began during a sailing trip with his wife. RINKE: We stopped at a beautiful uninhabited island in French Polynesia, and we stayed there for a week. It was paradise. But if you look very carefully, you can see - you're on a tropical island, somewhere thousands of miles away from any continent, and there is plastic debris. And that was one of the reasons why I wanted to look into that. FADEL: Now he's looking for answers to a big problem inside the guts of a tiny bug.

They are actually the larvae of the darkling beetle. INSKEEP: And who wouldn't want to look very closely? He and his colleagues have been feeding these bugs nothing but polystyrene. That's the scientific name for Styrofoam. RINKE: They're really eating machines. Their main goal is to gain as much weight as they can to then become a pupa and a beetle. So they're not very picky eaters. FADEL: The scientists are trying to figure out how the larvae break down the plastic waste. RINKE: We could, you know, have, like, gigantic worm farms with millions of worms and feed them polystyrene. But what scales way better and is, I would say, also cheaper is to focus on the enzymes. INSKEEP: Yeah, the insects produce enzymes that break things down - enzymes that, in turn, could one day be reproduced in a lab. RINKE: Polystyrene waste, which is a rather low-value product - it goes through this biological degradation using the enzymes. And then you can feed it to microbes to then produce something like bioplastic, which is actually a higher-value product. FADEL: Rinke hopes this work will encourage people to recycle more. His journey into insects and plastic research began during a sailing trip with his wife. RINKE: We stopped at a beautiful uninhabited island in French Polynesia, and we stayed there for a week. It was paradise. But if you look very carefully, you can see - you're on a tropical island, somewhere thousands of miles away from any continent, and there is plastic debris. And that was one of the reasons why I wanted to look into that. FADEL: Now he's looking for answers to a big problem inside the guts of a tiny bug.

Who of us has not fantasized about leaving work fully at work, having the freedom not to worry about that email or that boss when you're spending time with family or friends? There's this show on Apple TV+ called \"Severance. \" You might have heard of it. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"SEVERANCE\")BRITT LOWER: (As Helly Riggs) So I'll never leave here. ADAM SCOTT: (As Mark Scout) You'll leave at 5. WARNER: It takes that fantasy to a kind of terrifying extreme. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"SEVERANCE\")SCOTT: (As Mark Scout) But it won't feel like it, not to this version of you anyway. WARNER: The premise of the show is that a company called Lumon has found ways to let employees surgically separate their work memories from their outside-work memories. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"SEVERANCE\")LOWER: (As Helly Riggs) Do I have a family? SCOTT: (As Mark Scout) You'll never know. WARNER: This is a voluntary procedure. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"SEVERANCE\")SCOTT: (As Mark Scout) Well, every time you find yourself here, it's because you chose to come back. WARNER: So their outie (ph), or their outside work self, has no idea what they do at work all day, and their innie (ph) has no clue how they spend their free time. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"SEVERANCE\")LOWER: (As Helly Riggs) I have no choice. WARNER: And this weird thing quickly happens where their innie and their outie split off into completely different personalities. It's something that a lot of you told us you recognize. SEAN: I'm a completely different person at work. I keep to a very specific script of watercooler talk. KATTIA: As a woman, I had to be very tough and very serious. ALLINA: And so having to wear slacks and a button down and not be able to have any piercings and not be able to have tattoos and not be able to dye your hair does start to affect how you present yourself. WARNER: We asked you about your work self. Is it you? NOELLE: My work self is really similar to my out of work self. ANNALIESE: My work self is less direct. ALLINA: And because we spend so much time at work, I see it bleeding into my personal life. WARNER: And you told us that bringing your true self to work, it can be an act of resistance. . . ANNALIESE: It feels good to be good at your job. But it is just a job to me. WARNER: . . . Or exhaustion. CHELSEA: I got tired of trying to separate and manage work Chelsea from home Chelsea from church Chelsea and karaoke Chelsea. WARNER: This is ROUGH TRANSLATION. I'm Gregory Warner. Today on the show, two stories about that gap between your work self and your outside-work self, two stories where someone takes on an innie that they do not quite recognize, that feels almost like a stranger, but that shows them something about the person they did not think they could be. In one story, that work self is a new name; in another, a new body. You're at work with ROUGH TRANSLATION, back after this break. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)WARNER: We are back now with ROUGH TRANSLATION. I'm Gregory Warner. What is in a name? It is an age-old question. If you're a star-crossed lover in a Shakespeare play, your family name is the thing that keeps you apart. In our next story, the name you're given at work, it keeps you apart from yourself. And here to explain all that. . . SE EUN GONG, BYLINE: Yeah, it's brewing now. WARNER: . . . Se Eun Gong. GONG: Hi, Gregory. WARNER: So how are you feeling? GONG: Nervous (laughter). WARNER: If you've heard an NPR story out of South Korea for the past four years, Se Eun likely had a hand in it. She is a journalist in NPR's bureau in Seoul, though she's usually working behind the scenes instead of in front of the mic. GONG: Yeah, I'll - (laughter) I'll try my best. WARNER: So if we were speaking Korean right now and if we were in the same office and I just addressed you as Se Eun, which is what I call you. . . GONG: Right. WARNER: . . . Would that be a problem? And who's - like, who would it be awkward for? GONG: Well, in this context, you are senior in age and work experience. It's OK for someone higher up to address someone lower. So if you are calling me just Se Eun, that's perfectly fine. If we were Korean speakers and I would call you Gregory, that would be considered unusual. WARNER: Unusual? GONG: It just - it feels rude. WARNER: South Korean businesses are respectful of these hierarchies of age and experience, but they can also create a climate of silence that squelch good ideas and free-flowing communication. A 2017 survey by the Korean Chamber of Commerce found that nearly 70% of Korean corporate workers don't actively voice their opinions at meetings. GONG: Younger workers would feel like they cannot raise objections to bad ideas of their bosses for fear that they can be seen as presumptuous. WARNER: And your name is part of that. How people greet you marks your relative age and rank. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)GONG: English nicknames - it's a helpful trick. WARNER: And so there is a growing trend in South Korea - it began with tech startups, but it spread to other industries - to change the names that people use at work. GONG: Yeah, a lot of job postings will advertise the fact that they use English nicknames. WARNER: Oh, so like, hey, we pay well, we offer good benefits, we use English nicknames? GONG: Yeah. WARNER: These are Korean-speaking workplaces where you go by a single English first name. And the idea is that instead of having to adjust what you call someone based on their rank or age, everyone in the company would be on a first-name basis. GONG: I mean, I, for one, was initially skeptical how effective this would be. I suspected that it would be not much more than window dressing. So I met this person. . . SHIN HYE JEE: (Speaking Korean). GONG: Shin Hye Jee. SHIN: (Speaking Korean). GONG: She's a 27-year-old woman who works at a startup accelerator. So she learned about the company's English nickname policy during her onboarding process. WARNER: So, yeah, so she shows up at her first day of work, and what happens? GONG: She gets there, and then she went into a meeting where the head of the company attended. WARNER: Wow, right away. GONG: Yeah. WARNER: She meets her new colleagues, a bunch of Daves and Carols and Sarahs and Susans. And the thing about using English nicknames is you don't attach someone's title. In her old job, Hye Jee used the standard Korean naming convention with titles attached. GONG: So she was called. . . SHIN: (Speaking Korean). GONG: Shin Hye Jee daeri neem - Shin Hye Jee, her full name, daeri, the title, and neem, the honorific. WARNER: So it would be like every time Se Eun greeted me, she had to say, Mr. Podcast Host Warner. Every time a co-worker told Hye Jee hello. . . SHIN: (Speaking Korean). WARNER: . . . Or goodbye. . . SHIN: (Speaking Korean). WARNER: The title followed her everywhere. So what is her title, actually? GONG: Daeri, daeri. Why don't I first explain the conventional titles in a company? At the top there's (speaking Korean), chairperson. Below (speaking Korean), there's (speaking Korean), president, (speaking Korean), director, (speaking Korean), division chief, (speaking Korean), deputy division chief, (speaking Korean), section chief, daeri, deputy section chief, which is Hye Jee's title - old title - and then (speaking Korean), the lowest. It's just staff. WARNER: Those titles disappear when people use English nicknames. Or at least they're supposed to. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"THE PLEASURES AND SORROWS OF WORK\")UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #1: (As David) I am David. UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #2: (As Andrew) I'm Andrew. WARNER: This is from a TV adaptation of a short story by Jang Ryujin. It's called \"The Pleasures And Sorrows Of Work,\" and one storyline follows a fictional Korean tech startup with an English nickname policy that gets totally misused. People start attaching the titles and the honorifics to the English nicknames. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"THE PLEASURES AND SORROWS OF WORK\")UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #3: (As character, speaking Korean). WARNER: And readers of the short story wrote in to say that, yes, they recognize this. Their company does the same thing. Despite the English nicknames, hierarchy reasserts itself. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"THE PLEASURES AND SORROWS OF WORK\")UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #1: (As character) Just like Silicon Valley. WARNER: So Hye Jee. . . GONG: She was a bit nervous about having to call the boss by just his first name. WARNER: She was extra cautious that first day on the job. GONG: She's the kind of person who, in that kind of setting, first watches how others do it. And she saw someone calling the head of the company by his English name. And then she realized, oh, like, this is really OK here to do that. WARNER: It took a few weeks, but she finally got used to it, chatting with the boss on a first-name basis. GONG: She felt like she was talking to him having shed the insignia. And this is a pretty commonplace expression in the Korean language, meaning that you're doing something free from the social hierarchy. WARNER: But using these new names - it didn't just change how she communicated with her bosses. It changed how she saw herself. SHIN: (Speaking Korean). GONG: She said she's thinking to herself when she arrives at the office that. . . SHIN: (Speaking Korean). GONG: . . . From here on, I'm not Shin Hye Jee, but I'm Hannah. SHIN: (Speaking Korean). GONG: She said her English name, Hannah, gives her a work persona. SHIN: (Speaking Korean). GONG: And that person, the Hannah, she thinks, is a braver version of herself. SHIN: (Speaking Korean). GONG: She would voice grievances to the head of the company with ease. It's something that she couldn't imagine doing in her previous workplace. WARNER: Where did this bravery come from? Was it just that the rules of behavior changed, or did this name allow something inside herself to be revealed? We called up one of the early adopters of this English name policy, JiHyun Won. He's the co-founder and COO of a video streaming company called Watcha. ALEX JIHYUN WON: At Watcha, I am not COO. I am Alex. GONG: Have you always had that name, Alex? WON: No, actually, no. I picked Alex as my English name because I am a big fan of the English football club Manchester United and their legendary manager. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER: The greatest British manager ever, Sir Alex Ferguson. (CHEERING)WON: Alex Ferguson. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)WARNER: He tells us about two years after they put in this English name policy, it came to the test. There was this intern who got really angry about all the problems in their code. WON: He was a software engineer. And he was mad. WARNER: The intern confronted the COO, but he didn't call him COO; he called him Alex. WON: He directly raised the problems in the company, and we listened to him, how we can fix them. So small changes can make big differences. WARNER: As a Korean startup, they have to compete with global players, like Netflix and Disney+. WON: A good idea deserves recognition, no matter what, and should not be overshadowed by hierarchy. WARNER: But these shadows of hierarchy can fall both ways. Alex, the COO, he's younger than many of his employees. GONG: And you may feel more comfortable talking to them as the boss, but as a younger boss, is that the case? WON: Yeah. We started to not remember people's age here. But in Korea, that is a big change. WARNER: Those older employees who he found it so awkward to talk to when he used their Korean names and titles, it actually changed how they saw him. They'd tell him. WON: Oh, you were younger than me. I didn't know that for two years. That is a big thing here, yeah. WARNER: They'll not only forget his age difference. WON: So we are confused sometimes that - what is your original name? Like, something like that. WARNER: (Laughter). WON: Hey, Alex, what's your name? Yeah. WARNER: Wait. Really? WON: Yeah. We don't - actually, we don't remember other colleagues' Korean name. So it's kind of weird, but yeah. WARNER: And this is a big reason, he says, why the English name policy is working for their company. It literally allows people to forget their old self, their more age- and rank-conscious self, at the office gates. WON: And that is why even big, major companies are adopting English name policies and abandoning their traditional position-first, title-first way of culture. So it's already becoming a trend. WARNER: That's interesting. So if a whole generation stops remembering people's ages - you're nodding. You're saying - does that sound like a good future to you? WON: Yes. The next generations, millennials and Gen Z, desire for a horizontal culture at the office. WARNER: But is it only at the office? Or might this relaxing of conventions inside the workplace lead to different behaviors outside as well? Alex hopes it will because, imagine, as English name policies become more and more common across Korean industries, will all those brave Hannahs and outspoken Andrews really stay meekly at the office? Or will they try, like the characters in \"Severance,\" to send secret messages to their outie? Does Alex and JiHyun, are they different for you? Are you a different person as Alex and different as JiHyun? WON: Yeah, I think different. I think JiHyun is more personal. And Alex - if someone called me Alex, then I feel like, OK, I'm working. WARNER: You can probably hear this in his voice, but as Alex is answering this, his shoulders slump, and he looks like a guy who's, well, imagining himself at work. WON: So I feel very different. WARNER: The freedom that he feels engaging with others as Alex is tempered with a kind of alienation. As Alex, he never feels like he's truly himself. Alex is a work identity, and therefore, Alex doesn't have parents. Alex doesn't have a childhood. But also, Alex doesn't have to negotiate his place in society as JiHyun might. WON: Korean language conveys a sense of hierarchy in its grammatical structure itself. So calling me Alex, it automatically gets rid of such feeling. WARNER: It's less formal, but it's less personal. WON: Yeah. Right. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)WARNER: And this impersonalness, this alienation of the work self, this is exactly what's allowed Hye Jee to explore this new side of herself. As Hannah, she finds herself reacting differently to how her colleagues treat her. SHIN: (Speaking Korean). GONG: If Hye Jee, her original identity, would look over something that's annoying her and just move on, when she's in the Hannah mode, she feels the anger building up in herself, and she would actually say what she needs to say to vent that anger. SHIN: (Speaking Korean). WARNER: Well, it's interesting just listening to you, and it's something so surprising. I'm trying to digest it. But I could maybe imagine that wearing a mask might allow me to behave differently. But the things that she would not notice, now she notices and make her angry. It's not just that she behaves differently, but she actually feels different. GONG: Yeah. I mean, you know, one definition of brave, I think, can be being honest about yourself and to yourself. If the Hye Jee personality would require that she suppress that kind of feelings and act in a way that's more socially acceptable, switching to Hannah, yeah, she gets free from that kind of burden. WARNER: That freedom, it ends with the end of the workday. . . SHIN: (Speaking Korean). WARNER: . . . Which is how Hye Jee wants it. GONG: Outside of work, she just wants to be Hye Jee, and it's not even a conscious effort because she's called Hannah only at work. SHIN: (Speaking Korean). WARNER: There's this scene in \"Severance\" where there's a kind of somber discussion about what might happen to innies if their outies find a new job. You can feel the powerlessness of being a work self in that moment, imagining that some person who is you, but a you you've never met, might decide to just pull the plug on your life. And then everything you know, the feel of your desk chair, the smell of the break room, that really banal office joke that that guy keeps repeating, all of that stuff, basically your whole world, will just cease to exist. And the part of you that is the only you that you know will just be gone. GONG: Even though she's experienced her Hannah self, if in future she goes to work at a different company that doesn't use English nicknames and has a strict hierarchy, she thinks she'll go back to the way she carried herself in her previous workplace. SHIN: (Speaking Korean). GONG: But then she'll think about Hannah for a long time, lamenting how she can't be that way anymore. SHIN: (Speaking Korean). WARNER: After the break, we suit up for a pixilated version of our work selves and enter the metaverse office, which can be a lonely place. PABLO ARGUELLES, BYLINE: It feels like I'm walking in these ghost towns. WARNER: But maybe it doesn't have to be. THU OLIVEIRA: Cuica? You know cuica? WARNER: When ROUGH TRANSLATION returns. We're back with ROUGH TRANSLATION. I'm Gregory Warner. And this next story about work selves and ourselves at work, it takes us to Campinas near Sao Paulo, Brazil. OLIVEIRA: Hi. Hello. Hi. Sound. One, two, three. WARNER: Thu Oliveira - spelled T-H-U - knows that some of her old coworkers used to roll their eyes at her pranks. OLIVEIRA: I don't know who I am without pranks. WARNER: She's the kind of coworker who would sneak up behind you. . . OLIVEIRA: (Speaking Portuguese). WARNER: . . . Crawling on the floor like a cat. . . OLIVEIRA: (Speaking Portuguese). WARNER: . . . And then. . . OLIVEIRA: Piff. Hi, Pablo. WARNER: Thu spoke to our producer, Pablo Arguelles. ARGUELLES: Thu says that sometimes in the office when she did these pranks - well, she uses this Portuguese expression, perder a mao. OLIVEIRA: Perder a mao in Portuguese is like when you cross the line because too many jokes, too many pranks, and then you stop and you think, oh, man, I really crossed the line here. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ARGUELLES: I get what she means because I think I'm the kind of worker who would painfully smile at her and never tell her, Thu, I think I need a little bit of space here. But she says that she could read it on people's faces sometimes. And yet she still did these pranks. . . OLIVEIRA: Of course. ARGUELLES: . . . Because to her they had a higher purpose. OLIVEIRA: Imagine you were having a bad day. ARGUELLES: And she's bringing joy to the office. OLIVEIRA: I think the energy can improve that, can make you forget, even for a moment, if you're having a bad day. ARGUELLES: So she would go around wishing everyone good morning. OLIVEIRA: (Speaking Portuguese). ARGUELLES: Almost like a ritual. OLIVEIRA: (Speaking Portuguese). ARGUELLES: And she would play music for you in the office. OLIVEIRA: A cuica. You know cuica? That's a samba instrument, yes. WARNER: But when the pandemic hit and Thu's company went remote, it was tough. ARGUELLES: She lives alone. She just had a break up. OLIVEIRA: (Speaking Portuguese). ARGUELLES: And she's working remotely, only seeing her dogs and cats. OLIVEIRA: (Speaking Portuguese). WARNER: She could see people's status light and their calendar availability. . . OLIVEIRA: Open a link. Close a link. Open a link. Close a link. WARNER: . . . But not actually have any shared experiences, not randomly bump into anyone or join them for a stroll. ARGUELLES: And when she try to do pranks on Zoom, obviously, they were followed by very uncomfortable silences. OLIVEIRA: Yes, yes, uncomfortable silence. It's so sad. It's so sad. WARNER: And the worrying part was that some of her co-workers seemed to prefer it this way. According to the 2022 State of Remote Work report by the social media management company Buffer, which surveyed more than 2,000 people from 16 countries, 97% of us - so basically everyone - would recommend remote work to others, but 52% said they felt less connected to their coworkers. Twenty-four percent felt more lonely. And Thu wondered, did her co-workers realize what they were missing? A chance to just have random memories of things happening at the office. OLIVEIRA: I don't know if they are work memories, but life memories even at work. ARGUELLES: What was the lowest point for you? OLIVEIRA: The lowest point - when I turned my computer off, and I was still at home. But when you - poof - power off, back to your reality, I think, oh, man, I'm still at home. WARNER: Thu felt herself losing focus. She spun out, and she left her job. She got hired as head of marketing at a design firm called Weme. And Weme said it was trying an experiment, a way they hoped would combine the convenience of remote work with the community of a real office. Everyone would log on from home and choose an avatar, and then the avatars would meet in a virtual platform called Gather. OLIVEIRA: How does it work? It's a metaverse? It's not a metaverse. It's a game? It seems like a game. ARGUELLES: The places look like an old video game, like Zelda or Pokemon. And they're very pixelated and two-dimensional. WARNER: Before we met Thu, we asked Pablo to check out these virtual co-working spaces around the world that use this Gather platform. And these were mostly public co-working spaces, as opposed to private offices. So anyone could enter. And because it's virtual, these places are all really different. Like, you can go to work in a super boring cubicle with a bunch of fluorescent lights, or you can file your papers in a pirate ship or a medieval castle. ARGUELLES: And then there's like a big forest, a very \"Lord Of The Rings\" kind of co-working place. So just imagine my tiny avatar there with my pixelated curly hair, big eyes, my set of headphones entering these spaces. And I went to one in Indonesia, one in South Korea, a couple of them in Brazil, one in Chile and one in the Czech Republic and a couple of American ones. And I just found them on the internet and dropped right in and started wandering around. But they were empty. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ARGUELLES: I remember that in one of these places, it was like a big city next to the ocean. The only sound that you could hear was the sound of the waves and of the seagulls. WARNER: Oh, my - it's so dystopic. It's so crazy. The background noise, the seagulls - (imitating seagull). ARGUELLES: (Laughter) Yeah. So imagine visiting all of these places - empty, like, really sad places, not a soul. So very frightening also. And I even found a place with a guest book, and I could see the comments that were left there. And one said this place was built by 20 people, but now it's a ghost town. WARNER: It seemed like the fate of so many digital gatherings - from watercooler channels on Slack to happy hours convened on Zoom. So many pandemic efforts intended to counter loneliness make us more lonely because so few people show up. Thu wondered if her virtual office would be the same. OLIVEIRA: OK, follow me. ARGUELLES: So the first time that I met Thu, it was actually in a Google Meet meeting, and it was there that she told me, OK, let's go to our Gather office. Sorry, it took me some time. I was choosing my avatar. She has a very tiny avatar, dark short hair and big glasses. OLIVEIRA: It's me. It's my virtual me. WARNER: Full disclosure - we learned about Thu's company, Weme, from the PR department at Gather, the hosting platform. We asked them for an example of a company that had successfully transitioned to a virtual office. And so it was interesting, the look of the Weme office - there are no pirate ships, no castles. It is neither vast nor high-concept nor vacant. ARGUELLES: So, Thu, where are we? OLIVEIRA: We are at my virtual coffee place. ARGUELLES: Thu built this cafe inside the Weme metaverse office. And this is, like, a group hangout spot where anyone can come. OLIVEIRA: Yes. You can get to know me a little more by looking at the details. We have a pride flag. There is a psychoanalysis couch over there. WARNER: And in this interview, you can hear she immediately starts messing with Pablo. OLIVEIRA: Yeah, if you press letter Z, you can dance. It's a nice thing to know. ARGUELLES: So right there in the middle of the office, her avatar starts twirling and shaking. WARNER: Pablo, did you push Z? ARGUELLES: No. My fingers froze. WARNER: And the meeting continues in this awkward vein - somewhere between a business meeting and a video game. ARGUELLES: Thu told me that the first two weeks using this metaverse office, it was chaos. OLIVEIRA: (Speaking Portuguese) Because so many distractions, so many distractions - we can dance, play the piano. Liv (ph), we are here. Look, there is a whale. WARNER: But after a while, Thu surprised herself with how she was behaving in this new space. ARGUELLES: For example, at one moment we were at her desk on the other side of the office, and I asked her, Thu, can we go back to the cafe? OLIVEIRA: I think Lara is using the coffee. ARGUELLES: And she tells me, actually, no, we can't go to my cafe because Lara, my colleague, is working there, and she's busy. We cannot just go in there and disturb her. OLIVEIRA: We can go to the beach. What do you think? ARGUELLES: (Laughter) We can go to the beach. I don't mind. OLIVEIRA: OK, let's go. Follow me. WARNER: As Pablo and Thu are heading to the beach, past pixelated tiki torches and coconuts and towels and umbrellas, Thu explains her virtual work self has given her an upgrade. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)OLIVEIRA: (Speaking Portuguese). WARNER: Now she can take one look at someone's avatar, see their status light and know if they're prank ready. OLIVEIRA: Yes. (Speaking Portuguese) Available or not. ARGUELLES: And she was saying like, hey, in the physical office, it's not that everybody has, like, a red sign or a green sign that says, I will laugh when you perform a prank on me or I will be angry. So. . . WARNER: (Laughter) That's so true. We don't walk around with red signs and green signs. We really should, I think. ARGUELLES: Yeah. So the simple change, it really has shifted Thu's work. And she told me she sees herself now as a much different worker in the metaverse compared to the physical office. Her pranks and jokes are still there. OLIVEIRA: Boo (laughter). ARGUELLES: But she's just much more aware of how and when they can work. WARNER: It's almost like her co-workers can decide how much Thu do they want in their workday, and that's changed how she works as well. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)WARNER: When we talk about our future in the virtual office, which is definitely an uncertain future, there are a lot of metaverse skeptics out there. The promise of the virtual office is usually pitched like this - it is going to be both convenient and communal. You're going to be able to hang out with others without having to deal with traffic. But for Thu, who is, she admits, one of the most sociable co-workers you'll ever meet, the additional benefit of the metaverse is not just about being closer to people. It's about being aware of them in a way that allows you to give them distance. They're more than just their status light. OLIVEIRA: Jeff is here. ARGUELLES: And she points to an avatar in the garden. OLIVEIRA: He's there at the garden. And I don't know where the hell Jeff is in the real world. I don't know. But I know Jeff is there, sitting in that garden, still working. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)WARNER: When Pablo and Thu arrive at the beach, they climb onto a simple wooden canoe. OLIVEIRA: Yes, I put the boat here. ARGUELLES: Do you come here often? OLIVEIRA: Yes. When I need to concentrate and make some harder tasks, I come here in my boat. ARGUELLES: And when I was there with Thu on the boat, I have to admit that I felt like I had found something I didn't even know I had lost as a worker. OLIVEIRA: It's not a work story with good numbers and good results but memories about your life. ARGUELLES: For example, now, like, we are in a boat in the beach. . . OLIVEIRA: (Laughter) Yes, yes. ARGUELLES: . . . Doing an interview in a boat. OLIVEIRA: Yes, that kind of memory. (SOUNDBITE OF NIC M NEVES' \"METAVERSE OASIS\")WARNER: Next week on @Work, what does it take to succeed in your home country? CHIBUNDU ONUZO: We've had a couple of conversations where you've basically called me a slacker. CHINAZA: So. . . ONUZO: You have. WARNER: The writer Chibundu Onuzo decides to figure out once and for all if she can succeed in Lagos with some advice from her big brother. ONUZO: Was there any incident that made you think, gosh, I wish I hadn't moved back to Nigeria? CHINAZA: No. Well, I mean, OK, I take that back.

From ROUGH TRANSLATION. (SOUNDBITE OF NIC M NEVES' \"METAVERSE OASIS\") GREGORY WARNER, HOST:   You're listening to ROUGH TRANSLATION from NPR. Who of us has not fantasized about leaving work fully at work, having the freedom not to worry about that email or that boss when you're spending time with family or friends? There's this show on Apple TV+ called \"Severance. \" You might have heard of it. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"SEVERANCE\") BRITT LOWER: (As Helly Riggs) So I'll never leave here. ADAM SCOTT: (As Mark Scout) You'll leave at 5. WARNER: It takes that fantasy to a kind of terrifying extreme. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"SEVERANCE\") SCOTT: (As Mark Scout) But it won't feel like it, not to this version of you anyway. WARNER: The premise of the show is that a company called Lumon has found ways to let employees surgically separate their work memories from their outside-work memories. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"SEVERANCE\") LOWER: (As Helly Riggs) Do I have a family? SCOTT: (As Mark Scout) You'll never know. WARNER: This is a voluntary procedure. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"SEVERANCE\") SCOTT: (As Mark Scout) Well, every time you find yourself here, it's because you chose to come back. WARNER: So their outie (ph), or their outside work self, has no idea what they do at work all day, and their innie (ph) has no clue how they spend their free time. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"SEVERANCE\") LOWER: (As Helly Riggs) I have no choice. WARNER: And this weird thing quickly happens where their innie and their outie split off into completely different personalities. It's something that a lot of you told us you recognize. SEAN: I'm a completely different person at work. I keep to a very specific script of watercooler talk. KATTIA: As a woman, I had to be very tough and very serious. ALLINA: And so having to wear slacks and a button down and not be able to have any piercings and not be able to have tattoos and not be able to dye your hair does start to affect how you present yourself. WARNER: We asked you about your work self. Is it you? NOELLE: My work self is really similar to my out of work self. ANNALIESE: My work self is less direct. ALLINA: And because we spend so much time at work, I see it bleeding into my personal life. WARNER: And you told us that bringing your true self to work, it can be an act of resistance. . . ANNALIESE: It feels good to be good at your job. But it is just a job to me. WARNER: . . . Or exhaustion. CHELSEA: I got tired of trying to separate and manage work Chelsea from home Chelsea from church Chelsea and karaoke Chelsea. WARNER: This is ROUGH TRANSLATION. I'm Gregory Warner. Today on the show, two stories about that gap between your work self and your outside-work self, two stories where someone takes on an innie that they do not quite recognize, that feels almost like a stranger, but that shows them something about the person they did not think they could be. In one story, that work self is a new name; in another, a new body. You're at work with ROUGH TRANSLATION, back after this break. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) WARNER: We are back now with ROUGH TRANSLATION. I'm Gregory Warner. What is in a name? It is an age-old question. If you're a star-crossed lover in a Shakespeare play, your family name is the thing that keeps you apart. In our next story, the name you're given at work, it keeps you apart from yourself. And here to explain all that. . . SE EUN GONG, BYLINE: Yeah, it's brewing now. WARNER: . . . Se Eun Gong. GONG: Hi, Gregory. WARNER: So how are you feeling? GONG: Nervous (laughter). WARNER: If you've heard an NPR story out of South Korea for the past four years, Se Eun likely had a hand in it. She is a journalist in NPR's bureau in Seoul, though she's usually working behind the scenes instead of in front of the mic. GONG: Yeah, I'll - (laughter) I'll try my best. WARNER: So if we were speaking Korean right now and if we were in the same office and I just addressed you as Se Eun, which is what I call you. . . GONG: Right. WARNER: . . . Would that be a problem? And who's - like, who would it be awkward for? GONG: Well, in this context, you are senior in age and work experience. It's OK for someone higher up to address someone lower. So if you are calling me just Se Eun, that's perfectly fine. If we were Korean speakers and I would call you Gregory, that would be considered unusual. WARNER: Unusual? GONG: It just - it feels rude. WARNER: South Korean businesses are respectful of these hierarchies of age and experience, but they can also create a climate of silence that squelch good ideas and free-flowing communication. A 2017 survey by the Korean Chamber of Commerce found that nearly 70% of Korean corporate workers don't actively voice their opinions at meetings. GONG: Younger workers would feel like they cannot raise objections to bad ideas of their bosses for fear that they can be seen as presumptuous. WARNER: And your name is part of that. How people greet you marks your relative age and rank. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GONG: English nicknames - it's a helpful trick. WARNER: And so there is a growing trend in South Korea - it began with tech startups, but it spread to other industries - to change the names that people use at work. GONG: Yeah, a lot of job postings will advertise the fact that they use English nicknames. WARNER: Oh, so like, hey, we pay well, we offer good benefits, we use English nicknames? GONG: Yeah. WARNER: These are Korean-speaking workplaces where you go by a single English first name. And the idea is that instead of having to adjust what you call someone based on their rank or age, everyone in the company would be on a first-name basis. GONG: I mean, I, for one, was initially skeptical how effective this would be. I suspected that it would be not much more than window dressing. So I met this person. . . SHIN HYE JEE: (Speaking Korean). GONG: Shin Hye Jee. SHIN: (Speaking Korean). GONG: She's a 27-year-old woman who works at a startup accelerator. So she learned about the company's English nickname policy during her onboarding process. WARNER: So, yeah, so she shows up at her first day of work, and what happens? GONG: She gets there, and then she went into a meeting where the head of the company attended. WARNER: Wow, right away. GONG: Yeah. WARNER: She meets her new colleagues, a bunch of Daves and Carols and Sarahs and Susans. And the thing about using English nicknames is you don't attach someone's title. In her old job, Hye Jee used the standard Korean naming convention with titles attached. GONG: So she was called. . . SHIN: (Speaking Korean). GONG: Shin Hye Jee daeri neem - Shin Hye Jee, her full name, daeri, the title, and neem, the honorific. WARNER: So it would be like every time Se Eun greeted me, she had to say, Mr. Podcast Host Warner. Every time a co-worker told Hye Jee hello. . . SHIN: (Speaking Korean). WARNER: . . . Or goodbye. . . SHIN: (Speaking Korean). WARNER: The title followed her everywhere. So what is her title, actually? GONG: Daeri, daeri. Why don't I first explain the conventional titles in a company? At the top there's (speaking Korean), chairperson. Below (speaking Korean), there's (speaking Korean), president, (speaking Korean), director, (speaking Korean), division chief, (speaking Korean), deputy division chief, (speaking Korean), section chief, daeri, deputy section chief, which is Hye Jee's title - old title - and then (speaking Korean), the lowest. It's just staff. WARNER: Those titles disappear when people use English nicknames. Or at least they're supposed to. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"THE PLEASURES AND SORROWS OF WORK\") UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #1: (As David) I am David. UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #2: (As Andrew) I'm Andrew. WARNER: This is from a TV adaptation of a short story by Jang Ryujin. It's called \"The Pleasures And Sorrows Of Work,\" and one storyline follows a fictional Korean tech startup with an English nickname policy that gets totally misused. People start attaching the titles and the honorifics to the English nicknames. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"THE PLEASURES AND SORROWS OF WORK\") UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #3: (As character, speaking Korean). WARNER: And readers of the short story wrote in to say that, yes, they recognize this. Their company does the same thing. Despite the English nicknames, hierarchy reasserts itself. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"THE PLEASURES AND SORROWS OF WORK\") UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #1: (As character) Just like Silicon Valley. WARNER: So Hye Jee. . . GONG: She was a bit nervous about having to call the boss by just his first name. WARNER: She was extra cautious that first day on the job. GONG: She's the kind of person who, in that kind of setting, first watches how others do it. And she saw someone calling the head of the company by his English name. And then she realized, oh, like, this is really OK here to do that. WARNER: It took a few weeks, but she finally got used to it, chatting with the boss on a first-name basis. GONG: She felt like she was talking to him having shed the insignia. And this is a pretty commonplace expression in the Korean language, meaning that you're doing something free from the social hierarchy. WARNER: But using these new names - it didn't just change how she communicated with her bosses. It changed how she saw herself. SHIN: (Speaking Korean). GONG: She said she's thinking to herself when she arrives at the office that. . . SHIN: (Speaking Korean). GONG: . . . From here on, I'm not Shin Hye Jee, but I'm Hannah. SHIN: (Speaking Korean). GONG: She said her English name, Hannah, gives her a work persona. SHIN: (Speaking Korean). GONG: And that person, the Hannah, she thinks, is a braver version of herself. SHIN: (Speaking Korean). GONG: She would voice grievances to the head of the company with ease. It's something that she couldn't imagine doing in her previous workplace. WARNER: Where did this bravery come from? Was it just that the rules of behavior changed, or did this name allow something inside herself to be revealed? We called up one of the early adopters of this English name policy, JiHyun Won. He's the co-founder and COO of a video streaming company called Watcha. ALEX JIHYUN WON: At Watcha, I am not COO. I am Alex. GONG: Have you always had that name, Alex? WON: No, actually, no. I picked Alex as my English name because I am a big fan of the English football club Manchester United and their legendary manager. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER: The greatest British manager ever, Sir Alex Ferguson. (CHEERING) WON: Alex Ferguson. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) WARNER: He tells us about two years after they put in this English name policy, it came to the test. There was this intern who got really angry about all the problems in their code. WON: He was a software engineer. And he was mad. WARNER: The intern confronted the COO, but he didn't call him COO; he called him Alex. WON: He directly raised the problems in the company, and we listened to him, how we can fix them. So small changes can make big differences. WARNER: As a Korean startup, they have to compete with global players, like Netflix and Disney+. WON: A good idea deserves recognition, no matter what, and should not be overshadowed by hierarchy. WARNER: But these shadows of hierarchy can fall both ways. Alex, the COO, he's younger than many of his employees. GONG: And you may feel more comfortable talking to them as the boss, but as a younger boss, is that the case? WON: Yeah. We started to not remember people's age here. But in Korea, that is a big change. WARNER: Those older employees who he found it so awkward to talk to when he used their Korean names and titles, it actually changed how they saw him. They'd tell him. WON: Oh, you were younger than me. I didn't know that for two years. That is a big thing here, yeah. WARNER: They'll not only forget his age difference. WON: So we are confused sometimes that - what is your original name? Like, something like that. WARNER: (Laughter). WON: Hey, Alex, what's your name? Yeah. WARNER: Wait. Really? WON: Yeah. We don't - actually, we don't remember other colleagues' Korean name. So it's kind of weird, but yeah. WARNER: And this is a big reason, he says, why the English name policy is working for their company. It literally allows people to forget their old self, their more age- and rank-conscious self, at the office gates. WON: And that is why even big, major companies are adopting English name policies and abandoning their traditional position-first, title-first way of culture. So it's already becoming a trend. WARNER: That's interesting. So if a whole generation stops remembering people's ages - you're nodding. You're saying - does that sound like a good future to you? WON: Yes. The next generations, millennials and Gen Z, desire for a horizontal culture at the office. WARNER: But is it only at the office? Or might this relaxing of conventions inside the workplace lead to different behaviors outside as well? Alex hopes it will because, imagine, as English name policies become more and more common across Korean industries, will all those brave Hannahs and outspoken Andrews really stay meekly at the office? Or will they try, like the characters in \"Severance,\" to send secret messages to their outie? Does Alex and JiHyun, are they different for you? Are you a different person as Alex and different as JiHyun? WON: Yeah, I think different. I think JiHyun is more personal. And Alex - if someone called me Alex, then I feel like, OK, I'm working. WARNER: You can probably hear this in his voice, but as Alex is answering this, his shoulders slump, and he looks like a guy who's, well, imagining himself at work. WON: So I feel very different. WARNER: The freedom that he feels engaging with others as Alex is tempered with a kind of alienation. As Alex, he never feels like he's truly himself. Alex is a work identity, and therefore, Alex doesn't have parents. Alex doesn't have a childhood. But also, Alex doesn't have to negotiate his place in society as JiHyun might. WON: Korean language conveys a sense of hierarchy in its grammatical structure itself. So calling me Alex, it automatically gets rid of such feeling. WARNER: It's less formal, but it's less personal. WON: Yeah. Right. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) WARNER: And this impersonalness, this alienation of the work self, this is exactly what's allowed Hye Jee to explore this new side of herself. As Hannah, she finds herself reacting differently to how her colleagues treat her. SHIN: (Speaking Korean). GONG: If Hye Jee, her original identity, would look over something that's annoying her and just move on, when she's in the Hannah mode, she feels the anger building up in herself, and she would actually say what she needs to say to vent that anger. SHIN: (Speaking Korean). WARNER: Well, it's interesting just listening to you, and it's something so surprising. I'm trying to digest it. But I could maybe imagine that wearing a mask might allow me to behave differently. But the things that she would not notice, now she notices and make her angry. It's not just that she behaves differently, but she actually feels different. GONG: Yeah. I mean, you know, one definition of brave, I think, can be being honest about yourself and to yourself. If the Hye Jee personality would require that she suppress that kind of feelings and act in a way that's more socially acceptable, switching to Hannah, yeah, she gets free from that kind of burden. WARNER: That freedom, it ends with the end of the workday. . . SHIN: (Speaking Korean). WARNER: . . . Which is how Hye Jee wants it. GONG: Outside of work, she just wants to be Hye Jee, and it's not even a conscious effort because she's called Hannah only at work. SHIN: (Speaking Korean). WARNER: There's this scene in \"Severance\" where there's a kind of somber discussion about what might happen to innies if their outies find a new job. You can feel the powerlessness of being a work self in that moment, imagining that some person who is you, but a you you've never met, might decide to just pull the plug on your life. And then everything you know, the feel of your desk chair, the smell of the break room, that really banal office joke that that guy keeps repeating, all of that stuff, basically your whole world, will just cease to exist. And the part of you that is the only you that you know will just be gone. GONG: Even though she's experienced her Hannah self, if in future she goes to work at a different company that doesn't use English nicknames and has a strict hierarchy, she thinks she'll go back to the way she carried herself in her previous workplace. SHIN: (Speaking Korean). GONG: But then she'll think about Hannah for a long time, lamenting how she can't be that way anymore. SHIN: (Speaking Korean). WARNER: After the break, we suit up for a pixilated version of our work selves and enter the metaverse office, which can be a lonely place. PABLO ARGUELLES, BYLINE: It feels like I'm walking in these ghost towns. WARNER: But maybe it doesn't have to be. THU OLIVEIRA: Cuica? You know cuica? WARNER: When ROUGH TRANSLATION returns. We're back with ROUGH TRANSLATION. I'm Gregory Warner. And this next story about work selves and ourselves at work, it takes us to Campinas near Sao Paulo, Brazil. OLIVEIRA: Hi. Hello. Hi. Sound. One, two, three. WARNER: Thu Oliveira - spelled T-H-U - knows that some of her old coworkers used to roll their eyes at her pranks. OLIVEIRA: I don't know who I am without pranks. WARNER: She's the kind of coworker who would sneak up behind you. . . OLIVEIRA: (Speaking Portuguese). WARNER: . . . Crawling on the floor like a cat. . . OLIVEIRA: (Speaking Portuguese). WARNER: . . . And then. . . OLIVEIRA: Piff. Hi, Pablo. WARNER: Thu spoke to our producer, Pablo Arguelles. ARGUELLES: Thu says that sometimes in the office when she did these pranks - well, she uses this Portuguese expression, perder a mao. OLIVEIRA: Perder a mao in Portuguese is like when you cross the line because too many jokes, too many pranks, and then you stop and you think, oh, man, I really crossed the line here. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ARGUELLES: I get what she means because I think I'm the kind of worker who would painfully smile at her and never tell her, Thu, I think I need a little bit of space here. But she says that she could read it on people's faces sometimes. And yet she still did these pranks. . . OLIVEIRA: Of course. ARGUELLES: . . . Because to her they had a higher purpose. OLIVEIRA: Imagine you were having a bad day. ARGUELLES: And she's bringing joy to the office. OLIVEIRA: I think the energy can improve that, can make you forget, even for a moment, if you're having a bad day. ARGUELLES: So she would go around wishing everyone good morning. OLIVEIRA: (Speaking Portuguese). ARGUELLES: Almost like a ritual. OLIVEIRA: (Speaking Portuguese). ARGUELLES: And she would play music for you in the office. OLIVEIRA: A cuica. You know cuica? That's a samba instrument, yes. WARNER: But when the pandemic hit and Thu's company went remote, it was tough. ARGUELLES: She lives alone. She just had a break up. OLIVEIRA: (Speaking Portuguese). ARGUELLES: And she's working remotely, only seeing her dogs and cats. OLIVEIRA: (Speaking Portuguese). WARNER: She could see people's status light and their calendar availability. . . OLIVEIRA: Open a link. Close a link. Open a link. Close a link. WARNER: . . . But not actually have any shared experiences, not randomly bump into anyone or join them for a stroll. ARGUELLES: And when she try to do pranks on Zoom, obviously, they were followed by very uncomfortable silences. OLIVEIRA: Yes, yes, uncomfortable silence. It's so sad. It's so sad. WARNER: And the worrying part was that some of her co-workers seemed to prefer it this way. According to the 2022 State of Remote Work report by the social media management company Buffer, which surveyed more than 2,000 people from 16 countries, 97% of us - so basically everyone - would recommend remote work to others, but 52% said they felt less connected to their coworkers. Twenty-four percent felt more lonely. And Thu wondered, did her co-workers realize what they were missing? A chance to just have random memories of things happening at the office. OLIVEIRA: I don't know if they are work memories, but life memories even at work. ARGUELLES: What was the lowest point for you? OLIVEIRA: The lowest point - when I turned my computer off, and I was still at home. But when you - poof - power off, back to your reality, I think, oh, man, I'm still at home. WARNER: Thu felt herself losing focus. She spun out, and she left her job. She got hired as head of marketing at a design firm called Weme. And Weme said it was trying an experiment, a way they hoped would combine the convenience of remote work with the community of a real office. Everyone would log on from home and choose an avatar, and then the avatars would meet in a virtual platform called Gather. OLIVEIRA: How does it work? It's a metaverse? It's not a metaverse. It's a game? It seems like a game. ARGUELLES: The places look like an old video game, like Zelda or Pokemon. And they're very pixelated and two-dimensional. WARNER: Before we met Thu, we asked Pablo to check out these virtual co-working spaces around the world that use this Gather platform. And these were mostly public co-working spaces, as opposed to private offices. So anyone could enter. And because it's virtual, these places are all really different. Like, you can go to work in a super boring cubicle with a bunch of fluorescent lights, or you can file your papers in a pirate ship or a medieval castle. ARGUELLES: And then there's like a big forest, a very \"Lord Of The Rings\" kind of co-working place. So just imagine my tiny avatar there with my pixelated curly hair, big eyes, my set of headphones entering these spaces. And I went to one in Indonesia, one in South Korea, a couple of them in Brazil, one in Chile and one in the Czech Republic and a couple of American ones. And I just found them on the internet and dropped right in and started wandering around. But they were empty. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ARGUELLES: I remember that in one of these places, it was like a big city next to the ocean. The only sound that you could hear was the sound of the waves and of the seagulls. WARNER: Oh, my - it's so dystopic. It's so crazy. The background noise, the seagulls - (imitating seagull). ARGUELLES: (Laughter) Yeah. So imagine visiting all of these places - empty, like, really sad places, not a soul. So very frightening also. And I even found a place with a guest book, and I could see the comments that were left there. And one said this place was built by 20 people, but now it's a ghost town. WARNER: It seemed like the fate of so many digital gatherings - from watercooler channels on Slack to happy hours convened on Zoom. So many pandemic efforts intended to counter loneliness make us more lonely because so few people show up. Thu wondered if her virtual office would be the same. OLIVEIRA: OK, follow me. ARGUELLES: So the first time that I met Thu, it was actually in a Google Meet meeting, and it was there that she told me, OK, let's go to our Gather office. Sorry, it took me some time. I was choosing my avatar. She has a very tiny avatar, dark short hair and big glasses. OLIVEIRA: It's me. It's my virtual me. WARNER: Full disclosure - we learned about Thu's company, Weme, from the PR department at Gather, the hosting platform. We asked them for an example of a company that had successfully transitioned to a virtual office. And so it was interesting, the look of the Weme office - there are no pirate ships, no castles. It is neither vast nor high-concept nor vacant. ARGUELLES: So, Thu, where are we? OLIVEIRA: We are at my virtual coffee place. ARGUELLES: Thu built this cafe inside the Weme metaverse office. And this is, like, a group hangout spot where anyone can come. OLIVEIRA: Yes. You can get to know me a little more by looking at the details. We have a pride flag. There is a psychoanalysis couch over there. WARNER: And in this interview, you can hear she immediately starts messing with Pablo. OLIVEIRA: Yeah, if you press letter Z, you can dance. It's a nice thing to know. ARGUELLES: So right there in the middle of the office, her avatar starts twirling and shaking. WARNER: Pablo, did you push Z? ARGUELLES: No. My fingers froze. WARNER: And the meeting continues in this awkward vein - somewhere between a business meeting and a video game. ARGUELLES: Thu told me that the first two weeks using this metaverse office, it was chaos. OLIVEIRA: (Speaking Portuguese) Because so many distractions, so many distractions - we can dance, play the piano. Liv (ph), we are here. Look, there is a whale. WARNER: But after a while, Thu surprised herself with how she was behaving in this new space. ARGUELLES: For example, at one moment we were at her desk on the other side of the office, and I asked her, Thu, can we go back to the cafe? OLIVEIRA: I think Lara is using the coffee. ARGUELLES: And she tells me, actually, no, we can't go to my cafe because Lara, my colleague, is working there, and she's busy. We cannot just go in there and disturb her. OLIVEIRA: We can go to the beach. What do you think? ARGUELLES: (Laughter) We can go to the beach. I don't mind. OLIVEIRA: OK, let's go. Follow me. WARNER: As Pablo and Thu are heading to the beach, past pixelated tiki torches and coconuts and towels and umbrellas, Thu explains her virtual work self has given her an upgrade. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) OLIVEIRA: (Speaking Portuguese). WARNER: Now she can take one look at someone's avatar, see their status light and know if they're prank ready. OLIVEIRA: Yes. (Speaking Portuguese) Available or not. ARGUELLES: And she was saying like, hey, in the physical office, it's not that everybody has, like, a red sign or a green sign that says, I will laugh when you perform a prank on me or I will be angry. So. . . WARNER: (Laughter) That's so true. We don't walk around with red signs and green signs. We really should, I think. ARGUELLES: Yeah. So the simple change, it really has shifted Thu's work. And she told me she sees herself now as a much different worker in the metaverse compared to the physical office. Her pranks and jokes are still there. OLIVEIRA: Boo (laughter). ARGUELLES: But she's just much more aware of how and when they can work. WARNER: It's almost like her co-workers can decide how much Thu do they want in their workday, and that's changed how she works as well. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) WARNER: When we talk about our future in the virtual office, which is definitely an uncertain future, there are a lot of metaverse skeptics out there. The promise of the virtual office is usually pitched like this - it is going to be both convenient and communal. You're going to be able to hang out with others without having to deal with traffic. But for Thu, who is, she admits, one of the most sociable co-workers you'll ever meet, the additional benefit of the metaverse is not just about being closer to people. It's about being aware of them in a way that allows you to give them distance. They're more than just their status light. OLIVEIRA: Jeff is here. ARGUELLES: And she points to an avatar in the garden. OLIVEIRA: He's there at the garden. And I don't know where the hell Jeff is in the real world. I don't know. But I know Jeff is there, sitting in that garden, still working. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) WARNER: When Pablo and Thu arrive at the beach, they climb onto a simple wooden canoe. OLIVEIRA: Yes, I put the boat here. ARGUELLES: Do you come here often? OLIVEIRA: Yes. When I need to concentrate and make some harder tasks, I come here in my boat. ARGUELLES: And when I was there with Thu on the boat, I have to admit that I felt like I had found something I didn't even know I had lost as a worker. OLIVEIRA: It's not a work story with good numbers and good results but memories about your life. ARGUELLES: For example, now, like, we are in a boat in the beach. . . OLIVEIRA: (Laughter) Yes, yes. ARGUELLES: . . . Doing an interview in a boat. OLIVEIRA: Yes, that kind of memory. (SOUNDBITE OF NIC M NEVES' \"METAVERSE OASIS\") WARNER: Next week on @Work, what does it take to succeed in your home country? CHIBUNDU ONUZO: We've had a couple of conversations where you've basically called me a slacker. CHINAZA: So. . . ONUZO: You have. WARNER: The writer Chibundu Onuzo decides to figure out once and for all if she can succeed in Lagos with some advice from her big brother. ONUZO: Was there any incident that made you think, gosh, I wish I hadn't moved back to Nigeria? CHINAZA: No. Well, I mean, OK, I take that back.

According to some privacy experts, that is now a real possibility. NPR's Bobby Allyn looked into how our digital lives could be transformed in a post-Roe world. BOBBY ALLYN, BYLINE: The Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade has privacy experts on edge. While we don't yet know how exactly state prosecutors might enforce abortion bans, it is theoretically possible that some states could start investigating women suspected of having sought abortions. If that happens, the phone activity of women could be the first target, says Elisa Wells. She's the co-founder of the abortion rights group Plan C. ELISA WELLS: Have you gone to a website and looked up how to get abortion pills online? Have you made an order online? Those sorts of things are records that can be gathered in the course of somebody building a case against you. ALLYN: And this is not purely hypothetical. There's at least one example from 2018 where a Mississippi woman's Google history searching for abortion pills was part of the evidence prosecutors used against her in a second-degree murder case after having a stillbirth. The case was eventually dropped. The National Advocates for Pregnant Women represented the woman in the case. Dana Sussman with the group says she expects these kinds of cases to now become more common. DANA SUSSMAN: We only have a couple of cases we can point to right now that provide sort of a guide for what may be to come. But I do think that the digital footprint is going to be everything. ALLYN: Digital records are routinely part of criminal prosecutions in other types of cases. And when authorities ask for it, big tech companies usually hand over the data they collect about users. But before that, police could try to get a suspect to willingly hand over their phone. Sussman says she will be telling women not to do this. SUSSMAN: The harder it is to get the information, the more work they have to do, the less likely it is that they will move ahead with prosecutions. ALLYN: One big question, though, is how tech companies will respond if law enforcement make requests aimed at women seeking abortions. Google, Facebook parent Meta, Apple, Twitter and Amazon did not respond to requests for comment about this. SHIRIN MORI: It's deeply concerning that they haven't yet decided how they want to stand with their users. ALLYN: That's Shirin Mori, who works on digital security at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. She says one major thing tech companies can do to protect women right now is to offer an option in which people can, say, search, buy things and use social media without it being tied back to them. MORI: So it's really important that they make it possible for people to access their services without being signed in, for example, or without being tracked. ALLYN: Privacy experts are not only worried about how the Googles and Facebooks of the world will respond to requests from authorities but also companies known as data brokers that buy and sell people's data for advertisers. This often includes location data. Also causing some concern are apps that help women track their periods. Some of those apps are now redesigning their services to ensure their data is anonymous. Farah Diaz-Tello is a lawyer with the reproductive rights group If/When/How. She says of course authorities can't monitor what people are doing on their phones at all times. It's only when someone is under investigation. FARAH DIAZ-TELLO: Once that happens, then their digital footprint - you know, what's on their phone, what's on their computer, these sorts of things - then becomes a part of the criminal investigation. ALLYN: Still, she says, women living in states where abortion is illegal or highly restricted need to be asking themselves some questions. DIAZ-TELLO: What data are we creating? Who owns those data? How do we control them or not? ALLYN: And experts say there are ways to better control your data - using encrypted messaging services like Signal, privacy-focused web browsers, turning off location sharing on apps so your travels don't leave behind digital breadcrumbs. And then there's another option privacy experts suggest. If you're going someplace you want to keep private, turn off your phone, or keep it at home. Bobby Allyn, NPR News.

But some federal officials and security experts have been worried for years about how the app's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, handles personal data. Now TikTok is facing new scrutiny from the senior Republican on the Federal Communications Commission. FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr is urging Google and Apple to remove TikTok from their digital stores. Commissioner Carr joins us now. Thank you so much for being on the show. BRENDAN CARR: Great to be with you. Thank you. MARTIN: You say it's time for Americans to delete TikTok. This has something to do with privacy. Explain why you think that this particular app is so dangerous. CARR: Yeah. A lot of people look at it. And they say, well, it's just an app for sharing funny videos or memes. And the reality is, that's just the sheep's clothing. If you look in terms of the actual data that this app is pulling, it's really sweeping. It's looking at everything from search and browsing history, your keystroke patterns, biometric data, including face print and voice print - the face print stuff being things that could be used in facial recognition down the road - draft messages. And while we were told by TikTok that all this data is stored in the U. S. , there are some new reports just the last few weeks that showed that a tremendous amount of this data is being accessed by engineers in Beijing who work for a company, ByteDance, that is beholden to the CCP. And so I think that's really disturbing. It's a national security threat, in my view. But short of that, it looks to me that it's a violation of the app store policies of Google and Apple. And that's why I wrote them saying they should enforce their policies and boot the app from the app store on that basis. MARTIN: OK. So let's back up a second. You referenced this revelation that TikTok employees in China were accessing American users' personal information. TikTok then said that it moved Americans' data to servers based, through Oracle, in the U. S. Why do you think that's still insufficient? What's your evidence that that's not working? CARR: Yes, that's a good question. Two things - one, up to now, they've been maintaining basically the same thing. They say all of the data is stored in the U. S. To your point, they're saying they're now moving it to an Oracle base infrastructure in the U. S. But they've been representing for a long time that it's stored in the U. S. The question is, where is it accessed? And even though they're switching to Oracle, U. S. -based, cloud-based services, it's still going to be accessed in Beijing. In fact, they came out and said that, well, of course, some of the data is accessed there. But it's only on an as-needed basis. And the definition of as needed when it comes to entities beholden to the CCP is very, very different than, I think, what you or I would conceive of in terms of as needed. So that's the concern there. Also, again, with the representation that it's stored here - these leaked audios from internal TikTok meetings show people saying, quote, \"everything is seen in China,\" end quote. MARTIN: And this was a BuzzFeed report from earlier this month, we should say. So you know, we need to point out, you're the sole FCC commissioner who signed this letter calling on Google and Apple to take TikTok from their app stores. Where are your fellow commissioners on this? CARR: You know, I've just started talking to one or two of them. And so we'll see where they come down. This isn't the type of thing that is in our core, you know, direct regulatory jurisdiction. So for instance, we've taken action on Huawei and ZTE. We've taken action on China Mobile and China Telecom, looking at their licenses. Those are entities that are directly licensed by the FCC or get funding from the FCC. So our core regulatory authority there is very clear. For me, this is more taking a look at our expertise that we're developing - or I'm developing with respect to influence from entities beholden to the CCP in our communication system generally. And so that's why my letter to them is not about an FCC rule or license. It's about their app store policies because if you look, they've enforced those policies before on companies that have surreptitiously taken data and moved it to China. They've done it against companies that are engaging in unauthorized uses and practices of data. So my question is, basically, put the national security stuff to the side, which I think we should be looking at. But just apply your app store policies on its terms. And it looks to me that that's enough to move them out of the app store. MARTIN: Although, is that within your writ? I mean, the FCC doesn't regulate app stores. CARR: Yeah. It's not necessarily in terms of a license that we would revoke or a regulation in that sense. It is in the sense that it has to do with our expertise that we've developed with influence campaigns from entities that are beholden to CCP. But at the end of the day, you know, I'm just one shoe to drop of others. The Biden administration itself is taking a look at this app, along with other apps, as part of a broader review of foreign influence that's taking place in Commerce Department. In Congress, there's bipartisan interest. Senator Schumer and Senator Cotton joined a letter looking at this. Adam Schiff, Ted Cruz, Marsha Blackburn, so. . . MARTIN: Lots of interest, clearly. I just want to ask very quickly, have you heard from Google and Apple? CARR: I've not heard back yet. I've asked them to respond by July 8 and tell me either, A, yeah, we agree. We're going to remove it from the app store. Or, two, we're not going to. And we don't think it's a violation of our policies, and here's why we don't. And I look forward to hearing from them on that. MARTIN: Brendan Carr is a commissioner with the Federal Communications Commission. Thanks for your time. CARR: Appreciate it. Thank you.

It showed him calling on his soldiers to surrender to Russia. But that never happened. The video was a deepfake. These are images or recordings that have been manipulated to misrepresent someone's actions or words. And the fake video of Zelenskyy wasn't that well made, but it got traction after hackers managed to get it briefly on Ukrainian television and the broadcaster's website. As technology evolves, experts warn deepfakes will become harder to spot and even further undermine public trust. Hany Farid is a professor at the University of California, Berkeley and a digital forensics expert. He joins me now. Welcome, Hany. HANY FARID: Good to be with you again, Shannon. BOND: Just how good is the technology to make these kinds of images, videos, other things right now? FARID: I've been studying manipulated media for over 20 years now. And what I've seen over the 20 years is every few years, the technology gets better and better for manipulating media. But I've never seen anything like the last five years, where we now can whole-cloth synthesize an audio in your voice, a video of you saying and doing something you never did. And what is really dramatic about this technology is that we have democratized access to what used to be in the hands of Hollywood studios and state-sponsored actors to now anybody can generate this. And that's a very different threat factor in terms of disinformation campaigns meant to sow civil unrest, interfere with democratic elections. Every few months, we see more and more advances that are really dramatic and exciting in some - on one hand and worrisome in the other hand. BOND: Can you give an example of one of these? FARID: Yeah. My favorite recent one is the work from OpenAI called DALL-E. It has taken the internet by storm over the last few weeks. It is what is called a paint-by-text. And the way it works is you go to the website and you just type in, make me an image of a squirrel wearing a life jacket surfing in the Atlantic Ocean. And - anything in your head. And it will make an image that is eerily pertinent to that. And that is really impressive. But you can also see why that can be incredibly dangerous. And, of course, when we then are able to do that, not just for images but for audio, now you're looking at potential real challenges for discerning what is real and what is fake on the internet. BOND: You have also talked about another risk that actually - as this technology is more democratized and accessible, you actually don't have to go down the road to make that fake video. . . FARID: Yeah. BOND: . . . Or picture to inject out. Can you explain this idea? FARID: I think this is what keeps me up at night more than the actual fake content. If we enter a world where any story, any audio recording, any image, any video can be fake, well, then nothing has to be real. We can simply dismiss inconvenient facts. A video showing police violence - it's fake. A video of human rights violations - it's fake. A video of a candidate saying something offensive - it's fake. How, then, do we reason about the world? If everything can be manipulated, how do we get news in a trusted way? And that - long term, that is what really worries me. BOND: How do you approach kind of peering around the corner and preparing for what's coming next, whether it's DALL-E, like, generated videos or live videos that are faked? I guess, how are you approaching these problems? FARID: We shouldn't think about where the problem is today. We should think about where the problem is tomorrow. And I can tell you that we are going to enter a time when these deepfake videos and images and audio start to become more prevalent in disinformation campaigns. And the hope is that we can get out ahead of that - not to stop it, but to mitigate it. The only hope we have is to develop technology that takes it out of the hands of the amateurs, the average person on the internet, and makes it more difficult, more time-consuming, more risky to produce these. But we should acknowledge that it's always going to be possible to create fake media. BOND: Well, but as you say, these are technologies that have essentially become democratized, that people do have access to. So, I mean, what does that mean? Is there a regulatory response here? Is it on the companies themselves that are developing these technologies to, you know, decide how to police their use? FARID: I think the fact is that the regulatory regime moves way too slowly. Members of the U. S. Congress are simply not sophisticated enough, frankly, to understand the complexity in these technologies. I want to see companies have some reasonably strong guardrails to prevent abuse. But here's what we know. No matter how good the top companies are, there's going to be a bad actor in this space. And the bad actor's going to get a hold of that technology. And we've already seen that in the form of non-consensual sexual imagery. BOND: Revenge porn. FARID: Exactly, revenge porn. The worst example use case of deepfakes is now absolutely everywhere. In the technology sector, we often ask if we can do something, and I think that we should start asking, should we do something? Because the fact is, once you develop these technologies, there is no controlling them. And I think a lot of researchers are developing technologies because they can and not necessarily because they should. If the downsides of a technology are so much greater than the upsides, maybe we shouldn't be developing these technologies in the first place. BOND: So for listeners out there who are just living their lives, you know, browsing the internet, how worried should they be about this problem right now? FARID: I think they should be worried about disinformation generally. The internet is awash with nonsense and lies and conspiracies beyond the deepfakes. And I think that if you are somebody who is getting the majority of - if we can call it this - news from social media, you should stop. I think people should start to grow weary about being lied to and being manipulated every minute of every day and return to the trusted sources so that we can have honest conversations about what's going on in the world. BOND: Hany Farid, professor at the University of California, Berkeley, thanks so much for joining us. FARID: Great talking to you, Shannon.

BOND: Just how good is the technology to make these kinds of images, videos, other things right now? FARID: I've been studying manipulated media for over 20 years now. And what I've seen over the 20 years is every few years, the technology gets better and better for manipulating media. But I've never seen anything like the last five years, where we now can whole-cloth synthesize an audio in your voice, a video of you saying and doing something you never did. And what is really dramatic about this technology is that we have democratized access to what used to be in the hands of Hollywood studios and state-sponsored actors to now anybody can generate this. And that's a very different threat factor in terms of disinformation campaigns meant to sow civil unrest, interfere with democratic elections. Every few months, we see more and more advances that are really dramatic and exciting in some - on one hand and worrisome in the other hand. BOND: Can you give an example of one of these? FARID: Yeah. My favorite recent one is the work from OpenAI called DALL-E. It has taken the internet by storm over the last few weeks. It is what is called a paint-by-text. And the way it works is you go to the website and you just type in, make me an image of a squirrel wearing a life jacket surfing in the Atlantic Ocean. And - anything in your head. And it will make an image that is eerily pertinent to that. And that is really impressive. But you can also see why that can be incredibly dangerous. And, of course, when we then are able to do that, not just for images but for audio, now you're looking at potential real challenges for discerning what is real and what is fake on the internet. BOND: You have also talked about another risk that actually - as this technology is more democratized and accessible, you actually don't have to go down the road to make that fake video. . . FARID: Yeah. BOND: . . . Or picture to inject out. Can you explain this idea? FARID: I think this is what keeps me up at night more than the actual fake content. If we enter a world where any story, any audio recording, any image, any video can be fake, well, then nothing has to be real. We can simply dismiss inconvenient facts. A video showing police violence - it's fake. A video of human rights violations - it's fake. A video of a candidate saying something offensive - it's fake. How, then, do we reason about the world? If everything can be manipulated, how do we get news in a trusted way? And that - long term, that is what really worries me. BOND: How do you approach kind of peering around the corner and preparing for what's coming next, whether it's DALL-E, like, generated videos or live videos that are faked? I guess, how are you approaching these problems? FARID: We shouldn't think about where the problem is today. We should think about where the problem is tomorrow. And I can tell you that we are going to enter a time when these deepfake videos and images and audio start to become more prevalent in disinformation campaigns. And the hope is that we can get out ahead of that - not to stop it, but to mitigate it. The only hope we have is to develop technology that takes it out of the hands of the amateurs, the average person on the internet, and makes it more difficult, more time-consuming, more risky to produce these. But we should acknowledge that it's always going to be possible to create fake media. BOND: Well, but as you say, these are technologies that have essentially become democratized, that people do have access to. So, I mean, what does that mean? Is there a regulatory response here? Is it on the companies themselves that are developing these technologies to, you know, decide how to police their use? FARID: I think the fact is that the regulatory regime moves way too slowly. Members of the U. S. Congress are simply not sophisticated enough, frankly, to understand the complexity in these technologies. I want to see companies have some reasonably strong guardrails to prevent abuse. But here's what we know. No matter how good the top companies are, there's going to be a bad actor in this space. And the bad actor's going to get a hold of that technology. And we've already seen that in the form of non-consensual sexual imagery. BOND: Revenge porn. FARID: Exactly, revenge porn. The worst example use case of deepfakes is now absolutely everywhere. In the technology sector, we often ask if we can do something, and I think that we should start asking, should we do something? Because the fact is, once you develop these technologies, there is no controlling them. And I think a lot of researchers are developing technologies because they can and not necessarily because they should. If the downsides of a technology are so much greater than the upsides, maybe we shouldn't be developing these technologies in the first place. BOND: So for listeners out there who are just living their lives, you know, browsing the internet, how worried should they be about this problem right now? FARID: I think they should be worried about disinformation generally. The internet is awash with nonsense and lies and conspiracies beyond the deepfakes. And I think that if you are somebody who is getting the majority of - if we can call it this - news from social media, you should stop. I think people should start to grow weary about being lied to and being manipulated every minute of every day and return to the trusted sources so that we can have honest conversations about what's going on in the world. BOND: Hany Farid, professor at the University of California, Berkeley, thanks so much for joining us. FARID: Great talking to you, Shannon.

MATT BLOOM, BYLINE: Graham Hill is sitting at a computer overlooking a big grassy field in suburban Denver, where he's just finished setting up a small army of drones for takeoff. There's 20 to be exact, each about the size of toy cars with four propeller blades. HILL: We're looking good on the map. BLOOM: They're arranged in a five-by-four grid on the ground, each fixed with a lightbulb that's currently flashing a bright blue color in unison. When they finish syncing together, they start beeping. (SOUNDBITE OF DRONES BEEPING)BLOOM: Hill then presses the spacebar on his laptop, and. . . (SOUNDBITE OF DRONES WHIRRING)BLOOM: They take off into the sky in perfect synchronization. Once they're about 50 feet up, their lights change to different colors of the rainbow and float around to form different shapes in midair. HILL: So we've got, like, a diamond shape and then a circle shape. We're standing almost right under it. And so sometimes it can look like they're about to hit each other, but they're actually all about 10 feet apart at all times. BLOOM: Hill's Colorado-based company, Hire UAV Pro, puts on drone shows all over the world. It's still a niche industry but growing fast, Hill says. Communities from Colorado to California have hired his team to design patriotic shows to replace their traditional fireworks. They've gotten more requests than they could handle this year from places concerned about fire danger, from Idaho to New Mexico to Texas. HILL: As soon as we turned on our website and started advertising and putting a couple of videos out there, it's - I mean, we probably had like 300, 400 requests for the Fourth of July. BLOOM: The shows only last about 15 minutes due to limited battery life. Jeremy Gross, an event coordinator with the town of Vail, says they spent about $100,000 on this year's show - three times more than fireworks would cost. JEREMY GROSS: It does take a commitment from the communities that are making this change to step up to the plate and spend that money to reduce the risk and provide a new and creative experience. BLOOM: They're worth it, Gross says, because they're less likely to start a catastrophic wildfire and less prone to last-minute cancellations due to high fire danger. Plus, they can make formations that people likely haven't seen before. GROSS: You can put an eagle in the sky, and the eagle actually flaps its wings. You know, the Old Glory - when you put the flag up, it waves, and it, you know, moves and can transition. BLOOM: Some towns, though, are sticking with traditional fireworks, but with additional safety precautions. Estes Park, on the outskirts of Rocky Mountain National Park, is shooting their fireworks over a large lake as a safety measure, says town spokeswoman Kate Rusch. KATE RUSCH: I feel lucky that we have a large body of water. That's a big deal for us. BLOOM: Back at the July 4th show rehearsal, Graham Hill wraps up his test flight. HILL: It feels good every time. BLOOM: He says he only sees demand going up as communities look for ways to adapt to a drier climate, even if the shows are missing some of the traditional elements of fireworks, like the loud booms and a big, bright finale. HILL: We're like the iPhone One of drone light shows right now. And I expect in five years, we're going to be able to do a near-hour-long drone show. BLOOM: They will still have his favorite part, though - the music. He's personally excited to see the drones form the letters U-S-A in red, white and blue as Ray Charles' version of \"America The Beautiful\" plays in the background.

CONK: Growing up, I never really ate too much Korean food because I'm an adoptee. SUMMERS: But that changed in college. CONK: That was my opportunity of meeting other Korean - what we call Korean-Korean people. CHANG: And he learned how to cook the cuisine by watching chefs on YouTube, like Chef Chris Cho. (SOUNDBITE OF YOUTUBE VIDEO)CHRIS CHO: Hey, what's up y'all? It's your boy, Chef Chris Cho. CHANG: Conk says Cho's recipe for kimchi fried rice inspired his own. But Conk did put his own spin on things, which some people had questions about. CONK: They're like, why unsalted butter? And I'm like, it allows you to salt to taste. And the goal of butter is to bring out the subtle nuances of kimchi. SUMMERS: Now, the original playlist did not include the song \"Butter\" by South Korean boyband BTS. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"BUTTER\")BTS: (Singing) Smooth like butter, like a criminal undercover. CONK: I realized I was like, how could I forget the \"Butter\" song, like, in a kimchi fried rice recipe playlist? SUMMERS: He's since updated that playlist to correct that oversight. CHANG: Conk's musical recipe has more than 4,000 likes. And after the songs top off with \"Sesame Seeds,\" the playlist ends with the song \"Winners Circle\" by Anderson . Paak.

The billionaire has written a letter to the social media company, accusing it of not being upfront about the amount of fake and spam accounts, or bots, on the platform. He says the company has refused to give him the information that he says he needs. But can he really scuttle the $44 billion deal? Well, to help us answer that question, we're joined now by NPR tech correspondent Shannon Bond. Hi, Shannon. SHANNON BOND, BYLINE: Hi, Ailsa. CHANG: OK. So what exactly did Elon Musk say in this letter to Twitter today? BOND: Well, he accused Twitter of making, quote, \"false and misleading representations. \" And what he's referring to is this ongoing dispute you mentioned that he's had with the company over fake accounts. So Twitter has long said that less than 5% of accounts on the platform are fake or spam. But Musk thinks that number is much higher, and he says Twitter has refused to give him the data and information that he says he needs to verify the company's estimates. And so in this letter today, he says this is grounds for calling the whole thing off. CHANG: Wow. I mean, it seems kind of weird that Musk would break off this huge deal based on the number of bots. Like, is there more to it than that in real life? BOND: Yeah. And, I mean, almost since this deal was announced back in April, when - remember, one of the things he said about buying Twitter was that he wanted to clean up the spam and bot problem. CHANG: Yeah. BOND: Musk has hinted, if not just come out and said outright, that he has cold feet about this deal. And bots really are only part of it. It seems pretty clear at this point. Back in April, Musk agreed to pay $54. 20 a share for Twitter, and that seemed like maybe a low price at the time. Twitter had been trading much higher just a year ago. But since then, the market has tanked. Tech stocks, including Twitter, are way down, and that has fueled speculation that Musk may feel like he's now overpaying for the company. And he even said back in May he might try to cut the price he's going to pay. But what he's made clear today is he doesn't want to buy Twitter at all. CHANG: So what's the response from Twitter? BOND: Well, the company's board chair, Bret Taylor, tweeted almost right away that Twitter is committed to closing the deal on the terms and at the price agreed and that it is going to take Musk to court to do so. And legal experts I spoke with say Twitter has a strong case. The legal agreement Musk signed says Twitter can take Musk to court - they can sue him to try to force him to complete the deal as long as his financing is in place. There's also a provision in this agreement calling for Musk to pay a billion-dollar breakup fee. . . CHANG: (Laughter). BOND: . . . To Twitter if he walks away, you know, without a very sort of limited amount of reasons. But the experts I spoke to said, look, he could be on the hook for a lot more money if a court finds that actually he's the one that's breached the obligations. . . CHANG: Yeah. BOND: . . . In this agreement. CHANG: Yeah. OK. So legally speaking, it sounds like Twitter has a good case. But what does this kind of news do to the company? BOND: Yeah. I mean, it is going to be a protracted battle if it does go to court. It would go to court in Delaware. And, you know, that's just going to create a lot of uncertainty for the company and for employees who are already feeling very uncertain. You know, there's this big cloud hanging over with this - all of the antics around this deal, all of the uncertainty. You know, there's a hiring freeze in place. There are spending cuts.

It hands over emails, location history, search data. It has all kinds of information about you. So how will Google respond when authorities ask for details about people seeking abortions in places where it's now illegal? NPR tech reporter Bobby Allyn reports. BOBBY ALLYN, BYLINE: When police are trying to solve a crime, they often turn to Google for help. If you're using a Google app on your phone with location history enabled, here's what you need to know. Google is logging your phone's position about every 2 minutes. It stores it in a big database in the cloud. It also holds onto everyone's Google search histories. In the first half of last year, law enforcement sent the company more than 50,000 subpoenas, search warrants and other type of legal requests to turn this data into criminal investigations. ALBERT FOX CAHN: Google is increasingly the cornerstone of American policing. ALLYN: That's Albert Fox Cahn. He's a lawyer who runs the group Surveillance Technology Oversight Project. He says there are two types of search techniques that are particularly troubling. One, police are able to obtain every person who has entered a certain location. That's called a geo-fence warrant. And two, authorities can get a list of every person who has, say, Googled an address in the past two weeks, something called a keyword search warrant. CAHN: This is the equivalent of going to a library and then trying to search every person who checked out a specific book. ALLYN: It's not clear whether state authorities will try to prosecute people who seek abortions, but in other types of cases, Google is handing over information about where people have traveled and what they've searched for. CAHN: It is so chilling. It is so broad. It is so contrary to our civil rights. And yet because Google has so much of our data is just a ticking time bomb for pregnant people. ALLYN: Cahn says these keyword searches are so broad, they violate the Fourth Amendment's ban on unreasonable searches. But courts are still catching up to the technology. In Denver, police used the controversial tactic to find a suspect in an arson case that left five dead. Authorities obtained from Google who had searched for the address of a home that was set ablaze and made an arrest. Jennifer Lynch with the Electronic Frontier Foundation says such searches are fishing expeditions that can implicate innocent people. JENNIFER LYNCH: They haven't really been tested. It's still a relatively new search technique. And we're just now seeing judges deal with them. ALLYN: In a statement, Google says if a data request from authorities is overly broad, it challenges it. But Lynch points out that at least when it comes to broad searches of Google histories, the company is largely giving authorities what they want. LYNCH: This is especially concerning because Google doesn't appear to be pushing back on these kinds of searches. ALLYN: Google has in recent days committed to deleting location data showing when people visit an abortion provider. Inside Google, some workers are concerned that isn't enough. Ashok Chandwaney is a Google engineer and a member of the Alphabet Workers Union. ASHOK CHANDWANEY: They're really looking for these short, punchy press releases that get this, like, breathless, wow, Google is doing such good things. Or Alphabet is doing such good things - coverage in the tech media but then, like, really aren't actually substantial. ALLYN: Chandwaney says what would be substantial is if Google committed to figuring out all the ways law enforcement can get information on people seeking abortions. CHANDWANEY: And then make it so that the data that could get people charged or fined or thrown in jail or whatever for seeking out health care is not a thing that the company has to give to law enforcement. ALLYN: Google's own statistics show that it produces data for authorities about 80% of the time it receives requests. Bobby Allyn, NPR News.

The documents are dubbed the Uber Files. The files show the company, which many people use to get a ride, dodged local tax laws and worked to slow down investigations of its practices, even took advantage of its drivers. Someone gave these documents to The Guardian, which shared them with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, where Sydney Freedberg is the chief reporter. Good morning. SYDNEY FREEDBERG: Good morning. How are you, Steve? INSKEEP: I'm doing OK. I mean, some people are very familiar with Uber because they use it every day. They connect people who need a ride with drivers who want to give one. They, of course, are designed to evade taxi and transit rules. They operate a little bit outside the law, by definition. But are you saying it's worse than we thought? FREEDBERG: I think what we're saying is that a lot was known, Steve, about their practices in the United States, but very little was known about their aggressive, audacious and chaotic overseas expansion. So these documents essentially shed light on what happened when - in the years 2014 to 2017 when Uber is in the posture of expanding rapidly in Europe and elsewhere. INSKEEP: How did they get the cooperation of top officials in places like France, for example? FREEDBERG: Well, that - OK, so what these documents show is that the company kind of knowingly broke laws and thwarted law enforcement. And they secretly lobbied governments, and one of the top examples of that, I think, is Emmanuel Macron, who at the time was a young minister, very ambitious, and he held a lot of confidential talks, it turns out, with Uber at the time of their advance. There was all sorts of problems in Paris and elsewhere, Marseilles, because the taxi industry was totally opposed to Uber coming in and basically in defiance of local rules. So they needed a friend - Uber needed a friend and got in and sort of turned Macron into a top ally. INSKEEP: Did Uber manage to make a friend of another future president, Joe Biden, who was then vice president of the United States? FREEDBERG: Yeah, that's kind of an interesting, lovely little anecdote in our story. So President Biden, when he was vice president, is in Davos in 2016, and he asks for a meeting with the then CEO. And it's arranged by a bunch of former Obama aides, including David Plouffe, best known for being the architect of President Obama's 2008 campaign. They go into - they have a secret meeting. Uber wants it secret; Biden doesn't say anything about the secrecy. They go into a meeting in Davos right before Vice President Biden is to give a keynote address about the future - the digital economy and the future of work in the world. So they go into the meeting, and the CEO pitches Biden on what a great company Uber is. And then Uber goes on stage in the InterContinental in Davos, and he sticks a line in the speech about alluding to the company and what a kind of great deal it is for workers. INSKEEP: Which is not a suggestion of something improper. But they got in there and they were persuasive, and they persuaded Biden to promote their cause. Now, this thing about taking advantage of drivers and violence against drivers, very briefly, what did they do? FREEDBERG: Well, essentially - so there were these anti-Uber protests led by taxi drivers, and they've broken out in Europe. And the leaked correspondence shows that the CEO - the then-CEO and various executives in the company - not all but some - they basically encourage - at that point, they encourage employees to have Uber drivers stage a counterprotest. There was one in France that they were suggesting. So despite the warnings, they kind of put their - put the drivers at risk of attack, saying it would be worth it because in the words of the former CEO, violence guarantees success. So they're - it's a way for them to sort of curry favor with political types who might see the violence as distasteful. INSKEEP: OK.

CHANG: OK, so what exactly does Twitter allege in this lawsuit? BOND: Well, it accuses Musk of hypocrisy and acting in bad faith. I think it's worth reading from the lawsuit. It says he thinks he can, quote, \"change his mind, trash the company, disrupt its operations, destroy stockholder value and walk away. \"CHANG: OK, that's pretty strong language. What are their legal grounds for suing at this point? BOND: Well, Twitter says Musk has broken this agreement that he signed in several ways. It accuses him of secretly stopping taking the steps necessary to secure the financing he needs to complete this purchase. It also says he's disparaged the company and its executives. The agreement says he's not supposed to do that. And generally, it just says he has not cooperated to get this deal done the way he's supposed to. Now, remember, Ailsa, Musk is the one who initiated this whole thing. CHANG: Right. BOND: He started quietly buying up Twitter shares earlier this year, then surprised everyone by announcing he'd become Twitter's biggest investor. He accepted an invitation to join the board. Then he changed his mind. Then he surprised everyone again with this pitch to buy the whole company. CHANG: Exactly. BOND: And so now you have Twitter, which was not looking for a buyer, you know, suing to make him buy it. And it's saying that Musk has treated this whole process as, quote, \"an elaborate joke. \"CHANG: Wow. OK, so just remind us why Musk changed his mind in the first place here. BOND: Well, he said last week when he called off the deal that Twitter had misrepresented how many accounts on the platform are fake or spam, and that it hadn't turned over information he needed. But Twitter said that is all a pretext. It claims the real reason Musk wants to back out is that the deal no longer serves his personal interests. It says since he signed, the stock market has fallen, and that's made the price he agreed to pay for Twitter look expensive. And it's hurt the value of, you know, how he's going to pay - his Tesla shares, which are Musk's main source of wealth. CHANG: Exactly. OK, so what have we heard from Musk since this whole lawsuit got filed? BOND: Well, there's been no official response yet from Musk or his lawyers. He did just tweet, oh, the irony, lol. And over the weekend, he tweeted memes mocking Twitter's threats to sue him. You know, he'll get a chance to respond to this filing, and Twitter is asking for a quick four-day trial in September. This deal was supposed to close in October and they want to get this whole thing over with. CHANG: OK, well, about that potential trial, you have reported that Twitter has a strong legal case against Musk. So what's your sense of how this might all play out? BOND: I mean, look, if the court does agree with Musk, you know, he could just walk away. But you're right. The legal experts I've spoken with say that's unlikely. If the court sides with Twitter, it could compel Musk to go ahead and buy the whole company. But that would be a pretty drastic step - right? - to force an unwilling buyer to complete a deal this big. It could be something in between those two extremes. You know, Musk and Twitter could reach a settlement. They could agree on a lower price for the deal. Musk could agree to pay Twitter something - you know, less than $44 billion, but not nothing - to walk away.

Some innovators in the gun industry believe that one part of the solution is to make guns safer from accidental use. These so-called smart guns that are now under development use technology that's similar to what's in your smartphone. They have features that prevent anyone but the registered owner from unlocking the weapon. GINGER CHANDLER: One of them is just your fingerprint. MARTIN: That's Ginger Chandler. She's co-founder and CTO of LodeStar Works, a startup that's developing a smart gun it hopes to bring to market next year. CHANDLER: There's a pin pad on the side of the firearm. It's just like an old-fashioned lock where you just put a code in. And then the third way is via a connection with your phone via Bluetooth, where you just press lock and unlock. It's an app like any app we use today. MARTIN: Chandler previously worked on product development for major gun manufacturers Smith & Wesson and Remington. So she was shocked when she found out that her own gun-savvy mom didn't store a gun properly in her own home, which is a common and sometimes deadly mistake. CHANDLER: In the United States, there are a lot of firearms out there, and people are just unaware that their own firearms aren't safe. Everybody's kind of going, oh, that guy's stuff is not safe, but mine's good. My mother said that, and I said - and her husband had recently passed away. And we go into her office, and there is my stepfather's revolver sitting there with the ammo sitting next to it in an unlocked drawer. And she didn't even know. And I said, Mom, and you - we talk about this all the time. If you didn't know, there's so many people who don't know. We can cause them to be more aware just by bringing this firearm out. MARTIN: And she's convinced there's a real market for her gun. The profile of the typical buyer has shifted. Last year, in the midst of the pandemic, about half of all new gun owners were women. CHANDLER: They want to own their own destiny, but they also have small children at home. Maybe they're working remotely with their older children. And they don't want to just have firearms out, but they also want to be in control. MARGOT HIRSCH: Breaking ground in a very traditional industry is hard. MARTIN: This is Margot Hirsch. She supports gun safety innovators through her Smart Tech Challenges Foundation. HIRSCH: The firearm industry is not one to innovate. My sense is they'll only do it when they're forced to do it, and so it takes really brave innovators to forge a path in this area because. . . MARTIN: It's been a rough ride, though. The gun lobby worries that if these products get sold, the identifier technology will become mandatory. At the same time, a recent NPR/Ipsos survey found that most American gun owners support moderate gun control measures like background checks or increased age requirements. I started our conversation by asking Hirsch whether there is such a thing as a safe gun. HIRSCH: If there are going to be guns in the world, there are ways to make them safer. And developing a firearm that only can be used by an authorized user will dramatically help to prevent unnecessary deaths, especially youth suicides and unintentional deaths by firearms. So, yes, I strongly believe there is such thing as a safe gun. MARTIN: But people who want to carry out mass shootings can still use a smart gun to do it, right? HIRSCH: Yes, they could. However, mass shootings, as horrific as they are - and they obviously dominate the news - they account for less than 2% of the injuries and deaths due to guns. You know, the facts are that each year more than 100,000 Americans, which is a huge number, are injured due to gun violence with, approximately, I think, in 2021, of almost 45,000 deaths, 60% which are suicides. So although a smart gun might not prevent a mass shooting, they could definitely be used to address youth suicides. And that number is about 3,100 young people die every year with a firearm. MARTIN: Do you think there's an incentive to buy them? Because on the one hand, it would seem obvious that some people would want safer guns. But, I mean, there are more guns in America than anywhere else in the world. So these folks aren't necessarily going to trade their regular weapons in for safe guns. HIRSCH: Well, I don't think we're necessarily asking them to trade them in. It's like any new technology. I mean, let's remember - these guns haven't even made it onto the market yet. So we don't think they are going to replace the existing guns that are out there. However, we do believe that gun owners, when they go to buy new guns, will consider these guns for multiple reasons. And one is for personal protection. This could be the gun that is readily available, let's say, on the bedside table, in the kitchen, wherever, where it's secured and locked, and their children can't access it, but they know that if someone broke in their house or tried to take their weapon from them, it could not be used in that type of scenario. So we don't necessarily believe people are going to give up their existing guns, but we do believe there is a section of consumers and gun owners who will be very interested in purchasing these firearms once they are available on the market. MARTIN: What do you say to anti-gun violence activists who argue that you are just putting more guns on the market and that's not the way to solve America's gun violence epidemic? HIRSCH: I would say we all need to be realistic that, for the foreseeable future, guns are here. Guns are going to continue to be sold. So if people are going to continue to buy guns, we believe it is imperative that there is a smart gun option on the market. And I do think you will see a smart gun, if not multiple smart guns, on the market hopefully in the next two to three years. That's what we're hoping for, and we really think it will happen. MARTIN: Margot Hirsch, president of the Smart Tech Challenges Foundation. Thank you so much for your time. HIRSCH: Thank you, Rachel. MARTIN: We also heard from Ginger Chandler, co-founder and CTO of LodeStar Works, a startup developing a smart gun. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:   About 100 people are shot to death every day in this country. Some innovators in the gun industry believe that one part of the solution is to make guns safer from accidental use. These so-called smart guns that are now under development use technology that's similar to what's in your smartphone. They have features that prevent anyone but the registered owner from unlocking the weapon. GINGER CHANDLER: One of them is just your fingerprint. MARTIN: That's Ginger Chandler. She's co-founder and CTO of LodeStar Works, a startup that's developing a smart gun it hopes to bring to market next year. CHANDLER: There's a pin pad on the side of the firearm. It's just like an old-fashioned lock where you just put a code in. And then the third way is via a connection with your phone via Bluetooth, where you just press lock and unlock. It's an app like any app we use today. MARTIN: Chandler previously worked on product development for major gun manufacturers Smith & Wesson and Remington. So she was shocked when she found out that her own gun-savvy mom didn't store a gun properly in her own home, which is a common and sometimes deadly mistake. CHANDLER: In the United States, there are a lot of firearms out there, and people are just unaware that their own firearms aren't safe. Everybody's kind of going, oh, that guy's stuff is not safe, but mine's good. My mother said that, and I said - and her husband had recently passed away. And we go into her office, and there is my stepfather's revolver sitting there with the ammo sitting next to it in an unlocked drawer. And she didn't even know. And I said, Mom, and you - we talk about this all the time. If you didn't know, there's so many people who don't know. We can cause them to be more aware just by bringing this firearm out. MARTIN: And she's convinced there's a real market for her gun. The profile of the typical buyer has shifted. Last year, in the midst of the pandemic, about half of all new gun owners were women. CHANDLER: They want to own their own destiny, but they also have small children at home. Maybe they're working remotely with their older children. And they don't want to just have firearms out, but they also want to be in control. MARGOT HIRSCH: Breaking ground in a very traditional industry is hard. MARTIN: This is Margot Hirsch. She supports gun safety innovators through her Smart Tech Challenges Foundation. HIRSCH: The firearm industry is not one to innovate. My sense is they'll only do it when they're forced to do it, and so it takes really brave innovators to forge a path in this area because. . . MARTIN: It's been a rough ride, though. The gun lobby worries that if these products get sold, the identifier technology will become mandatory. At the same time, a recent NPR/Ipsos survey found that most American gun owners support moderate gun control measures like background checks or increased age requirements. I started our conversation by asking Hirsch whether there is such a thing as a safe gun. HIRSCH: If there are going to be guns in the world, there are ways to make them safer.

RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:  The second quarter loss came after a first quarter loss. So why is Netflix co-founder Reed Hastings telling investors that it's a big win? (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)REED HASTINGS: Tough in some ways losing a million and calling it success, but, you know, really, we're set up very well for the next year. INSKEEP: OK. Netflix is closely watched, both because so many people watch it and because it's been a leader in video streaming, so we've called NPR TV critic Eric Deggans. Eric, good morning. ERIC DEGGANS, BYLINE: Hi. INSKEEP: What is the case that a loss for Netflix is a gain for Netflix? DEGGANS: Yeah, I guess it's about managing expectations, right? You know, the answer to your question actually stretches back to April, when the company revealed that it lost 200,000 subscribers in the first quarter. And that was their largest subscriber loss in a decade. And back then, Netflix predicted they would probably lose 2 million subscribers in the second quarter. But thanks to the success this year of shows like \"Stranger Things,\" they managed to cut that loss in half. Now, it still means they lost more than a million subscribers so far this year. And this is important because Netflix is seen as a bellwether for the entire streaming industry. And their initial stumble in April made a lot of investors kind of question, you know, whether Wall Street had overvalued the streaming industry in general. I'd say yes. And now it feels like people may have a slightly more realistic idea of how the business is actually working. INSKEEP: Well, let's talk about what that realistic idea is. I suppose if you're in the position of Netflix, you can say we still have a big business and retrench, and it just won't be quite as big a business. Or you can say that there are still ways to grow after these losses. Do they have plans to grow? DEGGANS: Well, Netflix talked about a few ways of boosting subscribers and revenue, including placing ads in some shows. Now, after years of resisting people like me asking why they didn't have a cheaper subscription tier where people could watch Netflix shows with some ads in them, the company has agreed to develop such an option. Now, they're working with Microsoft, and they expect to roll out this option in early 2023 to subscribers in a handful of areas with big advertising markets - I don't know, maybe New York or Los Angeles or something like that. And I think they realize they've saturated the American TV market, and with so much competition from rivals like Disney+ and Hulu, they really need to offer less expensive options. They're also testing in Latin America a couple of different ways to charge subscribers more for sharing passwords. I think that's going to be a little tougher to pull off, even though Netflix says 100 million households might be accessing Netflix shows for free through password sharing. INSKEEP: Well, this is really interesting to hear you talk about this, Eric, because they're not necessarily just talking about trying to increase subscribers again. They're trying to figure out how to monetize the subscribers they have or the people who are interested, although I guess these other formats could lead to different audiences of subscribers. What else does the company need to work on? DEGGANS: Well, you know, they're basically an innovative disruptor that's become an institution. So some of the things that are at the heart of their business, which have distinguished them in the streaming world - they now need to reconsider that. For example, I think they should rethink the binge-watching model of releasing all episodes of so many series at once. The report touts the success, for example, of \"Stranger Things. \" They said that they drew 1. 3 billion hours of viewing in its fourth season this year. But it doesn't mention that that season was released in two chunks, and that allowed discussion to build among fans about the season over several weeks, and it encouraged some potential fans to check out the last two blockbuster episodes. I think that shows that more series would benefit from seeing their episodes released over a wider space of time, giving Netflix the chance to build the new franchises that it so desperately needs.

It's called DALL-E after Salvador Dali and the Pixar movie \"Wall-E. \" Until now, only a relatively few researchers, artists and others have been able to try it, but the company behind DALL-E says it's going to give access to a million more people starting today. NPR's Bobby Allyn joins us to discuss the art DALL-E can make and why some people are really worried about its possible uses. Hey there, Bobby. BOBBY ALLYN, BYLINE: Hey, Juana. SUMMERS: OK, so first, this is all incredibly visual - and we are on the radio. Can you describe how DALL-E works? ALLYN: (Laughter) Yeah. So I think the best way to understand it is just to use it. And, Juana, you and I were talking yesterday, and I said, OK, what better way to get how this thing works but to try it, right? So I asked you to give me a few prompts of images you'd like to see. And what did you tell me again? SUMMERS: Yeah. So the first one that I gave you was a taco playing pinball in the middle of the road. I guess I must have been hungry. And then another one was Satan wearing sunglasses, parachuting into Mount Vesuvius. ALLYN: I love it. OK, so I took those descriptions, and I entered them into the DALL-E system. Now, the system is built on this enormous database of images - right? - and then this really fancy computer code makes connections almost like the human brain and spits out images in seconds. So those prompts you just gave me - I put them into the system. I hit enter. And the results were pretty whimsical. Why don't you take a look and tell me what you think? SUMMERS: OK, so I'm looking at the first one now, and it does not look like DALL-E understands pinball as well as I do, but there's a couple of animated tacos. They are indeed in the middle of the road. One of them is skateboarding down a street. They're all really cute. And then this other one I might actually have nightmares about. ALLYN: Yeah, it's ghoulish. SUMMERS: It is very ghoulish. There are some sunglasses on a parachute going into Mount Vesuvius. Quite literal. ALLYN: (Laughter) Yeah, so most people using DALL-E right now are doing just this - are having fun. But, you know, if you take a look at them, it doesn't, at least to me, look like a computer generated them. I mean, they're quite impressive. So people now who are testing it out are doing things like this. They're doing realistic photos of silly situations. So it's all fun and games, right? But I spoke to Joanne Jang. She's the product manager of DALL-E, and she said, you know, Juana, some people have some pretty interesting ways that they're using it now. JOANNE JANG: A surgeon told us that they've been using it, actually, to help their patients visualize post jaw alignment surgery results. Filmmakers have told us that it has cut the time that it takes to storyboard from weeks to days. Restaurants run their menu items by DALL-E and got whole new plating ideas and menu inspirations that they've incorporated. SUMMERS: OK. But, Bobby, as I understand it, there are also some concerns about how DALL-E might be used. How are they accounting for those? And what are those concerns? ALLYN: So DALL-E will not let you generate images if you're using the name of a real person, like President Biden. But if you type in, say, a 79-year-old white American president, you do get some photos that vaguely resemble him. So, you know, there's no way to get an exact photo of, say, our president, but there is a way to get sort of some kind of photo that kind of looks like him. Right? It will not let you make pornographic images, violent images, images that are hateful or any photos showing things like ballot boxes and protests. You can't do that. They're really afraid that people would try to generate them and launch disinformation campaigns. SUMMERS: So, Bobby, you have told us about DALL-E, how it works. You have shown me how it works. But who is behind it? ALLYN: Yeah, it's a company called OpenAI. It was founded by Elon Musk - although he's no longer involved - and tech entrepreneur Sam Altman. It's financially backed by Microsoft. And DALL-E is ahead of the game when it comes to AI image generation. But tech giants - Google, Facebook, Amazon - they're all trying to develop similar AI tools right now. And after this trial period, you know, we'll see what happens. Maybe more will join, or maybe OpenAI will just stop inviting people. SUMMERS: All right. That is NPR Tech reporter Bobby Allyn. Thank you so much. ALLYN: Thanks, Juana.

But who is behind it? ALLYN: Yeah, it's a company called OpenAI. It was founded by Elon Musk - although he's no longer involved - and tech entrepreneur Sam Altman. It's financially backed by Microsoft. And DALL-E is ahead of the game when it comes to AI image generation. But tech giants - Google, Facebook, Amazon - they're all trying to develop similar AI tools right now. And after this trial period, you know, we'll see what happens. Maybe more will join, or maybe OpenAI will just stop inviting people. SUMMERS: All right. That is NPR Tech reporter Bobby Allyn. Thank you so much.

And maybe you're deciding whether you really want it or you just want to shop around a bit more. But sometimes when you get back to your shopping cart, the price is suddenly higher. The reason could be the pricing algorithms many online retailers are using to adjust their prices without another human entering a single keystroke. Our co-host Steve Inskeep asked Harvard economics professor Alexander MacKay what's going on and what it all means for consumers. ALEXANDER MACKAY: A pricing algorithm is simply a step-by-step set of instructions. And these instructions can be very simple, or they can be very complicated depending on the algorithm that a company chooses to do. But a key thing about the algorithm is that given different inputs - like, say, time of day or weather or how many customers - it might decide on a different price. And one of the things that's particularly interesting and a focus of our research is that a lot of companies use algorithms that depend on the price of their competitors. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  I guess some people are very familiar with this if they travel very often because they know that airline seat prices change constantly. They can change in the space of five minutes. Is this the kind of thing we're talking about? MACKAY: Yeah, that's exactly right. So airlines have been using pricing systems that allow for time-varying pricing for a long time. One thing that's sort of changed in recent years is that a lot more retailers have been adopting high-frequency pricing algorithms, you know, in particular in online markets. So one thing that I think a lot of people expected with the rise of online markets was that there'd be very intense price competition, and you'd sort of see the same prices on every different website, in part because it's pretty easy to shop across online retailers - right? - just a few clicks to go from one website to another. But in fact, that hasn't actually happened. There are big price differences across websites, which is sort of surprising. In fact, I just checked this morning. You know, I'm looking at a 15-pack of Allegra tablets, which is a common allergy drug. And on Amazon, it's showing me a price of 12. 99; at Target, it's showing me a price of 15. 69; and at Walgreens, it's showing me a price of 17. 99. We're looking at a $5 price difference for the exact same product. INSKEEP: What's going on there? Are they all running their own algorithm? MACKAY: Yeah. Some retailers have much more high-frequency pricing algorithms that allow them to update their prices, you know, say, every 15 minutes. The other thing we noticed was that the firms with the faster pricing algorithms consistently priced lower than their rivals. The question is, is this a good thing? When you actually get into the economics of it, what it can do is actually discourage price competition among retailers. But if you have sort of a slower technology and you know that one of these faster firms is always going to undercut whatever price change you make, it sort of takes price competition off the table. So why try to start a price war against a firm whose algorithm will see my price change and immediately undercut it within the span of 15 minutes potentially? I don't really have much of an opportunity to gain market share. INSKEEP: Although I guess that points to another reality about these algorithms. They are not necessarily set up for the benefit of customers. They are set up for the best interest of the person who's paying for the algorithm. MACKAY: Absolutely. Absolutely. So firms are trying to maximize profits, and they're trying to do it in a way that's, you know, legal and competitive. If you're a company and you're trying to decide, should I adopt this algorithm or not? - it's sort of in your best interest to adopt an algorithm to be able to consistently undercut your rivals, to maintain a market share advantage, but also to have this secondary effect of discouraging them from competing with you on price. INSKEEP: Wait a minute. So I'm going to offer the lowest price, but I'm not going to have a race to the bottom because nobody else is going to try to get below me. MACKAY: That's exactly right. So even though, relatively, it looks like the faster firm has the best price and is being competitive, because I've taken price competition off the table, my price can even be higher than it would have been otherwise. INSKEEP: This sounds like yet another way that the internet feels free, but it's not free at all to the consumer. MACKAY: I think it's certainly counterintuitive, and it has some features that look a lot like intense competition. But absolutely, when you get into it a little bit, seems to have these effects that are a little bit surprising. INSKEEP: What would you do about this as a government matter, a policy matter or as an ordinary consumer? MACKAY: So one feature that these algorithms have is that they respond to the price changes of rivals. So if regulators are somehow able to limit or prevent companies from directly incorporating rivals' prices into the algorithms, that might be one way to sort of take away the threat of undercutting their price and actually drive prices down across the board. So, again, a big reason why firms might be disincentivized from lowering their price is that your rival company's going to quickly respond with another price cut. But if we, say, regulated companies to change prices only once a week or once per day, you know, in certain markets, that would prevent a company from threatening to quickly undercut their rivals' price changes. INSKEEP: I'm wondering if these algorithms have been significant enough in their effects to be a factor in inflation. You're in this marketplace that ought to drive prices down, but instead they sort of drift upward or stay in place. MACKAY: Algorithms could absolutely have an effect on inflation. They are able to more quickly respond to changes in various factors in the market, both in terms of demand - what consumers are wanting - and also in terms of supply, in terms of input cost. Some traditional pricing practices consist of manufacturers sort of deciding once per year what their prices are going to be. And in those settings, you sort of have to anticipate what's going to happen over the course of the year. And you may not be able to respond quickly to supply chains disruptions that we've seen. And so I think under traditional pricing, certainly, we might have seen slower price increases than what we see today with pricing technology that can really take into account changes in the market in much more timely basis. INSKEEP: Alexander MacKay is a Harvard economics professor. Thanks so much. MACKAY: Thank you so much.

And a quick note - Facebook's parent, Meta, pays NPR to license NPR content. SHANNON BOND, BYLINE: Software engineer Michael Sayman has been making apps since he was 13. At just 25, he's already worked at Facebook, Google and Twitter on efforts to win over teenagers. And he says these days, one company is setting the curve. MICHAEL SAYMAN: Everyone's eyes are glued to TikTok and the way it works right now. BOND: The Chinese-owned short video app has surged to 1 billion users in just a few short years, minting dance trends, absurd challenges and mega viral music hits, like Lil Nas X's \"Old Town Road. \"(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"OLD TOWN ROAD\")LIL NAS X: (Singing) I'm going to take my horse to the old town road. I'm going to ride. . . BOND: Now, Facebook is still by far the world's biggest social network, with almost 3 billion people logging on every month and even more when you add in Instagram, also owned by Facebook parent Meta. But under pressure from TikTok's success, the company is remaking itself, no longer the network defined primarily by the friends and family you choose to connect with. SAYMAN: Social media is taking a shift away from sharing what you're up to with your friends to, like, you know, posting to everyone in the world. BOND: It's a radical rethinking. But Facebook lost users for the first time late last year. Its audience is aging. Younger people who used to flock to Instagram are now on TikTok. The company plans to give its latest financial report on Wednesday, showing just how much competition is squeezing its ad business. CEO Mark Zuckerberg acknowledged the threat on a call with investors in February. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MARK ZUCKERBERG: People have a lot of choices for how they want to spend their time. And apps like TikTok are growing very quickly. BOND: So Facebook introduced TikTok-like short videos called Reels. Open up Instagram or Facebook these days, and it's hard to miss. Feeds are full of Reels, many of which are actually videos reposted from TikTok. Now the company is going even further, overhauling the Facebook app to look and work more like TikTok. Matt Navarra is a social media consultant and analyst. MATT NAVARRA: Facebook is really - was always centered around being your close friends, your close family and what they're doing and all of their updates. BOND: Over time, that expanded to joining groups and following pages for brands and celebrities. But the common factor was always posts from people you chose to follow. Then came TikTok. NAVARRA: With TikTok, it's kind of turned on its head. It's not really important about who that person is, where they are and your connection to them. BOND: Its main For You page shows whatever TikTok's algorithm thinks you might like, no matter who made it. Facebook is starting to do the same thing, mixing in more recommended videos from strangers. Software engineer Sayman says the company has little choice. SAYMAN: The moment that TikTok comes along and it's like, oh, who cares who you follow? Like, let's just make a For You feed of just stuff you might be interested in - just one massive talent show. Facebook's like, well, we need to get in that space, too, right? We can't - you know, we've got to get in there. BOND: Similar changes to Instagram are already sparking backlash. This week, Kim Kardashian and Kylie Jenner both reposted a meme demanding, make Instagram Instagram again, stop trying to be TikTok. Facebook says posts from friends and family are still going to be prominently featured in its apps. Instagram head Adam Mosseri says the company isn't getting rid of what people love. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)ADAM MOSSERI: But we're also going to need to evolve because the world is changing quickly, and we're going to have to change along with it. BOND: CEO Zuckerberg has been clear about his goal - squeezing as much money as he can from his company's existing apps so it can build what he sees as the next big platform, the metaverse, where he hopes people will interact in virtual reality. And making money means getting more people to spend more time on Facebook and Instagram so they can sell more ads. But will it work? Navarra is skeptical. NAVARRA: TikTok's got one fundamental thing that Facebook doesn't have, and that is that TikTok's cool. BOND: And he says it's hard to copy cool. Shannon Bond, NPR News.

And so a chess-playing robot breaks the finger of a little boy who was trying to outflank him at a chess match. Onlookers intervened to extricate the boy's hand from what's called the actuator, which a lot of us might call a claw. The boy's finger was placed in a plaster cast, and he returned to the tournament the next day. Sergey Smagin, vice president of the Moscow Chess Federation, told the Baza Telegram Channel that the robot had lunged after the little boy tried to make his move too quickly.

But as NPR's Matthew Schuerman reports, landscaping companies have been slow to join the trend. MATTHEW SCHUERMAN, BYLINE: For homeowners, electric lawnmowers are about as effective and inexpensive as gas-fueled versions. But if you're a professional using your equipment all day, day after day, you'll need something like this. (SOUNDBITE OF LAWN MOWER)JEN STROKER: So this is our Rival model. This is our most popular model. SCHUERMAN: That's Jen Stroker, a sales rep for Mean Green Mowers, a 10-year-old electric lawnmower company. She's demonstrating one of the company's machines in a park in Westchester County, New York. STROKER: This is a 7 1/2-hour-run-time mower, and this is a 52-inch deck. SCHUERMAN: Electric lawnmowers won't help much in terms of climate change and emissions. People just don't mow their lawns nearly as much as they drive. But they don't emit noxious pollutants, and they are quieter. STROKER: Our main customers are primarily municipalities, colleges, schools, hospitals - anywhere you need quiet. SCHUERMAN: With its huge battery, the Rival starts at nearly $30,000, several times as much as a comparable gas-powered mower. But given the lower maintenance and operating costs, Mean Green says you can break even in a matter of months to years. Still, that's a huge upfront investment for someone like Austin Acocella, a landscaper in Westchester. AUSTIN ACOCELLA: In the future, I would love to buy them. But right at this second, I just can't because of inflation and just everything that's going on. I just can't swing it yet.

SCHUERMAN: But for the most part, he says these tools just don't measure up to their gas versions. ACOCELLA: I need something that's going to last long or that's - something that's easy. Like, I have a gas can on a truck that I just fuel up, and I go. How many batteries do I have to have in order to get through the day? SCHUERMAN: Across the country, about 40% of new lawnmower sales are electric, according to Fact. MR, a market research company. But for professional-grade models, the number's much lower. So when California passed a bill last fall mandating that all new lawn equipment be zero emissions, the landscape industry objected. They said the technology wasn't there yet. The law's author, assembly member Marc Berman, disagrees. MARC BERMAN: This equipment is ready today. There are at least eight brands that produce zero-emission equipment in each major equipment category. SCHUERMAN: The law kicks in in 2024, but it doesn't forbid the use of existing gas-powered gear, so landscapers won't have to switch over all at once. BERMAN: We imagine that people will transition to fully electric fleets over the course of five, six, 10 years. SCHUERMAN: California is the first state to enact such a ban. Now New York's considering one. Nonprofit groups have also supported about 20 localities around the country to make this switch but to do so voluntarily. California lawmakers allocated $30 million to offset the extra costs for landscapers. But the landscapers say that's just a small percentage of what they'll really need. Matthew Schuerman, NPR News.

It was a lot of blood, sweat and tears into developing a product that we were really excited about and really proud of. SULLIVAN: Unlike batteries in cellphones or even cars, these batteries could charge and discharge energy for as long as 30 years. And this particular design seemed to hold enough energy to power a house. Researchers pictured people plunking them down next to their air conditioners, attaching solar panels to them and everyone living happily ever after off the grid. HOWARD: It was beyond promise. We were seeing it functioning as designed, as expected. SULLIVAN: They thought the batteries would be the next great American success story. But that's not what happened. Today, this warehouse is shuttered and empty. All the employees who worked here were laid off. And across the world, a Chinese company is making the batteries in Dalian, China. The Chinese company didn't steal this technology. It was given to them by the U. S. Department of Energy. An NPR investigation found the department allowed the technology and jobs to move overseas, violating its own licensing rules while failing to intervene on behalf of U. S. workers in multiple instances, according to internal department emails. Now China is forging ahead, investing millions into this cutting-edge green technology that was supposed to help keep the U. S. and its economy out front. JOANNE SKIEVASKI: It just is mind-boggling. SULLIVAN: Joanne Skievaski is the vice president of finance for a U. S. company called Forever Energy that has been trying to get a license from the department to make the batteries here for more than a year. SKIEVASKI: This is technology made from taxpayer dollars. It was invented by a national lab, and it's deployed in China, and it's held in China. To say it's frustrating is an understatement. SULLIVAN: Department of Energy officials declined NPR's request for an interview and wouldn't explain how technology that costs U. S. taxpayers $15 million ended up in China. But after NPR sent department officials detailed questions laying out the timeline of events, officials terminated the license it gave to the Chinese company. In a statement, officials said the department, quote, \"takes American manufacturing obligations extremely seriously\" and is now, quote, \"undertaking an internal review of the licensing of vanadium battery technology. \" The story of how this happened begins where the battery was born, three hours southwest of Seattle, in the basement of a government lab called the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory where Courtney went to visit. COURTNEY FLATT, BYLINE: Safety goggles on. VINCE SPRENKLE: Yep. FLATT: Vince Sprenkle works with energy storage here at the lab. SPRENKLE: We're going to go down into the redox flow battery lab. FLATT: It was down here in 2006 that more than two dozen scientists began to suspect that a special mix of acid and electrolyte could hold unusual amounts of energy without degrading. It turned out to be right. Do you feel kind of, like, on the cutting edge of learning about these batteries? SPRENKLE: Yeah, we are. I mean, I think we've got one of the leading research groups in the country and probably the world in this technology. FLATT: It's because of this leading edge that when a success happens, the lab encourages scientists to go out and see if they can make and sell the inventions in the real world. The lab and the U. S. government still hold the patents because American taxpayers paid for the research, but the Department of Energy licenses the patents to scientists and companies willing to take a shot. In this case, it took six years and millions of taxpayer dollars to discover the perfect battery recipe. Gary Yang was the lead scientist, and he was excited to see if he could make them. In 2012, he left the lab with the license in hand and started UniEnergy Technologies at the warehouse in Mukilteo, Wash. GARY YANG: I left the lab, full legal process and start UniEnergy Technology in Washington state. FLATT: He hired engineers and researchers, but then he ran into trouble. He says he couldn't find any U. S. investors. YANG: I talked to almost all major investment bank. None of them invest in battery. FLATT: So he turned to a Chinese businessman and a company called Dalian Rongke Power and its parent company, which agreed to invest and even help manufacture the batteries. And so began a slow shift. First, Chris Howard said, it was just some parts; ultimately, it was the whole process. HOWARD: Manufacturing was subsequently shifted to our sister company in China, and they would take on that role. FLATT: In 2017, Yang and UniEnergy formalized the situation and gave Rongke Power an official sublicense, allowing the company to make the batteries. SULLIVAN: So here's the thing - companies can choose to manufacture in China, but in this case, Yang's original license clearly says on Page 6 he has to sell batteries in the United States, and those batteries have to be, quote, \"substantially manufactured\" here. Yang acknowledges he didn't do that. He was mostly selling batteries in China. And the batteries he did sell here were largely made in China. But he says in all those years, the department never raised any concerns or intervened. Then in 2019, Chris Howard said he and the other engineers were called to a conference room. Supervisors told them they, too, would have to go to China to work there for four months at a time at Rongke Power. HOWARD: And that was set to be increased on the premise that there were certain government programs, Chinese government programs, that would support funding efforts. So it was unclear, certainly to myself and some of the other engineers, what the plan was. SULLIVAN: In a statement, the department said that license monitoring is a priority and that a review of this case is underway. All of which brings us to Yang. Yang was born in China, but he is a U. S. citizen and got his Ph. D. at the University of Connecticut. He says he wanted to manufacture here, but at the time, China was doing more to encourage battery production. And he told us China could do it better. YANG: In this field - manufacturing, engineering - China ahead of U. S. SULLIVAN: China is ahead of the U. S. YANG: Ahead of U. S. Many wouldn't believe - engineering wise, aheadSULLIVAN: He says far from helping China, the Chinese engineers were helping his U. S. employees. But you can see in several news reports at the time, it was helping China. The Chinese government launched several large demonstration projects and announced millions in funding. FLATT: As things began to take off in China, here in the states, Yang was once again in financial trouble. So he made a decision that would again keep the technology from staying in the U. S. He transferred the license from UniEnergy to a company called Vanadis. ROELOF PLATENKAMP: Vanadis is based in the Netherlands, and we will set up a holding company in Switzerland. FLATT: Roelof Platenkamp is Vanadis' founding partner. Platenkamp told NPR the company's plan was to continue making the batteries in China and then set up a factory in Germany and eventually maybe the U. S. He says he has to manufacture in Europe because the European Union has strict rules about these things. PLATENKAMP: I have to be a European company, or certainly a non-Chinese company, in Europe. FLATT: But the United States has these rules, too. And any transfer of a U. S. government license needs U. S. government approval. SULLIVAN: Which Yang apparently had no trouble getting. We looked at department emails and found that last summer, on July 7, one of the top officials at UniEnergy wrote to a government manager at the Department of Energy Lab in Washington saying they were going to make a deal with Vanadis. We believe they have the right blend of technical expertise, the official wrote. The manager wrote back that he would need confirmation. A second employee sent confirmation an hour and a half later, and the license was transferred. Now, if anyone from the lab or the Department of Energy during that hour and a half thought to check whether Vanadis was an American company or whether it intended to manufacture in the United States is unclear. Even Vanadis' website says it plans to make the batteries in China. Department of Energy officials told us they take all license transfers seriously and have recently closed significant loopholes. But they acknowledge their efforts rely to some extent on, quote, \"good faith disclosures\" by the companies, which means if companies like UniEnergy don't say anything, the U. S. government may never know. It's a problem government investigators found has been going on for years. In 2018, the Government Accountability Office found the department lacked resources to properly monitor its licenses, was relying on antiquated computer systems and didn't have consistent policies across its labs. FLATT: It was an American company, Forever Energy, that actually read the vanadium battery license and raised a red flag more than a year ago. Joanne Skievaski and others there say they repeatedly warned department officials that the UniEnergy license was not in compliance. Officials repeatedly told them it was. SKIEVASKI: How is it that the national lab did not require U. S. manufacturing? Not only is it a violation of the license, it's a violation to our country. FLATT: Skievaski hopes that now that the department has revoked the license, Forever Energy will get a chance. They're hoping to open a factory in Louisiana. SKIEVASKI: We are ready to go with this technology. SULLIVAN: Skievaski told us it will be hard at this point for any American company to catch up. Industry trade reports lists Dalian Rongke Power as the No. 1 manufacturer of vanadium flow batteries worldwide. And the bigger question looming over all of this is whether China will stop making the batteries once an American company is granted the right to start making them. FLATT: That may be unlikely. Chinese news reports announced this summer that China is about to bring online one of the largest battery farms in the world, hoping to set new records for energy output. The reports say the entire battery farm is built out of vanadium redux flow batteries. I'm Courtney Flatt. SULLIVAN: And I'm Laura Sullivan, NPR News. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:   It's a favorite promise of politicians - keep manufacturing jobs and technology in America. And yet the U. S. keeps losing both to other countries. NPR's Laura Sullivan and Courtney Flatt from Public Radio's Northwest News Network investigate one story about a cutting-edge battery and how the U. S. may have lost the next big thing to China, again. LAURA SULLIVAN, BYLINE: Chris Howard is standing in the rain outside an empty warehouse in Mukilteo, Wash. CHRIS HOWARD: We used to have 10 shipping containers here; there were empty containers back here; customers and clients coming for visits. SULLIVAN: Howard used to work in this warehouse with more than a dozen other engineers and researchers for an American company called UniEnergy. Its name is still on the sign out front. What they were doing here was building a battery. Not just any battery - something called a vanadium redox flow battery. It was about the size of a refrigerator.

Is that just how technology works? Nope, that's how tech companies make more money from us. That's according to The Washington Post's tech columnist, Geoffrey Fowler. He's been researching the life spans of some of the most popular gadgets and asking, why do they seem to be designed to die? Geoffrey Fowler, welcome. GEOFFREY FOWLER: Hello, hello. ESTRIN: So give us an example of one of your favorite devices that you researched, and what did you learn about it? FOWLER: Well, let's talk about one of the most successful Apple products of the last couple of years - the AirPods. So these things are super convenient. You pop them in your ears. There's no wires. But something kind of happens to them after about two years - or at least happened to mine. I started hearing that (vocalizing) sound, which means that the battery is no longer good. And, you know, soon enough, it can only really keep going for maybe five, 10 minutes before you hear that sound. This happened to me. And so I went to the Apple store. And I said, hi, could you replace the batteries in these? And they said no. All they would do was sell me new AirPods and throw away the old ones. And the reason is the batteries inside those AirPods are glued inside. And it's like, why did they have to design these this way? But then I realized, aha, this is all part of the master plan - get us to buy a new pair. ESTRIN: So is this a master plan by the tech companies to get us to keep buying things, or is it just that batteries are not physically made to last? FOWLER: Lithium rechargeable batteries are going to die. The question is, what do you do about that fact upfront? When we buy products with rechargeable batteries sealed inside of them, it's like buying a car with tires that you can't change. Companies could design these products differently. They could - and used to, in many cases - design them to have a little hatch in the back that pops open. You take out the battery when it's dead, you put in a new one and you're good to go. ESTRIN: Let me ask you, what does this matter if - you know, if technology keeps updating, every few years we want to buy the next and latest, greatest update of some device. I mean, isn't that just what technology is about? FOWLER: Look, you're talking to the gadget guy for The Washington Post. Of course I love new gadgets. But the thing that we're not talking enough about is it's also an environmental disaster. So first of all, the materials that go into making these devices are rare. Some of them have to be mined in places like Africa - like cobalt - in ways that are really damaging to the people that have to do this mining. You know, gadgets like phones or even laptops don't use a lot of energy, you know, over their life. However, most of the energy that's consumed over their entire lifespan goes into simply making them - about 70%. So every time we buy a new thing, that means something new has to be made. And that's where the damage is being done. ESTRIN: So you have some ideas for compelling companies to, you know, tell consumers up front how long their devices are actually going to last and some ideas for how to change this. What are your ideas? FOWLER: You know, the FTC already is able to put regulations in place to require companies to do things like list where products are made - made in China, made in the U. S. Why not require them to say, what is the battery recharge count on this product? And also, what happens when the battery dies? Is there a service to get it replaced, and how much does that cost? That seems like information that should be known to every consumer upfront. ESTRIN: Geoffrey Fowler, tech columnist at The Washington Post, thank you so much for joining me. Hope you don't have a gadget funeral anytime soon. FOWLER: Thank you.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)OBAMA: The world wants American goods, and my administration is going to go to bat for America's businesses around the world. You should know that. (APPLAUSE)KELLY: After shouting out LCD screens and fiber optic cables, Obama turned to an up and coming technology that seemed to show promise. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)OBAMA: And I have no idea what this is - vanadium redox fuel cells. (LAUGHTER)OBAMA: That's one of the coolest things I've ever said out loud. (LAUGHTER)KELLY: Researchers at the federal government's Pacific Northwest National Lab surely would have agreed. For the past five years, they had been developing vanadium redox technology, getting it ready for commercial use. And this came at a time when the Obama administration was making a major push to reinvigorate American manufacturing. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)OBAMA: So we have a huge opportunity at this moment to bring manufacturing back, but we have to seize it. KELLY: That's Obama at his State of the Union address the following year, 2012. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)OBAMA: Tonight, my message to business leaders is simple. Ask yourselves what you can do to bring jobs back to your country, and your country will do everything we can to help you succeed. (APPLAUSE)KELLY: That same year, UniEnergy Technologies was founded with a license to make the vanadium redox flow batteries developed at the National Lab. And as the company grew, claims about supporting American technology and manufacturing kept coming from the White House, regardless of which president lived there. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)DONALD TRUMP: We're bringing manufacturing back to the United States big league. We're reducing taxes. KELLY: It was a particular fixation for Donald Trump during his time in office. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: I remember when I was growing up, I'd see made in America all over the place - a little bit made in the USA - but made in America. Everything had made in America. And we're starting that again. And it's happening again, as you know. We're here today. . . KELLY: And Trump's successor would pick up that baton, too. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: And if we think we're not in a race, well, guess what? Take a look at China. Take a look at China. KELLY: President Biden last summer at a Mack Trucks facility in Pennsylvania. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BIDEN: It's a straightforward solution - support and grow more American-based companies. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)KELLY: And yet, it was the federal government itself that let those cutting edge batteries slip away. NPR's Laura Sullivan and Courtney Flatt from Public Radio's Northwest News Network will pick up the story from here with their investigation into how vanadium redox flow batteries ended up being made in a factory in China. LAURA SULLIVAN, BYLINE: The Chinese company didn't steal this technology. It was given to them by the U. S. Department of Energy. An NPR investigation found the department allowed the technology and jobs to move overseas, violating its own licensing rules while failing to intervene on behalf of U. S. workers in multiple instances according to internal department emails. Now, China is forging ahead, investing millions into this cutting edge green technology that was supposed to help keep the U. S. and its economy out front. JOANNE SKIEVASKI: It just is mind-boggling. SULLIVAN: Joanne Skievaski is the vice president of finance for a U. S. company called Forever Energy that has been trying to get a license from the department to make the batteries here for more than a year. SKIEVASKI: This is technology made from taxpayer dollars. It was invented by a national lab. And it's deployed in China, and it's held in China. To say it's frustrating is an understatement. SULLIVAN: Department of Energy officials declined NPR's request for an interview and wouldn't explain how technology that cost U. S. taxpayers $15 million ended up in China. But after NPR sent department officials detailed questions laying out the timeline of events, officials terminated the license it gave to the Chinese company. In a statement, officials said the department, quote, \"takes American manufacturing obligations extremely seriously\" and is now, quote, \"undertaking an internal review of the licensing of vanadium battery technology. \" The story of how this happened begins where the battery was born, three hours southwest of Seattle, in the basement of a government lab called the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, where Courtney went to visit. COURTNEY FLATT, BYLINE: Safety goggles on. VINCE SPRENKLE: Yep. FLATT: Vince Sprenkle works with energy storage here at the lab. SPRENKLE: We're going to go down into the redox flow battery lab. FLATT: It was down here in 2006 that more than two dozen scientists began to suspect that a special mix of acid and electrolyte could hold unusual amounts of energy without degrading. They turned out to be right. Do you feel kind of, like, on the cutting edge of learning about these batteries? SPRENKLE: Yeah, we are. I mean, I think we've got one of the leading research groups in the country and probably the world in this technology. FLATT: It's because of this leading edge that when a success happens, the lab encourages scientists to go out and see if they can make and sell the inventions in the real world. The lab and the U. S. government still hold the patents because American taxpayers paid for the research. But the Department of Energy licenses the patents to scientists and companies willing to take a shot. In this case, it took six years and millions of taxpayer dollars to discover the perfect battery recipe. Gary Yang was the lead scientist, and he was excited to see if he could make them. In 2012, he left the lab with the license in hand and started UniEnergy Technologies at the warehouse in Mukilteo, Washington. GARY YANG: I left the lab - total legal process - and start UniEnergy Technology (ph) in Washington state. FLATT: He hired engineers and researchers, but then he ran into trouble. He says he couldn't find any U. S. investors. YANG: I talked to almost all major investment bank. None of them invest in battery. FLATT: So he turned to a Chinese businessman and a company called Dalian Rongke Power and its parent company, which agreed to invest and even help manufacture the batteries. And so began a slow shift. First, Chris Howard said, it was just some parts. Ultimately, it was the whole process. HOWARD: Manufacturing was subsequently shifted to our sister company in China, and they would take on that role. FLATT: In 2017, Yang and UniEnergy formalized the situation and gave Rongke Power an official sublicense, allowing the company to make the batteries. SULLIVAN: So here's the thing - companies can choose to manufacture in China, but in this case, Yang's original license clearly says on page six, he has to sell batteries in the United States, and those batteries have to be, quote, \"substantially manufactured\" here. Yang acknowledges he didn't do that. He was mostly selling batteries in China, and the batteries he did sell here were largely made in China. But he says in all those years, the department never raised any concerns or intervened. Then, in 2019, Chris Howard said he and the other engineers were called to a conference room. Supervisors told them they, too, would have to go to China to work there for four months at a time at Rongke Power. HOWARD: And that was set to be increased on the premise that there were certain government programs, Chinese government programs, that would support funding efforts. So it was unclear, certainly to myself and some of the other engineers, what the plan was. SULLIVAN: In a statement, the department said that license monitoring is a priority and that a review of this case is underway - all of which brings us to Yang. Yang was born in China, but he is a U. S. citizen and got his Ph. D. at the University of Connecticut. He says he wanted to manufacture here, but at the time, China was doing more to encourage battery production. And he told us China could do it better. YANG: In this field - manufacturing, engineering - China ahead of U. S. SULLIVAN: China is ahead of the U. S. YANG: They're ahead of U. S. - many wouldn't believe, engineering wise, ahead. SULLIVAN: He says, far from helping China, the Chinese engineers were helping his U. S. employees. But you can see in several news reports at the time, it was helping China. The Chinese government launched several large demonstration projects and announced millions in funding. FLATT: As things began to take off in China, here in the States, Yang was once again in financial trouble. So he made a decision that would again keep the technology from staying in the U. S. He transferred the license from UniEnergy to a company called Vanadis. ROELOF PLATENKAMP: Vanadis is based in the Netherlands, and we will set up the holding company in Switzerland. FLATT: Roelof Platenkamp is Vanadis's founding partner. Platenkamp told NPR the company's plan was to continue making the batteries in China and then set up a factory in Germany and eventually maybe the U. S. He says he has to manufacture in Europe because the European Union has strict rules about these things. PLATENKAMP: I have to be a European company - yeah - or certainly a non-Chinese company in Europe. FLATT: But the United States has these rules, too. And any transfer of a U. S. government license needs U. S. government approval. SULLIVAN: Which Yang apparently had no trouble getting. We looked at department emails and found that last summer, on July 7, one of the top officials at UniEnergy wrote to a government manager at the Department of Energy Lab in Washington, saying they were going to make a deal with Vanadis. We believe they have the right blend of technical expertise, the official wrote. The manager wrote back that he would need confirmation. A second employee sent confirmation an hour and a half later, and the license was transferred. Now, if anyone from the lab or the Department of Energy during that hour and a half thought to check whether Vanadis was an American company or whether it intended to manufacture in the United States is unclear. Even Vanadis's website says it plans to make the batteries in China. Department of Energy officials told us they take all license transfer seriously and have recently closed significant loopholes. But they acknowledge their efforts rely to some extent on, quote, \"good faith disclosures\" by the companies, which means if companies like UniEnergy don't say anything, the U. S. government may never know. It's a problem government investigators found has been going on for years. In 2018, the Government Accountability Office found the department lacked resources to properly monitor its licenses, was relying on antiquated computer systems and didn't have consistent policies across its labs. FLATT: It was an American company, Forever Energy, that actually read the vanadium battery license and raised a red flag more than a year ago. Joanne Skievaski and others there say they repeatedly warned department officials that the UniEnergy license was not in compliance. Officials repeatedly told them it was. SKIEVASKI: How is it that the national lab did not require U. S. manufacturing? Not only is it a violation of the license, it's a violation to our country. FLATT: Skievaski hopes that now that the department has revoked the license, Forever Energy will get a chance. They're hoping to open a factory in Louisiana. SKIEVASKI: We are ready to go with this technology. SULLIVAN: Skievaski told us it will be hard at this point for any American company to catch up. Industry trade reports list Dalian Rongke Power as the No. 1 manufacturer of vanadium flow batteries worldwide. And the bigger question looming over all of this is whether China will stop making the batteries once an American company is granted the right to start making them. FLATT: That may be unlikely. Chinese news reports announced this summer that China is about to bring online one of the largest battery farms in the world, hoping to set new records for energy output. The reports say the entire battery farm is built out of vanadium redux flow batteries. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)KELLY: That was Courtney Flatt from public radio's Northwest News Network along with NPR's Laura Sullivan. You can read their entire investigation at npr. org. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)KELLY: It's CONSIDER THIS from NPR. I'm Mary Louise Kelly. MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:   Just north of Seattle near the shores of Puget Sound sits an empty warehouse in Mukilteo, Wash. CHRIS HOWARD: We used to have 10 shipping containers here. There were empty containers back here, customers and clients coming for visits. KELLY: Chris Howard used to work in that warehouse with more than a dozen other engineers and researchers for an American company called UniEnergy. The name is still on the sign out front. They were building a battery - not just any battery, something called a vanadium redox flow battery. It was about the size of a refrigerator. And Howard and the rest of the employees thought it was going to change the world. HOWARD: It was more than a job. It was a lot of blood, sweat and tears into developing a product that we were really excited about and really proud of. KELLY: Unlike batteries in cell phones, even cars, these batteries could charge and discharge energy for as long as 30 years. And this particular design seemed to hold enough energy to power a house. Researchers pictured people plunking them down next to their air conditioners, attaching solar panels to them, and everyone living happily ever after off the grid. HOWARD: It was beyond promise. We were seeing it functioning as designed, as expected. KELLY: They thought the batteries would be the next great American success story. That is not what happened. Today, that warehouse sits, shuttered, empty. All the employees who worked there were laid off. And those batteries, they are now being made at a factory in northeastern China. CONSIDER THIS - cutting edge technology developed in an American national lab, paid for with American tax dollars, was given away to a Chinese company. Using internal government documents, an NPR investigation tells the story for the very first time and shows how the U. S. may have lost the next big thing to China yet again.

The company behind Snapchat is giving parents a peek into what their teens do on the app but just a bit of a peek. It's part of a larger trend among social media companies, which are under pressure to show they're safe for young users. NPR's Raquel Maria Dillon has more. RAQUEL MARIA DILLON, BYLINE: Atlanta mom Lori Harber knows a good part of her daughter's social life takes place online. And she welcomes the chance to better understand what her 15-year-old is doing on Snapchat. LORI HARBER: I am shocked when I see how many people are on my daughter's Snap and who these people are. DILLON: Harber has never met most of them. Her daughter doesn't know all of them in real life, either. And not all of her child's communications on Snapchat have been pleasant. Harber's just glad her daughter has good judgment. HARBER: I mean, listen. When my daughter came to me and said that a boy asked her for pics - and we all know what they're asking for - she was smart enough to come to me. DILLON: That's exactly the kind of mother-daughter talk that Snapchat's new parental controls are supposed to encourage, says Snap's Nona Farahnik. She's director of platform policy, and she says the app is trying to empower parents to help their teens without making young people feel like Mom or Dad are hovering, just like real-life parenting. NONA FARAHNIK: If your teen is headed to the mall, you might know who they're going there with. You'd ask, how do you know them? Are you guys on a sports team together? Do you guys go to school together? But you won't be sitting there at the mall with them, listening to their conversation. DILLON: Snapchat is hugely popular among teenagers, and the company doesn't want to alienate its users, which is why Snapchat's parental controls only work if kids choose to use them. They have to opt in for their parents to gain access to their list of contacts. Even then, parents can't see the disappearing messages, only who sent them and when. Snapchat is just the latest social media company to give parents more say in how their kids use apps. Irene Ly of Common Sense Media, which reviews apps for families, says there's a clear reason why. IRENE LY: I think these platforms want to show that they do want to take steps to protect kids and that they're capable of doing it themselves, you know, that they can self-regulate without getting the government involved. DILLON: She's skeptical that the tools will actually help parents and kids. So is Josh Golin, executive director at Fairplay, a group that advocates for children's privacy online. He says if social media companies were really concerned about young users, they'd make it easier for kids to put down their phones by offering fewer rewards - things like likes or badges or Snapchat's streaks. JOSH GOLIN: Having a snap streak that you feel like, oh, my God, as a 12-year-old, my life is going to be over if I don't communicate with my friend today on Snapchat - I think that's fostering compulsion. DILLON: Golin says that sort of behavior isn't good for kids, but it sure helps the companies, which get paid by advertisers for those eyeballs on their apps.

DILLON: She's skeptical that the tools will actually help parents and kids. So is Josh Golin, executive director at Fairplay, a group that advocates for children's privacy online. He says if social media companies were really concerned about young users, they'd make it easier for kids to put down their phones by offering fewer rewards - things like likes or badges or Snapchat's streaks. JOSH GOLIN: Having a snap streak that you feel like, oh, my God, as a 12-year-old, my life is going to be over if I don't communicate with my friend today on Snapchat - I think that's fostering compulsion. DILLON: Golin says that sort of behavior isn't good for kids, but it sure helps the companies, which get paid by advertisers for those eyeballs on their apps.

And now a group of experts has released a blueprint full of advice on how to prepare for a possible ransomware attack. We're joined now by NPR cybersecurity correspondent Jenna McLaughlin, and she's going to help us break down the findings. Hi, Jenna. JENNA MCLAUGHLIN, BYLINE: Hey there. SUMMERS: So can we just start off with the basics here? What is ransomware? And I'm also hoping you can give us a sense of the scope of the problem. MCLAUGHLIN: Sure. So ransomware refers to a very popular kind of cybercrime where hackers break into your system, lock it down, and demand payment for the key to unlock it all. It's really actually become a bustling industry. Some groups work on getting access to systems, and they sell that access, while others will write malware or malicious code. The Ransomware Task Force - which was formed in 2021, including stakeholders from government, academia, think tanks and the private sector - actually put together a lot of data about this problem. According to their surveys, victims paid over $600 million to these cybercriminals in just 2021. SUMMERS: Wow. MCLAUGHLIN: And, yeah, 70% of the attacks targeted organizations with 500 or fewer employees. SUMMERS: OK. That is really striking. But what did they suggest then that businesses do about this? MCLAUGHLIN: So it's not so easy to answer since cybercriminals are always adapting. But the task force partnered with the Center for Internet Security to take a stab at it. There's a timeline of actionable things that companies should do. First, it's really important that there's a deep understanding at the company of what your network actually looks like and how it functions on a normal day. It sounds simple, but here's the thing. Experts told me that criminals typically know their victim's networks a lot better than they do. Here's Valicia Stacchetti (ph) from the Center for Internet Security. VALICIA STACCHETTI: There are a lot of attackers out there that I'm sure know the software much, much more comprehensive than probably some other folks, which is not good. And that's why we need this kind of work to make our defenses more resilient. SUMMERS: OK - make our defenses more resilient. Yes. But on a practical level, what does that actually mean? MCLAUGHLIN: So Stacchetti said that her top piece of advice is to use multifactor authentication. It's a fancy way of saying several methods of proving you are who you say you are - so not just a password but also an authenticator application, a physical token, biometrics. You also need to keep your software up to date. Keep an eye on patches that become available. Close up doors and windows that criminals like to break in through, essentially. And train your employees. Make sure they know the basics. The authors of the report recognize that sometimes cybercriminals will get in anyway, even if you're doing everything right. If they do, companies need to know what their plan is ahead of time, and they need to have backups that are encrypted and not connected to their primary network. SUMMERS: All right. So I do not own a business, but none of this sounds cheap. I imagine that if someone has a small- or medium-sized business, they might not have adequate resources to handle this. And as you point out, these criminals are demanding millions of dollars in some cases. MCLAUGHLIN: Yeah, that's a huge concern. So most of the action items in the report are meant to be pretty simple and affordable. But when it comes to actually paying ransoms, that's often when cyber insurance comes in. A new survey from BlackBerry and Corvus Insurance revealed that a lot of businesses are concerned their policies won't cover the cost of the damages, that their premiums are going up and that they aren't actually sure what their policies even cover. I talked to one of the authors of the blueprint, who comes from the insurance industry, and he says that insurance companies should be focused on proactively requiring companies to have some of these safeguards in place, to help defend but also limit really costly payouts in the first place.

That triggered one of the largest refugee crises in history as millions of Muslims moved to Pakistan, while millions of Hindus moved to India. It was a chaotic, violent and profoundly traumatic experience for many. Today, relations between the two countries remain tense, and travel between them is difficult. But the grandson of a man born in Pakistan and raised in India found a way to take his grandfather back to his birthplace virtually. NPR's Lauren Frayer has that story from New Delhi. ISHAR DAS ARORA: School ka (ph) certificate. LAUREN FRAYER, BYLINE: Does it have a date? 1947? An elementary school certificate from the 1940s is all that Ishar Das Arora has left from his hometown in what is now Pakistan. He's from a Hindu family. They were minorities in a Muslim area. And at the time of Partition in 1947, they came under attack. They decided to flee to Hindu-majority India, and they left with only what they could carry, he recalls. ARORA: (Speaking Hindi). FRAYER: \"As we fled, I saw our village go up in flames. All the Hindu houses were set on fire,\" he says. ARORA: (Speaking Hindi). FRAYER: They hid in a cattle shed. Ishar was 8 years old. He remembers his father had a cough, and they worried it would give away their hiding place. But a kind Muslim neighbor, the village chief, protected them. ARORA: (Speaking Hindi). FRAYER: \"He sat atop the roof to fend off mobs of attackers,\" Ishar explains. They survived the night and, the next day, crossed into India. That was the last Ishar saw of his hometown, called Bela, a village surrounded by green hills. ARORA: (Speaking Hindi). FRAYER: \"We used to stand on a hill and shout,\" he says, \"and the last word would echo back. \" That was 75 years ago. Ishar never returned to Pakistan - he couldn't. The two countries are still on a war footing. His family spent time in a refugee camp and later moved to Delhi. Ishar became a civil engineer. He got married, had children and then grandchildren. SPARSH AHUJA: We actually went to a wedding in Amritsar, and that's when he started talking that there was a camp here. FRAYER: That's Ishar's grandson, Sparsh Ahuja. He recalls how, a few years ago, they went to a family wedding near the Pakistan border, and his grandfather suddenly opened up and started talking about this beautiful village called Bela. Sparsh, the grandson, had been studying in the U. K. , where he met Saadia Gardezi, a Pakistani, and they got to talking. SAADIA GARDEZI: It's difficult, for example, for me to visit India. It's hard for them to visit Pakistan. So how can we collaborate to kind of show former refugees their ancestral homes again. FRAYER: Together, with a third friend, Sparsh and Saadia launched a virtual reality project. One of them would go to Pakistan, the other would go to India, and they'd make 3D films for elderly survivors of Partition and for the public. GARDEZI: When you've grown up in India or Pakistan, you have a very one-sided official history. And projects like ours basically help fill the gaps. And we often joke that, you know, if you put together the national curriculums of India and Pakistan, maybe we can have kind of a story of what actually happened and what our actual histories are. FRAYER: So they applied for grant money, got sensitivity training to deal with trauma survivors and pulled out a map of the subcontinent. AHUJA: All I knew was, like, Bela, Jhand. . . FRAYER: Sparsh was able to visit his ancestral village himself because he has an Australian passport. He brought a video camera and a handwritten map from his grandfather. AHUJA: He had, like, drawn a little map of the village. FRAYER: A scribbled map that's a recollection from when he was 8 years old. AHUJA: Yeah. That's all we had. The village. . . FRAYER: You took the piece of paper with you? AHUJA: Yeah, yeah, yeah. FRAYER: Somehow, he found Bela - just a cluster of mud houses and a mosque. Sparsh wanted to find the family of the village chief, the man who guarded his grandfather atop that roof. So he goes up to a woman in the street. AHUJA: I've come from India. This is what I'm looking for. And I show her the scribble. And she's like, OK, well, I don't know if it's the same guy, but, like, that's his house over there. FRAYER: That's his house right there, she says. Sparsh knocks on the door. A man answers. Sparsh tells his story. And the man says, that was my grandfather who saved yours. AHUJA: And then the whole village suddenly came out from, you know. . . FRAYER: He recorded messages from villagers and scenes of what Bela looks like now - the site of old Hindu homes, the school where his grandfather got that certificate. AHUJA: Then I mentioned the story about the hill that echoed, and his son - so the great-grandson was like, I know where that hill is. Like, we call it the speaking hill. And so they took me to that hill. FRAYER: He filmed that, too. The result is a 3D video immersion. . . (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"WOH KAGAZ KI KASHTI\")JAGJIT SINGH: (Singing in non-English language). FRAYER: . . . Into the Pakistani village of Bela, viewed through a virtual reality device. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"WOH KAGHAZ KI KASHTI\")SINGH: (Singing in non-English language). FRAYER: It's like glasses with a thing on the front, and it's got a strap that goes around your head. And you're about to strap this on your granddad's head? Allowing 83-year-old Ishar, in his living room in Delhi, to be transported back to his boyhood. ARORA: Bela village in Jhand. FRAYER: He's in the world of his village right now. . . AHUJA: Yeah. FRAYER: . . . Hearing music and he's seeing. . . AHUJA: The music I've edited because this is a very - his song he sings all the time. FRAYER: And there's some voices now. AHUJA: The village chief's son, who I recorded. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)FRAYER: When the video ends and Ishar takes off the headset, he says Bela is as beautiful as he remembered. ARORA: (Speaking Hindi). FRAYER: \"My school is still there,\" he says, \"and the hills where my voice used to echo. \" Sparsh and Saadia have made dozens of videos like this for survivors and also for the societies they live in because in Sparsh's grandfather's case. . . AHUJA: He was attacked by Muslims and also saved by Muslims. That's not something that fits neatly into the boxes of either Indian or Pakistani, like, national history. And so the more of these stories we cover, the more blurred lines that we create. FRAYER: Blurred lines and borders across this subcontinent. Some of these videos will be on display in museums in India, Pakistan, the U. S. and the U. K. this summer to mark the 75th anniversary of Partition. Lauren Frayer, NPR News, New Delhi.

Wade, as states took aggressive steps to make abortions more difficult to access, abortion-rights advocates started to warn that private online activity could be used to target, discourage or punish those seeking abortion services. Now, critics said that was far-fetched, but those concerns are already playing out in court. According to recent reports, a mother and daughter in Nebraska are facing criminal charges for allegedly performing a self-medicated abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy. That's illegal in that state. Part of law enforcement's evidence against the two women came from online messages collected by Meta, Facebook's parent company, of conversations allegedly referencing abortion medication. This has privacy advocates reiterating their concerns about data privacy, or the lack thereof, on sites like Facebook. So we decided to ask just what privacy controls various platforms offer and how you, a user, can protect your online data. For that, we called Logan Koepke. He is a project director for Upturn. That's a nonprofit that says it investigates ways that technology can reinforce inequities, and it advocates ways to change the status quo. And he is with us now. Welcome. Thank you for joining us. LOGAN KOEPKE: Thanks so much for having me. MARTIN: Here is where I am required to say that Facebook's parent company, Meta, pays NPR to license NPR content. Now, with that disclosure being said, in response to this case, a spokesperson from Meta tweeted that the request from law enforcement didn't mention abortion. And one can imagine that there are other requests for data that might not use the word but which are about reproductive rights and abortion care. Do you think that that has - is the case? I mean, do you think that that is common, I guess would be the question? KOEPKE: So that statement would seem to imply that if the search warrants had mentioned abortion, there would be a different result. But I really do not think that that's true. Unless Meta is going to announce a new policy that they are going to always object to search warrants seeking information in abortion-related investigations, which I don't think they are, that sort of claim that this warrant did not mention anything abortion-related really means nothing. When we see companies resisting legal process or search warrants for user data, usually that's in two different categories. The first category is when there's an overbroad request. That's when law enforcement are obtaining a search warrant that either asks for too much data or data from too many people. And the other kind of request that these companies will frequently fight is if a request seeks the company to either damage or change a product feature in some way. MARTIN: So in response - is it in response to this that earlier this week, Meta announced it was expanding its Messenger app's end-to-end encryption? For people who don't know, can you tell us what end-to-end encryption is? And is this a move that you think is appropriate? KOEPKE: Yeah. So end-to-end encryption adds extra security and protection to your messages. Every device in an end-to-end encrypted conversation has a special key that's basically used to protect the conversation of the two people in that conversation. When you send a message in an end-to-end encrypted conversation - imagine you and I were sending messages - your device locks the message as it's sending, basically. And then that message could only be unlocked by a device that owns one of the special keys for that conversation. So in this instance, on Facebook Messenger, not even Facebook would have the ability to read the messages if end-to-end encrypted messaging was enabled. MARTIN: This is one of those situations where where you stand depends on where you sit in, in a way. But there are, I think, people who would also look at this and say that these platforms are used for, you know, certainly - you know, conspirators in the - say, the January 6 mob attack on the Capitol, just to name one example, are using these apps to communicate with each other. And I think other people might say, well, gee, in situations like that, I do want law enforcement to have access to these messages in building a conspiracy case. How do you balance those concerns - those competing concerns? KOEPKE: So what I would say is that, yes, were end-to-end encrypted messaging on Facebook's messaging services enabled by default, you know, the detectives in this case would not have been able to access the Facebook messages at issue. Even if those messages were encrypted, law enforcement would simply obtain a search warrant to search the cellphone of the mother or daughter in this case, right? Be highly likely that they have the Messenger app on their phone, and law enforcement could simply access the contents of the Facebook Messenger conversation that way. And this is actually something we spend a great deal of time at Upturn researching, which is that more than 2,000 law enforcement agencies across the United States have these tools that are called mobile device forensic tools. And these tools are cellphone extraction tools that are a powerful technology that allow police to extract a full copy of data from your cellphone - so imagine all of your emails, all of your texts, all your photos, all of your locations, app data and more - which can then be searched by law enforcement. So I'd say to someone who's worried that law enforcement won't be able to get access just because Facebook says we're going to deploy end-to-end encrypted messaging across our platform, is that that does not shut the door on law enforcement access, period. The unfortunate reality is that so many of us today have retained so much private information on our phone, and that can still be the subject of a search warrant by law enforcement. MARTIN: And so I think what I hear you saying is, at the end of the day - your individual responsibility to protect your data privacy. I think that's what I hear you saying right now. And so if that's the case, then how do you do that? KOEPKE: There are certainly things companies can do to help protect their users. So it is certainly the case that Facebook deploying end-to-end encryption for Messenger is a positive step and has its own merits on its own terms. There are also policy-based solutions they can pursue, which is saying, hey, we as a platform are not going to retain location data after, you know, let's say 30 days. If an individual is trying to make sure that they can protect themselves and engage in secure communications, there are end-to-end encrypted messaging platforms out there. A popular one is Signal. You can also establish on that application sort of disappearing messages. And if law enforcement apply for a search warrant and sent that search warrant to Signal, for example, there'd be very little data that Signal would be able to provide, right? They could not provide the contents of the messages. They could only provide some high-level metadata about when the user account was created and so on. So that kind of messaging platform is probably what I would recommend for someone who is trying to engage in private and secure communications online. MARTIN: That's Logan Koepke. He's project director for Upturn. That is a nonprofit that advances social justice in technology, governance and design. Logan Koepke, thanks so much for being with us. KOEPKE: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF JOHN BUTLER TRIO SONG, \"BULLET GIRL\") MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:   Even before the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, as states took aggressive steps to make abortions more difficult to access, abortion-rights advocates started to warn that private online activity could be used to target, discourage or punish those seeking abortion services. Now, critics said that was far-fetched, but those concerns are already playing out in court. According to recent reports, a mother and daughter in Nebraska are facing criminal charges for allegedly performing a self-medicated abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy. That's illegal in that state. Part of law enforcement's evidence against the two women came from online messages collected by Meta, Facebook's parent company, of conversations allegedly referencing abortion medication. This has privacy advocates reiterating their concerns about data privacy, or the lack thereof, on sites like Facebook. So we decided to ask just what privacy controls various platforms offer and how you, a user, can protect your online data. For that, we called Logan Koepke. He is a project director for Upturn. That's a nonprofit that says it investigates ways that technology can reinforce inequities, and it advocates ways to change the status quo. And he is with us now. Welcome. Thank you for joining us.

S. so it can rely less on places like China and Taiwan. But experts warn this will be a long and complicated process. NPR's Emily Feng visited a chip factory in the U. S. to understand more. EMILY FENG, BYLINE: The first thing Adam Milton has me do when I get to Wolfspeed's gleaming, new factory in upstate New York is cover my shoes. ADAM MILTON: Yeah. So for all of our employees, we want to keep the salt, the mud, the nastiness of the Northeast outside and keep it away from our campus. FENG: Milton's an operations vice president who helped set up this $1. 2 billion factory. By the end of this year, it will be shipping out silicon carbide wafers. That's the material that semiconductor chips are printed and etched onto. Then those chips go into our electric cars and industrial gadgets. We peek inside the clean room where Wolfspeed makes its transparent wafers. Engineers and technicians in bunny suits - covering everything from head, face to toe - work in these perfectly regulated environments. MILTON: That's not necessarily to protect the people. The people are already safe in this environment. It's to keep, you know, bodily particles and shedding of things - keep it away from the product. FENG: Once the factory opens for production at the end of this year, it will run around-the-clock. So when this gets up and running at 2 a. m. , there are people in bunny suits working this place. MILTON: There are people here 24/7 - absolutely. FENG: Wolfspeed is a manufacturing company with technology the U. S. wants to stay in the U. S. That's part of what the CHIPS Act aims to do. The act appropriates about $80 billion - now ready to go - in the form of tax credits, incentives and matching federal grants to chip makers if they build in the U. S. and not China. It then directs Congress to approve another $200 billion over the next five years for research. STEPHEN EZELL: That matters because, you know, for years the U. S. federal government invested more in R & D as a share of our GDP than any other country in the world. Now we have fallen to ninth. FENG: Stephen Ezell is a vice president at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. It's a nonprofit research institute focused on technologies like the semiconductor space. China has criticized the CHIPS Act as a threat to free trade. Ezell disagrees. EZELL: Some have called that industrial subsidies. Our view of it is different. When you look around the world - Korea, Taiwan, China, Israel - virtually all of these countries offer incentive packages, whose intent is to defray, to some extent, the 10s of billions of dollars it can cost to build a new fab. FENG: But building from scratch also takes time. Just to give you an example, Wolfspeed's process began in 2013. That's when the State University of New York's Polytechnic Institute helped fund an entire industrial campus. Milton says the state built the roads, water supply and even a power substation. Chipmaking needs super stable energy supply with multiple backups, which New York State provided. MILTON: Just about three miles north of here is a main power station for a lot of New York as well as the Northeast. And so it's actually got redundant feeds from Niagara Falls, from nuclear energy coming from Canada, from other solar plants and wind turbines across the Northeast. FENG: Wolfspeed's New York factory is at 300 employees now, but they want to double that. Rex Felton, global operations VP at Wolfspeed, says hiring skilled technicians and engineers is a bottleneck. Even with the Polytechnic Institute nearby providing lots of talent, bolstering science and engineering education will help long term. REX FELTON: I think every company that does semiconductors today runs into that. We're starting relatively slow. We're going to grow very quickly, and I think it's going to continue to be something we're going to have to work on. FENG: One of the two bills that were combined to create the final CHIPS Act included immigration reform to lift green card caps for foreign-born graduates and make it easier for highly skilled immigrants to stay. But that part didn't make it into the final law. Wolfspeed is also just one part of an extremely complex supply chain. There are companies that only design chips, others that make them, others that create the tools to etch and deposit materials on Wolfspeed's wafers and, finally, other companies still to test and package the finished chips. Here's Milton again. MILTON: But one of the big drivers for our business going forward is the electrification of the automobile industry. And so with more and more companies seeing the benefit of going electric, they want to work with Wolfspeed. FENG: And some of the biggest car companies that are buying from Wolfspeed at the moment are Chinese. The point is not to make semiconductor chips all American, but to create the conditions whereby the most critical and advanced steps of the process are once again U. S. dominated.

DEEN: Well, it certainly has brought a whole new host of challenges, that's for sure. Like a lot of companies in our situation - you know, getting starting out, still considered startups - it's been a pretty exciting time, you know, pre this privacy change, to be able to get off the ground in a relatively easy manner by, you know, finding customers, especially, as you mentioned, through apps like Facebook and being able to do pretty efficient advertising there. And where we've seen changes, is - you know, is. . . SIMON: You've been able to direct your advertising to people who have expressed what you're convinced is some interest that might make them receptive to your smoothie packets. DEEN: Yeah, absolutely. And, you know, the changes now is that basically that advertising works a lot, you know, less than it did before. It's less efficient. It costs us more. SIMON: Of course, we want to disclose that Apple is among NPR's financial supporters, and Facebook's parent company, Meta, pays NPR to license NPR content. I understand it might make business tougher for you, but aren't a lot of people maybe justifiably concerned about their privacy? DEEN: Oh, no question about it. And I don't think any business, you know, Kencko included, disagrees in any way, shape or form with the direction and, you know, the movement of people having more control over their data and privacy. There's no question about that. It just means, as a marketer, which is what I - my day job, outside of being, you know, a consumer that definitely cares deeply about my data and my privacy - just means as a marketer, we have to go about it different ways and look for new ways to efficiently find, you know, customers and switch up our playbook a little bit, looking for those channels, doing lots of testing - lots of test and learn - to figure out a mix that can be more effective for us. And that's exactly what we've been doing, really, you know, since the tide started to turn last year. SIMON: May I ask, how many platforms do you have to buy ads on? Can you tell us? DEEN: Oh, goodness. Right now, you know, we're probably spread out across five or six at any given time. And then we - I kind of go with the 80-20 rule. You know, we spend about 80% of our budget on things we know that are working and working well and 20% on testing new things, and we're always testing new things. So if you took the test pieces out of it, it's probably about five or six. SIMON: I don't think I've ever seen an ad for your product.

And that's exactly what we've been doing, really, you know, since the tide started to turn last year. SIMON: May I ask, how many platforms do you have to buy ads on? Can you tell us? DEEN: Oh, goodness. Right now, you know, we're probably spread out across five or six at any given time. And then we - I kind of go with the 80-20 rule. You know, we spend about 80% of our budget on things we know that are working and working well and 20% on testing new things, and we're always testing new things. So if you took the test pieces out of it, it's probably about five or six. SIMON: I don't think I've ever seen an ad for your product. DEEN: Well, we'll have to make sure that we find you somehow, some way, one of these days. Without that tracking, I guess I can't go and hunt you down. SIMON: That's Kencko's vice president for marketing, Kelly Deen. Thank you so much for being with us. DEEN: My pleasure.

Well, it could be one of thousands of fraudulent ads that have infiltrated sites like LinkedIn. Jasmine Robinson is a job seeker in Long Island, N. Y. And back in June, she came across a posting for a writing job at a company calling itself Obsidian Entertainment. JASMINE ROBINSON: They had a bunch of documents that all looked very legit. I did a text interview over an app called Wire. I had a phone interview that was also maybe about 20, 25 minutes. And, like, everything just moved really, really quickly. RASCOE: Robinson received an offer letter and was told she could make $55 an hour. Next came direct deposit forms and a sweetener, a check for around $8,000. Supposedly, it was to buy work-from-home equipment. ROBINSON: I've never felt so crazy before. Just constantly asking my family members, asking my husband, asking my friends, like, is this fake? Like, this has to be fake, right? And they're all saying, no, no no. It's real. Like, look at the email. Everything looks on the up and up. RASCOE: But Robinson went with her gut and researched scams online. She realized she was being taken for a ride. Even though she didn't lose any money, she still had to close her bank account and cancel all of her cards because she had given up her personal information. To get a better understanding of the problem, we reached out to Haywood Talcove. He specializes in these kinds of identity theft scams. HAYWOOD TALCOVE: It's the great American fraud. Because of COVID, more and more people have been searching for jobs online, using services like LinkedIn. And all of a sudden, they see an opportunity that looks absolutely phenomenal. It pays significantly more than they've ever seen, and they put in their resume. And the next thing you know, they get an email back. They get a Zoom link, and they go through the interview process. And then a few days later, they get an email. Congratulations. You are our candidate. I just need you to fill out some very simple paperwork. Please give us your name, your date of birth, your Social Security number, your bank account and permission to run a credit check. And unsuspectingly, the person didn't get a job, and they've been robbed. RASCOE: So, I mean, right now, job seekers are going to listen to this. They're going to be worried about getting scammed. Like, what can you do? Obviously, I'm guessing that one thing we will say is if the job is too good to be true, if it's paying you $60 an hour to work at, like, a fast food place, it's probably not real. Well, I'm sure some of these - they may tailor it to make it look kind of real, right? What should you look out for? TALCOVE: So the first thing you want to do is if you get the job offer, you want to look up the company, and you want to call the central number. So if you happen to see a LexisNexis job opening on LinkedIn and you're fortunate enough to be selected, just call the 800 number and get transferred to the person. That stops 80% of it. If you get an email from the, quote, unquote \"recruiter,\" and it doesn't have the domain of the company that you're applying for, ask them for an email address at the domain. Sometimes, companies use third-party contractors. But they should be able to very simply do that. If they don't want to give it to you or they have some other reason, big red flag. And then the third thing - when they ask you for all that information - your name and your address and your social and your bank account number - what you want to do is say, I would prefer, if possible, to do that in person and just provide it to your HR person. No one's just emailing an application with all that information into an email address with a domain that doesn't match the company. Unless you can do those three things, it's likely fraud.

One man in Michigan is building his own high-speed service to help neighbors who still rely on dial-up. NPR's Emma Bowman reports. EMMA BOWMAN, BYLINE: Before the pandemic forced many of us to work from home, Jared Mauch had been at it for almost 20 years. But his hunt for good internet was unending. When he first moved to rural Michigan in a town not far from Ann Arbor, his job set him up with a great internet connection, while many of his neighbors were still stuck in the slow days of dial-up. JARED MAUCH: My company provided a T1 line, which was really great. It's 1. 5 megabit up and down. BOWMAN: But that was 2002. MAUCH: And eventually, over time, as the number of children we had grew and as the business activities that I did for my employers, this really was no longer meeting my needs. BOWMAN: But when he started shopping around, he wasn't happy with his options. The internet speeds from AT&T were painfully slow. Comcast wanted to charge him an upfront fee of $50,000. He opted for a third route. Rather than shell out money, only to have to depend on the whims of an internet service provider, he started his own fiber ISP. MAUCH: It ended up being a 10-year project. I ended up creating the company eventually in 2017, getting permits in 2019, sent out letters to everyone, let them know that, you know, construction was going to be starting. BOWMAN: In August of 2020, he was officially in business, just in time for his kids to start virtual school during the pandemic. MAUCH: And it was great. I have this fiber at my home that I controlled and could deliver the type of service that I really wanted to have. BOWMAN: Along the way, he also hooked up neighbors to his fiber line, and those neighbors told their neighbors. Now he's got 70 customers. The federal government, meanwhile, has been pouring billions into fiber infrastructure in recent years, especially in unserved rural areas, where experts say the Comcasts and AT&Ts of the world often aren't expanding because they don't see a return on investment. But Gary Bolton, CEO of the Fiber Broadband Association, says people like Mauch aren't waiting around for governments to get the money needed to get decent internet. GARY BOLTON: You have these rugged individuals we could call mavericks that have gone out to see how they can solve an issue with their community and set up broadband connection to their home and then to their neighbors. You know, some of them have been able to build it without government assistance. BOWMAN: In all, Mauch says he spent about $300,000 out of his own pocket building his service. MAUCH: I managed to sign up enough customers along the way that I've been breaking even. My goal wasn't necessarily to make a lot of money doing this but be able to connect to people that really needed it. BOWMAN: But now those federal funds are flowing. Mauch is getting $2. 6 million to continue his work, thanks to a COVID-19 relief package that allocated $15 million to the county of Washtenaw, where Mauch lives. With that money, Mauch plans to get 600 more homes connected, about a quarter of the work that needs to be done to get his county to 100% reliable internet. He usually charges about $200 for installation, with monthly rates starting at $65. He tries to keep his prices fair. MAUCH: Some people have the means to support the projects, and some people don't. And I've adapted my approach for every person in how I market to the homes and when I interact with them. BOWMAN: And at least for now, he seems to be keeping his neighbors happy. MAUCH: So far, I've lost zero customers. Everybody that's gotten connected has stayed connected. BOWMAN: Emma Bowman, NPR News.

The country, like others in Europe, relies heavily on Russian gas. And some worry that Moscow could turn off the tap this winter to punish the EU for sanctions imposed over the war in Ukraine. Already, gas flows to Germany are down, so Germans are trying to conserve energy ahead of winter by dimming lights, taking cold showers and installing DIY solar panels. NPR's Bobby Allyn has the story from Berlin. BOBBY ALLYN, BYLINE: There's no major industrialized country in the world more dependent on Russian energy than Germany. Natural gas, mostly from Russia, is used to heat about half of the country's households. Karolina Attspodina moved to Berlin from Ukraine 10 years ago. KAROLINA ATTSPODINA: I'm pretty frustrated, and I think not just me. I think a lot of the people are - that how could we get it to this stage, that we're so reliant on somebody else and especially Russia? ALLYN: Attspodina resents that Germany has no choice but to keep buying energy from Russia. So she started a DIY solar panel company to fight against Germany's dependence on Russia. ATTSPODINA: I can see, you know, my people dying over at home. I still have family and friends there. ALLYN: Making her startup more meaningful to her now - it's called We Do Solar. It sells solar panels for city apartments to be installed on balconies or garages or roofs. If they collect enough solar power, Attspodina says, they can reduce the utility bill by 25%. In an energy crisis, that appealed to many Germans. ATTSPODINA: Around the invasion, we saw a huge spike of interest. So around 70%, our sales went up. ALLYN: Attspodina is now racing to keep up with sales. Even though regulations limit the amount of power her solar panels can generate, she has a backlog of 3,000 orders she's now trying to fill. ATTSPODINA: This is a way for you to actually reduce your energy bill, but also reduce CO2 and help our climate crisis and obviously help the fact that we are reliant on the Russian gas. ALLYN: Across Germany, the government is taking its own steps to try to reduce the country's energy consumption - dimming lights in public places, cranking down the heat of public pools, turning off water fountains. Some cities are even considering turning off traffic lights if they're not in highly populated areas. While Russia has been gradually sending less gas to Europe in response to Western sanctions, in Germany, some fear that Russia will completely cut off gas exports to the country. That would make a painful energy crunch even worse, says Fabian Ronningen, senior analyst with Rystad Energy. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)FABIAN RONNINGEN: The energy crisis will last as long as prices are very high. And Germany remains dependent on Russian gas, which will not be a short-term thing. ALLYN: In Berlin, one of her customers, Leo von Bismarck, recently installed the solar panels at his parent's house in the city's posh Mitte neighborhood. As we looked at the eight black panels Velcroed to the outside of the balcony, von Bismarck said they were appealing because they double as a privacy screen. But he's happy about the cost savings, too. LEO VON BISMARCK: Some people are just paralyzed by the urge to do something, but at the same time not knowing how to do it. And this is really plug and play, to be honest. Like, it's as simple as that. ALLYN: Easy for a von Bismarck to say. For many Germans, the $1,300 euro cost of buying the cheapest set is simply out of reach. Just ask Lydia Dietsch. She's a graphic designer in Berlin who says there is no way she could afford them. At the same time, her utility bill recently delivered some sticker shock. She lives with her partner and her roommate. LYDIA DIETSCH: Price has already increased from, like, 91 euros per month to 410 per month. ALLYN: For Dietsch - she's not turning to solar panels to cut back, but rather, she's taking shorter showers, sometimes cold showers, and. . . DIETSCH: Trying to avoid cooking with the gas often and use other things instead. Like, we have a grill, or, I don't know, just try to cook alternatively. ALLYN: As she and the rest of the country brace for the coming winter, she says she might have no choice but to shiver her way through it. DIETSCH: Yeah, I'm afraid of winter. I don't know what will happen. We will just be in the cold rooms, I guess. ALLYN: Or maybe, she says, she'll find a friend who's managed to heat their home with solar panels.

I'm Andrea's sister Cynthia (ph). On today's show, we're going to be real about this summer's hottest new social media app - also, why smell is so powerful. All right. Let's start the show. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ANDREA GUTIERREZ, HOST:  Hello, hello. You're listening to IT'S BEEN A MINUTE from NPR. I'm Andrea Gutierrez. ELISE HU, HOST:  And I'm Elise Hu. We are your guest hosts this week. GUTIERREZ: And now, it's time to be real. HU: Andrea, I always think you're being real. GUTIERREZ: Aw, thank you. I think you're being real, too. HU: So real. GUTIERREZ: We're talking about the app. Maybe you've heard of it, maybe you haven't. Either way, it's getting all kinds of attention this summer, and it's called BeReal. HU: The name kind of says it all, right? The promise is authenticity. GUTIERREZ: Elise, I'm going to be honest. I've been hearing about BeReal all summer, but I haven't actually downloaded it yet. HU: OK. It's worth a shot. So how about you go do that, and I'll take it from here? GUTIERREZ: All right. See you later. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)HU: So for those of you who haven't heard of it, let me break it down. The app sends a push notification, an alert, to all of its users at the exact same time. And then we users have about 2 minutes to post a photo of whatever it is we're doing, wherever we are at that moment. No thrills, frills or makeup if you're not already wearing it because it's a photo of you and what you're looking at. HALEY NAHMAN: It gets your front camera and your back camera. HU: That's Hailey Nahman. She's a podcaster and writer of the popular newsletter on modern life called Maybe Baby. NAHMAN: And the idea, the sales pitch, is kind of you understand what your friends are up to in a more kind of grounded in the moment, unplanned way. RYAN BRODERICK: I always compare it to Wordle. HU: And that's Ryan Broderick. He's also a podcaster who writes the newsletter Garbage Day on the latest trends of online life. BRODERICK: That's sort of my comparison, where it's like this thing you do once a day and then you forget about it. I have never successfully hit the push alert at the right time. I don't know why. I just - I miss it every single time. NAHMAN: (Laughter). HU: So BeReal, it's another social media app that promises to connect us. It's a game. It's all of the above. But what does its popularity say about what we want from social media now? And as we've become increasingly disillusioned - my hand's up - with the promise of social media, how authentic can we really be online? Well, Haley, Ryan and I are going to get into those questions. But first, out of the three of us, who among us is on BeReal and who isn't? NAHMAN: I'm not. BRODERICK: I tried, and I very quickly lost interest. (LAUGHTER)HU: Ryan, what have you taken a picture of? Like, what stands out to you in terms of what you've done on BeReal? BRODERICK: Well, I was on vacation in Italy, so I was very interested in bragging. . . HU: Oh, not fair. BRODERICK: . . . About that. And then I stopped using it entirely when I went back to my normal life (laughter). HU: I have taken a photo of my laptop screen the last three days, I think. So you're welcome for that content, my four followers. NAHMAN: It's very ethical of you, Elise. HU: (Laughter). NAHMAN: And if you're late, it says that you did not post in the allotted time. BRODERICK: Yes. It shames you. NAHMAN: Yeah. You're shamed. (LAUGHTER)HU: So that is to say that it's important for the app designers - or it's an idea baked into the app that they decide when you take an image. The user doesn't decide. BRODERICK: Right. NAHMAN: Yes. HU: And what do you think the point of that is? BRODERICK: My gut is that it's trying to subvert influencers - you know, these people who on TikTok and Instagram will take, like, extremely elaborate, aspirational, like, you know, very prim and proper photos. They don't want you to do that. They want you to just take a photo on the fly and add it to the feed. NAHMAN: Right. No pretenses, no planning, no deciding when the right moment is in your life to highlight - I think that's the sales pitch at least. BRODERICK: Yeah. It's very hard to pose with my Nescafe coffee, which is. . . HU: (Laughter). BRODERICK: . . . My sponsor this month, when I only have 2 minutes to plan. HU: Just to be clear, Ryan is not sponsored by Nescafe. NAHMAN: (Laughter). HU: So what's y'all's take on it? Is it a healthier approach? NAHMAN: I don't doubt at all that it's entertaining and maybe refreshing in certain ways as a kind of opposing approach to Instagram, where everything's starting to feel, like, way too edited and filtered. HU: Yeah. NAHMAN: Where my, like, cynicism comes in, I guess, is basically in the marketing. The idea - even in the name BeReal, this idea that we're supposed to immediately buy into that being prompted by your phone to take a photo is necessarily going to reveal some sort of truth or reality about your life. HU: Right. NAHMAN: I think oftentimes, like, a lot of social platforms have these really lofty kind of PR-spun missions about how they're going to connect people and, like, help you share your life. And as we've seen with most other platforms, that doesn't really end up being the product. It's not really what they're selling, and it's not what's being sold. So I just have some cynicism about BeReal's entire premise. HU: Let's dig in on that, right? Let's dig in on the premise of BeReal. Do we expect the social internet as something that helps us reveal the truth? - because a lot of tweets on this have said things like, I would never go on BeReal; the internet is for being fake. Right? Like, it is a norm that the internet is fake. And so is BeReal kind of a solution in search of a problem or is it nostalgic? Is it going back or trying to go back to a kind of internet that never really existed? BRODERICK: Well, I do think it's, like, very interesting. I hadn't thought about this until I was doing interviews for a piece on BeReal and, like, a young woman I was talking to mentioned this - where, yes, BeReal is \"authentic,\" quote-unquote, but it can be very toxic when people are glamorous on it. It's almost worse. The person I was talking to sort of described it as this feeling of, like, discovering your friends are actually much wealthier than you or more interesting. . . HU: Or less boring, yeah. BRODERICK: . . . Or more - yeah, less boring. And it is this interesting way of - yeah, you're flipping the idea of, like, everyone's a celebrity on Instagram, and Instagram is your personal reality show, but then it's giving you this window into other people's lives that is almost sometimes more uncomfortable because you think, like, oh, like, I look like a slob right now. But how do you not look like a slob? NAHMAN: I asked my subscribers recently who use BeReal how they felt about the app experience, and a lot of people said that they've noticed the competitiveness starting to sneak into it, like, so quickly. They said that they're scrambling to take an aesthetic photo in 2 minutes, like, they have - they're already subverting the entire premise, and, like, as their circles are getting wider on BeReal, it's no longer kind of the fun, intimate thing it started as. And it's funny that so quickly with the app's popularity - the rise in popularity - it's kind of caving to all the pitfalls of the other apps that it was supposedly. . . HU: Yeah, the same tendencies, right? NAHMAN: Right. HU: BeReal, which is supposed to have no aesthetic - like, the whole point is for it to just not be gamified somehow is already being gamified. Is that what you're saying? NAHMAN: Yeah, exactly. I mean, even if nobody figured out how to gamify it, it would still be sort of random, right? It's coming at a random time. It might catch you at a boring moment or a more interesting moment. You have no control over that. People - I got some comments of people saying that they were really bummed that the push notification would come when they were doing something boring, when, like, they had just been outside reading by a pool and things like that, where it's, like - at a certain point, you're, like, becoming even more neurotic. Like, you're chained to your phone in this new way. HU: Yeah, because the app could signal us at any moment. It just makes us more lab rats, right? Like - or it could - a cynical take would be that - right? - that because we know that BeReal could ping us at any moment, then shouldn't I spend more time outside by the pool making my life look great? BRODERICK: Yeah. I do think it kind of adds this, like, weird, metacontextual idea of our lives. But I do - I don't know - I always sort of question whenever, like, young people use the internet - part of me always just, like, remembers when I was a young person using the internet. . . NAHMAN: Those young people. Yeah. BRODERICK: Yeah. And, like, I didn't take any of it seriously. So, like, whenever I read, sort of like - I never want to be the older person being like, teenagers are having their minds melted by the internet. It's, like, I assume the average BeReal user has, like, 15 people they follow. And, like, once classes start in college again, like, they're just not going to touch it. Like, it's just, like, a summer app that, like, will disappear. NAHMAN: I think so, too. BRODERICK: Yeah. That's my gut. NAHMAN: It's a blip. I don't know if you saw this in the news, but I think Facebook just introduced something called a candid challenge. HU: Oh. BRODERICK: It's over, baby. It's already done, yeah. NAHMAN: It's - yeah, that's the death knell. Instagram always just - this is, like, the classic move, but. . . HU: Cannibalizes it, yeah. NAHMAN: Yeah, yeah. BRODERICK: I do want to push just a little and say, like, I do think there's a couple key trends that, like, BeReal has, like, brought to light that won't go away even if BeReal dies. HU: Yeah, let's broaden it out. BRODERICK: Yeah, so, like, BeReal - I think the biggest thing is it's not Instagram, which is where your parents are now. So, like, that's really very - that's going to be increasingly important in the same way that, you know, I don't use Facebook anymore. So, like, the new generation - they're not going to touch Meta products. I also think that, like, the new generation of internet users - if you look at, like, the trends and how they're using the internet, they typically don't love public feeds. And if they do use public feeds, they don't use their real names, or, like, they have, like, nine different accounts for, you know, every K-pop band they like or something, right? Like they're using multiple identities to interact. And I also think that, like, there's just a massive generational shift about, you know, what you could call, like, life data - this idea that you have an Instagram grid with your vacation photos, and they're going to live there forever. They don't seem interested in that stuff. And you can see this in, like, their love of Twitch or their love of Discord or their love of TikTok, which is not really a traditional social network in the same way that, like, Facebook is asking you to update your bio, right? So I think all of those things are here to stay. And BeReal kind of hit this, like, perfect moment where it was summertime. There's stuff to do. There's not a lot going on. And it offered enough of those things that it was pretty sticky. HU: Yeah. Some of the aspects that you talk about - Ryan, especially - just about returning to a more intimate internet, a more anonymized internet, where you use handles instead of your actual name and identity, and you don't have a brand because you're hidden. It actually harkens to the very beginnings of the internet - right? - like AIM and IRC, where you never used your real name. So it's kind of like everything old is new again. NAHMAN: Life is a circle. BRODERICK: Right, yeah. It always just - it's the 15-year rule, right? But I do think that, like, BeReal does tap into this idea of, like, the internet is something you experience with, like, the closest 20 people in your life, which is very, like - it goes very against the millennial idea of, like - I'm verified on Twitter, and here's my LinkedIn. It's, like, this different idea, where you're not putting yourself out into public spaces online. You might be anonymous when you are, but you're spending a lot more time in, you know, Snapchat, sharing TikToks on iMessage, or if you're outside of America, WhatsApp. But, like, I think those sort of dark social, as it's called, like, areas seem to be where more activity's happening, which makes me think that, like, BeReal, because it uses your contact list when you start it - like, maybe that's why it blew up, is because all of a sudden, like, the 30 closest people in your phone book are just there. And you can just port that over. NAHMAN: I think I can see what you mean, Ryan, about, like, the more intimate internet experience being interesting. I think the problem with BeReal, of course, is that it's not really integrating with our lives the way that I think some of those other intimate spaces - like, you know, like, WhatsApp or Discord or even just, like, iMessage, where I spend most of my time on my phone - they feel like they really integrate with my relationships. They feel supplemental. They can never replace it, but they're just, like, this little funny side project, whereas BeReal feels like it's kind of forcing itself into your life in a way that doesn't feel sustainable. BRODERICK: Yeah, I agree. HU: So the broad question is, can social media meaningfully help humans connect, as it promises? BRODERICK: I think absolutely. I am optimistic. I think it is good. And I think the major issue that we have right now is that there's, like, five companies. They run the internet. And the way that we feel using the internet would be the same way we felt if, you know, we only had a Walmart to go to in our town. It would be the same way we felt if instead of public parks, we only had the option between being alone or going to Coachella, right? Like, there's no version of the internet that makes good business sense at the moment that emphasizes the local, emphasizes the regional, emphasizes the personal because it's run by monopolies that want to take away our ability to leave their walled gardens. They want to monopolize our time, our attention, our emotions, our data. But there's - if you, like, were to close your eyes and think nostalgically about the best times you've had online, chances are you were in some kind of digital environment that had less than 100 people in it. I'm going to guess. It's just human nature. We don't want to be forced to, like, fight each other in a Hunger Games all day, you know? It's just not fun. And so I am optimistic, though, that, you know - and I kind of pin it on the pandemic, where we all had group chats to stay in touch with each other. We. . . HU: Yeah, that's true - the pandemic group chats. BRODERICK: Yeah, we worked on Zoom and, like, drank on Zoom and did all those other things. Like, we had these local networks we built. And they didn't go away like I thought they would. I sort of thought, like, OK, pandemic's, quote-unquote, \"over. \" Time to go back to the way things were. We're not. So now we've kind of integrated ourselves into the internet in a way that was bound to happen, but I think it just sped up. And right now we're carving out different ways of not feeling insane online, because I think we can all kind of agree that being online is fun, and it matters, and it drives culture, and it makes things interesting. But the big thing we have to fix is the fact that, like, there are five companies, most of which are owned by, like, weird men, dictating how we use the internet. And, like, what if that wasn't true? What if it was more local? What if it was more flexible? What if it was more natural? NAHMAN: I think we keep turning to tech to, like - we've often seen it as, like, sort of this parallel to the physical world. Like, we could have representations of all these things on the internet, right? Like, magazines became websites. Clubhouses or clubs became, like, chat rooms. Like, we really were trying to create these digital analogues for everything. And what we've come to with social media and social platforms is just this attempt to commodify, like, human connection. And we keep trying to do it in interesting and new ways and, you know, in higher fidelity ways with, like, Meta. And I think what we're failing to see is that there is basically a flaw in this entire project. These digital landscapes - they're too literal and objective. They're too two-dimensional to really capture humanity. And they keep sort of spiraling us down a path that's - doesn't really feel like it's building towards anything meaningful, at least to me. Your vision, Ryan, of the internet being, like, more hyperlocal does appeal to me, but I still think that - I still wish, I guess, that we had more minds who were looking to create or solve for, like, social problems offline or at least using technology more as a sort of tool than a kind of end environment, if that makes sense. HU: Yeah, I hear you there. In the meantime, we will be watching for the demise or the acquisition of BeReal. BRODERICK: Yeah. HU: Thank you so much, Haley and Ryan. Would y'all be down to stick around and play a game with me? BRODERICK: Absolutely. NAHMAN: I'm in. HU: All right. You sound so excited (laughter). Coming up, who said that? (SOUNDBITE OF FLEVANS' \"FLICKER\")HU: All right, and we are back to play a game called, Who Said That? NAHMAN: I'm nervous. HU: Here's how it works. I will share a quote with you that you might have heard in the news this week, and you can guess either who said that or what it's about. There's no buzzers. You just yell out the answer. BRODERICK: OK. HU: As usual, you win nothing. Zero prizes - just bragging rights. NAHMAN: All right. BRODERICK: Excellent, perfect. NAHMAN: I'm ready. HU: OK, here's the first quote. Fill in the blank - for he knew the cold truth. The only thing that could tear down blank was itself. BRODERICK: Oh. NAHMAN: No. BRODERICK: \"House Of The Dragon. \"(SOUNDBITE OF VICTORY TUNE)NAHMAN: Oh. HU: That is a quote from the opening scene. NAHMAN: Wow. BRODERICK: Yes, I - yes. NAHMAN: I didn't watch. BRODERICK: It's good. I was skeptical going in, but I liked it. HU: In \"House Of The Dragon\" - Ryan, tell everyone who doesn't know what \"House Of The Dragon\" is. BRODERICK: It is the new \"Game Of Thrones\" prequel spinoff-y (ph) thing on HBO. NAHMAN: Very divisive on Twitter, I'm seeing. BRODERICK: Yes, yes. HU: Super divisive - Twitter, one of the places where Haley still kind of hangs out in social media. NAHMAN: Oh, I still hang around. I'm not that noble. HU: So the show premiered last Sunday, and the first episode drew 9. 99 million viewers, which is the biggest series premiere ever for HBO. And the quote I just read from comes from Princess - how do we say her first name? BRODERICK: Rhaneera (ph)? Rhanayra (ph)? HU: Yes. BRODERICK: Something like that? It's all, like, Ragar (ph) and Arnar (ph) and Aemond - I can't keep them all straight, and I've read the books. I can't keep them all straight. HU: Sounds right. Sounds right. All right - one point for Ryan. So this means that, Haley, you still have - you have - you still have a chance of coming from behind and win this. NAHMAN: All right, all right. HU: . . . 'Cause it's three quotes. NAHMAN: I'm stretching. HU: OK, next quote - sometimes people say you've only publicly been with women, and I don't think I've publicly been with anyone. If someone takes. . . NAHMAN: Harry Styles. (SOUNDBITE OF VICTORY TUNE)NAHMAN: I interrupted with my buzzer. HU: I needed to be doing this in a British accent, really, 'cause that could have made it easier. But clearly, it didn't need to be any easier for you. This clue was so easy. All right, sometimes people say you've only publicly been with women, and I don't think I've publicly been with anyone. If someone takes a picture of you with someone, it doesn't mean you're choosing to have a public relationship or something. All right, Haley, context please. NAHMAN: Yes, this is Harry Styles as a response to being accused of queerbaiting by playing with gender and how he dresses and presenting as straight in paparazzi photos. HU: Lots of the LGBTQI community have been debating whether his statements fall into that category. What are your thoughts? Do you think he's queerbaiting? NAHMAN: I don't know. I have no idea. And I don't know how useful it is to debate about it - not here on this podcast. I'm not, like, accusing you. I'm just - I just wonder if it's the time best spent - like, if it leads towards liberation for anyone. I'm not sure. HU: Cool. Oh, well, you know what? The bigger point here is that you two are now tied up. NAHMAN: Whew. HU: All right, 1-1 - for the win here or the tie - we can end in a draw. We're going to play you a sound. This is very special. This is unique on IT'S BEEN A MINUTE. We're going to play you a sound, and you're going to guess where this sound is coming from. Are you all ready? BRODERICK: Yeah. Let's do it. (SOUNDBITE OF A BLACK HOLE)BRODERICK: Oh, buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz. . . NAHMAN: I know what this is. BRODERICK: . . . Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz. NAHMAN: I know too. I was waiting until the end. HU: Somebody just yell it out, just yell it out. NAHMAN: Space. BRODERICK: It's a NASA video of a galaxy. It's a gaseous galaxy making noise, yeah. (SOUNDBITE OF A BLACK HOLE)NAHMAN: The sound of space. BRODERICK: Yeah. HU: I'm giving it both - I'm giving it to both of you. But Haley should get the point for how succinct her answer was 'cause Haley just goes space. BRODERICK: It's space, yeah. HU: And then Ryan's, like, it's sourced from NASA. It's a gaseous (laughter). . . BRODERICK: I don't - yeah, I - all I remember is that this is what gas sounds like in space if there's too much of it, which I thought was funny. HU: You both got it. I'm giving you a half point each to tie it up. That was awesome. NAHMAN: I'm happy - 1 1/2? HU: Yeah, so 1 1/2 each. NAHMAN: Good - we're good competition. BRODERICK: Yeah, absolutely. HU: Yeah, that was the sound of a black hole that NASA released this week. I didn't know black holes even had sounds because I thought, like, the nature of the black hole was that kind of - it was anti-matter. NAHMAN: I saw a tweet of someone saying, oh, that's cool. It just sounds like a million souls trapped in hell. HU: (Laughter). NAHMAN: It's really promising. HU: Haley, we would have accepted that as the answer too - a million souls trapped in hell. NAHMAN: It's actually a good way to end the episode on BeReal. BRODERICK: Yeah, that's true. That is very true. HU: We have come full circle once again. We have come full black hole. All right, that was awesome. You tied. Both of you tied. Thanks again to worthy competitors Haley Nahman and Ryan Broderick. NAHMAN: Thank you so much. It's so nice to meet you both. BRODERICK: Thank you. Yeah. Woo. HU: Woo. Coming up, COVID has made us more aware of the power of smell, but it's still underappreciated. My co-host, Andrea Gutierrez, talks to someone who says it's past time for smell to get its cultural moment. (SOUNDBITE OF FLEVANS' \"FLICKER\")HU: You're listening to IT'S BEEN A MINUTE from NPR. I'm Elise Hu. GUTIERREZ: And I'm Andrea Gutierrez. Elise, I don't know about you, but this time of year is always oddly emotional for me. HU: Why is that? GUTIERREZ: Well, fall is right around the corner. School is starting. And especially here in Southern California, where I'm from, there's a particular smell that marks this time, one that screams first day of school. I can't describe it. Is it the morning dew on local plants mixed with fresh notebooks and sharpened pencils? I mean, just one whiff and I'm back in Mrs. Cohen's (ph) first grade classroom. I wanted to understand this response - why smell is so powerful. So I talked to someone who calls herself the smell lady. JUDE STEWART: There's some really, like, literary smells out there now. I have a couple of them that derive from a novel or something, and it's a combination of smells that really roll up to, like, a story. GUTIERREZ: That's Jude Stewart. STEWART: One that I like - it smells like grass but also the whiff of tennis balls, and it's called Soft Lawn. It relates to a novel about a tennis star. You know, when I wear this particular one, I love talking about tennis balls, 'cause why not? GUTIERREZ: Jude came out with a literal guidebook to smell called \"Revelations In Air. \" Jude and I talked about the science of smell, perfume trends and the many ways we underestimate how important it is to be able to smell, although Jude says thanks to COVID, that's starting to change. STEWART: I mean, I don't think it's an exaggeration to say that, you know, COVID really woke up a lot of people to the awareness of their sense of smell as being important, you know? There's this sense of dislocated unreality, like, that your world isn't really happening. Like, your child doesn't smell like your child anymore. Your wife doesn't smell like your wife. I mean, these are - if you put it that way, it's, like, horrible to think about. You know, we really don't want to be a brain in the jar, and I think that's the experience of losing smell, is that you don't feel like your body is in the world anymore. GUTIERREZ: Right. So as we've moved back out into the world, it seems like there's interest in fragrances that have historically been used in ritual - essential oils that smell like palo santo or frankincense, for instance. What does that say to you about the type of sensations and experiences we're craving now? STEWART: Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I like that you identified them as ritualistic. And in some ways, these smells kind of get back to the - really, the heart of the origins of perfumes and smell in a social context because a lot of incense was designed to kind of gather people around into a moment, feel a sense of community, where all - for the period of time that the incense burns, we're all smelling the same thing. The incense smoke is actually traveling up, and it's connecting us with something bigger than ourselves. And when - you know, when it's burned out, it's over. It's a very time-based kind of phenomenon. The origin of the word perfume actually does refer to this idea of, like, the fume and the smoke going up. So it kind of gets right back to that etymology, if you will. You know, and I think it speaks to a lot of things that we're feeling right now, is that sense of loneliness moving into connection, that sense of, what does all this mean? You know, and maybe I want to reconsider my life in a big-picture sense differently now that we can actually get back together with people and travel and do all the things. GUTIERREZ: Yeah. Another recent trend is a skin scent? This can smell like deep musk or - this new thing where the idea is fragrances, like, take your own body scent and enhance it to create something intimate and unique, which, I mean, the scent of skin - the smell of skin and bodies, is, like, intimate in itself, right? Why do you think we want to be able to smell skin or smell of skin now? STEWART: Well, I mean, I remember that when I hugged my friends for the first time right after COVID, it was like - it felt so good to hug them again, not just physically. But I realized I had missed their smell. I had missed being in their presence. It doesn't always have to be sexy or romantic to smell someone else. I'm personally a really big fan of those perfumes because it's like, they just slightly edit reality. You know, they make you smell like you but a little bit better. And there's something also kind of very witty about that, that it's so subtle. You're not even sure the person's wearing perfume. I think we want to feel realness. And smell that derives from natural sources just really punches up our sense of physicality and presence - bodily presence, you know? And that means something to us now. GUTIERREZ: Right. I mean, also makes me think of, like, what is the story that our personal smells tell about us? STEWART: You can think of your sense of smell - your body smell as sort of happening at three layers. So this baseline layer was just constant radiating out into the air, nothing to do with what you're applying to your skin. That's your immune system and your state of health being reflected. You know, there are various diseases you might get that would fluctuate that smell that's coming off your body. So that's one layer. There's a middle layer that's, like, acculturated type of smell - so what kind of diet you have and what kind of work you do, if you eat a lot of chili or you eat a lot of curry or what have you. And then at the top layer is this, like, did we take a shower today? What kind of, you know, products are we wearing? But also at this level of, like, just fluctuating emotions - like, you can actually smell other people's emotions. They have studied fear, disgust, happiness. These are all identifiable through our sense of smell. So, you know, really, it's amazing how much information about you personally at any given moment is being given off by your body smell. GUTIERREZ: Studies have confirmed that we have recognizable smells from birth. Why is that? STEWART: Oh, well, I think it goes back to this question of our immune system and the uniqueness of what's being expressed there. But it also has to do with, you know, the mother - mother-child bond. So there is one very small study that just knocked my socks off where mothers had been given an extremely limited amount of time with their newborns. This is right after birth - 10 minutes up to an hour maximum. You know, they were given a series of little clothing that had smelled like various babies, and they were asked to identify their own child. And some extraordinary percentage - like, over 90% of the parents, could identify the smell. . . GUTIERREZ: Wow. STEWART: . . . With almost no exposure to their child. There was another study that was mothers and fathers, and that - sort of same idea, where they took amniotic fluid and asked the parents to identify which one belonged to their child. And the fathers actually blew it out of the water with that one. And they - almost all of them could recognize the smell. So I think it has to do with this bonding and, you know, this intense connection that we have with this little person. GUTIERREZ: Is there a smell that has strong emotional resonance for you? Like, you feel it. You just - I can't put words to that. I feel this, though. STEWART: You know, I have a chapter in the book on the smell of beer, which I wouldn't have otherwise said was - yeah, I wouldn't have said that was, like, particularly emotive for me. GUTIERREZ: Beer has so many different smells at different stages - when it's fresh, when it's been sitting there. STEWART: Yeah, yeah. This is - I wouldn't have said that until I actually sat down and really - I got this beer. And my plan was to smell the beer. And I was talking to a beer master - brew master. And he was going to tell me what the different smells of the beer could tell me about the process of brewing and, like, how this beer arrived to be what it is. So I had this kind of very rational plan about me smelling beer. And what I found is that it was really hard to get back on that track 'cause it just reminded me of hanging out in beer gardens in Berlin, which is a place I love and have spent a lot of time. And I was doing it at the time, you know, during COVID, where nobody could travel. And it was just very sad-making, actually. And I had a hard time really lifting myself out of that. GUTIERREZ: Scent can unlock all these memories and these - and obviously, with memories, emotions. Why do we have such powerful emotions tied to smell? STEWART: Every time you encounter a new smell, on some level, you are deciding, is this a threat or is it an opportunity? So you're making very swift judgments. And, you know, if you get sick of a particular smell, you're never going to want to eat that again. You will never be convinced, however delicious, to eat that thing again. So emotion is bound up in it. Our other senses - they generally travel through a part of the brain that's called the thalamus, which is part of our new brain. Smell goes right up your nose, and then it interacts with your brain at the level of olfactory bulbs. And those are very closely tied in with the amygdala and hippocampus. So part of the reason why we can't put words or it's difficult to put words to smells is because the language centers of the brain are not part of this process. But the emotion centers and the memory centers are very closely tied with smells. It's almost upsetting how vivid and instant it is. It's like teleportation. GUTIERREZ: Is there anything interesting to you right now about smell science or smell technology? Like, how are new developments different or better than, say, Smell-O-Vision of years past? STEWART: Oh, Smell-O-Vision. Yes. Well, see, I just wrote an article arguing for smells in virtual reality. So that was a fun thing to research. You know, smells can't really be transmitted on the internet. Basically, you have to smell an actual smelly thing. It has to be in front of your nose for you to, like, experience that. So you're inherently limited in how many smells you're going to have, if they're going to be part of, like, a VR headset, for example. That said, there's some interesting kind of hacks that you can do to either expand on the possible smells or just make the smells more immersive and really deepen in an experience. I talked to a researcher named Jess Brooks (ph) at the University of Chicago, and they were telling me about some work that they'd done around the trigeminal nerve. It's a bunch of nerves that we have on our face. This nerve senses temperature, as well as smell. So when you smell eucalyptus and it seems kind of cold, that's your trigeminal nerve sort of reacting to the temperature quality of the smell. So you can use that and manipulate that in different settings to - you know, if you're in a snowy landscape in the VR situation, if you smell a little whiff of peppermint or eucalyptus, it will make you feel colder. So it's smell on the one hand. But on the other hand, it's providing a deeper dimensionality for the whole experience - kind of a fun little hack, you know? So that one I enjoyed quite a lot. GUTIERREZ: Yeah. I think of, like, Dr. Bronner's peppermint. You got to be careful with that one. . . STEWART: Yeah. GUTIERREZ: . . . Because it feel - you feel that, like, prickling kind of, like, coolness of that one. Yeah, you don't want to use it in all situations. STEWART: It's true. GUTIERREZ: So when it comes to fragrances especially, we talk about natural and synthetic smells. This is something of special interest to me. I love all kinds of scents, but I'm very sensitive to synthetic fragrance. Like, I get headaches. I don't feel well. Especially, a lot of times, it'll just be really overbearing to me. STEWART: Yeah. I mean, it's real. There's a condition called hyperosmia, which is this extreme sensitivity to smell. And it - a lot of people experience it in - during pregnancy, but, you know, for other people, it's more of a enduring thing. And, you know, it can produce migraines and has lots of real effects for people. GUTIERREZ: I always have to check labels for words - the words fragrance or perfume, so I keep looking for something without them. How do we actually define those terms, natural and synthetic? STEWART: Oh, that's a great question. So if you create a jasmine, you know, molecule in the lab and you get one from an actual flower, the molecules are going to be identical. They're going to be exactly the same. The question is, though, the molecules from the flower - there will be many different molecules. And did you get enough of the representative molecules to truly represent the fragrance of the flower? And just to make that more complex, flowers release smells all day long, depending on what kind of, like, bees they're trying to attract or insects. So, you know, if you're really very nuanced, as perfumers often are, they might, like, know that the smell in the morning is different from the afternoon or evening. There's many different molecules. So you might be sensing, more than anything, the, like - the incompleteness of this approximation in the lab. But you know what's interesting is that there are actually lab-invented molecules that have never existed that we can smell. I found that to be so amazing. You can make them in the lab, and you can smell them with your nose. So. . . GUTIERREZ: So something that doesn't exist in nature already. STEWART: Yeah. Yeah, I have a perfume that's called Molecule Five, and it's entirely, like, a lab-invented, you know, synthetic molecule. GUTIERREZ: I mean, I hope that since you have it - it's a perfume you have, like, does it smell good? Like, what does it smell like? Is there anything that you can compare it to? STEWART: (Laughter) Oh, OK. It smells like, I would say, like, a kind of a dead lily shading into smoke. It's sort of this very overblown, like, flowery smell. And I like that. . . GUTIERREZ: So specific. STEWART: I know. I like how weird it is. People like, what is that? You know, and we're like, this is one molecule that did not exist until 1976 or what have you - forget the exact year. But, you know, it - your mind kind of fills in some reference of what it must be, and I find that kind of cool. GUTIERREZ: But it also makes me think of - there's, like, this issue here, especially in Southern California, where there are people poaching white sage in the wild. There's this great LA Times article that really goes into depth about it. Poachers are endangering the plant so they can sell bundles for smudging online, on social media, whatnot. And so now you're kind of endangering something that is not only native to the land, but the native peoples - like Chumash and Tongva peoples have used it for different things. It makes me think that the pursuit of what is, quote-unquote, \"natural\" can actually be damaging sometimes. That - in some ways, it, like, makes the case for, like, having these be synthetic or synthesized scents. STEWART: I love that example, because it exactly gets at the complexity of, like, the issues at play. That - I mean, there are quite a few perfume ingredients that have been, you know, hunted almost to extinction. Like, you mentioned musk earlier. Well, musk used to come from the deer, and they would - you know, the deers became very endangered. There are many, many other things that come into play when you require every scent to come from the earth. It becomes very taxing on resources. So it's - synthetics do help with that problem. GUTIERREZ: Yeah. Do you find yourself letting your nose lead you through the world? STEWART: Oh, big time. Yes, yes. I think that smelling is kind of mindfulness turned inside out. You know, when you think about meditating, like, you're focused on your breath and you're focusing inward. And maybe you're saying a mantra or what have you. But when you smell, you're doing the same thing, but you're focusing on the world and it's like, your body in this particular place at this time. Smells don't last forever. They go away, you know, with the air movement. So it's like - it really pins you to a moment. And so I - yeah. I, like, can't ever unthink that thought, and I don't want to. GUTIERREZ: Well, Jude, thank you so much. I just really appreciate a really, like, fascinating look into the world of smell - smell into the world of smell and scent. But I really appreciate talking to you today. STEWART: Oh, this was such a pleasure. Thank you so much, Andrea. GUTIERREZ: Thanks again to Jude Stewart, author of \"Revelations In Air: A Guidebook To Smell. \"(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)HU: This episode of IT'S BEEN A MINUTE was produced by Barton Girdwood, Andrea Gutierrez, Liam McBain, Janet Woojeong Lee and Jessica Mendoza. GUTIERREZ: Our supervising editor is Jessica Placzek. Our executive producer is Veralyn Williams. Our VP of programming is Yolanda Sangweni, and our big boss is NPR's senior VP of programming, Anya Grundmann. HU: Listeners, take good care of yourselves, and thank you for listening. I'm Elise Hu. GUTIERREZ: And I'm Andrea Gutierrez. Talk soon. CYNTHIA: Hello. I'm Andrea's sister Cynthia (ph). On today's show, we're going to be real about this summer's hottest new social media app - also, why smell is so powerful. All right. Let's start the show. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ANDREA GUTIERREZ, HOST:   Hello, hello. You're listening to IT'S BEEN A MINUTE from NPR. I'm Andrea Gutierrez. ELISE HU, HOST:   And I'm Elise Hu. We are your guest hosts this week. GUTIERREZ: And now, it's time to be real. HU: Andrea, I always think you're being real. GUTIERREZ: Aw, thank you. I think you're being real, too. HU: So real. GUTIERREZ: We're talking about the app. Maybe you've heard of it, maybe you haven't. Either way, it's getting all kinds of attention this summer, and it's called BeReal. HU: The name kind of says it all, right? The promise is authenticity. GUTIERREZ: Elise, I'm going to be honest. I've been hearing about BeReal all summer, but I haven't actually downloaded it yet. HU: OK. It's worth a shot. So how about you go do that, and I'll take it from here? GUTIERREZ: All right. See you later. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) HU: So for those of you who haven't heard of it, let me break it down. The app sends a push notification, an alert, to all of its users at the exact same time. And then we users have about 2 minutes to post a photo of whatever it is we're doing, wherever we are at that moment. No thrills, frills or makeup if you're not already wearing it because it's a photo of you and what you're looking at. HALEY NAHMAN: It gets your front camera and your back camera. HU: That's Hailey Nahman. She's a podcaster and writer of the popular newsletter on modern life called Maybe Baby. NAHMAN: And the idea, the sales pitch, is kind of you understand what your friends are up to in a more kind of grounded in the moment, unplanned way. RYAN BRODERICK: I always compare it to Wordle. HU: And that's Ryan Broderick. He's also a podcaster who writes the newsletter Garbage Day on the latest trends of online life. BRODERICK: That's sort of my comparison, where it's like this thing you do once a day and then you forget about it. I have never successfully hit the push alert at the right time. I don't know why. I just - I miss it every single time. NAHMAN: (Laughter). HU: So BeReal, it's another social media app that promises to connect us. It's a game. It's all of the above. But what does its popularity say about what we want from social media now? And as we've become increasingly disillusioned - my hand's up - with the promise of social media, how authentic can we really be online? Well, Haley, Ryan and I are going to get into those questions. But first, out of the three of us, who among us is on BeReal and who isn't? NAHMAN: I'm not. BRODERICK: I tried, and I very quickly lost interest. (LAUGHTER) HU: Ryan, what have you taken a picture of? Like, what stands out to you in terms of what you've done on BeReal? BRODERICK: Well, I was on vacation in Italy, so I was very interested in bragging. . . HU: Oh, not fair. BRODERICK: . . . About that. And then I stopped using it entirely when I went back to my normal life (laughter). HU: I have taken a photo of my laptop screen the last three days, I think. So you're welcome for that content, my four followers. NAHMAN: It's very ethical of you, Elise. HU: (Laughter). NAHMAN: And if you're late, it says that you did not post in the allotted time. BRODERICK: Yes. It shames you. NAHMAN: Yeah. You're shamed. (LAUGHTER) HU: So that is to say that it's important for the app designers - or it's an idea baked into the app that they decide when you take an image. The user doesn't decide. BRODERICK: Right. NAHMAN: Yes. HU: And what do you think the point of that is? BRODERICK: My gut is that it's trying to subvert influencers - you know, these people who on TikTok and Instagram will take, like, extremely elaborate, aspirational, like, you know, very prim and proper photos. They don't want you to do that. They want you to just take a photo on the fly and add it to the feed. NAHMAN: Right. No pretenses, no planning, no deciding when the right moment is in your life to highlight - I think that's the sales pitch at least. BRODERICK: Yeah. It's very hard to pose with my Nescafe coffee, which is. . . HU: (Laughter). BRODERICK: . . . My sponsor this month, when I only have 2 minutes to plan. HU: Just to be clear, Ryan is not sponsored by Nescafe. NAHMAN: (Laughter). HU: So what's y'all's take on it? Is it a healthier approach? NAHMAN: I don't doubt at all that it's entertaining and maybe refreshing in certain ways as a kind of opposing approach to Instagram, where everything's starting to feel, like, way too edited and filtered. HU: Yeah. NAHMAN: Where my, like, cynicism comes in, I guess, is basically in the marketing. The idea - even in the name BeReal, this idea that we're supposed to immediately buy into that being prompted by your phone to take a photo is necessarily going to reveal some sort of truth or reality about your life. HU: Right. NAHMAN: I think oftentimes, like, a lot of social platforms have these really lofty kind of PR-spun missions about how they're going to connect people and, like, help you share your life. And as we've seen with most other platforms, that doesn't really end up being the product. It's not really what they're selling, and it's not what's being sold. So I just have some cynicism about BeReal's entire premise. HU: Let's dig in on that, right? Let's dig in on the premise of BeReal. Do we expect the social internet as something that helps us reveal the truth? - because a lot of tweets on this have said things like, I would never go on BeReal; the internet is for being fake. Right? Like, it is a norm that the internet is fake. And so is BeReal kind of a solution in search of a problem or is it nostalgic? Is it going back or trying to go back to a kind of internet that never really existed? BRODERICK: Well, I do think it's, like, very interesting. I hadn't thought about this until I was doing interviews for a piece on BeReal and, like, a young woman I was talking to mentioned this - where, yes, BeReal is \"authentic,\" quote-unquote, but it can be very toxic when people are glamorous on it. It's almost worse. The person I was talking to sort of described it as this feeling of, like, discovering your friends are actually much wealthier than you or more interesting. . . HU: Or less boring, yeah. BRODERICK: . . . Or more - yeah, less boring. And it is this interesting way of - yeah, you're flipping the idea of, like, everyone's a celebrity on Instagram, and Instagram is your personal reality show, but then it's giving you this window into other people's lives that is almost sometimes more uncomfortable because you think, like, oh, like, I look like a slob right now. But how do you not look like a slob? NAHMAN: I asked my subscribers recently who use BeReal how they felt about the app experience, and a lot of people said that they've noticed the competitiveness starting to sneak into it, like, so quickly. They said that they're scrambling to take an aesthetic photo in 2 minutes, like, they have - they're already subverting the entire premise, and, like, as their circles are getting wider on BeReal, it's no longer kind of the fun, intimate thing it started as. And it's funny that so quickly with the app's popularity - the rise in popularity - it's kind of caving to all the pitfalls of the other apps that it was supposedly. . . HU: Yeah, the same tendencies, right? NAHMAN: Right. HU: BeReal, which is supposed to have no aesthetic - like, the whole point is for it to just not be gamified somehow is already being gamified. Is that what you're saying? NAHMAN: Yeah, exactly. I mean, even if nobody figured out how to gamify it, it would still be sort of random, right? It's coming at a random time. It might catch you at a boring moment or a more interesting moment. You have no control over that. People - I got some comments of people saying that they were really bummed that the push notification would come when they were doing something boring, when, like, they had just been outside reading by a pool and things like that, where it's, like - at a certain point, you're, like, becoming even more neurotic. Like, you're chained to your phone in this new way. HU: Yeah, because the app could signal us at any moment. It just makes us more lab rats, right? Like - or it could - a cynical take would be that - right? - that because we know that BeReal could ping us at any moment, then shouldn't I spend more time outside by the pool making my life look great? BRODERICK: Yeah. I do think it kind of adds this, like, weird, metacontextual idea of our lives. But I do - I don't know - I always sort of question whenever, like, young people use the internet - part of me always just, like, remembers when I was a young person using the internet. . . NAHMAN: Those young people. Yeah. BRODERICK: Yeah. And, like, I didn't take any of it seriously. So, like, whenever I read, sort of like - I never want to be the older person being like, teenagers are having their minds melted by the internet. It's, like, I assume the average BeReal user has, like, 15 people they follow. And, like, once classes start in college again, like, they're just not going to touch it. Like, it's just, like, a summer app that, like, will disappear. NAHMAN: I think so, too. BRODERICK: Yeah. That's my gut. NAHMAN: It's a blip. I don't know if you saw this in the news, but I think Facebook just introduced something called a candid challenge. HU: Oh. BRODERICK: It's over, baby. It's already done, yeah. NAHMAN: It's - yeah, that's the death knell. Instagram always just - this is, like, the classic move, but. . . HU: Cannibalizes it, yeah. NAHMAN: Yeah, yeah. BRODERICK: I do want to push just a little and say, like, I do think there's a couple key trends that, like, BeReal has, like, brought to light that won't go away even if BeReal dies. HU: Yeah, let's broaden it out. BRODERICK: Yeah, so, like, BeReal - I think the biggest thing is it's not Instagram, which is where your parents are now. So, like, that's really very - that's going to be increasingly important in the same way that, you know, I don't use Facebook anymore. So, like, the new generation - they're not going to touch Meta products. I also think that, like, the new generation of internet users - if you look at, like, the trends and how they're using the internet, they typically don't love public feeds. And if they do use public feeds, they don't use their real names, or, like, they have, like, nine different accounts for, you know, every K-pop band they like or something, right? Like they're using multiple identities to interact. And I also think that, like, there's just a massive generational shift about, you know, what you could call, like, life data - this idea that you have an Instagram grid with your vacation photos, and they're going to live there forever. They don't seem interested in that stuff. And you can see this in, like, their love of Twitch or their love of Discord or their love of TikTok, which is not really a traditional social network in the same way that, like, Facebook is asking you to update your bio, right? So I think all of those things are here to stay. And BeReal kind of hit this, like, perfect moment where it was summertime. There's stuff to do. There's not a lot going on. And it offered enough of those things that it was pretty sticky. HU: Yeah. Some of the aspects that you talk about - Ryan, especially - just about returning to a more intimate internet, a more anonymized internet, where you use handles instead of your actual name and identity, and you don't have a brand because you're hidden. It actually harkens to the very beginnings of the internet - right? - like AIM and IRC, where you never used your real name. So it's kind of like everything old is new again. NAHMAN: Life is a circle. BRODERICK: Right, yeah. It always just - it's the 15-year rule, right? But I do think that, like, BeReal does tap into this idea of, like, the internet is something you experience with, like, the closest 20 people in your life, which is very, like - it goes very against the millennial idea of, like - I'm verified on Twitter, and here's my LinkedIn. It's, like, this different idea, where you're not putting yourself out into public spaces online. You might be anonymous when you are, but you're spending a lot more time in, you know, Snapchat, sharing TikToks on iMessage, or if you're outside of America, WhatsApp. But, like, I think those sort of dark social, as it's called, like, areas seem to be where more activity's happening, which makes me think that, like, BeReal, because it uses your contact list when you start it - like, maybe that's why it blew up, is because all of a sudden, like, the 30 closest people in your phone book are just there. And you can just port that over. NAHMAN: I think I can see what you mean, Ryan, about, like, the more intimate internet experience being interesting. I think the problem with BeReal, of course, is that it's not really integrating with our lives the way that I think some of those other intimate spaces - like, you know, like, WhatsApp or Discord or even just, like, iMessage, where I spend most of my time on my phone - they feel like they really integrate with my relationships. They feel supplemental. They can never replace it, but they're just, like, this little funny side project, whereas BeReal feels like it's kind of forcing itself into your life in a way that doesn't feel sustainable. BRODERICK: Yeah, I agree. HU: So the broad question is, can social media meaningfully help humans connect, as it promises? BRODERICK: I think absolutely. I am optimistic. I think it is good. And I think the major issue that we have right now is that there's, like, five companies. They run the internet. And the way that we feel using the internet would be the same way we felt if, you know, we only had a Walmart to go to in our town. It would be the same way we felt if instead of public parks, we only had the option between being alone or going to Coachella, right? Like, there's no version of the internet that makes good business sense at the moment that emphasizes the local, emphasizes the regional, emphasizes the personal because it's run by monopolies that want to take away our ability to leave their walled gardens. They want to monopolize our time, our attention, our emotions, our data. But there's - if you, like, were to close your eyes and think nostalgically about the best times you've had online, chances are you were in some kind of digital environment that had less than 100 people in it. I'm going to guess. It's just human nature. We don't want to be forced to, like, fight each other in a Hunger Games all day, you know? It's just not fun. And so I am optimistic, though, that, you know - and I kind of pin it on the pandemic, where we all had group chats to stay in touch with each other. We. . . HU: Yeah, that's true - the pandemic group chats. BRODERICK: Yeah, we worked on Zoom and, like, drank on Zoom and did all those other things. Like, we had these local networks we built. And they didn't go away like I thought they would. I sort of thought, like, OK, pandemic's, quote-unquote, \"over. \" Time to go back to the way things were. We're not. So now we've kind of integrated ourselves into the internet in a way that was bound to happen, but I think it just sped up. And right now we're carving out different ways of not feeling insane online, because I think we can all kind of agree that being online is fun, and it matters, and it drives culture, and it makes things interesting. But the big thing we have to fix is the fact that, like, there are five companies, most of which are owned by, like, weird men, dictating how we use the internet. And, like, what if that wasn't true? What if it was more local? What if it was more flexible? What if it was more natural? NAHMAN: I think we keep turning to tech to, like - we've often seen it as, like, sort of this parallel to the physical world. Like, we could have representations of all these things on the internet, right? Like, magazines became websites. Clubhouses or clubs became, like, chat rooms. Like, we really were trying to create these digital analogues for everything. And what we've come to with social media and social platforms is just this attempt to commodify, like, human connection. And we keep trying to do it in interesting and new ways and, you know, in higher fidelity ways with, like, Meta. And I think what we're failing to see is that there is basically a flaw in this entire project. These digital landscapes - they're too literal and objective. They're too two-dimensional to really capture humanity. And they keep sort of spiraling us down a path that's - doesn't really feel like it's building towards anything meaningful, at least to me. Your vision, Ryan, of the internet being, like, more hyperlocal does appeal to me, but I still think that - I still wish, I guess, that we had more minds who were looking to create or solve for, like, social problems offline or at least using technology more as a sort of tool than a kind of end environment, if that makes sense. HU: Yeah, I hear you there. In the meantime, we will be watching for the demise or the acquisition of BeReal. BRODERICK: Yeah. HU: Thank you so much, Haley and Ryan. Would y'all be down to stick around and play a game with me? BRODERICK: Absolutely. NAHMAN: I'm in. HU: All right. You sound so excited (laughter). Coming up, who said that? (SOUNDBITE OF FLEVANS' \"FLICKER\") HU: All right, and we are back to play a game called, Who Said That? NAHMAN: I'm nervous. HU: Here's how it works. I will share a quote with you that you might have heard in the news this week, and you can guess either who said that or what it's about. There's no buzzers. You just yell out the answer. BRODERICK: OK. HU: As usual, you win nothing. Zero prizes - just bragging rights. NAHMAN: All right. BRODERICK: Excellent, perfect. NAHMAN: I'm ready. HU: OK, here's the first quote. Fill in the blank - for he knew the cold truth. The only thing that could tear down blank was itself. BRODERICK: Oh. NAHMAN: No. BRODERICK: \"House Of The Dragon. \" (SOUNDBITE OF VICTORY TUNE) NAHMAN: Oh. HU: That is a quote from the opening scene. NAHMAN: Wow. BRODERICK: Yes, I - yes. NAHMAN: I didn't watch. BRODERICK: It's good. I was skeptical going in, but I liked it. HU: In \"House Of The Dragon\" - Ryan, tell everyone who doesn't know what \"House Of The Dragon\" is. BRODERICK: It is the new \"Game Of Thrones\" prequel spinoff-y (ph) thing on HBO. NAHMAN: Very divisive on Twitter, I'm seeing. BRODERICK: Yes, yes. HU: Super divisive - Twitter, one of the places where Haley still kind of hangs out in social media. NAHMAN: Oh, I still hang around. I'm not that noble. HU: So the show premiered last Sunday, and the first episode drew 9. 99 million viewers, which is the biggest series premiere ever for HBO. And the quote I just read from comes from Princess - how do we say her first name? BRODERICK: Rhaneera (ph)? Rhanayra (ph)? HU: Yes. BRODERICK: Something like that? It's all, like, Ragar (ph) and Arnar (ph) and Aemond - I can't keep them all straight, and I've read the books. I can't keep them all straight. HU: Sounds right. Sounds right. All right - one point for Ryan. So this means that, Haley, you still have - you have - you still have a chance of coming from behind and win this. NAHMAN: All right, all right. HU: . . . 'Cause it's three quotes. NAHMAN: I'm stretching. HU: OK, next quote - sometimes people say you've only publicly been with women, and I don't think I've publicly been with anyone. If someone takes. . . NAHMAN: Harry Styles. (SOUNDBITE OF VICTORY TUNE) NAHMAN: I interrupted with my buzzer. HU: I needed to be doing this in a British accent, really, 'cause that could have made it easier. But clearly, it didn't need to be any easier for you. This clue was so easy. All right, sometimes people say you've only publicly been with women, and I don't think I've publicly been with anyone. If someone takes a picture of you with someone, it doesn't mean you're choosing to have a public relationship or something. All right, Haley, context please. NAHMAN: Yes, this is Harry Styles as a response to being accused of queerbaiting by playing with gender and how he dresses and presenting as straight in paparazzi photos. HU: Lots of the LGBTQI community have been debating whether his statements fall into that category. What are your thoughts? Do you think he's queerbaiting? NAHMAN: I don't know. I have no idea. And I don't know how useful it is to debate about it - not here on this podcast. I'm not, like, accusing you. I'm just - I just wonder if it's the time best spent - like, if it leads towards liberation for anyone. I'm not sure. HU: Cool. Oh, well, you know what? The bigger point here is that you two are now tied up. NAHMAN: Whew. HU: All right, 1-1 - for the win here or the tie - we can end in a draw. We're going to play you a sound. This is very special. This is unique on IT'S BEEN A MINUTE. We're going to play you a sound, and you're going to guess where this sound is coming from. Are you all ready? BRODERICK: Yeah. Let's do it. (SOUNDBITE OF A BLACK HOLE) BRODERICK: Oh, buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz. . . NAHMAN: I know what this is. BRODERICK: . . . Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz. NAHMAN: I know too. I was waiting until the end. HU: Somebody just yell it out, just yell it out. NAHMAN: Space. BRODERICK: It's a NASA video of a galaxy. It's a gaseous galaxy making noise, yeah. (SOUNDBITE OF A BLACK HOLE) NAHMAN: The sound of space. BRODERICK: Yeah. HU: I'm giving it both - I'm giving it to both of you. But Haley should get the point for how succinct her answer was 'cause Haley just goes space. BRODERICK: It's space, yeah. HU: And then Ryan's, like, it's sourced from NASA. It's a gaseous (laughter). . . BRODERICK: I don't - yeah, I - all I remember is that this is what gas sounds like in space if there's too much of it, which I thought was funny. HU: You both got it. I'm giving you a half point each to tie it up. That was awesome. NAHMAN: I'm happy - 1 1/2? HU: Yeah, so 1 1/2 each. NAHMAN: Good - we're good competition. BRODERICK: Yeah, absolutely. HU: Yeah, that was the sound of a black hole that NASA released this week. I didn't know black holes even had sounds because I thought, like, the nature of the black hole was that kind of - it was anti-matter. NAHMAN: I saw a tweet of someone saying, oh, that's cool. It just sounds like a million souls trapped in hell. HU: (Laughter). NAHMAN: It's really promising. HU: Haley, we would have accepted that as the answer too - a million souls trapped in hell. NAHMAN: It's actually a good way to end the episode on BeReal. BRODERICK: Yeah, that's true. That is very true. HU: We have come full circle once again. We have come full black hole. All right, that was awesome. You tied. Both of you tied. Thanks again to worthy competitors Haley Nahman and Ryan Broderick. NAHMAN: Thank you so much. It's so nice to meet you both. BRODERICK: Thank you. Yeah. Woo. HU: Woo. Coming up, COVID has made us more aware of the power of smell, but it's still underappreciated. My co-host, Andrea Gutierrez, talks to someone who says it's past time for smell to get its cultural moment. (SOUNDBITE OF FLEVANS' \"FLICKER\") HU: You're listening to IT'S BEEN A MINUTE from NPR. I'm Elise Hu. GUTIERREZ: And I'm Andrea Gutierrez. Elise, I don't know about you, but this time of year is always oddly emotional for me. HU: Why is that? GUTIERREZ: Well, fall is right around the corner. School is starting. And especially here in Southern California, where I'm from, there's a particular smell that marks this time, one that screams first day of school. I can't describe it. Is it the morning dew on local plants mixed with fresh notebooks and sharpened pencils? I mean, just one whiff and I'm back in Mrs. Cohen's (ph) first grade classroom. I wanted to understand this response - why smell is so powerful. So I talked to someone who calls herself the smell lady. JUDE STEWART: There's some really, like, literary smells out there now. I have a couple of them that derive from a novel or something, and it's a combination of smells that really roll up to, like, a story. GUTIERREZ: That's Jude Stewart. STEWART: One that I like - it smells like grass but also the whiff of tennis balls, and it's called Soft Lawn. It relates to a novel about a tennis star. You know, when I wear this particular one, I love talking about tennis balls, 'cause why not? GUTIERREZ: Jude came out with a literal guidebook to smell called \"Revelations In Air. \" Jude and I talked about the science of smell, perfume trends and the many ways we underestimate how important it is to be able to smell, although Jude says thanks to COVID, that's starting to change. STEWART: I mean, I don't think it's an exaggeration to say that, you know, COVID really woke up a lot of people to the awareness of their sense of smell as being important, you know? There's this sense of dislocated unreality, like, that your world isn't really happening. Like, your child doesn't smell like your child anymore. Your wife doesn't smell like your wife. I mean, these are - if you put it that way, it's, like, horrible to think about. You know, we really don't want to be a brain in the jar, and I think that's the experience of losing smell, is that you don't feel like your body is in the world anymore. GUTIERREZ: Right. So as we've moved back out into the world, it seems like there's interest in fragrances that have historically been used in ritual - essential oils that smell like palo santo or frankincense, for instance. What does that say to you about the type of sensations and experiences we're craving now? STEWART: Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I like that you identified them as ritualistic. And in some ways, these smells kind of get back to the - really, the heart of the origins of perfumes and smell in a social context because a lot of incense was designed to kind of gather people around into a moment, feel a sense of community, where all - for the period of time that the incense burns, we're all smelling the same thing. The incense smoke is actually traveling up, and it's connecting us with something bigger than ourselves. And when - you know, when it's burned out, it's over. It's a very time-based kind of phenomenon. The origin of the word perfume actually does refer to this idea of, like, the fume and the smoke going up. So it kind of gets right back to that etymology, if you will. You know, and I think it speaks to a lot of things that we're feeling right now, is that sense of loneliness moving into connection, that sense of, what does all this mean? You know, and maybe I want to reconsider my life in a big-picture sense differently now that we can actually get back together with people and travel and do all the things. GUTIERREZ: Yeah. Another recent trend is a skin scent? This can smell like deep musk or - this new thing where the idea is fragrances, like, take your own body scent and enhance it to create something intimate and unique, which, I mean, the scent of skin - the smell of skin and bodies, is, like, intimate in itself, right? Why do you think we want to be able to smell skin or smell of skin now? STEWART: Well, I mean, I remember that when I hugged my friends for the first time right after COVID, it was like - it felt so good to hug them again, not just physically. But I realized I had missed their smell. I had missed being in their presence. It doesn't always have to be sexy or romantic to smell someone else. I'm personally a really big fan of those perfumes because it's like, they just slightly edit reality. You know, they make you smell like you but a little bit better. And there's something also kind of very witty about that, that it's so subtle. You're not even sure the person's wearing perfume. I think we want to feel realness. And smell that derives from natural sources just really punches up our sense of physicality and presence - bodily presence, you know? And that means something to us now. GUTIERREZ: Right. I mean, also makes me think of, like, what is the story that our personal smells tell about us? STEWART: You can think of your sense of smell - your body smell as sort of happening at three layers. So this baseline layer was just constant radiating out into the air, nothing to do with what you're applying to your skin. That's your immune system and your state of health being reflected. You know, there are various diseases you might get that would fluctuate that smell that's coming off your body. So that's one layer. There's a middle layer that's, like, acculturated type of smell - so what kind of diet you have and what kind of work you do, if you eat a lot of chili or you eat a lot of curry or what have you. And then at the top layer is this, like, did we take a shower today? What kind of, you know, products are we wearing? But also at this level of, like, just fluctuating emotions - like, you can actually smell other people's emotions. They have studied fear, disgust, happiness. These are all identifiable through our sense of smell. So, you know, really, it's amazing how much information about you personally at any given moment is being given off by your body smell. GUTIERREZ: Studies have confirmed that we have recognizable smells from birth. Why is that? STEWART: Oh, well, I think it goes back to this question of our immune system and the uniqueness of what's being expressed there. But it also has to do with, you know, the mother - mother-child bond. So there is one very small study that just knocked my socks off where mothers had been given an extremely limited amount of time with their newborns. This is right after birth - 10 minutes up to an hour maximum. You know, they were given a series of little clothing that had smelled like various babies, and they were asked to identify their own child. And some extraordinary percentage - like, over 90% of the parents, could identify the smell. . . GUTIERREZ: Wow. STEWART: . . . With almost no exposure to their child. There was another study that was mothers and fathers, and that - sort of same idea, where they took amniotic fluid and asked the parents to identify which one belonged to their child. And the fathers actually blew it out of the water with that one. And they - almost all of them could recognize the smell. So I think it has to do with this bonding and, you know, this intense connection that we have with this little person. GUTIERREZ: Is there a smell that has strong emotional resonance for you? Like, you feel it. You just - I can't put words to that. I feel this, though. STEWART: You know, I have a chapter in the book on the smell of beer, which I wouldn't have otherwise said was - yeah, I wouldn't have said that was, like, particularly emotive for me. GUTIERREZ: Beer has so many different smells at different stages - when it's fresh, when it's been sitting there. STEWART: Yeah, yeah. This is - I wouldn't have said that until I actually sat down and really - I got this beer. And my plan was to smell the beer. And I was talking to a beer master - brew master. And he was going to tell me what the different smells of the beer could tell me about the process of brewing and, like, how this beer arrived to be what it is. So I had this kind of very rational plan about me smelling beer. And what I found is that it was really hard to get back on that track 'cause it just reminded me of hanging out in beer gardens in Berlin, which is a place I love and have spent a lot of time. And I was doing it at the time, you know, during COVID, where nobody could travel. And it was just very sad-making, actually. And I had a hard time really lifting myself out of that. GUTIERREZ: Scent can unlock all these memories and these - and obviously, with memories, emotions. Why do we have such powerful emotions tied to smell? STEWART: Every time you encounter a new smell, on some level, you are deciding, is this a threat or is it an opportunity? So you're making very swift judgments. And, you know, if you get sick of a particular smell, you're never going to want to eat that again. You will never be convinced, however delicious, to eat that thing again. So emotion is bound up in it. Our other senses - they generally travel through a part of the brain that's called the thalamus, which is part of our new brain. Smell goes right up your nose, and then it interacts with your brain at the level of olfactory bulbs. And those are very closely tied in with the amygdala and hippocampus. So part of the reason why we can't put words or it's difficult to put words to smells is because the language centers of the brain are not part of this process. But the emotion centers and the memory centers are very closely tied with smells. It's almost upsetting how vivid and instant it is. It's like teleportation. GUTIERREZ: Is there anything interesting to you right now about smell science or smell technology? Like, how are new developments different or better than, say, Smell-O-Vision of years past? STEWART: Oh, Smell-O-Vision. Yes. Well, see, I just wrote an article arguing for smells in virtual reality. So that was a fun thing to research. You know, smells can't really be transmitted on the internet. Basically, you have to smell an actual smelly thing. It has to be in front of your nose for you to, like, experience that. So you're inherently limited in how many smells you're going to have, if they're going to be part of, like, a VR headset, for example. That said, there's some interesting kind of hacks that you can do to either expand on the possible smells or just make the smells more immersive and really deepen in an experience. I talked to a researcher named Jess Brooks (ph) at the University of Chicago, and they were telling me about some work that they'd done around the trigeminal nerve. It's a bunch of nerves that we have on our face. This nerve senses temperature, as well as smell. So when you smell eucalyptus and it seems kind of cold, that's your trigeminal nerve sort of reacting to the temperature quality of the smell. So you can use that and manipulate that in different settings to - you know, if you're in a snowy landscape in the VR situation, if you smell a little whiff of peppermint or eucalyptus, it will make you feel colder. So it's smell on the one hand. But on the other hand, it's providing a deeper dimensionality for the whole experience - kind of a fun little hack, you know? So that one I enjoyed quite a lot. GUTIERREZ: Yeah. I think of, like, Dr. Bronner's peppermint. You got to be careful with that one. . . STEWART: Yeah. GUTIERREZ: . . . Because it feel - you feel that, like, prickling kind of, like, coolness of that one. Yeah, you don't want to use it in all situations. STEWART: It's true. GUTIERREZ: So when it comes to fragrances especially, we talk about natural and synthetic smells. This is something of special interest to me. I love all kinds of scents, but I'm very sensitive to synthetic fragrance. Like, I get headaches. I don't feel well. Especially, a lot of times, it'll just be really overbearing to me. STEWART: Yeah. I mean, it's real. There's a condition called hyperosmia, which is this extreme sensitivity to smell. And it - a lot of people experience it in - during pregnancy, but, you know, for other people, it's more of a enduring thing. And, you know, it can produce migraines and has lots of real effects for people. GUTIERREZ: I always have to check labels for words - the words fragrance or perfume, so I keep looking for something without them. How do we actually define those terms, natural and synthetic? STEWART: Oh, that's a great question. So if you create a jasmine, you know, molecule in the lab and you get one from an actual flower, the molecules are going to be identical. They're going to be exactly the same. The question is, though, the molecules from the flower - there will be many different molecules. And did you get enough of the representative molecules to truly represent the fragrance of the flower? And just to make that more complex, flowers release smells all day long, depending on what kind of, like, bees they're trying to attract or insects. So, you know, if you're really very nuanced, as perfumers often are, they might, like, know that the smell in the morning is different from the afternoon or evening. There's many different molecules. So you might be sensing, more than anything, the, like - the incompleteness of this approximation in the lab. But you know what's interesting is that there are actually lab-invented molecules that have never existed that we can smell. I found that to be so amazing. You can make them in the lab, and you can smell them with your nose. So. . . GUTIERREZ: So something that doesn't exist in nature already. STEWART: Yeah. Yeah, I have a perfume that's called Molecule Five, and it's entirely, like, a lab-invented, you know, synthetic molecule. GUTIERREZ: I mean, I hope that since you have it - it's a perfume you have, like, does it smell good? Like, what does it smell like? Is there anything that you can compare it to? STEWART: (Laughter) Oh, OK. It smells like, I would say, like, a kind of a dead lily shading into smoke. It's sort of this very overblown, like, flowery smell. And I like that. . . GUTIERREZ: So specific. STEWART: I know. I like how weird it is. People like, what is that? You know, and we're like, this is one molecule that did not exist until 1976 or what have you - forget the exact year. But, you know, it - your mind kind of fills in some reference of what it must be, and I find that kind of cool. GUTIERREZ: But it also makes me think of - there's, like, this issue here, especially in Southern California, where there are people poaching white sage in the wild. There's this great LA Times article that really goes into depth about it. Poachers are endangering the plant so they can sell bundles for smudging online, on social media, whatnot. And so now you're kind of endangering something that is not only native to the land, but the native peoples - like Chumash and Tongva peoples have used it for different things. It makes me think that the pursuit of what is, quote-unquote, \"natural\" can actually be damaging sometimes. That - in some ways, it, like, makes the case for, like, having these be synthetic or synthesized scents. STEWART: I love that example, because it exactly gets at the complexity of, like, the issues at play. That - I mean, there are quite a few perfume ingredients that have been, you know, hunted almost to extinction. Like, you mentioned musk earlier. Well, musk used to come from the deer, and they would - you know, the deers became very endangered. There are many, many other things that come into play when you require every scent to come from the earth. It becomes very taxing on resources. So it's - synthetics do help with that problem. GUTIERREZ: Yeah. Do you find yourself letting your nose lead you through the world? STEWART: Oh, big time. Yes, yes. I think that smelling is kind of mindfulness turned inside out. You know, when you think about meditating, like, you're focused on your breath and you're focusing inward. And maybe you're saying a mantra or what have you. But when you smell, you're doing the same thing, but you're focusing on the world and it's like, your body in this particular place at this time. Smells don't last forever. They go away, you know, with the air movement. So it's like - it really pins you to a moment. And so I - yeah. I, like, can't ever unthink that thought, and I don't want to. GUTIERREZ: Well, Jude, thank you so much. I just really appreciate a really, like, fascinating look into the world of smell - smell into the world of smell and scent. But I really appreciate talking to you today. STEWART: Oh, this was such a pleasure. Thank you so much, Andrea.

In many cases, they have been the subject of posts by a Twitter account called Libs of TikTok. Despite the threats and harassment, this account continues to post fresh material, which may tell us something about what major online platforms such as Twitter consider to be threatening behavior. NPR's Shannon Bond has been following this. Hey there. SHANNON BOND, BYLINE: Hi. KELLY: OK. Tell me a little bit more about this account, Libs of TikTok. BOND: Yeah. So this is an account with 1. 3 million Twitter followers, and it regularly reposts videos and social media posts from regular people, teachers, schools and institutions. And often, these are taken out of context and framed to fuel outrage and to cast LGBTQ people as pedophiles. And, you know, Mary Louise, this comes amid, you know, a broader rise in anti-LGBTQ sentiment on the right. And this account has become very influential. These videos it posts often end up on Fox News. KELLY: And where do children's hospitals come into this picture? BOND: Well, in the past few weeks, this account has been posting a lot about children's hospitals, as you said, that provide health care to transgender kids. And in some cases, it's made false claims, like that hospitals are performing gender-affirming hysterectomies on young children. And I want to stop here to emphasize that this is not true. The hospitals say they do not do these surgeries specifically on patients under the age of 18. But the hospitals say these posts have sparked this wave of harassment and threats. I spoke with Dr. Angela Kaed Goepferd, who runs the Gender Health program at Children's Minnesota in Minneapolis. That hospital has not been targeted, but they've been watching this all play out. ANGELA KAED GOEPFERD: So I think the fact that it, you know, has - somewhere the message has gotten through that it's OK to attack physicians, pediatricians, children's hospitals in this way is just a really disturbing societal trend. KELLY: And yet, Shannon, the attacks continue. This account continues to post. Is Twitter doing anything about this? Does Twitter consider this harassment? BOND: I mean, it's kind of hard to tell, right? So Twitter, as well as Facebook and Instagram, where this account also posts - they all have rules against hate speech, harassment, including what's called brigading, where people coordinate to pile onto a target. The thing is the Libs of TikTok account isn't making direct threats itself, but these posts appear to be encouraging other people to do so. And we've seen other instances where this account has posted about Pride events, drag story hours of public libraries, and then right-wing extremist groups have shown up in those places. So this question, you know, for the platforms is, is Libs of TikTok responsible for any of this impact? Now, Twitter and Facebook wouldn't comment on the account, and I did reach out to the account owner for comment. She replied. She said she was open to an interview, but then she didn't respond when I tried to schedule it and didn't respond to any of my written questions. KELLY: What sort of impact has this had on hospitals, on doctors who work there? BOND: I mean, you can imagine it's been very difficult. This, of course, affects the safety of staff at hospitals. It's a resource drain to deal with these kinds of threats. And then there are wider ripple effects, right? I mean, there are impacts on patients who need this evidence-based medical care. And it affects other patients, too, if hospitals' communications or websites get overwhelmed because of the volume of threats that they're receiving. And so, you know, there's a lot to contend with here. Providers I spoke with say they're worried that there could be a chilling effect if transgender health care is even more stigmatized than it already is, that this could change how doctors practice. And then it could make it harder to get funding for research into the best care. KELLY: OK. Thank you, Shannon. BOND: Thanks, Mary Louise. KELLY: NPR's Shannon Bond.

So far this hour, we have mostly explored strange and unusual ways that people and companies disguise themselves. But it's something we all do every single day when we get dressed. GALA MARIJA VRBANIC: Why do we wear clothes? So, first of all, you need clothes to protect yourself, obviously. But how you choose your clothes - how do they look? This is fashion, and this is part of your identity, and this is how you want to be perceived. ZOMORODI: This is Croatian fashion designer Gala Marija Vrbanic. And a few years ago, she started a company called Tribute Brand, and she wanted to debut her work in a big way. VRBANIC: Our first dress is, like, a huge dress, golden dress with a bow and a corset. It's very simple, but it has a lot of volume. ZOMORODI: And when Gala says volume, she means volume. This dress looks like a huge balloon bent into a dress. It's made of gold with a humungous bow, massive. VRBANIC: It's big. It's couldn't fit your wardrobe or Room. It's very big. The other part is the material. So it has this very metallic golden material added to it, and it's very shiny and smooth. So it could be only done, like, if you look at, like, Jeff Koons sculpture or something like that, but it's a dress. ZOMORODI: And if you're thinking, who could possibly wear this dress, well, that's a rather analog question because Gala is a digital fashion designer, and this golden balloonlike gown, it only exists online in the virtual world, meaning you can't wear it on your actual body, but you could put it on a photo of yourself on Instagram. VRBANIC: It looks real in a manner that it looks perfectly fitted. So it looks real and unreal at the same time because you see a digital garment. You see there's something different. You see that this is not possible. And then you see it fitted on you like it was there. ZOMORODI: Designing digital fashion has opened Gala up to wild creative possibilities - like pants made of fire, anyone? VRBANIC: Now you have so many possibilities to create something totally crazy and never seen before. ZOMORODI: Other virtual outfits that she's made include a shirt made of butterflies, a dress that shoots lasers. And people are spending millions of real dollars shopping for virtual clothes online. VRBANIC: Our community are people who actually follow trends, like to set trends, but they're at the same time tech savvy, so they like to also experiment with the new technologies. And, you know, of course, it's younger people. We need fashion where we express ourselves, where we socialize. And this is currently happening, and it will happen even more inside online spaces. ZOMORODI: So from what I understand, part of your inspiration for creating cyber-fashion came from noticing that young people were buying and then immediately reselling expensive physical streetwear brands. So who was doing this? And why were they doing it? VRBANIC: So those are those kids that are buying streetwear, like Supreme, Off-White and, you know, all of those brands that supply very limited amount of clothing. So what I realized - they were gathering in those Facebook groups and reselling the garments they just bought. Like, 2 hours ago, they bought the garment, and then they're reselling. They just took a photo of themself wearing that garment, posted it on their Instagram, and then they didn't need it anymore because they've shown I got the garment, and then they resell it because they wanted to buy something new. And I just realized they just need an image of a garment in a virtual space. ZOMORODI: OK, so you saw this Instagram fashion trend happening, but you had also experienced dressing up virtually yourself 'cause you're into video games, right? VRBANIC: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, exactly. I was a fan of the game - and I still am - \"GTA,\" \"Grand Theft Auto. \"(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #1: (As character) Out of my car. UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #2: (As character) Not my wheels, man. That's my wheels. VRBANIC: I spent all of my childhood playing that game, and this is actually what brought me to digital fashion because my background is in traditional fashion. And my mom was - is a fashion designer, so I was always surrounded by fashion. But I was spending my time since childhood in those virtual spaces playing games. And I realized, like, all of the time I was playing that game, I was just going to, like, shops and buying clothing for my avatar. And then I realized that I cared more, like, how I look in those games than how I looked in physical world. And then I also realized that I'm not probably the only one because there was a reason there were so many stores in those games. ZOMORODI: I know that some people - like, if they are playing video games, they will spend money to buy, you know, a special cape or a special sword. Is that considered digital fashion? VRBANIC: It is. Everything you use to express your identity is fashion or digital fashion. And, you know, when we were young - what was very, you know, wrong, I think, with the games back then, that all of the characters were male characters. And you couldn't, you know, choose. This is why I like the clothes because this was how was I able to change my character and do whatever I want to do. ZOMORODI: I've heard that from a lot of gamers, especially people who, because of their gender identity or sexuality, that maybe they don't feel safe in the real world and that they really appreciate the freedom that virtual worlds can give them to be whomever they want. VRBANIC: Yeah, it's easier. People feel more safe and people feel more confident. It might be also a reason that online, they are creating that persona they want to be. They are not constrained by their own physical persona they can't move away from. And they're - in online spaces, they can be hundred percent what they want to be. So it's what we've been noticing. You know, it's very welcoming. It's very inclusive. And now they're, you know, totally free. ZOMORODI: OK, so cyber fashion is happening in gaming. It's happening on social media. But the place that I've been wondering about is augmented reality, like Google glasses or other wearable devices that are allegedly going to change the way we see the world around us. VRBANIC: I think AR glasses will bring us there very soon because right now, if you want to wear digital fashion in AR, you have to take your phone and you have to film it. So it's kind of - you know, it's not very convenient. With AR glasses, you can just put those glasses on yourself, and you look at around you, and you'll see that added layer instantly. And you'll see everything through it. ZOMORODI: What is it going to be like? Are we going to have an entire digital wardrobe? What if I decide I don't want to be a human? What if I want to be a hawk? Like, what will be possible? VRBANIC: That's the most exciting thing to me, because there are, I think, many, many people who don't want to look like humans. Once people realize they can be whatever they want to be - they can be a box, they can be a bear, they can be themselves, they can have multiple different identities - this is where I think - you know, it's kind of this, I would say, mindset shift is needed for people to realize. And of course, the tech is also needed. So it will happen with time. ZOMORODI: I think there are some people who might think that this is actually terrifying to them, that being a real person in the world who gets dressed every morning is hard enough as it is. The thought of having to do it for the virtual version of themselves seems exhausting and maybe a little scary. VRBANIC: Of course, of course. Yeah. I think, like, each time I'm speaking, you know, about fashion, I always say we are not doing anything new. We are just using a new medium. But basically, the principles that work inside traditional or physical fashion - like, the whole psychology around the product and why would anyone buy it and why would anyone need it - is the same in the digital space. And I think human psychology will always stay the same, just the medium where we are is different. And regarding fashion and identity expression, which is, like, I think, the most beautiful thing, is you'll be able to choose to whom and how you want to present yourself. So you'll be able to choose to wear multiple different outfits at the same time. ZOMORODI: Right. So let's say I'm walking down the street, and I see my kid's teacher. She might have chosen to look to me like she's wearing, you know, an old-fashioned, beautiful outfit - clothes, though. But if - maybe she's made it possible that if she runs into her friends, she looks like a peacock, like an actual bird. VRBANIC: That's right. Exactly. ZOMORODI: I mean, it's mind-boggling. VRBANIC: And this is - you know, this is just the surface, right now, we've been speaking about, you know? It can go in many different directions. ZOMORODI: I'm just scrolling through your Instagram, and there's a woman wearing a beautiful ball gown that looks as though it's electrified. There's another guy wearing what kind of looks like a superhero chest plate, but it's fitted to him kind of perfectly. There's another gown that's made out of sort of metallic, puffy material - like those Jeff Koons artworks. And her dog is wearing the same dress and also looks amazing. VRBANIC: Yeah, you can be anything, you know? ZOMORODI: You can be anything. VRBANIC: Yeah, and your dog, too.

Gray: The invisible \"ghost\" workforce powering our day-to-day lives : NPR", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2022/08/26/1119225419/mary-l-gray-the-invisible-ghost-workforce-powering-our-day-to-day-lives", "author": "No author found", "published_date": "2022-08-26", "content": "MANOUSH ZOMORODI, HOST:  So you may not realize it, but there are companies that go incognito so that they can smoothly and swiftly help you get through the day. MARY GRAY: So let's imagine you're running late to a meeting or trying to get home and, you know, too far to walk. Maybe you don't have public transit. ZOMORODI: This is anthropologist Mary Gray. GRAY: And so you decide to order a Lyft or Uber or some - even a taxi. And after a few seconds, your driver accepts your request for the ride. ZOMORODI: Let's call him Sam. GRAY: Unbeknownst to you, Sam shaved off his beard last night. And this only matters because, for a company like Uber, for example, it has all of their drivers verify their IDs with pictures. So the picture verification that a driver like Sam might send in the morning may not match his photo ID that's on record. That's going to set off an automated alarm bill for Uber. (SOUNDBITE OF CAR HORN HONKING)ZOMORODI: Sam doesn't know it, but before he picks you up, halfway across the world, a woman named Ayesha is quickly checking his ID. GRAY: And in front of Ayesha is going to pop up those two faces - a photo of Sam that's on record and the photo he just took where he doesn't have his beard anymore. And her job is, within seconds - quite literally, as a timer is ticking down - to identify, is this the same person? ZOMORODI: She squints at her screen with just moments to decide, is the clean-shaven guy really your Uber driver? Ayesha decides, yep, that's Sam. GRAY: When she clicks yes, it's funneled into Sam's account, and he's none the wiser. He has no idea that his ride could have been rejected. (SOUNDBITE OF CAR DOOR SHUTTING)GRAY: And then you're on your way to the meeting. Sam's behind the wheel. You're both completely unaware that Ayesha has actually facilitated you being able to get back to the office or to get home in time for dinner. ZOMORODI: This work, this micro-job that Ayesha did, is what Mary describes as ghost work. For the past decade, she's been researching how millions of people like Ayesha make our interactions with companies like Uber, Amazon, Google and Microsoft appear seamless. GRAY: In many ways, it's the people behind the screen who are doing content moderation, data labeling and a host of other activities that, for the most part, we have no idea are integral to making the internet work. ZOMORODI: So me - in this scenario, I trust that the app is not going to send a, you know, axe murderer to come pick me up. Why? Why doesn't the app want us to know that there are these humans doing really important work to keep us safe? Why do they keep it under wraps? GRAY: Well, the hard part is that in most cases, the assumption is, as the consumer, you don't want to be bothered. But there isn't a way to have this kind of what seems frictionless, smooth experience as a consumer without having also a process that verifies who's behind the wheel. There is no computational system that can identify a person with 100% accuracy every single time. And so Ayesha becomes necessary just for a moment. But we're sold the magic that Ayesha doesn't exist at all, that it's just the algorithms doing the work. ZOMORODI: To be clear, it's not as though everything on these apps - like when you call a car or you get food delivered or whatever the case might be - it's not all invisible humans working behind the scenes. GRAY: No. ZOMORODI: They - it's a - it's this crucial combination - right? - of algorithms, artificial intelligence and humans. Where does the line get drawn? GRAY: So the dirty little secret of the past 10, 15 years is that there is no way to automatically update information and verify its accuracy. So we've always had people involved in a moment of looking at information and saying, yes, that's the accurate spelling of a book; yes, that is information that is still living on a website. It's not just a dead link. There's some of that work that can be automated, but there's quite a bit that cannot. And so it's a moving target for computer science and engineering to figure out what can you automate. ZOMORODI: I wonder - you know, it feels like smoke and mirrors a lot of the time. And I guess it feels like ghost work and not telling us that there are humans doing a lot of the things that we take for granted when we use our phone and computers - like, it feels like deception. GRAY: Yeah. So I think tech companies are pretending to be something they're not because they're kind of faking it until they make it. As long as it seems like we want things done for us through robots or through AI, they'll keep trying. So this is really important because we haven't had the general public aware enough that artificial intelligence cannot solve all the problems. But I think also we are just coming to grips, both the engineering parts of the house and society, with, wow, this is intractably hard to fix. ZOMORODI: When we come back, more with Mary Gray and about what it takes to be an on-demand online worker. It's the TED Radio Hour from NPR. I'm Manoush Zomorodi. We'll be right back. ZOMORODI: It's the TED Radio Hour from NPR. I'm Manoush Zomorodi, and on the show today, going incognito. And we were just talking to anthropologist Mary Gray about the mostly invisible workforce that keeps many of our apps and services running. GRAY: It's the people behind the screen who are doing content moderation, data labeling and a host of other activities that, for the most part, we have no idea are integral to making the internet work. ZOMORODI: These companies hire people to do short, quick tasks - ghost work. And this workforce, Mary says, is growing quickly. GRAY: 2016 - there was a research study that was done by McKinsey, and they estimated that in the U. S. and Europe alone, there are around 25 million people who have done some form of this on-demand gig work online. At that rate of growth, if you combined the current trend in contract staffing, temp agency services, that's, like, 60% - six zero - 60% of today's global employment could likely be converted into some form of this kind of on-demand gig work by 2055. ZOMORODI: Whoa. That's a lot of people. GRAY: That's not that far out. ZOMORODI: Yeah. And it's not like these are easy jobs. You have found that people are often paid cents per minute, and they have to work incredibly fast but also be extremely accurate. GRAY: Yeah, the intense pressure and low pay is fairly common. And that's because this is - I would argue today, it's unregulated work. I mean, this is contract labor that is constantly changing. It's like a steady stream of what's next that you need to vet or classify or sort. And at the same time, it's cognitively draining. I think the irony here - let's take the example of content moderation. When we started this work, I think most people imagined that that was work that would go away once we automated identifying content that should be removed. ZOMORODI: Right. I mean, that's what Mark Zuckerberg told us, right? GRAY: I think that's what he believed. I mean, I think if you're a techno-optimist or someone who's just relentlessly committed to fixing something with technology, it's awfully hard to see problems that are perhaps beyond the reach of technology. ZOMORODI: OK. But we have to say there is a plus side to some of this work, too, right? I mean, it fits in with people's lives. In some cases, they may not be able to work at all if they don't take these tasks. GRAY: Yeah, it's appealing. And I think it's important to see, why is it appealing? It's a response to what's not working in employment today. We met people who were doing this work because they had no choice. There were no other good job options. They were trying to control their schedules that often had to do with family care. So for many people, it's about controlling their time. The other thing they're trying to control is what they work on. You know, they wanted to be able to pursue interests. So, for example, Natalie was someone we met - African American woman who was living with her parents in Queens. She was in her late 20s, early 30s. So for her - for Natalie, this was a chance to be able to do work that could generate an income and also balance her interest in music and choreography. So she wanted to balance her - what she was working on that - in a way that would give her room to do what she really wanted to do, which was her art. ZOMORODI: The theme of our show is incognito, and I was trying to think - I'm like, so who is incognito? Who is in disguise? Is it the ghost workers themselves, that they are disguised by the technology? Or is it the companies who are saying, here's where we are. We're amazing. Look at what we can do, and it's so fast and it barely costs you anything. Use Uber. It's only $5 for you to drive, you know, all the way to Midtown, in my case. Who is doing the disguising? Who is incognito in your mind? GRAY: This is where it is really important to say the workers are not incognito. Just because we can't see them doesn't mean they aren't carrying out really valuable work. And importantly, they see each other every day online. They connect with each other. I would say right now, it's the tech companies that are incognito, that have - whether with intention or not - put off recognizing - seeing the value of the people who are critical to their contributions, to their services to consumers. To a lesser extent, in some ways, consumers are just asleep at the wheel. And now that we are learning to pay attention to how many people have a role in us having an experience online or being able to have an app whisk us away or bring us food - now that we know that involves even more people than we realized before, are we ready and willing to pay our fair share? ZOMORODI: So if you're saying that these jobs aren't going anywhere, that they're absolutely needed by these companies, why don't they build this workforce into something that is reliable and high quality? GRAY: Well, I think we could. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)GRAY: Most of the labor laws that we reference as the things that create security, that create safety on the job, they come from the 1930s, literally. Like, we have no good laws in place that have recognized the current relationship we have to technology and how it mediates all of our work lives. We haven't even begun to think about what that means globally and for a globally connected workforce that works around the clock through the internet. ZOMORODI: That was anthropologist Mary Gray, and she wrote her book \"Ghost Work\" with computer scientist Siddharth Suri. You can see her full talk at ted. com. MANOUSH ZOMORODI, HOST:   So you may not realize it, but there are companies that go incognito so that they can smoothly and swiftly help you get through the day. MARY GRAY: So let's imagine you're running late to a meeting or trying to get home and, you know, too far to walk. Maybe you don't have public transit. ZOMORODI: This is anthropologist Mary Gray. GRAY: And so you decide to order a Lyft or Uber or some - even a taxi. And after a few seconds, your driver accepts your request for the ride. ZOMORODI: Let's call him Sam. GRAY: Unbeknownst to you, Sam shaved off his beard last night. And this only matters because, for a company like Uber, for example, it has all of their drivers verify their IDs with pictures. So the picture verification that a driver like Sam might send in the morning may not match his photo ID that's on record. That's going to set off an automated alarm bill for Uber. (SOUNDBITE OF CAR HORN HONKING) ZOMORODI: Sam doesn't know it, but before he picks you up, halfway across the world, a woman named Ayesha is quickly checking his ID. GRAY: And in front of Ayesha is going to pop up those two faces - a photo of Sam that's on record and the photo he just took where he doesn't have his beard anymore. And her job is, within seconds - quite literally, as a timer is ticking down - to identify, is this the same person? ZOMORODI: She squints at her screen with just moments to decide, is the clean-shaven guy really your Uber driver? Ayesha decides, yep, that's Sam. GRAY: When she clicks yes, it's funneled into Sam's account, and he's none the wiser. He has no idea that his ride could have been rejected. (SOUNDBITE OF CAR DOOR SHUTTING) GRAY: And then you're on your way to the meeting. Sam's behind the wheel. You're both completely unaware that Ayesha has actually facilitated you being able to get back to the office or to get home in time for dinner. ZOMORODI: This work, this micro-job that Ayesha did, is what Mary describes as ghost work. For the past decade, she's been researching how millions of people like Ayesha make our interactions with companies like Uber, Amazon, Google and Microsoft appear seamless. GRAY: In many ways, it's the people behind the screen who are doing content moderation, data labeling and a host of other activities that, for the most part, we have no idea are integral to making the internet work. ZOMORODI: So me - in this scenario, I trust that the app is not going to send a, you know, axe murderer to come pick me up. Why? Why doesn't the app want us to know that there are these humans doing really important work to keep us safe? Why do they keep it under wraps? GRAY: Well, the hard part is that in most cases, the assumption is, as the consumer, you don't want to be bothered. But there isn't a way to have this kind of what seems frictionless, smooth experience as a consumer without having also a process that verifies who's behind the wheel. There is no computational system that can identify a person with 100% accuracy every single time. And so Ayesha becomes necessary just for a moment. But we're sold the magic that Ayesha doesn't exist at all, that it's just the algorithms doing the work. ZOMORODI: To be clear, it's not as though everything on these apps - like when you call a car or you get food delivered or whatever the case might be - it's not all invisible humans working behind the scenes. GRAY: No. ZOMORODI: They - it's a - it's this crucial combination - right? - of algorithms, artificial intelligence and humans. Where does the line get drawn? GRAY: So the dirty little secret of the past 10, 15 years is that there is no way to automatically update information and verify its accuracy. So we've always had people involved in a moment of looking at information and saying, yes, that's the accurate spelling of a book; yes, that is information that is still living on a website. It's not just a dead link. There's some of that work that can be automated, but there's quite a bit that cannot. And so it's a moving target for computer science and engineering to figure out what can you automate. ZOMORODI: I wonder - you know, it feels like smoke and mirrors a lot of the time. And I guess it feels like ghost work and not telling us that there are humans doing a lot of the things that we take for granted when we use our phone and computers - like, it feels like deception. GRAY: Yeah. So I think tech companies are pretending to be something they're not because they're kind of faking it until they make it. As long as it seems like we want things done for us through robots or through AI, they'll keep trying. So this is really important because we haven't had the general public aware enough that artificial intelligence cannot solve all the problems. But I think also we are just coming to grips, both the engineering parts of the house and society, with, wow, this is intractably hard to fix. ZOMORODI: When we come back, more with Mary Gray and about what it takes to be an on-demand online worker. It's the TED Radio Hour from NPR. I'm Manoush Zomorodi. We'll be right back. ZOMORODI: It's the TED Radio Hour from NPR. I'm Manoush Zomorodi, and on the show today, going incognito. And we were just talking to anthropologist Mary Gray about the mostly invisible workforce that keeps many of our apps and services running. GRAY: It's the people behind the screen who are doing content moderation, data labeling and a host of other activities that, for the most part, we have no idea are integral to making the internet work. ZOMORODI: These companies hire people to do short, quick tasks - ghost work. And this workforce, Mary says, is growing quickly. GRAY: 2016 - there was a research study that was done by McKinsey, and they estimated that in the U. S. and Europe alone, there are around 25 million people who have done some form of this on-demand gig work online. At that rate of growth, if you combined the current trend in contract staffing, temp agency services, that's, like, 60% - six zero - 60% of today's global employment could likely be converted into some form of this kind of on-demand gig work by 2055. ZOMORODI: Whoa. That's a lot of people. GRAY: That's not that far out. ZOMORODI: Yeah. And it's not like these are easy jobs. You have found that people are often paid cents per minute, and they have to work incredibly fast but also be extremely accurate. GRAY: Yeah, the intense pressure and low pay is fairly common. And that's because this is - I would argue today, it's unregulated work. I mean, this is contract labor that is constantly changing. It's like a steady stream of what's next that you need to vet or classify or sort. And at the same time, it's cognitively draining. I think the irony here - let's take the example of content moderation. When we started this work, I think most people imagined that that was work that would go away once we automated identifying content that should be removed. ZOMORODI: Right. I mean, that's what Mark Zuckerberg told us, right? GRAY: I think that's what he believed. I mean, I think if you're a techno-optimist or someone who's just relentlessly committed to fixing something with technology, it's awfully hard to see problems that are perhaps beyond the reach of technology. ZOMORODI: OK. But we have to say there is a plus side to some of this work, too, right? I mean, it fits in with people's lives. In some cases, they may not be able to work at all if they don't take these tasks. GRAY: Yeah, it's appealing. And I think it's important to see, why is it appealing? It's a response to what's not working in employment today. We met people who were doing this work because they had no choice. There were no other good job options. They were trying to control their schedules that often had to do with family care. So for many people, it's about controlling their time. The other thing they're trying to control is what they work on. You know, they wanted to be able to pursue interests. So, for example, Natalie was someone we met - African American woman who was living with her parents in Queens. She was in her late 20s, early 30s. So for her - for Natalie, this was a chance to be able to do work that could generate an income and also balance her interest in music and choreography. So she wanted to balance her - what she was working on that - in a way that would give her room to do what she really wanted to do, which was her art. ZOMORODI: The theme of our show is incognito, and I was trying to think - I'm like, so who is incognito? Who is in disguise? Is it the ghost workers themselves, that they are disguised by the technology? Or is it the companies who are saying, here's where we are. We're amazing. Look at what we can do, and it's so fast and it barely costs you anything. Use Uber. It's only $5 for you to drive, you know, all the way to Midtown, in my case. Who is doing the disguising? Who is incognito in your mind? GRAY: This is where it is really important to say the workers are not incognito. Just because we can't see them doesn't mean they aren't carrying out really valuable work. And importantly, they see each other every day online. They connect with each other. I would say right now, it's the tech companies that are incognito, that have - whether with intention or not - put off recognizing - seeing the value of the people who are critical to their contributions, to their services to consumers. To a lesser extent, in some ways, consumers are just asleep at the wheel. And now that we are learning to pay attention to how many people have a role in us having an experience online or being able to have an app whisk us away or bring us food - now that we know that involves even more people than we realized before, are we ready and willing to pay our fair share? ZOMORODI: So if you're saying that these jobs aren't going anywhere, that they're absolutely needed by these companies, why don't they build this workforce into something that is reliable and high quality?

MANOUSH ZOMORODI, HOST:  It's the TED Radio Hour from NPR. I'm Manoush Zomorodi. On the show today, incognito. And what if we can disguise and manipulate our voices to do things that no human can do? Well, it gets really confusing. This is artist Holly Herndon on the TED stage, playing a recording of what sounds like her singing. But here's the thing. HOLLY HERNDON: So that was my voice. But that wasn't me singing. ZOMORODI: So who was it, then? HERNDON: So that was actually a machine learning model trained on my voice that can read scores in Catalan. So I've been working with machine learning for years, and I've been attempting to create a kind of version - a machine learning model of my voice that could perform beyond my own physical limitations. And so just recently, I've been able to achieve this. And not only can this version of myself sing in English but also in multiple other languages. ZOMORODI: Holly calls her software, appropriately, Holly+. And, yeah, Holly+ can read notes on sheet music, and it can do this. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"MACK THE KNIFE\")HOLLY+: (Singing in German). ZOMORODI: Sing a German rendition of \"Mack The Knife\" or. . . (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"BESAME MUCHO\")HOLLY+: (Singing in Spanish). ZOMORODI: . . . Sing the classic Latin hit \"Besame Mucho. \" But I just want to reiterate Holly the person does not speak Spanish, and she has never sung these songs. Holly+ is singing these songs. And it can do it in any language and in any vocal range. HERNDON: I trained a machine learning model on hours of my natural singing voice. So this required that I sang the entirety of the range of phonemes in the English language. So what does that mean? That means all of the kind of sounds that I would potentially make in the English language. So what I would do is I would sing from a set of phrases that are specifically designed to cover all of the sounds that I could create in English. ZOMORODI: Phrases like what? HERNDON: Well, I don't have the script in front of me, but you can find them pretty easily online. They're called TIMIT scripts, and they're really kind of random phrases. I think one phrase that pops into mind is that quick beige fox jumps in the air. Surprise, he shouts. Just kind of random things like that where (laughter). . . ZOMORODI: I love it. HERNDON: . . . It's kind of nonsense. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"TRAS DE TI\")HOLLY+: (Singing in Spanish). HERNDON: And so then that is mapped onto other languages and I can kind of create this multilingual voice that can sing, you know, beyond my own physical capability. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"TRAS DE TI\")HOLLY+: (Singing in Spanish). ZOMORODI: From what I've read, it took you and your collaborators years to get Holly+ working so that you can give it instructions and it spits out a remarkably lifelike song. And that is what we have heard so far on the show. HERNDON: Yes. ZOMORODI: But at the end of your TED Talk, you took Holly+ to another level. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)HERNDON: So I invite you to consider, if given the opportunity, who would you like to perform through? And can you imagine someone else performing you? With that in mind, I'd like to invite the incredible musician Pher to the stage. (APPLAUSE)ZOMORODI: You invited another singer on stage, a man named Pher. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)PHER: (Vocalizing). ZOMORODI: Pher sang into a mic that he was holding in his right hand. He has a beautiful voice. But then he sang into another microphone, held in his other hand. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)PHER AND HOLLY+: (Vocalizing). (APPLAUSE)ZOMORODI: And we heard a live version of Holly+, which was adapting his voice into your voice in real time. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)PHER: (Singing) When you come around acting this way. And. . . PHER AND HOLLY+: (Singing) Yes, the truth is I show you every day. HOLLY+: (Singing) 'Cause you love to stay. . . (APPLAUSE)HOLLY+: (Singing) . . . Living in all the pain. ZOMORODI: Holly, it was so weird to see a Black man wearing glasses - someone who looks completely different than you - open his mouth and have your voice come out of it and have complete and total artistic control of your voice. . . (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)HOLLY+: (Singing) There ain't no leaving me. . . ZOMORODI: . . . With you standing right next to him with your mouth shut. HERNDON: Exactly (laughter). Exactly. ZOMORODI: I mean, it was surreal. But, you know, it was also kind of disturbing. How would you describe the audience's response? HERNDON: Well, you know, when you're standing on the stage, you just see the lights, so you kind of can't really see so much. But I felt like at the end of the talk, you know, everyone seemed really happy and were kind of applauding and seemed kind of flabbergasted a little bit. But it was really interesting to also have some conversations after the performance with different people and to hear different people's concerns, of course. And. . . ZOMORODI: What were their concerns? Do you remember? HERNDON: Well, I mean, I think it's really, like, fully understandable that musicians - it's usually coming from musicians, vocalists themselves, who are then worried, like, OK, what does this mean for the sovereignty of my voice? Like, if anyone can just jump in my body and sing with my voice, what does that mean for me personally? And that's a real concern, and it's one that needs to be taken very seriously. ZOMORODI: What do you tell them? How do you say, like, well, you know what? We're going to figure that out. Or what do you say? HERNDON: Well, that is something I'm actually actively working on to figure out at the moment. My partner and I have started an organization called Spawning. And so we're trying to figure out this really thorny question of ownership and custody of one's own model - what kind of interactions we can build around that with fans that works for the artist. There's a very justified kind of wariness for new technology. So I think the only way to really deal with it is to kind of meet it head on because it's happening. It's coming. My answer to that would be that everyone should have the ownership and the ability to custody their own model and to be able to decide whether or not they want to make that public or whether or not they want to keep that to themselves or whether or not they want to license that to people. I think that should be a personal choice. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ZOMORODI: So I think there are going to be people listening who are really excited by this technology. But then there are going to be others who are like, why? Like, why? Cool party trick, but why? HERNDON: Well, why? I think that there's many kind of artistic reasons why someone might want to perform through someone else's vocal timbre - for example, even just kind of the range. So if you have a baritone range and maybe you would like to know what it's like to sing as a soprano, you know? Or - it's - you're kind of changing your bodily resonance by being able to jump into someone else's vocal timbre. And I think, you know, with me, it's maybe less exciting. But with someone like a Beyonce, maybe some - maybe her fans would love to make a kind of series of songs in homage to their queen. And so I could see other voices being really revered by fans and creating a whole kind of ecosystem of fan-generated art and fan-generated music that could be actually really fun and interactive. ZOMORODI: OK, so I guess Beyonce - I mean, I don't claim to ever speak for Beyonce - but I guess she might say, well, that's not OK if you are writing your own music and using my voice and then selling it. HERNDON: She might very well say that, and I think that should be entirely up to her. I don't think that should be up to her record label or up to her publisher or up to anyone else but her. ZOMORODI: So we've mostly been talking in the musician or artistic way of using the software. But, you know, most of us have probably heard of this ability to transform a voice as - like those fake videos of President Obama saying things that he has never said or other deepfake voices. That's what's going to come to mind for most people. HERNDON: Yeah. I mean, I think - I try to avoid the deepfake phrase because I feel like it has such negative connotations around trickery and scamming people and whatnot. I see this technology as a really interesting way for people to find new ways to perform. So there's kind of two sides to this coin. There's the dystopian side, where we're using this technology to cheat people or fake people. And then the other side to that coin is to ask, OK, what if we could create digital versions of ourselves and allowed other people to perform through us, and we could perform through other people with their permission? What might that unlock? What kind of weird, new performance styles and genres could that create? What kind of new art forms would come out of that? So I'm trying to look at it from a more optimistic perspective, but I think that also requires consent. ZOMORODI: OK. So let's say everyone's in. There's consent. Let's go back to what you were saying about, you know, the average person or average baritone being able to sing a soprano. It's kind of the ultimate disguise in some ways. What does it feel like? Have you ever sung into a microphone and had your voice come out sounding like someone else? Or right now, is it just your voice that you're doing this with? HERNDON: Well, the only voice model I have is my own voice, so it's not really as spectacular when I do it. ZOMORODI: No. No, you're missing out, clearly. HERNDON: (Laughter) I am. But I definitely have plans to expand the catalog of voices. But also, you know, my - you know, my journey with machine learning and voice processing - you know, it didn't really just start five years ago. One of the reasons why I got into this topic in general is because I've been working with the digitally processed voice for over a decade now. And so I started doing that back in the day when I was a computer musician, and I was looking for a way to make my computer music performance more embodied. And so I started using my voice as a kind of data stream as a way to control different parameters on my computer. I never really thought of myself as a vocalist in that way. So I very much relate to this idea of using computer processing to be able to create sound beyond the physical limitations of my voice. That's something I've been really obsessed with for a very long time now, and it's an incredibly beautiful feeling on stage when I can sing into a microphone and I can rumble an entire auditorium with a huge kind of, like, engulfing subbass that I've mapped to my voice. That's a really wonderful and beautiful, empowering feeling. So I think it can be really transformative in that way. (SOUNDBITE OF HOLLY HERNDON SONG, \"CHORUS\")ZOMORODI: That's artist Holly Herndon. If you want to hear what else Holly can do with her voice and computers, you can find all her music online, like this track, \"Chorus,\" from her album \"Proto. \" You can, of course, watch her full talk at ted. com.

I see this technology as a really interesting way for people to find new ways to perform. So there's kind of two sides to this coin. There's the dystopian side, where we're using this technology to cheat people or fake people. And then the other side to that coin is to ask, OK, what if we could create digital versions of ourselves and allowed other people to perform through us, and we could perform through other people with their permission? What might that unlock? What kind of weird, new performance styles and genres could that create? What kind of new art forms would come out of that? So I'm trying to look at it from a more optimistic perspective, but I think that also requires consent. ZOMORODI: OK. So let's say everyone's in. There's consent. Let's go back to what you were saying about, you know, the average person or average baritone being able to sing a soprano. It's kind of the ultimate disguise in some ways. What does it feel like? Have you ever sung into a microphone and had your voice come out sounding like someone else? Or right now, is it just your voice that you're doing this with? HERNDON: Well, the only voice model I have is my own voice, so it's not really as spectacular when I do it. ZOMORODI: No. No, you're missing out, clearly. HERNDON: (Laughter) I am. But I definitely have plans to expand the catalog of voices. But also, you know, my - you know, my journey with machine learning and voice processing - you know, it didn't really just start five years ago. One of the reasons why I got into this topic in general is because I've been working with the digitally processed voice for over a decade now. And so I started doing that back in the day when I was a computer musician, and I was looking for a way to make my computer music performance more embodied. And so I started using my voice as a kind of data stream as a way to control different parameters on my computer. I never really thought of myself as a vocalist in that way. So I very much relate to this idea of using computer processing to be able to create sound beyond the physical limitations of my voice. That's something I've been really obsessed with for a very long time now, and it's an incredibly beautiful feeling on stage when I can sing into a microphone and I can rumble an entire auditorium with a huge kind of, like, engulfing subbass that I've mapped to my voice. That's a really wonderful and beautiful, empowering feeling. So I think it can be really transformative in that way.

So the social media company took him to court to make him follow through on the purchase. Most legal observers say Twitter has a pretty good case, but a whistleblower complaint may have just improved the chances that the world's richest man can get out of the deal. NPR's Raquel Maria Dillon is here to help us understand why. Welcome. RAQUEL MARIA DILLON, BYLINE: Thank you. RASCOE: So Elon Musk is hoping that this, you know, whistleblower could give him a boost in court. Why is that? DILLON: Well, 'cause the federal regulatory complaint from Twitter's former head of security, Peiter \"Mudge\" Zatko, says that Twitter has some serious problems. His complaint says Twitter doesn't protect user data and didn't insulate itself from foreign influence. And basically, that makes the company look like a dumpster fire, cybersecurity wise. It means it could be in violation of regulatory orders and at risk of getting hacked. These allegations are a gift to Musk. His team of attorneys is now switching gears and using Zatko's claims to help build a better legal defense. RASCOE: So how does this help Musk, exactly? DILLON: Well, legal experts say his original arguments were pretty flimsy. Previously, he claimed that Twitter wasn't forthcoming about how it counts spam bots or fake accounts on the platform. But Musk chose not to check the company out before he agreed to buy it. It's called due diligence. Twitter is standing by its statements about account estimates, and it claims the bot argument is just irrelevant. But now there are serious public accusations that Twitter is dysfunctional. And there could be regulatory penalties, meaning Twitter could be on the hook for fines. Musk's lawyers are now arguing that this makes the company damaged goods and could even be considered fraud. It's definitely not what he had signed up to buy for $44 billion. So he has subpoenaed Zatko and sent another termination letter asking to get out of the merger for all of these brand-new reasons. RASCOE: So can he actually switch up his legal arguments at this point in the case? DILLON: Well, that is up for a judge in Delaware to decide. She has to sign off on Musk's attempt to switch gears. Here is business law professor Ann Lipton from Tulane University. She says this is pretty rare. ANN LIPTON: I can't even think of anything, like, precedent for it. I mean, this whole new thing happened right in the middle. And it's - part of the reason it happened was because Musk didn't do due diligence. I mean, nobody buys a company without doing due diligence. DILLON: So if the judge agrees to hear Musk's new claims out, she'll probably also have to delay the trial from October to November. The court has to consider the new filings about Zatko's allegations. But at the same time, it's supposed to move quickly. Companies come to this court specifically - the Delaware Chancery Court - to resolve corporate disputes because they want to avoid uncertainty and costly delays. RASCOE: So, Raquel, can we just kind of step back for a moment? You know, Musk was the person who went after Twitter. The company wasn't trying to get him to buy it. He on his own decided this is what he wanted to do. Why is there this big fight right now to make him make good on the deal? DILLON: Well, as a social media platform, Twitter plays an outsized role in public discourse. But financially, it has not been that profitable. Its board is responsible for providing maximum value to its shareholders. So when Musk came round with $44 billion to buy it back in April, that seemed like a pretty good deal to the board. Today, it seems like an even better deal for the stockholders, at least. And who knows what harm might come given these security allegations when it comes to Twitter's bottom line going forward. So right now, Musk seems like the best chance Twitter has. RASCOE: NPR's Raquel Maria Dillon, thank you. DILLON: My pleasure.

One Michigan man is building his own high-speed service, and he's already hooked up dozens of neighbors who still relied on dial-up. NPR's Emma Bowman has the story. EMMA BOWMAN, BYLINE: Before the pandemic forced many of us to work from home, Jared Mauch had been at it for almost 20 years. But his hunt for good internet was unending. When he first moved to rural Michigan in a town not far from Ann Arbor, his job set him up with a great internet connection, while many of his neighbors were still stuck in the slow days of dial-up. JARED MAUCH: My company provided a T1 line, which was really great. It's 1. 5 megabit up and down. BOWMAN: But that was 2002. MAUCH: And eventually, over time, as the number of children we had grew and as the business activities that I did for my employers, this really was no longer meeting my needs. BOWMAN: But when he started shopping around, he wasn't happy with his options. The internet speeds from AT&T were painfully slow. Comcast wanted to charge him an upfront fee of $50,000. He opted for a third route. Rather than shell out money, only to have to depend on the whims of an internet service provider, he started his own fiber ISP. MAUCH: It ended up being a 10-year project. I ended up creating the company eventually in 2017, getting permits in 2019, sent out letters to everyone, let them know that, you know, construction was going to be starting. BOWMAN: In August of 2020, he was officially in business, just in time for his kids to start virtual school during the pandemic. MAUCH: And it was great. I have this fiber at my home that I controlled and could deliver the type of service that I really wanted to have. BOWMAN: Along the way, he also hooked up neighbors to his fiber line, and those neighbors told their neighbors. Now he's got 70 customers. The federal government, meanwhile, has been pouring billions into fiber infrastructure in recent years, especially in unserved rural areas, where experts say the Comcasts and AT&Ts of the world often aren't expanding because they don't see a return on investment. But Gary Bolton, CEO of the Fiber Broadband Association, says people like Mauch aren't waiting around for governments to get the money needed to get decent internet. GARY BOLTON: You have these rugged individuals we could call mavericks that have gone out to see how they can solve an issue with their community and set up broadband connection to their home and then to their neighbors. You know, some of them have been able to build it without government assistance. BOWMAN: In all, Mauch says he spent about $300,000 out of his own pocket building his service. MAUCH: I managed to sign up enough customers along the way that I've been breaking even. My goal wasn't necessarily to make a lot of money doing this but be able to connect to people that really needed it. BOWMAN: But now those federal funds are flowing. Mauch is getting $2. 6 million to continue his work, thanks to a COVID-19 relief package that allocated $15 million to the county of Washtenaw, where Mauch lives. With that money, Mauch plans to get 600 more homes connected, about a quarter of the work that needs to be done to get his county to 100% reliable internet. He usually charges about $200 for installation, with monthly rates starting at $65. He tries to keep his prices fair. MAUCH: Some people have the means to support the projects, and some people don't. And I've adapted my approach for every person in how I market to the homes and when I interact with them. BOWMAN: And at least for now, he seems to be keeping his neighbors happy. MAUCH: So far, I've lost zero customers. Everybody that's gotten connected has stayed connected. BOWMAN: Emma Bowman, NPR News.

I'm Dave Davies, in for Terry Gross. When congressional leaders grilled social media executives last year about spreading misinformation on the 2020 election and COVID-19, most of the heat was on Facebook, Twitter and the search engine Google. Our guest, business writer Mark Bergen, says far less attention is focused on YouTube, the video-sharing platform, which last year earned $28 billion in ad revenue and which has over 2 billion viewers around the world. Bergen's new book tells the story of YouTube's founding in 2005 on the simple idea of letting everyone share videos on the internet for free, and he describes the company's chaotic growth into a business giant. It's a platform that's allowed a 9-year-old boy whose videos began appearing when he was 3 to become a multimillionaire with his own toy and clothing brands. It's also given enormous exposure to Alex Jones and other conspiracy theorists. Bergen writes that YouTube has ushered in a world of abundant content and creativity of influencers and online hustlers, of information overload and endless culture wars. Mark Bergen writes for Bloomberg and Bloomberg Businessweek and previously reported on technology and media for Recode and Ad Age. He covered business and economics from India writing for The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and other publications. His new book is \"Like, Comment, Subscribe: Inside YouTube's Chaotic Rise To World Domination. \"Mark Bergen, welcome to FRESH AIR. Let's begin with YouTube's origin. In 2005, this was when there were hundreds of internet startups spawning everywhere, and most didn't take off. Tell us about the founding of YouTube, what its originators wanted to do. MARK BERGEN: Yeah, this was a wave, a revolutionary wave of what we call user-generated content on the internet - so not just websites where people would go and scroll and read, but they could actually participate. And so you had Blogger around that same time, Flickr, the photo-sharing app. Facebook was formed in 2004. And then, months later, there were three friends who had worked at PayPal that had got together. They had this idea. They wanted to do something on video. Video flip cameras were just becoming popular. You know, video was beginning to appear on the internet. But it was still very difficult to share and expensive and cumbersome. And so they - in early 2005, they began working on this site. There wasn't a lot of clarity in the sense that people would be posting amateur content or homemade videos, let alone that users and viewers would want to watch that. So they really stumbled upon this success by building a service that was pretty simple to use. Early on, it had that, you know, iconic triangular play button. It was able to embed in different websites. And once it took off with a lot of early creators - what we call now creators experimenting with it, it really hasn't slowed down since. DAVIES: Yeah, it's kind of remarkable. I mean, the idea is - I mean, the slogan was, broadcast yourself. Anybody could upload anything for free, right? BERGEN: Yeah. I think this was still a pretty novel idea and part of this Silicon Valley firm belief that information should be free and be accessible, and broadcast and video should be free and accessible and eventually will be. And YouTube was one of many, but it certainly became the - early on, leapfrogged around its competitors in part because it was so accessible and easy to use. You know, the founders talked about it in emails. This is something that they talked about how their mom should be able to use. And I think, to their credit, that's one of the reasons for its success. DAVIES: Right. So anybody could post anything. And who knew that, like, amateur videos would get an audience? But one of the things that they did early on was they knew that they wanted to find high-quality stuff and promote it. And so they created a group of people they called coolhunters. What was their mission? BERGEN: So at one point, there was a team of - they called themselves community managers. They sometimes called themselves editors. And they would pick the videos that would appear on the homepage. And they had different categories like sports and music and comedy. And some of that was sort of tapping into these early viral video hits. And they were also, like, sifting through. You know, one of them compared it to, like, looking through a record bin - right? - trying to go back and find these hidden gems because this is when YouTube was starting to get this influx of material from all around the world, and they hadn't built this algorithmic system of software to be able to get viewers in front of the videos that they might want to watch. And so this was a team that was effectively doing what we think of as an editorial role now of, like, managing a website homepage like The New York Times - and an integral part. They were one of the first people at YouTube to actually reach out to the people that were broadcasting and uploading videos and develop a relationship with. You know, at the time, it was sort of - if you were early on experimenting with YouTube, you didn't really have a connection. There wasn't a support line you could call or an email address - right? - to get in touch with the company. And so they were the first to build these relationships, which became very vital and then, you know, years later, as the platform grew, much more difficult to manage. DAVIES: Right. And, you know, they brought us Justin Bieber, right? He was discovered by them and promoted by YouTube and, boy, took off, right? BERGEN: Yeah. Well, actually, Bieber was incidentally - they found his video, and he was singing a cover. His mom was trying to get it on the YouTube homepage. Justin Bieber was discovered in 2008 by a record executive because of his popularity on YouTube, and his career launched from there. DAVIES: It's interesting to see, as this developed, what kinds of videos, you know, amateur videos really took off. One of them was box opening, people opening a box of a new product and people seeing it. And, you know, I thought we'd listen to a clip from one of the - this is kind of a youngster who was a star named Ryan Kaji. Am I saying that right? BERGEN: That's right. DAVIES: Yeah. He did box opening videos of toys that his parents submitted when - it started when he was just 3 years old. One of his - you can look it up. One of them has a billion views now. But this is an early one, an unboxing video where his mom takes him to Target, lets him pick out a toy, and he picks a LEGO train. And what we'll hear here is just a bit of this video of him opening the box with his mom's encouragement. (SOUNDBITE OF YOUTUBE VIDEO, \"KID PLAYING WITH TOYS LEGO DUPLO NUMBER TRAIN\")LOANN KAJI: Open it. RYAN KAJI: I see a yellow thing. KAJI: What yellow thing? Let's check it out. RYAN: A small yellow thing. It's - I see a white thing. KAJI: OK. Take it out. What white. . . RYAN: I think it's a dog. KAJI: Really? RYAN: Uh-huh. KAJI: Open it. Let's see. DAVIES: And that's it. I mean, adorable little kid, but - boy. What was the appeal of unboxing videos? BERGEN: Ryan is a really fascinating example. So he's gone on to have a tremendously successful career and effectively build an entire entertainment juggernaut around his YouTube channels. He - the one thing - he's very charismatic on screen. And it - I believe since he was 3 years old, he's been appearing in sort of a natural and, like, very comfortable in front of - and guileless in front of the camera. The unboxing videos actually began on YouTube with tech products, with iPhones. So the iPhone came out in 2007. A lot of the early reviewers would get these iPhones and these models before anyone else could have them. And it was this, you know, beyond just - if you want to leave a review of your phone, typically in a newspaper or blog, a video is a much more illustrative way to demonstrate, oh, here's this cool, new gadget. And so that was where they began. And I talked to some of the early YouTubers who had worked in that tech space, and they were like, well, we discovered when we were unboxing the videos, people actually wanted to watch them. They wanted to experience what it's like to take that new shiny product outside of a box. These were products that maybe they wanted, they aspired to purchase one day. And you saw that just transfer to toys around 2011, 2012. And toy unboxing as, like, a - as a psychological phenomenon, as a childhood development phenomenon is really under-examined. There are theories about sort of mirror neurons and what kind of fires off in our brain when we see someone perform an act that we want to do. And, you know, Ryan Kaji, in early - his early videos, he's not just playing with one toy, often it's dozens of toys. And this is something where kids clearly - there was an appeal to watching this. You know, he was also a really iconic example. He's Asian American. He's someone who didn't even attempt to go through, you know, conventional Hollywood or TV. This is something that YouTube prided itself on was it didn't have gatekeepers. There's no producer or agent that determines whether or not Ryan is popular. It is his mom uploading the videos and then viewers are watching. And that's part of YouTube's magic. DAVIES: Let's take a break here. Let me reintroduce you. We are speaking with Mark Bergen. He writes for Bloomberg and Bloomberg Businessweek. His new book is \"Like, Comment, Subscribe: Inside YouTube's Chaotic Rise To World Domination. \" We'll continue our conversation in just a moment. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF AMY RIGBY SONG, \"PLAYING PITTSBURGH\")DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. And our guest is Mark Bergen. He writes for Bloomberg and Bloomberg Businessweek. His new book about the video-sharing platform YouTube is \"Like, Comment, Subscribe: Inside YouTube's Chaotic Rise To World Domination. \" YouTube was founded in 2005 by three guys, mostly refugees from PayPal. Then Google acquired the company in 2006 for $1. 65 billion. They had not turned a profit yet, right? Why did Google do this? BERGEN: I think one major reason is that YouTube was also a very powerful, even then, search service. It was YouTube - Google is a search company. And it is definitely the world's biggest search engine. That is how the company thinks of itself, as sort of - it wants to be the primary place where people are searching on the internet. And they saw YouTube as this viable threat not just of, oh, here's this new phenomenon of online video. And Google was well aware that video was coming to the internet. But here is this powerful search engine that people are going on and looking not just for funny, amusing cat videos, but instructions, how-to videos, looking for commercial - like, looking up things about - you know, things they might want to buy and purchase. So that was a major reason why YouTube was attractive to Google. Google actually at the time had a competing service called Google Video that, for a variety of reasons, struggled to compete with YouTube. There's sort of a saying in Silicon Valley, you either build it or you buy it. DAVIES: (Laughter). BERGEN: And Google had just gone public in 2004, was flush with cash from its search advertising business, and so went out and bought it. And 1. 6 billion at that time was an eye-popping number, you know? Years later, Facebook would go out and buy a company like WhatsApp for almost 20 billion. So you know, I think history can look back and see, certainly financially, it was an incredibly savvy purchase for Google. DAVIES: So they figured out a way to put ads on videos and eventually started paying the creators, right? BERGEN: Yes. YouTube was actually remarkably early in that. 2007 is when they started sharing out revenue with broadcasters and in a small group - at that point, around 30 or so popular channels. Fast-forward to about 2011, 2012, YouTube decides this is something where we want to - you know, the company sort of really believes and they have this expression I talk about in the book, like, a level playing field. They saw themselves as a democratizing force in the world, right? You're going to put someone, an amateur, on the same level as a cable news host, right? Or someone who's making how-to beauty, make-up videos, you're going to be just as important as a fashion star. And the Arab Spring was around this time, right? Like, this was - YouTube was sort of documenting revolutions in a way that cable and television was not. And so they opened up the platform to not just have anyone broadcast themselves, but to make money from the commercials that run on and before the videos. DAVIES: In deciding what videos to promote, they used to have this group of people that they called the cool hunters that would look for video content to see what was going to display on the homepage. But eventually, they began to rely more and more on math, on algorithms - right? - to decide what would come up next. And they develop a system for recommending videos. If you watched a video, the algorithm would decide what to offer to you next. What was the idea here? BERGEN: The idea was to drive people to the videos that they wanted to see. I think this was a - at the time, YouTube was kind of struggling with what we would call clickbait, right? Sometimes they were - the videos would draw in viewers with an alluring title or the thumbnail - like, the still image on the homepage. People would click in and then immediately leave, be disappointed by what they were getting. Sometimes they were deceptive titles. And so the struggle for the - YouTube with its algorithms early on was, how are we going to tailor a video that's just made for you and continue - like, keeps you engaged, watching through the entire video and clicking more? And so they made this very significant change in 2012 to switch their ranking system for recommendations and for search to prioritize videos that can keep people on - watching for as long as possible. It's called watch time. And that became the kind of gold standard for the company going forward. DAVIES: Right. And of course, one of the things that this led to - and this has drawn a lot of criticism - is that if you - you know, if you watch a video about some interest of yours, you're going to get - and you finish it, then you're going to get another video about that interest. And that's - you know, if it's chess or gardening, that's all benign and fine. If you've taken an interest in some conspiratorial theory about how the election was stolen - and you watch that, and maybe you're a little curious, maybe a little skeptical. But then you get another one which reinforces it and maybe is a little more extreme. And then you get another one and another one. Over time, you think, gosh, this must be true. So many people believe this. Look at all this evidence. You write about somebody within Google, a guy named Matthew Mengerink, who raised concerns that people were simply having their own beliefs reinforced and particularly if they were, you know, racist or, you know, homophobic or, you know, based on some conspiracy theory that this was troubling. He raised this within the company. What did the company - how did they respond? BERGEN: Yeah. This was a concern - and he joined in 2015 - that people were starting to see. And I think two things were happening. One was that YouTube's algorithm had become exceptionally good and also a bit opaque, just the way that the machine learning system worked. It was sort of hard - the idea was that the software could sort of identify patterns that even the people coding it couldn't see. And it became very powerful in optimizing towards their goal and getting people to watch more and watch longer. So he was one of several people in the company that I spoke to that raised concerns. And the chief one was, you know, we are - there are videos that don't necessarily break our rules. YouTube did have rules in place about hate speech and harassment. They were relatively lax. And the company has changed them dramatically since 2015. But at the time, you know, it was if you were - a lot of YouTube creators kind of learned to go right up to the line. And the argument was - from several people was, why don't we not recommend that to viewers? - because I think people inside the company recognized that, in a way, YouTube was programming - although they don't see themselves as a traditional media programmer. But their algorithms are programming by the way that they recommend viewers footage. This was met with a couple of different concerns that I've heard from multiple people that raised this over the time. One was a legal concern. So, you know, YouTube has certain protections that - I mean, it's not liable for the content because it - under U. S. law and elsewhere. And the company was incredibly cautious about anything that could change that liability. The second one is just sort of YouTube and its parent company, Google, has this very strong belief that - the audience is king was the expression inside YouTube. They sort of believe that, oh, the audience was the one dictating what to watch and what's popular. And we don't - here sitting in Northern California with our biases, we don't want to put our thumb on the scale in any way. And so it was sort of - it was the response was actually, this proposal is un-Googley (ph). DAVIES: Wow. You know, it's interesting because, I mean, it would be one thing if you were, like, censoring or deleting videos that you disagreed with. But what we're really talking about here is what gets recommended to somebody after they've finished a video. And so that's - it's a matter of discretion. And at one point, I think somebody was talking about, well, maybe if someone, you know, says things that are racist or questioning the Holocaust, that maybe the next video is one which offers some historical context from an authoritative source. Was it felt that that's violating the verdict of audience approval or something? BERGEN: My understanding is that, you know, YouTube tries to - there's an expression that they have, which is they - like, everything they do has to be at scale, which effectively means, like, every decision they make has to work consistently for every viewer and for every creator across the globe. And so, you know, YouTube is not just in English, right? It is in sort of every language. It is in every market. And so there are certainly high-profile cases like Holocaust denial, which for a long time was permitted on the platform and no longer is. But there are also - like, another example would be in India about conversations about caste. And I think the company was very reluctant to sort of weigh in, how are we - you know, not how do we determine basically where to draw a line there as far as what's permitted, but then - that's difficult. But then how do we even - we don't want to necessarily suggest particular videos and impose our philosophy. That - I think that the idea was that there was - this is a big platform. We have drawn lines in the sand in certain places as far as what's acceptable legally and what's acceptable according to our community standards. And anything else felt sort of interventionist in a way that the company for a long time avoided doing until they were forced to do so. DAVIES: We need to take another break here. Let me reintroduce you. We are speaking with Mark Bergen. He writes for Bloomberg and Bloomberg Businessweek. His new book is \"Like, Comment, Subscribe: Inside YouTube's Chaotic Rise To World Domination. \" He'll be back to talk more after a short break. I'm Dave Davies, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF BANDA DE LOS MUERTOS' \"CUMBIA DE JACOBO\")DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies, in for Terry Gross. We're speaking with Mark Bergen, who's covered business, media and technology for years and now writes for Bloomberg and Bloomberg Businessweek. His new book is a colorful history of YouTube, the video-sharing platform that's now so large it uploads about 500 hours of new video per minute. He profiled some of YouTube's homegrown stars and explores the tension between the company's financial interest in promoting viral content and the harm that can come from posting videos that promote hatred or propagate misinformation. Bergen's book is \"Like, Comment, Subscribe: Inside YouTube's Chaotic Rise To World Domination. \"You know, one of the things that happens when you run a video-sharing service the size of YouTube's is that you can't possibly kind of, you know, curate it all individually. And so they rely on mathematical algorithms to do so much of the work, to filter out, you know, pornography and things like that. And often what will happen is that they will, you know, make a tweak or something, and then it'll change things and affect users and creators. And I thought we would listen to a clip here. This is from another huge YouTube star, a guy who goes by the name of PewDiePie. He's actually a Swedish guy named Felix Kjellberg, right? Got his start by videos of him just playing video games and commenting on them. This is one a little later. I thought we would give a listen. This is PewDiePie airing some complaints about YouTube. (SOUNDBITE OF YOUTUBE VIDEO)PEWDIEPIE: Hey, YouTube. It's time for me to complain about YouTube again. I know. Can someone just stop YouTube from their self? I feel like YouTube is like a toddler playing with knives. And let's just take the knife away from that baby. Stop. Stop doing - stop. Now, if you don't know what I'm talking about - you probably don't know what I'm talking about because it doesn't affect you in any way possible. So literally, you can click away the video right now. I mean, no. It matters, damn it. I don't know if you noticed this. This has been a problem for a very long time. No. 1, YouTube unsubbing you from a channel, even though. . . DAVIES: That is PewDiePie, one of the best-known creators for YouTube. Our guest is Mark Bergen. His new book about YouTube is \"Like, Comment, Subscribe. \"You know, what he's referring to here, what he's talking about YouTube unsubbing you is that he is saying it unsubscribes someone, you know, arbitrarily from a channel that they're subscribed to. And I guess what he's getting at is the fact that YouTube would make changes unannounced in its algorithm, which would really affect content creators, right? BERGEN: Oh, absolutely. Yeah. This happened throughout the history of YouTube, right? The ground is constantly shifting beneath the feet of even - so at this point, PewDiePie was the biggest star on the platform and had been for several years. He had more subscribers than any other channel. And that's, like, sort of the currency on YouTube and certain was earning millions. And there was this crunch around 2015 and 2016 that a lot of YouTube creators felt. And so this was actually a glitch the company had where - around a subscriber feature. And in my reporting, I find out that the company just didn't tell - didn't communicate with creators about this. They've made fairly significant strides in communicating with their creator class. But it still remains - you know, there are over 2 million people right now with channels that YouTube shares ad revenue with, which is this - it's a sprawling kind of gig economy of people that make money from YouTube but don't work for the company, don't have any health care from the company - right? - and don't have any guarantees. And often the only communication they'll get is an automated email. DAVIES: Wow. Let's just reemphasize that - 2 million people are creating content and have channels on YouTube. And some have made millions; others struggle. I mean - and I guess we should explain the kind of the undergirding principle here, which is that if advertisers put advertising on the videos that you submit, you keep 55% of the ad revenue and YouTube keeps 45%. Is that right? BERGEN: Yeah, that's right. That's right. Which is, you know - no company has been able to replicate that. They're - so Hank and John Green have been - are very popular YouTubers who have been on since 2007. John Green is also a prolific young adult book author. And they've talked about this a lot recently because, you know, TikTok is now starting to pay creators in a slightly different way. And, you know, Hank and John are among many creators that say that, you know, YouTube is still the place, still the gold standard where you can actually make dependable income and have - build a career and a business off of. And I think that's pretty remarkable that that clearly has had a lot of bumps in the past 17 years, but, you know, there are certainly a lot of companies trying to chase that right now. DAVIES: Right. And there are times when like, you know, YouTube adjusts its algorithm to filter out pornography, and suddenly people who have bodybuilding videos are cut off, right? And these things happen a lot. And it has sometimes catastrophic effects on people who are counting on this for a living. BERGEN: It had a very catastrophic effect on the company. One chapter in the book talks about this tragedy where a disgruntled YouTuber - shortly after YouTube made a change to make it harder to make money online, a very troubled woman brought a gun to its campus in San Bruno, Calif. Thankfully, no one was killed but the shooter. So this - for people at YouTube, that was clearly a moment when they, you know, they realized, and I think what separates YouTube from a lot of its peers is, you know, every decision they make not only impacts you and me as a viewer, but it impacts literally millions of people whose livelihoods are often reliant on this company and platform and the decisions it makes. DAVIES: So you can - you know, you can have your channel limited in a way for something you don't understand. You write that that many creators complained - that is to say, many people who create content for YouTube complained of burnout from the platform's unending demands. And that's kind of sounds confusing if, in fact, you know, the deal is you can upload whatever you want to. What are the demands? What are we talking about? BERGEN: Yeah, it's really interesting that, you know, people at YouTube talk about this as sort of - in television, there's a set schedule. I know that I'm on a TV shoot for a certain number of months and then I'm off, right? Or a movie - you're working on a movie for a set number of months. YouTube doesn't have that, right? The cadence and the expectation is constant, right? And this is like - it is very profound in part because it's kind of unspoken. Like, there was no one at YouTube telling creators, you must publish every single video every single day. And in fact, YouTube's more recently told them, you can, you know, look at our data. If you take a break, it doesn't actually harm your audience. But there are certainly - you know, a lot of the most successful YouTubers are incredibly astute and study the - they study the numbers. They study their - the metrics. And they can see that, you know, people that tend to produce on a more regular output tend to get a better chance of being distributed, have better audience - right? - have better financial success. And that has had led - and I talk about - there's one creator that I talk about in the book, Ingrid Nilsen, who was a star, early star, in the beauty category and really a trailblazer in this industry. And this sort of creative - it's both kind of creative and informative, and it transformed the fashion industry. She left YouTube after about a decade. And it's - there's been several largely women that have left in part just because it doesn't - you know, it's a profession without a clear end path. And it's one that, you know, there's this constant need to be continuing to grow and continuing to produce. DAVIES: You know, Ingrid Nilsen is one who - she made a lot of money on this. And the weird thing about this is that the notion that you have to produce content very frequently seems at odds to me with the idea that you need to make content that's really arresting to watch. I mean, I would think if you take a little more time, you get something that people are willing to stick with. I mean, I looked at an Ingrid Nilsen video where she takes a shower. She has a bathing suit on, so it's not - you know, nothing inappropriate. But she's explaining what she does when she washes her hair. And she has this product and then she starts, you know, massaging at the top and lets it go down and then she has this conditioner. And kind of amazing to me that that would get a huge following, but it does, doesn't it? BERGEN: There's something that - a term in academia - and forgive me for this - but parasocial network is sort of I think what you can call YouTube. And the idea is that there are people who watch these creators and influencers and feels that they know them personally, despite never having met them and not knowing them personally. And that's a profound, just, relationship that I think is not really understood. And it - YouTube was the - set the course. That was sort of the first major social media platform to do so. And now a lot of our social - the direction of social media is moving in that way. I mean, if people use Instagram, you realize that it's less and less of your friends and acquaintances and family and more of, say, an influencer you've never met who makes a compelling video. And that is the way that a lot of these tech platforms are moving. It is - it's an emotional burden - I talked to creators - to constantly perform a life on screen. DAVIES: Mark Bergen, thanks so much for speaking with us. BERGEN: Thanks for having me. It's been a pleasure. DAVIES: Mark Bergen writes for Bloomberg and Bloomberg Businessweek. His new book is \"Like, Comment, Subscribe: Inside YouTube's Chaotic Rise To World Domination. \" Coming up, Kevin Whitehead tells us about some musicians from the '70s that combined free jazz and electric funk and are at it again with a new album. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF DICE RAW SONG, \"PREGUNTA\") DAVE DAVIES, HOST:   This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies, in for Terry Gross. When congressional leaders grilled social media executives last year about spreading misinformation on the 2020 election and COVID-19, most of the heat was on Facebook, Twitter and the search engine Google. Our guest, business writer Mark Bergen, says far less attention is focused on YouTube, the video-sharing platform, which last year earned $28 billion in ad revenue and which has over 2 billion viewers around the world. Bergen's new book tells the story of YouTube's founding in 2005 on the simple idea of letting everyone share videos on the internet for free, and he describes the company's chaotic growth into a business giant. It's a platform that's allowed a 9-year-old boy whose videos began appearing when he was 3 to become a multimillionaire with his own toy and clothing brands. It's also given enormous exposure to Alex Jones and other conspiracy theorists. Bergen writes that YouTube has ushered in a world of abundant content and creativity of influencers and online hustlers, of information overload and endless culture wars. Mark Bergen writes for Bloomberg and Bloomberg Businessweek and previously reported on technology and media for Recode and Ad Age. He covered business and economics from India writing for The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and other publications. His new book is \"Like, Comment, Subscribe: Inside YouTube's Chaotic Rise To World Domination. \" Mark Bergen, welcome to FRESH AIR. Let's begin with YouTube's origin. In 2005, this was when there were hundreds of internet startups spawning everywhere, and most didn't take off. Tell us about the founding of YouTube, what its originators wanted to do. MARK BERGEN: Yeah, this was a wave, a revolutionary wave of what we call user-generated content on the internet - so not just websites where people would go and scroll and read, but they could actually participate. And so you had Blogger around that same time, Flickr, the photo-sharing app. Facebook was formed in 2004. And then, months later, there were three friends who had worked at PayPal that had got together. They had this idea. They wanted to do something on video. Video flip cameras were just becoming popular. You know, video was beginning to appear on the internet. But it was still very difficult to share and expensive and cumbersome. And so they - in early 2005, they began working on this site. There wasn't a lot of clarity in the sense that people would be posting amateur content or homemade videos, let alone that users and viewers would want to watch that. So they really stumbled upon this success by building a service that was pretty simple to use. Early on, it had that, you know, iconic triangular play button. It was able to embed in different websites. And once it took off with a lot of early creators - what we call now creators experimenting with it, it really hasn't slowed down since. DAVIES: Yeah, it's kind of remarkable. I mean, the idea is - I mean, the slogan was, broadcast yourself. Anybody could upload anything for free, right? BERGEN: Yeah. I think this was still a pretty novel idea and part of this Silicon Valley firm belief that information should be free and be accessible, and broadcast and video should be free and accessible and eventually will be. And YouTube was one of many, but it certainly became the - early on, leapfrogged around its competitors in part because it was so accessible and easy to use. You know, the founders talked about it in emails. This is something that they talked about how their mom should be able to use. And I think, to their credit, that's one of the reasons for its success. DAVIES: Right. So anybody could post anything. And who knew that, like, amateur videos would get an audience? But one of the things that they did early on was they knew that they wanted to find high-quality stuff and promote it. And so they created a group of people they called coolhunters. What was their mission? BERGEN: So at one point, there was a team of - they called themselves community managers. They sometimes called themselves editors. And they would pick the videos that would appear on the homepage. And they had different categories like sports and music and comedy. And some of that was sort of tapping into these early viral video hits. And they were also, like, sifting through. You know, one of them compared it to, like, looking through a record bin - right? - trying to go back and find these hidden gems because this is when YouTube was starting to get this influx of material from all around the world, and they hadn't built this algorithmic system of software to be able to get viewers in front of the videos that they might want to watch. And so this was a team that was effectively doing what we think of as an editorial role now of, like, managing a website homepage like The New York Times - and an integral part. They were one of the first people at YouTube to actually reach out to the people that were broadcasting and uploading videos and develop a relationship with. You know, at the time, it was sort of - if you were early on experimenting with YouTube, you didn't really have a connection. There wasn't a support line you could call or an email address - right? - to get in touch with the company. And so they were the first to build these relationships, which became very vital and then, you know, years later, as the platform grew, much more difficult to manage. DAVIES: Right. And, you know, they brought us Justin Bieber, right? He was discovered by them and promoted by YouTube and, boy, took off, right? BERGEN: Yeah. Well, actually, Bieber was incidentally - they found his video, and he was singing a cover. His mom was trying to get it on the YouTube homepage. Justin Bieber was discovered in 2008 by a record executive because of his popularity on YouTube, and his career launched from there. DAVIES: It's interesting to see, as this developed, what kinds of videos, you know, amateur videos really took off. One of them was box opening, people opening a box of a new product and people seeing it. And, you know, I thought we'd listen to a clip from one of the - this is kind of a youngster who was a star named Ryan Kaji. Am I saying that right? BERGEN: That's right. DAVIES: Yeah. He did box opening videos of toys that his parents submitted when - it started when he was just 3 years old. One of his - you can look it up. One of them has a billion views now. But this is an early one, an unboxing video where his mom takes him to Target, lets him pick out a toy, and he picks a LEGO train. And what we'll hear here is just a bit of this video of him opening the box with his mom's encouragement. (SOUNDBITE OF YOUTUBE VIDEO, \"KID PLAYING WITH TOYS LEGO DUPLO NUMBER TRAIN\") LOANN KAJI: Open it. RYAN KAJI: I see a yellow thing. KAJI: What yellow thing? Let's check it out. RYAN: A small yellow thing. It's - I see a white thing. KAJI: OK. Take it out. What white. . . RYAN: I think it's a dog. KAJI: Really? RYAN: Uh-huh. KAJI: Open it. Let's see. DAVIES: And that's it. I mean, adorable little kid, but - boy. What was the appeal of unboxing videos? BERGEN: Ryan is a really fascinating example. So he's gone on to have a tremendously successful career and effectively build an entire entertainment juggernaut around his YouTube channels. He - the one thing - he's very charismatic on screen. And it - I believe since he was 3 years old, he's been appearing in sort of a natural and, like, very comfortable in front of - and guileless in front of the camera. The unboxing videos actually began on YouTube with tech products, with iPhones. So the iPhone came out in 2007. A lot of the early reviewers would get these iPhones and these models before anyone else could have them. And it was this, you know, beyond just - if you want to leave a review of your phone, typically in a newspaper or blog, a video is a much more illustrative way to demonstrate, oh, here's this cool, new gadget. And so that was where they began. And I talked to some of the early YouTubers who had worked in that tech space, and they were like, well, we discovered when we were unboxing the videos, people actually wanted to watch them. They wanted to experience what it's like to take that new shiny product outside of a box. These were products that maybe they wanted, they aspired to purchase one day. And you saw that just transfer to toys around 2011, 2012. And toy unboxing as, like, a - as a psychological phenomenon, as a childhood development phenomenon is really under-examined. There are theories about sort of mirror neurons and what kind of fires off in our brain when we see someone perform an act that we want to do. And, you know, Ryan Kaji, in early - his early videos, he's not just playing with one toy, often it's dozens of toys. And this is something where kids clearly - there was an appeal to watching this. You know, he was also a really iconic example. He's Asian American. He's someone who didn't even attempt to go through, you know, conventional Hollywood or TV. This is something that YouTube prided itself on was it didn't have gatekeepers. There's no producer or agent that determines whether or not Ryan is popular. It is his mom uploading the videos and then viewers are watching. And that's part of YouTube's magic. DAVIES: Let's take a break here. Let me reintroduce you. We are speaking with Mark Bergen. He writes for Bloomberg and Bloomberg Businessweek. His new book is \"Like, Comment, Subscribe: Inside YouTube's Chaotic Rise To World Domination. \" We'll continue our conversation in just a moment.

His new book about the video-sharing platform YouTube is \"Like, Comment, Subscribe: Inside YouTube's Chaotic Rise To World Domination. \" YouTube was founded in 2005 by three guys, mostly refugees from PayPal. Then Google acquired the company in 2006 for $1. 65 billion. They had not turned a profit yet, right? Why did Google do this? BERGEN: I think one major reason is that YouTube was also a very powerful, even then, search service. It was YouTube - Google is a search company. And it is definitely the world's biggest search engine. That is how the company thinks of itself, as sort of - it wants to be the primary place where people are searching on the internet. And they saw YouTube as this viable threat not just of, oh, here's this new phenomenon of online video. And Google was well aware that video was coming to the internet. But here is this powerful search engine that people are going on and looking not just for funny, amusing cat videos, but instructions, how-to videos, looking for commercial - like, looking up things about - you know, things they might want to buy and purchase. So that was a major reason why YouTube was attractive to Google. Google actually at the time had a competing service called Google Video that, for a variety of reasons, struggled to compete with YouTube. There's sort of a saying in Silicon Valley, you either build it or you buy it. DAVIES: (Laughter). BERGEN: And Google had just gone public in 2004, was flush with cash from its search advertising business, and so went out and bought it. And 1. 6 billion at that time was an eye-popping number, you know? Years later, Facebook would go out and buy a company like WhatsApp for almost 20 billion. So you know, I think history can look back and see, certainly financially, it was an incredibly savvy purchase for Google. DAVIES: So they figured out a way to put ads on videos and eventually started paying the creators, right? BERGEN: Yes. YouTube was actually remarkably early in that. 2007 is when they started sharing out revenue with broadcasters and in a small group - at that point, around 30 or so popular channels. Fast-forward to about 2011, 2012, YouTube decides this is something where we want to - you know, the company sort of really believes and they have this expression I talk about in the book, like, a level playing field. They saw themselves as a democratizing force in the world, right? You're going to put someone, an amateur, on the same level as a cable news host, right? Or someone who's making how-to beauty, make-up videos, you're going to be just as important as a fashion star. And the Arab Spring was around this time, right? Like, this was - YouTube was sort of documenting revolutions in a way that cable and television was not. And so they opened up the platform to not just have anyone broadcast themselves, but to make money from the commercials that run on and before the videos. DAVIES: In deciding what videos to promote, they used to have this group of people that they called the cool hunters that would look for video content to see what was going to display on the homepage. But eventually, they began to rely more and more on math, on algorithms - right? - to decide what would come up next. And they develop a system for recommending videos. If you watched a video, the algorithm would decide what to offer to you next. What was the idea here? BERGEN: The idea was to drive people to the videos that they wanted to see. I think this was a - at the time, YouTube was kind of struggling with what we would call clickbait, right? Sometimes they were - the videos would draw in viewers with an alluring title or the thumbnail - like, the still image on the homepage. People would click in and then immediately leave, be disappointed by what they were getting. Sometimes they were deceptive titles. And so the struggle for the - YouTube with its algorithms early on was, how are we going to tailor a video that's just made for you and continue - like, keeps you engaged, watching through the entire video and clicking more? And so they made this very significant change in 2012 to switch their ranking system for recommendations and for search to prioritize videos that can keep people on - watching for as long as possible. It's called watch time. And that became the kind of gold standard for the company going forward. DAVIES: Right. And of course, one of the things that this led to - and this has drawn a lot of criticism - is that if you - you know, if you watch a video about some interest of yours, you're going to get - and you finish it, then you're going to get another video about that interest. And that's - you know, if it's chess or gardening, that's all benign and fine. If you've taken an interest in some conspiratorial theory about how the election was stolen - and you watch that, and maybe you're a little curious, maybe a little skeptical. But then you get another one which reinforces it and maybe is a little more extreme. And then you get another one and another one. Over time, you think, gosh, this must be true. So many people believe this. Look at all this evidence. You write about somebody within Google, a guy named Matthew Mengerink, who raised concerns that people were simply having their own beliefs reinforced and particularly if they were, you know, racist or, you know, homophobic or, you know, based on some conspiracy theory that this was troubling. He raised this within the company. What did the company - how did they respond? BERGEN: Yeah. This was a concern - and he joined in 2015 - that people were starting to see. And I think two things were happening. One was that YouTube's algorithm had become exceptionally good and also a bit opaque, just the way that the machine learning system worked. It was sort of hard - the idea was that the software could sort of identify patterns that even the people coding it couldn't see. And it became very powerful in optimizing towards their goal and getting people to watch more and watch longer. So he was one of several people in the company that I spoke to that raised concerns. And the chief one was, you know, we are - there are videos that don't necessarily break our rules. YouTube did have rules in place about hate speech and harassment. They were relatively lax. And the company has changed them dramatically since 2015. But at the time, you know, it was if you were - a lot of YouTube creators kind of learned to go right up to the line. And the argument was - from several people was, why don't we not recommend that to viewers? - because I think people inside the company recognized that, in a way, YouTube was programming - although they don't see themselves as a traditional media programmer. But their algorithms are programming by the way that they recommend viewers footage. This was met with a couple of different concerns that I've heard from multiple people that raised this over the time. One was a legal concern. So, you know, YouTube has certain protections that - I mean, it's not liable for the content because it - under U. S. law and elsewhere. And the company was incredibly cautious about anything that could change that liability. The second one is just sort of YouTube and its parent company, Google, has this very strong belief that - the audience is king was the expression inside YouTube. They sort of believe that, oh, the audience was the one dictating what to watch and what's popular. And we don't - here sitting in Northern California with our biases, we don't want to put our thumb on the scale in any way. And so it was sort of - it was the response was actually, this proposal is un-Googley (ph). DAVIES: Wow. You know, it's interesting because, I mean, it would be one thing if you were, like, censoring or deleting videos that you disagreed with. But what we're really talking about here is what gets recommended to somebody after they've finished a video. And so that's - it's a matter of discretion. And at one point, I think somebody was talking about, well, maybe if someone, you know, says things that are racist or questioning the Holocaust, that maybe the next video is one which offers some historical context from an authoritative source. Was it felt that that's violating the verdict of audience approval or something? BERGEN: My understanding is that, you know, YouTube tries to - there's an expression that they have, which is they - like, everything they do has to be at scale, which effectively means, like, every decision they make has to work consistently for every viewer and for every creator across the globe. And so, you know, YouTube is not just in English, right? It is in sort of every language. It is in every market. And so there are certainly high-profile cases like Holocaust denial, which for a long time was permitted on the platform and no longer is. But there are also - like, another example would be in India about conversations about caste. And I think the company was very reluctant to sort of weigh in, how are we - you know, not how do we determine basically where to draw a line there as far as what's permitted, but then - that's difficult. But then how do we even - we don't want to necessarily suggest particular videos and impose our philosophy. That - I think that the idea was that there was - this is a big platform. We have drawn lines in the sand in certain places as far as what's acceptable legally and what's acceptable according to our community standards. And anything else felt sort of interventionist in a way that the company for a long time avoided doing until they were forced to do so. DAVIES: We need to take another break here. Let me reintroduce you. We are speaking with Mark Bergen. He writes for Bloomberg and Bloomberg Businessweek. His new book is \"Like, Comment, Subscribe: Inside YouTube's Chaotic Rise To World Domination. \" He'll be back to talk more after a short break. I'm Dave Davies, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF BANDA DE LOS MUERTOS' \"CUMBIA DE JACOBO\") DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies, in for Terry Gross. We're speaking with Mark Bergen, who's covered business, media and technology for years and now writes for Bloomberg and Bloomberg Businessweek. His new book is a colorful history of YouTube, the video-sharing platform that's now so large it uploads about 500 hours of new video per minute. He profiled some of YouTube's homegrown stars and explores the tension between the company's financial interest in promoting viral content and the harm that can come from posting videos that promote hatred or propagate misinformation. Bergen's book is \"Like, Comment, Subscribe: Inside YouTube's Chaotic Rise To World Domination. \" You know, one of the things that happens when you run a video-sharing service the size of YouTube's is that you can't possibly kind of, you know, curate it all individually. And so they rely on mathematical algorithms to do so much of the work, to filter out, you know, pornography and things like that. And often what will happen is that they will, you know, make a tweak or something, and then it'll change things and affect users and creators. And I thought we would listen to a clip here. This is from another huge YouTube star, a guy who goes by the name of PewDiePie. He's actually a Swedish guy named Felix Kjellberg, right? Got his start by videos of him just playing video games and commenting on them. This is one a little later. I thought we would give a listen. This is PewDiePie airing some complaints about YouTube. (SOUNDBITE OF YOUTUBE VIDEO) PEWDIEPIE: Hey, YouTube. It's time for me to complain about YouTube again. I know. Can someone just stop YouTube from their self? I feel like YouTube is like a toddler playing with knives. And let's just take the knife away from that baby. Stop. Stop doing - stop. Now, if you don't know what I'm talking about - you probably don't know what I'm talking about because it doesn't affect you in any way possible. So literally, you can click away the video right now. I mean, no. It matters, damn it. I don't know if you noticed this. This has been a problem for a very long time. No. 1, YouTube unsubbing you from a channel, even though. . . DAVIES: That is PewDiePie, one of the best-known creators for YouTube. Our guest is Mark Bergen. His new book about YouTube is \"Like, Comment, Subscribe. \" You know, what he's referring to here, what he's talking about YouTube unsubbing you is that he is saying it unsubscribes someone, you know, arbitrarily from a channel that they're subscribed to. And I guess what he's getting at is the fact that YouTube would make changes unannounced in its algorithm, which would really affect content creators, right? BERGEN: Oh, absolutely. Yeah. This happened throughout the history of YouTube, right? The ground is constantly shifting beneath the feet of even - so at this point, PewDiePie was the biggest star on the platform and had been for several years. He had more subscribers than any other channel. And that's, like, sort of the currency on YouTube and certain was earning millions. And there was this crunch around 2015 and 2016 that a lot of YouTube creators felt. And so this was actually a glitch the company had where - around a subscriber feature. And in my reporting, I find out that the company just didn't tell - didn't communicate with creators about this. They've made fairly significant strides in communicating with their creator class. But it still remains - you know, there are over 2 million people right now with channels that YouTube shares ad revenue with, which is this - it's a sprawling kind of gig economy of people that make money from YouTube but don't work for the company, don't have any health care from the company - right? - and don't have any guarantees. And often the only communication they'll get is an automated email. DAVIES: Wow. Let's just reemphasize that - 2 million people are creating content and have channels on YouTube. And some have made millions; others struggle. I mean - and I guess we should explain the kind of the undergirding principle here, which is that if advertisers put advertising on the videos that you submit, you keep 55% of the ad revenue and YouTube keeps 45%. Is that right? BERGEN: Yeah, that's right. That's right. Which is, you know - no company has been able to replicate that. They're - so Hank and John Green have been - are very popular YouTubers who have been on since 2007. John Green is also a prolific young adult book author. And they've talked about this a lot recently because, you know, TikTok is now starting to pay creators in a slightly different way. And, you know, Hank and John are among many creators that say that, you know, YouTube is still the place, still the gold standard where you can actually make dependable income and have - build a career and a business off of. And I think that's pretty remarkable that that clearly has had a lot of bumps in the past 17 years, but, you know, there are certainly a lot of companies trying to chase that right now. DAVIES: Right. And there are times when like, you know, YouTube adjusts its algorithm to filter out pornography, and suddenly people who have bodybuilding videos are cut off, right? And these things happen a lot. And it has sometimes catastrophic effects on people who are counting on this for a living. BERGEN: It had a very catastrophic effect on the company. One chapter in the book talks about this tragedy where a disgruntled YouTuber - shortly after YouTube made a change to make it harder to make money online, a very troubled woman brought a gun to its campus in San Bruno, Calif. Thankfully, no one was killed but the shooter. So this - for people at YouTube, that was clearly a moment when they, you know, they realized, and I think what separates YouTube from a lot of its peers is, you know, every decision they make not only impacts you and me as a viewer, but it impacts literally millions of people whose livelihoods are often reliant on this company and platform and the decisions it makes. DAVIES: So you can - you know, you can have your channel limited in a way for something you don't understand. You write that that many creators complained - that is to say, many people who create content for YouTube complained of burnout from the platform's unending demands. And that's kind of sounds confusing if, in fact, you know, the deal is you can upload whatever you want to. What are the demands? What are we talking about? BERGEN: Yeah, it's really interesting that, you know, people at YouTube talk about this as sort of - in television, there's a set schedule. I know that I'm on a TV shoot for a certain number of months and then I'm off, right? Or a movie - you're working on a movie for a set number of months. YouTube doesn't have that, right? The cadence and the expectation is constant, right? And this is like - it is very profound in part because it's kind of unspoken. Like, there was no one at YouTube telling creators, you must publish every single video every single day. And in fact, YouTube's more recently told them, you can, you know, look at our data. If you take a break, it doesn't actually harm your audience. But there are certainly - you know, a lot of the most successful YouTubers are incredibly astute and study the - they study the numbers. They study their - the metrics. And they can see that, you know, people that tend to produce on a more regular output tend to get a better chance of being distributed, have better audience - right? - have better financial success. And that has had led - and I talk about - there's one creator that I talk about in the book, Ingrid Nilsen, who was a star, early star, in the beauty category and really a trailblazer in this industry. And this sort of creative - it's both kind of creative and informative, and it transformed the fashion industry. She left YouTube after about a decade. And it's - there's been several largely women that have left in part just because it doesn't - you know, it's a profession without a clear end path. And it's one that, you know, there's this constant need to be continuing to grow and continuing to produce. DAVIES: You know, Ingrid Nilsen is one who - she made a lot of money on this. And the weird thing about this is that the notion that you have to produce content very frequently seems at odds to me with the idea that you need to make content that's really arresting to watch. I mean, I would think if you take a little more time, you get something that people are willing to stick with. I mean, I looked at an Ingrid Nilsen video where she takes a shower. She has a bathing suit on, so it's not - you know, nothing inappropriate. But she's explaining what she does when she washes her hair. And she has this product and then she starts, you know, massaging at the top and lets it go down and then she has this conditioner. And kind of amazing to me that that would get a huge following, but it does, doesn't it? BERGEN: There's something that - a term in academia - and forgive me for this - but parasocial network is sort of I think what you can call YouTube. And the idea is that there are people who watch these creators and influencers and feels that they know them personally, despite never having met them and not knowing them personally. And that's a profound, just, relationship that I think is not really understood. And it - YouTube was the - set the course. That was sort of the first major social media platform to do so. And now a lot of our social - the direction of social media is moving in that way. I mean, if people use Instagram, you realize that it's less and less of your friends and acquaintances and family and more of, say, an influencer you've never met who makes a compelling video. And that is the way that a lot of these tech platforms are moving. It is - it's an emotional burden - I talked to creators - to constantly perform a life on screen. DAVIES: Mark Bergen, thanks so much for speaking with us. BERGEN: Thanks for having me. It's been a pleasure. DAVIES: Mark Bergen writes for Bloomberg and Bloomberg Businessweek.

NPR's Shannon Bond joins us now. Shannon, OK, so what have we heard so far from the Big Tech platforms? SHANNON BOND, BYLINE: Well, on the whole, this is a pretty familiar playbook from 2020. So these companies are going to be boosting authoritative information from local election officials, reputable news outlets. So, for example, Facebook, Twitter and TikTok all have dedicated pages where you can find out who your local candidates are and how to vote. And then on the flip side, they are tamping down misleading or false claims about voting or posts that undermine confidence in the election, including the big lie that Donald Trump won in 2020. And so across these apps, especially Facebook and Twitter, we're going to see the return of labels on posts with misleading or false claims. In some cases, they don't let people share these posts to limit their reach. And then in some other cases, they'll even remove some of these claims. So YouTube says, you know, it's going to just take down videos that break its rules against making false claims about the results in 2020. And then finally, these apps are all taking different approaches to political ads. So Twitter and TikTok ban them entirely. Facebook allows them, but it's going to have a freeze on new political ads the week before Election Day. But, look, A, even defining political ads isn't that straightforward. You know, broadly, we're talking about ads for candidates and about political issues, but there is a lot of room to interpret what exactly that means. MART\u00cdNEZ: All right, Shannon, all this sounds just grand, but how effective is this? BOND: Well, that's the big question. And the short answer is, in many cases, we don't know. So take labels - right? - a big part of these policies. There's mixed evidence about whether labeling false claims helps dispel false impressions or if it, in some cases, actually encourages people to double down on these beliefs. Now, Twitter says it has redesigned its misleading information labels and found more people were clicking through to read accurate information. On the other hand, Facebook says it's going to be more choosy about, you know, what posts it chooses to label - says users felt it put too many labels on posts last time around. And then, crucially, we also don't know how well the companies actually enforce these policies. I spoke to Katie Harbath, a former public policy director at Facebook. KATIE HARBATH: To me, that is a huge gap that we don't talk enough about because the companies are like, these are our policies, these are all the things that we're going to do. But they don't talk enough about, like, OK, but, you know, humans are fallible. The technology is not a hundred percent perfect. BOND: So even if you do have the right policies in place and tools that work, are you using them effectively? So back in 2020, that didn't always seem to be the case, right? After the election, Stop the Steal groups popped up on Facebook, falsely claiming Trump had won. That was against Facebook's rules. Facebook removed the initial group, but it didn't take down other groups. Ultimately, that fueled the conspiracies that ended up with Trump supporters breaching the Capitol. MART\u00cdNEZ: Are there any signs that the platforms maybe have learned from what happened two years ago? BOND: Many researchers who study the platform say generally, these companies are just very reactive, right? They end up playing whack-a-mole with false claims. They treat elections as these discrete events that happen. They put policies in place, and then they turn off those policies when the election is over. But, look, this year, we have Republican candidates for office, even people who could be in charge of running elections in some states, still falsely claiming Trump won in 2020. So the big challenge for these companies is, can they prevent their platforms from being used to spread these kinds of falsehoods so widely in the first place? MART\u00cdNEZ: And just to note, Facebook's parent company, Meta, pays NPR to license NPR content. That's NPR's Shannon Bond. Shannon, thanks. BOND: Thank you.

So Karsten Muller and Carlo Schwarz decided to look closely at every anti-refugee attack across Germany from January 2015 to February 2017. It was thousands of cases in all. They analyzed the communities where the attacks took place using all kinds of variables trying to find a pattern. They looked at wealth, demographics, political leaning. Nothing stood out. And then, they hit on something. MAX FISHER: The places where Facebook usage - not general internet usage, but specifically Facebook usage - was significantly above the average for Germany, the number of attacks on refugees was also well above the average. SHAPIRO: That's author Max Fisher, who writes about this research in his new book, \"The Chaos Machine. \" It's not just that violence against refugees went up in places where people used Facebook a lot. The researchers also looked at outages - Facebook disruptions - and they found that when the platform went offline in a specific place, attacks against refugees in that community dropped. FISHER: Extended time on social media is addictive, and it changes your behavior, and it changes the way that your mind works. And it does that in a consistent direction towards more outrage, more extreme ideas and a greater hatred of us versus them. SHAPIRO: By now, we have evidence of this from all over the world. People have studied the role of social media in cases of ethnic violence and even genocide. In Myanmar, people used WhatsApp to organize massacres against Rohingya Muslims. And in the U. S. , January 6 insurrectionists have said that YouTube played a role in shaping their extremist ideas. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)FRANCES HAUGEN: My fear is that without action, divisive and extremist behaviors we see today are only the beginning. What we saw in Myanmar and are now seeing in Ethiopia are only the opening chapters of a story so terrifying no one wants to read the end of it. SHAPIRO: Frances Haugen was a data scientist at Facebook. And here we should mention that Facebook's parent company, Meta, pays NPR to license NPR content. Haugen testified before the Senate in October of last year, saying the company consistently valued profit and growth over protecting its users. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)HAUGEN: The result has been more division, more harm, more lies, more threats and more combat. In some cases, this dangerous online talk has led to actual violence that harms and even kills people. SHAPIRO: A former security chief for Twitter made similar accusations in a hearing before Congress just today. Disinformation on social media has been a huge problem in the U. S. as well as overseas. During the pandemic, Cincinnati pediatrician Nicole Baldwin said she saw people dying unnecessarily because of conspiracy theories they picked up online. NICOLE BALDWIN: I think the challenge is you can say almost anything that you want to say on social media. You can claim expertise in a field, whether or not you have it. And the algorithms on these channels push out content that people are looking at. So it's terrifying. It's frustrating. SHAPIRO: On almost every giant social media platform, algorithms push users to stay longer, getting sucked into echo chambers. And that drive to hold people's attention is something tech executives openly discuss. Here's how Jack Dorsey put it in a congressional hearing last year when he was head of Twitter. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JACK DORSEY: Ultimately, we're running a business. And a business wants to grow the number of customers it serves. SHAPIRO: All the biggest social media companies have been accused of sacrificing people's safety for profit. Tech executives often respond to the criticism in similar ways. They say people are responsible for their own actions. When members of Congress asked if Facebook bore some responsibility for the January 6 insurrection, here's how CEO Mark Zuckerberg replied. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MARK ZUCKERBERG: I think that the responsibility here lies with the people who took the actions to break the law and take - and do the insurrection. And secondarily, also the people who spread that content, with repeated rhetoric over time, saying that the election was rigged and encouraging people to organize, I think that those people bear the primary responsibility as well. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)SHAPIRO: CONSIDER THIS - social media is not only shaping our view of the world, it is shaping world events, and we're only beginning to fully understand how. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)SHAPIRO: From NPR, I'm Ari Shapiro. It's Tuesday, September 13. It's CONSIDER THIS FROM NPR. If you feel like checking social media leaves you angrier and more outraged, that's not your imagination. And reporter Max Fisher says the polarizing effect of social media is only speeding up. Here's how he explains it in his book, \"The Chaos Machine. \"FISHER: (Reading) Remember that the number of seconds in your day never changes. The amount of social media content competing for those seconds, however, doubles every year or so, depending on how you measure it. Imagine, for instance, that your network produces 200 posts a day, of which you have time to read about a hundred. Because of the platform's tilt, you will see the most outraged half of your feed. Next year, when 200 doubles to 400, you will see the most outraged quarter; the year after that, the most outraged eighth. Over time, your impression of your own community becomes radically more immoralizing, aggrandizing and outraged. And so do you. At the same time, less innately engaging forms of content - truth, appeals to the greater good, appeals to tolerance - become more and more outmatched, like stars over Times Square. SHAPIRO: Whether it's Facebook, YouTube or Twitter, artificial intelligence is deciding what to show us. When I talked with Fisher, I asked him, why is it that on the whole spectrum of things that algorithms on platforms could show us, the things they choose are outrageous and polarizing. FISHER: It's because those are the things that are most engaging to us because they speak to a sense of social compulsion, of a group identity that is under threat. Moral outrage, specifically, is probably the most powerful form of content because what you are experiencing is millions of years of evolution, the very specific environment that we, the human animal, evolved and had to learn to survive in, where you had to survive by finding a place and seeking the approval within this group, but also defending against outside groups. And no one in Silicon Valley deliberately decided to surface these, but they developed these systems that were just uncannily powerful at identifying what was going to be the thing that was going to hook us. And this just happened to be it. SHAPIRO: So you give lots of examples of how this played out. One specific one is about a goal that YouTube set - to get a billion hours of watch time per day by 2016. And you write that to reach this goal, YouTube basically brain hacked millions of Americans in the middle of the most contentious election in modern history. Spoiler - they got their goal. How did they achieve it? FISHER: So what the systems that govern YouTube and that govern what you see realized is that what would actually serve that goal is by providing you content that would create some sort of a sense that you and your identity were under threat. And so what that might mean is that if you're looking for, let's say health tips, let's say information about vaccines, the best thing for YouTube to show you isn't straightforward health information; the best thing for YouTube to show you is something that gives you a sense that you are part of some community, let's say moms who are concerned about their kids, and that that community is under threat from some outside danger and that that will trigger a sense of alarm that will make you want to come back and spend more and more time watching. SHAPIRO: So the key question isn't, what's the best information we can give the user; the key question is, what will keep the user's eyeballs glued to our platform? FISHER: And what's amazing is that if you go and look back at internal conversations within YouTube - and this is something they talked about openly at the time - is that they explicitly said, our goal should not be to surface the best information; our goal should be to surface content that is emotionally engaging, that will get people to spend more time on the platform. And they were saying this, like you said, right at the start of what would turn out to be arguably the most consequential election in American history. SHAPIRO: You did some reporting in Sri Lanka, where people used Facebook and WhatsApp, which is owned by the same company, to gin up ethnic violence. And high-ranking Sri Lankan officials begged Facebook to do something before violence broke out. And you write that every single report was ignored. And then, after mobs took to the streets, destroying homes and businesses, the government finally reluctantly blocked all access to social media. Will you read what happened next? FISHER: Yeah, sure. (Reading) Two things happened almost immediately. The violence stopped. Without Facebook or WhatsApp driving them, the mobs simply went home. And Facebook representatives, after months of ignoring government ministers, finally returned their calls; but not to ask about the violence. They wanted to know why traffic had zeroed out. SHAPIRO: I mean, what do you make of that? FISHER: So the thing about these companies is they do employ a lot of really smart, thoughtful people who are, within bounds, trying their best to limit the harms of these platforms. But these are. . . SHAPIRO: (Laughter) You're trying to spin this in the best possible light. It looks really bad. FISHER: It's - yeah. Well, but the thing is, is these people do not ultimately have the authority and the power within these companies. The people who have the authority and the power are - just like in any major corporation, are the profit drivers. And those are the people who get that traffic up so they can sell ads against it and continue to make billions and billions of dollars. And that is the thinking that prevails, in which Sri Lanka was a really striking case. If it's not even that valuable of a market, they don't even make that much money there. And the warnings that Facebook was getting ahead of this violence were so specific and from so many very senior people in government saying this is going to lead to an outbreak of a vicious, racial, religious mob violence, which is exactly what happened. And maybe somebody in the company did care, but not enough for any demonstrable changes to happen at the company. But as soon as the traffic dropped out, the company mobilized into action. And I think that this is an instructive story for what - behind all the rhetoric, behind all the high flying manifestos about how they're bringing us to a new stage of human evolution, what really drives and concerns these companies. SHAPIRO: In light of all this, how do you explain the millions of people who use social media every day and don't get radicalized or pulled into conspiracy theories or flame wars? FISHER: I think that's a really important question because for the overwhelming majority of us, the effect is subtle. Spending more time on social media will make you significantly more polarized. It will make you more prone to feeling - internally feeling in your own self outrage and moral outrage. And that is something that I think we do all feel and that might ring true to those of us who spend time on social media who don't become a crazy conspiracy theorist but will feel that pull on us. SHAPIRO: Let's talk about solutions. You believe that eliminating these companies altogether would create a lot of harm. So what do you think the solution is to these problems? Is there a way to change the model so companies are not so incentivized to feed people outrageous stuff that'll keep them glued to the platform for hours? FISHER: Whenever I would ask the experts who study this, you know, what do they think that the solution should be, it's always some version of turning it off; not turning off the entire platform, not shuttering the website, but turning off the algorithm, turning off likes, the little counter at the bottom of the post that shows you how many people liked it or retweeted it. That's something that even Jack Dorsey, the former head of Twitter, floated as an idea because he came to see that as so harmful. But turning off these engagement-maximizing features is something that we have actually experimented with. And a version of social media like that, I think, could potentially bring a lot of the good that they bring, which is real, and mitigate some of the harms.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PEITER ZATKO: The company's cybersecurity failures make it vulnerable to exploitation, causing real harm to real people. SUMMERS: That's Peiter Zatko, who was fired by Twitter in January. NPR Tech reporter Raquel Maria Dillon has been following the story. Hey there. RAQUEL MARIA DILLON, BYLINE: Hi. SUMMERS: Can you start off by explaining to us more about these foreign agents that Zatko says Twitter hires? DILLON: Well, Zatko described one case in which the Indian government coerced Twitter into hiring two of its agents. The company went along with it because it didn't want to lose access to such a large market. Zatko says that puts company systems at risk and also user information, which is a big deal because a lot of Indian activists go on Twitter to protest their government. Now, Zatko is not just some disgruntled worker. Twitter hired him in 2020 to shore up security there after a really big hack. And he is a big deal in the cybersecurity community, where people call him by his hacker handle, Mudge. He's worked with the Defense Department and made his name as a hacker way back in the '90s. SUMMERS: OK. So besides the foreign agents, did he say that Twitter had other security problems? DILLON: Yeah. Zatko says the company doesn't do a good job of controlling who inside Twitter has access to all of its data. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)ZATKO: You can think of it this way, which is it doesn't matter who has keys if you don't have any locks on the doors. DILLON: Twitter has lots of data. Nothing new there. Plenty of tech companies do have a lot of data on their users. But Zatko says Twitter is doing a uniquely bad job at keeping user data private. He says Twitter is a decade behind when it comes to basic security practices. And in the tech world, 10 years is a long time. He says the blame goes right to the top. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)ZATKO: Twitter leadership is misleading the public, lawmakers, regulators and even its own board of directors. DILLON: Zatko described the company as just moving from crisis to crisis because leaders don't stop to examine their systems or procedures or their company culture. SUMMERS: OK. That is a long list of accusations. Raquel, how is Twitter responding? DILLON: A spokesperson for Twitter says these allegations are riddled with inconsistencies and inaccuracies. The company also defended its hiring practices. Twitter's CEO was invited to testify today, but Iowa Republican Senator Chuck Grassley said he declined. Parag Agarwal says an appearance before the committee could have jeopardized the company's lawsuit against Elon Musk, Tesla's CEO. And Grassley would have none of that. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)CHARLES GRASSLEY: The business of this committee and protecting Americans from foreign influence is more important than Twitter's civil litigation in Delaware. If these allegations are true, I don't see how Mr. Agarwal can maintain his position at Twitter. DILLON: Agarwal is a pretty new CEO, but he's an insider. He was an engineer who worked his way to the top. Zatko says that means he should have known about all of this. When Zatko tried to raise these issues with him, he says he was ignored. SUMMERS: In the last 20 or so seconds we have left, there's that lawsuit that Twitter filed against Elon Musk. How does that play into all of this? DILLON: Zatko made it look like Twitter is not to be trusted. That case in Delaware has turned into a super complicated, knockdown, drag-out legal fight. And at issue is whether Musk has to buy Twitter for $44 billion, which is what he agreed to. After Zatko came forward with these allegations, Musk seized on them as another reason to get out of the deal. He's definitely watching because he tweeted today a movie popcorn emoji. SUMMERS: OK.

SUMMERS: In the last 20 or so seconds we have left, there's that lawsuit that Twitter filed against Elon Musk. How does that play into all of this? DILLON: Zatko made it look like Twitter is not to be trusted. That case in Delaware has turned into a super complicated, knockdown, drag-out legal fight. And at issue is whether Musk has to buy Twitter for $44 billion, which is what he agreed to. After Zatko came forward with these allegations, Musk seized on them as another reason to get out of the deal. He's definitely watching because he tweeted today a movie popcorn emoji. SUMMERS: OK. DILLON: He says he seems to be enjoying the show the Senate put on. SUMMERS: NPR's Raquel Maria Dillon, thank you.

S. -led NATO alliance operates on a paramount principle, an attack on one is considered an attack on all. When the United States was attacked on 9/11, the alliance invoked that principle. If Russian tanks were ever to roll into a NATO nation, the principle surely would apply again. But things get murkier when a NATO nation faces a cyberattack. NPR cybersecurity correspondent Jenna McLaughlin is covering this story. Good morning. JENNA MCLAUGHLIN, BYLINE: Good morning, Steve. INSKEEP: I guess we should just note, if you follow the news, you know that numerous NATO nations get cyberattacked. The U. S. has been cyberattacked. What's a recent example? MCLAUGHLIN: For sure. So one you might not have heard of but was really important was in Albania on July 15. The government was hit by a massive cyberattack. Now, many months later in September, Albania, alongside a whole bunch of independent researchers, concluded that it was Iran that was behind it. And that was based on forensics and because the attack was directed at a conference that was featuring some Iranian dissidents. So as a result, Albania actually decided to completely cut off diplomatic ties with Iran and kick all their diplomats out of the country, which was huge. That's actually never happened before. And actually, the latest is that it looks like there was another cyberattack on border crossing stations over the weekend in Albania. And they're also blaming Iran for that. INSKEEP: And I guess we should just remind people, Albania is part of the NATO alliance, which now includes more than two dozen nations across Europe. So even the U. S. is blaming Iran. What happens now? MCLAUGHLIN: Sure. So experts did agree that this was pretty huge and unprecedented. So it's a little hard to know. I imagine that part of the hope had been that cutting diplomatic ties would deter Iran from doing it again. But clearly, it's actually heating up. On the U. S. side, the White House did come out with some new sanctions on Iran's Ministry of Intelligence. And they've sent some teams to help out. INSKEEP: Is NATO getting involved or invoking its treaty provision that an attack on one is an attack on everyone? MCLAUGHLIN: So that is where things get interesting. And it's actually not just Albania that recently had a major cyberattack. We're also seeing Montenegro be hit by a ransomware attack. Criminal hackers demanded tens of millions to unlock government files. There's still a lot about this hack we don't know. There are U. S. teams on the ground in both of those places. So we have seen some NATO action to come and help and investigate and defend. NATO has condemned the attack. And it's in touch with those governments. But there hasn't been a team dispatched yet. INSKEEP: And I suppose NATO is not about to fire missiles at Iran or something? MCLAUGHLIN: Probably not. Like you said, Article 5 is - says that an attack on one is an attack on all. That doesn't automatically mean military action, though it could. But with cyberspace, I remember having conversations at the beginning of the war in Ukraine when the U. S. was warning that Russia might hit NATO allies with cyberattacks. Experts did say that it's not exactly clear that members would have to respond with additional cyberattacks or some kind of strong response like that. I spoke to John Hultquist about this. He's with the cyber firm Mandiant. Here's what he said. JOHN HULTQUIST: Cyberattacks live in a very interesting space because they're nonviolent. And because a lot of their effects are reversible, the actors who use them probably recognize that this may be a tool that they can use without necessarily launching some sort of Article 5 response. MCLAUGHLIN: Even so, cyberattacks are clearly more and more a part of modern warfare. If they get worse, we could see responses escalate as well. INSKEEP: Such as how? MCLAUGHLIN: So Biden has promised to use every tool to respond to Russia. The White House did quickly impose these sanctions. I think that they're always keeping their options open. And we'll have to see with Montenegro. But in the future, if an attack does lead to violence or permanent destruction on critical infrastructure, we could see an even stronger response.

I'm Manoush Zomorodi. And you may have heard of Zelig or Forrest Gump, a character who always seems to turn up at just the right time, in just the right place, smack dab at the center of all the action. Well, that is the best way to describe Stewart Brand. STEWART BRAND: Hi, Manoush. ZOMORODI: Hi, Stewart. Thank you so much for doing this. You may never have heard of him, but he has been right next to - even propelling - some of the biggest names and movements of the last century. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: And by the time all the rest of us get there, he's gone on to something else more interesting. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: He could see into the future that this technology was going to be a huge part of American culture. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: It isn't so much that he's ahead of it; he's actually creating the future. ZOMORODI: Brand is nearly 84 years old now, and we wanted to spend the hour with him looking back at how he shaped our culture through the years, like with his Whole Earth Catalog, a counterculture magazine that Steve Jobs once called Google in paperback form. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)STEVE JOBS: . . . Google in paperback form 35 years before Google came along. It was idealistic, overflowing with neat tools and great notions. ZOMORODI: Others credit Brand with helping kickstart the environmental movement in the U. S. and later turning the Bay Area into Silicon Valley, home to the world's most successful tech companies. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: In the beginning, the people who worked with computers were considered magicians. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #5: Abracadabra. ZOMORODI: His never-ending curiosity continues to this day. BRAND: And there's kind of a hunger and foolishness to it. It's appetite. It's willingness to be ridiculous on the way to something you think might be interesting. ZOMORODI: And over the last few years, Stewart Brand has taken on new, mind-bending projects, like working to bring back extinct animals like the woolly mammoth and building a clock to ring once a century and keep time for 10,000 years. BRAND: Humanity has revved itself into a pathologically short attention span and to not think about long ranges of time is, at best, a waste and, at worst, an extreme hazard. ZOMORODI: So today on the show, Stewart Brand, a conversation with a controversial cult figure who's always looking at where society is going next and has some big - some say crazy - ideas about where it should be going. Stewart, welcome to the TED RADIO HOUR. BRAND: Thank you. ZOMORODI: I want to start by asking you - you have lived an incredible life, but let's go back to the beginning. Tell us a bit about where you grew up, Rockford, Ill. Did you have visions of what you would be when you grew up? BRAND: Oh, yeah. I knew I was going to be a veterinarian. I was the guy that everybody brought injured or young, abandoned wild animals to, and I would try to raise them. ZOMORODI: Aw. And did your parents support that endeavor, or were they horrified? BRAND: Always supportive, actually, even of the nasty possum I had named Frank, who was - bad attitude. . . ZOMORODI: (Laughter). BRAND: . . . About everything. ZOMORODI: So in the late '50s, you went into the Army Reserve and to Stanford University, where I guess the veterinary dream continued because you majored in biology, and your thesis was about the lives of tarantulas. BRAND: Well, yeah, studying biology was - I majored in science partly to get away from the problem I saw in the humanities, which was that what was deemed good was based on a judgment call by the teacher or the, you know, section leader or something like that - you know, what they thought were the right ways to think about Shakespeare or whatever. And that kind of being driven by opinion was not the case with science, and there you had to actually deal with reality that often flew in the face of people's opinion. And I liked that. ZOMORODI: I mean, that's so interesting that you say that 'cause it sounds like you gravitated towards knowing what was right or fact or a binary. And I think of what happened next, which was that at the end of college, after you graduated, you started spending time in a very humanities, writerly, bohemian scene living in San Francisco. That seems like a change. What do you think happened there? BRAND: Well, I was moving toward where the creatives were. And, you know, there's creativity in science, and there's creativity in art. And they are drastically different in a lot of ways, but they're also drastically the same in a lot of ways. There's a kind of a criticism in my family among some folks in Rockford that brands are so contrary. If you throw one in the river, they'll float upstream. And. . ZOMORODI: (Laughter). BRAND: . . . Floating upstream, that is looking upstream and thinking upstream is what scientists do. You're always looking for discovery. It's what artists do. You don't want to repeat what any other artist is doing or even what you yourself used to be doing. And that was one of the things I picked up from the artists in the world around San Francisco's north beaches - never repeat yourself. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ZOMORODI: Yeah. So you got to San Francisco in the mid-'60s. And by this point, you were freelancing as a photographer, but you also started hanging out with Ken Kesey, who, of course, wrote \"One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest,\" one of my favorite books. And he had this legendary group of friends and comrades, and they called themselves the Merry Pranksters. And you ended up joining. This group traveled all over the U. S. in a psychedelic bus, renouncing normal society. They also did a fair amount of LSD. Just describe it. What was life like for you then? BRAND: Well, the attraction of the pranksters was they really did inhabit the raggedy edge. And Kesey and the whole group developed a fearlessness, a boldness that I found very attractive. It was the kind of thing that - a young person wants to go, you know, where it's dangerous. And that group definitely was where it was dangerous. It was dangerous in terms of the messing around with drugs we were doing. It was dangerous in terms of having Neal Cassady be the driver of the bus. ZOMORODI: And there was a lot going on in the country at that time. JFK had been assassinated. The civil rights movement was in full swing. And you found yourself kind of at the nexus of a huge culture shift that was happening all around the country. BRAND: That's right. It was mostly still new left at that point. It was - the Vietnam War was coming on, and people were getting worked up about that and organizing. There were hippies around, and we didn't know that there were 10,000 hippies in the Bay Area until I and Kesey and the Pranksters put on a thing called the Trips Festival in January of 1966, when LSD was still legal, by the way. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #6: The acid test is everywhere in this spaceship. Everywhere you are - you're all acid testing. BRAND: And it was a huge event, and it became kind of a watershed event. That's when hippies became aware there were so many of them, they were a movement. ZOMORODI: OK, so this was an event that you organized that wound up being one of the biggest festivals of the era. In fact, like, the Grateful Dead went big because of it. And some people say that the Trips Festival helped mark the beginning of the hippie counterculture movement. I mean, this must have been some party, Stewart. What do you remember of it, if anything? BRAND: Well, the - what we are attempting to do, and why we called it Trips Festival, was to find all the really interesting, creative people that we knew in the Bay Area and basically just have a show three nights at the Longshoremen's Hall in San Francisco, where everybody showed what they had. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)UNIDENTIFIED MUSICAL ARTIST: (Singing, inaudible). BRAND: There was - along with artists doing their thing, there was a sculptor named Ron Boise who made these enormous, noisy sculptures that you would bang on and pluck at strings and make sort of group music. It was sort of just the beginning of a kind of dancing that - I mean, I grew up doing the damn foxtrot. ZOMORODI: (Laughter). BRAND: And what I loved about the Bohemian world is dancing was just - go out in the middle of the floor, and carry on, with somebody or not, and disappear into the music and see what happens. When the bands were playing especially, it just became this huge bash, everybody on their feet dancing. And the kind of thing we see at Burning Man ever since, for example, is a direct result of people discovering how much fun you can have if you just threw yourself completely into being part of the performance. ZOMORODI: So it was a couple of months after the Trips Festival that you took LSD on your own and zeroed in on a provocative question, which was, why haven't people seen a photo of the Earth from space? Nowadays that would maybe be turned into an online conspiracy theory. But that's not what happened. What did happen? What did you do? BRAND: What was happening was I was reading and listening to Buckminster Fuller in those days, and he was focused on sort of world system thinking. And I was also a photographer, so I'm always thinking about, what are the images that change people's minds? And I was on the rooftop of my place in North Beach in San Francisco with, you know, probably a half-dose, quarter-dose of LSD, just watching the afternoon scintillate, and then pretended to myself that I can see the buildings downtown - the tall buildings were not exactly parallel. They diverged slightly because they were on the curved surface of the Earth. And then I imagined myself going to a higher and higher altitude, and that curve would extend and then close all the way around on itself. And you would have San Francisco as seen from space on the surface of the sphere. And that point, this is 10 years since Sputnik. And so it certainly seemed very strange to me that both the Soviet Union and the United States had been in space for - on the order of 10 years, and I could have taken serious photographs near Earth from space and apparently hadn't done so. And I just thought, well, as soon as that photograph happens, everything's going to change because I knew enough science to know that the way people thought the Earth looks from space was not the way it probably really looked. And the difference would blow their mind, in the parlance of the time. And a year or two later, that's exactly what happened. ZOMORODI: In a moment, Stewart Brand describes how seeing the Earth from space for the first time really did change how people thought about our place in the universe and why it inspired him to launch something called the Whole Earth Catalog. I'm Manoush Zomorodi, and you're listening to the TED Radio Hour from NPR. Stay with us. It's the TED RADIO HOUR from NPR. I'm Manoush Zomorodi. Today, we are talking to writer and futurist Stewart Brand, who helped usher in San Francisco's hippie counterculture in the 1960s. And as we heard before the break, Stewart got somewhat obsessed with wanting to see a picture of Earth from space. Now, remember, this was before the moon landing, when satellites and space travel were pretty new. And, Stewart, you became kind of an analog meme, I think it's fair to say, in some ways. You made this big sign, and you printed out a bunch of buttons that ask the question, why haven't we seen a photo of the Earth from space? And then you went around to different college campuses and just, like, handed them out. So, I mean, what did people think? Did they think you were a crackpot or were they actually, like, huh, this is kind of interesting? How did people respond to you? BRAND: I can't say why it just seemed like the obvious thing to do, but what I had acquired by then was the habit of you have a good idea - and if you're not burdened with a job, which I wasn't, then you just start to work on your cool idea and see if there's anything to it and see if you continue to be amused by it or if other people are. And so I stood in these places where there were young people with open minds and also teachers, many of them involved in astrophysics and the space program and so on. And the ones who were interested would come up and say, what's going on? And I'd say, well, you know, what do you think it'll be like when people really look in the big mirror? So it became just a way to have public discussion on the question of photographing the Earth from space. ZOMORODI: So not too long after, NASA actually did take a picture of the Earth from a satellite and share it, and it was the first time the public saw a picture of the whole Earth. What impact did it have on people? BRAND: So I think the photographs that really got people was the Earthrise photograph from Apollo 8 going around the moon and recording the lunar surface in the foreground and the Earth in the background. And 'cause they were in a big hurry when they took that picture, the horizon is not exactly level. So there's a kind of a interesting, unstable urgency to it as a photograph. And the contrast between the extremely dead, boring-looking, gray, brown planet in the foreground - the moon - with this vivid, scintillating, bright blue, living, but distant and kind of small in the enormity of black space - that contrast is what got people - dead planet, live planet. And we're on the live one. And then that raises a question. Well, now that we've seen that, what does that mean? What do we do with that? (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ZOMORODI: So we're talking about the late '60s here, and that's really when a sort of new consciousness about the environment - this understanding that we are shepherds of the Earth. You put a picture of the planet on the cover of a magazine that you started publishing that you called the Whole Earth Catalog. It became a cult read, and it made you pretty famous in the U. S. You were on late-night talk shows. But for those who are not familiar with it, what was the Whole Earth Catalog? What was in it? BRAND: The Whole Earth Catalog was a very tightly selected and edited collection of tools and ideas. So the important subtitle of the Whole Earth Catalog, was Access to Tools. And it was trying to give you enough of a sample that you can make your own decision. We didn't sell things in the catalog. It was just a catalog of stuff that we were pointing out. We were a pointer, not a seller. ZOMORODI: And it was like, here's where to get the best kerosene lamp, and here's where you can buy instructions to build your own dome on your commune if you wanted. It was all kinds of things, right? Do you remember one thing in that catalog that's standing out to you right now? BRAND: There were things like the snuggly baby carrier, which was just sort of a wrap and attached the baby to the front of the woman in a pleasant way for both the baby and the mother. You know, happy baby food grinder was you could grind your own baby food. Something-or-other jug and bottle cutter was a device that you could put in any bottle and turn it into a glass. This was somehow seen as - we didn't call it ecological yet, but that was - a whole lot of being a hippie was living as cheap as possible, whether or not you happened to have means of your own. And so all the creativity went into learning how to dumpster dive and how to find roadkill that was fresh enough you could cook it and eat it or make a hat out of it or something. ZOMORODI: OK. So in 2005, many years later, Steve Jobs gave a commencement address at Stanford University, where he talked about how inspired he was by the catalog when he was younger, especially by the way it ended. Let's listen. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JOBS: Stewart and his team put out several issues of the Whole Earth Catalog. And then when it had run its course, they put out a final issue. On the back cover of their final issue was a photograph of an early morning country road, the kind you might find yourself hitchhiking on if you were so adventurous. Beneath it were the words stay hungry, stay foolish. It was their farewell message as they signed off. Stay hungry, stay foolish. And I have always wished that for myself. ZOMORODI: Stay hungry, stay foolish - words for someone to live by. But, Stewart, you stopped publishing the Whole Earth Catalog regularly in the middle of the seventies. And now we are coming to a part of your biography that I just don't quite get. So you get introduced to another subculture in California at that point. It definitely wasn't mainstream yet - the world of computers and hackers. But with the back-to-the-land movement, the hippies, they were not into technology. So what was going on that kind of sucked you in. BRAND: Really been coming for a long time in the sense that, in '62, I happened to see - at the Computation Center in Stanford when I was getting a tour, I saw young - we later called them hackers - young programmers playing Spacewar and absolutely filled with glee and out of their body into the computer in these little dueling spaceships on the first interactive computers. So 10 years later, we're up to '72 now, '73. When I stopped the catalog, the guy who ran Rolling Stone magazine, Jann Wenner, invited me to write something for them. And I thought, great, I get to be a journalist. And he said, what do you want to write about? And I said, well, actually, I think something is going on with computers. And I wound up reporting on things going on at Xerox PARC, which was a research center in Palo Alto, and at the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Lab where Spacewar was - had moved right along 10 ten years. It was an even more interesting game. But also, the ARPANET was just starting to happen, what became the internet later on. And robotics was starting to happen. And so there were robots wandering around the laboratory. And I just reported on all of that in '72. The opening line was, ready or not, computers are coming to the people. ZOMORODI: I mean, you were one of the first people who even used the phrase personal computer publicly. BRAND: That's true. I did that in a follow-up version of that article. ZOMORODI: So you saw the direction that computers were going. You saw before a lot of people did that this was going to completely change the world. And you decided to jump in, to throw yourself into the forefront of that conversation. In 1984, you threw yet another legendary event, The Hackers Conference, where you brought together all these incredible minds, I mean, the top engineers and programmers. They were all there. And there are people who say that, if in the '70s, things were kind of bubbling along when it came to tech, this event really kicked off the computer revolution. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BRAND: This ever-expanding library with millions of people online simultaneously, they will all be able to publish simultaneously, add things, annotate, make links, and we hope live in a freer environment than we live in now. ZOMORODI: I mean, on the one hand, it feels strange to me that, like, you go from this back-to-land movement to being in the midst of computers and high-tech stuff. But I guess what was similar with both of them is this indie sort of spirit that there was. It was about - if before you were about making tools available to everyone, this was about making information available to everyone. It was the ideas of creating a digital utopia. BRAND: Well, once computers became personal, they flipped from being seen as these machines of oppression to machines of liberation, because the individual could grab it and then run toward whatever horizon they thought most interesting. And they were not only using it, they were programming it. And so, again, sort of like the Trips Festival, that everybody is a performer, with personal computers, everybody's a creator. So that - this was an unleashing of the most powerful tools individuals had ever had. ZOMORODI: Stewart, it feels like if there's one thing that is a constant throughout your life, it has to be that you get restless. Because a few years after immersing yourself in computers, in business, you pivoted yet again, and you started another organization. And you called it The Long Now. Basically, this is a nonprofit dedicated to getting people, getting all of us to think more long term about the future. Why did you think people needed this? BRAND: Well, my sort of opening line of, what is the Long Now Foundation for, is that humanity has revved itself into a pathologically short attention span. And that thanks to science, we know a whole lot more about the long-term past and have a lot more knowledge about the systems that are going to be functioning into the long-term future than we've ever had before. And so to not act on that knowledge is at best a waste and at worst an extreme hazard. ZOMORODI: And kind of the signature project of the Long Now Foundation is this massive clock that you're building, a clock to keep time for 10,000 years. It ticks just once a year and bongs just once a century. And the goal of the project is to encourage us to think about our connection to the centuries, to the millennia, ahead of us. You actually gave a TED Talk about the clock in 2004. Let's listen. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)BRAND: For 10 years, I've been trying to figure out how to hack civilization so that we can get long-term thinking to be automatic and common instead of difficult and rare or, in some cases, nonexistent. It would be helpful if humanity got into the habit of thinking of the now not just as next week or next quarter, the next 10,000 years and the last 10,000 years - basically, civilization's story so far. So we have the Long Now Foundation in San Francisco. It's an incubator for about a dozen projects, all having to do with continuity over the long term. Our core project is a rather ambitious folly - I suppose, a mythic undertaking - to build a 10,000-year clock that can really good - keep good time for that long a period. And the design problems of a project like that are just absolutely delicious. How do you house an eventual monumental clock like this so it can really tick, keep good - save time beautifully for 100 centuries? ZOMORODI: So here we are now, Stewart, 20 years later. Where's the clock? BRAND: Clock's in a mountain in west Texas and nearing completion. It'll be operational and should be visitable by later in this decade. ZOMORODI: How do you explain the purpose of the clock to people who might think it's a ridiculous way to spend time and money - I mean, you called it a folly yourself - when we have so many problems on Earth right here and right now? BRAND: It's hard. It's land art. In this particular case, it's a machine. It's a great, big mechanism that, all by itself, just using the energy and the difference between a cold night and a hot day, drives a genuine clock to keep very good time. And it also has chimes designed by Brian Eno. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)BRAND: Jeff Bezos paid for it and also participated in the design. I visited it a couple of times. It is intended to be mythic. And I think it achieves that. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ZOMORODI: I can only imagine the sense of smallness one must feel as a human, who will live less than a century, compared to this timelessness that you are capturing with the project. But I have to say, one thing that sort of seems like a paradox to me is that, as you said, one of the biggest supporters of the Long Now Clock is Jeff Bezos, Amazon's founder, the sort of king of our on-demand, consumerist society. And many people blame him for exactly the problems you're hoping to solve even just a little bit with this project. BRAND: Good Lord. I think that's completely misplaced. ZOMORODI: Really? BRAND: Talk about access to tools and ideas. And that's where I buy most of my stuff, don't you? ZOMORODI: I really try not to, Stewart. I mean, I have - take a lot of issue with warehouse conditions, how much they pay their workers, how they undercut small businesses and people willing to buy things just because they can so easily. It just. . . BRAND: (Laughter). ZOMORODI: I take a lot of - I have a lot of problems with Amazon. BRAND: OK. Let's see. Do I have problems with Amazon? ZOMORODI: I mean, climate change also. Like. . . BRAND: Well, I mean, I got - because I knew the guy who started it and knew - who I got to know because his very first hire, besides his wife, was a guy who used to work at the Whole Earth Catalog, so I got to know Bezos very early on. And when they went public, it was sort of considered a really risky thing to put money into, you know? Amazon. toast, some were calling it. But I wished him well and was buying books from them then. So I bought a little bit of stock in the very beginning and then, you know, watched it get threatened for a few years. And now I'm very glad I have it. The thing I'm having to keep saying from the beginning with the internet is that it was always a mixed bag. And yet somehow, things proceeded and became OK. By and large, what we've got is much wider capabilities and communication opportunities than we had before. And we shouldn't be blaming the folks who provided that because they got big. We got big because we used them. ZOMORODI: Yeah. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)BRAND: But, look; this is a debate. All of these things are negotiations that go on. And they're important. And they never quite finish. You solve one set of problems. And another set comes along, which is even stronger. And that's just how it goes over time. ZOMORODI: All right, agree to disagree. I'm going to send you an article that I wrote. I hope that's OK. BRAND: Oh, good. Yes, please. Thank you. ZOMORODI: (Laughter). Coming up, more from my conversation with Stewart Brand about the big ideas filling his mind today, projects he's working on, like bringing the woolly mammoth back to life. I'm Manoush Zomorodi. And you're listening to the TED RADIO HOUR from NPR. We'll be right back. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ZOMORODI: It's the TED RADIO HOUR from NPR. I'm Manoush Zomorodi. Today on the show, a conversation with futurist Stewart Brand, who has had quite a few pivots in his life from a stint as a photographer and journalist to starting the first hackers convention and then the Long Now Foundation. And for the past decade or so, Stewart has gone in yet another direction - this time, to a project straight out of science fiction - the possibility of bringing back extinct species. Here he is talking about it on the TED stage in 2013. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)BRAND: Now, extinction is a different kind of death. We didn't really realize that until 1914, when the last passenger pigeon, a female named Martha, died at the Cincinnati Zoo. This had been the most abundant bird in the world. It had been in North America for 6 million years. Suddenly, it wasn't here at all. The Carolina parakeet was a parrot that lit up backyards everywhere. It was hunted to death for his feathers. There's a bird that people liked on the East Coast called the heath hen. It was loved. They tried to protect it. It died anyway. A local newspaper spelled out, there's no survivor. There's no future. There's no life to be recreated in this form ever again. There's a sense of deep tragedy that goes with these things, and they happen to lots of birds that people love. That happened to lots of mammals. Another keystone species is a famous animal called the European aurochs. And the aurochs was like the bison. This was an animal that basically kept the forest mixed with grasslands across the entire Europe and Asian continent, from Spain to Korea. The extinctions still go on. There's an ibex in Spain called the bucardo, went extinct in 2000. There was a marvelous animal, a marsupial wolf called the thylacine - Tasmania, south of Australia, called the Tasmanian tiger. It was hunted until there were just a few left to die in zoos. Sorrow, anger, mourning. Don't mourn. Organize 'cause the fact is, humans have made a huge hole in nature in the last 10,000 years. We have the ability now and maybe the moral obligation to repair some of the damage. Most of that we'll do by expanding and protecting wild lands, by expanding and protecting the populations of endangered species. But some species that we killed off totally we could consider bringing back to a world that misses them. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)BRAND: I think it's time for the subject to go public. What do people think about it? You know, do you want extinct species back? Do you want extinct species back? (APPLAUSE)ZOMORODI: All right. So walk me through this, Stewart. How is de-extinction supposed to work? BRAND: So, well, it's called ancient DNA - basically DNA from dead animals, dead in museums or dead in the ground. You can actually basically reassemble from the zillion fragments a very good sense of what the original genome was. And if you can compare it to a closely related living animal, you've got a structure where you can, you know, really make it - not only approximate the original reality, but you can think about editing some of those genes into the relative and potentially moving them in the direction of the extinct animal. And so you adjust the genome of Asian elephants, who are the closest living relative of woolly mammoths and begin to get an elephant that can once again reinhabit the mammoth steppe of northern Eurasia and North America. ZOMORODI: I mean, once again, you are taking an idea that is sort of niche and bringing it to the general public, giving it a name, calling it de-extinction. What do people think about it? BRAND: I think so long as it's a theoretical idea, the argument is not as substantial as one would like. And so we've now done cloning of endangered species, two of them - Przewalski's horse, which is the true, original wild horse, and the black-footed ferret, which is America's most endangered mammal. These animals are not extinct, but they - both of them were running out of the genetic variability they needed to have a really healthy genome. And by cloning some animals whose cells were preserved 30 years ago, we're able to reenrich the genome. And that's a piece of the kind of thing we're talking about with de-extinction. ZOMORODI: But I want to go back to the more - I don't know - sexy and divisive example that you've been associated with, which is this idea of bringing back the woolly mammoth. I just watched the documentary about your life. And you've actually seen frozen woolly mammoth bodies, right? BRAND: Yeah. A trunk in a - in Siberia. That's amazing. ZOMORODI: Who - what was that like? I mean, who - where are these bodies kept? Tell me about that experience. BRAND: OK, so the Mammoth Steppe, once upon a time, was like the Serengeti. The northern grasslands - that's where a steppe is, where the - maybe the largest biome in the world. And it had cave bears. It had all kinds of grazing animals, which were making the grasslands actually work, musk oxen and woolly mammoths, woolly rhinoceros. And then humans show up, and all of those megafauna disappeared. And so that's what happened to the large animals of that terrain. And it turned into tundra. And now the tundra is busy melting. And this is very bad for climate. So what one would like is to bring the grasslands back, and that's what this outfit called Pleistocene Park is in the process of proving you can do. ZOMORODI: And you visited this area - right? - in Siberia, where. . . BRAND: I did visit there, and it's great fun. So in Yakutsk, which is sort of the largest city in that enormous region, they have freezers full of well-preserved mammoth flesh from on the order of many thousands of years ago, mostly more than 60,000 years ago and older. ZOMORODI: I mean, talk about mind-blowing, huh? BRAND: Yeah. And so these are like museum specimens. It's not frozen in the sense that it's cryopreserved and you can just take the DNA and bring it back to life. But you got a lot to work with on the project to eventually bring back a cold-adapted elephant. Now, elephants used to be on every continent except Antarctica. They were a real keystone species. They're even what are called the bioengineers, in the sense that they knocked down trees. They're good at that. And so they keep the landscape a mosaic. A mosaic is the richest possible landscape you can have, where there's shrublands, woodlands, grasslands all mixed closely together and all changing around one to another. And so everywhere that elephants were, you had a much richer ecology than you have where you don't have elephants anymore. And this was particularly the case way the hell up north. So, you know, part of what's taken over that terrain is the forests of very boring, un-ecologically rich conifers that are not the kind of rich forest that you want. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSICZOMORODI: OK. So say this place in Siberia called Pleistocene Park can, in theory, support woolly mammoths again. I mean, Stewart, come on. Didn't we learn our lesson from \"Jurassic Park\"? We don't know how nature will react to being manipulated, at least not to this extreme, right? BRAND: Yes, we do. We do know. ZOMORODI: To this extreme? BRAND: OK, so \"Jurassic Park,\" you know, the line that everybody quotes as, oh, my God, watch out, their character says, \"life finds a way. \"(SOUNDBITE OF MOVIE, \"JURASSIC PARK\")BD WONG: (As Henry Wu) You're implying that a group composed entirely of female animals will breed? JEFF GOLDBLUM: (As Dr. Ian Malcolm) No. I'm simply saying that life finds a way. BRAND: It's actually how reintroduction of animals, which is done all of the time by wildlife biologists, it succeeds because life finds a way. So when the apex predator of wolves was brought back to Yellowstone Park after a century of having been hunted out of existence, it turned out not only good for the wolves, it turned out good for the whole ecosystem. The rivers became richer and so on. Same thing is happening with beavers reintroduced from Europe. They've been gone for 400 years from Scotland. They were brought back, and Scotland instantly got ecologically richer, to the point that England is now doing the same thing. So we have every region going through all of those stages with de-extincted creatures will be exactly like the reintroductions that are done now all the time. ZOMORODI: So, OK, so let's say you can convince people that maybe de-extinction isn't dangerous, and that it might be one way of helping solve climate change. Do you think. . . BRAND: Let me focus on that it isn't me or anyone else convincing people. It's success convincing people. We've learned this over and over again, especially in conservation biology, that what is persuasive is a successful outcome. And to get to that, you have to go through the process of, you're not sure if it's going to be a success. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ZOMORODI: With all these cultural shifts that we've discussed over the last hour, do you feel that you helped make them happen? Or were you really just very good at understanding how to explain them to people on a broader scale, gathering the key people together, giving these subcultures names and sort of making them feel inevitable? BRAND: Yeah, there's some of that. Basically, Manoush, what I do when I see what I think is an interesting area and it feels like a problem area that I might be able to and some ability to help, then I'll think about what's the mode that might do that. Like with the image of Earth button campaign seemed like the right thing to do. Each time I get on these problem areas or opportunity areas, I think about, you know, is this one for a book or event or organization? ZOMORODI: But it sounds like having a good time to you is following your curiosity. BRAND: Yeah, I think that's right. And, you know, what are the interesting problems? That question turns out to keep some very easily bored people fascinated. ZOMORODI: Stewart, I've read that people, young entrepreneurs especially, love to ask your advice, and I've heard that they ask you one particular question. How do you stay so creative? Is that true? Is that the No. 1 question you get asked? BRAND: No. It's mostly about, you know, how did that work back in the day in the Bay Area in the '60s and '70s and '80s? And is it working now? And how do you get the best benefit of the Bay Area? And the thing I point out is San Francisco area is a little different than Los Angeles or New York in the sense that people don't go to San Francisco to succeed, or at least not most of the time. They go to San Francisco to be happy. And that keeps them loose enough, focusing enough on trying stuff - low threshold of success and comfort in, you know, moving on, changing communities, changing disciplines that you work in, having a good time. ZOMORODI: So not to end on a morbid note, but you do think a lot about the future, Stewart. May I ask what you want to happen after your death? Do you want to be an AI version of yourself to - I don't know - live on in the metaverse? Or are you going to have your body cryogenically frozen so we can de-extinct you (laughter)? BRAND: Oh, God. ZOMORODI: Like, what are you going to do? BRAND: I have picked a nice place to be planted, and I like the idea of being planted intact. It's one of those sort of semi-organic graveyards where they - you don't have yourself one approved crypt. You have some kind of wood or otherwise biodegradable coffin. And I'm biodegradable, so I can't imagine doing anything cryogenic. And you never know. ZOMORODI: What if we contribute this conversation to, like, the database that's compiling everything you've ever said so that they could make an AI version of you? BRAND: Oh, gosh. You know, anybody who wants to become a scholar of that. . . (LAUGHTER)BRAND: And, you know, it gives them freedom. They can pick and choose whichever version of the character. They pick the setting they want. ZOMORODI: Oh, OK. So, like, we could just hang out with 1966 Stewart. BRAND: Yeah, sure. Why not? ZOMORODI: There's a book that's an extremely comprehensive biography of your life. There's a documentary coming out - also very comprehensive. There is something about you that fascinates people, Stewart. And I guess I'm wondering, if you had to pick one, what do you hope your biggest legacy is? BRAND: It's hard to know. You know, legacies have their own life. One of the things I was surprised by in biographies is - I hadn't really paid attention to it, but reviews of biographies are usually a review of the subject more than the book itself. And so, boy, have I been getting mixed reviews out there, from, pay no attention to this Zen playboy, to, you know, here's the key to understanding the last 50 years. They're all looking at the same book. So. . . ZOMORODI: You're complicated, Stewart. BRAND: No, it's just what people do. So, you know, we held a 50th anniversary of Whole Earth Catalog, and we printed up a T-shirt for people that said, still hungry, still foolish. And I put it on the back of the Whole Earth epilogue in 1973. And what did I mean about it at the time? I was - it's appetite. It's willingness to be ridiculous on the way to something you think might be interesting. But everybody has their own reading, I guess. ZOMORODI: Stewart Brand, thank you so much. BRAND: Well, thank you. This was great. ZOMORODI: Stewart is currently working on his seventh book. It's called \"The Maintenance Of Everything. \" And he's writing about maintaining, well, everything from sailboats to civilizations. And you can see all of his previous TED talks at ted. com. And if you want to learn more about Stewart Brand and all the ideas that we talked about, check out John Markoff's biography \"Whole Earth: The Many Lives Of Stewart Brand\" and the documentary film \"We Are As Gods\" - many thanks to them for their help, too. Thank you so much for listening to our show this week. It was produced and edited by Rachel Faulkner, Katie Simon and me, with help from producers Katie Monteleone and James Delahoussaye. Our production staff at NPR also includes Sanaz Meshkinpour, Fiona Geiran, Matthew Cloutier, Katherine Sypher, Julia Carney and Beth Donovan. Our theme music was written by Ramtin Arablouei. Our partners at TED are Chris Anderson, Colin Helms, Anna Phelan, Michelle Quint, Sammy Case and Daniella Balarezo. I'm Manoush Zomorodi, and you've been listening to the TED Radio Hour from NPR. MANOUSH ZOMORODI, HOST:   It's the TED RADIO HOUR from NPR. I'm Manoush Zomorodi. And you may have heard of Zelig or Forrest Gump, a character who always seems to turn up at just the right time, in just the right place, smack dab at the center of all the action. Well, that is the best way to describe Stewart Brand. STEWART BRAND: Hi, Manoush. ZOMORODI: Hi, Stewart. Thank you so much for doing this. You may never have heard of him, but he has been right next to - even propelling - some of the biggest names and movements of the last century. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: And by the time all the rest of us get there, he's gone on to something else more interesting. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: He could see into the future that this technology was going to be a huge part of American culture. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: It isn't so much that he's ahead of it; he's actually creating the future. ZOMORODI: Brand is nearly 84 years old now, and we wanted to spend the hour with him looking back at how he shaped our culture through the years, like with his Whole Earth Catalog, a counterculture magazine that Steve Jobs once called Google in paperback form. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) STEVE JOBS: . . . Google in paperback form 35 years before Google came along. It was idealistic, overflowing with neat tools and great notions. ZOMORODI: Others credit Brand with helping kickstart the environmental movement in the U. S. and later turning the Bay Area into Silicon Valley, home to the world's most successful tech companies. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: In the beginning, the people who worked with computers were considered magicians. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #5: Abracadabra. ZOMORODI: His never-ending curiosity continues to this day. BRAND: And there's kind of a hunger and foolishness to it. It's appetite. It's willingness to be ridiculous on the way to something you think might be interesting. ZOMORODI: And over the last few years, Stewart Brand has taken on new, mind-bending projects, like working to bring back extinct animals like the woolly mammoth and building a clock to ring once a century and keep time for 10,000 years. BRAND: Humanity has revved itself into a pathologically short attention span and to not think about long ranges of time is, at best, a waste and, at worst, an extreme hazard. ZOMORODI: So today on the show, Stewart Brand, a conversation with a controversial cult figure who's always looking at where society is going next and has some big - some say crazy - ideas about where it should be going. Stewart, welcome to the TED RADIO HOUR. BRAND: Thank you. ZOMORODI: I want to start by asking you - you have lived an incredible life, but let's go back to the beginning. Tell us a bit about where you grew up, Rockford, Ill. Did you have visions of what you would be when you grew up? BRAND: Oh, yeah. I knew I was going to be a veterinarian. I was the guy that everybody brought injured or young, abandoned wild animals to, and I would try to raise them. ZOMORODI: Aw. And did your parents support that endeavor, or were they horrified? BRAND: Always supportive, actually, even of the nasty possum I had named Frank, who was - bad attitude. . . ZOMORODI: (Laughter). BRAND: . . . About everything. ZOMORODI: So in the late '50s, you went into the Army Reserve and to Stanford University, where I guess the veterinary dream continued because you majored in biology, and your thesis was about the lives of tarantulas. BRAND: Well, yeah, studying biology was - I majored in science partly to get away from the problem I saw in the humanities, which was that what was deemed good was based on a judgment call by the teacher or the, you know, section leader or something like that - you know, what they thought were the right ways to think about Shakespeare or whatever. And that kind of being driven by opinion was not the case with science, and there you had to actually deal with reality that often flew in the face of people's opinion. And I liked that. ZOMORODI: I mean, that's so interesting that you say that 'cause it sounds like you gravitated towards knowing what was right or fact or a binary. And I think of what happened next, which was that at the end of college, after you graduated, you started spending time in a very humanities, writerly, bohemian scene living in San Francisco. That seems like a change. What do you think happened there? BRAND: Well, I was moving toward where the creatives were. And, you know, there's creativity in science, and there's creativity in art. And they are drastically different in a lot of ways, but they're also drastically the same in a lot of ways. There's a kind of a criticism in my family among some folks in Rockford that brands are so contrary. If you throw one in the river, they'll float upstream. And. . ZOMORODI: (Laughter). BRAND: . . . Floating upstream, that is looking upstream and thinking upstream is what scientists do. You're always looking for discovery. It's what artists do. You don't want to repeat what any other artist is doing or even what you yourself used to be doing. And that was one of the things I picked up from the artists in the world around San Francisco's north beaches - never repeat yourself. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ZOMORODI: Yeah. So you got to San Francisco in the mid-'60s. And by this point, you were freelancing as a photographer, but you also started hanging out with Ken Kesey, who, of course, wrote \"One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest,\" one of my favorite books. And he had this legendary group of friends and comrades, and they called themselves the Merry Pranksters. And you ended up joining. This group traveled all over the U. S. in a psychedelic bus, renouncing normal society. They also did a fair amount of LSD. Just describe it. What was life like for you then? BRAND: Well, the attraction of the pranksters was they really did inhabit the raggedy edge. And Kesey and the whole group developed a fearlessness, a boldness that I found very attractive. It was the kind of thing that - a young person wants to go, you know, where it's dangerous. And that group definitely was where it was dangerous. It was dangerous in terms of the messing around with drugs we were doing. It was dangerous in terms of having Neal Cassady be the driver of the bus. ZOMORODI: And there was a lot going on in the country at that time. JFK had been assassinated. The civil rights movement was in full swing. And you found yourself kind of at the nexus of a huge culture shift that was happening all around the country. BRAND: That's right. It was mostly still new left at that point. It was - the Vietnam War was coming on, and people were getting worked up about that and organizing. There were hippies around, and we didn't know that there were 10,000 hippies in the Bay Area until I and Kesey and the Pranksters put on a thing called the Trips Festival in January of 1966, when LSD was still legal, by the way. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #6: The acid test is everywhere in this spaceship. Everywhere you are - you're all acid testing. BRAND: And it was a huge event, and it became kind of a watershed event. That's when hippies became aware there were so many of them, they were a movement. ZOMORODI: OK, so this was an event that you organized that wound up being one of the biggest festivals of the era. In fact, like, the Grateful Dead went big because of it. And some people say that the Trips Festival helped mark the beginning of the hippie counterculture movement. I mean, this must have been some party, Stewart. What do you remember of it, if anything? BRAND: Well, the - what we are attempting to do, and why we called it Trips Festival, was to find all the really interesting, creative people that we knew in the Bay Area and basically just have a show three nights at the Longshoremen's Hall in San Francisco, where everybody showed what they had. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) UNIDENTIFIED MUSICAL ARTIST: (Singing, inaudible). BRAND: There was - along with artists doing their thing, there was a sculptor named Ron Boise who made these enormous, noisy sculptures that you would bang on and pluck at strings and make sort of group music. It was sort of just the beginning of a kind of dancing that - I mean, I grew up doing the damn foxtrot. ZOMORODI: (Laughter). BRAND: And what I loved about the Bohemian world is dancing was just - go out in the middle of the floor, and carry on, with somebody or not, and disappear into the music and see what happens. When the bands were playing especially, it just became this huge bash, everybody on their feet dancing. And the kind of thing we see at Burning Man ever since, for example, is a direct result of people discovering how much fun you can have if you just threw yourself completely into being part of the performance. ZOMORODI: So it was a couple of months after the Trips Festival that you took LSD on your own and zeroed in on a provocative question, which was, why haven't people seen a photo of the Earth from space? Nowadays that would maybe be turned into an online conspiracy theory. But that's not what happened. What did happen? What did you do? BRAND: What was happening was I was reading and listening to Buckminster Fuller in those days, and he was focused on sort of world system thinking. And I was also a photographer, so I'm always thinking about, what are the images that change people's minds? And I was on the rooftop of my place in North Beach in San Francisco with, you know, probably a half-dose, quarter-dose of LSD, just watching the afternoon scintillate, and then pretended to myself that I can see the buildings downtown - the tall buildings were not exactly parallel. They diverged slightly because they were on the curved surface of the Earth. And then I imagined myself going to a higher and higher altitude, and that curve would extend and then close all the way around on itself. And you would have San Francisco as seen from space on the surface of the sphere. And that point, this is 10 years since Sputnik. And so it certainly seemed very strange to me that both the Soviet Union and the United States had been in space for - on the order of 10 years, and I could have taken serious photographs near Earth from space and apparently hadn't done so. And I just thought, well, as soon as that photograph happens, everything's going to change because I knew enough science to know that the way people thought the Earth looks from space was not the way it probably really looked. And the difference would blow their mind, in the parlance of the time. And a year or two later, that's exactly what happened. ZOMORODI: In a moment, Stewart Brand describes how seeing the Earth from space for the first time really did change how people thought about our place in the universe and why it inspired him to launch something called the Whole Earth Catalog. I'm Manoush Zomorodi, and you're listening to the TED Radio Hour from NPR. Stay with us. It's the TED RADIO HOUR from NPR. I'm Manoush Zomorodi. Today, we are talking to writer and futurist Stewart Brand, who helped usher in San Francisco's hippie counterculture in the 1960s. And as we heard before the break, Stewart got somewhat obsessed with wanting to see a picture of Earth from space. Now, remember, this was before the moon landing, when satellites and space travel were pretty new. And, Stewart, you became kind of an analog meme, I think it's fair to say, in some ways. You made this big sign, and you printed out a bunch of buttons that ask the question, why haven't we seen a photo of the Earth from space? And then you went around to different college campuses and just, like, handed them out. So, I mean, what did people think? Did they think you were a crackpot or were they actually, like, huh, this is kind of interesting? How did people respond to you? BRAND: I can't say why it just seemed like the obvious thing to do, but what I had acquired by then was the habit of you have a good idea - and if you're not burdened with a job, which I wasn't, then you just start to work on your cool idea and see if there's anything to it and see if you continue to be amused by it or if other people are. And so I stood in these places where there were young people with open minds and also teachers, many of them involved in astrophysics and the space program and so on. And the ones who were interested would come up and say, what's going on? And I'd say, well, you know, what do you think it'll be like when people really look in the big mirror? So it became just a way to have public discussion on the question of photographing the Earth from space. ZOMORODI: So not too long after, NASA actually did take a picture of the Earth from a satellite and share it, and it was the first time the public saw a picture of the whole Earth. What impact did it have on people? BRAND: So I think the photographs that really got people was the Earthrise photograph from Apollo 8 going around the moon and recording the lunar surface in the foreground and the Earth in the background. And 'cause they were in a big hurry when they took that picture, the horizon is not exactly level. So there's a kind of a interesting, unstable urgency to it as a photograph. And the contrast between the extremely dead, boring-looking, gray, brown planet in the foreground - the moon - with this vivid, scintillating, bright blue, living, but distant and kind of small in the enormity of black space - that contrast is what got people - dead planet, live planet. And we're on the live one. And then that raises a question. Well, now that we've seen that, what does that mean? What do we do with that? (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ZOMORODI: So we're talking about the late '60s here, and that's really when a sort of new consciousness about the environment - this understanding that we are shepherds of the Earth. You put a picture of the planet on the cover of a magazine that you started publishing that you called the Whole Earth Catalog. It became a cult read, and it made you pretty famous in the U. S. You were on late-night talk shows. But for those who are not familiar with it, what was the Whole Earth Catalog? What was in it? BRAND: The Whole Earth Catalog was a very tightly selected and edited collection of tools and ideas. So the important subtitle of the Whole Earth Catalog, was Access to Tools. And it was trying to give you enough of a sample that you can make your own decision. We didn't sell things in the catalog. It was just a catalog of stuff that we were pointing out. We were a pointer, not a seller. ZOMORODI: And it was like, here's where to get the best kerosene lamp, and here's where you can buy instructions to build your own dome on your commune if you wanted. It was all kinds of things, right? Do you remember one thing in that catalog that's standing out to you right now? BRAND: There were things like the snuggly baby carrier, which was just sort of a wrap and attached the baby to the front of the woman in a pleasant way for both the baby and the mother. You know, happy baby food grinder was you could grind your own baby food. Something-or-other jug and bottle cutter was a device that you could put in any bottle and turn it into a glass. This was somehow seen as - we didn't call it ecological yet, but that was - a whole lot of being a hippie was living as cheap as possible, whether or not you happened to have means of your own. And so all the creativity went into learning how to dumpster dive and how to find roadkill that was fresh enough you could cook it and eat it or make a hat out of it or something. ZOMORODI: OK. So in 2005, many years later, Steve Jobs gave a commencement address at Stanford University, where he talked about how inspired he was by the catalog when he was younger, especially by the way it ended. Let's listen. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JOBS: Stewart and his team put out several issues of the Whole Earth Catalog. And then when it had run its course, they put out a final issue. On the back cover of their final issue was a photograph of an early morning country road, the kind you might find yourself hitchhiking on if you were so adventurous. Beneath it were the words stay hungry, stay foolish. It was their farewell message as they signed off. Stay hungry, stay foolish. And I have always wished that for myself. ZOMORODI: Stay hungry, stay foolish - words for someone to live by. But, Stewart, you stopped publishing the Whole Earth Catalog regularly in the middle of the seventies. And now we are coming to a part of your biography that I just don't quite get. So you get introduced to another subculture in California at that point. It definitely wasn't mainstream yet - the world of computers and hackers. But with the back-to-the-land movement, the hippies, they were not into technology. So what was going on that kind of sucked you in. BRAND: Really been coming for a long time in the sense that, in '62, I happened to see - at the Computation Center in Stanford when I was getting a tour, I saw young - we later called them hackers - young programmers playing Spacewar and absolutely filled with glee and out of their body into the computer in these little dueling spaceships on the first interactive computers. So 10 years later, we're up to '72 now, '73. When I stopped the catalog, the guy who ran Rolling Stone magazine, Jann Wenner, invited me to write something for them. And I thought, great, I get to be a journalist. And he said, what do you want to write about? And I said, well, actually, I think something is going on with computers. And I wound up reporting on things going on at Xerox PARC, which was a research center in Palo Alto, and at the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Lab where Spacewar was - had moved right along 10 ten years. It was an even more interesting game. But also, the ARPANET was just starting to happen, what became the internet later on. And robotics was starting to happen. And so there were robots wandering around the laboratory. And I just reported on all of that in '72. The opening line was, ready or not, computers are coming to the people. ZOMORODI: I mean, you were one of the first people who even used the phrase personal computer publicly. BRAND: That's true. I did that in a follow-up version of that article. ZOMORODI: So you saw the direction that computers were going. You saw before a lot of people did that this was going to completely change the world. And you decided to jump in, to throw yourself into the forefront of that conversation. In 1984, you threw yet another legendary event, The Hackers Conference, where you brought together all these incredible minds, I mean, the top engineers and programmers. They were all there. And there are people who say that, if in the '70s, things were kind of bubbling along when it came to tech, this event really kicked off the computer revolution. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BRAND: This ever-expanding library with millions of people online simultaneously, they will all be able to publish simultaneously, add things, annotate, make links, and we hope live in a freer environment than we live in now. ZOMORODI: I mean, on the one hand, it feels strange to me that, like, you go from this back-to-land movement to being in the midst of computers and high-tech stuff. But I guess what was similar with both of them is this indie sort of spirit that there was. It was about - if before you were about making tools available to everyone, this was about making information available to everyone. It was the ideas of creating a digital utopia. BRAND: Well, once computers became personal, they flipped from being seen as these machines of oppression to machines of liberation, because the individual could grab it and then run toward whatever horizon they thought most interesting. And they were not only using it, they were programming it. And so, again, sort of like the Trips Festival, that everybody is a performer, with personal computers, everybody's a creator. So that - this was an unleashing of the most powerful tools individuals had ever had. ZOMORODI: Stewart, it feels like if there's one thing that is a constant throughout your life, it has to be that you get restless. Because a few years after immersing yourself in computers, in business, you pivoted yet again, and you started another organization. And you called it The Long Now. Basically, this is a nonprofit dedicated to getting people, getting all of us to think more long term about the future. Why did you think people needed this? BRAND: Well, my sort of opening line of, what is the Long Now Foundation for, is that humanity has revved itself into a pathologically short attention span. And that thanks to science, we know a whole lot more about the long-term past and have a lot more knowledge about the systems that are going to be functioning into the long-term future than we've ever had before. And so to not act on that knowledge is at best a waste and at worst an extreme hazard. ZOMORODI: And kind of the signature project of the Long Now Foundation is this massive clock that you're building, a clock to keep time for 10,000 years. It ticks just once a year and bongs just once a century. And the goal of the project is to encourage us to think about our connection to the centuries, to the millennia, ahead of us. You actually gave a TED Talk about the clock in 2004. Let's listen. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) BRAND: For 10 years, I've been trying to figure out how to hack civilization so that we can get long-term thinking to be automatic and common instead of difficult and rare or, in some cases, nonexistent. It would be helpful if humanity got into the habit of thinking of the now not just as next week or next quarter, the next 10,000 years and the last 10,000 years - basically, civilization's story so far. So we have the Long Now Foundation in San Francisco. It's an incubator for about a dozen projects, all having to do with continuity over the long term. Our core project is a rather ambitious folly - I suppose, a mythic undertaking - to build a 10,000-year clock that can really good - keep good time for that long a period. And the design problems of a project like that are just absolutely delicious. How do you house an eventual monumental clock like this so it can really tick, keep good - save time beautifully for 100 centuries? ZOMORODI: So here we are now, Stewart, 20 years later. Where's the clock? BRAND: Clock's in a mountain in west Texas and nearing completion. It'll be operational and should be visitable by later in this decade. ZOMORODI: How do you explain the purpose of the clock to people who might think it's a ridiculous way to spend time and money - I mean, you called it a folly yourself - when we have so many problems on Earth right here and right now? BRAND: It's hard. It's land art. In this particular case, it's a machine. It's a great, big mechanism that, all by itself, just using the energy and the difference between a cold night and a hot day, drives a genuine clock to keep very good time. And it also has chimes designed by Brian Eno. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) BRAND: Jeff Bezos paid for it and also participated in the design. I visited it a couple of times. It is intended to be mythic. And I think it achieves that. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ZOMORODI: I can only imagine the sense of smallness one must feel as a human, who will live less than a century, compared to this timelessness that you are capturing with the project. But I have to say, one thing that sort of seems like a paradox to me is that, as you said, one of the biggest supporters of the Long Now Clock is Jeff Bezos, Amazon's founder, the sort of king of our on-demand, consumerist society. And many people blame him for exactly the problems you're hoping to solve even just a little bit with this project. BRAND: Good Lord. I think that's completely misplaced. ZOMORODI: Really? BRAND: Talk about access to tools and ideas. And that's where I buy most of my stuff, don't you? ZOMORODI: I really try not to, Stewart. I mean, I have - take a lot of issue with warehouse conditions, how much they pay their workers, how they undercut small businesses and people willing to buy things just because they can so easily. It just. . . BRAND: (Laughter). ZOMORODI: I take a lot of - I have a lot of problems with Amazon. BRAND: OK. Let's see. Do I have problems with Amazon? ZOMORODI: I mean, climate change also. Like. . . BRAND: Well, I mean, I got - because I knew the guy who started it and knew - who I got to know because his very first hire, besides his wife, was a guy who used to work at the Whole Earth Catalog, so I got to know Bezos very early on. And when they went public, it was sort of considered a really risky thing to put money into, you know? Amazon. toast, some were calling it. But I wished him well and was buying books from them then. So I bought a little bit of stock in the very beginning and then, you know, watched it get threatened for a few years. And now I'm very glad I have it. The thing I'm having to keep saying from the beginning with the internet is that it was always a mixed bag. And yet somehow, things proceeded and became OK. By and large, what we've got is much wider capabilities and communication opportunities than we had before. And we shouldn't be blaming the folks who provided that because they got big. We got big because we used them. ZOMORODI: Yeah. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) BRAND: But, look; this is a debate. All of these things are negotiations that go on. And they're important. And they never quite finish. You solve one set of problems. And another set comes along, which is even stronger. And that's just how it goes over time. ZOMORODI: All right, agree to disagree. I'm going to send you an article that I wrote. I hope that's OK. BRAND: Oh, good. Yes, please. Thank you. ZOMORODI: (Laughter). Coming up, more from my conversation with Stewart Brand about the big ideas filling his mind today, projects he's working on, like bringing the woolly mammoth back to life. I'm Manoush Zomorodi. And you're listening to the TED RADIO HOUR from NPR. We'll be right back. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ZOMORODI: It's the TED RADIO HOUR from NPR. I'm Manoush Zomorodi. Today on the show, a conversation with futurist Stewart Brand, who has had quite a few pivots in his life from a stint as a photographer and journalist to starting the first hackers convention and then the Long Now Foundation. And for the past decade or so, Stewart has gone in yet another direction - this time, to a project straight out of science fiction - the possibility of bringing back extinct species. Here he is talking about it on the TED stage in 2013. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) BRAND: Now, extinction is a different kind of death. We didn't really realize that until 1914, when the last passenger pigeon, a female named Martha, died at the Cincinnati Zoo. This had been the most abundant bird in the world. It had been in North America for 6 million years. Suddenly, it wasn't here at all. The Carolina parakeet was a parrot that lit up backyards everywhere. It was hunted to death for his feathers. There's a bird that people liked on the East Coast called the heath hen. It was loved. They tried to protect it. It died anyway. A local newspaper spelled out, there's no survivor. There's no future. There's no life to be recreated in this form ever again. There's a sense of deep tragedy that goes with these things, and they happen to lots of birds that people love. That happened to lots of mammals. Another keystone species is a famous animal called the European aurochs. And the aurochs was like the bison. This was an animal that basically kept the forest mixed with grasslands across the entire Europe and Asian continent, from Spain to Korea. The extinctions still go on. There's an ibex in Spain called the bucardo, went extinct in 2000. There was a marvelous animal, a marsupial wolf called the thylacine - Tasmania, south of Australia, called the Tasmanian tiger. It was hunted until there were just a few left to die in zoos. Sorrow, anger, mourning. Don't mourn. Organize 'cause the fact is, humans have made a huge hole in nature in the last 10,000 years. We have the ability now and maybe the moral obligation to repair some of the damage. Most of that we'll do by expanding and protecting wild lands, by expanding and protecting the populations of endangered species. But some species that we killed off totally we could consider bringing back to a world that misses them. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) BRAND: I think it's time for the subject to go public. What do people think about it? You know, do you want extinct species back? Do you want extinct species back? (APPLAUSE) ZOMORODI: All right. So walk me through this, Stewart. How is de-extinction supposed to work? BRAND: So, well, it's called ancient DNA - basically DNA from dead animals, dead in museums or dead in the ground. You can actually basically reassemble from the zillion fragments a very good sense of what the original genome was. And if you can compare it to a closely related living animal, you've got a structure where you can, you know, really make it - not only approximate the original reality, but you can think about editing some of those genes into the relative and potentially moving them in the direction of the extinct animal. And so you adjust the genome of Asian elephants, who are the closest living relative of woolly mammoths and begin to get an elephant that can once again reinhabit the mammoth steppe of northern Eurasia and North America. ZOMORODI: I mean, once again, you are taking an idea that is sort of niche and bringing it to the general public, giving it a name, calling it de-extinction. What do people think about it? BRAND: I think so long as it's a theoretical idea, the argument is not as substantial as one would like. And so we've now done cloning of endangered species, two of them - Przewalski's horse, which is the true, original wild horse, and the black-footed ferret, which is America's most endangered mammal. These animals are not extinct, but they - both of them were running out of the genetic variability they needed to have a really healthy genome. And by cloning some animals whose cells were preserved 30 years ago, we're able to reenrich the genome. And that's a piece of the kind of thing we're talking about with de-extinction. ZOMORODI: But I want to go back to the more - I don't know - sexy and divisive example that you've been associated with, which is this idea of bringing back the woolly mammoth. I just watched the documentary about your life. And you've actually seen frozen woolly mammoth bodies, right? BRAND: Yeah. A trunk in a - in Siberia. That's amazing. ZOMORODI: Who - what was that like? I mean, who - where are these bodies kept? Tell me about that experience. BRAND: OK, so the Mammoth Steppe, once upon a time, was like the Serengeti. The northern grasslands - that's where a steppe is, where the - maybe the largest biome in the world. And it had cave bears. It had all kinds of grazing animals, which were making the grasslands actually work, musk oxen and woolly mammoths, woolly rhinoceros. And then humans show up, and all of those megafauna disappeared. And so that's what happened to the large animals of that terrain. And it turned into tundra. And now the tundra is busy melting. And this is very bad for climate. So what one would like is to bring the grasslands back, and that's what this outfit called Pleistocene Park is in the process of proving you can do. ZOMORODI: And you visited this area - right? - in Siberia, where. . . BRAND: I did visit there, and it's great fun. So in Yakutsk, which is sort of the largest city in that enormous region, they have freezers full of well-preserved mammoth flesh from on the order of many thousands of years ago, mostly more than 60,000 years ago and older. ZOMORODI: I mean, talk about mind-blowing, huh? BRAND: Yeah. And so these are like museum specimens. It's not frozen in the sense that it's cryopreserved and you can just take the DNA and bring it back to life. But you got a lot to work with on the project to eventually bring back a cold-adapted elephant. Now, elephants used to be on every continent except Antarctica. They were a real keystone species. They're even what are called the bioengineers, in the sense that they knocked down trees. They're good at that. And so they keep the landscape a mosaic. A mosaic is the richest possible landscape you can have, where there's shrublands, woodlands, grasslands all mixed closely together and all changing around one to another. And so everywhere that elephants were, you had a much richer ecology than you have where you don't have elephants anymore. And this was particularly the case way the hell up north. So, you know, part of what's taken over that terrain is the forests of very boring, un-ecologically rich conifers that are not the kind of rich forest that you want. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC ZOMORODI: OK. So say this place in Siberia called Pleistocene Park can, in theory, support woolly mammoths again. I mean, Stewart, come on. Didn't we learn our lesson from \"Jurassic Park\"? We don't know how nature will react to being manipulated, at least not to this extreme, right? BRAND: Yes, we do. We do know. ZOMORODI: To this extreme? BRAND: OK, so \"Jurassic Park,\" you know, the line that everybody quotes as, oh, my God, watch out, their character says, \"life finds a way. \" (SOUNDBITE OF MOVIE, \"JURASSIC PARK\") BD WONG: (As Henry Wu) You're implying that a group composed entirely of female animals will breed? JEFF GOLDBLUM: (As Dr. Ian Malcolm) No. I'm simply saying that life finds a way. BRAND: It's actually how reintroduction of animals, which is done all of the time by wildlife biologists, it succeeds because life finds a way. So when the apex predator of wolves was brought back to Yellowstone Park after a century of having been hunted out of existence, it turned out not only good for the wolves, it turned out good for the whole ecosystem. The rivers became richer and so on. Same thing is happening with beavers reintroduced from Europe. They've been gone for 400 years from Scotland. They were brought back, and Scotland instantly got ecologically richer, to the point that England is now doing the same thing. So we have every region going through all of those stages with de-extincted creatures will be exactly like the reintroductions that are done now all the time. ZOMORODI: So, OK, so let's say you can convince people that maybe de-extinction isn't dangerous, and that it might be one way of helping solve climate change. Do you think. . . BRAND: Let me focus on that it isn't me or anyone else convincing people. It's success convincing people. We've learned this over and over again, especially in conservation biology, that what is persuasive is a successful outcome. And to get to that, you have to go through the process of, you're not sure if it's going to be a success. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ZOMORODI: With all these cultural shifts that we've discussed over the last hour, do you feel that you helped make them happen? Or were you really just very good at understanding how to explain them to people on a broader scale, gathering the key people together, giving these subcultures names and sort of making them feel inevitable? BRAND: Yeah, there's some of that. Basically, Manoush, what I do when I see what I think is an interesting area and it feels like a problem area that I might be able to and some ability to help, then I'll think about what's the mode that might do that. Like with the image of Earth button campaign seemed like the right thing to do. Each time I get on these problem areas or opportunity areas, I think about, you know, is this one for a book or event or organization? ZOMORODI: But it sounds like having a good time to you is following your curiosity. BRAND: Yeah, I think that's right. And, you know, what are the interesting problems? That question turns out to keep some very easily bored people fascinated. ZOMORODI: Stewart, I've read that people, young entrepreneurs especially, love to ask your advice, and I've heard that they ask you one particular question. How do you stay so creative? Is that true? Is that the No. 1 question you get asked? BRAND: No. It's mostly about, you know, how did that work back in the day in the Bay Area in the '60s and '70s and '80s? And is it working now? And how do you get the best benefit of the Bay Area? And the thing I point out is San Francisco area is a little different than Los Angeles or New York in the sense that people don't go to San Francisco to succeed, or at least not most of the time. They go to San Francisco to be happy. And that keeps them loose enough, focusing enough on trying stuff - low threshold of success and comfort in, you know, moving on, changing communities, changing disciplines that you work in, having a good time. ZOMORODI: So not to end on a morbid note, but you do think a lot about the future, Stewart. May I ask what you want to happen after your death? Do you want to be an AI version of yourself to - I don't know - live on in the metaverse? Or are you going to have your body cryogenically frozen so we can de-extinct you (laughter)? BRAND: Oh, God. ZOMORODI: Like, what are you going to do? BRAND: I have picked a nice place to be planted, and I like the idea of being planted intact. It's one of those sort of semi-organic graveyards where they - you don't have yourself one approved crypt. You have some kind of wood or otherwise biodegradable coffin. And I'm biodegradable, so I can't imagine doing anything cryogenic. And you never know. ZOMORODI: What if we contribute this conversation to, like, the database that's compiling everything you've ever said so that they could make an AI version of you? BRAND: Oh, gosh. You know, anybody who wants to become a scholar of that. . . (LAUGHTER) BRAND: And, you know, it gives them freedom. They can pick and choose whichever version of the character. They pick the setting they want. ZOMORODI: Oh, OK. So, like, we could just hang out with 1966 Stewart. BRAND: Yeah, sure. Why not? ZOMORODI: There's a book that's an extremely comprehensive biography of your life. There's a documentary coming out - also very comprehensive. There is something about you that fascinates people, Stewart. And I guess I'm wondering, if you had to pick one, what do you hope your biggest legacy is? BRAND: It's hard to know. You know, legacies have their own life. One of the things I was surprised by in biographies is - I hadn't really paid attention to it, but reviews of biographies are usually a review of the subject more than the book itself. And so, boy, have I been getting mixed reviews out there, from, pay no attention to this Zen playboy, to, you know, here's the key to understanding the last 50 years. They're all looking at the same book. So. . . ZOMORODI: You're complicated, Stewart. BRAND: No, it's just what people do. So, you know, we held a 50th anniversary of Whole Earth Catalog, and we printed up a T-shirt for people that said, still hungry, still foolish. And I put it on the back of the Whole Earth epilogue in 1973. And what did I mean about it at the time? I was - it's appetite. It's willingness to be ridiculous on the way to something you think might be interesting. But everybody has their own reading, I guess. ZOMORODI: Stewart Brand, thank you so much. BRAND: Well, thank you. This was great. ZOMORODI: Stewart is currently working on his seventh book. It's called \"The Maintenance Of Everything. \" And he's writing about maintaining, well, everything from sailboats to civilizations. And you can see all of his previous TED talks at ted. com. And if you want to learn more about Stewart Brand and all the ideas that we talked about, check out John Markoff's biography \"Whole Earth: The Many Lives Of Stewart Brand\" and the documentary film \"We Are As Gods\" - many thanks to them for their help, too.

RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:  We might take some of those sounds for granted, like a flock of birds on New York's Great Gull Island. (SOUNDBITE OF SEAGULLS CALLING)MARTIN: Other sounds are quite rare. This is from a Japanese village where artisans use massive devices to smash rocks and soil into clay to make pottery. (SOUNDBITE OF CREAKING)METZNER: They're called kara-usu - the size of telephone poles. They're powered by streams. They look like - you know, that bobbing bird toy? They sort of work kind of on the same principle.

I was in Brazil - town called Feira de Santana. The scene was plains - rolling plains, farm country. And I see, oh, wow. There's a group of cowboys - the vaqueros. And I knew that they sang to their cattle when they were herding them. They - it's called the aboyo. But no one had ever recorded them, to the best of my knowledge. Man, I got to tell you; I was in sound man heaven. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED COWBOYS: (Singing in Non-English language). METZNER: The steer which they were herding were longhorn steer. And one of the steer saw me and sort of didn't like what he saw, lowers his head, charges at me full bore. I'm standing there with 14 pounds of equipment. And I'm going, I'm a dead man. I thought for a second, oh, my God; maybe I'll take this Nakamichi 550 and put it in front of me. And then I thought, no, I can't do that. I couldn't even bear the thought of my equipment getting gored. And at the last possible second, one of the cowboys comes nonchalantly trotting up to the cow. He's carrying a stick. And he just taps the steer, and the steer veers off. And, you know, then the cowboy sort of very cool - he's probably seen too many Marlboro Man ads - you know, he just tips his hat and runs off.

I want them to be heard. And I've talked to the library. Can we find ways of curating these sounds? You know, you could go to a museum and see Diane Arbus' photographs. You can see Rene Magritte's paintings. Why not soundscapes? They are every bit as much of an art form.

ALINA SELYUKH, BYLINE: It's hard to overstate the wild ride of Bed Bath & Beyond on Wall Street. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Value spiked by nearly 300%. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: A more than 40% drop in one day. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: Absolutely plunging as it shuts 150 stores, slashes its workforce. SELYUKH: The rise and crash of a meme stock - people on Reddit and YouTube pumped money into Bed Bath this summer after their idol, activist investor Ryan Cohen, bought a stake in the company until suddenly he sold it, got out. Cue legal turmoil, then more shocking news - the death of the chain's chief financial officer days after he announced store closures, job cuts and financing for a turnaround. So what's next? JAIME KATZ: There are a lot more questions than answers now. SELYUKH: Jaime Katz is an analyst at Morningstar. KATZ: You have an interim CEO. You have an interim CFO. The COO has been relieved of his duties. SELYUKH: Chaos is a fairly recent state of being for Bed Bath & Beyond. Until recent years, the company seemed relatively steady, hoovering up competitors. In 2018, it had over 1,500 stores with a secret weapon that shoppers loved - and no, not the 20% off coupon. Unlike most retailers, Bed Bath let local managers choose what to sell in each store. Former exec Amy Laskin remembers one Miami visit. AMY LASKIN: Right in the front, when you walk in the doors, there's this wild, brightly colored, Disney-themed stuff. It was so Miami. And I thought, this will never sell anywhere else. SELYUKH: Laskin was a content marketing executive in the 2010s. This was a time of existential change. Mobile shopping was exploding. Amazon, Target, Wayfair put up formidable competition. Bed Bath & Beyond still searched for its online identity. LASKIN: I would go into one meeting, and it would be, we need to be about home, more furniture. The next conversation would be, we need to be more competitive with Amazon. We need to be the destination with everything. And that's where those crazy new categories of merchandise came in. SELYUKH: Like diamond jewelry for the wedding registry. Bed Bath & Beyond whipped up a dizzying website, but it kept running ads promoting physical stores. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: Oh, this is called offline shopping. It's like online shopping, but in real life. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #5: Wait, so I can touch anything before I buy? SELYUKH: This ad is from 2019, a year before the pandemic. Sales were dropping. A series of turnarounds began. A new CEO had a big idea. Bed Bath would declutter and try a strategy that worked like a charm at Target - introduce its own brands. What took Target years Bed Bath was trying to do in months during the pandemic. Shoppers weren't sold on the unfamiliar labels, says analyst Katz. KATZ: This might have been a different story had people gone into the stores and seen the new brands. SELYUKH: But this was time to rake in online sales. In fact, it was a boon for home goods - kitchen gadgets, air fryers, cozy blankets. Bed Bath & Beyond missed out. Its turnaround rush made the supply chain problems worse, leaving shelves empty. It was a bit slow on the curbside pickup, its website still a clunker. Now the new new leadership is racing to bring back the national brands, hoping for a holiday season miracle.

It's globally accessible, offers end-to-end encryption for chats and video calls, and it now claims over 700 million users. But an article in Wired says that the app has now become a breeding ground for major doxxing attacks all around the world. Peter Guest wrote that story and joins us now to explain. Welcome. PETER GUEST: Hi there. CHANG: Hi. OK. So can we just first define doxxing? Like, how would you put it? GUEST: So doxxing is just the practice of sharing someone's private information on the internet - so their home address, their workplace, their phone number, some identifying information - usually as a way to intimidate them. CHANG: And can you explain why this works so well on Telegram specifically? GUEST: So Telegram, as you said at the top of the show, is something between a messaging app and a social media platform. It means that you can move quite seamlessly from sending and receiving anonymous private messages to then broadcasting them via channels. So anyone can set up a channel, and those can have tens, hundreds of thousands of followers. So what you can do on Telegram - if I run a big channel, I can use my followers to crowdsource information about somebody that I want to expose. They can send me information anonymously. I can collect that information, cross-reference it, then broadcast it right back into the same channel to hundreds of thousands of users. CHANG: And you mention a lot of different specific examples of these doxxing attacks taking place all around the world in your story. Can you tell us about one example in particular? GUEST: So the example that really drew me in to the story was Myanmar, where there was a military coup d'etat in February 2021. And since then, the military junta that runs that country has pursued its perceived enemies, and that's included using informants online to identify and expose people. That's been going on for a while, but it really escalated this year. So there was a silent strike. Effectively, businesses and individuals said, we'll stay home. We'll shut. We'll leave the streets deserted. And in advance of that, several military-supporting Telegram channels started asking their followers to identify businesses and individuals who said they were going to join the strike. So these got posted in these channels, addresses and names. And within hours, in some cases, the premises were raided by police. People were arrested. They ended up in jail. CHANG: Wow. Well, I'm curious. What's been Telegram's response to your reporting so far? GUEST: So Telegram is a fairly secretive company and hasn't historically engaged in any kind of deep way with journalists or civil society. CHANG: They're based in Dubai, correct? GUEST: So their structure is part of the reason why they are so complicated to cover and regulate. So as far as we know, they were founded in Russia. The software was developed in Germany. The headquarters are in Dubai. But the legal registration is in the British Virgin Islands. CHANG: Wow. You know, I'm wondering about the original purpose of Telegram. I can imagine that one of its initial appeals was that it had this ability to protect messages from the eyes of the government. But now it's, in some cases, as you point out, being used as an instrument of the government to intimidate individuals. GUEST: So I think Telegram has become an incredibly consequential platform in authoritarian countries. It has been used by people in those states to avoid censorship and to organize protest movements. You know, it's infuriated the censors in Russia for years. And that's a great thing. But I guess that's perhaps why there's a little bit of a sense of betrayal here that it's become an enormously dangerous place and a venue for these abuses. And certainly from the side of activists, they feel like Telegram is not supporting them. It's not listening to them, and it's not doing anything to make these spaces safer for them. CHANG: Right. That was Peter Guest with his reporting that was recently published for Wired. Thank you very much for joining us today. GUEST: Thanks for having me.

GUEST: So the example that really drew me in to the story was Myanmar, where there was a military coup d'etat in February 2021. And since then, the military junta that runs that country has pursued its perceived enemies, and that's included using informants online to identify and expose people. That's been going on for a while, but it really escalated this year. So there was a silent strike. Effectively, businesses and individuals said, we'll stay home. We'll shut. We'll leave the streets deserted. And in advance of that, several military-supporting Telegram channels started asking their followers to identify businesses and individuals who said they were going to join the strike. So these got posted in these channels, addresses and names. And within hours, in some cases, the premises were raided by police. People were arrested. They ended up in jail. CHANG: Wow. Well, I'm curious. What's been Telegram's response to your reporting so far? GUEST: So Telegram is a fairly secretive company and hasn't historically engaged in any kind of deep way with journalists or civil society. CHANG: They're based in Dubai, correct? GUEST: So their structure is part of the reason why they are so complicated to cover and regulate. So as far as we know, they were founded in Russia. The software was developed in Germany. The headquarters are in Dubai. But the legal registration is in the British Virgin Islands. CHANG: Wow. You know, I'm wondering about the original purpose of Telegram. I can imagine that one of its initial appeals was that it had this ability to protect messages from the eyes of the government. But now it's, in some cases, as you point out, being used as an instrument of the government to intimidate individuals. GUEST: So I think Telegram has become an incredibly consequential platform in authoritarian countries. It has been used by people in those states to avoid censorship and to organize protest movements. You know, it's infuriated the censors in Russia for years. And that's a great thing. But I guess that's perhaps why there's a little bit of a sense of betrayal here that it's become an enormously dangerous place and a venue for these abuses. And certainly from the side of activists, they feel like Telegram is not supporting them. It's not listening to them, and it's not doing anything to make these spaces safer for them. CHANG: Right. That was Peter Guest with his reporting that was recently published for Wired. Thank you very much for joining us today. GUEST: Thanks for having me.

(SOUNDBITE OF COIN SPINNING)AMANDA ARONCZYK, HOST:  One Sunday morning in April, reporter Jacob Lorinc was sitting at his home in Toronto when he looked down at his phone. JACOB LORINC: I got a text from my friend saying, hey, I saw something strange at Freshii. You should go check it out. KENNY MALONE, HOST:  Freshii is a fast-food chain that serves salads and burritos and smoothies with avocado blended into them, if that's your thing. And these restaurants, they're everywhere in Toronto. Like, you take five steps, another Freshii, five more steps, Freshii - two Freshiis. ARONCZYK: Jacob says it's the kind of place people feel pretty warmly about. LORINC: There are a lot of people who will just randomly tweet pictures of their salad bowls from Freshii, and they'll just caption it with things like, this is a great salad bowl. ARONCZYK: So he decides he will go to this particular Freshii that his friend texted him about. And when he walks in, he immediately notices something a little odd. LORINC: So there's nobody there. MALONE: As in, like, nobody there to take an order or anything. LORINC: And when I get to the counter, there's a little screen that is taped, I think, to the cash register. And it took me by surprise, but it suddenly lit up, and there was a face on the other side of the screen. MALONE: It is a real, live human face, from the shoulders up, on a tablet-sized screen. And that person says something like, hello, welcome to Freshii. Can I take your order? LORINC: And this catches me off guard because I'm waiting for somebody to walk out from the back of the restaurant to come serve me. ARONCZYK: But no one comes out. So Jacob orders a raspberry smoothie and pays the person on the screen with his debit card. MALONE: And, you know, Jacob is a reporter, and so he's thinking to himself, like, this cashier-on-the-screen thing, like, I've never seen this before. Maybe this is a story. And so he asks that person, where exactly are you? LORINC: When I asked that, the cashier sort of paused for a second and chuckled. And she said, you know, most people would assume that we're in Toronto, but I'm actually in Nicaragua. ARONCZYK: She's in Nicaragua? LORINC: In Nicaragua. ARONCZYK: She is, like, thousands of miles away. LORINC: Yeah. If we can use a Canadian metric here. . . ARONCZYK: Sure. LORINC: . . . She's 6,000 kilometers away. (SOUNDBITE OF HUGH ROBERT EDWIN WILKINSON'S \"HIP TO THE HUSTLE\")ARONCZYK: A fast-food restaurant in Toronto had outsourced and offshored their cashier job to a worker in Nicaragua. Hello, and welcome to PLANET MONEY. I'm Amanda Aronczyk. MALONE: I'm Kenny Malone. You know, the food services industry took this massive hit during the pandemic, particularly in places with strict lockdowns. People avoided restaurants. Business dried up. And when restaurants came back, it had gotten a lot harder for employers to find workers. ARONCZYK: Today on the show, we head to Toronto where, to try to survive, some restaurants have pivoted to some surprising solutions. MALONE: There will be robot baristas, pizza ATMs, and a cashier who telecommutes from thousands of kilometers away. (SOUNDBITE OF HUGH ROBERT EDWIN WILKINSON'S \"HIP TO THE HUSTLE\")ARONCZYK: Did you struggle with the word kilometer? MALONE: I just don't say it very often yet. ARONCZYK: (Laughter) You want to try again? MALONE: Can I say K's? Is that what we say, K's? ARONCZYK: No. MALONE: Thousands of K's? ARONCZYK: No, no. Nobody says that. (SOUNDBITE OF HUGH ROBERT EDWIN WILKINSON'S \"HIP TO THE HUSTLE\")ARONCZYK: OK, so before we go to Freshii to meet the cashier on a screen, I asked Kenny to come meet up with me in downtown Toronto. MALONE: I see Amanda. ARONCZYK: Kenny Malone. MALONE: What's up? ARONCZYK: Welcome to Toronto. MALONE: It's Canada. MALONE: Now, Amanda, you told me that you were going to show me around. ARONCZYK: And this is my hometown. So I made, like, a list of places for us to go. MALONE: Have you ever been to any of these? ARONCZYK: I've never been to any of these. MALONE: This is the best hometown tour ever. ARONCZYK: Yes, basically. . . This was not a come-see-my-hometown tour, but a tour that I'm going to call where-did-all-the-food-workers-go tour? MALONE: Right. Because over the last couple of years, the food service industry has undergone a COVID shock. And this has given folks in the business some time for self-reflection, maybe a little panic. And one of the things that keeps these businesses up at night is the cost of labor. ARONCZYK: And like in a lot of industries, if you don't want to pay higher hourly wages, then there are two shiny-looking options for lowering labor costs - offshoring jobs or automating them. And you can really see this in Toronto, which is, like, kind of a foodie town in a country known for being a good test market. MALONE: You know, yes, Canadians, they're a lot like us. ARONCZYK: Yes, we are. So let's start with the robots. We were off to see not just the self-checkout kiosks that you can use at McDonald's, but the more unusual versions. Cue up the montage music. (SOUNDBITE OF BENJAMIN JAMES PARSONS' \"ARISTOPUPS\")MALONE: All right, here we go. Here we go. ARONCZYK: First up, we're downtown in front of an office building. We're at RC Coffee Robo Cafe. Built into an old storefront is a touch screen and a coffee robot? So we are going to have some robot coffee. MALONE: You mean oil? ARONCZYK: No, I do not mean oil. MALONE: Oh. (LAUGHTER)MALONE: There are zero human workers at this, quote-unquote, \"robo cafe. \" To the left of the touch screen, though, you can see a window into a small room. ARONCZYK: OK, so here you can see the robots. MALONE: Oh, that's the - whoa. Wait a - what? OK. There is a considerable robot arm - a robot arm that I think should be doing some kind of cancer research. . . ARONCZYK: What do you think it's doing? MALONE: . . . But instead it's making my flat white. (LAUGHTER)ARONCZYK: A little elevator deposits the flat white. Kenny also orders a cortado. Are you going to drink both of these? MALONE: Yes. ARONCZYK: You going to be all right? MALONE: I'll be fine. ARONCZYK: All right, then - caffeinated Kenny. (SOUNDBITE OF BENJAMIN JAMES PARSONS' \"ARISTOPUPS\")ARONCZYK: Next stop, we head about 20 blocks south for lunch. OK, here we go. PizzaForno 24/7 Automated Pizzeria is here. MALONE: Is it a pizza ATM? ARONCZYK: It's a pizza ATM. MALONE: Oh, yeah. ARONCZYK: (Laughter). MALONE: We pick Hawaiian pizza on the old touch screen, says it'll be three minutes. ARONCZYK: Now, while I pay, a still fairly caffeinated Kenny walks around the corner to watch through a window as a robot-y thing grabs a preassembled artisanal pizza, slides it in the oven. MALONE: Oh, look, look. Amanda, Amanda, Amanda. ARONCZYK: I'm typing in my name. MALONE: Amanda. ARONCZYK: And he's going to go - oh, shoot. MALONE: It grabbed a pizza. ARONCZYK: I spelled my own name wrong again. MALONE: It did grab our pizza. Finally, our pizza pops out of a little slot window thing. ARONCZYK: Here it is. Look at that. Oh, it's hot. Ow. MALONE: Yeah. Amanda, we just watched it in an oven. ARONCZYK: It was hot, and it was not cut into slices. MALONE: Yeah. They don't want the robots to have knives yet. ARONCZYK: (Laughter). MALONE: They're like, no, no. You can make our pizza, but no cutting. It turns out, there was a knife dispenser. We didn't find it and had to rip up the pizza with our hands. ARONCZYK: After the pizza, groceries - a big chain store called Sobeys with a self-checkout inside the shopping cart. MALONE: It looks like - so where normally a child would sit in a shopping cart. . . ARONCZYK: Yes. MALONE: . . . There's instead, like, a checkout screen, a credit card machine and a scanner. ARONCZYK: Whatever you want to buy you just scan it, toss it in the cart. MALONE: Ooh, look, look - Canadian chocolate chip cookies, soft and warm. Ooh, maple cookies. ARONCZYK: All right. MALONE: OK, here you go. ARONCZYK: OK. MALONE: Shopping cart malfunctions immediately. ARONCZYK: OK. It looks like you took an item out of your cart while the scale was stabilizing. Put it back. MALONE: Oh, my God. ARONCZYK: We did. MALONE: Why is Canada doing this? ARONCZYK: Don't touch the cart. The cart is supposed to weigh everything, but it doesn't work. MALONE: What? ARONCZYK: It thinks you removed an item. MALONE: No. I didn't do anything. ARONCZYK: Which makes Kenny kind of angry. MALONE: I hate this cart so much. ARONCZYK: (Laughter) Oh, no. But we bought groceries, never talked to a single human. MALONE: Oh, man. ARONCZYK: We did it. We bought groceries. MALONE: Yeah. That sucked so bad. Now, robot coffee and ATM pizza - you can see what these restaurant owners are thinking. No need to pay for a barista or a pizza slicer, clearly, or cashiers. ARONCZYK: And these places were, I don't know, fine. It was a little annoying that we had to figure out how to cut our own pizza. There is no way to get exactly 1 1/2 packs of sugar in my coffee, which is how I like my coffee. MALONE: Amanda's very specific about her coffee. ARONCZYK: (Laughter) I am. But the coffee itself was good. And I don't need to talk to a human while I'm pre-coffee - honestly, probably best that I don't. And I could totally see running by the pizza ATM on my way home so I could avoid cooking. But there is a whole spectrum of being pleased to annoyed by automation. And there's kind of a line that you don't want to cross because you might alienate customers. MALONE: Because, look - I mean, the thing about the self-checkout shopping cart is that it is not removing a human from the process. A human still had to scan the items - us. We had to scan the items, except we weren't paid to do it. ARONCZYK: There's actually research on self-checkout from a couple economists at MIT. They say that, of course, automation can be positive. It can make workers more productive. Like, think of an ATM at a bank. The ATM meant that the tellers could do more complicated jobs than just handing out 20s. But the economists argue that self-checkouts are not like ATMs at the bank. They don't actually boost productivity because someone is still doing the work. Kenny, they call these so-so technologies. MALONE: Like, eh. Like, eh technologies. Yeah. ARONCZYK: Yeah. Not great. MALONE: And that was my experience. It was so-so - bad - so, so bad. ARONCZYK: I, for one, was done with trying to figure out a bunch of touch screens, navigating all these menus, and I was ready to talk to some actual live human beings again. So next day, I headed to Freshii, the restaurant with the cashier on the screen. OK, so I'm at the Freshii in Rosedale, and I'm walking in. Here I go. It's tidy inside. It's got these light wood panels. There are plants that amazingly appear to be alive. It's kind of classy. And just as Jacob, the reporter in Toronto, described, as I approach the counter, a screen blinks on. I see a young woman with long, dark hair. And behind her is, like, one of those Zoom backgrounds. And it says Freshii, Freshii, Freshii, Freshii. CARLA: Hi. Welcome to Freshii. What can I get for you? ARONCZYK: What do you recommend? What's popular? CARLA: Well, the Oaxaca Bowl is popular, also, the Buddha's Satay Bowl. ARONCZYK: Oh, yeah, the Oaxaca Bowl sounds good. So what's a smoothie bowl? CARLA: Well, it's a smoothie in a bowl. ARONCZYK: (Laughter). MALONE: Amanda, context clues, context clues. Come on. ARONCZYK: (Laughter) Yeah. I missed that one. Anyway, I asked the cashier a few questions. Her name is Carla. She's a college student in Santa Cruz, Bolivia, 7,000 kilometers from the Freshii. And she works in, I guess you'd call it, a video call center with about 10 other people who will all politely explain what a smoothie bowl is if you ask. Have you ever tried the smoothie bowl? CARLA: No. I'm in another country, so I can't try them. But since I know the ingredients, I try to make it here. ARONCZYK: What have you succeeded at making? CARLA: Oh, well, the most easy one. It's the Strawberrii Banana smoothie - so that. ARONCZYK: Are there some ingredients that you could not get? CARLA: Well, no, not to get, but there's some ingredients that I wouldn't try, like the Freshii Green. Here it's not coming out that we put avocado in a smoothie, so I wouldn't try that. ARONCZYK: So this is the argument for having a person instead of a robot. Carla can answer my questions, even if she hasn't tried the food. If I want my beet slaw in the shape of the letter A, she can make that happen. And she's funny. The self-checkout shopping cart - not so funny. MALONE: No, zero funny. That said, when people first heard about this virtual cashier system being tried out at the Freshii, they did not like the sound of it. After the break, the backlash against the Freshii virtual cashier. (SOUNDBITE OF DAVID BALUTEAU'S \"WHAT WE WANT\")ARONCZYK: Hey. It's Amanda Aronczyk. Don't miss our next episode for subscribers to Planet Money+. We are talking about our first jobs in journalism - first stories, the first thing we do when we start working on a new episode. It is another edition of our behind-the-scenes segment, Five Firsts. That's out Monday. Subscribe to hear it at the link in our episode notes. In April, after Jacob first saw the virtual cashier, he wrote an article about it for the Toronto Star, and he was surprised at how the article took off. LORINC: Really, tons of people started sharing it and reading it. And on our analytics system, we saw the numbers really shoot up on that story. You know, tons and tons of people were reading it. ARONCZYK: OK. And so people are passing around your article. And are they like, wow, this is really innovative and exciting; this is so great? LORINC: No. They're really mad - like, really, really mad. ARONCZYK: Because of the part of Jacob's story that basically said Freshii had taken Canadian jobs and outsourced them to workers who are making much less than Canadian minimum wage. MALONE: It became one of those giant internet freakouts, where everybody is, like, retweeting the article, firing off their angriest, hottest takes. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Extremely disappointing, Freshii. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: And even worse, exploitative. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: This is a dystopia I hadn't even considered before. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Stop outsourcing. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: Shameful. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Do not eat at Freshii. ARONCZYK: Angry Twitter starts #BoycottFreshii. LORINC: By the mid-afternoon, labor ministers around the country were putting out tweets talking about how disgusted they were with the company. MALONE: One labor minister went so far as to say that Freshii's new cashiers were not even welcome in his province. ARONCZYK: Outsourcing and offshoring - very controversial. Some people argue that when companies choose this option, they are prioritizing profits over paying a living wage or paying taxes or protecting workers. Freshii decided that their best course of action was to just keep their head down - basically say nothing - and wait for the outrage to pass, which it did. There was no big boycott. MALONE: Then a couple of weeks after the article came out, the CEO of Freshii stepped down, and he spun that entire virtual cashier idea off into its own company. He and his co-founders named that company Percy. ARONCZYK: One of those co-founders, Angela Argo, says that the timing of the article was not great. ANGELA ARGO: We had not even launched as a brand. Like, there was no marketing. We were in stealth mode. This story broke and forced us to go public, but we still weren't at the point where we wanted to have conversations like this, talking about Percy. It was so new. LORINC: At that point, the company was so focused on the technology and the logistics that they hadn't thought much about the optics of, you know, remote workers on little screens in restaurants. ARGO: The backlash was really surprising and shocking for us. ARONCZYK: Why were you surprised? ARGO: I mean, we thought this was the most boring concept ever. We - literally we said, this is so boring. We're just creating a cashier. No one is going to care. It's solving a really big problem. So business owners are going to care. But everyone's used to Zoom. We've done weddings, funerals, doctors appointments on Zoom. We get it. So we were very shocked when the backlash came. MALONE: And besides, Angela says, it's not like their company had invented outsourcing. ARGO: When we first saw the articles posted about the wages we were paying and stealing American - or Canadian - labor, the first thing that came to our mind was, this is probably very hypocritical. ARONCZYK: She figures, Toronto Star - they probably have a number that customers can call. ARGO: We called the Toronto Star customer support, and they were in India. And again, that's no problem. But it's a problem when you make us bad for it and you don't acknowledge that you were doing it. MALONE: Rohit Verma, a business professor at Cornell University, says ordering from one of these virtual cashiers may feel different from calling a call center, but they're just the crest of a wave that has been rolling in for decades. ROHIT VERMA: So the example you are giving is not unique. Actually, it's happening for quite some time. ARONCZYK: Rohit says that of course this started with manufacturing. Companies found it so profitable to offshore manufacturing jobs that outsourcing, along with automation, transformed our economy from being a manufacturing-based economy to a service-based one. VERMA: Very few people in U. S. right now are employed in either factories or in agriculture. It's actually between 10-20%. Eighty percent or so are employed in services. In other words, all of us - basically, we serve each other. MALONE: Now, services like hospitality or health care or education - these turn out to be a lot harder to outsource than manufacturing jobs. Like, you know, how does a plumber in Beijing fix the leaky pipes in your house in Dallas? Or how would a babysitter in Paris take care of your kid in Toledo? ARONCZYK: Of course, some services have been outsourced. Take customer service. A couple of big things happened to make that possible. The first is something Rohit calls the manufacturization (ph) of services. VERMA: It basically means that you train a group of individual to do a small portion of a job, but do really, really well. MALONE: Yeah. The same way a factory worker might only attach widget A to widget B all day long - A-to-B, A-to-B, A-to-B - a call center might also break down the job. So maybe there's one person who handles canceling subscriptions. A different person handles signing up new customers. All of this makes it easier to centralize these tasks in a remote call center and then scale all of that up. ARONCZYK: Another major development was technology. Go back to the 1960s. It was super hard to make international phone calls. Connections were so limited that only 138 conversations could go between the U. S. and Europe at any given time. MALONE: That was it, 138. And it wasn't until the 1990s that there were enough fiber-optic cables to start to solve this problem. And then, all of a sudden, companies could make enough simultaneous - and cheap - phone calls from the U. S. to India or Ireland or Jamaica to then open an overseas call center. ARONCZYK: A couple of more decades pass. Computing gets faster. The world wide web shows up. And each new technology makes it possible to outsource even more services. VERMA: What has happened in the recent year is that the bandwidth and the ability to compress video and send information quickly has become cheap and very fast. MALONE: And next thing you know, a reporter in Toronto shows up to order a Oaxaca Bowl from Carla, a woman on a screen, in Santa Cruz, Bolivia. ARONCZYK: The reality is this - a lot of the decision making over which jobs get outsourced has always been about more than just the economics or the politics of it. As important - do we have the technology to make this happen? Yes or no? MALONE: And now for virtual cashiers, the answer is clearly yes. Angela, one of the co-founders of Percy, says that she's been getting a lot of interested calls from the restaurant industry. ARONCZYK: So how many Percys are in Toronto? ARGO: In Toronto specifically, from the outset of when we started to about five months in, we're at about 20 locations in Toronto. And we are adding 3 to 6 Percy locations a week across the U. S. and Canada. MALONE: Angela says that, at the moment, they have about a hundred virtual cashiers working from video call centers in Bolivia, Nicaragua, Pakistan, with another one opening soon in the Philippines. ARONCZYK: And while restaurants seem to be eager to try this out, for now, the customer experience of it is kind of weird, kind of new. Carla, the virtual cashier - she and I were both still trying to figure it out. I'm going to wait my bowl. CARLA: Have a great day. ARONCZYK: Thank you. You too. MALONE: Yeah. And now, obviously, Carla could not make Amanda's Oaxaca Bowl remotely. So then a real live, in-person person did have to come out from the back of the restaurant to assemble the bowl. ARONCZYK: And while that was happening, Carla was finishing up her cashiering part. So she and I just kind of stood around and waited. Like, should we keep chatting? Do I pretend she's not there, walk away? When I walk away, will the screen go dark? Do you know? CARLA: Oh. Do you want to see? ARONCZYK: Yeah. What happens? CARLA: OK. You can go to a beverage. ARONCZYK: OK. I'll be right back. I'm going to get a beverage. CARLA: OK. OK. ARONCZYK: I walk about 10 feet away and casually peruse the lemonades, and when I look back, Carla's gone. I see. So you have a way of disappearing so you can have a little privacy if you need a moment. CARLA: Yeah. I only disappear. Yeah. And I don't want them to feel observed. So sometimes when I see they're awkward with the situation, I just look to another place, or I just disappear. ARONCZYK: Carla only really needs to be there for this one discrete part of the transaction - taking my order and taking my money. When she's done, there's not really that much else she can do. She can't grab my napkins or put my Oaxaca Bowl in a bag. But maybe in that slightly awkward pause, she could go up here at Chipotle or Burger King or Walmart. Who knows where she could go?

ARONCZYK: And this is my hometown. So I made, like, a list of places for us to go. MALONE: Have you ever been to any of these? ARONCZYK: I've never been to any of these. MALONE: This is the best hometown tour ever. ARONCZYK: Yes, basically. . . This was not a come-see-my-hometown tour, but a tour that I'm going to call where-did-all-the-food-workers-go tour? MALONE: Right. Because over the last couple of years, the food service industry has undergone a COVID shock. And this has given folks in the business some time for self-reflection, maybe a little panic. And one of the things that keeps these businesses up at night is the cost of labor. ARONCZYK: And like in a lot of industries, if you don't want to pay higher hourly wages, then there are two shiny-looking options for lowering labor costs - offshoring jobs or automating them. And you can really see this in Toronto, which is, like, kind of a foodie town in a country known for being a good test market. MALONE: You know, yes, Canadians, they're a lot like us. ARONCZYK: Yes, we are. So let's start with the robots. We were off to see not just the self-checkout kiosks that you can use at McDonald's, but the more unusual versions. Cue up the montage music. (SOUNDBITE OF BENJAMIN JAMES PARSONS' \"ARISTOPUPS\") MALONE: All right, here we go. Here we go. ARONCZYK: First up, we're downtown in front of an office building. We're at RC Coffee Robo Cafe. Built into an old storefront is a touch screen and a coffee robot? So we are going to have some robot coffee. MALONE: You mean oil? ARONCZYK: No, I do not mean oil. MALONE: Oh. (LAUGHTER) MALONE: There are zero human workers at this, quote-unquote, \"robo cafe. \" To the left of the touch screen, though, you can see a window into a small room. ARONCZYK: OK, so here you can see the robots. MALONE: Oh, that's the - whoa. Wait a - what? OK. There is a considerable robot arm - a robot arm that I think should be doing some kind of cancer research. . . ARONCZYK: What do you think it's doing? MALONE: . . . But instead it's making my flat white. (LAUGHTER) ARONCZYK: A little elevator deposits the flat white. Kenny also orders a cortado. Are you going to drink both of these? MALONE: Yes. ARONCZYK: You going to be all right? MALONE: I'll be fine. ARONCZYK: All right, then - caffeinated Kenny. (SOUNDBITE OF BENJAMIN JAMES PARSONS' \"ARISTOPUPS\") ARONCZYK: Next stop, we head about 20 blocks south for lunch. OK, here we go. PizzaForno 24/7 Automated Pizzeria is here. MALONE: Is it a pizza ATM? ARONCZYK: It's a pizza ATM. MALONE: Oh, yeah. ARONCZYK: (Laughter). MALONE: We pick Hawaiian pizza on the old touch screen, says it'll be three minutes. ARONCZYK: Now, while I pay, a still fairly caffeinated Kenny walks around the corner to watch through a window as a robot-y thing grabs a preassembled artisanal pizza, slides it in the oven. MALONE: Oh, look, look. Amanda, Amanda, Amanda. ARONCZYK: I'm typing in my name. MALONE: Amanda. ARONCZYK: And he's going to go - oh, shoot. MALONE: It grabbed a pizza. ARONCZYK: I spelled my own name wrong again. MALONE: It did grab our pizza. Finally, our pizza pops out of a little slot window thing. ARONCZYK: Here it is. Look at that. Oh, it's hot. Ow. MALONE: Yeah. Amanda, we just watched it in an oven. ARONCZYK: It was hot, and it was not cut into slices. MALONE: Yeah. They don't want the robots to have knives yet. ARONCZYK: (Laughter). MALONE: They're like, no, no. You can make our pizza, but no cutting. It turns out, there was a knife dispenser. We didn't find it and had to rip up the pizza with our hands. ARONCZYK: After the pizza, groceries - a big chain store called Sobeys with a self-checkout inside the shopping cart. MALONE: It looks like - so where normally a child would sit in a shopping cart. . . ARONCZYK: Yes. MALONE: . . . There's instead, like, a checkout screen, a credit card machine and a scanner. ARONCZYK: Whatever you want to buy you just scan it, toss it in the cart. MALONE: Ooh, look, look - Canadian chocolate chip cookies, soft and warm. Ooh, maple cookies. ARONCZYK: All right. MALONE: OK, here you go. ARONCZYK: OK. MALONE: Shopping cart malfunctions immediately. ARONCZYK: OK. It looks like you took an item out of your cart while the scale was stabilizing. Put it back. MALONE: Oh, my God. ARONCZYK: We did. MALONE: Why is Canada doing this? ARONCZYK: Don't touch the cart. The cart is supposed to weigh everything, but it doesn't work. MALONE: What? ARONCZYK: It thinks you removed an item. MALONE: No. I didn't do anything. ARONCZYK: Which makes Kenny kind of angry. MALONE: I hate this cart so much. ARONCZYK: (Laughter) Oh, no. But we bought groceries, never talked to a single human. MALONE: Oh, man. ARONCZYK: We did it. We bought groceries. MALONE: Yeah. That sucked so bad. Now, robot coffee and ATM pizza - you can see what these restaurant owners are thinking. No need to pay for a barista or a pizza slicer, clearly, or cashiers. ARONCZYK: And these places were, I don't know, fine. It was a little annoying that we had to figure out how to cut our own pizza. There is no way to get exactly 1 1/2 packs of sugar in my coffee, which is how I like my coffee. MALONE: Amanda's very specific about her coffee. ARONCZYK: (Laughter) I am. But the coffee itself was good. And I don't need to talk to a human while I'm pre-coffee - honestly, probably best that I don't. And I could totally see running by the pizza ATM on my way home so I could avoid cooking. But there is a whole spectrum of being pleased to annoyed by automation. And there's kind of a line that you don't want to cross because you might alienate customers. MALONE: Because, look - I mean, the thing about the self-checkout shopping cart is that it is not removing a human from the process. A human still had to scan the items - us. We had to scan the items, except we weren't paid to do it. ARONCZYK: There's actually research on self-checkout from a couple economists at MIT. They say that, of course, automation can be positive. It can make workers more productive. Like, think of an ATM at a bank. The ATM meant that the tellers could do more complicated jobs than just handing out 20s. But the economists argue that self-checkouts are not like ATMs at the bank. They don't actually boost productivity because someone is still doing the work. Kenny, they call these so-so technologies. MALONE: Like, eh. Like, eh technologies. Yeah. ARONCZYK: Yeah. Not great. MALONE: And that was my experience. It was so-so - bad - so, so bad. ARONCZYK: I, for one, was done with trying to figure out a bunch of touch screens, navigating all these menus, and I was ready to talk to some actual live human beings again. So next day, I headed to Freshii, the restaurant with the cashier on the screen. OK, so I'm at the Freshii in Rosedale, and I'm walking in. Here I go. It's tidy inside. It's got these light wood panels. There are plants that amazingly appear to be alive. It's kind of classy. And just as Jacob, the reporter in Toronto, described, as I approach the counter, a screen blinks on. I see a young woman with long, dark hair. And behind her is, like, one of those Zoom backgrounds. And it says Freshii, Freshii, Freshii, Freshii. CARLA: Hi. Welcome to Freshii. What can I get for you? ARONCZYK: What do you recommend? What's popular? CARLA: Well, the Oaxaca Bowl is popular, also, the Buddha's Satay Bowl. ARONCZYK: Oh, yeah, the Oaxaca Bowl sounds good. So what's a smoothie bowl? CARLA: Well, it's a smoothie in a bowl. ARONCZYK: (Laughter). MALONE: Amanda, context clues, context clues. Come on. ARONCZYK: (Laughter) Yeah. I missed that one. Anyway, I asked the cashier a few questions. Her name is Carla. She's a college student in Santa Cruz, Bolivia, 7,000 kilometers from the Freshii. And she works in, I guess you'd call it, a video call center with about 10 other people who will all politely explain what a smoothie bowl is if you ask. Have you ever tried the smoothie bowl? CARLA: No. I'm in another country, so I can't try them. But since I know the ingredients, I try to make it here. ARONCZYK: What have you succeeded at making? CARLA: Oh, well, the most easy one. It's the Strawberrii Banana smoothie - so that. ARONCZYK: Are there some ingredients that you could not get? CARLA: Well, no, not to get, but there's some ingredients that I wouldn't try, like the Freshii Green. Here it's not coming out that we put avocado in a smoothie, so I wouldn't try that. ARONCZYK: So this is the argument for having a person instead of a robot. Carla can answer my questions, even if she hasn't tried the food. If I want my beet slaw in the shape of the letter A, she can make that happen. And she's funny. The self-checkout shopping cart - not so funny. MALONE: No, zero funny. That said, when people first heard about this virtual cashier system being tried out at the Freshii, they did not like the sound of it. After the break, the backlash against the Freshii virtual cashier. (SOUNDBITE OF DAVID BALUTEAU'S \"WHAT WE WANT\") ARONCZYK: Hey. It's Amanda Aronczyk. Don't miss our next episode for subscribers to Planet Money+. We are talking about our first jobs in journalism - first stories, the first thing we do when we start working on a new episode. It is another edition of our behind-the-scenes segment, Five Firsts. That's out Monday. Subscribe to hear it at the link in our episode notes. In April, after Jacob first saw the virtual cashier, he wrote an article about it for the Toronto Star, and he was surprised at how the article took off. LORINC: Really, tons of people started sharing it and reading it. And on our analytics system, we saw the numbers really shoot up on that story. You know, tons and tons of people were reading it. ARONCZYK: OK. And so people are passing around your article. And are they like, wow, this is really innovative and exciting; this is so great? LORINC: No. They're really mad - like, really, really mad. ARONCZYK: Because of the part of Jacob's story that basically said Freshii had taken Canadian jobs and outsourced them to workers who are making much less than Canadian minimum wage. MALONE: It became one of those giant internet freakouts, where everybody is, like, retweeting the article, firing off their angriest, hottest takes. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Extremely disappointing, Freshii. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: And even worse, exploitative. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: This is a dystopia I hadn't even considered before. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Stop outsourcing. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: Shameful. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Do not eat at Freshii. ARONCZYK: Angry Twitter starts #BoycottFreshii. LORINC: By the mid-afternoon, labor ministers around the country were putting out tweets talking about how disgusted they were with the company. MALONE: One labor minister went so far as to say that Freshii's new cashiers were not even welcome in his province. ARONCZYK: Outsourcing and offshoring - very controversial. Some people argue that when companies choose this option, they are prioritizing profits over paying a living wage or paying taxes or protecting workers. Freshii decided that their best course of action was to just keep their head down - basically say nothing - and wait for the outrage to pass, which it did. There was no big boycott. MALONE: Then a couple of weeks after the article came out, the CEO of Freshii stepped down, and he spun that entire virtual cashier idea off into its own company. He and his co-founders named that company Percy. ARONCZYK: One of those co-founders, Angela Argo, says that the timing of the article was not great. ANGELA ARGO: We had not even launched as a brand. Like, there was no marketing. We were in stealth mode. This story broke and forced us to go public, but we still weren't at the point where we wanted to have conversations like this, talking about Percy. It was so new. LORINC: At that point, the company was so focused on the technology and the logistics that they hadn't thought much about the optics of, you know, remote workers on little screens in restaurants. ARGO: The backlash was really surprising and shocking for us. ARONCZYK: Why were you surprised? ARGO: I mean, we thought this was the most boring concept ever. We - literally we said, this is so boring. We're just creating a cashier. No one is going to care. It's solving a really big problem. So business owners are going to care. But everyone's used to Zoom. We've done weddings, funerals, doctors appointments on Zoom. We get it. So we were very shocked when the backlash came. MALONE: And besides, Angela says, it's not like their company had invented outsourcing. ARGO: When we first saw the articles posted about the wages we were paying and stealing American - or Canadian - labor, the first thing that came to our mind was, this is probably very hypocritical. ARONCZYK: She figures, Toronto Star - they probably have a number that customers can call. ARGO: We called the Toronto Star customer support, and they were in India. And again, that's no problem. But it's a problem when you make us bad for it and you don't acknowledge that you were doing it. MALONE: Rohit Verma, a business professor at Cornell University, says ordering from one of these virtual cashiers may feel different from calling a call center, but they're just the crest of a wave that has been rolling in for decades. ROHIT VERMA: So the example you are giving is not unique. Actually, it's happening for quite some time. ARONCZYK: Rohit says that of course this started with manufacturing. Companies found it so profitable to offshore manufacturing jobs that outsourcing, along with automation, transformed our economy from being a manufacturing-based economy to a service-based one. VERMA: Very few people in U. S. right now are employed in either factories or in agriculture. It's actually between 10-20%. Eighty percent or so are employed in services. In other words, all of us - basically, we serve each other. MALONE: Now, services like hospitality or health care or education - these turn out to be a lot harder to outsource than manufacturing jobs. Like, you know, how does a plumber in Beijing fix the leaky pipes in your house in Dallas? Or how would a babysitter in Paris take care of your kid in Toledo? ARONCZYK: Of course, some services have been outsourced. Take customer service. A couple of big things happened to make that possible. The first is something Rohit calls the manufacturization (ph) of services. VERMA: It basically means that you train a group of individual to do a small portion of a job, but do really, really well. MALONE: Yeah. The same way a factory worker might only attach widget A to widget B all day long - A-to-B, A-to-B, A-to-B - a call center might also break down the job. So maybe there's one person who handles canceling subscriptions. A different person handles signing up new customers. All of this makes it easier to centralize these tasks in a remote call center and then scale all of that up. ARONCZYK: Another major development was technology. Go back to the 1960s. It was super hard to make international phone calls. Connections were so limited that only 138 conversations could go between the U. S. and Europe at any given time. MALONE: That was it, 138. And it wasn't until the 1990s that there were enough fiber-optic cables to start to solve this problem. And then, all of a sudden, companies could make enough simultaneous - and cheap - phone calls from the U. S. to India or Ireland or Jamaica to then open an overseas call center. ARONCZYK: A couple of more decades pass. Computing gets faster. The world wide web shows up. And each new technology makes it possible to outsource even more services. VERMA: What has happened in the recent year is that the bandwidth and the ability to compress video and send information quickly has become cheap and very fast. MALONE: And next thing you know, a reporter in Toronto shows up to order a Oaxaca Bowl from Carla, a woman on a screen, in Santa Cruz, Bolivia. ARONCZYK: The reality is this - a lot of the decision making over which jobs get outsourced has always been about more than just the economics or the politics of it. As important - do we have the technology to make this happen? Yes or no? MALONE: And now for virtual cashiers, the answer is clearly yes. Angela, one of the co-founders of Percy, says that she's been getting a lot of interested calls from the restaurant industry. ARONCZYK: So how many Percys are in Toronto? ARGO: In Toronto specifically, from the outset of when we started to about five months in, we're at about 20 locations in Toronto. And we are adding 3 to 6 Percy locations a week across the U. S. and Canada. MALONE: Angela says that, at the moment, they have about a hundred virtual cashiers working from video call centers in Bolivia, Nicaragua, Pakistan, with another one opening soon in the Philippines. ARONCZYK: And while restaurants seem to be eager to try this out, for now, the customer experience of it is kind of weird, kind of new. Carla, the virtual cashier - she and I were both still trying to figure it out. I'm going to wait my bowl. CARLA: Have a great day. ARONCZYK: Thank you. You too. MALONE: Yeah. And now, obviously, Carla could not make Amanda's Oaxaca Bowl remotely. So then a real live, in-person person did have to come out from the back of the restaurant to assemble the bowl. ARONCZYK: And while that was happening, Carla was finishing up her cashiering part. So she and I just kind of stood around and waited. Like, should we keep chatting? Do I pretend she's not there, walk away? When I walk away, will the screen go dark? Do you know? CARLA: Oh. Do you want to see? ARONCZYK: Yeah. What happens? CARLA: OK. You can go to a beverage. ARONCZYK: OK. I'll be right back. I'm going to get a beverage. CARLA: OK. OK. ARONCZYK: I walk about 10 feet away and casually peruse the lemonades, and when I look back, Carla's gone. I see. So you have a way of disappearing so you can have a little privacy if you need a moment. CARLA: Yeah. I only disappear. Yeah. And I don't want them to feel observed. So sometimes when I see they're awkward with the situation, I just look to another place, or I just disappear. ARONCZYK: Carla only really needs to be there for this one discrete part of the transaction - taking my order and taking my money. When she's done, there's not really that much else she can do. She can't grab my napkins or put my Oaxaca Bowl in a bag. But maybe in that slightly awkward pause, she could go up here at Chipotle or Burger King or Walmart. Who knows where she could go?

A court in Delaware has released a stream of text messages as part of the legal battle over whether Musk has to follow through on the merger agreement he signed to buy Twitter for $44 billion. Joining us for more on where this lawsuit stands is NPR business reporter Raquel Maria Dillon. Good morning, Raquel. RAQUEL MARIA DILLON, BYLINE: Good morning. FADEL: So first, Raquel, tell us why the court would release these text messages. DILLON: They're part of evidence in Twitter's lawsuit against Musk. That case is just a couple weeks from trial, so the legal teams are going back-and-forth, trying to get access to communications and internal documents to prove their arguments. And to be honest, the case has been very technical so far. The Delaware court, where this case was filed, is very staid and by the book 'cause they deal with these corporate cases that are worth more money than you can get your head around. And then the texts dropped yesterday, and suddenly, it's no longer dry and boring. It's like these billionaires are human. They text like the rest of us. FADEL: So what was in them? DILLON: Well, reading the conversations, you can almost see the idea of buying Twitter take shape in Elon Musk's mind. The lawsuit is going to decide if that actually happens - meaning who owns Twitter - and people are interested in the fate of Twitter, 'cause it's so influential, and also curious about Musk because of his business savvy. And here it is on display. He's doing the deals via text message. But if he made a big mistake by signing a binding contract to acquire Twitter, some people are also going to enjoy seeing him squirm. FADEL: OK. So who was he talking to? DILLON: Well, investors, his finance guy, a couple reporters, random people who are interested in Twitter and well-connected enough to have an introduction. To be honest, there is a lot of sucking up; also a few telling exchanges. Jack Dorsey, Twitter's co-founder and former CEO, eggs on Musk a lot. They seem to share ideas about free speech on the platform. Also Musk and Twitter's current CEO, Parag Agrawal, have this momentary bromance. They bond 'cause they're both engineers turned CEOs and have spent time coding in the trenches. And then just a couple days after that interaction by text, they have a falling out - though not via text. Musk is like, I'm out. I'm not on your board. I'm going to take Twitter private. FADEL: Yeah, but these aren't just a few bros texting. These are the world's billionaires texting. What else was in those messages? DILLON: The amount of money rolling around in these text messages is mind-boggling. In one exchange in April, Larry Ellison, who founded Oracle, expressed interest in taking Twitter private. And Musk says, how much? Ellison says, and I quote, \"a billion, or whatever you recommend. \" And Musk asks for $2 billion, and he gets it. So then fast-forward a few months, here we are, almost to a trial that could be a showdown of sorts between a tech executive who likes to make his own rules and a rule-bound business court that decides when to hold people to their promises. At the end of it, Musk could find himself the unwilling owner of a troubled social media company and also out $44 billion. FADEL: Oh, just $44 billion. NPR's Raquel Maria Dillon in San Francisco, thank you so much. DILLON: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF MARLEY CARROLL'S \"SEVEN CROWS\") LEILA FADEL, HOST:   Elon Musk's deal to buy Twitter was hatched via private text messages between the Tesla CEO and a small circle of Silicon Valley's rich and powerful. A court in Delaware has released a stream of text messages as part of the legal battle over whether Musk has to follow through on the merger agreement he signed to buy Twitter for $44 billion. Joining us for more on where this lawsuit stands is NPR business reporter Raquel Maria Dillon. Good morning, Raquel. RAQUEL MARIA DILLON, BYLINE: Good morning. FADEL: So first, Raquel, tell us why the court would release these text messages. DILLON: They're part of evidence in Twitter's lawsuit against Musk. That case is just a couple weeks from trial, so the legal teams are going back-and-forth, trying to get access to communications and internal documents to prove their arguments. And to be honest, the case has been very technical so far. The Delaware court, where this case was filed, is very staid and by the book 'cause they deal with these corporate cases that are worth more money than you can get your head around. And then the texts dropped yesterday, and suddenly, it's no longer dry and boring. It's like these billionaires are human. They text like the rest of us. FADEL: So what was in them? DILLON: Well, reading the conversations, you can almost see the idea of buying Twitter take shape in Elon Musk's mind. The lawsuit is going to decide if that actually happens - meaning who owns Twitter - and people are interested in the fate of Twitter, 'cause it's so influential, and also curious about Musk because of his business savvy. And here it is on display. He's doing the deals via text message. But if he made a big mistake by signing a binding contract to acquire Twitter, some people are also going to enjoy seeing him squirm. FADEL: OK. So who was he talking to? DILLON: Well, investors, his finance guy, a couple reporters, random people who are interested in Twitter and well-connected enough to have an introduction. To be honest, there is a lot of sucking up; also a few telling exchanges. Jack Dorsey, Twitter's co-founder and former CEO, eggs on Musk a lot. They seem to share ideas about free speech on the platform. Also Musk and Twitter's current CEO, Parag Agrawal, have this momentary bromance. They bond 'cause they're both engineers turned CEOs and have spent time coding in the trenches. And then just a couple days after that interaction by text, they have a falling out - though not via text. Musk is like, I'm out. I'm not on your board. I'm going to take Twitter private. FADEL: Yeah, but these aren't just a few bros texting. These are the world's billionaires texting. What else was in those messages? DILLON: The amount of money rolling around in these text messages is mind-boggling. In one exchange in April, Larry Ellison, who founded Oracle, expressed interest in taking Twitter private.

Billionaire Elon Musk seems to have changed his mind again about Twitter, less than two weeks before a high-stakes trial. Twitter sued Musk for trying to back out of a deal to buy the social platform for about $44 billion. There were hearings, dozens of depositions, thousands of pages of discovery. And now, Musk says he is willing to go through with the deal after all. NPR's Raquel Maria Dillon is covering this. Hey there. RAQUEL MARIA DILLON, BYLINE: Hello. KELLY: So hello, whiplash. What do we know about Elon Musk's change of heart? DILLON: Yeah, few details so far. Yesterday, he was tweeting about a peace deal in Ukraine. Today, an about-face, and suddenly he wants to buy Twitter again. We do know that Musk sent a letter to Twitter that said he was willing to go through with the deal. And that means paying $54. 20 a share or about $44 billion. And that seemed like a lowball offer back in April. But then tech stocks had a rough couple of quarters, and now that price is actually a great deal for Twitter. That is why Twitter's stock closed up about 22% today. KELLY: Did this take just everyone by surprise, you by surprise? DILLON: The whole case has been a surprise. I mean, even from the beginning, when Musk first said he was going to buy Twitter, everything that followed has been highly unusual, except maybe to corporate lawyers like Professor Ann Lipton of Tulane University. ANN LIPTON: In some ways, it's the most natural thing in the world. The fact that this has been so unprecedented in a sort of colorful way, you know, kind of makes people forget the legal fundamentals. Cases settle just before they go to trial. They settle just before the top people are deposed. DILLON: Or in this unusual case, just a few days after Musk's private messages were made public. They show how impulsive he was about this acquisition. Also, this offer comes just a couple days before Musk is scheduled to sit for a deposition. In the end, what's surprising is that Musk is now willing to pay the original full price. KELLY: OK. So he says he'll pay the original full price. Twitter wants him to pay up. So is this done deal, game over, we're good to go? DILLON: No. This has been a knock-down, drag-out fight. And Twitter has every reason to be suspicious that this is some sort of gambit from Musk to delay the trial. A company spokesperson sent out a brief statement that said the intention of the company is to close the transaction at the agreed upon price. It's likely Twitter will ask the court for reassurances that Musk really means it and stipulations so he won't try to back out this time. KELLY: Stipulations - elaborate on that. DILLON: There has been so much drama in this case. Remember, Musk sought out Twitter, not the other way around. Once Twitter agreed to sell, Musk almost immediately started badmouthing it in public, questioning how many real people use the platform as opposed to, say, bots or spam accounts and finally saying he didn't want it. As of right now, the trial date is still October 17. And the parties have until then to agree to a settlement. KELLY: In the 30 seconds or so we have left, what does this say about Elon Musk as a businessperson? I mean, not that he's asking, but none of this leaves me burning to cut a deal with Elon Musk. DILLON: Well, he's still known as an ambitious, hard-working, successful businessman who can raise a lot of money really quick. But his behavior throughout all of this might have scared off some of those investors and embarrassed his rich and powerful Silicon Valley friends, maybe even hurt his own interests. The irony is that he made Twitter look pretty bad. And now, he's very likely to own it. KELLY: NPR's Raquel Maria Dillon, thanks so much. DILLON: Thank you. My pleasure.

(SOUNDBITE OF COIN SPINNING)KENNY MALONE, HOST:  I don't know what a semiconductor does. I don't understand it. I've never understood it. MIIN WU: Well, semiconductor is very simple way, right? MALONE: Sure - very simple if you are Miin Wu, who runs a multibillion dollar semiconductor company in what is now the semiconductor capital of the world - Taiwan. WU: Semi means is half, so this is not conductor, but the - in the certain conditions, and they can conduct in the current. RAMTIN ARABLOUEI, BYLINE: Semiconductors are these little electronic building blocks that can do all kinds of different things. Semiconductors are key to making microchips, and microchips are critical parts of everything - phones and laptops and satellites and even nuclear weapons. MALONE: But Miin Wu fell in love with semiconductors way back in the 1960s, when no one knew exactly what they would become. Miin just knew that he was thrilled by the technology. Miin, when this was a new technology, like this was - you were learning about it at school, how did you explain this to your - either your parents or your grandma even? WU: Well, fortunately, I don't have to explain to them because they have no interest to find out what I'm doing, OK? MALONE: They understood you were excited about it, though. WU: No. MALONE: No? WU: Even today - my mother already 96 years old. She still don't know what I'm doing, OK? She only know I'm busy (laughter). (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)MALONE: Hello, and welcome to PLANET MONEY. I'm Kenny Malone, and joining me today, from NPR's Peabody Award-winning podcast Throughline, Ramtin Arablouei. ARABLOUEI: That's just - that's, like, way too generous and too nice. MALONE: Facts. ARABLOUEI: Y'all are the OGs. MALONE: Just facts, Ramtin. ARABLOUEI: So we're just swimming in your wake. MALONE: Well, listen, we are joined by Ramtin and Throughline today because we want to talk about a big, sweeping history that is also about economics because as tensions between the U. S. and China have increased, there's been more and more attention on and concern for Taiwan. And we're collaborating with Throughline to understand how an island about half the size of South Carolina wound up in the middle of perhaps the biggest geopolitical and economic feud in generations. ARABLOUEI: Taiwan now makes almost all of the world's advanced semiconductors. And today on the show, we follow Miin Wu and Taiwan's semiconductor love story. It's a story of revolution, cold war and an economic expansion so incredible that it's now just called the Taiwan Miracle. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)MALONE: All right, we're back with a special PLANET MONEY collaboration with NPR's Throughline, looking today at how Taiwan became the center of the world's semiconductor industry and also wound up at the center of what may become the most important geopolitical feud in generations. ARABLOUEI: Taiwan is now a self-governed democracy of about 24 million people. However, China believes that Taiwan is - and always has been - part of China. China has vowed to reunify Taiwan with the mainland, which to some sounds like a threat. MALONE: And just a touch of history about how we got to this point - Ramtin, would you sprinkle a little - some of that magic Throughline sound design on this for us? ARABLOUEI: Absolutely. Here we go. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ARABLOUEI: In 1949, China underwent its Communist Revolution. The party pushed out by the revolution - the nationalist government - fled to a nearby island about 100 miles southeast of mainland China - a place often known at that time as Formosa. MALONE: Formosa - of course, more commonly known as Taiwan - it is a tropical/subtropical island, and in the 1940s, it was relatively undeveloped when this wave of people came from mainland China. ARABLOUEI: In total, around 2 million civilians and soldiers fled to Taiwan. And it wasn't supposed to be a permanent home - just a place to wait until the nationalists could retake China. MALONE: But years and years went by, and this theoretically temporary population had kids, raised kids in this theoretically temporary home. There weren't a ton of opportunities, and by the 1970s, thousands of young Taiwanese college graduates started going abroad for jobs or for grad school. WU: At that time, I was - study grad school in Taiwan, and I planned to work in Taiwan. MALONE: Miin Wu had graduated from college in Taiwan. He wanted to get a master's in electrical engineering. But he had started to wonder - should he also leave Taiwan? Of course, he had big feelings about all of this. WU: Well, of course, you know, nevers (ph) - you know, first time go to a place where I have no idea, and also, I'm not speaking the language. MALONE: But there were two big reasons to leave. Number one - his girlfriend was also leaving Taiwan to study in the U. S. So Miin thought, you know, it probably would be good for this relationship to at least be on the same continent as his girlfriend. ARABLOUEI: But reason number two - Miin was a budding semiconductor nerd. And he knew that whatever techie future was coming, he needed to leave Taiwan to be a part of it. MALONE: Miin applied to grad schools. He got into McGill University in Montreal, Canada, and landed a position there as a teaching assistant. WU: When I arrive at McGill, the first day of the school because I got teaching assistant, so I have to report to the professor. So went to see him, and he say something to me. (SOUNDBITE OF ROBOT SPEECH)WU: I was stuck. I didn't know what he's saying. He repeat one more time. (SOUNDBITE OF ROBOT SPEECH)WU: And I still don't get it, OK? So he complained to the professor who assign me to him, his class, and he say, how come you send me someone don't know English to me? ARABLOUEI: Miin later found out what his professor was saying. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Good morning. WU: He say good morning in heavy British accent. So I was totally out, OK? MALONE: Did you do things actively to try and learn English quickly? Did you listen to NPR constantly? WU: (Laughter) No. At that time, I have no idea about NPR. MALONE: Although, Miin says, he was using a different kind of radio to study English. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #1: . . . To Hubie Brooks. He's got it. This game is over. It was never in doubt. The Expos have beaten the Pirates 6-5. WU: I turn on radio to hear the baseball game. MALONE: Yeah. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #1: . . . Number 27 for the terminator. WU: And then I hear the hockey game. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #1: . . . Make it two in a row for the Pirates. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #2: . . . And the puck comes out of the Montreal end. WU: You know, Montreal Canadiens was a very good team at that time, in the '70s. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #2: And the game is over. The Montreal Canadiens have won the Stanley Cup for a record 16th time. (CHEERING)WU: That's how I pick up the speed. (CHEERING)MALONE: Miin's English improved. He finishes up at McGill, gets into Stanford for another graduate program. ARABLOUEI: And when Miin describes working his way through the North American tech world, this language thing comes up in ways that don't sound like they were just about language. MALONE: Like, Miin remembers turning in a lab report to a big deal Stanford professor and getting just these few words of feedback. WU: This is not English. I have to redo it. MALONE: Miin studies more, gets that master's from Stanford and then gets a job at a relatively new company using semiconductors to make memory chips. That company. . . (SOUNDBITE OF INTEL JINGLE)MALONE: . . . Intel. WU: In Intel, I did very good job on technical side. But I lost battle as into a program manager position because they tell me there's another guy, and his English better than me. I lost the battle. MALONE: So English was often part of the battle during your time in the U. S. WU: Yes. Exactly. MALONE: On one hand, there was no better place than Silicon Valley for Miin Wu. That geeky 1960s kid in Taiwan had grown up and was now at the burning hot center of this obscure technology he loved. On the other hand, he was starting to feel like as long as he stayed in the United States, he would inevitably crash into some kind of ceiling. TOM GOLD: A lot of the people who graduated from engineering schools in Taiwan felt that they were coming up against a glass ceiling. ARABLOUEI: This is Tom Gold, a professor of sociology at UC Berkeley, author of a book called \"State And Society In The Taiwan Miracle. \"GOLD: So that's where K. T. Li came in. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ARABLOUEI: There was a man 7,000 miles away in Taiwan who had started to sense that there might be lots of people like Miin Wu. GOLD: So K. T. Li was somebody who I think saw - if you want to call it - the handwriting on the wall. ARABLOUEI: Li Kwoh-ting - otherwise known as K. T. Li - some people call him the father of Taiwan's Economic Miracle. MALONE: Big deal - important enough that there's apparently a marble bust of him, named an asteroid after him. GOLD: He's a hero in modern Taiwan. ARABLOUEI: K. T. Li died in 2001. But Tom spent some time with him in the late 1970s. GOLD: I met K. T. , and he told me that he was teaching a class at National Taiwan University, which is the premier university. So every Saturday morning, I would go to this class, which was conducted in Chinese. Well, he was slim, under 6 feet tall. He had - as I recall, he had a prominent nose - pretty nice-looking, handsome older man. He seemed very sober, very levelheaded, the sort of guy you could trust right away. And he was somebody who understood what the potential of Taiwan was. MALONE: The potential of Taiwan, something that, frankly, the United States had also started to wonder about, beginning at least as early as the Cold War. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Since the Korean War, the United States has extended both economic and military aid to the free Chinese to keep the island from falling into communists' hands. ARABLOUEI: After China had its communist revolution in 1949, the United States started to become more and more concerned about the rise of communism in the world. MALONE: And in its fight against communism, the U. S. realized that having a buddy near mainland China was going to be important - a buddy like Taiwan. GOLD: We were providing grants. We were providing loans. We were providing subsidies across the board. MALONE: All of this foreign aid happened to come at a pretty useful time for Taiwan. See - the economy had mostly been built around agriculture. But Taiwan, along with K. T. Li, had decided to try and shift that economy away from farming. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #1: In 10 years, more than 6600 new factories of all kinds have been built and all are expanding and prospering. . . ARABLOUEI: Taiwan, with foreign help, transformed its economy. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #1: This mushrooming of industrialization has raised the foremost of standard of living to a place. . . ARABLOUEI: Over just a few decades, Taiwan evolved from an agricultural economy into a manufacturing economy. You may remember this period of time in the 1980s when it seemed like every toy or shirt you picked up said made in Taiwan. MALONE: The fact that this happened so fast was such a big deal in development economics that people just started calling this the Taiwan miracle. However, notably handsome Taiwanese economic hero, K. T. Li - he thought that Taiwan could take yet another leap. He thought Taiwan could move past just making lower-tech toys and textiles and become the Silicon Valley of Asia. GOLD: Taiwan had to advance to the next stage, and that was going to be technologically intensive industries. ARABLOUEI: K. T. Li was an economics minister and then finance minister and then basically minister at large in Taiwan. And in 1979, he oversaw the very funky and cool name task force of STAG - a. k. a. the Science and Technology Advisory Group. MALONE: And so Taiwan, guided by K. T. Li and his colleagues, poured money into building up the research and development at Taiwan's universities. They set up national laboratories that would share discoveries with the private tech sector Taiwan hoped to develop. And they identified a very specific location to try and transform into the Taiwanese version of Silicon Valley. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ARABLOUEI: They found a small, unremarkable piece of land in the city of Hsinchu. GOLD: You know, it looks rolling hills, and it's green, and it's clean. And it's going to look more like Palo Alto than it looks like, you know, just a barren cement desert. MALONE: K. T. Li and his colleagues made this an industrial zone, offered tax breaks, other incentives. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #2: Hsinchu Science Park is sometimes called the Silicon Valley of Taiwan. ARABLOUEI: But there was a huge obstacle for K. T. Li's tech tree. To build a Taiwanese Silicon Valley, Taiwan needed engineers. And lots of engineers, like Miin Wu, had left the island. GOLD: A lot of the people who graduated from engineering schools in Taiwan felt that their future really didn't lie in Taiwan. So a lot of them came to the U. S, and they started working for companies like Texas Instruments and companies in Silicon Valley, which was just getting going. ARABLOUEI: And this is when K. T. Li rolls up his sleeves. He started crossing over the Pacific to try and convince Taiwan's tech talent to come back. GOLD: Bringing these people from Taiwan together and saying, look - we realize that, you know, you're facing these glass ceilings in the United States, but if you come back to Taiwan, if you come back, you know, we will supply you with laboratories. We'll supply you with all of the infrastructure that you need. We'll supply you with engineers. We'll find loans. We'll invest with you. And we won't make political demands on you. ARABLOUEI: In short, K. T. Li was pulling out all the stops and trying to lure talent back home. WU: At the time, I was about 40 years old. ARABLOUEI: Talent like Miin Wu. WU: So we are already in California for 12 years. You know. . . ARABLOUEI: You're married to your girlfriend at this point. WU: Oh, yeah. ARABLOUEI: Smart, smart man. WU: (Laughter). MALONE: But he was tired of hitting that ceiling over and over. He quit his job at Intel to see if he could try to make his own path in the U. S. And he founded his own Silicon Valley company. WU: But very small. At that time, we have four people, five people to get started. MALONE: What is the name of that company, and what are you doing? WU: Called Macronix Inc. MALONE: Macronix Inc - and the way Miin describes it, he sounds like the Willy Wonka of semiconductors, like the company was playing with semiconductors and inventing all kinds of wild uses for this new technology, everything from using them to store information to one product that I definitely remember hearing about as a kid. WU: One product we know we called a key finder. Do you know the key finder? MALONE: Yeah. WU: If you're key lost, you know, you can whistle. (SOUNDBITE OF WHISTLE)WU: And then that device responds with a beep. (SOUNDBITE OF DEVICE BEEPING)WU: You know where they are. MALONE: You invented the key finder? WU: Yeah, well, we are part of it. We are making a lot of money on that. ARABLOUEI: These inventions, it's not like Miin's company was inventing them and then selling them directly to customers. Macronix would mostly do research and develop technology and then license their inventions to bigger companies with the real power, places with access to huge scale and enormous factories. MALONE: And that is what Miin wanted. Miin wanted Macronix to have its own factories to make its own semiconductor products. And he was hearing that maybe the place to build that kind of company was back in Taiwan. WU: You know, I'm from Taiwan, so I have many alumni and friends in this field, so. . . MALONE: You have your little birdies whispering to you, saying, Miin. . . WU: Yes. MALONE: . . . There's some stuff going on back here. Some interesting things are happening back in Taiwan. WU: Well, they don't have to tell me. I can read the newspaper. I know what was going on. So I was one of early member in the semiconductor field. So I think there's opportunity there. ARABLOUEI: Miin never personally met K. T. Li, but Miin was exactly the kind of person Li was trying to lure back to Taiwan. MALONE: But Miin wasn't going to be able to do this alone. Eventually, he starts meeting with other Taiwanese engineers, like himself, who'd left Taiwan for the United States. And now he was going to try and convince them to leave their jobs in the U. S. and come back to Taiwan with him. WU: I told them, in the U. S. , they have no opportunity because all their life, they are just engineer. Eventually, they need to move up. But in the U. S. , they have no opportunity. ARABLOUEI: Miin was making the case that in the U. S. , they're never going to see you as a boss or a manager or a CEO. WU: You know, I recruit several people I know, but then, from them, I looking to more. And then, this is the first time I bring those people back to Taiwan. So that was reverse brain drain. ARABLOUEI: Yeah. How many brains did you drain from the U. S. when you went back? Like, how many people did you bring with you? WU: In couple years, actually, 40. MALONE: Forty? ARABLOUEI: Forty? WU: Four-zero, 40. MALONE: Whoa. ARABLOUEI: All these engineers moving home? The K. T. Li plan was ramping up, and the stakes were much bigger than just economics. If Taiwan could transform into Asia's Silicon Valley, then it would become indispensable to the world, which would give it a kind of geopolitical shield. MALONE: This effort to bring Taiwanese talent home, it was maybe just about the economy in the moment. But it would ultimately be part of building a critical silicon shield for Taiwan. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: (Reading) The government of Taiwan is actively willing its sons and daughters home. ARABLOUEI: This is from an LA Times article in 1989 about Silicon Valley's reverse brain drain to Taiwan. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: (Reading) Its two offices in California maintain data on nearly 3,000 engineers and computer scientists, information they make available to Taiwanese talent scouts. In addition, they place recruiting ads in Chinese-language newspapers, such as a recent ad portraying an elephant separated from its herd and the plea, come home. ARABLOUEI: Was there a part of you in the back of your head, though, that was worried? What if this doesn't work? What if we go back to Taiwan, start this company, and it fails? WU: No, we will make it work. We will make it work. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)MALONE: After the break, Taiwan and Miin Wu build this so-called silicon shield with a little help from some very famous plumbers. (SOUNDBITE OF SUPER MARIO BROS. SOUND EFFECT)MALONE: The Taiwan miracle is indeed what people now call the extraordinarily fast shift in Taiwan's economy, from growing things to making things to making high-tech things. But it's important to note that even that miracle didn't include making semiconductors right away. ARABLOUEI: In the 1980s, Miin Wu was on a mission to come home and open one of the earliest semiconductor factories on the island. And sure, maybe Taiwan was more friendly to the kind of long-term, expensive business that Miin wanted to build. But he was still going to need money, lots of money. WU: Well, at that time, only raised about $800 million NT Dollars. And that means it's only 30 million U. S. dollar. MALONE: Only 30 million U. S. dollars. Miin needed even more than that. And to get it, he would have to pull off a kind of, like, business trick shot, one of the most joyous global trade schemes we have ever heard of. ARABLOUEI: A little bit of background here. By the late '70s, early '80s, semiconductors, memory chips in particular were becoming super important. And the world's leader was not in Taiwan. It wasn't in the U. S. It was Japan. Japan was, in fact, so good at certain kinds of semiconductors that the U. S. government had started complaining about Japanese semiconductors flooding the U. S. and world markets. MALONE: It was a classic dumping dispute. Dumping is the term for when one country heavily subsidizes a product and then floods a foreign market with this much cheaper product, which is quite bad for the local producers trying to compete. You may recall a recent example of this when the Trump administration accused China of dumping its steel in the U. S. market. Well, in the 1980s, the U. S. was mad at Japan for allegedly dumping cheap semiconductors and also for allegedly blocking the U. S. from selling semiconductors into the Japanese market. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #3: With the U. S. economy sinking, there is growing pressure in this country to get a better trade deal with the Japanese. UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #4: And that's not going to be easy because of the different way each country views both the causes and the cures. ARABLOUEI: But after pressure from U. S. businesses and a tense negotiation, the Japanese eventually agreed to stop their alleged dumping. But more importantly for our story, to open up its local microchip market to U. S. companies, specifically, Japan agreed that 20% of semiconductors they used would come from the U. S. MALONE: Miin Wu caught wind of this and thought this might be the break he needed. WU: So I caught that opportunity. Japanese have to open up 20% market to the U. S. company here. MALONE: And specifically, Miin knew exactly the right Japanese company to go after. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: This boy is doing more than just playing a video game. He has entered another world. MALONE: Ah, yeah. Nintendo. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #5: Nintendo is, well, almost the most fun a kid can have. MALONE: Yeah, sure. Anyway, we're talking about the original 8-bit and 16-bit systems here, the ones where you - you know, you had the blow on the cartridge, and then maybe that seemed to make them work. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #6: It may be the most addictive toy in history. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #7: In just three years, they've sold more than 11 million hardware units at about a hundred bucks each. MALONE: In the late 1980s and early '90s, Nintendo was exploding in popularity. And like any other computer system, it needed semiconductors. ARABLOUEI: And what Miin realized was that Nintendo was probably going to want a lot of American-made semiconductors because of that new 20% trade agreement. MALONE: If Miin could somehow land that contract, maybe that would be enough money to fund his dream of building, like, a proper semiconductor factory. But it was going to take an epic scheme to land that deal. ARABLOUEI: OK. Problem number one, Miin was in the process of leaving the U. S. and setting up shop in Taiwan. Nintendo did not need a Taiwanese company. MALONE: But Miin thought he did found a U. S. company, Macronix Inc. , the place that made the key whistling stuff. And so maybe Miin wasn't overseeing it anymore, but he still did found it and knew the people there. You know, plus, his Taiwanese company conveniently had the same name, Macronix International. Close enough. ARABLOUEI: And so he goes to Nintendo and says, look. We're Macronix. Sure, I'm in Taiwan now, but it's a U. S. company that I founded. WU: So Nintendo need a memory market to sell that cartridge to the U. S. customer. So I'm the only one. So they have to buy from me, has to. MALONE: And Nintendo apparently says, like, oh, OK, we're interested. Let's get some of these semiconductors then. Now, of course, this is problem number two. Miin does not have a semiconductor factory yet. That is what he's been trying to get money to build. And they take a long time to build. So whose semiconductors actually ended up in the Nintendos that were then shipping to the United States? WU: At that time, the biggest company called Samsung. MALONE: Oh, there were Samsungs. (Laughter). WU: We are buying Samsung and then sell it to them, OK? MALONE: Miin was buying South Korean Samsung semiconductors through a U. S. -based version of his company in order to sell them to a Japanese company. And the whole scheme was a way to fund his real dream of building his own semiconductor factory in Taiwan. ARABLOUEI: So this loophole around the 20%, this deal that cut with the U. S. , that was your opportunity? WU: Yes, precisely. MALONE: Miin, that is genius. WU: (Laughter). MALONE: And if you think about what was really happening, like, the global forces of it, you have these three global superpowers, China feuding with the U. S. , who was feuding with Japan. Miin realized that when these titans fight, there are ways to take advantage of that, almost like a video game. Miin was this clever sprite running circles around these giant bosses. ARABLOUEI: And at that point, is Nintendo your biggest client? WU: Yes. ARABLOUEI: Still? WU: Still. ARABLOUEI: Wow. WU: Even today, still No. 1. ARABLOUEI: Miin Wu's company grew up alongside Taiwan's semiconductor industry. He built his factory in Taiwan. He was part of this wave of major companies developing in Hsinchu Science Park. MALONE: In 1987, up pops Silicon Integrated Systems in the Hsinchu Science Park and then the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Macronix International - Miin's company - a couple years later. Within 15 years, there's Powerchip Semiconductor, MStar Semiconductor, Global Unichip Company (ph). ARABLOUEI: Yeah. All these companies that most of us have never heard of, they make semiconductors that we use every day in our cars and phones and Nintendo Switches. MALONE: I got one of these guys here. Do you recognize this here? WU: Nintendo, yes. This is a Switch. MALONE: This is a Switch. WU: Yes. MALONE: How many of your semiconductors, roughly, are in this guy here? WU: Well, every year, I shipping about hundred million unit to them. MALONE: This is Zelda: Breath of the Wild. So this is the best video game ever made. And you're telling me one of your semiconductors is inside the best video game ever made? WU: Or maybe two, and another one could be controller - and both from me. MALONE: Amazing. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)MALONE: It is the full realization of K. T. Li's vision to rapidly evolve Taiwan's economy. And it's the reason why he is known as the godfather of tech in Taiwan. He planted these seeds, these policies, and then tended to this idea. And it's now grown-up. ARABLOUEI: We talked about how Japan used to be the world's semiconductor leader. I mean, they used to make half of the world's semiconductors. But now they're trying to catch up with Taiwan. Frankly, the U. S. is, too, because today, almost all of the world's advanced semiconductors come from Taiwan. MALONE: And all of this is why people have started to call Taiwan's semiconductor industry its silicon shield. The idea is if the world has become completely dependent on Taiwan for microchips and semiconductors, then the island itself has become indispensable to the world. ARABLOUEI: And as global tensions rise, as the world worries more and more about whether China will try to invade Taiwan, this is where the silicon shield will get tested. Is China less likely to invade because China also needs Taiwanese semiconductors? Are countries like the U. S. more likely to intervene because it relies on Taiwan? MALONE: As this ratchets up, the stakes get much higher for business owners like Miin Wu. Miin's company has now grown into a roughly $60 billion company by market cap. And you can tell. Like, if you ask him about any of this bigger stuff - China, the U. S. , Taiwan - Miin has gotten very good at not saying anything at all. ARABLOUEI: Are you worried about what that success is going to do in terms of Taiwan's position and safety as it's stuck between, you know, China and the U. S. , obviously both having interests there? WU: What is good to me to worry about that? I'm a scientist. I'm the businessman. All I want to do is to create the best solution for the world. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ARABLOUEI: Today's show was produced by Sam Yellowhorse Kesler. It was mastered by Debbie Daughtry and edited by Jess Jiang. Special thanks to John Ruwitch and Nishant Dahiya for helping us get this story right. MALONE: And, of course, extra special thanks to the Throughline team. We couldn't have done this without them - Lawrence Wu, Casey Miner, Devin Katayama and Julie Caine. And if you don't already subscribe to Throughline, it is a superb podcast with, like, fascinating, sound-rich stories like the one you've heard today, everything from the history of \"Sesame Street\" to reality TV to their Peabody Award-winning series on Afghanistan. I cannot recommend it highly enough. We're so honored that you worked with us, Ramtin. Thank you so much. ARABLOUEI: Absolutely. It's such an honor to be here. Huge fan of the show. Thanks, Kenny. MALONE: I'm Kenny Malone, and I'm blushing. And I'm blushing. ARABLOUEI: (Laughter) And I'm Ramtin Arablouei. This is NPR. MALONE: Thanks for listening. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SYLVIE DOUGLIS, BYLINE: This is PLANET MONEY from NPR. (SOUNDBITE OF COIN SPINNING) KENNY MALONE, HOST:   I don't know what a semiconductor does. I don't understand it. I've never understood it. MIIN WU: Well, semiconductor is very simple way, right? MALONE: Sure - very simple if you are Miin Wu, who runs a multibillion dollar semiconductor company in what is now the semiconductor capital of the world - Taiwan. WU: Semi means is half, so this is not conductor, but the - in the certain conditions, and they can conduct in the current. RAMTIN ARABLOUEI, BYLINE: Semiconductors are these little electronic building blocks that can do all kinds of different things. Semiconductors are key to making microchips, and microchips are critical parts of everything - phones and laptops and satellites and even nuclear weapons. MALONE: But Miin Wu fell in love with semiconductors way back in the 1960s, when no one knew exactly what they would become. Miin just knew that he was thrilled by the technology. Miin, when this was a new technology, like this was - you were learning about it at school, how did you explain this to your - either your parents or your grandma even? WU: Well, fortunately, I don't have to explain to them because they have no interest to find out what I'm doing, OK? MALONE: They understood you were excited about it, though. WU: No. MALONE: No? WU: Even today - my mother already 96 years old. She still don't know what I'm doing, OK? She only know I'm busy (laughter). (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MALONE: Hello, and welcome to PLANET MONEY. I'm Kenny Malone, and joining me today, from NPR's Peabody Award-winning podcast Throughline, Ramtin Arablouei. ARABLOUEI: That's just - that's, like, way too generous and too nice. MALONE: Facts. ARABLOUEI: Y'all are the OGs. MALONE: Just facts, Ramtin. ARABLOUEI: So we're just swimming in your wake. MALONE: Well, listen, we are joined by Ramtin and Throughline today because we want to talk about a big, sweeping history that is also about economics because as tensions between the U. S. and China have increased, there's been more and more attention on and concern for Taiwan. And we're collaborating with Throughline to understand how an island about half the size of South Carolina wound up in the middle of perhaps the biggest geopolitical and economic feud in generations. ARABLOUEI: Taiwan now makes almost all of the world's advanced semiconductors. And today on the show, we follow Miin Wu and Taiwan's semiconductor love story. It's a story of revolution, cold war and an economic expansion so incredible that it's now just called the Taiwan Miracle. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MALONE: All right, we're back with a special PLANET MONEY collaboration with NPR's Throughline, looking today at how Taiwan became the center of the world's semiconductor industry and also wound up at the center of what may become the most important geopolitical feud in generations. ARABLOUEI: Taiwan is now a self-governed democracy of about 24 million people. However, China believes that Taiwan is - and always has been - part of China. China has vowed to reunify Taiwan with the mainland, which to some sounds like a threat. MALONE: And just a touch of history about how we got to this point - Ramtin, would you sprinkle a little - some of that magic Throughline sound design on this for us? ARABLOUEI: Absolutely. Here we go. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ARABLOUEI: In 1949, China underwent its Communist Revolution. The party pushed out by the revolution - the nationalist government - fled to a nearby island about 100 miles southeast of mainland China - a place often known at that time as Formosa. MALONE: Formosa - of course, more commonly known as Taiwan - it is a tropical/subtropical island, and in the 1940s, it was relatively undeveloped when this wave of people came from mainland China. ARABLOUEI: In total, around 2 million civilians and soldiers fled to Taiwan. And it wasn't supposed to be a permanent home - just a place to wait until the nationalists could retake China. MALONE: But years and years went by, and this theoretically temporary population had kids, raised kids in this theoretically temporary home. There weren't a ton of opportunities, and by the 1970s, thousands of young Taiwanese college graduates started going abroad for jobs or for grad school. WU: At that time, I was - study grad school in Taiwan, and I planned to work in Taiwan. MALONE: Miin Wu had graduated from college in Taiwan. He wanted to get a master's in electrical engineering. But he had started to wonder - should he also leave Taiwan? Of course, he had big feelings about all of this. WU: Well, of course, you know, nevers (ph) - you know, first time go to a place where I have no idea, and also, I'm not speaking the language. MALONE: But there were two big reasons to leave. Number one - his girlfriend was also leaving Taiwan to study in the U. S. So Miin thought, you know, it probably would be good for this relationship to at least be on the same continent as his girlfriend. ARABLOUEI: But reason number two - Miin was a budding semiconductor nerd. And he knew that whatever techie future was coming, he needed to leave Taiwan to be a part of it. MALONE: Miin applied to grad schools. He got into McGill University in Montreal, Canada, and landed a position there as a teaching assistant. WU: When I arrive at McGill, the first day of the school because I got teaching assistant, so I have to report to the professor. So went to see him, and he say something to me. (SOUNDBITE OF ROBOT SPEECH) WU: I was stuck. I didn't know what he's saying. He repeat one more time. (SOUNDBITE OF ROBOT SPEECH) WU: And I still don't get it, OK? So he complained to the professor who assign me to him, his class, and he say, how come you send me someone don't know English to me? ARABLOUEI: Miin later found out what his professor was saying. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Good morning. WU: He say good morning in heavy British accent. So I was totally out, OK? MALONE: Did you do things actively to try and learn English quickly? Did you listen to NPR constantly? WU: (Laughter) No. At that time, I have no idea about NPR. MALONE: Although, Miin says, he was using a different kind of radio to study English. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #1: . . . To Hubie Brooks. He's got it. This game is over. It was never in doubt. The Expos have beaten the Pirates 6-5. WU: I turn on radio to hear the baseball game. MALONE: Yeah. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #1: . . . Number 27 for the terminator. WU: And then I hear the hockey game. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #1: . . . Make it two in a row for the Pirates. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #2: . . . And the puck comes out of the Montreal end. WU: You know, Montreal Canadiens was a very good team at that time, in the '70s. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER #2: And the game is over. The Montreal Canadiens have won the Stanley Cup for a record 16th time. (CHEERING) WU: That's how I pick up the speed. (CHEERING) MALONE: Miin's English improved. He finishes up at McGill, gets into Stanford for another graduate program. ARABLOUEI: And when Miin describes working his way through the North American tech world, this language thing comes up in ways that don't sound like they were just about language. MALONE: Like, Miin remembers turning in a lab report to a big deal Stanford professor and getting just these few words of feedback. WU: This is not English. I have to redo it. MALONE: Miin studies more, gets that master's from Stanford and then gets a job at a relatively new company using semiconductors to make memory chips. That company. . . (SOUNDBITE OF INTEL JINGLE) MALONE: . . . Intel. WU: In Intel, I did very good job on technical side. But I lost battle as into a program manager position because they tell me there's another guy, and his English better than me. I lost the battle. MALONE: So English was often part of the battle during your time in the U. S. WU: Yes. Exactly. MALONE: On one hand, there was no better place than Silicon Valley for Miin Wu. That geeky 1960s kid in Taiwan had grown up and was now at the burning hot center of this obscure technology he loved. On the other hand, he was starting to feel like as long as he stayed in the United States, he would inevitably crash into some kind of ceiling. TOM GOLD: A lot of the people who graduated from engineering schools in Taiwan felt that they were coming up against a glass ceiling. ARABLOUEI: This is Tom Gold, a professor of sociology at UC Berkeley, author of a book called \"State And Society In The Taiwan Miracle. \" GOLD: So that's where K. T. Li came in. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ARABLOUEI: There was a man 7,000 miles away in Taiwan who had started to sense that there might be lots of people like Miin Wu. GOLD: So K. T. Li was somebody who I think saw - if you want to call it - the handwriting on the wall. ARABLOUEI: Li Kwoh-ting - otherwise known as K. T. Li - some people call him the father of Taiwan's Economic Miracle. MALONE: Big deal - important enough that there's apparently a marble bust of him, named an asteroid after him. GOLD: He's a hero in modern Taiwan. ARABLOUEI: K. T. Li died in 2001. But Tom spent some time with him in the late 1970s. GOLD: I met K. T. , and he told me that he was teaching a class at National Taiwan University, which is the premier university. So every Saturday morning, I would go to this class, which was conducted in Chinese. Well, he was slim, under 6 feet tall. He had - as I recall, he had a prominent nose - pretty nice-looking, handsome older man. He seemed very sober, very levelheaded, the sort of guy you could trust right away. And he was somebody who understood what the potential of Taiwan was. MALONE: The potential of Taiwan, something that, frankly, the United States had also started to wonder about, beginning at least as early as the Cold War. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Since the Korean War, the United States has extended both economic and military aid to the free Chinese to keep the island from falling into communists' hands. ARABLOUEI: After China had its communist revolution in 1949, the United States started to become more and more concerned about the rise of communism in the world. MALONE: And in its fight against communism, the U. S. realized that having a buddy near mainland China was going to be important - a buddy like Taiwan. GOLD: We were providing grants. We were providing loans. We were providing subsidies across the board. MALONE: All of this foreign aid happened to come at a pretty useful time for Taiwan. See - the economy had mostly been built around agriculture. But Taiwan, along with K. T. Li, had decided to try and shift that economy away from farming. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #1: In 10 years, more than 6600 new factories of all kinds have been built and all are expanding and prospering. . . ARABLOUEI: Taiwan, with foreign help, transformed its economy. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #1: This mushrooming of industrialization has raised the foremost of standard of living to a place. . . ARABLOUEI: Over just a few decades, Taiwan evolved from an agricultural economy into a manufacturing economy. You may remember this period of time in the 1980s when it seemed like every toy or shirt you picked up said made in Taiwan. MALONE: The fact that this happened so fast was such a big deal in development economics that people just started calling this the Taiwan miracle. However, notably handsome Taiwanese economic hero, K. T. Li - he thought that Taiwan could take yet another leap. He thought Taiwan could move past just making lower-tech toys and textiles and become the Silicon Valley of Asia. GOLD: Taiwan had to advance to the next stage, and that was going to be technologically intensive industries. ARABLOUEI: K. T. Li was an economics minister and then finance minister and then basically minister at large in Taiwan. And in 1979, he oversaw the very funky and cool name task force of STAG - a. k. a. the Science and Technology Advisory Group. MALONE: And so Taiwan, guided by K. T. Li and his colleagues, poured money into building up the research and development at Taiwan's universities. They set up national laboratories that would share discoveries with the private tech sector Taiwan hoped to develop. And they identified a very specific location to try and transform into the Taiwanese version of Silicon Valley. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ARABLOUEI: They found a small, unremarkable piece of land in the city of Hsinchu. GOLD: You know, it looks rolling hills, and it's green, and it's clean. And it's going to look more like Palo Alto than it looks like, you know, just a barren cement desert. MALONE: K. T. Li and his colleagues made this an industrial zone, offered tax breaks, other incentives. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #2: Hsinchu Science Park is sometimes called the Silicon Valley of Taiwan. ARABLOUEI: But there was a huge obstacle for K. T. Li's tech tree. To build a Taiwanese Silicon Valley, Taiwan needed engineers. And lots of engineers, like Miin Wu, had left the island. GOLD: A lot of the people who graduated from engineering schools in Taiwan felt that their future really didn't lie in Taiwan. So a lot of them came to the U. S, and they started working for companies like Texas Instruments and companies in Silicon Valley, which was just getting going. ARABLOUEI: And this is when K. T. Li rolls up his sleeves. He started crossing over the Pacific to try and convince Taiwan's tech talent to come back. GOLD: Bringing these people from Taiwan together and saying, look - we realize that, you know, you're facing these glass ceilings in the United States, but if you come back to Taiwan, if you come back, you know, we will supply you with laboratories. We'll supply you with all of the infrastructure that you need. We'll supply you with engineers. We'll find loans. We'll invest with you. And we won't make political demands on you. ARABLOUEI: In short, K. T. Li was pulling out all the stops and trying to lure talent back home. WU: At the time, I was about 40 years old. ARABLOUEI: Talent like Miin Wu. WU: So we are already in California for 12 years. You know. . . ARABLOUEI: You're married to your girlfriend at this point. WU: Oh, yeah. ARABLOUEI: Smart, smart man. WU: (Laughter). MALONE: But he was tired of hitting that ceiling over and over. He quit his job at Intel to see if he could try to make his own path in the U. S. And he founded his own Silicon Valley company. WU: But very small. At that time, we have four people, five people to get started. MALONE: What is the name of that company, and what are you doing? WU: Called Macronix Inc. MALONE: Macronix Inc - and the way Miin describes it, he sounds like the Willy Wonka of semiconductors, like the company was playing with semiconductors and inventing all kinds of wild uses for this new technology, everything from using them to store information to one product that I definitely remember hearing about as a kid. WU: One product we know we called a key finder. Do you know the key finder? MALONE: Yeah. WU: If you're key lost, you know, you can whistle. (SOUNDBITE OF WHISTLE) WU: And then that device responds with a beep. (SOUNDBITE OF DEVICE BEEPING) WU: You know where they are. MALONE: You invented the key finder? WU: Yeah, well, we are part of it. We are making a lot of money on that. ARABLOUEI: These inventions, it's not like Miin's company was inventing them and then selling them directly to customers. Macronix would mostly do research and develop technology and then license their inventions to bigger companies with the real power, places with access to huge scale and enormous factories. MALONE: And that is what Miin wanted. Miin wanted Macronix to have its own factories to make its own semiconductor products. And he was hearing that maybe the place to build that kind of company was back in Taiwan. WU: You know, I'm from Taiwan, so I have many alumni and friends in this field, so. . . MALONE: You have your little birdies whispering to you, saying, Miin. . . WU: Yes. MALONE: . . . There's some stuff going on back here. Some interesting things are happening back in Taiwan. WU: Well, they don't have to tell me. I can read the newspaper. I know what was going on. So I was one of early member in the semiconductor field. So I think there's opportunity there. ARABLOUEI: Miin never personally met K. T. Li, but Miin was exactly the kind of person Li was trying to lure back to Taiwan. MALONE: But Miin wasn't going to be able to do this alone. Eventually, he starts meeting with other Taiwanese engineers, like himself, who'd left Taiwan for the United States. And now he was going to try and convince them to leave their jobs in the U. S. and come back to Taiwan with him. WU: I told them, in the U. S. , they have no opportunity because all their life, they are just engineer. Eventually, they need to move up. But in the U. S. , they have no opportunity. ARABLOUEI: Miin was making the case that in the U. S. , they're never going to see you as a boss or a manager or a CEO. WU: You know, I recruit several people I know, but then, from them, I looking to more. And then, this is the first time I bring those people back to Taiwan. So that was reverse brain drain. ARABLOUEI: Yeah. How many brains did you drain from the U. S. when you went back? Like, how many people did you bring with you? WU: In couple years, actually, 40. MALONE: Forty? ARABLOUEI: Forty? WU: Four-zero, 40. MALONE: Whoa. ARABLOUEI: All these engineers moving home? The K. T. Li plan was ramping up, and the stakes were much bigger than just economics. If Taiwan could transform into Asia's Silicon Valley, then it would become indispensable to the world, which would give it a kind of geopolitical shield. MALONE: This effort to bring Taiwanese talent home, it was maybe just about the economy in the moment. But it would ultimately be part of building a critical silicon shield for Taiwan. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: (Reading) The government of Taiwan is actively willing its sons and daughters home. ARABLOUEI: This is from an LA Times article in 1989 about Silicon Valley's reverse brain drain to Taiwan. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: (Reading) Its two offices in California maintain data on nearly 3,000 engineers and computer scientists, information they make available to Taiwanese talent scouts. In addition, they place recruiting ads in Chinese-language newspapers, such as a recent ad portraying an elephant separated from its herd and the plea, come home. ARABLOUEI: Was there a part of you in the back of your head, though, that was worried? What if this doesn't work? What if we go back to Taiwan, start this company, and it fails? WU: No, we will make it work. We will make it work. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MALONE: After the break, Taiwan and Miin Wu build this so-called silicon shield with a little help from some very famous plumbers. (SOUNDBITE OF SUPER MARIO BROS. SOUND EFFECT) MALONE: The Taiwan miracle is indeed what people now call the extraordinarily fast shift in Taiwan's economy, from growing things to making things to making high-tech things. But it's important to note that even that miracle didn't include making semiconductors right away. ARABLOUEI: In the 1980s, Miin Wu was on a mission to come home and open one of the earliest semiconductor factories on the island. And sure, maybe Taiwan was more friendly to the kind of long-term, expensive business that Miin wanted to build. But he was still going to need money, lots of money. WU: Well, at that time, only raised about $800 million NT Dollars. And that means it's only 30 million U. S. dollar. MALONE: Only 30 million U. S. dollars. Miin needed even more than that. And to get it, he would have to pull off a kind of, like, business trick shot, one of the most joyous global trade schemes we have ever heard of. ARABLOUEI: A little bit of background here. By the late '70s, early '80s, semiconductors, memory chips in particular were becoming super important. And the world's leader was not in Taiwan. It wasn't in the U. S. It was Japan. Japan was, in fact, so good at certain kinds of semiconductors that the U. S. government had started complaining about Japanese semiconductors flooding the U. S. and world markets. MALONE: It was a classic dumping dispute. Dumping is the term for when one country heavily subsidizes a product and then floods a foreign market with this much cheaper product, which is quite bad for the local producers trying to compete. You may recall a recent example of this when the Trump administration accused China of dumping its steel in the U. S. market. Well, in the 1980s, the U. S. was mad at Japan for allegedly dumping cheap semiconductors and also for allegedly blocking the U. S. from selling semiconductors into the Japanese market. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #3: With the U. S. economy sinking, there is growing pressure in this country to get a better trade deal with the Japanese. UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #4: And that's not going to be easy because of the different way each country views both the causes and the cures. ARABLOUEI: But after pressure from U. S. businesses and a tense negotiation, the Japanese eventually agreed to stop their alleged dumping. But more importantly for our story, to open up its local microchip market to U. S. companies, specifically, Japan agreed that 20% of semiconductors they used would come from the U. S. MALONE: Miin Wu caught wind of this and thought this might be the break he needed. WU: So I caught that opportunity. Japanese have to open up 20% market to the U. S. company here. MALONE: And specifically, Miin knew exactly the right Japanese company to go after. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: This boy is doing more than just playing a video game. He has entered another world. MALONE: Ah, yeah. Nintendo. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #5: Nintendo is, well, almost the most fun a kid can have. MALONE: Yeah, sure. Anyway, we're talking about the original 8-bit and 16-bit systems here, the ones where you - you know, you had the blow on the cartridge, and then maybe that seemed to make them work. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #6: It may be the most addictive toy in history. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #7: In just three years, they've sold more than 11 million hardware units at about a hundred bucks each. MALONE: In the late 1980s and early '90s, Nintendo was exploding in popularity. And like any other computer system, it needed semiconductors. ARABLOUEI: And what Miin realized was that Nintendo was probably going to want a lot of American-made semiconductors because of that new 20% trade agreement. MALONE: If Miin could somehow land that contract, maybe that would be enough money to fund his dream of building, like, a proper semiconductor factory. But it was going to take an epic scheme to land that deal. ARABLOUEI: OK. Problem number one, Miin was in the process of leaving the U. S. and setting up shop in Taiwan. Nintendo did not need a Taiwanese company. MALONE: But Miin thought he did found a U. S. company, Macronix Inc. , the place that made the key whistling stuff. And so maybe Miin wasn't overseeing it anymore, but he still did found it and knew the people there. You know, plus, his Taiwanese company conveniently had the same name, Macronix International. Close enough. ARABLOUEI: And so he goes to Nintendo and says, look. We're Macronix. Sure, I'm in Taiwan now, but it's a U. S. company that I founded. WU: So Nintendo need a memory market to sell that cartridge to the U. S. customer. So I'm the only one. So they have to buy from me, has to. MALONE: And Nintendo apparently says, like, oh, OK, we're interested. Let's get some of these semiconductors then. Now, of course, this is problem number two. Miin does not have a semiconductor factory yet. That is what he's been trying to get money to build. And they take a long time to build. So whose semiconductors actually ended up in the Nintendos that were then shipping to the United States? WU: At that time, the biggest company called Samsung. MALONE: Oh, there were Samsungs. (Laughter). WU: We are buying Samsung and then sell it to them, OK? MALONE: Miin was buying South Korean Samsung semiconductors through a U. S. -based version of his company in order to sell them to a Japanese company. And the whole scheme was a way to fund his real dream of building his own semiconductor factory in Taiwan. ARABLOUEI: So this loophole around the 20%, this deal that cut with the U. S. , that was your opportunity? WU: Yes, precisely. MALONE: Miin, that is genius. WU: (Laughter). MALONE: And if you think about what was really happening, like, the global forces of it, you have these three global superpowers, China feuding with the U. S. , who was feuding with Japan. Miin realized that when these titans fight, there are ways to take advantage of that, almost like a video game. Miin was this clever sprite running circles around these giant bosses. ARABLOUEI: And at that point, is Nintendo your biggest client? WU: Yes. ARABLOUEI: Still? WU: Still. ARABLOUEI: Wow. WU: Even today, still No. 1. ARABLOUEI: Miin Wu's company grew up alongside Taiwan's semiconductor industry. He built his factory in Taiwan. He was part of this wave of major companies developing in Hsinchu Science Park. MALONE: In 1987, up pops Silicon Integrated Systems in the Hsinchu Science Park and then the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Macronix International - Miin's company - a couple years later. Within 15 years, there's Powerchip Semiconductor, MStar Semiconductor, Global Unichip Company (ph). ARABLOUEI: Yeah. All these companies that most of us have never heard of, they make semiconductors that we use every day in our cars and phones and Nintendo Switches. MALONE: I got one of these guys here. Do you recognize this here? WU: Nintendo, yes. This is a Switch. MALONE: This is a Switch. WU: Yes. MALONE: How many of your semiconductors, roughly, are in this guy here? WU: Well, every year, I shipping about hundred million unit to them. MALONE: This is Zelda: Breath of the Wild. So this is the best video game ever made. And you're telling me one of your semiconductors is inside the best video game ever made? WU: Or maybe two, and another one could be controller - and both from me. MALONE: Amazing. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MALONE: It is the full realization of K. T. Li's vision to rapidly evolve Taiwan's economy. And it's the reason why he is known as the godfather of tech in Taiwan. He planted these seeds, these policies, and then tended to this idea. And it's now grown-up. ARABLOUEI: We talked about how Japan used to be the world's semiconductor leader. I mean, they used to make half of the world's semiconductors. But now they're trying to catch up with Taiwan. Frankly, the U. S. is, too, because today, almost all of the world's advanced semiconductors come from Taiwan. MALONE: And all of this is why people have started to call Taiwan's semiconductor industry its silicon shield. The idea is if the world has become completely dependent on Taiwan for microchips and semiconductors, then the island itself has become indispensable to the world. ARABLOUEI: And as global tensions rise, as the world worries more and more about whether China will try to invade Taiwan, this is where the silicon shield will get tested. Is China less likely to invade because China also needs Taiwanese semiconductors? Are countries like the U. S. more likely to intervene because it relies on Taiwan? MALONE: As this ratchets up, the stakes get much higher for business owners like Miin Wu. Miin's company has now grown into a roughly $60 billion company by market cap. And you can tell. Like, if you ask him about any of this bigger stuff - China, the U. S. , Taiwan - Miin has gotten very good at not saying anything at all. ARABLOUEI: Are you worried about what that success is going to do in terms of Taiwan's position and safety as it's stuck between, you know, China and the U. S. , obviously both having interests there? WU: What is good to me to worry about that? I'm a scientist. I'm the businessman. All I want to do is to create the best solution for the world.

So it has rules against harassment, hate speech, extremism, false or misleading claims about elections and COVID. But Musk says these are too restrictive. He says Twitter should allow basically all legal speech. And that would be a big change. I spoke with Angelo Carusone, president of the liberal watchdog group Media Matters for America, and he says, for an idea of what this might look like, you can just look to social media sites that have much laxer rules like Parler and Truth Social, the site backed by former President Trump. ANGELO CARUSONE: You can look at these alternative platforms where the feature is the bug, where being able to say and do, you know, the kinds of things that we prohibited from more mainstream social media platforms is actually why everyone gravitates to them. And what we see there is that they are cauldrons of misinformation and abuse. CHANG: Yeah. Well, you know, Shannon, you mentioned Donald Trump, which, you know, we all remember he was banned from Twitter after January 6. What has Musk said about that? BOND: Well, he said that banning of Trump was a, quote, \"morally bad and foolish decision\" - and says he'd bring him back. And Musk has been really critical of the idea that anyone should be permanently banned from Twitter except spambots and he says people who explicitly advocate violence. And so that could mean not just letting Trump back, but other banned users, too - conspiracy theorists, anti-vaccine activists, election deniers. In a kind of ripple effect, you know, Facebook is considering whether to reinstate Trump when its ban expires in January. And, you know, in some minds, if Twitter lets Trump back on, it could make it easier for Facebook to do the same, even as we see Trump further embracing this stolen election lie and other conspiracy theories. CHANG: Well, ultimately, what do you think all this will mean for Twitter as a business? BOND: Well, you know, Twitter has struggled for a long time to make money. You know, it relies on advertising. But it's hard to see advertisers wanting to be on a site that has a lot of hate speech and harassment and toxicity - or users, frankly, too. So Musk, you know, has talked about moving away from advertising. His latest idea is to turn Twitter into what he calls an everything app, so an app that you could use for messaging, but also for payments, maybe even to do ride hailing, anything you could do online - right? - could be your sort of digital hub. But, Ailsa, I think it's important to remember Musk loves to talk about these grand visions - right? - making electric cars cool, going to Mars.

On Thursday, a judge gave Musk and Twitter until October 28 to close their deal and end their months-long legal fight and avoid a high-profile trial. But the latest twist in this ongoing saga has resurfaced questions about what the popular social media site will look like under the leadership of a so-called free speech absolutist. Musk has openly criticized Twitter's policies that monitor hate speech, disinformation and online abuse, and has publicly claimed he would work to undo some of them. That made us want to reach out to Nina Jankowicz. She is a disinformation expert who's spent years researching online behavior and safety. But her interest in this, as it is for many women in public life, is not just academic. Earlier this year, she was the target of a vicious campaign of online abuse, all because she was appointed to a federal government working group aimed at combating disinformation. So we thought about what a Twitter buyout could mean for the safety of women, and for that matter, other historically marginalized groups online. That's a topic she writes about in her book, \"How To Be a Woman Online: Surviving Abuse And Harassment, And How To Fight Back. \" And she's with us once again. Nina Jankowicz, thanks so much for joining us. NINA JANKOWICZ: Great to talk to you again, Michel. MARTIN: So it seems at least somewhat likely that Musk could own Twitter by the end of the month. Of course, the story has had so many twists and turns, you know, we can't know for sure. But as a person who spends a lot of time looking at social media and engaging with it, what was your reaction to this week's news? JANKOWICZ: For a free speech absolutist to take control of a platform like Twitter, where so many people spend their time and when there's where there's a lot of debate going on, this is not just about, you know, allowing a free speech free-for-all. This is about eventually silencing marginalized voices. That free speech free-for-all is going to mean less speech for marginalized groups. Because what happens online these days - and I know this personally, as you said - is it's not just the expressly illegal content or the content that directly incites violence. And that's the stuff that Musk said he would prohibit. All the rest of the policies would go away. It's not just that stuff that is silencing for marginalized groups. What I've experienced is that, you know, you get thousands and thousands of messages that are kind of borderline in terms of violence. Some of them are directly threatening. And what that does is change your calculus about how you engage online. You know, in Brazil, which is also in election season right now, Reporters Without Borders recently did a survey that showed that 80% of women journalists in Brazil change how they interact online because they're afraid of attacks, because they want to keep themselves safe from those attacks. And if we were to remove all the protections that Twitter has, I really worry about the silencing effect that that would have for women and marginalized voices. MARTIN: Could you talk a little bit about what that was like? As we mentioned, you were appointed to chair the Disinformation Governance Board. And then you quickly became the target of an online disinformation and harassment campaign. And I just want to point out that the purpose of this was to figure out how to deal with, for example, disinformation directed at would-be migrants, disinformation directed at people spreading falsehoods about COVID vaccinations and things like that. These are public safety measures and also measures designed to keep people from making bad decisions about whether to cross the border, for example, because we know that certain sort of campaigns are directed at some of these groups. So what is that like? JANKOWICZ: Yeah. I mean, so the first thing to understand is that the entire harassment campaign was based on this foundational lie that the Disinformation Governance Board would be policing American speech. And I think it's important to note that the board had absolutely no ability or purview to take any operational action like that. That's not political spin. That's just the truth. I would not have taken the job if that were the case. And so based on this foundational lie, I had thousands of my fellow Americans sending me, you know, things ranging from just kind of curse words and insults, picking apart my physical appearance, talking about the weight that I gained during pregnancy, things like that - because I was eight months pregnant at the time. But also, you know, direct threats to me and my family, my unborn child, people saying that I should be sent to Russia and killed, people saying that I had committed treason. And this was their 1776 moment. And I should, you know, watch my back, that sort of thing. My research, as you've noted, has focused on online harassment and abuse. And so I was probably as well-prepared as I could be for these attacks. But it was still really difficult because my work is online. And, you know, a lot of my life is online, as it is for most people these days. So by encountering these messages over and over and over, every time I opened up, not just Twitter but Facebook, but Instagram, every account that I have online, basically. And I've also received, you know, mail to my home, phone calls. It really does have an effect, even for someone who prides herself on being outspoken and will not back down. MARTIN: One of the things that I think is important to point out is that women aren't the only people who are subjected to this conduct. I mean, recently The Daily Beast wrote about a science fiction writer who four years ago wrote just a tweet saying he didn't think Norm MacDonald was that funny. I mean, this is before it was known that Norm MacDonald was suffering from cancer and so forth. But he just said, I don't think he's that funny. And so he has been subjected to a campaign of vicious harassment ever since by people who seem to think it's their job to do it. I mean, he has been swatted. He's had law enforcement falsely called to his home under false pretenses, and has been completely unable to defend himself from this conduct. And frankly, it's not an exaggeration to say that people who have been targets of online harassment campaigns have taken their own lives because it was just more than they could deal with. So the question I guess I have is, why is this not seen as more of a public health or criminal justice concern? JANKOWICZ: I think it's seen as a problem, but not seen as an urgent problem. So we heard from the Twitter whistleblower Mudge - Peiter Zatko - that things like online harassment just fall by the wayside because of the exigent problems that come up at platforms, security problems that they're forced to then throw all their resources to. And I think that's why his testimony is so powerful, along with the testimony of other tech whistleblowers that we've heard from over the past few years, because the tech companies are just putting out fires based on the problems that their platforms have created. They are not thinking proactively about the harm that their platforms can cause - or in some cases, they are actively looking the other way and really prioritizing profit over the humanity of their users. And we've seen in countries like Australia where there's an e-safety commissioner, and in the U. K. , which is pursuing an online safety bill, that, you know, the tech companies are going to have to face some more accountability for their duty of care for their users. MARTIN: Periodically, there have been moves in the U. S. Congress and elsewhere in Europe and other parts of the world to think about how these tech companies should be addressed in the public sphere, given their impact on public life, not just in the United States, but around the world. And is there any urgency around that, or does this give us an opportunity to think about that again? JANKOWICZ: You know, Michel, I've really become quite pessimistic after my own experience that both the Congress and the U. S. government are really up to the task of conducting oversight over these platforms. Again, I do not want the U. S. government to have any right to silence Americans. It does not have that right, thanks to the First Amendment. But I do think there needs to be oversight over the ways that platforms are conducting content moderation calls and the policies that allow these types of network harassment campaigns to flourish. Other countries are further ahead than we are. But I really think that the solutions, at least in the short term, are going to be in the public sphere. And that's why I'm focusing my work on non-profit advocacy campaigns rather than trying to make big overarching policy change because it just does not seem like anyone is up to the task of taking on this hugely profitable industry that is flourishing on hate. MARTIN: Before we let you go, is it possible that people could just stop using the platform? Is that a thing that could happen? JANKOWICZ: You know, I just had a conversation with my husband about this this morning. And he said, you know, what are you thinking about? If Musk buys the platform, what will you do? And I think it's really important to underline that for so many people, not just Twitter, but platforms like Facebook and Instagram, it is a really important part, not only of their social life, but of their careers. I mean, I have not only put my work out there through Twitter, I've made really important professional connections around the world. Some of my closest colleagues and friends in my sphere of work are people that I primarily got to know on Twitter. Not to mention that, you know, when I do interviews, when I publish new pieces, when I testify before Congress, I share that and expose people to these ideas using the internet. So it is a decision I've not made yet, but I think it's important to underline that it's not just about fun cat pictures online. This is a place where people increasingly live their lives and do work. And so we really need to think about, again, the tech companies' duty of care to the millions of users that are entrusting them with this significant part of their lives. MARTIN: That's Nina Jankowicz. She's a scholar who researches disinformation and its effect on democracy. Her latest book is \"How To Be A Woman Online: Surviving Abuse And Harassment, And How To Fight Back. \" Nina Jankowicz, thanks so much for sharing your expertise with us once again. JANKOWICZ: Great to be with you, as always. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:   After an on-again, off-again, at times contentious flirtation with the social media platform Twitter, tech billionaire Elon Musk says he is once again interested in buying it. On Thursday, a judge gave Musk and Twitter until October 28 to close their deal and end their months-long legal fight and avoid a high-profile trial. But the latest twist in this ongoing saga has resurfaced questions about what the popular social media site will look like under the leadership of a so-called free speech absolutist. Musk has openly criticized Twitter's policies that monitor hate speech, disinformation and online abuse, and has publicly claimed he would work to undo some of them. That made us want to reach out to Nina Jankowicz. She is a disinformation expert who's spent years researching online behavior and safety. But her interest in this, as it is for many women in public life, is not just academic. Earlier this year, she was the target of a vicious campaign of online abuse, all because she was appointed to a federal government working group aimed at combating disinformation. So we thought about what a Twitter buyout could mean for the safety of women, and for that matter, other historically marginalized groups online. That's a topic she writes about in her book, \"How To Be a Woman Online: Surviving Abuse And Harassment, And How To Fight Back. \" And she's with us once again. Nina Jankowicz, thanks so much for joining us. NINA JANKOWICZ: Great to talk to you again, Michel. MARTIN: So it seems at least somewhat likely that Musk could own Twitter by the end of the month. Of course, the story has had so many twists and turns, you know, we can't know for sure. But as a person who spends a lot of time looking at social media and engaging with it, what was your reaction to this week's news? JANKOWICZ: For a free speech absolutist to take control of a platform like Twitter, where so many people spend their time and when there's where there's a lot of debate going on, this is not just about, you know, allowing a free speech free-for-all. This is about eventually silencing marginalized voices. That free speech free-for-all is going to mean less speech for marginalized groups. Because what happens online these days - and I know this personally, as you said - is it's not just the expressly illegal content or the content that directly incites violence. And that's the stuff that Musk said he would prohibit. All the rest of the policies would go away. It's not just that stuff that is silencing for marginalized groups. What I've experienced is that, you know, you get thousands and thousands of messages that are kind of borderline in terms of violence. Some of them are directly threatening. And what that does is change your calculus about how you engage online. You know, in Brazil, which is also in election season right now, Reporters Without Borders recently did a survey that showed that 80% of women journalists in Brazil change how they interact online because they're afraid of attacks, because they want to keep themselves safe from those attacks. And if we were to remove all the protections that Twitter has, I really worry about the silencing effect that that would have for women and marginalized voices. MARTIN: Could you talk a little bit about what that was like? As we mentioned, you were appointed to chair the Disinformation Governance Board. And then you quickly became the target of an online disinformation and harassment campaign. And I just want to point out that the purpose of this was to figure out how to deal with, for example, disinformation directed at would-be migrants, disinformation directed at people spreading falsehoods about COVID vaccinations and things like that. These are public safety measures and also measures designed to keep people from making bad decisions about whether to cross the border, for example, because we know that certain sort of campaigns are directed at some of these groups. So what is that like? JANKOWICZ: Yeah. I mean, so the first thing to understand is that the entire harassment campaign was based on this foundational lie that the Disinformation Governance Board would be policing American speech. And I think it's important to note that the board had absolutely no ability or purview to take any operational action like that. That's not political spin. That's just the truth. I would not have taken the job if that were the case. And so based on this foundational lie, I had thousands of my fellow Americans sending me, you know, things ranging from just kind of curse words and insults, picking apart my physical appearance, talking about the weight that I gained during pregnancy, things like that - because I was eight months pregnant at the time. But also, you know, direct threats to me and my family, my unborn child, people saying that I should be sent to Russia and killed, people saying that I had committed treason. And this was their 1776 moment. And I should, you know, watch my back, that sort of thing. My research, as you've noted, has focused on online harassment and abuse. And so I was probably as well-prepared as I could be for these attacks. But it was still really difficult because my work is online. And, you know, a lot of my life is online, as it is for most people these days. So by encountering these messages over and over and over, every time I opened up, not just Twitter but Facebook, but Instagram, every account that I have online, basically. And I've also received, you know, mail to my home, phone calls. It really does have an effect, even for someone who prides herself on being outspoken and will not back down. MARTIN: One of the things that I think is important to point out is that women aren't the only people who are subjected to this conduct. I mean, recently The Daily Beast wrote about a science fiction writer who four years ago wrote just a tweet saying he didn't think Norm MacDonald was that funny. I mean, this is before it was known that Norm MacDonald was suffering from cancer and so forth. But he just said, I don't think he's that funny. And so he has been subjected to a campaign of vicious harassment ever since by people who seem to think it's their job to do it. I mean, he has been swatted. He's had law enforcement falsely called to his home under false pretenses, and has been completely unable to defend himself from this conduct. And frankly, it's not an exaggeration to say that people who have been targets of online harassment campaigns have taken their own lives because it was just more than they could deal with. So the question I guess I have is, why is this not seen as more of a public health or criminal justice concern? JANKOWICZ: I think it's seen as a problem, but not seen as an urgent problem. So we heard from the Twitter whistleblower Mudge - Peiter Zatko - that things like online harassment just fall by the wayside because of the exigent problems that come up at platforms, security problems that they're forced to then throw all their resources to.

And we've seen in countries like Australia where there's an e-safety commissioner, and in the U.

So the White House is working on new ways to get its message out to those audiences. NPR's Barbara Sprunt reports. BARBARA SPRUNT, BYLINE: When President Biden celebrated his major spending package at the White House last month, there were some unexpected guests invited. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Hey, besties. I was invited to the White House to celebrate the Inflation Reduction Act. And you know I'm. . . UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Y'all, this week I was invited to the White House to celebrate the passing of the Inflation Reduction Act. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: We're on the South Lawn of the White House - like, the actual White House. SPRUNT: More than 20 people were there with ring lights and audio equipment, taking it all in. It's part of a White House strategy to reach younger people where they are, which often is scrolling on a device, with help from influencers. V SPEHAR: To be at the people's house, having lemonade, waiting for the president to speak is an exciting moment. SPRUNT: That's V Spehar, host of Under the Desk News, which provides minute-long daily news wraps to 2. 7 million TikTok followers. There was a special briefing for Spehar and other content creators ahead of the ceremony. SPEHAR: I thought perhaps it was going to be similar to what we see from legacy media groups who get a press briefing from the press secretary. And this was a little bit more intimate than that. SPRUNT: They heard about the legislation directly from staff, from the Climate Policy Office, the National Economic Council. Even President Biden and Vice President Harris dropped in. SPEHAR: Honestly, I don't care what side of the aisle you are on. When the president and the vice president walks in a room, it's a cool moment. SPRUNT: This isn't the first time the White House has worked with influencers. Spehar was part of a virtual briefing earlier this year on the war in Ukraine, a briefing that caught the attention of \"Saturday Night Live. \"(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE\")JAMES AUSTIN JOHNSON: (As Joe Biden) I also want to thank my press secretary, Jen Psaki, for having the vision to set this up. KATE MCKINNON: (As Jen Psaki) I suggested it as a joke, and then it actually happened. (LAUGHTER)SPRUNT: Spehar can laugh at that a bit. SPEHAR: Legacy media had a good time making a joke about TikTokers being invited to a White House briefing. It just showed how out of touch people are with what the current state of communication is for young people. SPRUNT: A. B. Burns-Tucker is known as @iamlegallyhype on TikTok. She was at that celebration last month, too. She says there's a lot of misconceptions about what exactly an influencer is. A B BURNS-TUCKER: At first, it was just the flat tummy tea girls, right? And now you see people like me and others who are outside of mainstream news, and people are gravitating to the information that we present. SPRUNT: Burns-Tucker is a law student and shares political and legal content. She says the briefing was helpful in putting things in context, and she has more posts in the works. Her 600,000 followers had a mostly positive reaction to her visit. BURNS-TUCKER: Some people were like, all right, cool. Like, now I could get some solar panels, right? Like, now, you know, my granny and them prescriptions are going to be cheaper. SPRUNT: But there was some skepticism. BURNS-TUCKER: One of the things is always like, oh, you went to the White House. So now you're going to say whatever the White House tell you to say. And it's like, no. Just because I earn my space doesn't mean I'm going to be a puppet for somebody. SPRUNT: The White House told the influencers they recognize they're independent. Here's Rob Flaherty, director of digital strategy. ROB FLAHERTY: We're not expecting them to become Biden administration propagandists, but we want to make sure that they have the best information that they can get and be able to ask questions just like reporters would. SPRUNT: Presidents have long recognized the benefits of pop culture. Tevi Troy, a presidential historian, says presidents have been experimenting with technology for more than a century. TEVI TROY: It's really with the growth of social media that you have presidents that have the ability to aim for specific audiences that they want to reach and put out the tailored message without going through the various filters of the news media. SPRUNT: But there are potential pitfalls, just like with any other media. TROY: They may not be sophisticated political actors. They may not be policy-focused. And so maybe they said, OK, I'll go to the White House. But I'm not going to do much else for them. SPRUNT: In fact, some of the group last month didn't seem to post much beyond a selfie. Yini Zhang, a SUNY Buffalo professor studying social media, says working with influencers to spread messaging is smart but warns it can be complicated. YINI ZHANG: It's a two-sided coin because social media influencers - they definitely can expand the reach of public policies. But the downside is that they're not professional information gatherers. SPRUNT: The currency on social media is attention. And Zhang says keeping things short and buzzy could affect the quality of the content. ZHANG: They might have to tailor their information for engagement. SPRUNT: But so far, the White House is encouraged. And there's more briefings in the pipeline on climate, clean energy tax credits and lowering the costs of prescription drugs. Barbara Sprunt, NPR News, Washington.

People convey messages by what they say and also the way they say it. And the voice may also help doctors to diagnose conditions. Dr. Yael Bensoussan directs the Health Voice Center at the University of South Florida. YAEL BENSOUSSAN: When we talk about the human voice, we talk about the sound that the vocal cords make, sounds like E, the way that the vocal cords vibrate, but also the way we speak. And speech is the way we articulate the sound, the way the sound goes into what we call our resonators - the nose cavity, the mouth cavity - and the way we use our breathing to talk. LEILA FADEL, HOST:  Dr. Bensoussan says the voice gives her clues to five main categories of conditions. BENSOUSSAN: The first one is neurological disorders, like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, ALS. Then we have voice disorders, like laryngeal cancer. Then we have mood disorders. We know that we can find a lot of changes in voice in depression and mood disorders. Fourth categories is respiratory disorders. People with lung diseases can cough a different way. And then the last one is pediatric disorders, like autism and speech delays. INSKEEP: So what do those variations sound like? Here's an example - a voice with vocal fold paralysis from the Voice Foundation at St. John's University. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: The blue spot is on the key again. How hard did he hit him? FADEL: And here's the voice of someone with cancer in their larynx, also from the Voice Foundation at St. John's University. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: The blue spot is the key again. How hard did it hit him? FADEL: And a voice of someone diagnosed with Parkinson's from a company called SpeechVive. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: When sunlight strikes rainbows in the air, they act like a prism and form a rainbow. BENSOUSSAN: Somebody with Parkinson's disease not only has a lower voice so that usually the frequency of the voice is a little bit lower; the speed of the way they speak is a little bit lower, more monotonous. FADEL: Now with funding from NIH, Dr. Bensoussan and her co-director on the project are attempting to build an app to help diagnose diseases by listening to the quality of someone's voice. BENSOUSSAN: We're developing the database for researchers to have access and also the tool to capture the voice. INSKEEP: Yeah. As more people upload their voices to this app and the database grows, the algorithm's disease detection accuracy may improve. The researchers plan to include many voices to ensure their data is reflective of the population. BENSOUSSAN: Training an algorithm on a group of 30 white males that are all 70 years old is not going to give good accuracy. And that's why serving the remote communities and underserved communities - it's so important. We want to capture the voices of these people as well that are underrepresented to make sure that the tools we develop are applicable to them. FADEL: So can an app like this replace a regular medical screening in the future? Dr. Bensoussan says, no. She says the app will only flag signs of disease. BENSOUSSAN: A family doctor, for example, that's in a remote community could use our tools and record the voice of the patients, put in the history, and the app could say, there's a very high chance this is cancer, actually. You should definitely have them seen by an expert in a very timely manner. INSKEEP: Of course, if you're giving clues about yourself through your voice, that does raise privacy concerns. So the doctor says they have a team of bioethicists on board. BENSOUSSAN: We know that technology can do crazy things. So it's kind of our job and our responsibility to make sure we put boundaries to that. INSKEEP: Dr. Bensoussan says with the help of other researchers, it should take around four years to develop a tool that can help doctors with diagnosis and screening.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: When sunlight strikes rainbows in the air, they act like a prism and form a rainbow. BENSOUSSAN: Somebody with Parkinson's disease not only has a lower voice so that usually the frequency of the voice is a little bit lower; the speed of the way they speak is a little bit lower, more monotonous. FADEL: Now with funding from NIH, Dr. Bensoussan and her co-director on the project are attempting to build an app to help diagnose diseases by listening to the quality of someone's voice. BENSOUSSAN: We're developing the database for researchers to have access and also the tool to capture the voice. INSKEEP: Yeah. As more people upload their voices to this app and the database grows, the algorithm's disease detection accuracy may improve. The researchers plan to include many voices to ensure their data is reflective of the population. BENSOUSSAN: Training an algorithm on a group of 30 white males that are all 70 years old is not going to give good accuracy. And that's why serving the remote communities and underserved communities - it's so important. We want to capture the voices of these people as well that are underrepresented to make sure that the tools we develop are applicable to them. FADEL: So can an app like this replace a regular medical screening in the future? Dr. Bensoussan says, no. She says the app will only flag signs of disease. BENSOUSSAN: A family doctor, for example, that's in a remote community could use our tools and record the voice of the patients, put in the history, and the app could say, there's a very high chance this is cancer, actually. You should definitely have them seen by an expert in a very timely manner. INSKEEP: Of course, if you're giving clues about yourself through your voice, that does raise privacy concerns. So the doctor says they have a team of bioethicists on board. BENSOUSSAN: We know that technology can do crazy things. So it's kind of our job and our responsibility to make sure we put boundaries to that. INSKEEP: Dr. Bensoussan says with the help of other researchers, it should take around four years to develop a tool that can help doctors with diagnosis and screening.

S. and Russia are facing off again, but this time it's not over Ukraine. It's over leadership of a little-known international tech agency that's been around since the mid-1800s. The International Telecommunication Union was created to help standardize the telegraph, but it could be the place where the future of the internet is decided. NPR cybersecurity correspondent Jenna McLaughlin has the story. JENNA MCLAUGHLIN, BYLINE: For Karen Kornbluh, it's a question of a free and open internet. KAREN KORNBLUH: You know, in countries around the world, can citizens really know what's going on in their own countries abroad? And can they organize with each other, and can they be safe from surveillance? MCLAUGHLIN: Kornbluh is a senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund. She's been closely watching an election an ocean away, between an American and a Russian candidate. The American, Doreen Bogdan-Martin, touts unfettered internet access for everyone. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)DOREEN BOGDAN-MARTIN: My vision is to enable a trusted, connected digital future for all. MCLAUGHLIN: Her opponent wants countries to have more control over how their citizens connect. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)RASHID ISMAILOV: I'm Rashid Ismailov, nominated by Russian Federation. MCLAUGHLIN: Both were vying to lead something called the International Telecommunication Union. KORNBLUH: It's the most important agency you've never heard of. MCLAUGHLIN: The agency has been making sure people can communicate around the world since the 1860s, after something called the telegraph was invented. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: In Paris, the rulers of an uneasy world came to terms, faced with a new machine which abolished time and space. MCLAUGHLIN: In the 1960s, the U. N. produced a short film to mark 100 years of the ITU. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Already, the lines of the telegraph stretched out and dared to cross the frontiers of sovereign states. MCLAUGHLIN: The ITU does a lot of important work. It's the reason your cell phone works at home as well as in Toronto or Tokyo. (SOUNDBITE OF PHONE RINGING TONE AND DIAL-UP TONE)MCLAUGHLIN: The ITU is also responsible for allocating radio bandwidth for everything from high-speed internet to HDTV. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: A huge 82-inch and a 65-inch - two for one, just 17. 99. Whoa. MCLAUGHLIN: These same kinds of technological advances helped me reach Ambassador Erica Barks-Ruggles in Bucharest. ERICA BARKS-RUGGLES: If there weren't frequencies set aside for things like WhatsApp, which we're calling on, we wouldn't be able to do this either. MCLAUGHLIN: She's the head of the U. S. delegation to the ITU conference. The U. S. is backing Doreen Bogdan-Martin at a moment when competition with Russia and China in all domains is so intense. BOGDAN-MARTIN: She has a vision - putting right at the very front of her vision - connecting the 2. 7 billion unconnected people in the world. MCLAUGHLIN: In a first, President Biden threw his weight behind the American candidate. But in the Trump era, and even before, dating back to 9/11, there was less focus on these obscure international agencies. The thing is, their members make a lot of really key decisions. Without the U. S. taking a lead role, Russia and China felt emboldened to push for their policies, including inside the International Telecommunication Union. One of those policies is to allow individual countries more power over how the internet works. In Bucharest, Erica Barks-Ruggles says the U. S. believes in total openness. BARKS-RUGGLES: There are others who disagree with that - who would like to be able to control when their citizens can talk to other people and what they can talk to them about, sometimes within their own countries - we've all heard about the Great Firewall - but also between countries. MCLAUGHLIN: Of course, when Russia and China are pitching their vision to other countries, they don't always sell it so bluntly. JUSTIN SHERMAN: Sometimes they go into a country's shore and they say, this is a way for you to stifle dissent. MCLAUGHLIN: Justin Sherman is a fellow at the Atlantic Council. SHERMAN: But in many cases, they say the West has dominated the internet since its inception. Silicon Valley is out of control. This is not about empowering China. This is not about empowering Russia. This is about empowering you. MCLAUGHLIN: Getting back to that election in Bucharest, the reality is that the U. S. has been genuinely worried about the outcome. The result would be decided by a secret ballot, which means countries could vote in Russia's favor without anybody knowing. And so on the morning of September 29 in Bucharest, the winner was announced. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BOGDAN-MARTIN: Distinguished colleagues, ladies and gentlemen. . . MCLAUGHLIN: Doreen Bogdan-Martin prevailed. She got 139 votes out of 172 - the first woman to be ITU's leader ever. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BOGDAN-MARTIN: I am deeply, deeply humbled and filled with emotion. MCLAUGHLIN: Now the work begins. Members of the ITU will meet until mid-October, talking about everything from artificial intelligence to cybersecurity. But Chinese companies, like Huawei - they still want to take the lead in forging the future of 5G, setting the standards, convincing other countries that their vision is better. Justin Sherman at the Atlantic Council doesn't think it's going to be easy for the U. S. SHERMAN: The Chinese government will continue trying to influence the ITU. This victory is a good thing, but the hard work doesn't stop. MCLAUGHLIN: Even so, this is a unique moment for the U. S. to grab hold. The war in Ukraine might not be on the agenda at the conference, but it's on everyone's mind in Bucharest. The leader of the U. S. delegation, Erica Barks-Ruggles, says the message from other countries to Russia is pretty clear. BARKS-RUGGLES: Communication infrastructure has been destroyed. Economies have been strained. A number of countries around the world have suffered shortages of grain and oil and things like this. And I think that they're saying, this is not the way we want the world run. MCLAUGHLIN: A world that's moved way past the telegraph, but where nations are still fighting age-old battles. Jenna McLaughlin, NPR News. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SACHA PFEIFFER, HOST:   The U.

DAN CHARLES, BYLINE: Northeast of San Diego, up a steep winding road and on the other side of a locked gate, there's a place that could store a huge amount of electricity. (SOUNDBITE OF GATE SQUEAKING)CHARLES: Wow, this is so cool. I'm on top of a 300-foot-tall dam looking out at 2 1/2 square miles of water. NEENA KUZMICH: And that's the San Vicente Reservoir. CHARLES: Neena Kuzmich is deputy director of engineering at the San Diego Water Authority, which runs this place. The lake is gorgeous, surrounded by steep, barren mountainsides. But Kuzmich did not bring me here for the view. Remember what happened on September 6, she says. KUZMICH: Everybody in the state of California, I believe, got a text message at 5:30 in the evening to turn off their appliances. CHARLES: California's electrical grid was hitting its limit because the sun was going down, and so was all of the state's solar power. And yet earlier that same day, there was so much solar power available in California that the grid couldn't take it all. Enough electricity to power a small city was turned away, wasted because they couldn't store it for later when they really needed it. KUZMICH: We have a problem if we're going to have these continuous heat waves. We need something - we need a facility that will store energy so we can't - we don't have to turn off our appliances. CHARLES: Well, the San Diego Water Authority is hoping, maybe a decade from now, it could take all that extra solar power in the middle of the day and use it to pump water from this reservoir through big underground pipes up into a new, smaller reservoir a thousand feet higher. KUZMICH: The upper reservoir would be up behind those mountains here that you see in front of you. CHARLES: And then when the sun goes down and they really need the power, they'd open a valve and the force of 8 million tons of water falling back downhill would spin turbines and generate electricity. KUZMICH: It's a water battery. CHARLES: Big water batteries like this, called pumped hydro facilities, do exist already in dozens of places around the U. S. Many were built to store electricity that nuclear power plants generated during the night. Malcolm Woolf, president and CEO of the National Hydropower Association, says nobody's built a big new one in more than a generation. MALCOLM WOOLF: But in just the last several years, 92 projects have come into the developing pipeline. CHARLES: Pumping water has some advantages over batteries, like the ones in electric cars. It can store a lot of power. That San Diego project could supply 100,000 homes for 8 hours or so. It doesn't require hard-to-find battery materials like cobalt and lithium. And the plants last for a century. The problem, at least according to some people, is it's hard to find places to build such things. WOOLF: That is a myth that I am working hard to try to disabuse folks of. CHARLES: Woolf says you don't even need a river for pumped storage - just two reservoirs, one high, one low, reusing the same water over and over in a closed loop. Kelly Catlett, who's director of hydropower reform at American Rivers, an environmental advocacy group, says this technology is certainly worth considering.

Yes, people who talk about the 2020 election - which Donald Trump lost, according to dozens of courts and officials from both parties - have seized an opportunity to talk instead about similar claims in another country. Here's NPR's Shannon Bond. SHANNON BOND, BYLINE: The morning after Brazilians voted in the first round, Donald Trump's former adviser, Steve Bannon, said on his podcast that Brazil was a. . . (SOUNDBITE OF PODCAST, \"WAR ROOM\")STEVE BANNON: Very stark warning to MAGA and to all the Republicans of the games that are being played in these elections. BOND: Bannon's guest, conservative activist Matthew Tyrmand piled on with a string of false and baseless allegations. (SOUNDBITE OF PODCAST, \"WAR ROOM\")MATTHEW TYRMAND: People are absolutely crying fraud in Brazil because it's the same thing we saw in 2020 - Smartmatic machines. BOND: Now, if the name Smartmatic sounds familiar, it's because the company, and another voting machine maker called Dominion Voting Systems, were targeted in 2020 by American conspiracists who falsely claimed their software was used to flip votes from Trump to Joe Biden. The companies have filed multiple defamation suits over those lies. But now those same claims are circulating online about Brazil, even though neither Smartmatic nor Dominion's voting machines are being used there. LEE FOSTER: It shows just how sticky these narratives are. BOND: Lee Foster is an analyst at the Alethea Group, which tracks false and misleading claims. FOSTER: Once they gain traction, people will start applying those to other kind of events and build out these broad conspiracy theories around them. BOND: Foster and his team have seen these falsehoods across a wide variety of social media sites. Some were posted in Portuguese, but many were in English, suggesting this narrative is aimed at people in America, as well as Brazil. The posts pointed to how Bolsonaro's early lead evaporated as the vote counting continued, claiming, without evidence, that this was proof of manipulation. And many commenters, including Bannon, used the allegations about Brazil to suggest the midterm elections underway in the U. S. will also be rigged. Foster says this is how conspiracy theories are built and sustained. FOSTER: You know, it becomes this kind of self-feedback loop. It just continues to grow, almost kind of like a snowball effect. BOND: Madeline Peltz of the liberal group Media Matters for America says Bannon has been calling for his audience to get involved as poll watchers and election workers, all in service of defeating what he describes as a global conspiracy by the left to steal their way into power. MADELINE PELTZ: Diving into the Brazilian election to keep these election lies alive in the States is really a natural extension of the political projects that Bannon has going in the States right now. BOND: Brazil is not the only place where U. S. -centric hoaxes about voting machines have crossed borders. In Australia, false rumors spread on social media claiming Dominion machines were being used in its election earlier this year - never mind that Australians don't vote electronically, says Tom Rogers, the country's electoral commissioner. TOM ROGERS: I have the pleasure of being the CEO of one of the world's last great analog events where people use paper and pencil to vote. So if you're going to pick a conspiracy theory, you'd think you'd pick one that maybe had more traction. BOND: Rogers and his staff moved quickly to debunk the rumors, posting YouTube videos and pithy replies on Twitter, which he credits for preventing the claims from going megaviral. ROGERS: It's actually not that elections are necessarily globally doing anything worse than they always were. It was the collapse in the reputation of those systems as a result of mis-, disinformation, conspiracy theories. BOND: And eroding trust in the fundamentals of democracy, like voting, is exactly what these lies are intended to do - in Brazil and here in the U. S. Shannon Bond, NPR News.

As we know, debunking rumors and false information online can be challenging, so some are trying a new approach - pre-bunking. NPR's Shannon Bond is with us now to explain how it works. Shannon, thanks so much for joining us. SHANNON BOND, BYLINE: Thanks for having me, Michel. MARTIN: OK, so what's pre-bunking? BOND: The basic idea is to show people what misleading or false information looks like before they encounter it in the wild so that they're better equipped to recognize and resist it. And it stems from this field of social psychology research called inoculation theory, which is kind of what it sounds like. Here's Beth Goldberg. She's a researcher at Google's Jigsaw Unit, which develops technology to counter online threats. BETH GOLDBERG: So it's a little bit like getting physically inoculated against a disease that you might run into in the future. In this case, it's being sort of mentally prepared to encounter misleading information in the future. BOND: And there's a growing body of academic research into inoculation theory and pre-bunking. And now some of those lessons are being applied in the real world. MARTIN: So help us understand what that looks like. BOND: Yeah. So one example - we're seeing election officials around the country putting out infographics and tip sheets on social media. And these have reminders to do things like think critically about what you see and hear. You know, where does that video or post come from? Whose interest does it serve? - and emphasizing that election agencies are the best source of election information. I spoke with Amy Cohen, who runs the National Association of State Election Directors, which put out a toolkit with a lot of this material. AMY COHEN: Understanding election processes requires more than 280 characters. It's complicated, and it's nuanced. And election officials never have the biggest megaphone and, unfortunately, are just never the loudest voices in the room. BOND: And the idea is to help these officials, you know, fill some of the information gap that otherwise bad actors could do. You know, they'll let them know - people know where to go if they have questions about voting processes or maybe to pause and think if you see a viral story or a video. MARTIN: So are social media companies are using this strategy? And if so, how? BOND: Yeah, and this is where Twitter comes into it. It's been one of the biggest proponents of this pre-bunking strategy, and the folks who run trust and safety there told me they see it as a companion to a lot of the other work they do - you know, things like labeling misleading tweets with fact checks, removing coordinated manipulation. So for the midterm elections, Twitter's put together collections of tweets from journalists, fact-checkers, government officials, you know, what they consider authoritative sources with context about things like electronic voting, mail-in ballots, you know where to vote. It's also done pre-bunks in Brazil, where people are voting in the presidential runoff election this weekend. And Twitter says its user surveys show that similar pre-bunks in 2020 were effective. MARTIN: Well, since we're talking about Twitter, Elon Musk, as we said, now owns the social network. He has made it clear that he's called himself a so-called free speech absolutist. But what do we know about what that actually means now that he actually owns the company? Do we know anything about how he may change Twitter's approach to misleading and false claims? BOND: Yeah, I mean, he says he thinks the platform's rules against things like misinformation, hate speech, harassment are too restrictive. But he's also said it can't be a free-for-all hell zone that would turn off advertisers. You know, even just since Elon took over, we've already seen an uptick in people posting racist slurs and hate speech on Twitter. On Friday, Musk tweeted he's going to create a Content moderation council and won't make any big decisions before then. As for what that means for Twitter and pre-bunking, we don't know, but we'll be watching. MARTIN: That's NPR's Shannon Bond. Shannon, thank you. BOND: Thank you.

It took a lawsuit. But Elon Musk now owns one of the most influential speech platforms in the world. How will Twitter change under Elon Musk? What does it mean for speech online? We're joined now by NPR tech reporter Bobby Allyn. Bobby, thanks so much for being with us. BOBBY ALLYN, BYLINE: Morning, Scott. SIMON: We've seen a few changes already, haven't we? ALLYN: We have. Musk came in and fired the CEO. He canned other upper management. He then tweeted, quote, \"The bird is freed,\" which apparently is a reference to Twitter's blue bird logo. Musk reportedly has considered laying off 75% of the staff, something that really has people inside of the company on edge. In terms of changes to Twitter itself, you know, we're still in the early innings of Twitter's Elon era, so hard to say right now. But he has promised a whole host of changes, including relaxing rules against things like hate speech and harassment, unbanning controversial figures like former President Trump and cracking down on spam bots. These are just a few of the items from his wish list. SIMON: Pew Research says that about a quarter of adults in the United States use Twitter. They are more likely to be under 30 years of age and to lean toward the left politically. Are they going to notice big changes? ALLYN: Again, it's too early to say. Musk says, though, that he will not be making any major decisions on platform rules or on Twitter account reinstatements until he forms what he is calling a content moderation panel. He also has long said he's - like I mentioned - he's going to roll back content moderation rules. But what's interesting is he also is saying he doesn't want Twitter to turn into, quote, \"a free-for-all hellscape. \" Good luck with that balance. But already, online safety groups and civil rights organizations and others are deeply worried that Musk is going to unleash, you know, a tsunami of bullies, hate speech, misinformation and other sludge to the platform, which would be really bad for advertisers. And at the end of the day, that's how Twitter butters its bread. SIMON: Of course, people are already voting in midterm elections. What do you see, Bobby, as political implications for a revamped Twitter? ALLYN: Yeah, some of the most poisonous misinformation campaigns involve elected officials and election falsehoods. And, you know, whether bad actors try to manipulate the platform to, you know, achieve some kind of political ends remains to be seen. But yeah, if these changes create vulnerabilities, they might be exploited, and that could be a real problem for our electoral process. SIMON: Of course, Donald Trump was permanently banned from Twitter following the January 6 attack on Congress. Elon Musk at one point said that he would reinstate Trump's Twitter account. Have we heard from Donald Trump? ALLYN: Yes, we have. Trump wrote on his own social media site, Truth Social, that Twitter is now, quote, \"in sane hands. \" But his return is far from certain because Trump himself has said he doesn't want to come back to Twitter. He says he prefers his own site, Truth Social. Now, I'm personally skeptical that he won't return to the platform, especially because he's publicly weighing another run for president. And it's just hard to see the rise of Trump without Twitter, right? It helped shape him as a political animal. It helped him find an enormous national fan base. Now, researchers I've talked to have said since Trump left Twitter, disinformation across the whole platform has dropped in a pretty meaningful way. But will he come back? Will Elon extend an invitation? Probably, but just not sure when exactly. SIMON: NPR's Bobby Allyn, thanks so much. ALLYN: Thank you, Scott. SCOTT SIMON, HOST:   It took months. It took a lawsuit.

And at the end of the day, that's how Twitter butters its bread. SIMON: Of course, people are already voting in midterm elections. What do you see, Bobby, as political implications for a revamped Twitter? ALLYN: Yeah, some of the most poisonous misinformation campaigns involve elected officials and election falsehoods. And, you know, whether bad actors try to manipulate the platform to, you know, achieve some kind of political ends remains to be seen. But yeah, if these changes create vulnerabilities, they might be exploited, and that could be a real problem for our electoral process. SIMON: Of course, Donald Trump was permanently banned from Twitter following the January 6 attack on Congress. Elon Musk at one point said that he would reinstate Trump's Twitter account. Have we heard from Donald Trump? ALLYN: Yes, we have. Trump wrote on his own social media site, Truth Social, that Twitter is now, quote, \"in sane hands. \" But his return is far from certain because Trump himself has said he doesn't want to come back to Twitter. He says he prefers his own site, Truth Social. Now, I'm personally skeptical that he won't return to the platform, especially because he's publicly weighing another run for president. And it's just hard to see the rise of Trump without Twitter, right? It helped shape him as a political animal. It helped him find an enormous national fan base. Now, researchers I've talked to have said since Trump left Twitter, disinformation across the whole platform has dropped in a pretty meaningful way. But will he come back? Will Elon extend an invitation? Probably, but just not sure when exactly. SIMON: NPR's Bobby Allyn, thanks so much.

Researchers and the company's own staff have identified a coordinated campaign to spread hate on the platform. Musk himself has shared an unfounded conspiracy theory about Nancy Pelosi's husband. And to talk about all of this, we're joined now by NPR's Shannon Bond, who covers online platforms. Hey, Shannon. SHANNON BOND, BYLINE: Hey, Ailsa. CHANG: Hey. OK, so as we said, we are just a few days into the Elon Musk era on Twitter. How are things going? BOND: Well, Ailsa, this is Elon Musk we're talking about. So, of course, it's controversial. Now, he has never been shy - right? - especially in how he uses Twitter. You know, he has more than 100 million followers there. He's long used his account to provoke, to tease, to troll. And now he's doing these things but from a position of a lot more power. And, you know, that means that worries about what his ownership will augur for this company were really exacerbated this weekend, when he posted this baseless, lurid conspiracy theory about the violent attack on Nancy Pelosi's husband, Paul. Now, this came from a fringe website with a long history of posting fake stories. Now, Musk eventually did delete the tweet hours later but not until it had already been, you know, retweeted and liked tens of thousands of times. CHANG: Wow. BOND: And I think this matters, right? CHANG: Yeah. BOND: 'Cause now he is the one calling all the shots here. He's fired the company's leadership. Today he dissolved its board. It's just him. CHANG: OK, well, that's just one tweet in particular. But I imagine we are seeing broader changes - right? - across Twitter. BOND: Yeah. I mean, I think you remember that Musk said before he owned Twitter that he wanted to unleash more free speech on the platform. He has previously said he thinks all legal speech should be permitted there, no matter how offensive or harmful. Now, last week he walked that back a bit. He said it couldn't be a free-for-all hellscape. You know, he doesn't want to scare off advertisers, which are how Twitter makes money. But as soon as news broke on Thursday that he had taken control of Twitter, we saw plenty of people celebrating this idea that he is going to get rid of what they see as censorship on the platform. I spoke with Sara Aniano, a disinformation analyst at the Anti-Defamation League. SARA ANIANO: Elon Musk has said enough on Twitter even before his take over to make people believe that he is on the side of saying whatever you want without consequences. CHANG: Yeah. So then what's been the impact of those words? Can we tell? BOND: Well, Aniano and her colleagues have been tracking what's happening on Twitter, and they found that since Musk took over on Thursday, users have posted thousands of tweets and retweets with anti-Semitic memes. There's also been reporting about a rise in racist slurs. I took a look at Twitter data and you can see a definite increase in the use of several racist and homophobic slurs in just the past few days. The researchers say this is being driven by a coordinated campaign on platforms popular with the far right, at least in some cases here. And, you know, we're seeing people encouraging each other to amplify these hateful posts on Twitter. CHANG: Well, how has Twitter responded to all of this so far? BOND: Well, Musk and the company didn't respond to requests for comment. But on Friday Twitter's head of safety tweeted that they are aware of a coordinated campaign to post hate speech and are banning these accounts. In fact, he said just 300 accounts were responsible for more than 50,000 tweets using one slur. Musk himself last week posted to clarify that no changes have been made to Twitter's existing rules. He says he's going to create a content moderation council of people with diverse views and won't make any big decisions before then, including things like bringing back President Donald Trump, who was - or former President Donald Trump, who was banned. I think, Ailsa, though, what the past few days have shown is that even without making any actual changes to Twitter policy, Musk is making his mark. And there's a group of people who are feeling emboldened by his ownership. They are already having an impact. CHANG: Indeed. That is NPR's Shannon Bond. Thank you, Shannon. BOND: Thanks, Ailsa.

(SOUNDBITE OF DROP ELECTRIC SONG, \"WAKING UP TO THE FIRE\")WAILIN WONG, HOST:  The brightest flashlight app was developed for something very simple. This was during the time when a lot of Android phones didn't have built-in flashlights like the iPhone. So this app would turn on all the available lights, essentially making the phone into a flashlight. DARIAN WOODS, HOST:  But the brightest flashlight was also doing something else. It was recording users' locations and sending that information to advertisers. And this landed the company in hot water with the Federal Trade Commission. WONG: That was almost a decade ago. Since then, the market for location data has continued to flourish. It is a multibillion-dollar industry where information on people's precise whereabouts is still being collected from mobile apps and sold to companies or government agencies, often without users' knowledge or direct consent. This is THE INDICATOR FROM PLANET MONEY. I'm Wailin Wong. WOODS: And I'm Darian Woods. Today on the show, we're going to look at mobile location data, how it's gathered, sold and used. And we're going to talk to one developer about his experience to try to build a weather app that takes privacy seriously. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)WONG: Our phones contain a treasure trove of information about us - what we're watching, buying, searching for and where we are. LENA GHAMRAWI: Precise geolocation data is really your longitude and latitude, so exactly where you are. Like, you are in your living room in your apartment. WONG: Lena Ghamrawi's a privacy lawyer. A couple of years ago, she helped launch a watchdog group that investigated mobile apps. This was also when more investigative journalism was coming out about the industry. Like in 2020, Vice reported that the U. S. military was buying location data collected from a variety of apps. GHAMRAWI: Usually what happens is that apps are collecting information about you. The apps then turn around and sell that information to data brokers, third parties who then package that data, repurpose it and then sell it to anyone that wants to buy the data. WOODS: Lena says location data can be helpful. Like, say, an epidemiologist wants to track the spread of infectious diseases in a population, or a real estate company might want to analyze foot traffic patterns when deciding where to open a store. WONG: And then there are apps that simply wouldn't work without knowing their users' locations. Think of navigation and mapping apps or ride-sharing apps like Lyft and Uber. GHAMRAWI: So it's not all nefarious and bad, but unfortunately, the way that it's been used today has exploited individuals because this information is really sensitive. WOODS: One high-profile example from last year involved a Catholic priest. He resigned after a news site claimed to have linked his phone with data showing that he had visited gay bars and used the location-based dating app Grindr. WONG: And location data came under renewed scrutiny after Roe v. Wade was overturned. Congress is investigating privacy concerns related to period tracking apps and how they collect data, including location. And in August, the FTC sued a data broker named Kochava. It said the company's data could be used to track people visiting sensitive places like reproductive health clinics and domestic violence shelters. WOODS: So how does location data get from an app to a data broker to companies that are paying for this information? Lena says that often the app developers have no idea that this data is being collected in the first place, and that's because of something called software development kits or SDKs. GHAMRAWI: Basically, they're pieces of code that app developers use when creating an app instead of writing the code from scratch. WONG: So think about making spaghetti. You could spend hours simmering a complex bolognaise sauce on the stove. Or you could buy a jar of pre-made sauce and get dinner on the table in 15 minutes. WOODS: Yeah. So SDKs are these pre-made, jarred pasta sauces of the mobile app industry. They contain pre-made software for functions like taking credit card payments or sending instant messages. WONG: So SDKs can be very useful. But unbeknownst to app developers, some SDK creators insert location tracking capabilities into their software and sell that data to brokers. GHAMRAWI: What happens a lot of time is that the SDK has what we call invisible code, and the code can then extract your location information. And the app developers actually sometimes don't even know that they're putting this into the app. WOODS: Some developers choose to avoid SDKs altogether for this very reason, developers like Brian Mueller. BRIAN MUELLER: I'm Brian Mueller, and I'm the founder of CARROT Weather, this snarky, little weather app that has this personality built into it. WOODS: I'm sick of these vanilla weather apps, Wailin. WONG: Yeah. Well, if you want a weather app kind of spicing up your life, CARROT Weather might be your thing because. . . WOODS: OK. WONG: . . . Every time you open this app, you are greeted with a rude message. WOODS: OK. WONG: Like, if it's sunny and warm, CARROT might say. . . AUTOMATED VOICE: I hope you get a horrible sunburn. WOODS: This is quite the app. I don't know why people would want this in their life, but maybe, I don't know, self-flagellation is a thing. WONG: Maybe just to feel alive. WOODS: To feel alive, you know. I have learned that CARROT's personality is pretty acerbic, and it's sometimes bordering on homicidal. But one thing that CARROT does not do, despite being a weather app, is collect and store precise location data. WONG: A few years ago, when Brian started reading about how invisible code could be lurking inside SDKs, he decided to remove them from his app. He also doesn't sell ads because he didn't want to expose his customers' data to third-party advertising companies. MUELLER: I remember joking that CARROT wants your location data so that she can use it to, like, send an assassin after you, not give it to someone else to market stuff to you. WOODS: So one challenge for Brian is that he has to rely on third-party weather data providers, you know, the companies that actually do the forecasts. And he can't control what those companies do with his customers' data. So he's built a couple of safeguards. WONG: For example, he puts his own servers in between his customers and the weather data providers. That way, those companies don't see his customers' IP addresses. They only see requests coming from Brian's servers. MUELLER: And another thing that I do is my requests to the weather data providers don't use the most precise GPS coordinates. I round those coordinates up so that they'll never be able to, like, say that this user is at this specific address. WOODS: Brian says though as a consumer, he personally doesn't mind his location being used for targeted ads. And this is a pretty common mindset. Like, our online experience can be more tailored to our interests because of the information that we provide to apps and advertisers. And ads are what enables so many apps and services to be free. WONG: But the conversation around how sensitive personal information gets used is prompting people like Brian to take a hard look at the tradeoffs between privacy, convenience and, in his case, making a living as an app developer. MUELLER: There are so many cases out there where location data can be used to really hurt people, and that's the kind of stuff that I don't want to contribute to. WOODS: Both Brian and Lena say that because the U. S. doesn't have a federal privacy law like Europe's GDPR law, it's largely been left up to individual companies and developers to figure out their own policies. WONG: Apple, for example, introduced privacy features last year that let iPhone users opt out of getting tracked by advertisers. Privacy advocates applauded the features, but those changes also resulted in billions of lost dollars in ad revenue and sales for companies. WOODS: And for individual people like Lena, the Wild West nature of the mobile app industry means that she has to stay personally vigilant not only for herself but her parents, too, who aren't as tech savvy as she is. GHAMRAWI: I look at their phone, and I'm like, do you really need these apps? WONG: What's, like, the most random app you found on your parent's phone where you're like, no, you don't need this? GHAMRAWI: My mom had this, like, flower of the day app. WONG: (Laughter) That sounds nice. GHAMRAWI: I was like, what is this? And she was like, I don't know. It looked nice. And so I was like, you don't need this. WOODS: Well, a sunflower might look nice, but you can also get insulted by a really mean weather app if you want. WONG: Who wouldn't want that? AUTOMATED VOICE: Twenty-four thousand people are killed by lightning every year. Will you be one of them? (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)WONG: Well, that estimate sounds a little high, but I wouldn't dare contradict CARROT. She will come for me. WOODS: I wouldn't either. She knows where you live, maybe not the address but where you live generally. WONG: This episode was produced by Nicky Ouellet, with engineering by Katherine Silva. Dylan Sloan checked the facts.

Sometimes, in lieu of a female dummy, researchers use a smaller version of the male one, about the size of a 12-year-old girl. Well, a team of Swedish engineers is working to change this. Astrid Linder leads the team. She joins us now on the line from Sweden. Hi there. Welcome. ASTRID LINDER: Hi there. KELLY: What's the difference from the male dummy? LINDER: First of all, the height and weight. And also, this model has - is developed specifically for low severity rear impact. So we have a very strong focus on on how the torso looks like. And there we have some geometrical differences between males and females, but we also have differences in joint stiffnesses. And females have less muscles and with a lower total strength, which correspond to a lower stiffness between the joints. KELLY: We do have data on how women's injuries in car accidents may differ from men's. What is some of that? LINDER: Yeah, the biggest difference is when it comes to, like, whiplash injury from low-severity crashes. And there we know since the late '60s that females have a higher risk of these injuries than men. But we also know from higher-severity crashes that females have a higher risk of severe injuries as drivers in frontal impacts. KELLY: Have you been able to run tests yet with the new female dummy you have developed? LINDER: Yeah, we have run tests both with the male and the female because they come as a pair, of course. KELLY: What have you found? LINDER: We did test with different seats, and there we found that you could get quite different performances of the different seats depending on if it was the male or the female that were in these seats. Some seats are very robust, and others were less robust. KELLY: And in what ways? I'm just trying to understand exactly what you're finding with this new dummy. When you say some were more robust, how so? LINDER: Yeah. When you look at loading to the neck, you would look at how the head moves relative to the torso dynamically. So it's a rear impact where you aim to have the head and the torso as much in line with each other as possible. And that is affected by how the body interact with the seatback. KELLY: Why has this taken so long? LINDER: Yeah, and we're still not there yet (laughter). KELLY: Yeah. LINDER: I think one reason might be that in the regulatory test, it says specifically that you should test with an average male. So even if you would like as a car manufacturer to show what you have done, you cannot. KELLY: So what is the next step? Because it's one thing to have a crash dummy that might tell us more about how a woman's body would respond in a crash. It's another thing for safety regulators to say, OK, we need to have this required for new vehicles. LINDER: Yeah. And I think many new vehicles do provide good safety for both men and women. So the trick here is to actually assess that. So then it would require that it says in the regulation that you should use a model both of an average male and an average female. And today, the regulation tells you that you should use a model of an average male, full stop. KELLY: We have been speaking with Astrid Linder. She's a professor of traffic safety at the Swedish National Road and Transport Research Institute. Astrid Linder, thank you. LINDER: Thank you. KELLY: So interesting. Well, I look forward to continuing to follow your work and what you find. And I'm so glad you're doing it. LINDER: (Laughter). Yes, but thank you for reaching out. And I hope that, you know, these small things all contribute to that we will, yeah, within our lifetime, have an inclusive regulation and not exclusive regulation. KELLY: Amen to that. Thank you very much. LINDER: Thank you. MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:   Here's a fact. Since the 1970s, crash test dummies have been used to test for car safety. And here's another fact.

So where does one influential platform, Twitter, now stand on those concerns? This week, seven civil rights leaders got on a conference call with Twitter's new CEO Elon Musk to try to find out. He is facing increasing pressure as the company has acknowledged a surge in hate speech on the platform. CEO and national director of the Anti-Defamation League Jonathan Greenblatt was on that call with Musk on Tuesday, and he joins me now. Welcome. JONATHAN GREENBLATT: Thank you for having me. SUMMERS: Thanks for being here. So as I understand, Musk was the only Twitter leader on this call. What is the top line on what you all heard from him? GREENBLATT: Well, first of all, just to give you some context, this was members of the Stop Hate for Profit Coalition, a group of civil rights leaders who came together in 2020 after the surge of hate speech, racism and antisemitism on Facebook that was able to ring over a period of months in a series of concessions from the company. We've spoken out about YouTube and Twitter in the past. We came together to meet with Elon Musk to understand his vision for the platform and share some specific concerns. I think the top line on the meeting was, to be honest with you, as always is the case, you know, words matter, but actions matter much more. And yet what we heard was very encouraging. He listened. He processed. And he responded with some very specific commitments that he then tweeted out later that evening, suggesting to us that he plans on following through. SUMMERS: And we should just acknowledge here that most of the world is not on this platform, is not on Twitter. So. . . GREENBLATT: Of course. SUMMERS: Why is it so important to you and the other members of this coalition to get these assurances, to have these conversations with Elon Musk on how the platform is used moving forward? GREENBLATT: Well, look. Already since it was announced he would be buying the platform, we've seen an uptick in extremist activity, racism, antisemitism, homophobia. And we know advertisers share our concerns as well. And so we wanted to express our issues and to hear from him but not just hear, watch him. Will he do it? Putting it in writing on Twitter somewhat binds Elon Musk, I think, to live up to his own words. And he said specific things about not replatforming anyone until there's a clear and transparent process - people who've been kicked off the platform - about maintaining a commitment with information, with infrastructure and resources to enforce election disinformation and maintain the integrity of elections and, finally, to adopt and create a content moderation council, including representatives of groups like ours who have faced hateful violence in the past. SUMMERS: You mentioned replatforming, so I'd like to ask you about one particular user, former President Donald Trump, who was kicked off of Twitter in 2021 shortly after the January 6 attack on the Capitol for tweets that violated Twitter's glorification of violence policy. Did the possibility of allowing Trump back on Twitter come up in your conversation? GREENBLATT: Trump's name was not mentioned. He - actually, I think his name was mentioned. We didn't ask whether he would be replatformed. But Elon did agree not to allow anyone, which would include President Trump, who was deplatformed for violating Twitter rules or inciting violence back on the platform, regardless of their political stature, until there is a transparent process with clear rules and until after the election results are certified. That struck all of us as an important win. SUMMERS: I want to step back here for a moment because, of course, this is not just about Twitter. Misinformation and hate speech is on the rise across our country right now. And you have said, quote, \"a collapse of our democracy is entirely possible if we do not take the necessary steps to prevent it. \" Jonathan, what do those steps look like to you? GREENBLATT: Well, first and foremost, I think social media has been a superspreader of this disinformation hate, to your point, beyond Twitter. We need government intervention, legislative reform, specifically the exemption provided by 230, which has allowed conspiracy theories and incitement and hate to flourish on these platforms. Once and for all, that needs to go away - so Section 230 reform. No. 2, I really think we need to look at some of the bare infrastructure of democracy to make sure that election integrity is maintained, that people have access to the ballot box regardless of their economic class or their social stature. That's incredibly important as well. And No. 3, I think we need other, you know, reforms in Washington. We have a system which is polarized at a level, at the ADL, we have not seen in any point in our memory. After 110 years of fighting hate, I'm afraid we're at a precipice that, if we don't act now, indeed, it could be too late.

From cooling heavy machinery to casting vehicle parts, the process can put a strain on local water systems. And in Germany, the expansion of a Tesla plant that is crucial to the company is now on pause, as officials in the drought-stricken region try to find enough water. NPR's Bobby Allyn reports from Brandenburg, just outside Berlin. BOBBY ALLYN, BYLINE: Deep in the pine woods of eastern Germany is a massive Tesla factory. Its main facility is the size of 130 soccer fields. On a recent rainy day, I'm walking outside of the site's entrance with local resident Heidi Schroeder. She's an activist opposed to the plant's expansion. HEIDI SCHROEDER: It is huge, and it is a middle of forest and the middle of a water protection area in the middle of beautiful landscape. ALLYN: The biggest concern for Schroeder is how much water the Tesla plant is using. The company's contract with the German government says the factory is expected to consume the same amount of water every year as a city of more than 30,000 people. And here's the problem. Brandenburg has, for years, been in the grip of a drought. Wildfires have forced communities to evacuate. Farmers in the area have reported crop failure. SCHROEDER: There's already a lack of water, and Tesla will need a lot of water, also with the extension plans. We do not have this water. ALLYN: The water issue has prompted lawsuits. But when Elon Musk was asked about the Tesla plant depleting local water resources, he was dismissive. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)ELON MUSK: No, no, this is completely wrong. It's like water everywhere here. Does this seem like a desert to you (laughter)? ALLYN: Mention Musk's remarks to Jorg Steinbach, and his eyes widen. Steinbach is the finance minister for Brandenburg and one of the key figures who enticed Tesla to open a plant in Germany. JORG STEINBACH: In terms of the perception in the region, this was not 100% helpful. ALLYN: The water problem has been a huge headache for Steinbach. He says the Tesla site is hoping to triple in size, and it can't do that by relying just on local water. STEINBACH: If you would always use the water which is directly under your feet, you always would run into that problem, whether it will be sufficient for public use as well as industrial use. ALLYN: Experts have said that if Tesla only sourced water locally, the water supply could eventually be depleted for local residents. Steinbach says he is well aware. STEINBACH: That's why we did the exploring. That's why we have drilled new wells, and now we have to install the pipe. ALLYN: New wells, new pipes - a lot of work to keep the factory's expansion going. For now, though, it's on hold. Building out the site in Germany is key to Tesla meeting its global demand for electric cars. It's not just water that's gotten in the way. Activists fighting Tesla on everything from tree preservation to saving sand lizards have delayed his timeline. MATTHIAS SCHMIDT: It's got to a stage with the Tesla facility that these pressure groups are slowing the progress down. It could be a reason Musk recently said that the European plant is a money-burning furnace. ALLYN: That's Matthias Schmidt, a Berlin-based analyst who tracks electric cars in Europe. Right now the factory is making around 2,000 cars a week in Germany. Musk hopes to bring that number up to 5,000, but hurdles keep getting in the way. SCHMIDT: It's probably a bit of a culture shock for Tesla, especially for the boss, the chief executive, Elon Musk. ALLYN: It's a matter of perspective. Musk complains about delays, but German businesspeople talk about the relatively fast clip of the site's development as moving at Tesla speed. Back at his government office, Steinbach notes that in surveys his department has done, the majority of residents in the Brandenburg area support the factory, but on Musk himself, like in America, people are divided. STEINBACH: Fifty percent see the messiah in Elon Musk and Tesla, and for 50%, it's coming from the devil. ALLYN: Messiah or the devil. For local resident Schroeder, the case against the plant's expansion is simple. Just stop now to save the local water supply. As for Musk, well. . . SCHROEDER: Go away with your car. We do not want to have you here. Go to the Mars, for instance. It would be beautiful. ALLYN: Musk, for his part, thinks going to Mars would be beautiful, too. Bobby Allyn, NPR News, Brandenburg.

And reports have been circulating that as many as half of all the people who work for Twitter could be laid off. What does all this turmoil mean for users on the platform? OREMUS: So Elon Musk agreed to buy Twitter for $44 billion at a time when the market for digital advertising was much stronger and the economy in general was stronger. Analysts now think the company is probably worth about half that amount. FADEL: OK. OREMUS: But Musk now has massive debt to pay off. He has to pay off about a billion dollars a year in interest payments, and Twitter's entire revenue last year was around $5 billion. So he's making swift and dramatic cuts across the company as he tries to engineer an overhaul of Twitter's business. FADEL: So he needs these layoffs to make up for that loss. OREMUS: He does. And he also needs new revenue streams, which is why we've seen Musk pushing very hard for the idea of people paying $8 a month to subscribe to something called Twitter Blue, which is going to be a premium version of the service that gives you certain perks like verification, that little blue checkmark next to your name when you tweet on Twitter. FADEL: Which a lot of verified people have been scoffing at online recently. Now, we've seen multiple reports of a class-action lawsuit filed in San Francisco over these layoffs from employees. What do we know about the lawsuit and what other responses there have been from employees at Twitter to these layoffs? OREMUS: The entire situation around the firings and the layoffs has been murky. FADEL: OK. OREMUS: It's clear from our sources that Musk is trying to minimize the amount of severance he has to pay. There are reports that he is trying to fire the top executives for cause, which would deny them the so-called golden parachute payouts of tens of millions of dollars that they were contractually owed. As for the employees, we're hearing that maybe they will be kept on payroll for a while, technically, as part of the - under California law. Details about severance are not clear yet. It's all up in the air, and there will almost certainly be more lawsuits to come. FADEL: Wow, so a lot that's unclear right now. And, you know, when we saw - we just saw that Musk met with civil rights leaders and promised to keep guardrails up through the midterms on Tuesday over hate speech. And that's something that came after an immediate spike in hate speech after Musk acquired the platform. So my question is, could these layoffs affect enforcing those rules, enforcing those guardrails? OREMUS: Absolutely. Musk took over Twitter partly on the premise that he wanted to make it more of a platform for unfettered free speech. . . FADEL: Right. OREMUS: . . . Which sounds great. Everybody loves free speech. In practice, on social media, that tends to mean relaxing rules against things like hate speech, harassment, doxxing people's private information. When - as soon as Musk took over the company, right-wing trolls were thrilled. They started using the N-word, trying to test the boundaries. Now, Twitter's rules have not yet changed. Musk is trying to assure advertisers that the content policies that were in place before will remain in place for the time being. He has said that he will not yet reinstate people who have been banned like Donald Trump. He wants to start a content moderation council to review such decisions. But these cuts will absolutely have an impact on Twitter's ability to enforce those policies that are already on the books. FADEL: Washington Post technology reporter Will Oremus, thank you so much for your reporting. OREMUS: Thanks for having me. LEILA FADEL, HOST:   Employees at Twitter are getting emails today, letting them know whether or not they still have a job.

Staffers found out today whether they still have jobs or not. The layoffs prompted a swift response, a class-action lawsuit from employees - also, calls for advertisers to boycott. NPR's Raquel Maria Dillon joins me. Hey there. RAQUEL MARIA DILLON, BYLINE: Hello. KELLY: Hi. So big picture, why is Elon Musk doing this? - the layoffs, I mean. DILLON: He might be the richest person in the world on paper, but in order to buy this company, he borrowed about $12. 5 billion. He has to pay all that off at the rate of about a billion a year. So dramatically reducing the staff is one way to cut costs, which is what he badly needs. For months, Musk has been complaining that the company is overstaffed, and as soon as he took over, he fired all the executives, dissolved the board of directors. Now he's looking for ways that Twitter can make money, like charging for verified accounts, for example. He says it'll soon cost $8 a month for the coveted blue checkmark. KELLY: Yeah. What has been the reaction to his early moves? DILLON: We should say we don't know exactly how many people lost their jobs or in what departments. A memo went out last night by email telling everyone to stay home today; just check your email to find out your fate. Twitter employees are commiserating on Twitter, of course, expressing gratitude and encouragement and concern about their health insurance. On the other hand, there are a bunch of Twitter users celebrating the fact that these people lost their jobs, calling them government stooges who are afraid of open debate 'cause they disagree with policies put in place by Twitter's previous leadership. Also yesterday, a handful of employees filed a class-action lawsuit accusing the company of failing to give enough notice of the mass layoffs. Under California law, employers have to give at least 60 days' notice. I talked to the lawyer representing these employees today, and she told me the preemptive case might be working 'cause at least some of the staffers got severance pay through January. KELLY: OK. So that's how things are going for Twitter staff. What about for the platform itself? Is it - it's early days, but what do we know about how all this is playing for Twitter? DILLON: Right, just a few days before the midterms. KELLY: Yeah. DILLON: Activists are very worried that there is no one left at Twitter to monitor and block disinformation or dangerous content. They say it opens up the possibility that Twitter could turn into a free-for-all, with false voting information, bad election results. Leaders from those groups also met with Elon Musk this week and said it was a productive conversation. He listened and promised that Twitter would stick with its existing policies. Jessica Gonzalez from Free Press says his actions, though, point in a very different direction. JESSICA GONZALEZ: When you layoff reportedly 50% of your staff, including teams who are in charge of actually tracking, monitoring and enforcing content moderation rules, that necessarily means that content moderation has changed. DILLON: These civil rights groups, critics of Big Tech and media watchdogs are now calling on advertisers to boycott Twitter, warning them that their brands might land next to hateful or harassing content. Musk tweeted today that Twitter has seen a massive drop in revenue and blamed this activist pressure on advertisers. He reiterated that nothing has changed with content moderation. He said, quote, \"we did everything we could to appease the activists. \" And some big brands have already pulled their ads, at least for now. We're talking General Motors, Audi, Pfizer.

We're talking about young people, say, under 40. NPR's Camila Domonoske takes a look at this enthusiasm age gap. CAMILA DOMONOSKE, BYLINE: Let's start with someone who is way under 40. AVI AIRAN: Avi. RAAG AIRAN: And I'm Raag. DOMONOSKE: Meet Avi Airan and his dad, Raag. A few years ago, Raag was driving when Avi, then in preschool, piped up from the backseat. AIRAN: He said, is this a Tesla? And I said, no, it's a Camry. DOMONOSKE: OK, Avi said. But it's electric, right? AIRAN: I said, no, it's a Camry. And it uses gas. DOMONOSKE: If you think that was the end of the conversation, you probably don't know any preschoolers. AIRAN: He kept on asking, like, shouldn't we drive an electric car? Why don't we drive an electric car? DOMONOSKE: OK. This is obviously an extreme example of the generational divide on electric vehicles. But the divide is real. It shows up in poll after poll. People under 40 are more likely to want to go electric. But people over 40 are more likely to actually buy a new car, especially a pricy one like an electric vehicle. Is that a conundrum for the auto industry? Matt Jones with the auto pricing site TrueCar says maybe not. MATT JONES: We're not living only in today. We have to think about what's coming up next. DOMONOSKE: Think about what's coming up in, say, 2035, when California and New York will start requiring all new vehicles to be zero emission. JONES: Because as we get to the time around 2035, these people who, you know, we're calling youngsters now are not necessarily going to be so young. DOMONOSKE: In short, he argues, as automakers are ramping up production, these electric vehicle fans will be growing up into prime car buying age. Meanwhile, data show that interest in electric vehicles is rising and not just among young people. SHELLEY FRANCIS: It's more so just kind of across the spectrum. DOMONOSKE: Shelley Francis runs a consulting group called EVNoire and talks to both automakers and drivers. She says when gas prices went up this summer, she got a lot of questions, like. . . FRANCIS: You guys work in that electric vehicle space. Like, tell me more about how I can save money because these gas prices are killing me. DOMONOSKE: And drivers young and old care about gas prices. There are big challenges as automakers try to take electric vehicles from a few percent of sales to most of the auto market. They need materials. Charging infrastructure is a hurdle. Prices need to come down. But this age gap - it's not a major concern to the industry, as young people get older and older people get more interested in electric vehicles. Consider the Airan family. I asked Avi, who's now 7, what the family drives today. AVI: A Polestar. DOMONOSKE: Polestar. That's a Volvo spinoff, and. . . AVI: It's an electric car. DOMONOSKE: And his grandparents - they now drive a Kia Niro and a Nissan Leaf, both all electric. Camila Domonoske, NPR News.

Who is real and who is fake on Twitter? That is now an urgent question as the new owner of Twitter, Elon Musk, makes the first major change to the social network. He's letting anyone pay for a verified blue checkmark. And since then, chaos has ensued, from fake George W. Bush and Tony Blair accounts trading insensitive jokes about the Iraq war to a, quote-unquote, \"verified\" account for Jesus Christ. Trolls have been having a field day on the platform. And here to tell us more about it is NPR tech reporter Bobby Allyn. Hey, Bobby. BOBBY ALLYN, BYLINE: Hey, Ailsa. CHANG: All right. So what exactly has Musk done with these blue checkmarks? ALLYN: He basically put them up for sale. Now, before Musk, Twitter handed out blue checks to government officials, athletes, celebrities, journalists and others as a way of saying this person or organization is official. And, you know, as a result, what people said from these accounts was taken dead seriously. It could affect people's safety during emergencies. It could influence policy. It would move markets. Now, though, we're in a whole new world because the blue check is shrouded in doubt. And that's, you know, in part because, you know, Musk is offering, for $8 a month, this service called Twitter Blue, which allows you to pay for the status symbol. Musk has tweeted that the old way created, quote, \"lords and peasants\" system. The problem, however, is we've seen, as you mentioned, all sorts of fake accounts - Lebron James' account that was fake, you know, falsely saying he wanted to be traded. There was a phony Nintendo account with, you know, the Mario character giving the middle finger. A Trump impersonator was floating around Twitter. There was a fake Eli Lilly account that falsely said insulin is now free. CHANG: Wow. ALLYN: So, yeah, I mean, Twitter has been nothing short of total chaos the past 24 hours. CHANG: Wait, so what is Musk saying in response to the flood of impersonators? Like, is he going to make any changes? ALLYN: He is. He's instructed employees at Twitter that cracking down on impersonators is the No. 1 priority. And Twitter is suspending some of these phony accounts pretty quickly. But the problem is getting out of hand, I mean, so much so that Twitter announced that Twitter Blue accounts - so, you know, buying these blue checks - it's no longer available for brand new accounts. The company is kind of pausing that right now until it sorts out this mess. CHANG: OK. So in the meantime, like, what are researchers who study social media saying about the blue checkmark changes? ALLYN: Yeah, they're really on edge, Ailsa. I talked to Rachel Tobac. She runs the firm Proof Security, which is focused on preventing the - you know, preventing the abuse of social media sites like Twitter. And, you know, she said we haven't seen any election officials accounts, you know, impersonated yet. But Tobac says we're only in the early days of these changes. RACHEL TOBAC: Right now, we have people making jokes, impersonating the president, impersonating Nintendo. And Elon Musk is laughing at those jokes because he thinks they're funny right now. What's not going to be funny is someone impersonating an election official and meddling and causing interference within the election results. ALLYN: Yeah, Tobac also mentioned that, you know, what if during a hurricane or a flood or some other kind of catastrophe, you know, say, a fake emergency services account with a blue check gave people harmful advice about where to seek shelter? I mean, that could be a total catastrophe. CHANG: Yeah, absolutely. Well, are people thinking, like, all of this is just some growing pain under Musk or is this the new Twitter? ALLYN: Yeah, I think that's the big question right now. I mean, one thing is for sure - more and more of Musk's deputies are ditching him. I mean, just today we learned that Twitter's head of trust and safety is reportedly leaving the company. And that came after news spread that Twitter's chief privacy officer and the top compliance officer resigned over fears that Musk is going to blow off a court order concerning user privacy - so lots of drama inside of the company right now. On the platform itself, you know, Musk has really taken the move-fast-and-break-things ethos of Silicon Valley to heart. A few times already, you know, we've seen these changes announced on Twitter, and they're, you know, then undone just minutes later. So. . . CHANG: Right. ALLYN: . . . It's kind of a crazy time right now. Worth pointing. . . CHANG: Yeah. ALLYN: . . . Out that, you know, these seismic changes are happening at a time when Twitter has half the staff that it had before Musk took over. So if there's one piece of advice I leave you with, Ailsa, it's be careful what you retweet. CHANG: Got you. That is NPR's Bobby Allyn. Thank you, Bobby. ALLYN: Thanks, Ailsa.

CHANG: Wait, so what is Musk saying in response to the flood of impersonators? Like, is he going to make any changes? ALLYN: He is. He's instructed employees at Twitter that cracking down on impersonators is the No. 1 priority. And Twitter is suspending some of these phony accounts pretty quickly. But the problem is getting out of hand, I mean, so much so that Twitter announced that Twitter Blue accounts - so, you know, buying these blue checks - it's no longer available for brand new accounts. The company is kind of pausing that right now until it sorts out this mess. CHANG: OK. So in the meantime, like, what are researchers who study social media saying about the blue checkmark changes? ALLYN: Yeah, they're really on edge, Ailsa. I talked to Rachel Tobac. She runs the firm Proof Security, which is focused on preventing the - you know, preventing the abuse of social media sites like Twitter. And, you know, she said we haven't seen any election officials accounts, you know, impersonated yet. But Tobac says we're only in the early days of these changes. RACHEL TOBAC: Right now, we have people making jokes, impersonating the president, impersonating Nintendo. And Elon Musk is laughing at those jokes because he thinks they're funny right now. What's not going to be funny is someone impersonating an election official and meddling and causing interference within the election results. ALLYN: Yeah, Tobac also mentioned that, you know, what if during a hurricane or a flood or some other kind of catastrophe, you know, say, a fake emergency services account with a blue check gave people harmful advice about where to seek shelter? I mean, that could be a total catastrophe. CHANG: Yeah, absolutely. Well, are people thinking, like, all of this is just some growing pain under Musk or is this the new Twitter? ALLYN: Yeah, I think that's the big question right now. I mean, one thing is for sure - more and more of Musk's deputies are ditching him. I mean, just today we learned that Twitter's head of trust and safety is reportedly leaving the company. And that came after news spread that Twitter's chief privacy officer and the top compliance officer resigned over fears that Musk is going to blow off a court order concerning user privacy - so lots of drama inside of the company right now. On the platform itself, you know, Musk has really taken the move-fast-and-break-things ethos of Silicon Valley to heart. A few times already, you know, we've seen these changes announced on Twitter, and they're, you know, then undone just minutes later. So. . . CHANG: Right. ALLYN: . . . It's kind of a crazy time right now. Worth pointing. . . CHANG: Yeah. ALLYN: . . . Out that, you know, these seismic changes are happening at a time when Twitter has half the staff that it had before Musk took over. So if there's one piece of advice I leave you with, Ailsa, it's be careful what you retweet. CHANG: Got you. That is NPR's Bobby Allyn. Thank you, Bobby.

Within a week of Twitter rolling out its Blue subscription service that allowed users to pay 7. 99 for a verified checkmark, the company announced it's putting the program on pause. It was the first big product launch under Elon Musk at Twitter, and it's been a bust. Fraudsters bought subscriptions so they could impersonate people or brands and cause mischief. NPR's Bobby Allyn - the real one - joins us now. Bobby, thanks so much for being with us. BOBBY ALLYN, BYLINE: Good morning, Scott. SIMON: This announcement yesterday came after somebody took LeBron James' name, somebody took former President Bush's names onto their accounts and got them verified. ALLYN: Yeah. That's right. So as you mentioned - and as a result, Elon Musk is tapping the brakes on Twitter Blue because complete and utter mayhem was unleashed, basically. It turns out if anyone with eight bucks can go and get a blue check on their Twitter profile, well, the internet will be the internet. So, yeah, we saw all kinds of phony accounts. We saw Eli Lilly and Coca-Cola impersonated. We saw - fake accounts of President - former President Trump, Rudy Giuliani, LeBron James sent messages out. Most troubling to people like disinformation researchers, though, were fake accounts that popped up with blue checks purporting to be news organizations. So the situation has clearly gotten very out of hand, Scott. But, you know, Musk's thinking behind this is really twofold here. And it's that he wants Twitter to find ways to make money other than advertising, which is how Twitter makes most of its money. And he thinks blue checks on Twitter is - it's kind of an elitist system, at least according to Musk, right? He thinks, you know, that the power should be given back to the people that believe. That's how he puts it, at least. SIMON: Well, there used to be a system to certify that the people who said they were those people were those people, right? ALLYN: (Laughter) Exactly. So in the before times, I guess we can say now, government agencies, politicians, celebrities, journalists like you and I, Scott, would receive blue checks on Twitter if the company verified and, you know. . . SIMON: Yeah. ALLYN: . . . Did some vetting and did due diligence and figured out, yes, this is the Scott Simon who we think it is. So we'll give this person a blue check, right? But Musk said that amounted to a, quote, \"lords & peasants system. \" So he ripped up the rulebook and decided to start over. As we're discussing here, Musk and his team are now reevaluating. But what remains his strong belief is that, you know, cracking down on bots and scammers on Twitter, you know, really should be the company's No. 1 priority. And he originally thought selling blue checks might be a good solution. Ironically, it has had the opposite effect, and it's made the problem he diagnosed much worse. SIMON: And that's because advertisers and other supporters got upset by how the landscape would change if you had a lot of people doing impersonations? ALLYN: Yeah, in part. I mean, right now you just really can't be confident about anything that you see on Twitter. And as you mentioned, advertisers have gotten - you know, have been very aghast, honestly, looking at the situation and saying, you know, we believe in something called brand safety, and we don't want to place ads next to a bunch of tweets that are spreading disinformation or are impersonating former presidents. That just doesn't sound something that's worth placing an ad next to. SIMON: It would seem as if the richest man in the world is off to a rocky start as head of this platform. What's the outlook? ALLYN: In short, it's pretty bleak, Scott. I mean, look, you have the internet's town square, which is being run right now by an erratic billionaire who likes making decisions rationally. Half of the staff has been laid off. We've already seen a slew of top executive who work on things like trust and safety resign in protest. As you mentioned, big advertisers are bolting. And under the hood, Twitter has never been a very good business, right? It's long struggled to make a profit. And now under Musk, it's got lots of new debt weighing it down. If it's any indication of what could be in store for the company, Musk told employees recently that he's not ruling bankruptcy out. So that's what Twitter is looking at right now.

They feared candidates would falsely claim victory. They feared lies about the election process would go viral online. And they feared possible violence and intimidation as the vote count continued. But so far, none of those fears have been realized - no violence, no false claims of victory. And even conspiracy theories haven't gotten much traction. And to find out why, we're joined now by NPR's Miles Parks and Shannon Bond. Hey to both of you. MILES PARKS, BYLINE: Hey there. SHANNON BOND, BYLINE: Hey, Ailsa. CHANG: OK. So how refreshing is it for there to be a good-news story about the election? Miles, I want to start with you because you spend a lot of time talking to election officials. How good are they feeling about the midterms so far? PARKS: They're feeling great. And specifically, when they look at the landscape of candidate concessions, I think it's really clear. You know, even people like Doug Mastriano, one of the most high-profile election deniers - he was running for governor of Pennsylvania - he conceded his race after he lost. I talked about that with Jocelyn Benson, who's the Democratic secretary of state of Michigan. In her state, there were election deniers running up and down the ballot, including for governor and attorney general. And both those candidates conceded the day after the election. And when that happened, she actually got emotional. JOCELYN BENSON: I got choked up a little bit because to me, that was, like, the affirmation that we did it. We actually ran a smooth election. There were folks who were ready, as we're seeing in other states, to pounce on anything. But it wasn't - it didn't work. PARKS: Now, to be clear, not every candidate has conceded. Even Benson's opponent in the secretary of state race, who lost by more than 600,000 votes, she has not conceded. But the conspiracies that she's been pushing about the election, they haven't stuck in the same way they did in 2020, for instance. CHANG: So interesting. OK. Well, Shannon, you know, these conspiracy theories really haven't taken hold in the days since the election. And I know that you and Miles and Huo Jingnan have been reporting on this. What have you learned about why that is? BOND: Well, I think, you know, we know it's been two years for these conspiracy theories and this general feeling about election fraud to build. But in those past two years, election officials, the media and social networks have also had time to prepare. And I think we've seen some of that payoff. Take Maricopa County in Arizona. It was the focus of some of the most viral fraud claims in 2020. And this time around, there were some issues on Election Day with ballot scanning machines that weren't working. But the county was quick to explain what was happening, to reassure voters their votes would be counted and to push back on right-wing influencers who were trying to claim this was some kind of evidence that Republicans were going to be disenfranchised. And social media researchers we spoke to found overall, these narratives around problems at the polls did not get the same kind of traction that we saw back in 2020. CHANG: So why is that? Like, we heard platforms pledge to make changes after 2020. Did that make a difference? BOND: I mean, make no mistake, Ailsa, there are still a lot of rumors and baseless fraud accusations and conspiracy theories online, and it hasn't gone away. But it's true. Mainstream platforms like Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, TikTok - they've all expanded policies intended to curb the spread of election lies through things like fact checks, labeling. There have been mixed results on how successfully they're enforcing these. But I think the other dynamic here is that the social media landscape has changed. There are these fringe platforms popular with the far right. They've siphoned off some of the more notorious spreaders of these claims. And I think the best example here is former President Donald Trump, right? He was banned from Facebook and Twitter. He doesn't have access to a big megaphone. He had more than 100 million followers on those platforms. These days, he's posting on his own site, Truth Social. Those posts, you know, reach about 4 1/2 million people. They get screenshot and shared to mainstream platforms, but he does not seem to have the same reach as when he was posting directly on Twitter. CHANG: Exactly. Well, Miles, in 2020, I mean, we saw aggressive protesters showing up at vote-counting centers demanding to be let in, sometimes making threats. Like, why are we not seeing that this year? What's your sense? PARKS: I think there are a couple reasons. I mean, one is Trump. Trump was not on the ballot, and he is a very singularly motivating presence for a lot of these people. The other thing that I'm not sure we focused on enough as reporters covering this story is that the election officials, yes, have spent the last two years fighting misinformation, but they've also spent the last two years making new partnerships with law enforcement. And I think that part of this as a deterrence mechanism is something that - I don't know that became clear until this election. You know, one of the videos that has been kind of highest-profile coming out of Maricopa County since voting happened last week was outside of the tabulation center. There were a couple of protesters, but then you saw basically 10 police officers on horseback, also patrolling the counting center. That kind of deterrence seems to have made a big difference here. CHANG: Well, a question for both of you is, you know, given all that has happened or, maybe more importantly, what has not happened in the last week, what do you think? Will election lies continue to be a big problem over the next couple of years before the 2024 presidential election? BOND: Yeah. I mean, I think we need to, first of all, just look at the fact there are races that have not been called yet. I mean, there is still - people are still wary right now about what might happen over the next couple of weeks as we wait for votes to be officially certified. And I also think it's important to recognize that there is a portion of the population on the right that are now - where this has really hardened. You know, they're going into any election expecting fraud. And that does not seem to be going away. And so I think the question for our reporting is, are institutions and the broader voting public resilient enough to keep those kind of factors from eroding democratic systems? PARKS: Yeah, it's definitely too early to claim victory for election officials. I talked recently with Maggie Toulouse Oliver, who is the Democratic secretary of state of New Mexico, and she says she's basically waiting for the other shoe to drop. But she's also acknowledging that, yes, this round seems to have gone really well. MAGGIE TOULOUSE OLIVER: It's been really nice to have a return to what I consider, you know, the norms of our democracy - you know, accepting election results, peaceful transition of power. And it makes me feel hopeful for the first time in quite a while. PARKS: The last few years have been so hard on people who have been running American elections. Right now, they are letting themselves feel a little bit of hope. CHANG: That is good news. That is NPR's Miles Parks and Shannon Bond. Thanks to both of you. PARKS: Thank you. BOND: Thanks for having us. AILSA CHANG, HOST:   Going into last week, a lot of people who run elections were concerned. They feared candidates would falsely claim victory.

But the conspiracies that she's been pushing about the election, they haven't stuck in the same way they did in 2020, for instance. CHANG: So interesting. OK. Well, Shannon, you know, these conspiracy theories really haven't taken hold in the days since the election. And I know that you and Miles and Huo Jingnan have been reporting on this. What have you learned about why that is? BOND: Well, I think, you know, we know it's been two years for these conspiracy theories and this general feeling about election fraud to build. But in those past two years, election officials, the media and social networks have also had time to prepare. And I think we've seen some of that payoff. Take Maricopa County in Arizona. It was the focus of some of the most viral fraud claims in 2020. And this time around, there were some issues on Election Day with ballot scanning machines that weren't working. But the county was quick to explain what was happening, to reassure voters their votes would be counted and to push back on right-wing influencers who were trying to claim this was some kind of evidence that Republicans were going to be disenfranchised. And social media researchers we spoke to found overall, these narratives around problems at the polls did not get the same kind of traction that we saw back in 2020. CHANG: So why is that? Like, we heard platforms pledge to make changes after 2020. Did that make a difference? BOND: I mean, make no mistake, Ailsa, there are still a lot of rumors and baseless fraud accusations and conspiracy theories online, and it hasn't gone away. But it's true. Mainstream platforms like Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, TikTok - they've all expanded policies intended to curb the spread of election lies through things like fact checks, labeling. There have been mixed results on how successfully they're enforcing these. But I think the other dynamic here is that the social media landscape has changed. There are these fringe platforms popular with the far right. They've siphoned off some of the more notorious spreaders of these claims. And I think the best example here is former President Donald Trump, right? He was banned from Facebook and Twitter. He doesn't have access to a big megaphone. He had more than 100 million followers on those platforms. These days, he's posting on his own site, Truth Social. Those posts, you know, reach about 4 1/2 million people. They get screenshot and shared to mainstream platforms, but he does not seem to have the same reach as when he was posting directly on Twitter. CHANG: Exactly. Well, Miles, in 2020, I mean, we saw aggressive protesters showing up at vote-counting centers demanding to be let in, sometimes making threats. Like, why are we not seeing that this year? What's your sense? PARKS: I think there are a couple reasons. I mean, one is Trump. Trump was not on the ballot, and he is a very singularly motivating presence for a lot of these people. The other thing that I'm not sure we focused on enough as reporters covering this story is that the election officials, yes, have spent the last two years fighting misinformation, but they've also spent the last two years making new partnerships with law enforcement. And I think that part of this as a deterrence mechanism is something that - I don't know that became clear until this election. You know, one of the videos that has been kind of highest-profile coming out of Maricopa County since voting happened last week was outside of the tabulation center. There were a couple of protesters, but then you saw basically 10 police officers on horseback, also patrolling the counting center. That kind of deterrence seems to have made a big difference here. CHANG: Well, a question for both of you is, you know, given all that has happened or, maybe more importantly, what has not happened in the last week, what do you think? Will election lies continue to be a big problem over the next couple of years before the 2024 presidential election? BOND: Yeah. I mean, I think we need to, first of all, just look at the fact there are races that have not been called yet. I mean, there is still - people are still wary right now about what might happen over the next couple of weeks as we wait for votes to be officially certified. And I also think it's important to recognize that there is a portion of the population on the right that are now - where this has really hardened. You know, they're going into any election expecting fraud. And that does not seem to be going away. And so I think the question for our reporting is, are institutions and the broader voting public resilient enough to keep those kind of factors from eroding democratic systems? PARKS: Yeah, it's definitely too early to claim victory for election officials. I talked recently with Maggie Toulouse Oliver, who is the Democratic secretary of state of New Mexico, and she says she's basically waiting for the other shoe to drop. But she's also acknowledging that, yes, this round seems to have gone really well. MAGGIE TOULOUSE OLIVER: It's been really nice to have a return to what I consider, you know, the norms of our democracy - you know, accepting election results, peaceful transition of power. And it makes me feel hopeful for the first time in quite a while. PARKS: The last few years have been so hard on people who have been running American elections. Right now, they are letting themselves feel a little bit of hope. CHANG: That is good news. That is NPR's Miles Parks and Shannon Bond. Thanks to both of you. PARKS: Thank you.

There are podcasts that can put you to sleep because they're so boring. But now there's a genre of podcasts and audio streams intended to put you to sleep. Here's what podcast critic Nick Quah has to say about the phenomenon of white noise streams. NICK QUAH, BYLINE: According to some circles, this is the next hot thing in the audio business. (SOUNDBITE OF WHITE NOISE)QUAH: What you're hearing is a white noise stream. You might find variations based on different pitches and frequencies - brown noise, pink noise - but they all have the same form, long recordings of a static droning sound, not unlike the ambient noise you'd hear on a plane flight. White noise streams are a kind of sonic wallpaper, generally having the effect of drowning out the rest of the world. For many, they help keep some parts of the brain distracted so that other parts may better focus on things like writing or studying. As a phenomenon, white noise streams aren't particularly new, but they have recently been rising in prominence on digital platforms like Spotify and YouTube. Earlier this year, Bloomberg reported that some white noise creators were earning up to $18,000 a month on Spotify. The trend has everything to do with the shape of these platforms, which are built around incentives that encourage the mass production of content that's cheap to make and sticky to consume. There is some precedent to the contemporary popularity of these white noise streams. In a sense, they are of a piece with an increasingly vibrant ecosystem of similarly shaped audio content that are native to digital spaces. Consider, for example, stream-of-consciousness podcasts designed to help you fall asleep, like this one, the aptly titled \"Sleep With Me,\" hosted by Drew Ackerman. (SOUNDBITE OF PODCAST, \"SLEEP WITH ME\")DREW ACKERMAN: I guess technically, I'm just wearing shorts and a T-shirt, but it is kind of my pajamas or my, like, pre-bed clothing. But I was also - I guess pre-bed clothing or clothing you sleep in your bed in or clothing you sleep - but I was thinking, like, pajamas is, like, one word, right? But then it got shortened to PJs, which - you know, the S is lowercase for whatever that is, multiple or - I don't know. First of all, isn't it a pajama? Or is the top - because what if you're in a one-piece pajama? QUAH: Consider also YouTube livestreams that string together lo-fi hip-hop tunes, a niche music genre that can arguably be traced back to the beats of J Dilla and the ambient music of Brian Eno. Here's an example of a track from a Danish instrumental producer who goes by Jhove. (SOUNDBITE OF JHOVE'S \"ESCAPE\")QUAH: On the surface, the growing ubiquity of white noise streams has a slightly dystopian feel. They seem to sprout like a fungus, and they quietly creep into spaces they aren't quite meant to be, arriving unexpectedly when you leave YouTube to autoplay indefinitely on its own, or appearing on Spotify charts displaying popular podcast episodes. That's how I first started noticing them, by the way - tucked between an episode of \"The Joe Rogan Experience\" and \"Last Podcast On The Left. \" What's particularly weird about them is how they are meant to sound intentionally generic. While some creators of these streams are affiliated with the traditional music industry, many operate anonymously, presenting themselves as digital avatars. They also feature clumsy, descriptive titles written specifically to game search engines, like \"Deep Layer Brown Noise 12 Hours\" or \"Relaxing Rainstorms White Noise For Sleep. \"If it feels somewhat dystopian, that's because it kind of is. To some extent, these audio streams are creations of profit-seeking actors squeezing as much value as they can from these digital platforms. And as their presence continues to grow, some music industry observers have started raising concerns about how they might crowd out the creations of conventional working musicians. At the same time, there is a pleasure to these audio experiences, and they're also meeting very real needs. Personally, I use white noise streams to sleep when I feel anxious in hotel rooms. It's also hard to shake the sense that the popularity of these audio formats - white noise, sleep podcasts, lo-fi hip-hop and so on - reflects something larger. These streams can be roughly described as works of minimalism. And as the critic Kyle Chayka recently observed, minimalism is a natural reaction to a chaotic moment in history. We do live in chaotic times, so perhaps it's only natural, then, that people are turning to sounds that help drown out everything around them. It's just surreal and maybe a little ironic that the sound of a chaotic world is this. (SOUNDBITE OF WHITE NOISE)GROSS: Nick Quah is podcast critic for New York magazine and Vulture.

FADEL: NPR's Shannon Bond has been trying to sort out the chaos and joins us now. Good morning, Shannon. SHANNON BOND, BYLINE: Hey, Leila. FADEL: OK, so this feels like a question we've been asking a lot, but what in the world is going on inside Twitter? BOND: Well, you know, you'll remember Musk said when he took over just last month, he wanted to shake things up. Now, over half the original staff and thousands of contractors are gone. But, look, Musk overpaid for this company, and he has all this debt to service. So he's under pressure to cut costs, increase revenue. This week, he told remaining workers that they had this choice. Stick around the new hardcore Twitter, work long, intense hours, or they could leave with three months of severance, and they had to decide by Thursday afternoon. And that time rolled around, and it appears a lot of people are choosing door No. 2. They're leaving Twitter. Many of these workers have posted publicly on Twitter under a hashtag, #lovewhereyouworked - it's a play on the company's slogan - and posting a saluting emoji, which has become the symbol of the departures. I should say that Twitter did not respond to questions about the turmoil. Its comms staff has been laid off. FADEL: Well, it appears he's actually shaking things up. So what does this mean, if all these people are leaving, for Twitter's ability to function? BOND: We don't have, you know, hard numbers on exactly how many people are left, but it doesn't look good. It appears the company is losing critical expertise and institutional knowledge about everything from how the site is kept online, protecting user data and privacy and handling toxic and illegal content. Earlier this week, I spoke to a contractor who was laid off last Saturday night with no warning. Her name is Melissa Ingle, and she worked as a data scientist. MELISSA INGLE: I only found out that I was fired by - I happened to be looking at my phone at about 5:30, and I got a little pop-up that said, you've been logged out of one or more systems. BOND: She worked on Twitter's civic integrity team, which works on election policy. And, you know, this is just one area where these layoffs and resignations and firings are worrying people - right? - 'cause Twitter may be a small social network, but it's really influential. You know, politics, sports, business, entertainment, social movements in countries around the world all happened on Twitter. FADEL: Yeah. So what does this mean for users? Are they feeling the effect of all this chaos going on inside Twitter? BOND: Well, people are already acting kind of like it's a funeral, like it's almost, like, a wake for this site that's not dead yet. And also, I think it's really important to note, you know, to keep the platform safe for users, to keep the platform free of misleading content, illegal material, Twitter relies on a lot of people, including thousands of content moderators, who are almost all contractors. And if that workforce is reduced, that could compromise Twitter's ability to curb that content. FADEL: That sounds bad enough business-wise, but are there legal issues as well? BOND: I mean, there are. You know, already U. S. and European regulators are closely watching this. Twitter could face big fines if they don't follow through commitments they've made to protect users. The chaos is already affecting Twitter's business. Big advertisers have halted spending. You know, that's how Twitter makes all its money, basically. And there's also the risk Twitter goes down and that it can't get back online because the people who know how to do that are gone.

And, yes, cookies are also the thing that lets advertisers follow you around the internet to serve you that same gutter protection ad everywhere you go. But the strange thing about the cookie is that when Lou first cooked it up in a internet-lifetime ago, he specifically designed it to protect people's anonymity as they surfed the early web. But that is not how things turned out for the cookie. MONTULLI: No matter your best intentions, technology, once released into the wild, will be used however people choose to use it. You're going to build something, and then, it will evolve over time, and you will have no control over it. And a certain point, you just have to deal with it. (SOUNDBITE OF GEORGE GEORGIA'S \"FRUIT SALAD\")HOROWITZ-GHAZI: Hello, and welcome to PLANET MONEY. I'm Alexi Horowitz-Ghazi. GONZALEZ: And I'm Sarah Gonzalez. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: Nearly 30 years ago, Lou Montulli set out to solve a fundamental problem with the internet and accidentally created an entirely different one. His invention went from an obscure piece of code designed to protect anonymity to an online advertiser's dream to a privacy advocate's nightmare, unleashing a corporate arms race to extract as much of our digital data as possible. GONZALEZ: Today on the show, how the cookie became a monster, why the world's biggest internet browsers have decided to finally let the cookie crumble - to make the cookie disappear from the internet - and what a World Wide Web without cookies might even look like. (SOUNDBITE OF GEORGE GEORGIA'S \"FRUIT SALAD\")HOROWITZ-GHAZI: The story of the cookie begins back in 1994. The World Wide Web was still pretty new. There weren't a ton of websites yet. And like a lot of people, Lou Montulli had the sense that the internet offered the chance to uplift humanity, but only if it was designed in the right way. Lou was 23 at the time, studying computer science. MONTULLI: We were thinking, being naive, young college students, that information would set us all free. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: OK, so the stakes were, like, the future of the free world? MONTULLI: (Laughter) Yes, the future of the free world was at stake. GONZALEZ: Lou dropped out of college to work at a new startup called Netscape. Now, Netscape was setting out to create a new web browser - so, like, you know, Chrome and Safari but before Chrome and Safari existed. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: Back in the early '90s, the internet was still kind of an obscure network, mostly used by academics and hobbyists. Regular people who wanted to casually hop on the internet probably did it through a platform like AOL of \"You've Got Mail. \" It wasn't a browser, but you could access parts of the internet through it. You could read the news, send emails, play games. GONZALEZ: So if the internet was like a giant, open meadow, AOL had put these walls around its own private sections. And if you were an AOL customer, that was your internet world. Netscape - Netscape wanted the Internet to be the whole open meadow, a place where you could wander around freely and go to whatever website you wanted. If AOL wanted to stay within its own little walls, they could do that. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: There were a few smaller browsers already. But Netscape wanted to make a browser that was so smooth and easy to use it would open up the web to millions of people across the world. And they wanted to do it before the giant tech company of the day, Microsoft, got into the game. We should also say Microsoft is a sponsor of NPR. MONTULLI: This isn't a kind analogy, but certainly at Netscape, we thought of ourselves as the Rebel Alliance and Microsoft as the Empire. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: Did you see yourself as more of, like, a Luke Skywalker type? Or were you a Han Solo sort of guy? MONTULLI: (Laughter) God, I wish I could be a Han Solo type of guy. GONZALEZ: I'm definitely a BB-8 kind of guy. I know that. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: I love that for you. GONZALEZ: Lou and his fellow Netscape Rebels, there are, like, a dozen of them at the beginning. They are working like the future of the internet is literally at stake - 14-hour days, not practicing much of what we would now call self-care. MONTULLI: Oh, I had a terrible habit of like, ten, Mountain Dews per day or something like that. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: Oh, my God. MONTULLI: I'm surprised I'm still here (laughter). HOROWITZ-GHAZI: Me, too. I'm glad you survived. GONZALEZ: In order to create a utopian vision of the web, Lou wanted to figure out a way to grow the internet meadow so that it was way bigger than any walled-off version, so that there was, like, so many websites, thousands of companies, an internet too big to be controlled by any one AOL or Microsoft tech giant. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: And Lou knew there was one very effective way to make things grow fast - capitalism. If they could figure out a way to unleash commerce on the internet, the meadow would grow so fast and so wild that nobody would want to stay in their walled gardens anymore. GONZALEZ: Sure, capitalism might not be what you would think the Rebel Alliance would gravitate to. But they were sort of like, we know this is going to get the job done. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: But at the time, you couldn't really do the most basic things that would make the internet appealing to businesses. You could barely shop. And there was one big reason - the web did not have a memory. MONTULLI: So essentially, the web server would completely forget every one of its visitors every single time they connected. GONZALEZ: The web server would forget its visitors. So, like, no one could save anything. You couldn't put stuff you wanted to buy in a shopping cart. The shopping cart did not exist, so online shopping was not really a thing. MONTULLI: You couldn't save anything in a way that allowed you to come back later. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: So, like, grocery stores didn't have their products listed on websites back then. But if they did and you wanted to make a pie and you go to pattispieparts. com (ph) or something like that, you would have to pay for one item at a time. You would have to go to the eggs page, check out, go to the unsalted butter page, check out, go to the peach page, check out again - so inconvenient. GONZALEZ: Lou says there was one obvious solution to the whole the-website-doesn't-remember-you problem. Netscape could just give every web user a unique ID, kind of like a wristband attached to your browser. And every time you went to any website, your browser would, like, show your wristband, and the website would know who you were. It would be one wristband for the whole internet. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: That way, when I popped from the unsalted butter page to the peach page, my web browser would tell Patti's Pie Parts (ph), it's that one guy making a peach pie, he's been here before, every time I appeared. And Patti's Pie Parts could have a shopping cart that would keep track of all the things I wanted. GONZALEZ: OK. But the problem with this wristband-idea approach is that it would make it extremely easy to track everything everyone did on the internet. And Lou, he's a free-and-open internet guy. And to him, you cannot have a free-and-open internet if everyone is being watched. So he thinks, I wonder if I can make a better anonymous wristband. And he remembers this kind of coding tool from a computing class he took in college, something he'd heard called a magic cookie. MONTULLI: I think the cookie term comes from the fortune cookie, where you essentially have a message wrapped in something, that you can't see the message. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: A cookie with a hidden message inside. And Lou thinks we shouldn't have just one identifying wristband for everything you do on the internet; there should be a whole bunch of them, a different wristband for every site you go on. So Patti's Pie Parts could give you a wristband just for them. They could call you Patti's Pie Customer 1234. Nobody else would see it. And that way, an oppressive government or a nosy company couldn't follow your trail across the internet. Lou says actually writing the program to do this was not that complicated. MONTULLI: It was maybe an hour's worth of coding. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: That's, like, two or three Mountain Dews' worth. MONTULLI: (Laughter) Exactly. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: They do, of course, workshop the design for a couple weeks. And Lou decides to drop the magic from the magic cookie's name. MONTULLI: And so I just started calling it cookies right away. Nobody minded the name. It just stuck. GONZALEZ: In 1994, the internet cookie goes out into the world with the launch of the Netscape browser. Baked right into the browser was the cookie. The cookie let you sign in to websites. It let you make comments online. And it solved the shopping cart problem. Netscape's browser was, like, the first really polished browser out there. And when it came out, it blew up. MONTULLI: It's fair to say that it took the world by storm. There were a few million people who were online. And within about five months, I think, 90% of them had switched over to use the Netscape browser. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: Netscape grows superfast. They go public within a year, start hiring hundreds of people. And unsurprisingly, all this hoopla provokes a massive response from their main competitor, Microsoft, which kicks into gear by releasing their own browser, Internet Explorer. And within a few months, they decide to include cookies in their browser, too. Because why wouldn't they? Cookies were a game changer. GONZALEZ: So basically overnight, cookies have gone from barely a twinkle in Lou's eye to this, like, fundamental part of how the internet works. And it's in the midst of this that Lou's cookies get used in a wildly different way from what Lou had imagined by people with a very different goal in mind. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: So did you guys kind of weaponize the cookie? KEVIN O'CONNOR: We say weaponized. I think we were accused, falsely accused, of weaponizing the cookie. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: This is Kevin O'Connor, one of the founders of a company that came to be called DoubleClick. And back in the spring of 1995, Kevin was living in Atlanta, looking to get in on the online gold rush. And his approach to the internet was a bit more practical than utopian. O'CONNOR: And there was a lot of people who didn't want it to be commercialized and wanted it to sort of remain pure. But that's pretty, pretty tough in a free market. So we were trying to figure out, you know, how are people going to make money? HOROWITZ-GHAZI: Kevin and his co-founder, a programmer named Dwight Merriman, eventually settle on advertising. They realized there would be a lot of money to be made if they can become the middlemen connecting advertisers with the growing number of new websites. And they figure out that Lou Montulli's baby, the cookie, would be an essential ingredient to unlocking the potential for advertising on the internet. GONZALEZ: They thought it could be way more targeted than advertising on the radio or on TV 'cause - like, let's say you're a truck company. You sell trucks. O'CONNOR: So I'm looking at, OK, who likes to buy my truck? Let's say it's men, 25 to 40, buy my trucks. OK. Well, where do these men, 25 to 40, go on TV? Well, they go to NFL football. GONZALEZ: So you think, OK, I need to buy an expensive TV time slot ad during an NFL football game. But then, you're basically, like, also paying to advertise to people who are watching the game but will never buy trucks 'cause they hate trucks or because they, like, missed the commercial. So you don't know if you actually reached your target audience. With the cookie, you could. O'CONNOR: I mean, the cookie told us, OK, User 123 saw this Ad A, you know, two times, Ad B four times, on these sites and, you know, responded. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: Here is what's happening behind the scenes. You know how websites had cookies now, little wristbands to keep track of their customers? Well, Kevin and Dwight realize an ad on one of those websites can have its own little wristband, too. Every ad slot that his company, DoubleClick, got on a website gave them the ability to place a specific DoubleClick cookie, or wristband, on your browser. GONZALEZ: So in addition to the main site's wristband that says you are Patti's Pie Parts Customer 1234, you now have one that says you are also DoubleClick Customer 567. That is what let DoubleClick keep track of how many times you saw their particular ad. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: But DoubleClick had a plan to do a lot more with that information. Because as DoubleClick gets more and more websites to let them handle their ad banners at the top of the page, DoubleClick will be able to learn a little bit more about what you're doing online. GONZALEZ: So if you went to, I don't know, like, Teen Vogue and they maybe had a DoubleClick ad slot on their site and then you went to, like, Foreign Policy and then to Modern Farmer. . . HOROWITZ-GHAZI: Oh, yeah. GONZALEZ: . . . And they also maybe had a DoubleClick ad slot, now, DoubleClick knew you were the type of vague, anonymous DoubleClick Customer 567 person who liked teen fashion and farmers and foreign policy. DoubleClick would be able to use that detailed profile of your very specific browsing behavior to charge more from advertisers looking for customers with very specific kinds of tastes. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: This kind of supersophisticated targeting was still years away. But even in the mid-'90s when DoubleClick was first getting started, their ad tracking was a huge success. But for Lou, who'd created the original cookie for Netscape and cared about user privacy on the internet, DoubleClick's model caught him off guard. When did you first hear that cookies were being used in a way that you hadn't originally intended? MONTULLI: I got word of it, I think, through a CNET article. And they found that the advertising network was using cookies to track ads across multiple websites. And that could imply that that ad network could know when a browser had visited multiple sites. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: And how did you feel when you first read that? MONTULLI: I was a little shocked, honestly, 'cause, you know, we had specifically designed this not to be possible. This was a big violation of the spirit of cookies so - felt that we needed to do something about it. GONZALEZ: A violation of the spirit of cookies. Lou goes to his bosses at Netscape. Like, did you know that our cookie is being used like this? And the bosses are kind of like, OK, Lou, figure it out. MONTULLI: It was left to me entirely because nobody else really wanted to deal with it. And, yeah, I wasn't entirely comfortable with having all that power. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: Lou, he is just 25 years old at this point. And to be clear, he did have the power to kill the cookie. Netscape had some 80% of the browser market. So if they decided to disable the cookie, they would basically be pulling the plug on it for the whole internet. So in order to make his decision, he starts digging into how DoubleClick is actually using the cookie. MONTULLI: An important thing that we discovered in the research was that ad tracking enabled significantly more revenue for a site using advertising as their primary revenue source and that if we completely disabled ad tracking that, we would likely kill about 90% of the revenue going to the web at that time. GONZALEZ: It's hard to know exactly how much of the web's revenue this would have actually cut off. But a huge amount of money flowing into the web did come from this ad-tracking model. It was basically funding the internet. And scuttling the cookie would mean blowing up the whole system. MONTULLI: Turning it off would be - you know, would be a heavy, heavy hammer. You won't really be able to come back from that. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: So Lou was facing a kind of devil's bargain. If he didn't do something, he'd be betraying his utopian vision of the internet. On the other hand, if he fully disabled the cookie, he would also risk hobbling the internet just as it was starting to gather speed. GONZALEZ: So Lou decided to split the difference. He decided, from now on, users have to be told, hey, we're attaching some cookies to you. And users would also now have the option to clear all the cookies off their browser whenever they wanted. But the whole, like, cookie-advertisers-can-track-you thing - that stays. MONTULLI: I was quite torn. And I wasn't terribly confident that I'd made the right decision until years later, when I really came to the realization that if advertising is going to exist and there's going to be ad tracking, that having a singular system that allows visibility and user control was the best way to approach it. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: To see that there are cookies and to be able to say no to them - that was the price Lou paid to keep the cookie alive. (SOUNDBITE OF JONATHAN THOMAS MILLER'S \"THE STRIPPER AND THE FROG\")HOROWITZ-GHAZI: But after the break, the cookie might finally meet its baker. (SOUNDBITE OF JONATHAN THOMAS MILLER'S \"THE STRIPPER AND THE FROG\")GONZALEZ: In the years since Lou Montulli made the decision not to kill the cookie and to let advertisers extract our data, that model went on to explode across the internet. A bunch of companies copied DoubleClick's model. Google acquired DoubleClick, and ad tracking became one of their fundamental profit engines. And along the way, the level of targeting that all these companies were able to do got more and more sophisticated. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: They figured out that if you click on an ad for, I don't know, maybe a denim onesie. . . GONZALEZ: Really going out on a limb there, Alexi. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: . . . Yes, a total wild card-example - but then you get distracted or decide not to buy it for whatever reason, it would be a much more effective targeting strategy for them to now bombard you with ads for that onesie. They found you'd be much more likely to buy it, that sales would go up, which meant their technology was worth even more to advertisers. GONZALEZ: I'm not going to lie. I really like that ads follow me around the internet. I think it makes it very easy for me to shop. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: Obviously, for some people, ad tracking can be this useful way of showing the thing you never knew you needed before. But for others, it's meant something a little more sinister. BENNETT CYPHERS: The cookie is kind of the root of all evil in terms of internet tracking. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: Bennett Cyphers works with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, an organization focused on digital civil liberties. He says this cookie overload has been building for years. GONZALEZ: By the 2010s, when you went to open up a website, there were cookies all over that thing. A single pixel, like a pixel in an image - that can have a cookie. The weather widget on the top right - that can have a cookie. The Facebook like button, the little Facebook thumb they used to have next to, like, a BuzzFeed listicle - that thumb like button had a cookie that was sending information back to Facebook even if you didn't click it. CYPHERS: And so then Facebook says, like, good to see you, Bennett. I hope you enjoy the 10 cats who look like Disney princesses. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: Finally, in 2016, lawmakers in Europe were like, enough with all the creepy hidden data harvesting. They passed a new set of laws that pushed back against Big Tech. CYPHERS: The first and only really big milestone in privacy regulation around the world has been GDPR, the General Data Privacy Regulation. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: Gidper (ph). CYPHERS: Gidper, as we say in the biz. GONZALEZ: You know that thing that happens when you now open a new website and it's like, do you want to accept all the cookies on this page? That's because of Gidper. One of the big principles behind this is that web users should be even more clearly informed that they are being tracked and should have to theoretically make clear decisions about what they will allow. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: Not going to lie. I actually just mash that accept all cookies a lot of the time just to get to the website. GONZALEZ: Yeah, I used to. Now I'm, like, a strictly-necessary-cookies-only. . . HOROWITZ-GHAZI: Ooh, good for you. GONZALEZ: . . . Kind of person. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: Anyway, in addition to making cookies more cumbersome to use, these regulations also brought a lot of negative attention to how much tracking is being done using cookies. And eventually, even some of the big tech companies themselves were like, oh, yeah, we hate tracking too, super sketchy. GONZALEZ: In 2017, Apple said its Safari browser would start limiting how advertisers could use cookies to track people. Apple, by the way, is an NPR sponsor. Then in 2020, Apple went even further. CYPHERS: Safari made a big splash when it became the first major browser that by default would block access to third-party cookies in most contexts. So that was a really big deal. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: You may have seen Apple's recent video ad campaign about data privacy, saying basically, we hate tracking; we're on your side. It's a kind of funny one where an iPhone user stumbles across a secret auction where a bunch of companies are bidding for her data. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As character) The next sale is a digital treasure trove - charming Ellie's private data. It's not creepy. It's commerce. Do I hear 600? - 620, 640, 660. (SOUNDBITE OF GAVEL)UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As character) Sold. GONZALEZ: And it wasn't just Apple's Safari that did this. Firefox, the third-largest web browser by users, did the same thing. And in early 2020, the big dog, Google Chrome - two-thirds of everyone who uses browsers uses Google Chrome, and they announced that they too would be largely discontinuing the cookie - not the ones that allow you to comment and fill your shopping cart, just the ad-tracking cookies. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: But just because those cookies may be going away, that does not mean ad tracking will be going with them. Apple still collects customer data with consent through its app store and uses that for targeted ads. And Google has said that it won't discontinue the cookie until it's come up with basically a replacement for it. One of their main proposals has focused on the idea of putting people into buckets based on their behavior instead of profiling them as individual users. So now you might be one of several thousand vegan kite surfers who enjoy slasher flicks instead of DoubleClick User 456. GONZALEZ: And Bennett says some of these proposed cookie replacements might actually be worse in terms of data privacy. Google originally planned to get rid of the cookie in 2022, but after getting a bunch of pushback on their proposals from activists, regulators and other advertisers, Google announced they would be moving back the cookies' execution date to sometime in 2024. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: So for the moment, the cookie lives to track another day, with your consent, of course. And whether or not the cookie does ultimately die, its creator, Lou Montulli, says what's clear is that the model that grew up around it is here to stay. MONTULLI: It's very difficult to see a world where there is no ad tracking at all. And if they're not using cookies, they will find other means to do tracking. So it's just like a shell game, where the ball moved to a different spot. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: In this cookieless world, instead of accepting or rejecting tracking every time you go to a new website, you may be agreeing to hand over your data just by logging in to Google Chrome or using your email to sign in to a website. And Lou thinks those forms of tracking may not be as transparent. So just on the question of legacy, like, nowadays, like, do you think of yourself as the person who allowed the internet to flourish and kind of pay for itself or, you know, the reason a million ads on every website I go to won't let me forget about the time I Googled, like, knee-high sheepskin boots? MONTULLI: Well, see, that's the thing, is you can forget it any time. Just go up to your cookie settings and tell it to forget, and it will forget. So. . . HOROWITZ-GHAZI: That, folks, is news you can use. Should we do this, Sarah? GONZALEZ: All right, let's do this. We're clearin' our cookies - Chrome. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: Going up - Chrome. GONZALEZ: Clear browsing data. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: Clear browsing data. All right, on three, two, one. GONZALEZ: Wait. No, I don't - I'm not - no. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: What? GONZALEZ: I don't want to clear my cookies. Cancel. I like my cookies. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: I already did it. GONZALEZ: Keeping my cookies. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: Sarah.

(SOUNDBITE OF COIN SPINNING) ALEXI HOROWITZ-GHAZI, HOST:   Whenever Lou Montulli goes online, he, just like the rest of us, gets weirdly specific ads. What's the strangest thing that you maybe casually looked up on the internet that seems to follow you everywhere as an ad, no matter what website you go to? LOU MONTULLI: Gutter protection. (LAUGHTER) MONTULLI: You look that up one time, and you just get bombarded. And I actually did buy gutter protection. And they just kept advertising to me for seemingly forever. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: Does any part of you think, like, I kind of did this to myself? MONTULLI: Yeah, I do feel somewhat responsible for the state of the world. SARAH GONZALEZ, HOST:   Lou Montulli is kind of responsible for the state of the world, at least the online world. MONTULLI: I'm the inventor of the internet cookie. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: The internet cookie. GONZALEZ: So, you know when you go to a new site, you usually have to, like, accept the cookies or reject the cookies? Yeah, those are the cookies that Lou made. MONTULLI: People go, oh, you're the reason I have to keep clicking cancel all the time, so. . . (LAUGHTER) HOROWITZ-GHAZI: You may have a vague sense that cookies play some nefarious role in online tracking. But cookies do a lot of things. Cookies allow you to sign in to a website. They're what allows you to comment on stuff online. And, yes, cookies are also the thing that lets advertisers follow you around the internet to serve you that same gutter protection ad everywhere you go.

But that is not how things turned out for the cookie. MONTULLI: No matter your best intentions, technology, once released into the wild, will be used however people choose to use it. You're going to build something, and then, it will evolve over time, and you will have no control over it. And a certain point, you just have to deal with it.

GONZALEZ: I'm definitely a BB-8 kind of guy. I know that. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: I love that for you. GONZALEZ: Lou and his fellow Netscape Rebels, there are, like, a dozen of them at the beginning. They are working like the future of the internet is literally at stake - 14-hour days, not practicing much of what we would now call self-care. MONTULLI: Oh, I had a terrible habit of like, ten, Mountain Dews per day or something like that. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: Oh, my God. MONTULLI: I'm surprised I'm still here (laughter). HOROWITZ-GHAZI: Me, too. I'm glad you survived.

HOROWITZ-GHAZI: But at the time, you couldn't really do the most basic things that would make the internet appealing to businesses. You could barely shop. And there was one big reason - the web did not have a memory. MONTULLI: So essentially, the web server would completely forget every one of its visitors every single time they connected. GONZALEZ: The web server would forget its visitors. So, like, no one could save anything. You couldn't put stuff you wanted to buy in a shopping cart. The shopping cart did not exist, so online shopping was not really a thing. MONTULLI: You couldn't save anything in a way that allowed you to come back later. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: So, like, grocery stores didn't have their products listed on websites back then. But if they did and you wanted to make a pie and you go to pattispieparts. com (ph) or something like that, you would have to pay for one item at a time. You would have to go to the eggs page, check out, go to the unsalted butter page, check out, go to the peach page, check out again - so inconvenient. GONZALEZ: Lou says there was one obvious solution to the whole the-website-doesn't-remember-you problem. Netscape could just give every web user a unique ID, kind of like a wristband attached to your browser. And every time you went to any website, your browser would, like, show your wristband, and the website would know who you were. It would be one wristband for the whole internet. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: That way, when I popped from the unsalted butter page to the peach page, my web browser would tell Patti's Pie Parts (ph), it's that one guy making a peach pie, he's been here before, every time I appeared. And Patti's Pie Parts could have a shopping cart that would keep track of all the things I wanted. GONZALEZ: OK. But the problem with this wristband-idea approach is that it would make it extremely easy to track everything everyone did on the internet. And Lou, he's a free-and-open internet guy. And to him, you cannot have a free-and-open internet if everyone is being watched. So he thinks, I wonder if I can make a better anonymous wristband. And he remembers this kind of coding tool from a computing class he took in college, something he'd heard called a magic cookie. MONTULLI: I think the cookie term comes from the fortune cookie, where you essentially have a message wrapped in something, that you can't see the message. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: A cookie with a hidden message inside. And Lou thinks we shouldn't have just one identifying wristband for everything you do on the internet; there should be a whole bunch of them, a different wristband for every site you go on. So Patti's Pie Parts could give you a wristband just for them. They could call you Patti's Pie Customer 1234. Nobody else would see it. And that way, an oppressive government or a nosy company couldn't follow your trail across the internet. Lou says actually writing the program to do this was not that complicated. MONTULLI: It was maybe an hour's worth of coding. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: That's, like, two or three Mountain Dews' worth. MONTULLI: (Laughter) Exactly. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: They do, of course, workshop the design for a couple weeks. And Lou decides to drop the magic from the magic cookie's name. MONTULLI: And so I just started calling it cookies right away. Nobody minded the name. It just stuck. GONZALEZ: In 1994, the internet cookie goes out into the world with the launch of the Netscape browser. Baked right into the browser was the cookie. The cookie let you sign in to websites. It let you make comments online. And it solved the shopping cart problem. Netscape's browser was, like, the first really polished browser out there. And when it came out, it blew up. MONTULLI: It's fair to say that it took the world by storm. There were a few million people who were online. And within about five months, I think, 90% of them had switched over to use the Netscape browser. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: Netscape grows superfast. They go public within a year, start hiring hundreds of people. And unsurprisingly, all this hoopla provokes a massive response from their main competitor, Microsoft, which kicks into gear by releasing their own browser, Internet Explorer. And within a few months, they decide to include cookies in their browser, too. Because why wouldn't they? Cookies were a game changer. GONZALEZ: So basically overnight, cookies have gone from barely a twinkle in Lou's eye to this, like, fundamental part of how the internet works. And it's in the midst of this that Lou's cookies get used in a wildly different way from what Lou had imagined by people with a very different goal in mind. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: So did you guys kind of weaponize the cookie? KEVIN O'CONNOR: We say weaponized. I think we were accused, falsely accused, of weaponizing the cookie. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: This is Kevin O'Connor, one of the founders of a company that came to be called DoubleClick. And back in the spring of 1995, Kevin was living in Atlanta, looking to get in on the online gold rush. And his approach to the internet was a bit more practical than utopian. O'CONNOR: And there was a lot of people who didn't want it to be commercialized and wanted it to sort of remain pure. But that's pretty, pretty tough in a free market. So we were trying to figure out, you know, how are people going to make money? HOROWITZ-GHAZI: Kevin and his co-founder, a programmer named Dwight Merriman, eventually settle on advertising. They realized there would be a lot of money to be made if they can become the middlemen connecting advertisers with the growing number of new websites. And they figure out that Lou Montulli's baby, the cookie, would be an essential ingredient to unlocking the potential for advertising on the internet. GONZALEZ: They thought it could be way more targeted than advertising on the radio or on TV 'cause - like, let's say you're a truck company. You sell trucks. O'CONNOR: So I'm looking at, OK, who likes to buy my truck? Let's say it's men, 25 to 40, buy my trucks. OK. Well, where do these men, 25 to 40, go on TV? Well, they go to NFL football. GONZALEZ: So you think, OK, I need to buy an expensive TV time slot ad during an NFL football game. But then, you're basically, like, also paying to advertise to people who are watching the game but will never buy trucks 'cause they hate trucks or because they, like, missed the commercial. So you don't know if you actually reached your target audience. With the cookie, you could. O'CONNOR: I mean, the cookie told us, OK, User 123 saw this Ad A, you know, two times, Ad B four times, on these sites and, you know, responded. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: Here is what's happening behind the scenes. You know how websites had cookies now, little wristbands to keep track of their customers? Well, Kevin and Dwight realize an ad on one of those websites can have its own little wristband, too. Every ad slot that his company, DoubleClick, got on a website gave them the ability to place a specific DoubleClick cookie, or wristband, on your browser. GONZALEZ: So in addition to the main site's wristband that says you are Patti's Pie Parts Customer 1234, you now have one that says you are also DoubleClick Customer 567. That is what let DoubleClick keep track of how many times you saw their particular ad. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: But DoubleClick had a plan to do a lot more with that information. Because as DoubleClick gets more and more websites to let them handle their ad banners at the top of the page, DoubleClick will be able to learn a little bit more about what you're doing online. GONZALEZ: So if you went to, I don't know, like, Teen Vogue and they maybe had a DoubleClick ad slot on their site and then you went to, like, Foreign Policy and then to Modern Farmer. . . HOROWITZ-GHAZI: Oh, yeah. GONZALEZ: . . . And they also maybe had a DoubleClick ad slot, now, DoubleClick knew you were the type of vague, anonymous DoubleClick Customer 567 person who liked teen fashion and farmers and foreign policy. DoubleClick would be able to use that detailed profile of your very specific browsing behavior to charge more from advertisers looking for customers with very specific kinds of tastes. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: This kind of supersophisticated targeting was still years away. But even in the mid-'90s when DoubleClick was first getting started, their ad tracking was a huge success. But for Lou, who'd created the original cookie for Netscape and cared about user privacy on the internet, DoubleClick's model caught him off guard. When did you first hear that cookies were being used in a way that you hadn't originally intended? MONTULLI: I got word of it, I think, through a CNET article. And they found that the advertising network was using cookies to track ads across multiple websites. And that could imply that that ad network could know when a browser had visited multiple sites. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: And how did you feel when you first read that? MONTULLI: I was a little shocked, honestly, 'cause, you know, we had specifically designed this not to be possible. This was a big violation of the spirit of cookies so - felt that we needed to do something about it. GONZALEZ: A violation of the spirit of cookies. Lou goes to his bosses at Netscape. Like, did you know that our cookie is being used like this? And the bosses are kind of like, OK, Lou, figure it out. MONTULLI: It was left to me entirely because nobody else really wanted to deal with it. And, yeah, I wasn't entirely comfortable with having all that power. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: Lou, he is just 25 years old at this point. And to be clear, he did have the power to kill the cookie. Netscape had some 80% of the browser market. So if they decided to disable the cookie, they would basically be pulling the plug on it for the whole internet. So in order to make his decision, he starts digging into how DoubleClick is actually using the cookie. MONTULLI: An important thing that we discovered in the research was that ad tracking enabled significantly more revenue for a site using advertising as their primary revenue source and that if we completely disabled ad tracking that, we would likely kill about 90% of the revenue going to the web at that time. GONZALEZ: It's hard to know exactly how much of the web's revenue this would have actually cut off. But a huge amount of money flowing into the web did come from this ad-tracking model. It was basically funding the internet. And scuttling the cookie would mean blowing up the whole system. MONTULLI: Turning it off would be - you know, would be a heavy, heavy hammer. You won't really be able to come back from that. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: So Lou was facing a kind of devil's bargain. If he didn't do something, he'd be betraying his utopian vision of the internet. On the other hand, if he fully disabled the cookie, he would also risk hobbling the internet just as it was starting to gather speed. GONZALEZ: So Lou decided to split the difference. He decided, from now on, users have to be told, hey, we're attaching some cookies to you. And users would also now have the option to clear all the cookies off their browser whenever they wanted. But the whole, like, cookie-advertisers-can-track-you thing - that stays. MONTULLI: I was quite torn. And I wasn't terribly confident that I'd made the right decision until years later, when I really came to the realization that if advertising is going to exist and there's going to be ad tracking, that having a singular system that allows visibility and user control was the best way to approach it. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: To see that there are cookies and to be able to say no to them - that was the price Lou paid to keep the cookie alive. (SOUNDBITE OF JONATHAN THOMAS MILLER'S \"THE STRIPPER AND THE FROG\") HOROWITZ-GHAZI: But after the break, the cookie might finally meet its baker. (SOUNDBITE OF JONATHAN THOMAS MILLER'S \"THE STRIPPER AND THE FROG\") GONZALEZ: In the years since Lou Montulli made the decision not to kill the cookie and to let advertisers extract our data, that model went on to explode across the internet. A bunch of companies copied DoubleClick's model. Google acquired DoubleClick, and ad tracking became one of their fundamental profit engines. And along the way, the level of targeting that all these companies were able to do got more and more sophisticated. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: They figured out that if you click on an ad for, I don't know, maybe a denim onesie. . . GONZALEZ: Really going out on a limb there, Alexi. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: . . . Yes, a total wild card-example - but then you get distracted or decide not to buy it for whatever reason, it would be a much more effective targeting strategy for them to now bombard you with ads for that onesie. They found you'd be much more likely to buy it, that sales would go up, which meant their technology was worth even more to advertisers. GONZALEZ: I'm not going to lie. I really like that ads follow me around the internet. I think it makes it very easy for me to shop. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: Obviously, for some people, ad tracking can be this useful way of showing the thing you never knew you needed before. But for others, it's meant something a little more sinister. BENNETT CYPHERS: The cookie is kind of the root of all evil in terms of internet tracking. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: Bennett Cyphers works with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, an organization focused on digital civil liberties. He says this cookie overload has been building for years. GONZALEZ: By the 2010s, when you went to open up a website, there were cookies all over that thing. A single pixel, like a pixel in an image - that can have a cookie. The weather widget on the top right - that can have a cookie. The Facebook like button, the little Facebook thumb they used to have next to, like, a BuzzFeed listicle - that thumb like button had a cookie that was sending information back to Facebook even if you didn't click it. CYPHERS: And so then Facebook says, like, good to see you, Bennett. I hope you enjoy the 10 cats who look like Disney princesses. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: Finally, in 2016, lawmakers in Europe were like, enough with all the creepy hidden data harvesting. They passed a new set of laws that pushed back against Big Tech. CYPHERS: The first and only really big milestone in privacy regulation around the world has been GDPR, the General Data Privacy Regulation. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: Gidper (ph). CYPHERS: Gidper, as we say in the biz. GONZALEZ: You know that thing that happens when you now open a new website and it's like, do you want to accept all the cookies on this page? That's because of Gidper. One of the big principles behind this is that web users should be even more clearly informed that they are being tracked and should have to theoretically make clear decisions about what they will allow. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: Not going to lie. I actually just mash that accept all cookies a lot of the time just to get to the website. GONZALEZ: Yeah, I used to. Now I'm, like, a strictly-necessary-cookies-only. . . HOROWITZ-GHAZI: Ooh, good for you. GONZALEZ: . . . Kind of person. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: Anyway, in addition to making cookies more cumbersome to use, these regulations also brought a lot of negative attention to how much tracking is being done using cookies. And eventually, even some of the big tech companies themselves were like, oh, yeah, we hate tracking too, super sketchy. GONZALEZ: In 2017, Apple said its Safari browser would start limiting how advertisers could use cookies to track people. Apple, by the way, is an NPR sponsor. Then in 2020, Apple went even further. CYPHERS: Safari made a big splash when it became the first major browser that by default would block access to third-party cookies in most contexts. So that was a really big deal. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: You may have seen Apple's recent video ad campaign about data privacy, saying basically, we hate tracking; we're on your side. It's a kind of funny one where an iPhone user stumbles across a secret auction where a bunch of companies are bidding for her data. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As character) The next sale is a digital treasure trove - charming Ellie's private data. It's not creepy. It's commerce. Do I hear 600? - 620, 640, 660. (SOUNDBITE OF GAVEL) UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As character) Sold. GONZALEZ: And it wasn't just Apple's Safari that did this. Firefox, the third-largest web browser by users, did the same thing. And in early 2020, the big dog, Google Chrome - two-thirds of everyone who uses browsers uses Google Chrome, and they announced that they too would be largely discontinuing the cookie - not the ones that allow you to comment and fill your shopping cart, just the ad-tracking cookies. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: But just because those cookies may be going away, that does not mean ad tracking will be going with them. Apple still collects customer data with consent through its app store and uses that for targeted ads. And Google has said that it won't discontinue the cookie until it's come up with basically a replacement for it. One of their main proposals has focused on the idea of putting people into buckets based on their behavior instead of profiling them as individual users. So now you might be one of several thousand vegan kite surfers who enjoy slasher flicks instead of DoubleClick User 456. GONZALEZ: And Bennett says some of these proposed cookie replacements might actually be worse in terms of data privacy. Google originally planned to get rid of the cookie in 2022, but after getting a bunch of pushback on their proposals from activists, regulators and other advertisers, Google announced they would be moving back the cookies' execution date to sometime in 2024. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: So for the moment, the cookie lives to track another day, with your consent, of course. And whether or not the cookie does ultimately die, its creator, Lou Montulli, says what's clear is that the model that grew up around it is here to stay. MONTULLI: It's very difficult to see a world where there is no ad tracking at all. And if they're not using cookies, they will find other means to do tracking. So it's just like a shell game, where the ball moved to a different spot. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: In this cookieless world, instead of accepting or rejecting tracking every time you go to a new website, you may be agreeing to hand over your data just by logging in to Google Chrome or using your email to sign in to a website. And Lou thinks those forms of tracking may not be as transparent. So just on the question of legacy, like, nowadays, like, do you think of yourself as the person who allowed the internet to flourish and kind of pay for itself or, you know, the reason a million ads on every website I go to won't let me forget about the time I Googled, like, knee-high sheepskin boots? MONTULLI: Well, see, that's the thing, is you can forget it any time. Just go up to your cookie settings and tell it to forget, and it will forget. So. . . HOROWITZ-GHAZI: That, folks, is news you can use. Should we do this, Sarah? GONZALEZ: All right, let's do this. We're clearin' our cookies - Chrome. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: Going up - Chrome. GONZALEZ: Clear browsing data. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: Clear browsing data. All right, on three, two, one. GONZALEZ: Wait. No, I don't - I'm not - no. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: What? GONZALEZ: I don't want to clear my cookies. Cancel. I like my cookies. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: I already did it. GONZALEZ: Keeping my cookies. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: Sarah.

Back in January, a jury convicted Elizabeth Holmes of defrauding investors of hundreds of millions of dollars. She was chief executive of a blood testing company called Theranos. Now she faces substantial prison time. NPR tech reporter Bobby Allyn has been covering this story. Bobby, good morning. BOBBY ALLYN, BYLINE: Good morning. INSKEEP: What was the fraud? ALLYN: Holmes claimed to have revolutionized laboratory science, in particular the way people get blood tested. The problem was that many of Holmes' core claims about her company's technology were either grossly exaggerated or just purely made up. She claimed that her machines could run a thousand different blood tests when, in fact, only about a dozen actually worked. She forged letters from big pharma companies praising the technology to drum up attention and to bring in more investment dollars. She stretched the truth about the use of Theranos technology by the U. S. military. Eventually, Theranos - which we will note here, was once valued at $9 billion, eventually valued at zero. Eventually, it collapsed in scandal when journalists and federal investigators, you know, exposed the truth about the company. INSKEEP: Entirely aside from the money, this was something that people were depending on for their health. ALLYN: Yeah, that's right. So witnesses took the stand who got these blood tests at Walgreens. There was a witness who was a cancer patient who took a blood test that falsely said her cancer came back. There was a pregnant woman who took a blood test and got a result that showed something not to be true about her pregnancy, which was very troubling. But it's important to note that the jury at trial found her guilty only of the investor counts, that, you know, after deliberating for a long time, they thought it's hard to draw a direct line between Elizabeth Holmes and the patients who were harmed. So she was actually only convicted of ripping investors off, not harming patients. INSKEEP: OK. So how much prison time is she facing then for the loss of money? ALLYN: Well, federal prosecutors have argued in their court papers that she deserves 15 years in prison and that she should pay $800 million in restitution to investors and companies that she ripped off. Now, of course, defense lawyers for Holmes say she deserves just home confinement. But if the judge deems prison necessary, that they should give her no more than 18 months behind bars. Now, Holmes submitted some 130 letters to the judge from friends and family, including from Senator Cory Booker, who is a longtime friend of Holmes. In his letter, Booker cited the activist lawyer Bryan Stevenson, quote, that \"each of us is more than the worst thing that we've done. \"Now, Holmes is 38 years old. She is currently pregnant with her second child, something the judge may consider. The lawyers also point out that she's been volunteering as a sexual assault victim counselor. But prosecutors say she's committed one of the most serious white-collar crimes in Silicon Valley history and that she should spend time behind bars, both as punishment for her deeds and also to send a signal to the tech sector. INSKEEP: I'm interested if anybody did receive a message, given that this story is several years old, and this is certainly not the last scandal there's ever been in Silicon Valley. ALLYN: I think it has had some effect. For example, I was once talking to a biotech founder in San Francisco who told me about a so-called Theranos clause his investors required and paperwork basically affirming that all of the lab tests his startup were doing were really, truly accurate. But zooming out and taking the big picture, I think most in Silicon Valley see Elizabeth Holmes and see Thernos as an anomaly, as sort of a one-off and not indicative of how the industry operates. Now, there are many critics of the industry who say that is certainly up for debate. INSKEEP: NPR's Bobby Allyn, always a pleasure talking with you. ALLYN: Thanks, Steve. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:   A one-time star of Silicon Valley is sentenced today in federal court. Back in January, a jury convicted Elizabeth Holmes of defrauding investors of hundreds of millions of dollars. She was chief executive of a blood testing company called Theranos. Now she faces substantial prison time. NPR tech reporter Bobby Allyn has been covering this story. Bobby, good morning. BOBBY ALLYN, BYLINE: Good morning. INSKEEP: What was the fraud? ALLYN: Holmes claimed to have revolutionized laboratory science, in particular the way people get blood tested. The problem was that many of Holmes' core claims about her company's technology were either grossly exaggerated or just purely made up. She claimed that her machines could run a thousand different blood tests when, in fact, only about a dozen actually worked. She forged letters from big pharma companies praising the technology to drum up attention and to bring in more investment dollars. She stretched the truth about the use of Theranos technology by the U. S. military. Eventually, Theranos - which we will note here, was once valued at $9 billion, eventually valued at zero. Eventually, it collapsed in scandal when journalists and federal investigators, you know, exposed the truth about the company. INSKEEP: Entirely aside from the money, this was something that people were depending on for their health. ALLYN: Yeah, that's right. So witnesses took the stand who got these blood tests at Walgreens. There was a witness who was a cancer patient who took a blood test that falsely said her cancer came back. There was a pregnant woman who took a blood test and got a result that showed something not to be true about her pregnancy, which was very troubling. But it's important to note that the jury at trial found her guilty only of the investor counts, that, you know, after deliberating for a long time, they thought it's hard to draw a direct line between Elizabeth Holmes and the patients who were harmed. So she was actually only convicted of ripping investors off, not harming patients. INSKEEP: OK. So how much prison time is she facing then for the loss of money? ALLYN: Well, federal prosecutors have argued in their court papers that she deserves 15 years in prison and that she should pay $800 million in restitution to investors and companies that she ripped off. Now, of course, defense lawyers for Holmes say she deserves just home confinement. But if the judge deems prison necessary, that they should give her no more than 18 months behind bars. Now, Holmes submitted some 130 letters to the judge from friends and family, including from Senator Cory Booker, who is a longtime friend of Holmes. In his letter, Booker cited the activist lawyer Bryan Stevenson, quote, that \"each of us is more than the worst thing that we've done. \" Now, Holmes is 38 years old. She is currently pregnant with her second child, something the judge may consider. The lawyers also point out that she's been volunteering as a sexual assault victim counselor. But prosecutors say she's committed one of the most serious white-collar crimes in Silicon Valley history and that she should spend time behind bars, both as punishment for her deeds and also to send a signal to the tech sector. INSKEEP: I'm interested if anybody did receive a message, given that this story is several years old, and this is certainly not the last scandal there's ever been in Silicon Valley. ALLYN: I think it has had some effect. For example, I was once talking to a biotech founder in San Francisco who told me about a so-called Theranos clause his investors required and paperwork basically affirming that all of the lab tests his startup were doing were really, truly accurate. But zooming out and taking the big picture, I think most in Silicon Valley see Elizabeth Holmes and see Thernos as an anomaly, as sort of a one-off and not indicative of how the industry operates. Now, there are many critics of the industry who say that is certainly up for debate. INSKEEP: NPR's Bobby Allyn, always a pleasure talking with you.

SIMON: Is it still up and functioning? DOMONOSKE: The site is - let me check - yup, it's still there. Tweets are still loading on the timeline. The risk, obviously, is that this could change, basically at any time, right? Elon Musk laid off a bunch of people. It was the first thing he did when he bought Twitter. And then this week there were more mass resignations. So now the question is really, if something breaks at Twitter, do they have the people on staff they need to fix it? And the bigger question here is not just technological. I mean, a social media platform - its true value is who is on it, right? Like, you can still pull up MySpace as a site, but it's not MySpace anymore, like it was back in the day. SIMON: Well, I will take your word for that. I haven't looked at it for a while. But what about Twitter users? - 'cause what amounts to a kind of wake has been going on site. But after all, they need to turn to Twitter to hold the wake. DOMONOSKE: Yeah. It is not a MySpace situation yet, right? In fact, Elon Musk has been gleefully asserting Twitter usage is at all-time highs. All those people logging in to tweet farewell - it's a lot of traffic. There is a question, I think, about whether people are using Twitter in the same way that they used to, right? All this chaos did a number on Twitter's credibility. The ability to buy blue checks, which used to verify that you were who you said you were - that created confusion about which accounts were real. That doesn't matter if you're just there for the memes and the lols (ph). But if you are on Twitter because you care about getting accurate information, that might matter to you a lot. And that sense of trust could be hard to get back. So I don't know. I think it's an open question whether Twitter is going to remain Twitter as it was or become something else. SIMON: Another open question - what is Elon Musk doing and why? DOMONOSKE: Why would someone pay $44 billion for a company, then fire most of the people who made it and release and unrelease features while tweeting crass jokes. . . SIMON: Yeah. . . DOMONOSKE: . . . About it? SIMON: . . . A good way of putting it. DOMONOSKE: That's your question? SIMON: Yeah, sure. DOMONOSKE: I am not in the business of explaining Elon Musk's psychology. But I called up someone who kind of is. ROSS GERBER: I'm the only guy that Elon allows to talk to the media constantly. He should probably be paying me, to be honest. DOMONOSKE: That's Ross Gerber, a longtime Tesla investor. Musk made a lot of money for Tesla fans like him, and he believes in Elon Musk's instincts. That's why he chipped in some money to help Musk buy Twitter. Here's his take on what's happening. GERBER: He has to put himself in horribly difficult situations to thrive, and that's just the way he is. DOMONOSKE: And Tesla, which just a few years ago was in a perpetual crisis, is now actually successful. GERBER: So he's like, I'm happy. Things are going well. I'm having kids with every woman I meet. You know, what could I do to really make my life difficult? Oh, I'll buy a social media company and try to fix it all in an area that I have very little skill set at doing. That'll be wonderfully challenging for me. DOMONOSKE: So there's one theory for you. Elon Musk was too happy, so he bought Twitter to make life more interesting. SIMON: You know, some people just would have bought a puppy. What else could explain this? DOMONOSKE: All right. Other theories include, maybe he has a grand master plan, and this will all end with a revamped, much-improved, super-profitable Twitter. Or maybe he has a secret plan in the other direction. He's trying to destroy Twitter on purpose so he can declare bankruptcy and restructure the giant debt he saddled the company with. And, you know, maybe there's no plan. I really think you can't discount the possibility that what looks like it doesn't make sense, actually, none of it makes sense. SIMON: Well, that's a tweet you can pin.

TERRI SMITH: Proceed with caution if you plan on investing in crypto, for sure. It's not for the faint of heart. KELLY: Smith lives in the Seattle area. She's semi-retired, works part-time as an architect. She had been interested in crypto for a while and got serious in the summer of 2021. She started learning more about it. SMITH: And it was fascinating. I loved it. I loved the technology. KELLY: So she decided to put a chunk of her investment portfolio into cryptocurrencies. She split her money across a number of crypto exchanges. These are sort of like a website, like E-Trade. But instead of stocks and bonds, you buy and sell cryptocurrencies. And a lot of her money ended up on one of the biggest exchanges - one called FTX. SMITH: It was not just the easiest, but it was the fastest. It just was a really convenient platform to use. KELLY: At first, her crypto investments were crushing it. SMITH: I had seen it increase basically 100% in less than six months. It was about five months that my investments doubled. KELLY: But 2022 has been a rough year for cryptocurrencies. Big ones like bitcoin have lost well more than half their value. Others collapsed entirely. But Terri Smith wasn't fazed. She was careful about the currencies she invested in. She was focused on the long term. Then, this month. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)VICKY NGUYEN: A massive meltdown is sinking the cryptocurrency world. FTX, one of the largest crypto exchanges, is now facing extinction. KELLY: The company, recently valued at $32 billion, unraveled in a matter of days and quickly filed for bankruptcy. Terri Smith was out of town when she first got word that FTX had started freezing some accounts. She managed to get some assets out, but she says she may have lost about $30,000 in the implosion. SMITH: I was devastated, really. That's a huge chunk of money for me. KELLY: She says she felt blindsided. SMITH: It feels like someone's stealing your money. I mean, it feels like - yeah, it feels like theft. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)KELLY: CONSIDER THIS - more than a million people may have lost their money in the FTX collapse. Could this meltdown finally tip the scale towards tighter regulation of the cryptocurrency industry? (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)KELLY: From NPR, I'm Mary Louise Kelly. It's Monday, November 21. It's CONSIDER THIS FROM NPR. FTX spent big money to make trading crypto popular - to gain people's trust. You've probably seen the commercials with superstars like Tom Brady and Steph Curry. (SOUNDBITE OF AD)STEPH CURRY: I'm not an expert, and I don't need to be. With FTX, I have everything I need to buy, sell and trade crypto safely. KELLY: The company paid to have its logo on the uniforms of Major League Baseball's umpires, as if to say everything is fair and square here. And the now-former CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried, built a reputation as an honest broker in an industry that was seen as a Wild West, rife with scams. He advocated for greater regulation and transparency. He met with lawmakers. He donated tens of millions to mostly Democratic campaigns - even more toward philanthropic causes. Terri Smith, the Seattle-area investor, said his sterling reputation is part of what made her feel so blindsided. SMITH: He was supposed to be an effective altruist, and the irony is that he ended up - instead of helping the most people he could help, he ended up screwing over the most people. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)KELLY: NPR's Chris Arnold has been talking to people who had their money in FTX. He picks up the story from here. CHRIS ARNOLD, BYLINE: Investing in crypto is inherently risky, but people didn't lose money this time because bitcoin or some other cryptocurrency plunged in value. It was that the FTX trading platform itself imploded - sort of like if you were investing in stocks using, say, E-Trade or Schwab or Fidelity, and the company said, oops, sorry, we're declaring bankruptcy, and you can't withdraw your money. And for Jake Thacker in Portland, Ore. , it's a lot of money. JAKE THACKER: Roughly $70,000 in FTX when it all came crashing down. ARNOLD: Thacker is 40 years old and works in the tech industry. He's traded crypto for a couple of years, and he'd managed to make about $200,000 using trading bots and advice from investing groups. He heard the news that FTX was melting down. He tried logging into his account. THACKER: Went in, looked at some of where my account balances were - didn't seem to be right. Everything was frozen. There was all kinds of error issues. I was definitely in freak-out mode. ARNOLD: He tried messaging and calling FTX - couldn't find out much of anything. THACKER: And I got my lawyer involved, and he was kind of like, I don't really know, Jake. I don't know what's going to happen here. ARNOLD: So what is likely to happen next for all of these investors? CHARLIE GERSTEIN: It ain't looking good. ARNOLD: Charlie Gerstein is an attorney who's filed class-action cases against other cryptocurrency companies. The bankruptcy filings state that FTX could owe money to upwards of a million people, and he says the basic facts are pretty grim. FTX told investors it would keep their assets safe. So if it can't give people their money back, he says it probably broke the law by doing something else with it. GERSTEIN: The company is short $8 billion, and there's only two conceivable categories of explanation for what happened to that $8 billion. The first is they traded it in speculative investments and lost it - in other words, it's gone - or they stole it. ARNOLD: There is also this. Hackers reportedly may have stolen several hundred million dollars of customers' money as well while all this was going on. Moving forward, the bankruptcy court will eventually try to sort out how much money is left and how it gets divvied up among all of these people. FTX said in a statement, quote, \"we are going to conduct this effort with diligence, thoroughness and transparency. \"Meanwhile, the sudden collapse of FTX is having some contagion effects, as people lose faith in other crypto trading platforms. Jake Thacker says the question basically is, if FTX collapsed, who's to say another one won't, too? THACKER: I think that's where - that fear is creeping into the backs of people's minds right now. It's - I could be the best trader. I could get the best returns. Do I trust the system that will allow me to do it? I think is - that's what's rattling through people's brains right now. ARNOLD: So Thacker says he's pulling some of his money off of other platforms as well. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)KELLY: NPR's Chris Arnold. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)KELLY: The current CEO of FTX is a guy named John Jay Ray III. He took over after Sam Bankman-Fried resigned to see the company through bankruptcy. He did the same for Enron in the 2000s after that company's infamous fraudulent accounting scandal, so it's notable that Ray told a bankruptcy court that, in the case of FTX, he had never seen, quote, \"such a complete failure of corporate controls. \" In a filing, he wrote that company funds were used to purchase homes in the Bahamas and other personal items for FTX employees. He said many company records were missing because executives used chat apps that automatically deleted messages. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)KELLY: This sort of mess is exactly why consumer advocates have been calling for years for tighter, clearer regulations of the cryptocurrency industry. Could the spectacular implosion of one of the biggest names in the business spur Congress to take action? NPR's David Gura looked into it. DAVID GURA, BYLINE: Crypto companies have collapsed before. Cryptocurrencies have cratered. And by and large, it's been status quo on Capitol Hill. But according to Republican Senator Pat Toomey, the ranking member of the Senate Banking Committee, this moment feels different. PAT TOOMEY: It's sort of a combination, I think, of the fact that we're deep in a pretty cold crypto winter, and, during this difficult time, we've seen this really unbelievable explosion of this iconic firm. GURA: Yet to be seen is if Washington's reaction will be different. FTX went from being valued at more than $30 billion to filing for bankruptcy last week, and now hundreds of thousands of customers are desperately trying to recover money that may be gone for good. Unlike banks, there is no government backstop in crypto. There's no deposit insurance. The guardrails that are in place are inadequate, says Toomey, whose investment portfolio includes crypto. He argues lawmakers have to give regulators more guidance. TOOMEY: I think the inaction of Congress and the inconsistency and confusion of regulators has contributed to this problem. GURA: The Justice Department is reportedly investigating the company and its now-former CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried. So are the government agencies that oversee digital assets - a familiar alphabet soup of financial regulators. When it comes to crypto and crypto companies, bureaucrats are locked in a turf war over who oversees what. Of course, legislation could put an end to that. During an onstage interview at an industry conference, Rostin Behnam, who regulates the derivatives market, said he has the tools he needs to ensure crypto companies registered with his agency comply with its rules and regulations. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)ROSTIN BEHNAM: And we will use that authority to the full extent of the law. GURA: Charging companies and individuals and levying fines and other penalties. But plenty of crypto companies are not registered with his agency - the CFTC - or with the other big financial regulator, the SEC. Its chair, Gary Gensler, says the door to his office is open, and he encourages the heads of crypto companies to meet with him and his staff to discuss registering. In fact, Bankman-Fried paid him a visit twice in the past. But during an appearance on CNBC just hours before FTX filed for bankruptcy, Gensler indicated he's getting impatient with companies issuing cryptocurrencies, which he says are securities, like stocks. Gensler wants these companies to provide the public with more information - to be more upfront about risks. Essentially, he wants to put in place more investor protections. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)GARY GENSLER: The laws are clear. And - look, the runway is running out. GURA: The White House has encouraged regulators to double down on enforcement under existing laws - rules that pre-date crypto - but more enforcement requires more resources, regulators say. So Gensler is not just asking for additional regulatory clarity - he also wants a bigger budget. So far, Congress' response has been familiar. There have been short statements. The relevant committees say they're calling witnesses to testify. But legislation? Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis, who chairs the Financial Innovation Caucus, addressed FTX's collapse. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)CYNTHIA LUMMIS: You know, it's awful, and, simultaneously, not all that surprising. GURA: Lummis, who owns bitcoin, introduced a bill with Democratic Senator Kirsten Gillibrand in June. They called it the first comprehensive framework for regulating cryptocurrencies and other digital assets. That legislation hasn't made it out of committee, to the Senate floor, for a vote.

GERSTEIN: The company is short $8 billion, and there's only two conceivable categories of explanation for what happened to that $8 billion. The first is they traded it in speculative investments and lost it - in other words, it's gone - or they stole it. ARNOLD: There is also this. Hackers reportedly may have stolen several hundred million dollars of customers' money as well while all this was going on. Moving forward, the bankruptcy court will eventually try to sort out how much money is left and how it gets divvied up among all of these people. FTX said in a statement, quote, \"we are going to conduct this effort with diligence, thoroughness and transparency. \" Meanwhile, the sudden collapse of FTX is having some contagion effects, as people lose faith in other crypto trading platforms. Jake Thacker says the question basically is, if FTX collapsed, who's to say another one won't, too? THACKER: I think that's where - that fear is creeping into the backs of people's minds right now. It's - I could be the best trader. I could get the best returns. Do I trust the system that will allow me to do it? I think is - that's what's rattling through people's brains right now. ARNOLD: So Thacker says he's pulling some of his money off of other platforms as well. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) KELLY: NPR's Chris Arnold. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) KELLY: The current CEO of FTX is a guy named John Jay Ray III. He took over after Sam Bankman-Fried resigned to see the company through bankruptcy. He did the same for Enron in the 2000s after that company's infamous fraudulent accounting scandal, so it's notable that Ray told a bankruptcy court that, in the case of FTX, he had never seen, quote, \"such a complete failure of corporate controls. \" In a filing, he wrote that company funds were used to purchase homes in the Bahamas and other personal items for FTX employees. He said many company records were missing because executives used chat apps that automatically deleted messages. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) KELLY: This sort of mess is exactly why consumer advocates have been calling for years for tighter, clearer regulations of the cryptocurrency industry. Could the spectacular implosion of one of the biggest names in the business spur Congress to take action? NPR's David Gura looked into it. DAVID GURA, BYLINE: Crypto companies have collapsed before. Cryptocurrencies have cratered. And by and large, it's been status quo on Capitol Hill. But according to Republican Senator Pat Toomey, the ranking member of the Senate Banking Committee, this moment feels different. PAT TOOMEY: It's sort of a combination, I think, of the fact that we're deep in a pretty cold crypto winter, and, during this difficult time, we've seen this really unbelievable explosion of this iconic firm. GURA: Yet to be seen is if Washington's reaction will be different. FTX went from being valued at more than $30 billion to filing for bankruptcy last week, and now hundreds of thousands of customers are desperately trying to recover money that may be gone for good. Unlike banks, there is no government backstop in crypto. There's no deposit insurance. The guardrails that are in place are inadequate, says Toomey, whose investment portfolio includes crypto. He argues lawmakers have to give regulators more guidance. TOOMEY: I think the inaction of Congress and the inconsistency and confusion of regulators has contributed to this problem. GURA: The Justice Department is reportedly investigating the company and its now-former CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried. So are the government agencies that oversee digital assets - a familiar alphabet soup of financial regulators. When it comes to crypto and crypto companies, bureaucrats are locked in a turf war over who oversees what. Of course, legislation could put an end to that. During an onstage interview at an industry conference, Rostin Behnam, who regulates the derivatives market, said he has the tools he needs to ensure crypto companies registered with his agency comply with its rules and regulations. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ROSTIN BEHNAM: And we will use that authority to the full extent of the law. GURA: Charging companies and individuals and levying fines and other penalties. But plenty of crypto companies are not registered with his agency - the CFTC - or with the other big financial regulator, the SEC. Its chair, Gary Gensler, says the door to his office is open, and he encourages the heads of crypto companies to meet with him and his staff to discuss registering. In fact, Bankman-Fried paid him a visit twice in the past. But during an appearance on CNBC just hours before FTX filed for bankruptcy, Gensler indicated he's getting impatient with companies issuing cryptocurrencies, which he says are securities, like stocks. Gensler wants these companies to provide the public with more information - to be more upfront about risks. Essentially, he wants to put in place more investor protections. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) GARY GENSLER: The laws are clear. And - look, the runway is running out. GURA: The White House has encouraged regulators to double down on enforcement under existing laws - rules that pre-date crypto - but more enforcement requires more resources, regulators say. So Gensler is not just asking for additional regulatory clarity - he also wants a bigger budget. So far, Congress' response has been familiar. There have been short statements. The relevant committees say they're calling witnesses to testify. But legislation? Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis, who chairs the Financial Innovation Caucus, addressed FTX's collapse. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CYNTHIA LUMMIS: You know, it's awful, and, simultaneously, not all that surprising. GURA: Lummis, who owns bitcoin, introduced a bill with Democratic Senator Kirsten Gillibrand in June. They called it the first comprehensive framework for regulating cryptocurrencies and other digital assets. That legislation hasn't made it out of committee, to the Senate floor, for a vote.

NPR's Matthew Schuerman reports the number of fires caused by faulty or mishandled batteries is also on the rise. MATTHEW SCHUERMAN, BYLINE: Carmen Tiburcio was already at work when she heard there was a fire at her building in the Bronx one August morning. When she got back, the fire was out, but the smell was overwhelming. CARMEN TIBURCIO: Oh, my God. It was awful because it's not something that you're cooking, and it burned down. No. SCHUERMAN: It was the smell of toxic chemicals from an e-bike battery fire officials said exploded while being charged. A 27-year-old delivery worker died in the blaze from smoke inhalation. TIBURCIO: He did not make it. He - you know, his lungs were very bad. SCHUERMAN: It was a familiar scenario for Dan Flynn, the New York Fire Department's chief fire marshal. DANIEL FLYNN: These bikes, when they fail, they fail like a blowtorch. We've seen incidents where they actually have so much power, they're actually blowing walls down in between rooms in apartments. SCHUERMAN: So far this year, six people have died in such incidents in New York. The total number of fires is expected to top 200 by the end of December. That'd be twice as many as last year's total. FLYNN: It's increasing exponentially. SCHUERMAN: E-bike fires have been reported in other cities across the country and the world. Many, if not most, involve batteries used for food delivery that are either damaged or improperly charged. E-bike owners NPR interviewed in New York City say they do take precautions. Rafael Cardanales, who lives on the Lower East Side, makes sure he always uses the right charger. RAFAEL CARDANALES: A lot of guys have four, five, six bikes in their apartment. They swap out chargers for different bikes when it doesn't belong to that bike. These bikes, they have specific chargers for them. You can't just use any charger, you know? SCHUERMAN: Musfiqur Rahman paid $1,100 for two brand-new batteries recently. Used, refurbished batteries are far cheaper but also riskier. MUSFIQUR RAHMAN: As far as I know that this brand never get involved in this kind of incident. SCHUERMAN: These days, instead of working for a single restaurant, most food couriers use apps like DoorDash or Uber Eats to connect with customers. And these workers often don't have any other place to store and recharge their e-bikes except in their apartments. City Council member Gale Brewer hears about that a lot. GALE BREWER: The other residents call and say, oh, goodness, Gale, there's a delivery bike in the elevator. And they're older, lot of the people calling me, and they freak out because they've read about the fires. SCHUERMAN: Brewer has proposed legislation that would ban the sale of used batteries within city limits, even though she knows the price of new batteries is a stretch for many delivery workers. According to one study, they make just $12 an hour. BREWER: And they do, you know, God's work, so to speak, because New Yorkers like to have food delivered. SCHUERMAN: Brewer says the city has to come up with a way to help delivery workers afford trustworthy batteries, so everyone stays safe. Matthew Schuerman, NPR News, New York.

Until recently, the company had a team dedicated to protecting the free speech and privacy rights of users around the world. But Elon Musk has now laid off Twitter's entire human rights team. So where does that leave users outside of the U. S. who've relied on Twitter to organize social and political movements? Alexandra Givens is president and CEO of the Center for Democracy and Technology. Welcome to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. ALEXANDRA GIVENS: Thanks for having me. SHAPIRO: So your organization serves on Twitter's Trust and Safety Council, which is an independent advisory group that engaged with Twitter on human rights. What do you think it means that the entire human rights team at Twitter is suddenly gone? GIVENS: It sends a devastating message about the priorities of Elon Musk and the new leadership going forward. That team was incredibly important for combating hateful speech, incitement to violence, manipulation in conflict zones. And the idea that that does not require staffing anymore, again, is a really dangerous precedent. SHAPIRO: Well, Elon Musk says it's not so much defunding as it is a shift to AI. Is this work that can be done by automation? GIVENS: No, and that's a really important misperception to try and address. Of course, AI plays a very important role in content moderation. The sheer volume means that people do need to rely on tools for it. But the idea that you can do that without very close human supervision is just a fallacy. Think of some of the examples that you can think of, right? So ethnic violence in Ethiopia - that was an area where the Twitter human rights team was very focused. When you look at some of the coded language involved in some of those incitement episodes, you know, there are things like ethnic slurs that, if you do a literal translation to English, the word is musketeer, right? How do you train a tool to know what those particular trigger words will be in a particular area? It's very context specific, and that. . . SHAPIRO: Although, it's interesting that you give the example of languages that AI might not be familiar with because, in many cases, Twitter and other social media platforms were faulted for not having humans who spoke those languages, and so hate speech went unchecked. GIVENS: Yeah. That's absolutely right, and we were one of the groups that would push back on this. So this isn't to say that life was always perfect on the platform before, but they needed to do more - not do less. You need humans that understand the context in these different settings and more resources devoted to this type of work - not less. SHAPIRO: Has Elon Musk talked about where he sees global Twitter usage and human rights in the priorities that he's setting for the company? GIVENS: I have not seen a thoughtful conversation about this at all. You know, he had this meeting that he vaunted a couple weeks ago with civil rights leaders in the United States. And at the time, it was covered as an effort to appease advertisers - to say that he was going to respond to hate speech and harassment on the platform. That's a nice first step. He hasn't really followed up with that since. But if you look at who was in the room for that conversation, hugely important organizations in the United States focused on civil rights - the NAACP was there, Color of Change, Anti-Defamation League - but it was a decidedly U. S. focus. And again, I think that sends a terrible message about how they are thinking about the order of priorities when we know there are so many other human rights concerns around the world. SHAPIRO: When you look at the last decade or so of Twitter's existence, there are these examples we offered of Twitter being used as a platform for organizing and for democracy and for free speech and human rights. There are also a lot of examples of hate speech flourishing on Twitter. When you look at the balance, which do you think has more often been the case? GIVENS: I don't know if you can call it by percentage, but what I will say is that the company was trying. There were important moments where they took a stand to defend the rights of users to spread important messages online and to push back on instances of government repression or authoritarian efforts. One of the examples that I think is useful to point to is in India where the government pressured Twitter significantly to block accounts that criticized the government in power and the company pushed back and ultimately even filed a lawsuit to do so. Now we look at how that team is being staffed. Musk fired 90% of the 200 people in India at Twitter. They now have 12 people staffing Twitter in India. That's a country with over 1. 3 billion people and over a hundred languages being spoken. So even if it wasn't great before, the lack of resources now, I think, again, is devastating. SHAPIRO: There's a lot of speculation about whether Twitter will survive. If it were to disappear, do you see an alternative platform that people around the world are likely to gravitate to for the kinds of organizing that we've been talking about? GIVENS: So we've seen already a big shift in users going over to Mastodon and what is sometimes called the Fediverse. These are different decentralized platforms that can intercommunicate the same way that I can text you no matter which cell phone company you're using. So I think there's an important glimmer of hope there. At the same time, even the people that run many of those services are saying they're overwhelmed by the sudden uptick. They have a lot of learning and growing to do to resource content moderation and all of the concerns that Twitter had in the past. The demand for this isn't going to go away. The power of a centralized place where people can share information with a really wide audience is hugely important for democracy and for expression.

Musk also started a new verification system that he quickly had to pull back after users impersonated celebrities and companies. And according to the watchdog group Media Matters for America, Twitter has lost 50 of its top 100 advertisers since Musk took it over. Now, this all raises serious questions about Twitter's future. And to help us think through all of this is Kara Swisher. She's a tech journalist and host of the \"On With Kara Swisher\" and \"Pivot\" podcast. Kara Swisher, welcome to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. KARA SWISHER: Hi. How are you doing? DEGGANS: Doing great. So you've been pretty tough on Elon Musk on Twitter, especially recently (laughter). SWISHER: Yeah. Yeah. I've been pretty actually not tough on him. Actually, I've been someone who's interviewed him a lot and always defended him in a lot of ways that maybe I shouldn't have. No, I should have. He's amazing in rockets and cars. I was always inspired by a lot of the things he was making, especially compared to other entrepreneurs who are working on, like, dating services and home laundry delivery services. And I always thought aiming for solar or aiming for cars or rockets was really a very difficult thing to do. And he pulled it off very well, created an amazing car, amazing rockets. And so I thought he could be the one to fix Twitter, actually. He had the money, the means. He had the support of Silicon Valley. He's got the technical skills, and he's obviously an avid user of it. And what's happened as he's taken it over - and over the last year or so, I would say, is he's sort of become this massive troll and someone who punches down and who is using the platform in exactly the way that the problem was. DEGGANS: Well, just in case our listeners might not know, I want to go over your greatest hits. . . SWISHER: Sure. DEGGANS: . . . On Twitter with him. You called him your greatest disappointment as a tech reporter. SWISHER: Yeah. DEGGANS: You accused him of turning Twitter into a petty grievance freak show. SWISHER: Yeah. DEGGANS: Is there one thing, one moment or one action, that convinced you that Musk has sort of changed from this innovator that you thought he was to what he's doing now? SWISHER: No, he's still an innovator. Let's just be clear. There's - you know, Thomas Edison was awful if you read any biography of him. You know, there's a lot of innovators and inventors who, personally and in their lives, did all kinds of awful things. We have to keep that in mind. Nobody's perfect. But I think when he started to really turn - the way he fired everybody - now, a lot of people, including myself, had talked for years - I've covered Twitter since it was started. I've talked about it being overstuffed and not being able to keep up with the other social media companies, et cetera. It needed to change rather drastically, but the way he did it was needlessly cruel - the way he fired people, insulted people. That was one sign that was like, that's very strange for the world's richest man to be nickel-and-diming these people on their way out. The second thing is, when he tried to pull out of the deal and made a series of what were essentially fabrications about why he did it, you know, trying to get out of a deal he signed because he paid too much, which is absolutely true. And then I think what really drove me crazy - there's a number of them. But when he posted - this was one of the first acts as CEO - he posted a piece of misinformation about Paul Pelosi that was part of an anti-gay trope, which was just so damaging. He took it down, never apologized for it. It just shows the way of someone who really has no impulse control and is at the helm of a very important communications site. DEGGANS: Yeah. And what's interesting is that many of the things he seems to be doing, even this plan to readmit accounts that were suspended for abusive behavior. . . SWISHER: Yeah. DEGGANS: . . . Overturning Donald Trump's suspension - it seems like those are the kind of things that would repel advertisers just when he needs them. So that leads a lot of people to wonder, is there some sort of method to what he's doing that we just don't see? Or is there some sort of logic that we're not seeing here? SWISHER: We praise wealthy people as if they're smarter than the rest of us, and they're not. Let me just say, I've after many years of covering them, they're just not. You know, I think - it's not just repel advertisers. He's attacked advertisers. It's not like - it's - he called them woke. I've never met an advertiser that wouldn't advertise on Satan Inc. if it sold him a watch. That's my feeling is they would do whatever it takes. And so he's sort of attacked advertisers as woke, which is kind of ridiculous. And the readmittance of Donald Trump - I said he was going to do it. He talked about it at the time. On January 7, he thought it was the wrong decision. I didn't think he wasn't going to. And again, that's his call. But I do think this overall everybody needs to speak at all times without taking account the safety of people is irresponsible. DEGGANS: As a Black person who uses Twitter a lot, I'm worried about the survival of Black Twitter. SWISHER: Sure. DEGGANS: And, you know, just to explain again for people who might not know, that's kind of an informal network of people who talk about Black culture and things from a Black perspective on Twitter and social media. Do you agree with those who worry that Black Twitter might be marginalized or atomized by Musk's plan, especially to bring back these accounts that were abusive in the first place and often attacked people who were central to Black Twitter? SWISHER: Yeah, I do. I think it's not just Black Twitter, which has been incredibly vibrant and one of the most important parts of growth of Twitter, actually. Twitter has not been the greatest business. But some of these communities that have formed around all kinds of issues - and Black Twitter being the most prominent - have been wonderful and really amazing places to connect. I'm not of the thing that it's going to collapse in any one second. I think the issue is if they let everyone get a blue check, whatever - they - he can charge whatever he wants to people; I'm not paying it. But it creates a confusing situation, and it allows you to be attacked easier. And so that could create a situation, certainly. I think that community will move elsewhere and - as it should. But he isn't playing to the strengths. Black Twitter is a strength of Twitter. You know, there's every kind of Twitter, and those are the strength - these communities of people that find each other and share information in a civil way - not necessarily - not disagreeing, by the way. That's perfectly fine. It's how you disagree and how you debate issues. DEGGANS: Yep, exactly. And I've seen you point out, too, you know, people are talking about the First Amendment, all that stuff. These are private organizations, or these are companies. It's not a public square. And I'm just wondering, what recourse does the public have when so many of these important communications tools, like Twitter and Facebook and Google, are privately owned? What can you do when somebody goes off the rails? SWISHER: I'm sorry to say nothing. It's a private company. It's always been a private company. It's just people think it's something else. You can leave. That's really your only choice is you can leave and find a better place where you can conduct yourselves and have great communities. And that's what's going to happen here if people begin to feel unsafe. I don't know. My own usage has dropped rather significantly. I turned off comments. I got so many anti-gay comments in the wake of the shooting in Colorado. . . DEGGANS: Right. SWISHER: . . . Because I put up a this is terrible. I mean, everyone's got their issues, right? And I just turned off the comments, and it's made Twitter - the whole point was listening to people. I don't - I can't listen to people tell me I should be dying 'cause I'm gay. I just can't. I don't want to. It was bad for my mental health. So, you know, that's what's happening for lots of different types of people around Twitter. DEGGANS: Exactly. That's Kara Swisher. She's a tech journalist and host of the \"On With Kara Swisher\" and \"Pivot\" podcast. Kara Swisher, thanks so much for joining us. SWISHER: Thanks so much.

Are you looking at your phone right now? This year, a survey found that respondents checked their phone once every four minutes. Lots of us struggle to put our devices down. The solution, we're told - just leave it. Do a digital detox. Go touch some grass. But NPR's Life Kit team says there's more to balancing your digital life than just logging off. Here's Mayowa Aina with some tips on how to find a good middle ground. MAYOWA AINA, BYLINE: I have a confession. I'm one of those people who sleeps with their phone. Like, I mean, I charge it right next to my head on my pillow. Scrolling until I pass out and starting back up first thing in the morning is draining. And when I think about it, it might explain why my mornings are so chaotic. But they could be like this. SAMMY NICKALLS: OK. Have you ever been to a hotel that, like, is kind of nice, and you get into the sheets, and it just feels so nice to kind of, like, have this time to yourself and just feel very calm? AINA: That's Sammy Nickalls. NICKALLS: That's what I felt when I put my phone outside of my room. It's like I got that presence of mind back because it makes that time around your bedtime feel just like a sanctuary. AINA: Nickalls is the author of \"Log Off: Self-Help For The Extremely Online,\" and it's a workbook to help people begin to practice an approach called digital minimalism. Now, digital minimalism is not to be confused with a digital detox, which is when you just quit the internet cold turkey for a few weeks. NICKALLS: And then what? Like, you go back online, and you don't really have a plan to be able to figure out how to kind of strike that balance in between being completely offline and being too online. Digital minimalism is more about figuring out your own personal internet boundaries. AINA: For Nickalls, cutting out the internet isn't nearly as important or useful as cutting down on using it. Finding that middle ground can help you regain your time and start to feel better mentally, physically and emotionally. The first tip for doing this is setting basic boundaries. You can start by turning off push notifications from apps on your phone so it's not constantly pinging and, yes, charging your phone outside of your bedroom. The next tip is to figure out your scrolling habits. Do you run to Twitter when you feel lonely? Does checking Instagram make you feel insecure? When you're online, ask yourself how you feel and write down the answer so you can reflect on it. NICKALLS: And maybe then that'll lead to why. And what can I do? And most times it's not scroll. Most times it's, like, take a nap or talk to a friend or do something that makes you happy. AINA: And that's the third tip - reinvest in yourself and spending time in your offline hobbies. Nickalls says practicing digital minimalism means you'll probably have a lot more time on your hands. NICKALLS: That's really how it felt, where I was like, oh, my God, I can do anything I want with my time. Like, and I forgot. I forgot that I'm an adult who can do whatever I want, you know? AINA: The goal with digital minimalism isn't to figure out how to live without social media or the internet. It's to be more aware of when and how you use it. Technology should enhance your life, not distract you from it. NICKALLS: The less that I have these pings on my brain of, like, news articles, tweets and that sort of thing, the less that my brain feels like it's just constantly being activated, the more that I realize I just want to sit and relax a little bit and, like, just be. And that itself feels almost revolutionary. AINA: Digital minimalism, Nickalls says, is a step toward living a more intentional life. For NPR News, I'm Mayowa Aina.

The question is whether the city's police department can use robots to kill people. Professor Ryan Calo studies robotics and law at the University of Washington. Welcome back to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. RYAN CALO: Glad to be here. SHAPIRO: The Dallas Police Department used a robot to kill a suspect back in 2016, so this is not unheard of. What kinds of scenarios are we talking about here? CALO: Typically, the way that the police use robots is either to gain situational awareness using a drone in the air or else to investigate a suspicious object that could be a bomb or to negotiate with a suspect in a hostage situation. There's been almost no instances of any violence at all through robots except for Dallas. But there have been multiple instances when people have shot robots. So people in hostage situations have unloaded shotguns on police robots before and shot robots out of the air. And so there is a - the history of violence in robots goes human to robot, and the idea that the robots would be able to fire back is disturbing. SHAPIRO: And so do you think San Francisco having this debate is letting science fiction leach into reality, or is it a helpful setting of rules before we get to a place where people are confronted with a situation there may not be rules for? CALO: I do think that police departments that have robots should have policies in place talking about how the robots can and can't be used. I think that's healthy. Often the way that police shootings are justified or attempted to be justified is by reference to the officer's safety. So the dream with robotics is that if nonlethal force, for example, could incapacitate a suspect without the officer ever feeling threatened, then there would be less reason for police to use force. But in actual fact, it is very difficult to gain enough understanding of a situation from a distance with a robot to know when to use force and when not to. SHAPIRO: So you say it would be good for police departments to have standards to follow. Let's talk about what that standard should be. In San Francisco, the initial policy draft prohibited use of robots to deploy deadly force. Now, the current draft policy says, quote, \"robots will only be used as a deadly force option when risk of loss of life to members of the public or officers are imminent and outweigh any other force option available to SFPD. \" What do you think of that as a standard? CALO: First of all, I think it's good for the police department to set standards in advance. And second, I'm glad to see that the standard is so narrow, that you really have to be out of other options. Still, you worry about whether there'll be any situation where the public would feel comfortable with police using lethal force through a robot. You know, even if we thought that there might be some scenarios where our best option is to incapacitate a suspect through deadly force through a robot, it feels so deeply dehumanizing and militaristic. And so, you know, the very prospect of a robot being able to kill someone could be something that the people of San Francisco won't tolerate, even if, you know, there are some very narrow circumstances where it's sort of the best option from a tactical perspective. SHAPIRO: And then there's also the question of accountability. If there's a scenario where a robot hurts or kills the wrong person, who gets put on trial for that? CALO: Yeah. I mean, it's so interesting the way in which technology, and especially robotics, makes a kind of shell game of responsibility, right? You don't know who is responsible. Is it the officer operating the robot? Is it the people that made the robot? Sometimes it feels like it's the robot itself, right? I mean, if there were an incident where an officer hit someone with their car or shot somebody, we would expect that the very next day, there would be police cars and guns on the streets. They're just equipment. But when a robot is involved in violence, we would expect the whole robotics program to be suspended. Why is that? And it has to do with the fact that robots feel different to us. We associate them with science fiction, and we're deeply uncomfortable with them being armed. And if you couple that with the racialized, often untrusting and uncomfortable policing environment we have today, that's not a good mix, right? I mean, technologies that we don't totally understand or trust in the hands of a police force that is still reckoning with century of racial violence, it's not a comfortable combination. SHAPIRO: That's Ryan Calo. He's a law and information science professor at the University of Washington. Thanks a lot. CALO: Thank you, Ari. MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:  After we taped this conversation, a spokesperson for the San Francisco Police Department wrote us to say, quote, \"no policy can anticipate every conceivable situation or exceptional circumstance which officers may face. The SFPD must be prepared and have the ability to respond proportionately. \" ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:   Lethal robots will be on the agenda tomorrow at a meeting of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. The question is whether the city's police department can use robots to kill people. Professor Ryan Calo studies robotics and law at the University of Washington. Welcome back to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. RYAN CALO: Glad to be here. SHAPIRO: The Dallas Police Department used a robot to kill a suspect back in 2016, so this is not unheard of. What kinds of scenarios are we talking about here? CALO: Typically, the way that the police use robots is either to gain situational awareness using a drone in the air or else to investigate a suspicious object that could be a bomb or to negotiate with a suspect in a hostage situation. There's been almost no instances of any violence at all through robots except for Dallas. But there have been multiple instances when people have shot robots. So people in hostage situations have unloaded shotguns on police robots before and shot robots out of the air. And so there is a - the history of violence in robots goes human to robot, and the idea that the robots would be able to fire back is disturbing. SHAPIRO: And so do you think San Francisco having this debate is letting science fiction leach into reality, or is it a helpful setting of rules before we get to a place where people are confronted with a situation there may not be rules for? CALO: I do think that police departments that have robots should have policies in place talking about how the robots can and can't be used. I think that's healthy. Often the way that police shootings are justified or attempted to be justified is by reference to the officer's safety. So the dream with robotics is that if nonlethal force, for example, could incapacitate a suspect without the officer ever feeling threatened, then there would be less reason for police to use force. But in actual fact, it is very difficult to gain enough understanding of a situation from a distance with a robot to know when to use force and when not to. SHAPIRO: So you say it would be good for police departments to have standards to follow. Let's talk about what that standard should be. In San Francisco, the initial policy draft prohibited use of robots to deploy deadly force. Now, the current draft policy says, quote, \"robots will only be used as a deadly force option when risk of loss of life to members of the public or officers are imminent and outweigh any other force option available to SFPD. \" What do you think of that as a standard? CALO: First of all, I think it's good for the police department to set standards in advance. And second, I'm glad to see that the standard is so narrow, that you really have to be out of other options. Still, you worry about whether there'll be any situation where the public would feel comfortable with police using lethal force through a robot. You know, even if we thought that there might be some scenarios where our best option is to incapacitate a suspect through deadly force through a robot, it feels so deeply dehumanizing and militaristic. And so, you know, the very prospect of a robot being able to kill someone could be something that the people of San Francisco won't tolerate, even if, you know, there are some very narrow circumstances where it's sort of the best option from a tactical perspective. SHAPIRO: And then there's also the question of accountability. If there's a scenario where a robot hurts or kills the wrong person, who gets put on trial for that? CALO: Yeah.

S. national security officials are busy with everything from Russia's war in Ukraine to China's pervasive surveillance state. They also have to worry about threats that technically don't even exist yet, things like quantum computers. NPR's cybersecurity correspondent Jenna McLaughlin has our story. JENNA MCLAUGHLIN, BYLINE: Quantum computing might sound a lot like fantasy. Listen to this ad for the new Marvel Ant-Man movie \"Quantumania. \"(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"ANT-MAN AND THE WASP: QUANTUMANIA\")MICHELLE PFEIFFER: (As Janet Van Dyne) Wait. Wait a minute. You're sending a signal down to the quantum realm. Turn it off now. MCLAUGHLIN: That's not exactly reality. But quantum is starting to become a real industry, and quantum computers could one day do amazing things, like help develop lifesaving drugs or turbocharge artificial intelligence. COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE: I'm not sure I understand. MCLAUGHLIN: But experts worry it's already a threat, specifically to encryption, the digital shell protecting many top secrets. (SOUNDBITE OF AD)UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As character) Nation-state adversaries are harvesting data today, ready to decrypt in tomorrow's quantum-powered world. MCLAUGHLIN: I recently heard that ad at a conference in New York City all about how quantum computing relates to cybersecurity. But before we panic, why don't we try to get to the bottom of what quantum computing actually is? ROBERT SUTOR: Literally, the biggest computer is nature itself. MCLAUGHLIN: Robert Sutor works for the startup ColdQuanta after spending decades at IBM. I thought Robert had the most elegant way of explaining how quantum computers are different from the one on your desk. SUTOR: It's every single electron, every single atom, every single photon of light. Somehow, nature marshals all this and performs extraordinary calculations to make all these processes actually work. MCLAUGHLIN: So instead of ones and zeros, a quantum computer makes use of properties of nature to exist in multiple states at once, for example, in order to solve really complex problems. But to actually harness the computing power of those atoms, you've got to be able to control them and connect them. That's one of the tricky parts. Today's quantum computers are basically small collections of these tiny units called qubits. You can try to picture them like this. ARASH FEREIDOUNI: If you're looking for them, they're more of a - lasers passing through a bunch of mirrors. MCLAUGHLIN: Get that? Real simple stuff. That's Arash Fereidouni from Zurich Instruments, talking on the sidelines of the quantum conference. Most of this sounds and still is highly experimental. The biggest quantum computers still don't have nearly enough qubits to break encryption. Even so, intelligence and national security experts worry it's coming. LAURA THOMAS: So at CIA, I was a case officer, and I ran some of our programs overseas. And it was very important for me to understand the technology landscape. MCLAUGHLIN: Laura Thomas is also with ColdQuanta. At the CIA, she says she became so concerned about the threat of quantum computing, she decided to leave. The government has had its challenges keeping up with the pace of technology. She said she wanted the chance to be on the cutting edge in the private sector. THOMAS: And I went down a very long rabbit hole. I talked to a lot of people. And ultimately, what I discovered beyond the headlines - and certainly, there's a fair amount of hype in the industry as well - but still, I discovered that I think this is coming at us much faster than we realize. MCLAUGHLIN: At its simplest, encryption is just a really hard math problem. If you don't have a key, you can't solve it, even with a supercomputer. It would take forever, literally. And I do mean literally. But a quantum computer could figure it out. In fact, a smart guy named Peter Shor actually wrote an algorithm proving it's possible decades ago. DUSTIN MOODY: It kind of spawned a new field. So academic researchers have been looking at this since the 1990s. MCLAUGHLIN: That's Dustin Moody. As a cryptographer at the National Institute of Standards and Technology, he's one of the people leading efforts to revolutionize encryption. For the last five years or so, he's been working to solicit new algorithms from some of the best and brightest. And they're hopeful. They've got some promising leads. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Quantum computing has the potential to transform everything, from how we create new medicines to how we power artificial intelligence and cybersecurity. MCLAUGHLIN: Meanwhile, the Biden White House has made quantum a priority. The president recently toured an IBM facility in New York. It included a photo-op with a quantum computer. Biden's focus was mostly on jobs. But Moody tells me the administration is also focused on the urgency of the threat. It's committed to transitioning the federal government to new forms of encryption as soon as possible. For some in the national security community, changes can't come soon enough. ANN COX: If you're dealing with secret information that you've picked up from a person in another country, you may need to protect that for the lifetime of that person. You're talking 25, 50, 75 years. MCLAUGHLIN: Dr. Ann Cox is in charge of quantum at the Department of Homeland Security. She understands the urgency. She says people's lives are at stake but also their most sensitive data, from email to health care information. But she also finds a kind of joy in hunting down a threat that technically doesn't even exist. COX: Magic is just science we don't understand yet. MCLAUGHLIN: For now, quantum science still sounds pretty magical. Jenna McLaughlin, NPR News. MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:   U.

Musk is taking on the tech giant as concerns grow that it could remove Twitter from its App Store. That would prove devastating to Twitter's business.

KELLY: Tell me more about what exactly Elon Musk is saying about Apple. ALLYN: Yeah. I mean, we know by now that Musk likes tweeting internal company tidbits, and that is what he did. Musk wrote yesterday that Apple has threatened to withhold Twitter from its App Store, but that Apple won't tell him why. Musk then declared through a meme that he intends to go to war with Apple. He's since deleted that tweet, but the sentiment still stands - right? - that Musk is here antagonizing Apple. And yeah, in this fight, Musk just has everything to lose. KELLY: That's interesting. Why? Why does Apple command so much control over Twitter? ALLYN: Yeah. It's because Twitter is incredibly dependent on people scrolling on their phones. Twitter is mostly a phone experience. And in order to be downloaded in Apple's App Store, there's a long list of rules that have to be followed. There are rules against violent content and about - you know, rules against making threats to people's safety. There's rules against bullying. Pornography is not allowed in the App Store. And remember, the social media app Parler, once popular with Trump supporters, that app, Parler, was, you know, kicked out of the App Store for violating Apple's rules. And that completely kneecapped the app. So this is a hugely consequential fight because there is no one else sort of providing a check on Musk's decisions at Twitter. KELLY: What is Apple saying? Have they confirmed that they are indeed considering kicking Twitter out of the App Store? ALLYN: Not so far. But, you know, Apple is a famously guarded company. And they really, as a matter of policy, never give any hints about their App Store decisions. KELLY: I see. So, Bobby, I'm trying to get my head around how Musk is thinking about a potential App Store ban. What else has he actually said? ALLYN: Yeah. He said if, you know, Twitter was banned by Apple, that he would create his own smartphone. That, of course, generated a lot of headlines. And look; yes, Musk is a successful businessman. He runs Tesla and SpaceX. But he's also known for fanciful ideas that never come to fruition. And at this point, I think it's safe to say that a Musk smartphone can be added to his pipe dream list. But he's also used the battle with Apple as an opportunity to draw attention to something else and that's the 30% commission Apple slaps on apps that required paid subscriptions and purchases made in apps. Musk tweeted, quote, \"did you know Apple puts a secret 30% tax on everything you buy through their App Store? \" Now, let me say, Mary Louise, in tech policy circles, this couldn't be less of a secret. The 30% so-called Apple tax has been hotly debated for many, many years. KELLY: If it has been hotly debated for many years, why is Musk fired up and attacking this 30% tax now? ALLYN: It's because part of his plan for revamping Twitter is finding ways other than advertising to make money. His No. 1 plan so far is a subscription service, being able to pay $8 a month for a blue check. Now, Apple is poised to take about 30% of all those purchases, which, you know, has been the case really forever whenever you buy anything in Apple's App Store. But Musk seems to be just now realizing it. It's important to emphasize here that Musk isn't alone in criticizing the 30% commission. I mean, developers large and small, lawmakers from both parties, regulators, even a federal judge have all called it unfair. But Apple says it's necessary to pay for the staff to keep the company's app review process in place. KELLY: NPR's Bobby Allyn. Thanks. ALLYN: Thanks, Mary Louise.

A MART\u00cdNEZ, HOST:  Even though regulators and law enforcement are investigating him, Bankman-Fried sat down for an interview during a business conference in New York on Wednesday. INSKEEP: Those listening include NPR's David Gura, who joins us now. David, good morning. DAVID GURA, BYLINE: Morning, Steve. INSKEEP: Wow. So you would think that your lawyer would tell you to keep quiet. How did he end up talking last night? GURA: Yeah. So this happened at The New York Times' DealBook Summit, a conference that takes place in this theater on Columbus Circle, with a beautiful, sweeping view of Central Park and the New York City skyline. Executives pay thousands of dollars to be there to see people like Mark Zuckerberg of Meta and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. Bankman-Fried was booked to participate in this conference months before the bankruptcy. He used to do events like this all the time. And going in, everyone was wondering, one, is Sam Bankman-Fried going to appear? And two, why would he? Why would someone who is under investigation in the U. S. and elsewhere do this? And Andrew Ross Sorkin, the journalist who did the interview, asked Bankman-Fried point blank - what are your lawyers telling you right now? (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)ANDREW ROSS SORKIN: Are they suggesting this is a good idea for you to be speaking? (LAUGHTER)SAM BANKMAN-FRIED: No, they are very much not. (LAUGHTER)BANKMAN-FRIED: I - and - I mean, you know, the classic advice - right? - is don't say anything. Recede into a hole. And it's not who I am. GURA: Bankman-Fried claimed he has, quote, \"a duty to explain what happened,\" Steve, and to do everything he can to try and do what's right. INSKEEP: OK. So granting that he is out there talking, what did he have to say to explain himself? GURA: Well, he said there was, quote, \"a massive failure of oversight and risk management at FTX. \" Over and over again, Bankman-Fried admitted to having made mistakes, but this is what he said when he was asked if this was a Ponzi scheme or a manipulation of the system. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BANKMAN-FRIED: I didn't ever try to commit fraud on anyone. I was excited about the prospects of FTX a month ago. I saw it as a thriving, growing business. I was shocked by what happened this month. GURA: And that sums up the image Bankman-Fried projected during this really extraordinary interview that lasted longer than an hour - that he's someone who was overextended, Steve, and maybe oblivious - just seemingly unaware that there were these massive issues with FTX. INSKEEP: OK, so you make this general allegation - I didn't realize how bad things were - but then people are going to want to know the details to see if the details check out. Did he give any new details about what he knew and when he knew it? GURA: Yeah. Bankman-Fried said he was nervous about FTX's financials earlier than he first led on - all the way back on November the 2 - which is surprising because, a few days after that, he was still tweeting statements about the company that were pretty rosy. Bankman-Fried said his anxiety kept building through these massive customer withdrawals - what essentially was a bank run at FTX. And he said, on November the 7 - so five days after Bankman-Fried first felt nervous - he was no longer confident that FTX would be able to get customers their money. INSKEEP: November the 7 was just a few weeks ago, which reminds us how quickly this company has unraveled - in now a matter of days. It might have cost some people millions and other people a little bit more, even, conceivably. So what was his goal in talking about all this? GURA: Bankman-Fried said explicitly he is not reckoning with his own future right now. He's not thinking about criminal charges he could face or where he might end up. But a couple of points I want to make here - first, if someone is accused of orchestrating a massive, complex fraud, it would not be the worst thing to come across as absent-minded and maybe incapable. And the second point is, Bankman-Fried keeps saying he wants to get customers their money back, but he no longer works for FTX, Steve. He relinquished control of it. So not only is Bankman-Fried taking a personal risk talking as much as he is. He's also proving to be a big irritant to FTX's new management, who accused him in a court filing, Steve, of making erratic and misleading public statements. INSKEEP: NPR's David Gura, thanks for listening in. Really appreciate it. GURA: Thanks, Steve. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:   Sam Bankman-Fried's lawyers have told him to keep quiet, but the founder of the cryptocurrency exchange FTX is not. A MART\u00cdNEZ, HOST:   Even though regulators and law enforcement are investigating him, Bankman-Fried sat down for an interview during a business conference in New York on Wednesday. INSKEEP: Those listening include NPR's David Gura, who joins us now. David, good morning. DAVID GURA, BYLINE: Morning, Steve. INSKEEP: Wow. So you would think that your lawyer would tell you to keep quiet. How did he end up talking last night? GURA: Yeah. So this happened at The New York Times' DealBook Summit, a conference that takes place in this theater on Columbus Circle, with a beautiful, sweeping view of Central Park and the New York City skyline. Executives pay thousands of dollars to be there to see people like Mark Zuckerberg of Meta and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. Bankman-Fried was booked to participate in this conference months before the bankruptcy. He used to do events like this all the time. And going in, everyone was wondering, one, is Sam Bankman-Fried going to appear? And two, why would he? Why would someone who is under investigation in the U. S. and elsewhere do this? And Andrew Ross Sorkin, the journalist who did the interview, asked Bankman-Fried point blank - what are your lawyers telling you right now? (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ANDREW ROSS SORKIN: Are they suggesting this is a good idea for you to be speaking? (LAUGHTER) SAM BANKMAN-FRIED: No, they are very much not. (LAUGHTER) BANKMAN-FRIED: I - and - I mean, you know, the classic advice - right? - is don't say anything. Recede into a hole. And it's not who I am. GURA: Bankman-Fried claimed he has, quote, \"a duty to explain what happened,\" Steve, and to do everything he can to try and do what's right. INSKEEP: OK. So granting that he is out there talking, what did he have to say to explain himself? GURA: Well, he said there was, quote, \"a massive failure of oversight and risk management at FTX. \" Over and over again, Bankman-Fried admitted to having made mistakes, but this is what he said when he was asked if this was a Ponzi scheme or a manipulation of the system. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BANKMAN-FRIED: I didn't ever try to commit fraud on anyone. I was excited about the prospects of FTX a month ago. I saw it as a thriving, growing business. I was shocked by what happened this month. GURA: And that sums up the image Bankman-Fried projected during this really extraordinary interview that lasted longer than an hour - that he's someone who was overextended, Steve, and maybe oblivious - just seemingly unaware that there were these massive issues with FTX. INSKEEP: OK, so you make this general allegation - I didn't realize how bad things were - but then people are going to want to know the details to see if the details check out. Did he give any new details about what he knew and when he knew it? GURA: Yeah. Bankman-Fried said he was nervous about FTX's financials earlier than he first led on - all the way back on November the 2 - which is surprising because, a few days after that, he was still tweeting statements about the company that were pretty rosy. Bankman-Fried said his anxiety kept building through these massive customer withdrawals - what essentially was a bank run at FTX. And he said, on November the 7 - so five days after Bankman-Fried first felt nervous - he was no longer confident that FTX would be able to get customers their money. INSKEEP: November the 7 was just a few weeks ago, which reminds us how quickly this company has unraveled - in now a matter of days. It might have cost some people millions and other people a little bit more, even, conceivably. So what was his goal in talking about all this? GURA: Bankman-Fried said explicitly he is not reckoning with his own future right now. He's not thinking about criminal charges he could face or where he might end up.

SHAPIRO: Musk later called that one a misunderstanding. But there was also a warning from the European Union's commissioner for digital policy. He told Musk Twitter would have to do more to protect users from hate speech and misinformation or risk a ban. Even before Musk showed up, moderation was a challenge for Twitter, as it has been for virtually every social media company. It's especially true outside the U.

SHAPIRO: CONSIDER THIS - the man who used to lead the team that was responsible for keeping people on Twitter safe has quit. We'll ask him why. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)SHAPIRO: From NPR, I'm Ari Shapiro. It's Friday, December 2. It's CONSIDER THIS FROM NPR. Yoel Roth has held a leadership role at Twitter through years of crises and upheaval at the company. When Russians interfered in U. S. elections in 2016, he was there. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)YOEL ROTH: So these would be accounts that were pretending to be Americans to try and influence certain parts of the conversation. SHAPIRO: Yoel Roth was there when Twitter made a major decision after the events of January 6, 2021. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"THE SITUATION ROOM WITH WOLF BLITZER\")JIM ACOSTA: The president's Twitter account has been suspended. SHAPIRO: And he was there when Elon Musk took over last month. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)ELON MUSK: There are a lot of really talented people at Twitter that I think can take the company in a lot of interesting, new directions. SHAPIRO: The day after those two men held that Twitter spaces chat with advertisers, Yoel Roth resigned. His title had been head of trust and safety. And now he has agreed to talk to us. Yoel, thank you so much for coming back on All Things Considered. ROTH: Thank you for having me. SHAPIRO: Well, it's been a couple of weeks since you left Twitter, so when you look back over your shoulder and see the company from the outside, what stands out to you most right now? ROTH: Twitter appears to be in a moment of transition. And that seems obvious, perhaps, given there was just a $44 billion corporate transition. SHAPIRO: Right. ROTH: But also the identity and the soul of the company are in transition. If Twitter looks more or less the same as it did, that's not surprising. But I'd also say it's very much still too soon to tell whether we are in the Twitter of the future or what that future even might be. SHAPIRO: Some people instead of the word transition would use implosion or some other destructive term. That's not the term you chose. Why not? ROTH: You know, I think large tech companies like Twitter have a massive amount of inertia. And I think that inertia can be both a force for good and a force for bad. At its worst, inertia can cause companies like Twitter to be too slow to respond to emergent threats and issues. But the flipside of inertia is it also makes it a lot harder for things to immediately collapse. And Twitter is a company with engineering excellence that built a world-class product of policies that were crafted thoughtfully and documented publicly and were enforced rigorously. Those are all things that, even if you want to dismantle them, take some amount of time to change. And I think that's informing what we see from the company today. SHAPIRO: Let's talk about Elon Musk because you were at Twitter for eight years until he arrived, close to eight years. And when he arrived, you not only stuck around at first, you kind of publicly defended some of the choices that he made. And then you abruptly left. Why'd you leave? ROTH: Months before the acquisition of Twitter by Elon Musk, I wrote down a series of red lines and limits. And my goal in doing this was to avoid emotional decision-making in the moments after the acquisition. Some of the limits that I wrote down were pretty obvious in retrospect. They were things like, I won't break the law, or I won't lie publicly on anybody's behalf. But one of the ones that ended up being the most important to me was that I'll stay so long as decisions at Twitter are made in a procedurally just way. What I meant was if the process by which we make decisions at Twitter is based in our policies and our principles, and it takes into account systematic analysis of all of the risks and possible outcomes of those decisions, then I can stay and work towards making those decisions. Ultimately, you can change a policy. You can change a principle. You can choose to reinstate one account or another. But what matters to me ultimately is not the decision but how the decision is made. And for me, I wouldn't want to be a part of undermining it with capricious decision-making. And unfortunately, that's what happened. SHAPIRO: Are you saying that Elon Musk made decisions on an arbitrary and capricious basis without consulting a rulebook? ROTH: That's what we've started to see happen at the company, particularly since my departure. We've seen it with the abrupt reinstatement of a number of accounts on Twitter, including the account of the former president. And we've also seen sort of quick, tweet-length announcements of various rule changes or supposed rule changes. SHAPIRO: What was Elon Musk like to work for in those early days? I mean, you worked closely with him. And it feels like we have these two contrasting images of, on the one hand, the richest man in the world who is the CEO of these major companies and, on the other hand, this person who is acting very impulsively, some would say destructively, capriciously laying people off - more than half the staff at one blow. What was he actually like to work with? ROTH: I was, more than anything else, struck by the fact that he operates a lot like other business executives do, which is if you put good information in front of him and make recommendations and ask him to evaluate the facts of an issue, he does so quite thoughtfully. SHAPIRO: Give us an example. ROTH: A notable example of this is the satirical website The Babylon Bee, which had been restricted on Twitter after violating the company's hateful conduct rules related to misgendering of trans people. And Mr. Musk asked me and the trust and safety team to reinstate the account. He bought the company for $44 billion, and so that decision is eminently within his right. But I asked him a series of questions - whether we were changing our policies about misgendering and whether his intent was to make misgendering permissible under the Twitter rules, whereas previously we banned it. I asked him whether he intended to just make a one-off exception for the account of The Babylon Bee, but not change the underlying policies. He was convinced ultimately that taking that kind of one-off action would undermine Twitter's rules and would create sort of gaps in consistency of enforcement that would make Twitter a less trustworthy place. SHAPIRO: So how do you reconcile that with his later decision to have a user poll about whether to allow Donald Trump back on the platform, which seems like the definition of capricious? ROTH: An old phrase that was a product development mantra at Facebook that I think has been attributed to Mark Zuckerberg is move fast and break things. And I think that mentality can explain a lot of what's happened at Twitter. The company has been criticized for years for being entirely too slow. It seems that in place of that perhaps overly slow culture, Mr. Musk is introducing a culture of moving quickly and unfortunately breaking things as a result. And I think the 24-hour polls to make massive platform governance decisions are an example of something that enables quick decision-making, but I'm not convinced that it enables rigorous decision-making. SHAPIRO: You said that Twitter is in a moment of transition, and I want to talk about what that transition means for users, including outside of the U. S. , where most Twitter users are. I spoke last week with Alexandra Givens of the Center for Democracy and Technology. Her organization serves on Twitter's trust and safety council. And she was really worried about Elon Musk's decision to lay off Twitter's entire human rights team. Here's what she said. ALEXANDRA GIVENS: The company was trying. There were important moments where they took a stand to defend the rights of users to spread important messages online and to push back on instances of government repression or authoritarian efforts. SHAPIRO: So, Yoel, what do you think the future of Twitter for people who advocate for human rights, for people who push back against government oppression is likely to be? ROTH: One of the most important uses of Twitter over the years has been the use of speaking truth to power through the platform, and enabling that use safely requires constant investment by a lot of people. Twitter is known in the industry for being a company that has regularly gone to court to defend the privacy of its users. If you are a human rights activist in a country that is hostile to activism or an embedded journalist or a queer person in a country where that's illegal, your very ability to participate as your true self online is contingent on being able to not share some parts of your true self, not just publicly, but also with a company like Twitter. I truly hope that that practice doesn't go away under Mr. Musk. SHAPIRO: Well, except that people who would do that have, for the most part, been laid off, right? ROTH: And I think that's the real risk. You can't do this work with a skeleton crew. SHAPIRO: And so what does that mean for the human rights advocates, the free speech activists? ROTH: I think people need to very thoughtfully and carefully weigh the costs and benefits of using Twitter, given their personal security situation. And that's a terrifying prospect to have to come to terms with, especially for many people who have spent the better part of a decade building a platform and an audience and a community on Twitter. SHAPIRO: So you left Twitter pretty abruptly. And you did not sign a nondisclosure agreement. Other execs who left in the earlier days did sign NDAs. And I'm curious. If those people could talk, what do you think they'd be saying right now? ROTH: One of the defining traits of Twitter was a culture of care and of empathy. And many of the people I spoke with were personally and professionally heartbroken about the fact that that culture might be going away. Above all else, I think the people who choose to work at Twitter generally didn't choose to work at the company because it was the easiest job or the best-paid job. They chose to work there because they believed in the impact that Twitter could have in the world. Twitter is one of the most consequential communication platforms in existence. And what happens on Twitter can move markets, can change elections, and it can impact the safety of millions of people around the world. And more than anything else, people are worried about what will happen, given Twitter's importance in the world, if there isn't a team left to do that type of work. SHAPIRO: You describe your former colleagues as being heartbroken. And you very dispassionately kind of described what the consequences might be of this transition that Twitter is in. As dispassionate as you are in describing this, is it tough for you to watch what's happening right now? ROTH: It is. I'm heartbroken and devastated by what I see happening at the company and what I see happening to decades of investment by professionals into building the service into what it is. But I think we need to have two parallel conversations. We can be upset and concerned about what's happening at Twitter specifically, but we would be remiss if we only had that conversation. We should think about what the trade-offs here are trying to strike a balance between three factors that are often in enormous tension with each other, and those are safety, speech and privacy. And the work of trying to find the right equilibrium there is difficult, if not completely impossible, and yet you still have to do it. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)SHAPIRO: That's Yoel Roth.

SHAPIRO: Yoel Roth was there when Twitter made a major decision after the events of January 6, 2021. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"THE SITUATION ROOM WITH WOLF BLITZER\") JIM ACOSTA: The president's Twitter account has been suspended. SHAPIRO: And he was there when Elon Musk took over last month. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ELON MUSK: There are a lot of really talented people at Twitter that I think can take the company in a lot of interesting, new directions. SHAPIRO: The day after those two men held that Twitter spaces chat with advertisers, Yoel Roth resigned. His title had been head of trust and safety. And now he has agreed to talk to us. Yoel, thank you so much for coming back on All Things Considered. ROTH: Thank you for having me. SHAPIRO: Well, it's been a couple of weeks since you left Twitter, so when you look back over your shoulder and see the company from the outside, what stands out to you most right now? ROTH: Twitter appears to be in a moment of transition. And that seems obvious, perhaps, given there was just a $44 billion corporate transition. SHAPIRO: Right. ROTH: But also the identity and the soul of the company are in transition. If Twitter looks more or less the same as it did, that's not surprising. But I'd also say it's very much still too soon to tell whether we are in the Twitter of the future or what that future even might be. SHAPIRO: Some people instead of the word transition would use implosion or some other destructive term. That's not the term you chose. Why not? ROTH: You know, I think large tech companies like Twitter have a massive amount of inertia. And I think that inertia can be both a force for good and a force for bad. At its worst, inertia can cause companies like Twitter to be too slow to respond to emergent threats and issues. But the flipside of inertia is it also makes it a lot harder for things to immediately collapse. And Twitter is a company with engineering excellence that built a world-class product of policies that were crafted thoughtfully and documented publicly and were enforced rigorously. Those are all things that, even if you want to dismantle them, take some amount of time to change. And I think that's informing what we see from the company today. SHAPIRO: Let's talk about Elon Musk because you were at Twitter for eight years until he arrived, close to eight years. And when he arrived, you not only stuck around at first, you kind of publicly defended some of the choices that he made. And then you abruptly left. Why'd you leave? ROTH: Months before the acquisition of Twitter by Elon Musk, I wrote down a series of red lines and limits. And my goal in doing this was to avoid emotional decision-making in the moments after the acquisition. Some of the limits that I wrote down were pretty obvious in retrospect. They were things like, I won't break the law, or I won't lie publicly on anybody's behalf. But one of the ones that ended up being the most important to me was that I'll stay so long as decisions at Twitter are made in a procedurally just way. What I meant was if the process by which we make decisions at Twitter is based in our policies and our principles, and it takes into account systematic analysis of all of the risks and possible outcomes of those decisions, then I can stay and work towards making those decisions. Ultimately, you can change a policy. You can change a principle. You can choose to reinstate one account or another. But what matters to me ultimately is not the decision but how the decision is made. And for me, I wouldn't want to be a part of undermining it with capricious decision-making. And unfortunately, that's what happened. SHAPIRO: Are you saying that Elon Musk made decisions on an arbitrary and capricious basis without consulting a rulebook? ROTH: That's what we've started to see happen at the company, particularly since my departure. We've seen it with the abrupt reinstatement of a number of accounts on Twitter, including the account of the former president. And we've also seen sort of quick, tweet-length announcements of various rule changes or supposed rule changes. SHAPIRO: What was Elon Musk like to work for in those early days? I mean, you worked closely with him. And it feels like we have these two contrasting images of, on the one hand, the richest man in the world who is the CEO of these major companies and, on the other hand, this person who is acting very impulsively, some would say destructively, capriciously laying people off - more than half the staff at one blow. What was he actually like to work with? ROTH: I was, more than anything else, struck by the fact that he operates a lot like other business executives do, which is if you put good information in front of him and make recommendations and ask him to evaluate the facts of an issue, he does so quite thoughtfully. SHAPIRO: Give us an example. ROTH: A notable example of this is the satirical website The Babylon Bee, which had been restricted on Twitter after violating the company's hateful conduct rules related to misgendering of trans people. And Mr. Musk asked me and the trust and safety team to reinstate the account. He bought the company for $44 billion, and so that decision is eminently within his right. But I asked him a series of questions - whether we were changing our policies about misgendering and whether his intent was to make misgendering permissible under the Twitter rules, whereas previously we banned it. I asked him whether he intended to just make a one-off exception for the account of The Babylon Bee, but not change the underlying policies. He was convinced ultimately that taking that kind of one-off action would undermine Twitter's rules and would create sort of gaps in consistency of enforcement that would make Twitter a less trustworthy place. SHAPIRO: So how do you reconcile that with his later decision to have a user poll about whether to allow Donald Trump back on the platform, which seems like the definition of capricious? ROTH: An old phrase that was a product development mantra at Facebook that I think has been attributed to Mark Zuckerberg is move fast and break things. And I think that mentality can explain a lot of what's happened at Twitter. The company has been criticized for years for being entirely too slow. It seems that in place of that perhaps overly slow culture, Mr. Musk is introducing a culture of moving quickly and unfortunately breaking things as a result. And I think the 24-hour polls to make massive platform governance decisions are an example of something that enables quick decision-making, but I'm not convinced that it enables rigorous decision-making. SHAPIRO: You said that Twitter is in a moment of transition, and I want to talk about what that transition means for users, including outside of the U. S. , where most Twitter users are. I spoke last week with Alexandra Givens of the Center for Democracy and Technology. Her organization serves on Twitter's trust and safety council. And she was really worried about Elon Musk's decision to lay off Twitter's entire human rights team. Here's what she said. ALEXANDRA GIVENS: The company was trying. There were important moments where they took a stand to defend the rights of users to spread important messages online and to push back on instances of government repression or authoritarian efforts. SHAPIRO: So, Yoel, what do you think the future of Twitter for people who advocate for human rights, for people who push back against government oppression is likely to be? ROTH: One of the most important uses of Twitter over the years has been the use of speaking truth to power through the platform, and enabling that use safely requires constant investment by a lot of people. Twitter is known in the industry for being a company that has regularly gone to court to defend the privacy of its users. If you are a human rights activist in a country that is hostile to activism or an embedded journalist or a queer person in a country where that's illegal, your very ability to participate as your true self online is contingent on being able to not share some parts of your true self, not just publicly, but also with a company like Twitter. I truly hope that that practice doesn't go away under Mr. Musk. SHAPIRO: Well, except that people who would do that have, for the most part, been laid off, right? ROTH: And I think that's the real risk. You can't do this work with a skeleton crew. SHAPIRO: And so what does that mean for the human rights advocates, the free speech activists? ROTH: I think people need to very thoughtfully and carefully weigh the costs and benefits of using Twitter, given their personal security situation. And that's a terrifying prospect to have to come to terms with, especially for many people who have spent the better part of a decade building a platform and an audience and a community on Twitter. SHAPIRO: So you left Twitter pretty abruptly. And you did not sign a nondisclosure agreement. Other execs who left in the earlier days did sign NDAs. And I'm curious. If those people could talk, what do you think they'd be saying right now? ROTH: One of the defining traits of Twitter was a culture of care and of empathy. And many of the people I spoke with were personally and professionally heartbroken about the fact that that culture might be going away. Above all else, I think the people who choose to work at Twitter generally didn't choose to work at the company because it was the easiest job or the best-paid job. They chose to work there because they believed in the impact that Twitter could have in the world. Twitter is one of the most consequential communication platforms in existence. And what happens on Twitter can move markets, can change elections, and it can impact the safety of millions of people around the world. And more than anything else, people are worried about what will happen, given Twitter's importance in the world, if there isn't a team left to do that type of work. SHAPIRO: You describe your former colleagues as being heartbroken. And you very dispassionately kind of described what the consequences might be of this transition that Twitter is in. As dispassionate as you are in describing this, is it tough for you to watch what's happening right now? ROTH: It is. I'm heartbroken and devastated by what I see happening at the company and what I see happening to decades of investment by professionals into building the service into what it is. But I think we need to have two parallel conversations. We can be upset and concerned about what's happening at Twitter specifically, but we would be remiss if we only had that conversation. We should think about what the trade-offs here are trying to strike a balance between three factors that are often in enormous tension with each other, and those are safety, speech and privacy. And the work of trying to find the right equilibrium there is difficult, if not completely impossible, and yet you still have to do it. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SHAPIRO: That's Yoel Roth.

Trying to strike a balance between three factors that are often in enormous tension with each other - those are safety, speech and privacy - and the work of trying to find the right equilibrium there is difficult, if not completely impossible. And yet you still have to do it. SHAPIRO: Yoel Roth, former head of trust and safety at Twitter. Thank you for talking to us, and good luck in your next chapter. ROTH: Thanks so much for having me.

The former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried is under investigation for financial crimes. But he and his lawyers, meanwhile, are also making allegations about hackers pilfering customers' digital cash. NPR cybersecurity correspondent Jenna McLaughlin is here to explain. Hey, Jenna. JENNA MCLAUGHLIN, BYLINE: Hey there. MARTIN: So this scandal has gotten so big, I understand, that investors are suing big names - Tom Brady and Steph Curry. What? MCLAUGHLIN: Yeah, it's pretty wild. To summarize, Sam Bankman-Fried, in 2018, he created what's called a cryptocurrency exchange, which is a place to trade, exchange, buy, sell different forms of cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. And it quickly got really popular, including with celebrities. But Fried also had this second company, Alameda Capital, which was his own, personal trading firm. The investigation, of course, is still ongoing. But what's been alleged is he took money from investors in FTX. And he used it to trade with through Alameda and lost it. MARTIN: OK. But draw the connection for me, Jenna. What does this have to do with cybersecurity? Is anyone accusing anyone else of stealing funds besides the founder? MCLAUGHLIN: Yeah, that's actually where things get a little bit tricky. Bankman-Fried and his lawyers have alleged that it's not just FTX's mistakes that have left investors with empty pockets. They say that there's also been a breach after they declared bankruptcy and that they've hired a cybersecurity firm to investigate. Though, I'm not sure which one. Most recently, Bankman-Fried has changed his tune a little bit. During a live interview with The New York Times Wednesday night, he said he believes some money was seized by Bahamian and U. S. authorities. But he still alleged that an unknown third party took the rest. Regardless of whether hackers took the money, though, it is true the cryptocurrency exchanges are pretty vulnerable to cyberattacks. MARTIN: So explain why. And shouldn't that be quite troublesome? MCLAUGHLIN: Yeah, absolutely. That does create some confusion, because you've probably heard of this thing called a blockchain. . . MARTIN: Right. MCLAUGHLIN: . . . Which is a secure record of digital transactions that can't be altered. But once you move your money to exchanges, rather than keeping it safe in your virtual wallet, that's where the danger comes. So I spoke to Megan Stifel. She's the chief strategy officer for the Institute for Security and Technology. And she's testified about this topic for Congress. Here's how she put it. MEGAN STIFEL: Not being a regulated space or commonly regulated space, there isn't this kind of - as there is in the financial services sector, per se, more broadly - requirements around cybersecurity. MCLAUGHLIN: And she said that that has led to some pretty big breaches in the past. For example, in October, one of the biggest exchanges, Binance, reported potential losses of up to half a billion dollars after a hack. MARTIN: So when all this settles - and it may be a while before it does, with all these charges and allegations - do you believe, Jenna, based on your reporting, that all this is going to inspire new cybersecurity requirements? MCLAUGHLIN: So my source, Megan Stifel, said that she thinks it's too soon to say, especially since we don't know if a breach happened here. Like you mentioned, it could be a while before we get answers. But she said that it might be a chance for lawmakers or other countries - FTX is in the Bahamas, for example - to think about how existing regulations might apply to cryptocurrencies. Even so, it's not a total disaster as is for investigators because there are a lot of tools in place to investigate these kinds of crimes that already exist. Cybercriminals, for example, often think that cryptocurrency is really anonymous, when in reality, that blockchain that I mentioned earlier does actually record every transaction. Plus, the process of actually turning virtual currency into cash isn't always so easy. MARTIN: Right. NPR cybersecurity correspondent Jenna McLaughlin. Thanks. MCLAUGHLIN: Thank you.

The Columbia Journalism Review released a new database tool called Are You Pressworthy? It calculates the number of stories your disappearance would get based on certain factors like your age, race, gender and geographic location. The new tool shows us how racial bias continues to affect media coverage. NPR's Jonathan Franklin has the story. JONATHAN FRANKLIN, BYLINE: Thousands of people are reported missing in the U. S. each year. And while not every missing person case will get huge media attention, the urge to locate them is always the main priority. But when it comes to missing person cases involving people of color, that same media attention is often nonexistent. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)GWEN IFILL: Why not the same media attention when people of color go missing? Well, the answer actually has a name - Missing White Woman Syndrome. FRANKLIN: The phrase, coined by the late journalist Gwen Ifill, calls out the media's fascination with covering attractive, middle class-looking white women in comparison to missing persons of color. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)IFILL: I call it the Missing White Woman Syndrome. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: (Laughter). IFILL: If there's a missing white woman, we are going to cover that every day. FRANKLIN: This so-called media phenomenon never really sat right with Kyle Pope, the editor and publisher of the Columbia Journalism Review. KYLE POPE: Everybody talks about it occasionally. Everybody says, we got to do something about it. And nothing happened. FRANKLIN: To start that conversation on how we should cover stories involving missing people, the Columbia Journalism Review launched a new tool that allows you to openly share your press value with the world if you were to go missing. The tool estimates that younger white women would get increasingly more news coverage than other racial groups such as Black, Latino and Indigenous people. POPE: And the implications of this are literally life and death. The amount of media coverage you get immediately after you go missing has a direct result on what happens to your case. FRANKLIN: It's no secret that missing person cases across the U. S. are becoming more common. More than 600,000 people go missing in the U. S. each year, and that's according to data from the National Crime Information Center. And research shows that in 2021 alone, at least 521,000 people were reported missing, with 40% of those cases being missing persons of color. But sadly, 38% of people who go missing in the U. S. are Black, which is double the U. S. Black population of about 14%. NATALIE WILSON: I will say this. We are not naive to believe that every missing person's case will get national media coverage. FRANKLIN: That's Natalie Wilson, the co-founder of the Black and Missing Foundation, a nonprofit dedicated to bringing awareness to the cases of missing persons of color. She says that the organization not only brings awareness to missing Black people, but goes above and beyond by helping families in the search for their missing loved one. WILSON: What we're trying to do is to change that narrative, to show that our missing are - they're important, too. FRANKLIN: Loved ones like the family of Daniel Robinson are also on that same mission, bringing awareness to Daniel's sudden disappearance nearly 18 months ago. Daniel's father, David, says that when it came to his son, a Black man, it was extremely difficult to get any sort of media attention about his disappearance. DAVID ROBINSON: Media wasn't really at the time reaching back out, so I had to keep pressing and pressing, but it took a lot of hard work. FRANKLIN: In the end, Wilson says that both media and everyday people have a responsibility to address this issue. WILSON: We all have a responsibility to not only stand up for ourselves but to raise awareness about this issue. It's really a pandemic that's affecting our community.

But hundreds of miles of new fiber optic cable are on the way. Federal money is bringing broadband to remote Alaska Native communities. NPR's Nina Kravinsky reports from the western Alaska town of Bethel. NINA KRAVINSKY, BYLINE: The city of 6,000 is about 400 miles off the road system, so there aren't a lot of options for shoppers. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Cash only. KRAVINSKY: On a recent weekend, an internet outage forced the grocery store to only accept cash for a couple of days. Without a way to use her debit card, Balassa Larson couldn't pay for some of her food. BALASSA LARSON: Maybe I'll go on a diet (laughter). KRAVINSKY: Internet outages are fairly common in this part of rural Alaska, which uses radio waves to get internet to customers. But Bethel Native Corporation President Ana Hoffman says a better way is coming. ANA HOFFMAN: This is going to be a transformational change. KRAVINSKY: The Native Corporation is taking on a fiber optic cable project that will bring high-speed internet to several remote Alaska communities. Funding comes from $1,000,000,000 the federal government set aside for tribal broadband programs across the country. HOFFMAN: This is the way of the future, is having good connectivity. And so we will just be in line to participate. KRAVINSKY: Hoffman says the project will bring internet to Bethel through a company called GCI, currently the only internet provider in the area. Right now, GCI's customers in Bethel pay about $300 a month for much slower service than customers in urban areas. GCI spokesperson Heather Handyside says that's about to change. HEATHER HANDYSIDE: So 200 times faster and more than $100 cheaper. The cost of the plans may slightly change over the years, but it will be exactly what we have in Anchorage. KRAVINSKY: GCI is betting on fiber optic as the future of internet in rural Alaska, even as low-orbit satellite services like Starlink continue to ramp up. GCI sees fiber as more reliable than satellites. (SOUNDBITE OF PLANE FLYING)KRAVINSKY: Not far from Bethel is Napaskiak, a village of around 400. It's only accessible by plane this time of year. Leaders expect the fiber optic cable will reach them by 2025. Napaskiak tribal administrator Sharon Williams says it can't come soon enough. SHARON WILLIAMS: We never had that fast internet. Some of us - like, we go to Anchorage. We get to see how fast it is. As a community, I don't know. I can't imagine how it will be for us. KRAVINSKY: But Williams does know faster internet will make it possible to apply for more grants to improve public health and safety, and her staff will miss fewer online trainings. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Here, take one for Calvin (ph) so he can airraq. KRAVINSKY: Back in Bethel, Native Corporation President Ana Hoffman is teaching a group of kids a game similar to cat's cradle. They're knitting a knotted piece of yarn between their fingers to make shapes. A broom or a bird are common ones. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: Boom. You did it. KRAVINSKY: The Yup'ik word for this game is airraq. It's also called a story string, and Hoffman chose it as a name for the project. HOFFMAN: We have such a rich life. We have so much cultural knowledge and expression. We're going to have the ability to share the beauty of our culture with the rest of the world.

Its 320,000 citizens live across a chain of islands, plus the U. N. deemed the country most vulnerable to natural disaster. After first detecting a breach, things only got worse.

MCLAUGHLIN: There's still very little information out there about what happened. Those sources who spoke to NPR suggested Vanuatu had been hit by ransomware. The U. S. has had its fair share of damage inflicted by cybercriminals. But recently, the Pacific region has been getting hammered. Just last month, two major Australian companies were breached, prompting a strong response from Home Affairs Minister Clare O'Neil. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)CLARE O'NEIL: A number of people have said this is a big wake-up call for our country. We cannot allow this to continue. MCLAUGHLIN: In a call with reporters, O'Neil said that the Australian government would pursue the \"Russian thugs\" - her words - who stole people's health care information. Australian officials are on the ground helping get Vanuatu back online. Part of the urgency may be fears that China could take advantage of the situation to deepen ties to the island nation by offering assistance or technology. Vanuatu is officially neutral and maintains friendships with both Beijing and Washington. As of last Wednesday, the Vanuatu prime minister said 70% of systems have been restored, but questions remain about the impact of the monthlong outage. Jenna McLaughlin, NPR News.

MCLAUGHLIN: There's still very little information out there about what happened. Those sources who spoke to NPR suggested Vanuatu had been hit by ransomware. The U. S. has had its fair share of damage inflicted by cybercriminals. But recently, the Pacific region has been getting hammered. Just last month, two major Australian companies were breached, prompting a strong response from Home Affairs Minister Clare O'Neil. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CLARE O'NEIL: A number of people have said this is a big wake-up call for our country. We cannot allow this to continue. MCLAUGHLIN: In a call with reporters, O'Neil said that the Australian government would pursue the \"Russian thugs\" - her words - who stole people's health care information. Australian officials are on the ground helping get Vanuatu back online. Part of the urgency may be fears that China could take advantage of the situation to deepen ties to the island nation by offering assistance or technology. Vanuatu is officially neutral and maintains friendships with both Beijing and Washington. As of last Wednesday, the Vanuatu prime minister said 70% of systems have been restored, but questions remain about the impact of the monthlong outage.

I am Terry Gross. Ever since Elon Musk, the richest man in the world, bought Twitter for $44 billion in late April, Twitter has been in chaos. Musk has made and then withdrawn decisions including trying to retract his offer to buy Twitter. He's fired executives, cut the number of full-time employees in half, and then realized maybe he'd gone too far and tried to hire back some people he just terminated. He's floated ideas for subscription services and for charging a fee to verify that your account is really yours. But those ideas were met with widespread opposition. The number of content moderators has been slashed. Hate speech on Twitter has increased. Musk offered to reinstate Trump on Twitter after polling Twitter users about whether to do it. Some of the responders may have been bots. My guest, Casey Newton, says Musk has been remaking Twitter in his own image. Newton is an independent tech journalist who covers the intersection of technology and democracy for his newsletter, Platformer, which is hosted by Substack. He also co-hosts the tech podcast \"Hard Fork\" with New York Times tech journalist Kevin Roose. From 2013 until 2020, when Newton started Platformer, he reported on tech for The Verge. We recorded our interview yesterday. Casey Newton, welcome back to FRESH AIR. SpaceX and Tesla have been considered such big success stories, and credit has gone to Elon Musk. Twitter is showing a different side of him - indecisive, making decisions then retracting them. Twitter is losing money and advertisers under his leadership. He's making decisions that are driving away Twitter users. Are you surprised by what kind of leader he's turned out to be as the owner of Twitter? CASEY NEWTON: You know, I really am. I had not paid a lot of attention to what Musk was doing at Tesla and SpaceX, but as you note, he was having a lot of success with those companies. And the Twitter that he inherited, while it had its challenges, was not a company in crisis. It made about $5 billion last year, has hundreds of millions of active users. And while it clearly needed to evolve, there was sort of no pressing need to blow it up and start over. And yet from the moment that he stepped into that job, that seems to be exactly what he decided to do. He has now eliminated close to three-quarters of the staff. He has implemented a bunch of ideas and then quickly reversed himself. And more than anything else, I think he's given the impression that rather than operating according to some set plan, he's really managing Twitter more by whims and what seems to him to be a good idea in the moment. And so that's led to a lot of chaos. GROSS: Do you think Twitter is starting to reflect Elon Musk's politics? And what are his politics? NEWTON: Well, I think that in a lot of ways, he is a fairly conventional conservative. You know, he has adopted a lot of the views that have become mainstream among Republicans such as that social networks are censoring too much content, that free speech is at risk, that there are sort of too much deference shown to people who say that they're experiencing harassment or abuse or hate speech. And he wants to end those practices. So, you know, one of his first moves was to restore more than 60,000 accounts of people who had been banned from Twitter for breaking its rules. And I think that's sort of very much in keeping with this conservative world view, that it should not be up to platforms to decide who can participate or sort of set the terms by which they might participate. Another way that we've seen Elon Musk's more conservative views manifest is he has lately been having a lot of fun with what he's calling the Twitter files. The Twitter files had to do with a New York Post story from the 2020 election about Hunter Biden's laptop. Twitter and Facebook intervened to temporarily restrict the distribution of that story because it looked like it was part of a sort of hack-and-leak-propaganda operation, which they were on high alert for. And they worried that somebody might be interfering with the election. Well, fast forward to today, and now a lot of Republicans believe that the platforms themselves interfered in the election by not allowing that story to spread quite as rapidly as it might have otherwise. Thisis something that Elon Musk clearly believes, and he has now been releasing a bunch of internal documents. He shared them with a couple of other journalists, who have been posting about them on Twitter. And this is essentially red meat for the Republican base. You know, I would not be surprised if we saw hearings about this in the House of Representatives next year, right? So all these things are just sort of, you know, Elon being a good conservative and riling up that base. And he has spent a lot of time since he took over Twitter doing just that. GROSS: So in terms of whether Twitter may now be reflecting Elon Musk's politics, Musk re-platformed over 60,000 people including Donald Trump, who used Twitter to, you know, say mistruths, disinformation. This is a person who wants to cancel part of the Constitution and who also was responsible for a lot of hate speech on Twitter. And then, you know, Musk re-platformed Kanye West in spite of Kanye West's antisemitism and then canceled the re-platforming in another kind of sudden change of mind. And of the 64,000 people or so that Elon Musk brought back to Twitter, people who had been canceled because of violations of Twitter rules including hate speech - you know, why would he want to bring back people who were responsible for hate speech? Hate speech is dangerous. It can really physically harm people. So how does that reflect, if at all, Musk's politics? NEWTON: So what he has said about his view on this subject is that he believes that as long as you have not broken the law, you should effectively have unfettered access to social platforms, that - and this is just sort of a very glib understanding of free speech, I would say, where if you - you should just sort of have the right to speech, and almost nothing can take that away. And, you know, here in the United States, there's all sorts of horrible things that you can say. And under the First Amendment, you can't be prosecuted for those. Musk essentially wants to bring that idea to this platform that he now owns. But I think it's worth talking a bit about why that isn't an approach taken by any other platform. And it's because most of us just don't want to be in rooms, whether they're real rooms or virtual rooms, with people who are preaching, you know, a gospel of hate, whether they're - you know, where they're spreading fictions or whether they're just sort of, you know, committing antisocial behavior. So there is this market. . . GROSS: Or harassing you. NEWTON: Yeah, exactly, right? If somebody's harassing you, you want to get out of there. And what I think that Musk and some of these other, like, right-wing platform commentators are missing is that there's a real market demand for this kind of basic content moderation, you know? And I just always sort of laugh because all of these guys - and it is mostly guys - think of themselves as the smartest business people in the entire world, and they can't believe that - you know, what all these woke liberals are doing to - you know, to these businesses. And yet I think we're going to see, over time, that they're going to turn out to be - they're going to lose a lot of money on these platforms 'cause they're not responding to what the market actually wants here, which is just basic content moderation. GROSS: Hate speech has increased since Musk took over. Are you seeing that? Are you seeing examples of that? NEWTON: We have seen some studies that have said that. I would say that some analysts who I really respect have questioned the methodology of those accounts. And so I'm not willing to say definitively that we've seen a massive rise in hate speech. However, the fact that they've restored thousands of accounts of people who did get kicked off for hate speech, that is very real. And so I think we have to assume that if hate speech hasn't increased on Twitter yet, it likely is going to happen in the coming weeks and months. GROSS: Do you think Elon Musk's public image has totally changed, that he's seen now as being more indecisive and incompetent? NEWTON: You know, I really do. And, you know, I should say, I am somebody who, in a lot of ways, was really rooting for Elon Musk here. Twitter has had a history of mismanagement. You know, two CEOs ago, it had a guy who was working two jobs at the same time. The company was really suffering as a result of that. And so I think, like a lot of people, I hoped that Elon, who had all this previous success, could come in and whatever the heck he was doing at Tesla and SpaceX maybe, you know, sprinkle a little bit of that magic on Twitter, and the platform will become a better version of itself. And yet, unfortunately, after he took over, he continuously rejected the advice of people who'd worked at Twitter for, you know, five, 10 years, who were able to predict for him exactly what was going to happen if he took the steps that he took. And he just kind of ignored those people and threw away their advice and fired them. And then he took these actions and then exactly what they predicted came true. And he found himself in a lot of trouble. And that's the main reason why I think that Elon's reputation has taken a hit. It's not so much that he made mistakes. Every CEO makes mistakes. It's that the effects of his actions were accurately predicted for him by his own employees, and he just ignored them every step of the way and has kind of continuously found himself in trouble. So I do think that that has changed the public conversation around what kind of leader he is. GROSS: You know, you reported - you've spoken to, you know, current and former Twitter employees and interviewed a Twitter engineer about his experiences working there and his experiences being laid off from there or terminated. And what you learned was that, you know, part of the engineering staff was asked to make, you know, a very technical presentation about how Twitter operates to Elon Musk. And they were kind of shocked about how little Musk really understood about the technical end of the operation. NEWTON: Yeah, that's right. You know, so something about Elon Musk is that he sort of worships at the altar of the engineer. And as soon as he took over Twitter, basically job one for him was to bring in a bunch of his engineers from Tesla and some of his other companies to try to figure out who's a good engineer at Twitter. And more recently, they've started to do these impromptu code reviews, they call them, where they sort of summon you to an office. And they say, you know, show me every line of code you've written over the past week. So he really styles himself as this very technical person. And yet, as you note, we have talked with folks who have said that, indeed, when they go to show him that code, he isn't really understanding what they're saying. Now, that's not true in every case, and I'm not saying that Elon Musk can't write a line of code. But for somebody who styles himself as this, you know, brilliant engineer, I have talked with Twitter employees who have been surprised at the lack of depth of his technical knowledge. GROSS: Well, let's take a short break here and then we'll talk some more. If you're just joining us, my guest is Casey Newton, who writes about tech for his newsletter Platformer, which is hosted by Substack. We'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF SLOWBERN'S \"WHEN WAR WAS KING\")GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to my interview with Casey Newton, who writes about the intersection of technology and democracy for his newsletter, Platformer, which is hosted by Substack. He's been reporting on the chaos at Twitter ever since Elon Musk bought it for $44 billion in late October. What's left of Twitter's staff? I think he fired about 20% of his full-time staff and 80% of contractors? NEWTON: The numbers were even higher than that. And it's happened in several rounds, so it's sort of hard to keep up. There was an initial cut of about 50% to the core full-time employees. Then, as you note, about 80% of contractors got let go. Then he sent out an email to everyone saying, hey, you know, things - life is about to get even more difficult around here and you need to be extremely hardcore if you want to stay. And if you want to stay, like, click this button. Well, after that, a lot of people chose to take a severance package instead. So we now believe that Twitter has around 2,000 employees or fewer, and that's down from about 8,000 when he took over. GROSS: Well, you know, the first time you were on our show, you were talking about content moderators on Facebook and how many of them get PTSD because they're - these are the people who have to look at all the, like, beheading videos and the murder videos and all the most horrible videos that Facebook would be taking down 'cause they're making the decision about whether to take these down or not. And so, you know, it sounded like a really stressful job. What's left of content moderators now on Twitter? Because on the one hand, tens of thousands of Twitter users who were de-platformed, who were taken down from Twitter, have been reinstated by Musk. And, you know, a certain percentage of them - I don't know what percentage - were taken down because of hate speech, because of behavior that wasn't tolerated on Twitter. So you're adding people who are responsible for hate speech and you're firing people who are content moderators. So what's left of the content moderation crew? NEWTON: So, you know, Twitter will not tell us how many content moderators it has left. The company no longer has a communications department. So, you know, we're - we reporters are all used to just, you know, emailing our friends over in PR. And with Twitter, that's no longer possible. So we don't have a good answer to that question. What we - you know, what I've reported and have come to understand is that the vast majority of the content moderators have been let go. And I have friends and sources who work in a field that they call trust and safety, and they're basically the people who work at these companies to try to keep the platforms safe. And they've been pointing out to me, like, look, if you search for this hashtag, which, you know, used to sort of be blocked on Twitter, didn't used to return very many results, it's now starting to show some really problematic stuff. So there is absolutely concern that Twitter is filling up with the sort of stuff that content moderators would have been able to eliminate if they were still around. You know, at the same time, Twitter's, like, rules - you know, every platform sets rules for what you can and can't do on the platform. Like, those haven't changed at all. If you, you know, Google the Twitter community standards, you'll find them, that there have been no changes since Musk took over. And yet, as you note, he just restored, you know, a bunch of, you know, neo-Nazis and other people to the platform. So, like, what are the rules on Twitter? You know, who knows? We really are just in a moment of pure chaos. GROSS: You know, you describe what's happened at Twitter to employees as a purge. An engineer who you - a Twitter engineer who you interviewed was fired and got this email. We regret to inform you that your employment is terminated effective immediately. Your recent behavior has violated company policy. What was the violation? NEWTON: Well, this person didn't know because it wasn't clear what policy they were referring to. You know, one of the waves of people being let go happened as Elon and his associates noticed that Twitter workers were being somewhat critical of his behavior, both in the company's Slack channels and sometimes even publicly on Twitter. And they just started to get rid of those people. And they would just say, well, you know, you violated company policy. And, you know, the sources I spoke with sort of were throwing up their hands and saying, what policy are you talking about? You know, at Twitter - some people hear that and they say, well, look, if you were making fun of the boss, of course you got fired. That would happen anywhere. And that's, you know, true as far as it goes. But at Twitter, they had this culture of always criticizing power. You know, they believed that it sort of made the company stronger if they could question decisions being made by their leaders in public. And so this really did come as a huge shock to them. And I actually think some of them are probably going to sue the company over it because they feel like it was a wrongful termination. GROSS: Musk became obsessed with the idea that his employees might sabotage Twitter. Is that a sign - do you think that's a sign of paranoia or a legitimate concern? NEWTON: I think it was mostly paranoia. You know, most of the folks who I've been speaking with at Twitter over the past couple of months cared about the service a lot. And, in fact, the reason why they were staying on in spite of a lot of chaos all around them was because they wanted the Twitter service to stay up. They believed in it. But Musk really - particularly, I think, as he started to see criticisms of himself and his associates and Slack and on Twitter, he really did start to believe some of these people are going to go rogue and somehow sabotage the site. And so he undertook a purge. GROSS: Are there employees who think that Musk is sabotaging Twitter in his attempt to blow it up? NEWTON: There are. GROSS: And remake it, you know, and remake it his way? Yeah. NEWTON: Well, I think - the employees I've spoken to believe that the motivation is likely more financial. You know, as you'll recall, he spent $44 billion on Twitter. Almost everyone agrees that that was way more than the service was worth. The price crashed basically as soon as he bought it in the public stock markets, along with all the other tech stocks. And so now the company is loaded up with about $13 billion in debt. It has to pay a billion dollars a year just in interest to service that debt. And some folks believe that what Elon really wants to do is just blow the whole thing up so that he can restructure that debt and make Twitter cheaper after all. I will say I don't really buy that. I don't think that there is a master plan. I think Elon's waking up every day and just deciding what seems like the best thing to do that day, and that he's not trying to sabotage the site. But is it an idea out there that's going around among employees? It is. GROSS: So one of the changes that Musk told employees he was making was that they could no longer work remotely, that they had to come into the office. And I think a lot of employees were upset by that, particularly ones who might have, you know, taken the job with the understanding that they could stay at home and take care of, you know, children or parents or grandparents or whatever their reason was to want to work at home and that suddenly the ground rules were being changed. Now, a lot of offices changed their ground rules about working from home. But how did that go over at Twitter? And how did Musk respond to the negative reaction? NEWTON: Well, you know, as you can imagine, this is an extraordinarily disruptive thing for people who had taken these jobs assuming that they would be able to work where ever they wanted to. So a lot of folks don't work near one of the Twitter offices. And they received an email that said essentially, within a day, you need to be able to report to Twitter headquarters. And unless you have either a really good reason or you are an exceptional talent, we're not going to let you work remotely. And, of course, you know, how do you define an exceptional talent? There was sort of no further information on who might qualify under that plan. And so people did start to make other plans. You know, that that was sort of a big reason why some people quit the company because ultimately they just decided, you know, this wasn't worth uprooting their entire lives for. For other people, though, I think it will probably be the basis of some sort of lawsuit because they will say, look, you know, you can't sort of unilaterally tell me that I just have to show up, you know, after hiring me to do this job that you told me that I could do remotely. So that's kind of how it played out among employees. You know, for Elon, I think his perspective is anything he does that leads an unhappy person to quit is good. Like, right now, he's in a mode of trying to figure out who is loyal to him at Twitter and who he can sort of count on to be a good engineer. And everything else is just kind of noise and he doesn't really worry about it. GROSS: Well, let's take another break here. If you're just joining us, my guest is Casey Newton, who reports on tech issues for his newsletter Platformer, which is hosted on Substack. We'll talk more about the chaos at Twitter ever since Elon Musk took over in late October after a break. I'm Terry Gross, And this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MISHA MENGELBERG TRIO'S \"A BIT NERVOUS\")GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Let's get back to the interview I recorded yesterday with Casey Newton, who writes about the intersection of technology and democracy for his newsletter, Platformer, which is hosted by Substack. He also co-hosts the tech podcast \"Hard Fork\" with New York Times reporter Kevin Roose. Newton has been writing about the changes and the chaos at Twitter since Elon Musk bought it for $44 billion in late October. So is part of Elon Musk's goal in slashing the staff at Twitter by about 50% for full-time employees as part of the goal to, like, cut costs? NEWTON: Yes, it is. He spent a lot of money on Twitter, and he needs to figure out how to make the site profitable. You know, for most of its history, Twitter has not been a profitable company, and it arguably had hired too many people. You know, I think even if Elon Musk had not taken over the company, Twitter probably would have undergone some pretty significant layoffs this year. I think it probably would have been closer to 25%. But as he tries to figure out what the next incarnation of Twitter should be, he wants to really get rid of a lot of employees because that's his single biggest cost. GROSS: Musk said that the financial situation at Twitter was dire, and the company could even go bankrupt. What's the upside of saying that publicly? NEWTON: (Laughter) You know, I wish I knew. I have since learned that he apparently has said a version of this at some of his other companies as well. He seems to like leaning on the drama of that a little bit to rally the troops. That's not how I would rally the troops. But I think he wants to sort of inspire in employees a sense of fear that unless they work really hard and do their best, the company and then their job might go away. But I also think it gives him cover to do a lot of the things that we've seen, right? - getting rid of absolutely huge numbers of people, sometimes without even fully understanding what they did to the point that you have to go beg them to come back after you've gotten rid of them, right? But if you tell people, like, hey, we might go bankrupt, all of a sudden, a lot of options are on the table that might otherwise not be. GROSS: One of Musk's strategies that seems to have backfired is dealing with verification. Can you describe what verification is and what Twitter's policy had been before Musk took over? NEWTON: Yeah. So Twitter started a verification policy in 2009, and the basic idea was that it needed a way to verify that the owner of an account was who they said it was. So if you were a politician, a journalist or a celebrity, if you were really that person, Twitter would verify that, and then you would get this little blue check mark on your profile. That's how it had always worked. Musk came along and said he wanted verification to be open to a much wider number of people, which, by the way, I thought was a pretty good idea. I think there are a lot of good reasons why you might want people to be able to optionally verify their identity on Twitter. It can just sort of be good for the service overall. But he made one really bad decision, which was that not only did he offer everyone a verification badge, it was no longer actually connected to any sort of idea of verification. All you needed to do was pay $8. You could create any account; you would get that little badge. And so people started to pretend to be brands. They started to be celebrities. They started to pretend to be Elon Musk. And that same blue verification badge that had only ever meant you are who you say you are all of a sudden now meant I have $8. GROSS: (Laughter). NEWTON: And so there was two days of just absolute chaos on Twitter as people sort of raced to see how much fun they could have with this ridiculous new system, wherefore, predictably, he pulled the plug and said they would start over. GROSS: And one of the consequences of that was that he lost a lot of advertisers. Can you explain why? NEWTON: Yeah. So advertisers are obsessed with what they call brand safety, which is basically just the idea that any of their ads are not going to appear next to something horrible, but also that they counted on verification to let people know that their brand was what it said it was. So, you know, one of the most famous examples from this disaster is that someone created a fake account pretending to be Eli Lilly and then saying, insulin is free. And then, the real Eli Lilly had to come along and say, oh, no, no, we're still going to, you know, massively overcharge you for insulin. So in the wake of this, you have a lot of advertisers saying, you know what? Why are we spending money to be here? No one is even going to be able to tell if our brand is the real brand. And so you start to see this huge pullback in advertising as people just decide, you know what? We're going to sit this out for a while, while we wait to see what Elon is going to do. GROSS: Twitter's largest brand advertiser is, or was, Apple. Apple pulled their advertising. Has Apple come back? NEWTON: Yes. So there was a summit between Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple, and Elon Musk a couple of days after Elon had started what seemed like a pretty unwise war against the company. And Elon Musk has since tweeted that Apple has resumed its advertising as normal. It's really important for Twitter. Apple is its single largest brand advertiser, so losing them would have been really hard on Twitter. It seems, for now, like that has been put to rest. GROSS: Musk recently tweeted his thanks to returning advertisers. How many returned? And why did they return? NEWTON: I'm still trying to learn the answer to this question. I don't understand what has happened on Twitter in the past two weeks that would make any advertiser say now it feels safe. You still have all of these, you know, accounts that have been brought back from the dead to say terrible things. You still do not have a clear answer on what their verification program is going to look like going forward. And so I don't really understand why these folks have come back. And I don't understand how many have come back. You know, as I've been reporting on this, you know, my understanding is that Twitter's ad sales are still down from where they were expected to be. We're in the middle of what should be their busiest season. Not only is it the holidays, but the World Cup is traditionally one of the busiest times on Twitter, you know, every four years. And I think the advertisers are still down. So there are still some things I don't know there. But I would honestly be shocked if, you know, two months from now, Twitter's ad business was looking robust. GROSS: Well, let's take another break here. If you're just joining us, my guest is Casey Newton, who writes about tech for his newsletter, Platformer, which is hosted by Substack. We'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF AMY RIGBY SONG, \"PLAYING PITTSBURGH\")GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to my interview with Casey Newton, who writes about the intersection of technology and democracy for his newsletter, Platformer. He's been reporting on the chaos at Twitter ever since Elon Musk bought it in late October. So getting back to the idea that Musk is kind of blowing up Twitter to remake it his way, he's losing so much money in the process. I mean, other ways that he's losing money - 'cause you've pointed this out - is re-platforming people and making all these changes. They're really expensive. It requires a lot of engineering changes in order to make these changes on Twitter. Plus, there's no longer as many engineers there now. So it's almost like he's sabotaging himself in trying to remake Twitter. NEWTON: Yeah, I think, you know, for some leaders, it's not a good idea unless they came up with it, right? And so people who worked at Twitter had all sorts of ideas about how you could improve the service, make it more profitable. Elon has gotten rid of most of those people, and he's fixated on a few core ideas that he thinks are going to be spectacular. Subscriptions is probably the biggest one although there are others. And he's just going to go for it. You know, this is probably one of the most self-confident people in the entire world, right? Elon Musk does not have impostor syndrome. He wakes up every day convinced that he is the only person who knows how to fix this company. And, you know, as me - for me, an observer, I just sort of sit back and think, like, none of this is working, you know? And so to me, the question is, will he ever acknowledge that other people have better ideas for this company than he does? Or will he just sort of continue to charge ahead with his own ideas, you know, regardless of if they're successful or not? GROSS: I'm wondering, like, did he ever announce projects and then, like, halt them or withdraw them at SpaceX or Tesla? Did he have a reputation for doing that there? NEWTON: Yeah, I mean, sort of the most famous one at Tesla is - Tesla has some autonomous driving capabilities. Elon calls it full self-driving even though, you know, automotive experts, I think, quibble with whether it is actually full self-driving. But the rollout has just been delayed and delayed and delayed and delayed. And, you know, now, you know, who knows sort of when it will ever come. So, yeah, there is definitely a history of these companies and making grandiose promises and then not following up, right? You might also remember the Cybertruck, a big, flashy truck that he announced and, you know, began taking preorders for. You know, my understanding is the Cybertruck has still not shipped. So there's a lot of announcing and then delaying in Elon's world. GROSS: You know, you also write that some CEOs are actually rooting for Musk. Why? NEWTON: Well, you know, during the last decade, tech workers gained a lot of power, right? As the industry grew, engineers were in short supply, highly in demand, became very well compensated. And in order to compete for them, companies would offer them all these famous perks, right? - so, you know, on-site daycare and laundry and we'll send a barber to your office, right? And that was really great for the tech workers. And the tech workers went a step further, and they started talking about issues like, you know, this company isn't really very diverse; we should try to make it more diverse. Or, you know, it seems like our company has a lot of dealings with the Chinese government; that makes us uncomfortable, right? So you saw walkouts. You saw worker organizing. And for the tech workers, I think that was a really positive thing. But there's this whole class of CEOs who regards that as a terrible mistake. And I think what you see in a lot of the CEOs rooting for Elon, which they're doing mostly quietly and behind the scenes, is they love the idea of a CEO who can begin to claw back some of that power - right? - someone who can put workers in what they see as their proper place, which is sort of silently working away for whatever the boss wants and no longer bringing up issues like diversity, equity and inclusion, complaining that they're not getting enough perks, right? This really is, I believe, about clawing back some of those gains that workers have made over the past 10 years and restoring this sort of more traditional everybody-just-do-what-the-boss-says kind of work experience. GROSS: You're still on Twitter, and you cover tech including Twitter. You have every reason to be on Twitter. So beyond your work as a journalist, why do you feel like you need Twitter? NEWTON: You know, Twitter is really the only social network I ever felt like I was good at. You know, I think I'm not pretty enough for Instagram. I'm not a good enough dancer for TikTok. GROSS: (Laughter). NEWTON: Like, I work in text, and Twitter has just always been a great place for people who like to write sentences. I've often thought that it's the funniest social network. You know, people just wake up every day, and they just tell jokes on Twitter in a way that makes me laugh, right? It's like you don't often laugh intentionally when you go on LinkedIn. So I've just always loved that about Twitter. And I hope that, you know, if Twitter doesn't survive all of this, that there is still something Twitter-like in the world for those of us who like to write and read sentences. GROSS: Do you think there's a chance that Twitter won't survive? NEWTON: You know, I try not to be too excitable on this point 'cause on one hand, I look at everything that's happened, and I think, well, how could it survive? (Laughter) Like, none of this seems like this is sustainable to me, you know? But at the same time, you know, Yahoo still exists. There are all sorts of websites from, you know, even the dot-com era that are still around in one form or another. So I think that Twitter will probably still be around in some form for some time to come. However, I also think that there's probably never been a better time to start a Twitter competitor. I do think that there is an opportunity for folks to understand what is powerful about Twitter to come in, rebuild it, probably change some things, probably not make it exactly like Twitter, but just sort of do it in a sort of straightforward, normal, less chaotic way than Musk is doing. And I think they might find some success. So that's sort of one of the big things I'm looking for in 2023, is who seizes opportunity and how well do they do? GROSS: You've also been writing about two cases that the Supreme Court will decide next year that you say could make life more difficult for tech platforms without doing much to address the harm that those platforms create. And this has to do with people who are suing platforms for saying that the platforms and what they posted encouraged terrorism and may have helped lead to terrorist attacks. In one case, the plaintiff's family member was killed in an ISIS attack. So tell us what the basic premise of these lawsuits are. NEWTON: Yeah. So you know, in the United States, we have this important law, Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. And it protects platforms from liability, in most cases, from what their users post. So even if you post something really terrible on a platform, generally speaking, you cannot sue a platform over that. What makes these cases interesting, particularly one of them, the Gonzalez case, is that the Gonzalez case is the first time the Supreme Court has agreed to take a case that could limit Section 230. And specifically, what the Gonzalez case is saying is that Google and YouTube should be held accountable for the videos that it recommended to people about ISIS and sort of recruiting people to ISIS. So why is that a big deal? Well, YouTube recommends millions and millions, if not billions, of videos to people. And if it is going to be legally liable for every video that it promotes, that is going to be terrifying to the company because much of the modern internet, most of the platforms that we use, are all built on things being recommended to us. And platforms have never before had to worry that what they recommend could get them into legal trouble. GROSS: So I guess the question is a recommendation free speech? Is it a free speech issue? NEWTON: Yeah. And, you know, I have spoken with First Amendment scholars who believe that recommendations are absolutely speech, and that it goes against our understanding of the First Amendment to suggest that a corporation could not say, watch this video, because in a lot of ways, that doesn't seem very different from a publisher of a newspaper telling you to read this article, right? But at the same time, we know that there are voices on the Supreme Court, led by Clarence Thomas, who have argued that Section 230 gives platforms too much protection and that it's time to start clawing some of those protections back. So scholars are really watching this case because there's not - we just really don't know how this one is going to go. GROSS: If the plaintiffs win and platforms like Google and YouTube are held responsible for recommending videos or text, that would be in conflict with laws in Florida and Texas that prevents social media platforms from taking down posts because of content. Can you explain the predicament that platforms would be in if the plaintiffs win the Supreme Court cases but a case comes up in Florida or Texas (laughter)? NEWTON: Yeah. And so these Florida and Texas laws that were passed this year essentially seek to make content moderation illegal. And this is very much in the Elon Musk school of thinking - right? - which is that we should just sort of have free speech and nothing else. And so, as you know, we could be in this world where platforms will be forced to carry speech, including hate speech, in places like Texas and Florida because it will be illegal to remove speech. But then if they recommend that speech via some sort of algorithm, they could also then be held legally liable for recommending that thing, which they are forced to carry and are not allowed to remove. So you know, I talked to the people who work on this stuff at platforms. And they have no idea how they would comply with these laws. They're completely at a loss. GROSS: Well, let's take another break here. If you're just joining us, my guest is Casey Newton, who writes about tech for his newsletter, Platform. We'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF BEASTIE BOYS SONG, \"NAMASTE\")GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to my interview with Casey Newton, who writes about the intersection of technology and democracy for his newsletter, Platformer, which is hosted by Substack. He's been reporting on the chaos at Twitter ever since Elon Musk bought it in late October. A related issue to the issue we've been talking about - about the responsibility of social media to have content moderation - TikTok is facing lawsuits about things like the blackout challenge. Would you describe what the blackout challenge is and what these lawsuits are saying? NEWTON: Yeah. So you know, this is a really dangerous stunt that's, you know, been around since I was a kid where kids will encourage one another to sort of use household objects to choke themselves unconscious, to then experience the adrenaline rush of suddenly regaining that consciousness. It has proven to be particularly dangerous on TikTok, in part, I think, just because it looks fun, you know? Kids see kids doing this. Of course, in the videos, everyone comes right back awake. And they are laughing and giggling. And you look over, you know, on the right side of the screen and that video's getting lots of likes. And it just sort of seems like everybody is having a good time. In reality, of course, this is a really dangerous practice. And there was a wonderful investigation in Bloomberg Businessweek by a reporter named Olivia Carville recently who went into the many lives that have been lost according to this challenge. And now some folks are starting to sue TikTok, saying the company should have done a better job removing those videos before they could be seen by kids who in many cases were under the age of 13. And kids are not supposed to be using social networks before they turn 13. GROSS: So what's the state of these lawsuits now? NEWTON: They are in process. I think it's relatively early. And, you know, this will be one where the platform will say, because of Section 230, you can't sue us for what was on our platform. And one of the reasons I have my eye on those cases is because of these other lawsuits that are before the Supreme Court that could potentially remove some of these protections from the platform. So, for example, if TikTok is found to have recommended videos to one of these, you know, poor kids who died doing this challenge, that could potentially become the basis for a lawsuit against TikTok that actually, you know, goes all the way to trial. GROSS: What's TikTok's approach to content moderation? NEWTON: TikTok moderates content quite aggressively, and I think it's probably fair to say that they moderate it more aggressively than any other platform. So one of the things that Bloomberg reported, which I hadn't known before, was that whenever a video on TikTok gets about 3,000 views, it gets sent to a human moderator who looks at it just to make sure that it is not too dangerous. Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, they're not doing that, right? You know, they have other moderation systems in place, but they're not getting eyes on every piece of content when it crosses that threshold of views. And I think one of the really tragic things about this story is that even when you're doing that, you're still missing videos that may have under 3,000 views that, for whatever reason, are still getting recommended to these kids. And I think it just goes to show that when you run a global-scale social network, there are just going to be harms associated with this. And we need to keep thinking through how we can do a better job preventing that really harmful stuff from reaching vulnerable kids. GROSS: Since we spent a lot of time talking about Twitter, what do you want from social media now in 2022, going on 2023? And how different is that from what you wanted when you first started using Twitter and Facebook? NEWTON: You know, I love that question because it took me such a long time to figure out what my answer to it was. I think what I've decided is that I want the internet to be as good for everyone else as it has been for me. You know, the internet is a place where I have learned to make friends. It's where I've been able to express myself. I was able to build something of a following. And I was able to turn that into a business which has now given me this wonderful life. And it's all because of the way that these social networks can connect us to audiences that are like-minded, who think that we're interesting. And in order for that to happen, those places need to be safe. They need to make me feel comfortable speaking. They need to get good at recommending me to people who might be interested in me, right? And so that's really what I want, right? I want all those systems and mechanisms in place so that if you're just kind of a good citizen of the world and you want to meet people who share your interests and maybe even want to make a little money on the internet, you should be able to find those people and you should be able to have those tools. I think 10 or 12 years ago, when I started using Twitter really intensely, I just thought of it as like kind of a fun thing, you know. I thought, well, you know, I'll paste a link here to something that I wrote and hopefully some people will read it. But over the past 10 years, we've seen how powerful it can be for good reasons as well as bad. And my hope is that, you know, as the world continues to evolve, we really keep pushing hard on those good uses of the internet because there are a lot of them. And while it's in the nature of us as journalists to focus on everything that's going wrong, in my everyday life, like, I live a way that it can go right. So that's how I think about that. GROSS: Casey Newton, it's been a pleasure to talk with you again. Thank you so much. NEWTON: Thanks so much for having me.

Ever since Elon Musk, the richest man in the world, bought Twitter for $44 billion in late April, Twitter has been in chaos. Musk has made and then withdrawn decisions including trying to retract his offer to buy Twitter. He's fired executives, cut the number of full-time employees in half, and then realized maybe he'd gone too far and tried to hire back some people he just terminated. He's floated ideas for subscription services and for charging a fee to verify that your account is really yours. But those ideas were met with widespread opposition. The number of content moderators has been slashed. Hate speech on Twitter has increased. Musk offered to reinstate Trump on Twitter after polling Twitter users about whether to do it. Some of the responders may have been bots. My guest, Casey Newton, says Musk has been remaking Twitter in his own image. Newton is an independent tech journalist who covers the intersection of technology and democracy for his newsletter, Platformer, which is hosted by Substack. He also co-hosts the tech podcast \"Hard Fork\" with New York Times tech journalist Kevin Roose. From 2013 until 2020, when Newton started Platformer, he reported on tech for The Verge. We recorded our interview yesterday. Casey Newton, welcome back to FRESH AIR. SpaceX and Tesla have been considered such big success stories, and credit has gone to Elon Musk. Twitter is showing a different side of him - indecisive, making decisions then retracting them. Twitter is losing money and advertisers under his leadership. He's making decisions that are driving away Twitter users. Are you surprised by what kind of leader he's turned out to be as the owner of Twitter? CASEY NEWTON: You know, I really am. I had not paid a lot of attention to what Musk was doing at Tesla and SpaceX, but as you note, he was having a lot of success with those companies. And the Twitter that he inherited, while it had its challenges, was not a company in crisis. It made about $5 billion last year, has hundreds of millions of active users. And while it clearly needed to evolve, there was sort of no pressing need to blow it up and start over. And yet from the moment that he stepped into that job, that seems to be exactly what he decided to do. He has now eliminated close to three-quarters of the staff. He has implemented a bunch of ideas and then quickly reversed himself. And more than anything else, I think he's given the impression that rather than operating according to some set plan, he's really managing Twitter more by whims and what seems to him to be a good idea in the moment. And so that's led to a lot of chaos. GROSS: Do you think Twitter is starting to reflect Elon Musk's politics? And what are his politics? NEWTON: Well, I think that in a lot of ways, he is a fairly conventional conservative. You know, he has adopted a lot of the views that have become mainstream among Republicans such as that social networks are censoring too much content, that free speech is at risk, that there are sort of too much deference shown to people who say that they're experiencing harassment or abuse or hate speech. And he wants to end those practices. So, you know, one of his first moves was to restore more than 60,000 accounts of people who had been banned from Twitter for breaking its rules. And I think that's sort of very much in keeping with this conservative world view, that it should not be up to platforms to decide who can participate or sort of set the terms by which they might participate. Another way that we've seen Elon Musk's more conservative views manifest is he has lately been having a lot of fun with what he's calling the Twitter files. The Twitter files had to do with a New York Post story from the 2020 election about Hunter Biden's laptop. Twitter and Facebook intervened to temporarily restrict the distribution of that story because it looked like it was part of a sort of hack-and-leak-propaganda operation, which they were on high alert for. And they worried that somebody might be interfering with the election. Well, fast forward to today, and now a lot of Republicans believe that the platforms themselves interfered in the election by not allowing that story to spread quite as rapidly as it might have otherwise. This is something that Elon Musk clearly believes, and he has now been releasing a bunch of internal documents. He shared them with a couple of other journalists, who have been posting about them on Twitter. And this is essentially red meat for the Republican base. You know, I would not be surprised if we saw hearings about this in the House of Representatives next year, right? So all these things are just sort of, you know, Elon being a good conservative and riling up that base. And he has spent a lot of time since he took over Twitter doing just that. GROSS: So in terms of whether Twitter may now be reflecting Elon Musk's politics, Musk re-platformed over 60,000 people including Donald Trump, who used Twitter to, you know, say mistruths, disinformation. This is a person who wants to cancel part of the Constitution and who also was responsible for a lot of hate speech on Twitter. And then, you know, Musk re-platformed Kanye West in spite of Kanye West's antisemitism and then canceled the re-platforming in another kind of sudden change of mind. And of the 64,000 people or so that Elon Musk brought back to Twitter, people who had been canceled because of violations of Twitter rules including hate speech - you know, why would he want to bring back people who were responsible for hate speech? Hate speech is dangerous. It can really physically harm people. So how does that reflect, if at all, Musk's politics? NEWTON: So what he has said about his view on this subject is that he believes that as long as you have not broken the law, you should effectively have unfettered access to social platforms, that - and this is just sort of a very glib understanding of free speech, I would say, where if you - you should just sort of have the right to speech, and almost nothing can take that away. And, you know, here in the United States, there's all sorts of horrible things that you can say. And under the First Amendment, you can't be prosecuted for those. Musk essentially wants to bring that idea to this platform that he now owns. But I think it's worth talking a bit about why that isn't an approach taken by any other platform. And it's because most of us just don't want to be in rooms, whether they're real rooms or virtual rooms, with people who are preaching, you know, a gospel of hate, whether they're - you know, where they're spreading fictions or whether they're just sort of, you know, committing antisocial behavior. So there is this market. . . GROSS: Or harassing you. NEWTON: Yeah, exactly, right? If somebody's harassing you, you want to get out of there. And what I think that Musk and some of these other, like, right-wing platform commentators are missing is that there's a real market demand for this kind of basic content moderation, you know? And I just always sort of laugh because all of these guys - and it is mostly guys - think of themselves as the smartest business people in the entire world, and they can't believe that - you know, what all these woke liberals are doing to - you know, to these businesses. And yet I think we're going to see, over time, that they're going to turn out to be - they're going to lose a lot of money on these platforms 'cause they're not responding to what the market actually wants here, which is just basic content moderation. GROSS: Hate speech has increased since Musk took over. Are you seeing that? Are you seeing examples of that? NEWTON: We have seen some studies that have said that. I would say that some analysts who I really respect have questioned the methodology of those accounts. And so I'm not willing to say definitively that we've seen a massive rise in hate speech. However, the fact that they've restored thousands of accounts of people who did get kicked off for hate speech, that is very real. And so I think we have to assume that if hate speech hasn't increased on Twitter yet, it likely is going to happen in the coming weeks and months. GROSS: Do you think Elon Musk's public image has totally changed, that he's seen now as being more indecisive and incompetent? NEWTON: You know, I really do. And, you know, I should say, I am somebody who, in a lot of ways, was really rooting for Elon Musk here. Twitter has had a history of mismanagement. You know, two CEOs ago, it had a guy who was working two jobs at the same time. The company was really suffering as a result of that. And so I think, like a lot of people, I hoped that Elon, who had all this previous success, could come in and whatever the heck he was doing at Tesla and SpaceX maybe, you know, sprinkle a little bit of that magic on Twitter, and the platform will become a better version of itself. And yet, unfortunately, after he took over, he continuously rejected the advice of people who'd worked at Twitter for, you know, five, 10 years, who were able to predict for him exactly what was going to happen if he took the steps that he took. And he just kind of ignored those people and threw away their advice and fired them. And then he took these actions and then exactly what they predicted came true. And he found himself in a lot of trouble. And that's the main reason why I think that Elon's reputation has taken a hit. It's not so much that he made mistakes. Every CEO makes mistakes. It's that the effects of his actions were accurately predicted for him by his own employees, and he just ignored them every step of the way and has kind of continuously found himself in trouble. So I do think that that has changed the public conversation around what kind of leader he is. GROSS: You know, you reported - you've spoken to, you know, current and former Twitter employees and interviewed a Twitter engineer about his experiences working there and his experiences being laid off from there or terminated. And what you learned was that, you know, part of the engineering staff was asked to make, you know, a very technical presentation about how Twitter operates to Elon Musk. And they were kind of shocked about how little Musk really understood about the technical end of the operation. NEWTON: Yeah, that's right. You know, so something about Elon Musk is that he sort of worships at the altar of the engineer. And as soon as he took over Twitter, basically job one for him was to bring in a bunch of his engineers from Tesla and some of his other companies to try to figure out who's a good engineer at Twitter. And more recently, they've started to do these impromptu code reviews, they call them, where they sort of summon you to an office. And they say, you know, show me every line of code you've written over the past week. So he really styles himself as this very technical person. And yet, as you note, we have talked with folks who have said that, indeed, when they go to show him that code, he isn't really understanding what they're saying. Now, that's not true in every case, and I'm not saying that Elon Musk can't write a line of code. But for somebody who styles himself as this, you know, brilliant engineer, I have talked with Twitter employees who have been surprised at the lack of depth of his technical knowledge. GROSS: Well, let's take a short break here and then we'll talk some more. If you're just joining us, my guest is Casey Newton, who writes about tech for his newsletter Platformer, which is hosted by Substack. We'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF SLOWBERN'S \"WHEN WAR WAS KING\") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to my interview with Casey Newton, who writes about the intersection of technology and democracy for his newsletter, Platformer, which is hosted by Substack. He's been reporting on the chaos at Twitter ever since Elon Musk bought it for $44 billion in late October. What's left of Twitter's staff? I think he fired about 20% of his full-time staff and 80% of contractors? NEWTON: The numbers were even higher than that. And it's happened in several rounds, so it's sort of hard to keep up. There was an initial cut of about 50% to the core full-time employees. Then, as you note, about 80% of contractors got let go. Then he sent out an email to everyone saying, hey, you know, things - life is about to get even more difficult around here and you need to be extremely hardcore if you want to stay. And if you want to stay, like, click this button. Well, after that, a lot of people chose to take a severance package instead. So we now believe that Twitter has around 2,000 employees or fewer, and that's down from about 8,000 when he took over. GROSS: Well, you know, the first time you were on our show, you were talking about content moderators on Facebook and how many of them get PTSD because they're - these are the people who have to look at all the, like, beheading videos and the murder videos and all the most horrible videos that Facebook would be taking down 'cause they're making the decision about whether to take these down or not. And so, you know, it sounded like a really stressful job. What's left of content moderators now on Twitter? Because on the one hand, tens of thousands of Twitter users who were de-platformed, who were taken down from Twitter, have been reinstated by Musk. And, you know, a certain percentage of them - I don't know what percentage - were taken down because of hate speech, because of behavior that wasn't tolerated on Twitter. So you're adding people who are responsible for hate speech and you're firing people who are content moderators. So what's left of the content moderation crew? NEWTON: So, you know, Twitter will not tell us how many content moderators it has left. The company no longer has a communications department. So, you know, we're - we reporters are all used to just, you know, emailing our friends over in PR. And with Twitter, that's no longer possible. So we don't have a good answer to that question. What we - you know, what I've reported and have come to understand is that the vast majority of the content moderators have been let go. And I have friends and sources who work in a field that they call trust and safety, and they're basically the people who work at these companies to try to keep the platforms safe. And they've been pointing out to me, like, look, if you search for this hashtag, which, you know, used to sort of be blocked on Twitter, didn't used to return very many results, it's now starting to show some really problematic stuff. So there is absolutely concern that Twitter is filling up with the sort of stuff that content moderators would have been able to eliminate if they were still around. You know, at the same time, Twitter's, like, rules - you know, every platform sets rules for what you can and can't do on the platform. Like, those haven't changed at all. If you, you know, Google the Twitter community standards, you'll find them, that there have been no changes since Musk took over. And yet, as you note, he just restored, you know, a bunch of, you know, neo-Nazis and other people to the platform. So, like, what are the rules on Twitter? You know, who knows? We really are just in a moment of pure chaos. GROSS: You know, you describe what's happened at Twitter to employees as a purge. An engineer who you - a Twitter engineer who you interviewed was fired and got this email. We regret to inform you that your employment is terminated effective immediately. Your recent behavior has violated company policy. What was the violation? NEWTON: Well, this person didn't know because it wasn't clear what policy they were referring to. You know, one of the waves of people being let go happened as Elon and his associates noticed that Twitter workers were being somewhat critical of his behavior, both in the company's Slack channels and sometimes even publicly on Twitter. And they just started to get rid of those people. And they would just say, well, you know, you violated company policy. And, you know, the sources I spoke with sort of were throwing up their hands and saying, what policy are you talking about? You know, at Twitter - some people hear that and they say, well, look, if you were making fun of the boss, of course you got fired. That would happen anywhere. And that's, you know, true as far as it goes. But at Twitter, they had this culture of always criticizing power. You know, they believed that it sort of made the company stronger if they could question decisions being made by their leaders in public. And so this really did come as a huge shock to them. And I actually think some of them are probably going to sue the company over it because they feel like it was a wrongful termination. GROSS: Musk became obsessed with the idea that his employees might sabotage Twitter. Is that a sign - do you think that's a sign of paranoia or a legitimate concern? NEWTON: I think it was mostly paranoia. You know, most of the folks who I've been speaking with at Twitter over the past couple of months cared about the service a lot. And, in fact, the reason why they were staying on in spite of a lot of chaos all around them was because they wanted the Twitter service to stay up. They believed in it. But Musk really - particularly, I think, as he started to see criticisms of himself and his associates and Slack and on Twitter, he really did start to believe some of these people are going to go rogue and somehow sabotage the site. And so he undertook a purge. GROSS: Are there employees who think that Musk is sabotaging Twitter in his attempt to blow it up? NEWTON: There are. GROSS: And remake it, you know, and remake it his way? Yeah. NEWTON: Well, I think - the employees I've spoken to believe that the motivation is likely more financial. You know, as you'll recall, he spent $44 billion on Twitter. Almost everyone agrees that that was way more than the service was worth. The price crashed basically as soon as he bought it in the public stock markets, along with all the other tech stocks. And so now the company is loaded up with about $13 billion in debt. It has to pay a billion dollars a year just in interest to service that debt. And some folks believe that what Elon really wants to do is just blow the whole thing up so that he can restructure that debt and make Twitter cheaper after all. I will say I don't really buy that. I don't think that there is a master plan. I think Elon's waking up every day and just deciding what seems like the best thing to do that day, and that he's not trying to sabotage the site. But is it an idea out there that's going around among employees? It is. GROSS: So one of the changes that Musk told employees he was making was that they could no longer work remotely, that they had to come into the office. And I think a lot of employees were upset by that, particularly ones who might have, you know, taken the job with the understanding that they could stay at home and take care of, you know, children or parents or grandparents or whatever their reason was to want to work at home and that suddenly the ground rules were being changed. Now, a lot of offices changed their ground rules about working from home. But how did that go over at Twitter? And how did Musk respond to the negative reaction? NEWTON: Well, you know, as you can imagine, this is an extraordinarily disruptive thing for people who had taken these jobs assuming that they would be able to work where ever they wanted to. So a lot of folks don't work near one of the Twitter offices. And they received an email that said essentially, within a day, you need to be able to report to Twitter headquarters. And unless you have either a really good reason or you are an exceptional talent, we're not going to let you work remotely. And, of course, you know, how do you define an exceptional talent? There was sort of no further information on who might qualify under that plan. And so people did start to make other plans. You know, that that was sort of a big reason why some people quit the company because ultimately they just decided, you know, this wasn't worth uprooting their entire lives for. For other people, though, I think it will probably be the basis of some sort of lawsuit because they will say, look, you know, you can't sort of unilaterally tell me that I just have to show up, you know, after hiring me to do this job that you told me that I could do remotely. So that's kind of how it played out among employees. You know, for Elon, I think his perspective is anything he does that leads an unhappy person to quit is good. Like, right now, he's in a mode of trying to figure out who is loyal to him at Twitter and who he can sort of count on to be a good engineer. And everything else is just kind of noise and he doesn't really worry about it. GROSS: Well, let's take another break here. If you're just joining us, my guest is Casey Newton, who reports on tech issues for his newsletter Platformer, which is hosted on Substack. We'll talk more about the chaos at Twitter ever since Elon Musk took over in late October after a break. I'm Terry Gross, And this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MISHA MENGELBERG TRIO'S \"A BIT NERVOUS\") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Let's get back to the interview I recorded yesterday with Casey Newton, who writes about the intersection of technology and democracy for his newsletter, Platformer, which is hosted by Substack. He also co-hosts the tech podcast \"Hard Fork\" with New York Times reporter Kevin Roose. Newton has been writing about the changes and the chaos at Twitter since Elon Musk bought it for $44 billion in late October. So is part of Elon Musk's goal in slashing the staff at Twitter by about 50% for full-time employees as part of the goal to, like, cut costs? NEWTON: Yes, it is. He spent a lot of money on Twitter, and he needs to figure out how to make the site profitable. You know, for most of its history, Twitter has not been a profitable company, and it arguably had hired too many people. You know, I think even if Elon Musk had not taken over the company, Twitter probably would have undergone some pretty significant layoffs this year. I think it probably would have been closer to 25%. But as he tries to figure out what the next incarnation of Twitter should be, he wants to really get rid of a lot of employees because that's his single biggest cost. GROSS: Musk said that the financial situation at Twitter was dire, and the company could even go bankrupt. What's the upside of saying that publicly? NEWTON: (Laughter) You know, I wish I knew. I have since learned that he apparently has said a version of this at some of his other companies as well. He seems to like leaning on the drama of that a little bit to rally the troops. That's not how I would rally the troops. But I think he wants to sort of inspire in employees a sense of fear that unless they work really hard and do their best, the company and then their job might go away. But I also think it gives him cover to do a lot of the things that we've seen, right? - getting rid of absolutely huge numbers of people, sometimes without even fully understanding what they did to the point that you have to go beg them to come back after you've gotten rid of them, right? But if you tell people, like, hey, we might go bankrupt, all of a sudden, a lot of options are on the table that might otherwise not be. GROSS: One of Musk's strategies that seems to have backfired is dealing with verification. Can you describe what verification is and what Twitter's policy had been before Musk took over? NEWTON: Yeah. So Twitter started a verification policy in 2009, and the basic idea was that it needed a way to verify that the owner of an account was who they said it was. So if you were a politician, a journalist or a celebrity, if you were really that person, Twitter would verify that, and then you would get this little blue check mark on your profile. That's how it had always worked. Musk came along and said he wanted verification to be open to a much wider number of people, which, by the way, I thought was a pretty good idea. I think there are a lot of good reasons why you might want people to be able to optionally verify their identity on Twitter. It can just sort of be good for the service overall. But he made one really bad decision, which was that not only did he offer everyone a verification badge, it was no longer actually connected to any sort of idea of verification. All you needed to do was pay $8. You could create any account; you would get that little badge. And so people started to pretend to be brands. They started to be celebrities. They started to pretend to be Elon Musk. And that same blue verification badge that had only ever meant you are who you say you are all of a sudden now meant I have $8. GROSS: (Laughter). NEWTON: And so there was two days of just absolute chaos on Twitter as people sort of raced to see how much fun they could have with this ridiculous new system, wherefore, predictably, he pulled the plug and said they would start over. GROSS: And one of the consequences of that was that he lost a lot of advertisers. Can you explain why? NEWTON: Yeah. So advertisers are obsessed with what they call brand safety, which is basically just the idea that any of their ads are not going to appear next to something horrible, but also that they counted on verification to let people know that their brand was what it said it was. So, you know, one of the most famous examples from this disaster is that someone created a fake account pretending to be Eli Lilly and then saying, insulin is free. And then, the real Eli Lilly had to come along and say, oh, no, no, we're still going to, you know, massively overcharge you for insulin. So in the wake of this, you have a lot of advertisers saying, you know what? Why are we spending money to be here? No one is even going to be able to tell if our brand is the real brand. And so you start to see this huge pullback in advertising as people just decide, you know what? We're going to sit this out for a while, while we wait to see what Elon is going to do. GROSS: Twitter's largest brand advertiser is, or was, Apple. Apple pulled their advertising. Has Apple come back? NEWTON: Yes. So there was a summit between Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple, and Elon Musk a couple of days after Elon had started what seemed like a pretty unwise war against the company. And Elon Musk has since tweeted that Apple has resumed its advertising as normal. It's really important for Twitter. Apple is its single largest brand advertiser, so losing them would have been really hard on Twitter. It seems, for now, like that has been put to rest. GROSS: Musk recently tweeted his thanks to returning advertisers. How many returned? And why did they return? NEWTON: I'm still trying to learn the answer to this question. I don't understand what has happened on Twitter in the past two weeks that would make any advertiser say now it feels safe. You still have all of these, you know, accounts that have been brought back from the dead to say terrible things. You still do not have a clear answer on what their verification program is going to look like going forward. And so I don't really understand why these folks have come back. And I don't understand how many have come back. You know, as I've been reporting on this, you know, my understanding is that Twitter's ad sales are still down from where they were expected to be. We're in the middle of what should be their busiest season. Not only is it the holidays, but the World Cup is traditionally one of the busiest times on Twitter, you know, every four years. And I think the advertisers are still down. So there are still some things I don't know there. But I would honestly be shocked if, you know, two months from now, Twitter's ad business was looking robust. GROSS: Well, let's take another break here. If you're just joining us, my guest is Casey Newton, who writes about tech for his newsletter, Platformer, which is hosted by Substack. We'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF AMY RIGBY SONG, \"PLAYING PITTSBURGH\") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to my interview with Casey Newton, who writes about the intersection of technology and democracy for his newsletter, Platformer. He's been reporting on the chaos at Twitter ever since Elon Musk bought it in late October. So getting back to the idea that Musk is kind of blowing up Twitter to remake it his way, he's losing so much money in the process. I mean, other ways that he's losing money - 'cause you've pointed this out - is re-platforming people and making all these changes. They're really expensive. It requires a lot of engineering changes in order to make these changes on Twitter. Plus, there's no longer as many engineers there now. So it's almost like he's sabotaging himself in trying to remake Twitter. NEWTON: Yeah, I think, you know, for some leaders, it's not a good idea unless they came up with it, right? And so people who worked at Twitter had all sorts of ideas about how you could improve the service, make it more profitable. Elon has gotten rid of most of those people, and he's fixated on a few core ideas that he thinks are going to be spectacular. Subscriptions is probably the biggest one although there are others. And he's just going to go for it. You know, this is probably one of the most self-confident people in the entire world, right? Elon Musk does not have impostor syndrome. He wakes up every day convinced that he is the only person who knows how to fix this company. And, you know, as me - for me, an observer, I just sort of sit back and think, like, none of this is working, you know? And so to me, the question is, will he ever acknowledge that other people have better ideas for this company than he does? Or will he just sort of continue to charge ahead with his own ideas, you know, regardless of if they're successful or not? GROSS: I'm wondering, like, did he ever announce projects and then, like, halt them or withdraw them at SpaceX or Tesla? Did he have a reputation for doing that there? NEWTON: Yeah, I mean, sort of the most famous one at Tesla is - Tesla has some autonomous driving capabilities. Elon calls it full self-driving even though, you know, automotive experts, I think, quibble with whether it is actually full self-driving. But the rollout has just been delayed and delayed and delayed and delayed. And, you know, now, you know, who knows sort of when it will ever come. So, yeah, there is definitely a history of these companies and making grandiose promises and then not following up, right? You might also remember the Cybertruck, a big, flashy truck that he announced and, you know, began taking preorders for. You know, my understanding is the Cybertruck has still not shipped. So there's a lot of announcing and then delaying in Elon's world. GROSS: You know, you also write that some CEOs are actually rooting for Musk. Why? NEWTON: Well, you know, during the last decade, tech workers gained a lot of power, right? As the industry grew, engineers were in short supply, highly in demand, became very well compensated. And in order to compete for them, companies would offer them all these famous perks, right? - so, you know, on-site daycare and laundry and we'll send a barber to your office, right? And that was really great for the tech workers. And the tech workers went a step further, and they started talking about issues like, you know, this company isn't really very diverse; we should try to make it more diverse. Or, you know, it seems like our company has a lot of dealings with the Chinese government; that makes us uncomfortable, right? So you saw walkouts. You saw worker organizing. And for the tech workers, I think that was a really positive thing. But there's this whole class of CEOs who regards that as a terrible mistake. And I think what you see in a lot of the CEOs rooting for Elon, which they're doing mostly quietly and behind the scenes, is they love the idea of a CEO who can begin to claw back some of that power - right? - someone who can put workers in what they see as their proper place, which is sort of silently working away for whatever the boss wants and no longer bringing up issues like diversity, equity and inclusion, complaining that they're not getting enough perks, right? This really is, I believe, about clawing back some of those gains that workers have made over the past 10 years and restoring this sort of more traditional everybody-just-do-what-the-boss-says kind of work experience. GROSS: You're still on Twitter, and you cover tech including Twitter. You have every reason to be on Twitter. So beyond your work as a journalist, why do you feel like you need Twitter? NEWTON: You know, Twitter is really the only social network I ever felt like I was good at. You know, I think I'm not pretty enough for Instagram. I'm not a good enough dancer for TikTok. GROSS: (Laughter). NEWTON: Like, I work in text, and Twitter has just always been a great place for people who like to write sentences. I've often thought that it's the funniest social network. You know, people just wake up every day, and they just tell jokes on Twitter in a way that makes me laugh, right? It's like you don't often laugh intentionally when you go on LinkedIn. So I've just always loved that about Twitter. And I hope that, you know, if Twitter doesn't survive all of this, that there is still something Twitter-like in the world for those of us who like to write and read sentences. GROSS: Do you think there's a chance that Twitter won't survive? NEWTON: You know, I try not to be too excitable on this point 'cause on one hand, I look at everything that's happened, and I think, well, how could it survive? (Laughter) Like, none of this seems like this is sustainable to me, you know? But at the same time, you know, Yahoo still exists. There are all sorts of websites from, you know, even the dot-com era that are still around in one form or another. So I think that Twitter will probably still be around in some form for some time to come. However, I also think that there's probably never been a better time to start a Twitter competitor. I do think that there is an opportunity for folks to understand what is powerful about Twitter to come in, rebuild it, probably change some things, probably not make it exactly like Twitter, but just sort of do it in a sort of straightforward, normal, less chaotic way than Musk is doing. And I think they might find some success. So that's sort of one of the big things I'm looking for in 2023, is who seizes opportunity and how well do they do? GROSS: You've also been writing about two cases that the Supreme Court will decide next year that you say could make life more difficult for tech platforms without doing much to address the harm that those platforms create. And this has to do with people who are suing platforms for saying that the platforms and what they posted encouraged terrorism and may have helped lead to terrorist attacks. In one case, the plaintiff's family member was killed in an ISIS attack. So tell us what the basic premise of these lawsuits are. NEWTON: Yeah. So you know, in the United States, we have this important law, Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. And it protects platforms from liability, in most cases, from what their users post. So even if you post something really terrible on a platform, generally speaking, you cannot sue a platform over that. What makes these cases interesting, particularly one of them, the Gonzalez case, is that the Gonzalez case is the first time the Supreme Court has agreed to take a case that could limit Section 230. And specifically, what the Gonzalez case is saying is that Google and YouTube should be held accountable for the videos that it recommended to people about ISIS and sort of recruiting people to ISIS. So why is that a big deal? Well, YouTube recommends millions and millions, if not billions, of videos to people. And if it is going to be legally liable for every video that it promotes, that is going to be terrifying to the company because much of the modern internet, most of the platforms that we use, are all built on things being recommended to us. And platforms have never before had to worry that what they recommend could get them into legal trouble. GROSS: So I guess the question is a recommendation free speech? Is it a free speech issue? NEWTON: Yeah. And, you know, I have spoken with First Amendment scholars who believe that recommendations are absolutely speech, and that it goes against our understanding of the First Amendment to suggest that a corporation could not say, watch this video, because in a lot of ways, that doesn't seem very different from a publisher of a newspaper telling you to read this article, right? But at the same time, we know that there are voices on the Supreme Court, led by Clarence Thomas, who have argued that Section 230 gives platforms too much protection and that it's time to start clawing some of those protections back. So scholars are really watching this case because there's not - we just really don't know how this one is going to go. GROSS: If the plaintiffs win and platforms like Google and YouTube are held responsible for recommending videos or text, that would be in conflict with laws in Florida and Texas that prevents social media platforms from taking down posts because of content. Can you explain the predicament that platforms would be in if the plaintiffs win the Supreme Court cases but a case comes up in Florida or Texas (laughter)? NEWTON: Yeah. And so these Florida and Texas laws that were passed this year essentially seek to make content moderation illegal. And this is very much in the Elon Musk school of thinking - right? - which is that we should just sort of have free speech and nothing else. And so, as you know, we could be in this world where platforms will be forced to carry speech, including hate speech, in places like Texas and Florida because it will be illegal to remove speech. But then if they recommend that speech via some sort of algorithm, they could also then be held legally liable for recommending that thing, which they are forced to carry and are not allowed to remove. So you know, I talked to the people who work on this stuff at platforms. And they have no idea how they would comply with these laws. They're completely at a loss. GROSS: Well, let's take another break here. If you're just joining us, my guest is Casey Newton, who writes about tech for his newsletter, Platform. We'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF BEASTIE BOYS SONG, \"NAMASTE\") GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to my interview with Casey Newton, who writes about the intersection of technology and democracy for his newsletter, Platformer, which is hosted by Substack. He's been reporting on the chaos at Twitter ever since Elon Musk bought it in late October. A related issue to the issue we've been talking about - about the responsibility of social media to have content moderation - TikTok is facing lawsuits about things like the blackout challenge. Would you describe what the blackout challenge is and what these lawsuits are saying? NEWTON: Yeah. So you know, this is a really dangerous stunt that's, you know, been around since I was a kid where kids will encourage one another to sort of use household objects to choke themselves unconscious, to then experience the adrenaline rush of suddenly regaining that consciousness. It has proven to be particularly dangerous on TikTok, in part, I think, just because it looks fun, you know? Kids see kids doing this. Of course, in the videos, everyone comes right back awake. And they are laughing and giggling. And you look over, you know, on the right side of the screen and that video's getting lots of likes. And it just sort of seems like everybody is having a good time. In reality, of course, this is a really dangerous practice. And there was a wonderful investigation in Bloomberg Businessweek by a reporter named Olivia Carville recently who went into the many lives that have been lost according to this challenge. And now some folks are starting to sue TikTok, saying the company should have done a better job removing those videos before they could be seen by kids who in many cases were under the age of 13. And kids are not supposed to be using social networks before they turn 13. GROSS: So what's the state of these lawsuits now? NEWTON: They are in process. I think it's relatively early. And, you know, this will be one where the platform will say, because of Section 230, you can't sue us for what was on our platform. And one of the reasons I have my eye on those cases is because of these other lawsuits that are before the Supreme Court that could potentially remove some of these protections from the platform. So, for example, if TikTok is found to have recommended videos to one of these, you know, poor kids who died doing this challenge, that could potentially become the basis for a lawsuit against TikTok that actually, you know, goes all the way to trial. GROSS: What's TikTok's approach to content moderation? NEWTON: TikTok moderates content quite aggressively, and I think it's probably fair to say that they moderate it more aggressively than any other platform. So one of the things that Bloomberg reported, which I hadn't known before, was that whenever a video on TikTok gets about 3,000 views, it gets sent to a human moderator who looks at it just to make sure that it is not too dangerous. Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, they're not doing that, right? You know, they have other moderation systems in place, but they're not getting eyes on every piece of content when it crosses that threshold of views. And I think one of the really tragic things about this story is that even when you're doing that, you're still missing videos that may have under 3,000 views that, for whatever reason, are still getting recommended to these kids. And I think it just goes to show that when you run a global-scale social network, there are just going to be harms associated with this. And we need to keep thinking through how we can do a better job preventing that really harmful stuff from reaching vulnerable kids. GROSS: Since we spent a lot of time talking about Twitter, what do you want from social media now in 2022, going on 2023? And how different is that from what you wanted when you first started using Twitter and Facebook? NEWTON: You know, I love that question because it took me such a long time to figure out what my answer to it was. I think what I've decided is that I want the internet to be as good for everyone else as it has been for me. You know, the internet is a place where I have learned to make friends. It's where I've been able to express myself. I was able to build something of a following. And I was able to turn that into a business which has now given me this wonderful life. And it's all because of the way that these social networks can connect us to audiences that are like-minded, who think that we're interesting. And in order for that to happen, those places need to be safe. They need to make me feel comfortable speaking. They need to get good at recommending me to people who might be interested in me, right? And so that's really what I want, right? I want all those systems and mechanisms in place so that if you're just kind of a good citizen of the world and you want to meet people who share your interests and maybe even want to make a little money on the internet, you should be able to find those people and you should be able to have those tools. I think 10 or 12 years ago, when I started using Twitter really intensely, I just thought of it as like kind of a fun thing, you know. I thought, well, you know, I'll paste a link here to something that I wrote and hopefully some people will read it. But over the past 10 years, we've seen how powerful it can be for good reasons as well as bad. And my hope is that, you know, as the world continues to evolve, we really keep pushing hard on those good uses of the internet because there are a lot of them. And while it's in the nature of us as journalists to focus on everything that's going wrong, in my everyday life, like, I live a way that it can go right. So that's how I think about that. GROSS: Casey Newton, it's been a pleasure to talk with you again. Thank you so much. NEWTON: Thanks so much for having me.

How our faces are captured, where that data ends up and who has access to it. Do you use Instagram? Do you let Google Maps track you? Do you, I don't know, let - open your iPhone with your face? (Laughter). ALISON KILLING: Oh, God. So I'm pretty privacy conscious, as you might imagine. I don't allow Google to store my location. I don't have the face unlock turned on on my phone. And that is in part because I'm just aware of, like, how sensitive the data is. And I feel so self-conscious about it. ZOMORODI: This is Alison Killing. She's a journalist who, ironically, uses all sorts of data that's available online to track the actions of authoritarian governments. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)KILLING: So all of the digital traces that we leave behind on the internet, like, how can we use those to investigate? And I mostly focus on human rights. ZOMORODI: In 2021, Alison won the Pulitzer Prize for her investigations into China, a place where people's faces and movements are constantly being watched. KILLING: They've really worked to sort of cover cities in a way that they are able to obtain as much data as possible. So placing cameras in high-traffic areas. So, for example, at the entrance to a neighborhood where they can then say, OK, we know everybody who is in this neighborhood now. We know whether they're in or when they've left. ZOMORODI: China has the world's largest surveillance network, and cameras watch over residential complexes, office buildings, train stations, shopping malls. KILLING: So these are very high - traffic places where they can then say like, OK, these are the people who are in this area so that they can then control that area. They're collecting a lot of data and there's huge ambition about the things that they would like to do with it. A lot of work has gone into the processing tools at the back end of this software to identify people by gender and age and then controversially also by ethnicity. ZOMORODI: And as you may know, the Chinese government has been tracking one large group of people, in particular, the Uyghurs, a Muslim ethnic minority in a western region called Xinjiang. KILLING: Yeah. There's been a lot of discrimination. There's been intermittent crackdowns on the practice of Islam. But then in 2009, there were two Uyghur workers killed, and that led to protests which turned violent. And about 200 people were killed. And this was kind of the start as well of the Chinese authorities starting to crack down on the region and seeing it as a very violent place, seeing it as a site of terrorism. ZOMORODI: The incident ushered in an era of Chinese control of the Uyghurs using all kinds of tactics. KILLING: So I think from sort of 2013, 2014, we saw the start of this real campaign of oppression in Xinjiang with the installation of this incredibly invasive surveillance state. And The New York Times has done a lot of investigation on this topic where they actually found documents from tech companies which were boasting that they could identify Uyghurs using facial recognition software. So one of the first things that we saw was the creation of these - this network of detention camps. ZOMORODI: You know, Alison, we were just talking to Parmy Olson - she's a tech reporter - about how people view facial recognition in the Western world. And it always - it often feels like what-if scenarios. But here in China, we are talking about the worst-case scenario come true with proof that a minority are being tracked and rounded up because you could see the camps on satellite imagery. KILLING: Yeah. In the satellite imagery, we saw them starting to appear in late 2016. And these stories started to emerge that hundreds of thousands of people have been disappeared into these camps. And, you know, nobody knew where they were. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #1: In the far west of China, evidence is building that a monstrous crime is taking place. UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #2: An estimated 1 million Chinese Muslims have vanished. UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #3: Uyghurs are now being rounded up by the hundreds of thousands. UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #4: There are many accounts of people who have had their relatives disappear into the camps. And we don't really know what's happening to them. ZOMORODI: Alison Killing picks up the story from the TEDx stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)KILLING: I got involved in investigating Xinjiang in the summer of 2018, when I met Megha Rajagopalan, an American journalist who had been working in China for several years. Over the past few years, China has been carrying out a campaign of forcible assimilation and several nations have described it as a genocide. It's estimated that over a million people have been disappeared into detention camps. And while the Chinese government claims that these are part of a benign program of reeducation, dozens of former detainees describe being tortured and abused and women being forcibly sterilized. And yet, for a long time, we lacked information about what was happening in Xinjiang because the Chinese government controls the internet tightly and restricts journalists' work in the region. Journalists would be followed or detained. And the authorities occasionally even went so far as to set up fake roadworks or staged car crashes to prevent access to certain roads. Local people who did speak to journalists faced the risk of being sent to a detention camp for doing so. Megha had been the first journalist to visit one of the camps. But shortly after publishing her article, the Chinese authorities declined to renew her visa, and she had to leave. Other journalists had managed to visit a handful of the camps, but this still represented a fraction of what we believed was out there, and no one knew where the others were. But Megha was keen to find the rest. She just needed to find a way to work effectively from outside China. ZOMORODI: And so this is where you come into the story, Alison, because you and Megha decided to team up. KILLING: Yeah. And so I met Megha at this workshop in the summer of 2018. I'd been doing a lot of cartography work and satellite imagery. And we got talking. And we realized that we maybe had a complementary skill set to be able to find these camps. You know, the way that Megha found this first camp was through satellite imagery. And so she had the idea that that could be a good way to find the rest. But it's still - like, Xinjiang is absolutely massive. So you can't just, like, scour all of the satellite imagery of the region. We needed to work out where to look. There was no street-level imagery, but as I zoomed in on the satellite images, this weird thing happened. A light gray square suddenly appeared above the location of the camp and then disappeared just as quickly as I zoomed in further. It was a bit like the map wasn't loading properly, but then I zoomed out and again only for the same thing to happen. I realized it couldn't be a problem with the map loading because the tiles would have been in the browser's cache. And when I found the same thing happening at the other locations we knew to be camps, I realized that we had a technique we could use to find the rest of the network. It's quite rare for maps and satellite images to have these blank spots because blank areas tend to draw attention to themselves. But here, we got lucky. Obscuring the camps had inadvertently revealed all of their locations. (LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE)KILLING: We worked with developer Christo Buschek, who specializes in documenting human rights issues and building tools for open-source researchers to map the masked tile locations. We had to work quickly and secretively to map the masked tiles before anyone found out what we were doing and removed them because our investigation relied on access to that information. The idea was that we could go and look at the masked tile locations and then look at that same image - at that same location in other, unaltered satellite imagery and see what was there. Zooming in on the satellite imagery, we can see the barbed wire in the courtyards that creates exercise pens for the detainees adjacent to the buildings. In other images, we can even see people, all wearing red uniforms, lined up in the courtyard. These features could help us decide whether a location was a camp or not. As we investigated further, we realized that the camps' program had evolved away from the early days of makeshift camps in former schools and hospitals and had become more permanent, that the camps were now larger, higher security and purpose-built. This is the largest camp that we know of. It's in Dabancheng. The complex is two miles long. And it would cover a quarter of New York's Central Park. In the satellite images, we can see the thick perimeter walls, the guard towers and these blue-roofed buildings, which we believe to be factories. We estimate that this complex can hold over 40,000 people without overcrowding. In total, we found 348 locations bearing the hallmarks of camps and prisons. And we believe that this is close to being the full network. We estimate that these facilities have been built to hold more than a million people. That's enough space to detain one in every 25 of Xinjiang's residents. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ZOMORODI: Wow. Your one little lucky revelation, finding that quirk on the digital map, led to a horrifying and huge discovery. And how did China respond to the allegations? KILLING: So at the beginning, when the rumors were first emerging of all of these people disappearing into camps, there was denial on the part of the Chinese government that this was happening. By mid-2018, the U. N. was - had made a statement about what was happening in Xinjiang and raising concerns and sort of saying it was one of the most urgent human rights crises in the world at that time. And the Chinese government was then under pressure to respond to that. And what they started to say was, like, well, you know, these places do exist. But they're education and vocational schools. People are there voluntarily. They're learning skills which will allow them to get higher-paid factory jobs. That wasn't true. People were taken there forcibly. In fact, the people who were initially targeted to be sent to the camps were the most highly educated people in those communities. So you know, the Chinese government's claims about these being vocational schools just weren't credible. ZOMORODI: So where do things stand now in terms of what you can do with this knowledge that you have accumulated other than share it with us? KILLING: Yeah. One of the big things that has been done - I mean, we've seen sanctions on key individuals within the Chinese Communist Party. We've also seen sanctions on goods coming out of Xinjiang. The Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act came into force earlier this year. And that bans any products coming out of Xinjiang because it's very, very likely that goods coming out of Xinjiang have involved forced labor. And it's very difficult to prove that they haven't. And so that is - has also been a big impact that we've seen. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)KILLING: With social media data and satellite imagery, we can provide evidence of human rights abuses in a way that wasn't possible before. We can move beyond looking at individual instances of human rights violations to show the scale of what's happened. We can corroborate the testimony of eyewitnesses and provide further proof of their stories. We can build a more detailed picture of what's happening to inform policymakers or to provide evidence that can be presented in court. With open-source data, we can provide the evidence needed for accountability and then, hopefully, action. Thank you. (APPLAUSE)ZOMORODI: That's Allison Killing. She's an investigative journalist and an architect. In 2021, she won the Pulitzer Prize for her reporting. You can see her full talk at ted. com(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ZOMORODI: Thank you so much for listening to our show this week, What's in a Face. This episode was produced by Andrea Gutierrez, James Delahoussaye and Katie Monteleone. It was edited by Sanaz Meshkinpour, James Delahoussaye, Rachel Faulkner White and me. Our production staff at NPR also includes Matthew Cloutier, Fiona Geiran and Katherine Sypher. Our theme music was written by Ramtin Arablouei. Our audio engineer was Kwesi Lee. Research support came from Zazil Davis-Vazquez. Our partners at TED are Chris Anderson, Colin Helms, Anna Phelan, Michelle Quint, Jimmy Gutierrez and Daniella Balarezo. I'm Manoush Zomorodi, and you've been listening to the TED Radio Hour from NPR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MANOUSH ZOMORODI, HOST:   On the show today - What's in a Face. How our faces are captured, where that data ends up and who has access to it. Do you use Instagram? Do you let Google Maps track you? Do you, I don't know, let - open your iPhone with your face? (Laughter). ALISON KILLING: Oh, God. So I'm pretty privacy conscious, as you might imagine. I don't allow Google to store my location. I don't have the face unlock turned on on my phone. And that is in part because I'm just aware of, like, how sensitive the data is. And I feel so self-conscious about it. ZOMORODI: This is Alison Killing. She's a journalist who, ironically, uses all sorts of data that's available online to track the actions of authoritarian governments. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) KILLING: So all of the digital traces that we leave behind on the internet, like, how can we use those to investigate? And I mostly focus on human rights. ZOMORODI: In 2021, Alison won the Pulitzer Prize for her investigations into China, a place where people's faces and movements are constantly being watched. KILLING: They've really worked to sort of cover cities in a way that they are able to obtain as much data as possible. So placing cameras in high-traffic areas. So, for example, at the entrance to a neighborhood where they can then say, OK, we know everybody who is in this neighborhood now. We know whether they're in or when they've left. ZOMORODI: China has the world's largest surveillance network, and cameras watch over residential complexes, office buildings, train stations, shopping malls. KILLING: So these are very high - traffic places where they can then say like, OK, these are the people who are in this area so that they can then control that area. They're collecting a lot of data and there's huge ambition about the things that they would like to do with it. A lot of work has gone into the processing tools at the back end of this software to identify people by gender and age and then controversially also by ethnicity. ZOMORODI: And as you may know, the Chinese government has been tracking one large group of people, in particular, the Uyghurs, a Muslim ethnic minority in a western region called Xinjiang. KILLING: Yeah. There's been a lot of discrimination. There's been intermittent crackdowns on the practice of Islam. But then in 2009, there were two Uyghur workers killed, and that led to protests which turned violent. And about 200 people were killed. And this was kind of the start as well of the Chinese authorities starting to crack down on the region and seeing it as a very violent place, seeing it as a site of terrorism. ZOMORODI: The incident ushered in an era of Chinese control of the Uyghurs using all kinds of tactics. KILLING: So I think from sort of 2013, 2014, we saw the start of this real campaign of oppression in Xinjiang with the installation of this incredibly invasive surveillance state. And The New York Times has done a lot of investigation on this topic where they actually found documents from tech companies which were boasting that they could identify Uyghurs using facial recognition software. So one of the first things that we saw was the creation of these - this network of detention camps.

Often, to understand how technology will change our lives, we just need to watch a movie, like this one released in 2021. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"THE CHAMPION\")UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #2: (As character, non-English language spoken). MIKE SEYMOUR: So \"The Champion\" was a film shot and made in Poland. So everyone's speaking, basically, Polish or German. ZOMORODI: This is Mike Seymour. He's a researcher at the University of Sydney and works in the film industry in special effects. SEYMOUR: And it's a great film. It's a true story about one of the first members of Auschwitz who was a boxer. Terribly moving story, but of course, only in Polish or German. ZOMORODI: And usually when there's a foreign film that wants to break into the English-speaking market, there are three options. SEYMOUR: Dubbing it, so we get somebody else to voice over a different piece of dialogue. But, of course, the lips aren't right, so it looks kind of odd. ZOMORODI: Or there's subtitles. SEYMOUR: Or we have the new version of what we call facial reenactment. ZOMORODI: Facial reenactment - it's a new technique that Mike and his team used on \"The Champion. \"SEYMOUR: We got involved as part of a team to convert the entire film to English. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"THE CHAMPION\")UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #3: (As character, non-English language spoken). SEYMOUR: So now if you were to watch the film in English, every actor speaks as if they'd been shot in English. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"THE CHAMPION\")UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #3: (As character) The Dutch king of Warsaw, totaling almost a hundred fights in bantam and featherweights. SEYMOUR: So we've replaced, effectively, the actors' faces with their own faces saying the lines in English. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"THE CHAMPION\")UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #4: (As character) He looks more like a small rooster plucked of its feathers than a champion. ZOMORODI: OK, so, Mike, when I watch this English version, it's seamless. It's like, their mouths, their faces, everything looks like it was originally shot this way, in English. Is this common in the industry? Is it normal? SEYMOUR: Well, it's the first time anyone's done it in the world, but hopefully it's going to become normal. In fact. . . ZOMORODI: As Mike went on to explain, months after filming, the actors rerecorded all their lines in English as cameras taped their voices and facial expressions. And then, through a process called neural rendering technology, their faces were replaced, so it looks like the film was just shot twice in two different languages. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"THE CHAMPION\")UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #4: (As Bruno) Come on, Teddy. Come on. ZOMORODI: The film industry is always pioneering new tech to trick our eye, to make someone or something look real. But over the last few years, Mike has been developing ways to use these techniques in our real lives. SEYMOUR: Yeah. Could we take this tech and just sort of use it outside the film industry? That fascinated me, where I say, well, hey, I don't want to get shaven and put on a suit for my important meeting today, so I'll just flip a switch and get digital makeup, and I'll look a whole lot better and a whole lot smarter. And I would be able to, say, speak in Korean when I absolutely can't speak in Korean. ZOMORODI: Yeah. SEYMOUR: And that, we hope, would facilitate much more genuine communications across cultural divides. ZOMORODI: Wow. You're saying that maybe one day, if - I have relatives all over the world who speak all different languages, but maybe one day we could do FaceTime, and it would sound as though I was speaking fluent Swedish, and they were speaking back to me - well, they can't speak English, but that we would hear each other's native tongue and wouldn't know the difference. It would look as though I could speak fluent Swedish, but they - it wouldn't look like I was not myself. SEYMOUR: Yes. There is a lot of modern technology that's very sophisticated that would, we think, benefit from being able to have an extra layer of communication that you get from face-to-face interaction. We're kind of this nexus point where that's possible. ZOMORODI: Mike Seymour picks up from the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SEYMOUR: We're interested in being able to see if we can put a face on technology because how would you react when a computer reacts to you with a smile? Would a 6-year-old learn math better if there was a 6-year-old teacher on the screen? What about if it was a slightly older version of herself? Would a grandparent having a cup of tea be more likely to check in with a computer system if they didn't have to log in and type - they could just talk to a virtual agent that actually was somebody from their past? This is what we're excited to explore with digital humans. Our ability to produce digital humans up until recently has been quite limited, but we're now seeing interactive digital humans starting to appear. The doors are opening. We are at an inflection point. We have this perfect storm of faster GPU graphics cards, new artificial intelligence deep-learning algorithms and great advances in game engines. It's an incredible combination of things coming together. This tremendous nexus of points is just providing us with an extraordinary opportunity of things that we can do. The important thing about this technology is that we can now use this to get these faces to work with us in real time. In other words - and this is a really key point - the faces that we're talking about can talk, interact and see us. ZOMORODI: OK, putting faces on our technology - tell me more about how you see this working and the reasons why we would want it. SEYMOUR: Yeah. I mean, there are a lot. Already in New Zealand, there is automatic sign languaging. So if somebody is speaking in digital human signs for the deaf community, you might have an assistant sitting in on a Zoom call that you can ask to help book future things, take notes, do stuff. In aged care, you could have an assistant that logs in with somebody each day and makes sure that they're OK and are lucid and they've taken their pills, not to replace a health care worker but just simply that - to make sure that they're OK and facilitate them staying in the home longer. And so in a world where we're saying, hey, you know, even to use the phone, there are no buttons now; you have to, you know, swipe up, swipe left, all this stuff. People are like, I have trouble with that. And so we could bring a face from their past that would be the one that they interact with that technology. ZOMORODI: You don't think that would be odd to someone? If you said, well, this is your sister. She's not actually your sister. She just kind of looks like your sister, and she's going to help you use your phone. That - I don't know. That might freak me out. SEYMOUR: Yeah. You know, you've just touched on a really interesting point. People, when asked, traditionally say, I wouldn't like that. So if you project ahead - you say, hey, would you have a digital human tell you what to do? They go, no, no, no, absolutely not. That would be freaky. And yet, every time we do a lab test, they completely don't do that. ZOMORODI: I looked up one of those services that might be available in the near future. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)SOUL: Hello. This is Soul, Dr. Beanie's assistant. TYLER: Hello, Soul, this is Tyler. I wanted to ask you about my recent surgery. ZOMORODI: In the demo video, a man is home after knee surgery and consults on his laptop with his AI nurse. Soul seemed to know her stuff. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)SOUL: The discharge summary states that you should take the pain medicine about 20 minutes before you put on your headset for your virtual reality meditation therapy. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ZOMORODI: Mike, I don't know. I have to be honest. I was a little unnerved by Soul. SEYMOUR: Sure. What I would say is it was her lack of authenticity that probably bothered you, not the digital representation of the face. Once you get to a certain level of quality, you kind of pass what we've referred to as the uncanny valley. So you now have got something that looks pretty darn good. It doesn't matter whether you can tell it's real or not. That's not the deciding factor. It's the authenticity of the emotional kind of response that matters, and that's the driving factor. And so for us to succeed in those cases, we really need to make sure that it's the - sort of the back end behind the face that's delivering what's wanted, not so much the face itself. ZOMORODI: Speaking of the uncanny valley, you did a demonstration on stage where you showed off a very realistic digital version of your head, your face, on a screen that you could control. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SEYMOUR: Hi, I'm Mike - well, kind of virtual Mike, really. This is our Digital Human Project, which is a collaboration of a whole bunch of people coming together to produce, well, a virtual human. And not only a virtual human. . . ZOMORODI: I mean, people, like, right now we can make digital avatars of ourselves, but not like this, not to this realistic extent. How hard was that to build? SEYMOUR: Yeah, I mean, we sort of are close. I mean, that one took a lot of people. So we scanned my face, and I got my face done in one of the most high-resolution facial-scanning systems in the world. It produced this super realistic version of my head. Then I could puppeteer that in real time or have it driven. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SEYMOUR: So how do we do it? So first, we scanned my face. This allowed us to produce a very complex digital avatar of my head, or a digital puppet. Then, with a camera mounted on a head rig, the computer can actually read my face. An advanced AI engine then basically interprets that into expressions. Now the computer can tell the digital puppet what to do. In effect, what's happening is it's the computer telling the muscles in the digital Mike how to smile, talk or do things. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ZOMORODI: It makes me wonder if we might get to a point where kids think, well, I would much rather deal with my extremely realistic-looking tutor on my laptop who responds to me but who doesn't actually give me a hard time and won't be offended if I tell it to shut up. What - how do we make sure that people don't choose these artificially intelligent agents over humans? SEYMOUR: Brilliant question, and I wish I had a definitive answer. I can only give you my hope. So imagine I'm a vet. I come back. But I'm an 18-year-old guy. I've experienced some horrendous experiences in a conflict, and I am now suffering from all sorts of sexual dysfunction. I cry at night. I have, like, things I'm really embarrassed about and ashamed of. I kind of want help, but I don't want to have to sit there and tell a doctor that. But I'd actually like my doctor to know all that so that they can help me. If there are ways where you can communicate that to, effectively, like, a digital nurse, a digital doctor substitute, so that the system can know it, but you don't have to face them and look them in the eye and say, you know, I have sexual dysfunction, but you can then get treatment and help, and the system knows and can look after you, that's a tremendous benefit. So hopefully for that generation, there will be tools that appear in their everyday life that just make it a bit easier and reconnects them with people, not takes them away. And I'd like to think that if I had teenagers who were in distress and teenagers that were struggling, if there were tools that helped them, that that would do just that. It would help them. It wouldn't replace human contact. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ZOMORODI: In a minute, the ethical dilemmas with giving our technology a face. I'm Manoush Zomorodi, and you're listening to the TED Radio Hour from NPR. Stick with us. It's the TED Radio Hour from NPR. I'm Manoush Zomorodi. And on the show today - What's in a Face. We were just hearing from Mike Seymour, a film industry veteran who now wants our virtual helpers to look and act more human. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SEYMOUR: Hi, I'm Mike - well, kind of virtual Mike, really. This is our Digital Human Project, which is a virtual human but one rendered in real time, puppeteered or driven in real time, rendered in real time. And not only that. . . ZOMORODI: Mike says that technology with a face can better interact with us, talk to patients about how they're feeling, ask students where they're struggling in algebra, coach brain injury survivors to be more self-sufficient. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ZOMORODI: So many different types of technology, so many different use-case scenarios, as you've mentioned - I expect we're going to see this area explode in the next few years. But along the way, wow, do we have a lot of ethical dilemmas to sort out. I mean, you're just reminding me - we've talked about this on the show a lot - the deepfakes. You know, there's the famous case of seeing President Obama giving a speech that he never gave. Where do you see some of the pitfalls that we need to watch out for? SEYMOUR: Manoush, I completely agree with you. Some of the applications of this technology by what I would describe as bad actors is appalling and just, you know, absolutely indefensible. It's a really interesting sort of, I guess, fundamental ethical question. Is the technology good or evil, or is it the use of it and the application of it? And I only can say this. For me, personally, you can use steel to make ambulances or tanks. I'm in the business of trying to see if we can't use it to make lots of good ambulances. I know some people are going to make tanks, but that's something I don't have any control over. But I do feel that it's going to happen. And the best line of defense we have to the deception that can be done by this technology is an informed public. So if you see something that's highly improbable, you're going to say, hang on a second; that's probably been faked or not real. Or you'll dig in to try and discover its authenticity. So there's a lot of ways we can produce inaccurate material, but an informed public that is aware of what's going on, that understands what the sort of limits of technology are and, you know, where it's going, is vital to being able to do this sort of stuff. So. . . ZOMORODI: But are we just barreling towards a future where, you know, your identity gets stolen, but it's not just your Social Security number; it's your face that can make it look like you're handing over your bank account number to someone on a Zoom call, like, or is my imagination way ahead of the technology? SEYMOUR: Gosh, I mean, people will deceive people with this technology. But yeah, when I'm talking about these AIs, they work very well when you've got a limited amount of stuff that you're asking them to do. So if I was having an agent that was helping you as a math tutor and it was discussing math and explaining mathematical concepts, that could be completely plausible and look photorealistic and wonderful. But if I asked my math assistant, what does it mean to understand existential philosophy in France, it would completely blank out. So we're not talking about a general intelligence. People quickly extrapolate to that, but we are so far away from that. General AI intelligence is a long way off. But, as I say, these plausible, realistic, germane, specific applications in health, in aged care, in all of these sort of parts of everyday life, completely plausible and extremely likely to happen because we just love faces. We love face-to-face communication. We love seeing people face to face. Humanity just likes faces. We're talking about just putting a face on technology so that it's a bit more friendly, a bit more empathetic, a bit more engaging, that has an emotional response, and therefore we find it to be a better, more pleasurable experience. ZOMORODI: That's Mike Seymour. He's a researcher and academic at the University of Sydney. You can see his talk at ted. com. MANOUSH ZOMORODI, HOST:   On the show today - What's in a Face. Often, to understand how technology will change our lives, we just need to watch a movie, like this one released in 2021. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"THE CHAMPION\") UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #2: (As character, non-English language spoken). MIKE SEYMOUR: So \"The Champion\" was a film shot and made in Poland. So everyone's speaking, basically, Polish or German. ZOMORODI: This is Mike Seymour. He's a researcher at the University of Sydney and works in the film industry in special effects. SEYMOUR: And it's a great film. It's a true story about one of the first members of Auschwitz who was a boxer. Terribly moving story, but of course, only in Polish or German. ZOMORODI: And usually when there's a foreign film that wants to break into the English-speaking market, there are three options. SEYMOUR: Dubbing it, so we get somebody else to voice over a different piece of dialogue. But, of course, the lips aren't right, so it looks kind of odd. ZOMORODI: Or there's subtitles. SEYMOUR: Or we have the new version of what we call facial reenactment. ZOMORODI: Facial reenactment - it's a new technique that Mike and his team used on \"The Champion. \" SEYMOUR: We got involved as part of a team to convert the entire film to English. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"THE CHAMPION\") UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #3: (As character, non-English language spoken). SEYMOUR: So now if you were to watch the film in English, every actor speaks as if they'd been shot in English. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"THE CHAMPION\") UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #3: (As character) The Dutch king of Warsaw, totaling almost a hundred fights in bantam and featherweights. SEYMOUR: So we've replaced, effectively, the actors' faces with their own faces saying the lines in English. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"THE CHAMPION\") UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #4: (As character) He looks more like a small rooster plucked of its feathers than a champion. ZOMORODI: OK, so, Mike, when I watch this English version, it's seamless. It's like, their mouths, their faces, everything looks like it was originally shot this way, in English. Is this common in the industry? Is it normal? SEYMOUR: Well, it's the first time anyone's done it in the world, but hopefully it's going to become normal. In fact. . . ZOMORODI: As Mike went on to explain, months after filming, the actors rerecorded all their lines in English as cameras taped their voices and facial expressions. And then, through a process called neural rendering technology, their faces were replaced, so it looks like the film was just shot twice in two different languages. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"THE CHAMPION\") UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #4: (As Bruno) Come on, Teddy. Come on. ZOMORODI: The film industry is always pioneering new tech to trick our eye, to make someone or something look real. But over the last few years, Mike has been developing ways to use these techniques in our real lives. SEYMOUR: Yeah. Could we take this tech and just sort of use it outside the film industry? That fascinated me, where I say, well, hey, I don't want to get shaven and put on a suit for my important meeting today, so I'll just flip a switch and get digital makeup, and I'll look a whole lot better and a whole lot smarter. And I would be able to, say, speak in Korean when I absolutely can't speak in Korean. ZOMORODI: Yeah. SEYMOUR: And that, we hope, would facilitate much more genuine communications across cultural divides. ZOMORODI: Wow. You're saying that maybe one day, if - I have relatives all over the world who speak all different languages, but maybe one day we could do FaceTime, and it would sound as though I was speaking fluent Swedish, and they were speaking back to me - well, they can't speak English, but that we would hear each other's native tongue and wouldn't know the difference. It would look as though I could speak fluent Swedish, but they - it wouldn't look like I was not myself. SEYMOUR: Yes. There is a lot of modern technology that's very sophisticated that would, we think, benefit from being able to have an extra layer of communication that you get from face-to-face interaction. We're kind of this nexus point where that's possible. ZOMORODI: Mike Seymour picks up from the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) SEYMOUR: We're interested in being able to see if we can put a face on technology because how would you react when a computer reacts to you with a smile? Would a 6-year-old learn math better if there was a 6-year-old teacher on the screen? What about if it was a slightly older version of herself? Would a grandparent having a cup of tea be more likely to check in with a computer system if they didn't have to log in and type - they could just talk to a virtual agent that actually was somebody from their past? This is what we're excited to explore with digital humans. Our ability to produce digital humans up until recently has been quite limited, but we're now seeing interactive digital humans starting to appear. The doors are opening. We are at an inflection point. We have this perfect storm of faster GPU graphics cards, new artificial intelligence deep-learning algorithms and great advances in game engines. It's an incredible combination of things coming together. This tremendous nexus of points is just providing us with an extraordinary opportunity of things that we can do. The important thing about this technology is that we can now use this to get these faces to work with us in real time. In other words - and this is a really key point - the faces that we're talking about can talk, interact and see us. ZOMORODI: OK, putting faces on our technology - tell me more about how you see this working and the reasons why we would want it. SEYMOUR: Yeah. I mean, there are a lot. Already in New Zealand, there is automatic sign languaging. So if somebody is speaking in digital human signs for the deaf community, you might have an assistant sitting in on a Zoom call that you can ask to help book future things, take notes, do stuff. In aged care, you could have an assistant that logs in with somebody each day and makes sure that they're OK and are lucid and they've taken their pills, not to replace a health care worker but just simply that - to make sure that they're OK and facilitate them staying in the home longer. And so in a world where we're saying, hey, you know, even to use the phone, there are no buttons now; you have to, you know, swipe up, swipe left, all this stuff. People are like, I have trouble with that. And so we could bring a face from their past that would be the one that they interact with that technology. ZOMORODI: You don't think that would be odd to someone? If you said, well, this is your sister. She's not actually your sister. She just kind of looks like your sister, and she's going to help you use your phone. That - I don't know. That might freak me out. SEYMOUR: Yeah. You know, you've just touched on a really interesting point. People, when asked, traditionally say, I wouldn't like that. So if you project ahead - you say, hey, would you have a digital human tell you what to do? They go, no, no, no, absolutely not. That would be freaky. And yet, every time we do a lab test, they completely don't do that. ZOMORODI: I looked up one of those services that might be available in the near future. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) SOUL: Hello. This is Soul, Dr. Beanie's assistant. TYLER: Hello, Soul, this is Tyler. I wanted to ask you about my recent surgery. ZOMORODI: In the demo video, a man is home after knee surgery and consults on his laptop with his AI nurse. Soul seemed to know her stuff. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) SOUL: The discharge summary states that you should take the pain medicine about 20 minutes before you put on your headset for your virtual reality meditation therapy. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ZOMORODI: Mike, I don't know. I have to be honest. I was a little unnerved by Soul. SEYMOUR: Sure. What I would say is it was her lack of authenticity that probably bothered you, not the digital representation of the face. Once you get to a certain level of quality, you kind of pass what we've referred to as the uncanny valley. So you now have got something that looks pretty darn good. It doesn't matter whether you can tell it's real or not. That's not the deciding factor. It's the authenticity of the emotional kind of response that matters, and that's the driving factor. And so for us to succeed in those cases, we really need to make sure that it's the - sort of the back end behind the face that's delivering what's wanted, not so much the face itself. ZOMORODI: Speaking of the uncanny valley, you did a demonstration on stage where you showed off a very realistic digital version of your head, your face, on a screen that you could control. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) SEYMOUR: Hi, I'm Mike - well, kind of virtual Mike, really. This is our Digital Human Project, which is a collaboration of a whole bunch of people coming together to produce, well, a virtual human. And not only a virtual human. . . ZOMORODI: I mean, people, like, right now we can make digital avatars of ourselves, but not like this, not to this realistic extent. How hard was that to build? SEYMOUR: Yeah, I mean, we sort of are close. I mean, that one took a lot of people. So we scanned my face, and I got my face done in one of the most high-resolution facial-scanning systems in the world. It produced this super realistic version of my head. Then I could puppeteer that in real time or have it driven. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) SEYMOUR: So how do we do it? So first, we scanned my face. This allowed us to produce a very complex digital avatar of my head, or a digital puppet. Then, with a camera mounted on a head rig, the computer can actually read my face. An advanced AI engine then basically interprets that into expressions. Now the computer can tell the digital puppet what to do. In effect, what's happening is it's the computer telling the muscles in the digital Mike how to smile, talk or do things. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ZOMORODI: It makes me wonder if we might get to a point where kids think, well, I would much rather deal with my extremely realistic-looking tutor on my laptop who responds to me but who doesn't actually give me a hard time and won't be offended if I tell it to shut up. What - how do we make sure that people don't choose these artificially intelligent agents over humans? SEYMOUR: Brilliant question, and I wish I had a definitive answer. I can only give you my hope. So imagine I'm a vet. I come back. But I'm an 18-year-old guy. I've experienced some horrendous experiences in a conflict, and I am now suffering from all sorts of sexual dysfunction. I cry at night. I have, like, things I'm really embarrassed about and ashamed of. I kind of want help, but I don't want to have to sit there and tell a doctor that.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)PARMY OLSON: I was actually literally just today talking to a facial recognition vendor. ZOMORODI: What about? OLSON: So they're in the middle of filing a patent where artificial intelligence or machine learning system will look at your face and determine how you feel. . . ZOMORODI: This is Bloomberg tech columnist Parmy Olson. OLSON: . . . Which will allow them to analyze the faces of stock market traders and bond traders to get a sense of where the market is moving based on the emotions shown on the faces of these traders. In a way, that sounds maybe a little bit innocuous, if not a very odd way and potentially disastrous way to determine where the market is going. I don't know that that would work. But I think the question is, well, what happens when all these different vendors and stakeholders have access to our faces and can maybe get to a point where they want to start drawing inferences about us based on our faces? ZOMORODI: Now, even if making market decisions based on the minute facial expressions of day traders sounds far-fetched, Parmy says the basic technology behind it is not. OLSON: So these systems are essentially trained on millions and millions of actual photos of people. And the more data it has, the more accurate it can get. And I think the concern is that this technology is so widespread and so actually not that difficult to build. Some of the technology is open source. There are billions of images of faces on the internet. It's relatively cheap to do it. ZOMORODI: Yeah. And it's so cheap that you have written about how this software is now used pretty widely in retail, even gas stations, convenience stores. OLSON: Yeah. I think the main reason that retailers want to use facial recognition in their shops is to actually look for unwanted individuals. So there was a chain of stores in the U. K. that hired a security system - a facial recognition security system to be installed. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)OLSON: Let's go to Aylesbury, southern England, and to a Budgens store. ZOMORODI: Parmy Olsen continues from the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)OLSON: Now, Budgens in this particular town has been having trouble in the last few years with people coming in and stealing meat from their refrigeration aisle. So a year ago, they installed some new technology from a company called Facewatch. And through their usual CCTV cameras, Facewatch's computer and software would scan every single face that came into the Budgens and match it up against a watch list. Now, this watch list is processed by Facewatch, and Budgens can also add to it if they suspect someone of stealing. And I called up the Budgens and asked how they thought it was working. And the staff member there told me that his phone gets pinged up to 10 times a day with an alert to say that someone has walked in the store who matches the watch list. So if that happens, he might call the police if it's an aggressive person, or he might just say, hey, you're on CCTV. And actually, it works pretty well. He said he thinks it's helped. But there's a few concerns about Facewatch. So first of all, to get on the watch list, you don't have to be arrested. And you don't have to be charged by the police. There's no real legal due process. And the other thing is that to be uploaded onto the servers of Facewatch to be on a watch list, you can be on it for up to two years, and you won't be taken off. ZOMORODI: So this is a security company that relies on watch lists. And anyone with clearance - I guess that could be a store employee - they could add someone to the list. And then - what? - that information is shared? OLSON: Yes, that's right. Each store would have their own watch list. And they would share the watch lists with each other. So you'd have an even bigger watch list. And, yes, the people who are on these systems - this is a private system. This is not something where there's a court order or a warrant or anything like that there. This is totally done privately by a business. It's their own private watch list that they've put together. ZOMORODI: So, Parmy, one of the underlining problems with this kind of mass surveillance is that sometimes the algorithms are wrong. OLSON: Right. When I talked to one of the people who worked at one of these stores, they said that about 25% of the time, the system was wrong. So they would get the alert, get told that person had walked in. Then they'd walk round, and they'd see, actually, it wasn't that person. And so they had to really be careful to trust that the system was correct. In real world, when you know, the lighting isn't that good and the image might be a little bit grainy, not surprisingly, the system was getting it wrong 1 out of 4 times. ZOMORODI: Wow. And I can imagine someone thinking like, OK, well, it's a grocery store. But if you're talking about a situation involving law enforcement, that could get - quickly escalate, I would think. OLSON: Yeah. So a police officer has a body cam with facial recognition or a camera on their van with facial recognition, and they detect someone. And if that person has increased melanin in their skin or they're Black, essentially, then it is more likely to make a mistake in identifying that person. And the reason is that the databases that these facial recognition models are trained on typically have way more white people than Black people. And so the system just isn't trained enough on Black people, so it doesn't identify them properly. It makes more mistakes. And that has happened. And it's probably going to continue to happen, too. ZOMORODI: When we come back, what are we willing to stomach in a face-tracking-filled future? On the show today, What's in a Face. I'm Manoush Zomorodi, and you're listening to the TED Radio Hour from NPR. Stay with us. It's the TED Radio Hour from NPR. I'm Manoush Zomorodi, and on today's show, What's in a Face - and how companies will use them to make money. We were just talking to Bloomberg columnist Parmy Olson. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)OLSON: Each one of our faces has a face print. It's like a fingerprint, except it's a string of numbers that corresponds with the image of our face. And there are lots of databases of people's face prints out there on the internet. ZOMORODI: And even if they aren't identifying us by name, our faces can be tracked, categorized and profited off of. For example, a few years ago, Walgreens installed cameras in some of their stores that identified shoppers by age, gender and then displayed targeted ads. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #1: (As character) Yo. New Sprite? ZOMORODI: Like, do you look male and around 20 years old? (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #1: (As character) . . . Refreshing Sprite. ZOMORODI: Buy a Sprite. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: New Lipton green iced tea. ZOMORODI: Fifty and female? Maybe a green tea. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: Your Subaru has a driver-monitoring system. . . ZOMORODI: Carmaker Subaru's new vehicles use facial recognition tech that create user profiles. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: That saves each driver's unique seat and mirror preferences. ZOMORODI: . . . And even alert a driver if they seem distracted or tired. (SOUNDBITE OF SLOT MACHINES BEEPING)ZOMORODI: And then there are casinos. OLSON: So there is a casino in London which has facial recognition cameras dotted around all the different rooms. And it uses that so that when high rollers walk in to a certain room, then the staff get an alert on their phone, which gets sent to an encrypted chat app they use called Wickr. And then they notify each other - like, oh, so-and-so, this hostess should go up because that's the high roller's favorite. We know that they like this particular type of food and this particular type of drink. And so they can actually provide a better service. And they call it their white glove service. And I remember asking the head of security, well, are the patrons actually a little bit put off by that? And he said, not at all. Not a single one thinks that that's even the slightest bit creepy. They just see it as part of the service. It's what they expect. And I think it's a nice little allegory for just how this kind of surveillance is going to eventually come to serve the rest of us as consumers, that the convenience will ultimately be something that we just take for granted, and we won't worry too much about the price that we're paying with our privacy. And I think that is just the way it'll go. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ZOMORODI: I mean, I guess I can see the appeal if you're opting into a luxury service. I mean, that just feels very different than being tracked while you're walking down the street or going into a store. I just don't think that that is something a lot of us would sign up for. OLSON: Yeah. I would say that facial recognition definitely has become a controversial subject, and I think that's made it difficult for brands, for advertisers, who might be able to benefit from using it to target their brands at people. They've had to take a step back. ZOMORODI: Yeah, there are a number of retailers now - I think this is what you're referring to - who are facing lawsuits for surveillance, for gathering data on their customers without consent. OLSON: Mmm hmm. ZOMORODI: But really, like, for now, it just feels like whack-a-mole because we have not figured out, as a society, what we think is OK and what isn't OK when it comes to face tracking. OLSON: Yes, that's right. Companies who develop these kinds of systems need to be very careful. There needs to be more ethical oversight of how these systems are developed. And right now that's only going to come from regulation, which is a couple years away, yes, but also campaign groups. And there are some really good civil liberties groups in the United States and Europe who are really keeping an eye on this and just helping keep companies on their toes. If there wasn't the amount of kind of upset that had been created around facial recognition, I think there'd be a lot more advertisers using it right now. But because people have really rung alarm bells about it, then I think that's made companies really just take stock and just sit back and just say, OK, let's just be a little bit more cautious about how we use this. And I think that's a really good thing. ZOMORODI: Given that there still aren't major regulations out there around facial recognition, I mean, aren't we just at the point of no return here? Is - I mean, can't go back. OLSON: There definitely needs to be more laws and regulation, but we have sort of gone past trying to force companies to design algorithms in a way that are safe and ethical because the algorithm's already out there. But there is a law coming from the European Union called the AI Act, and it actually bans all forms of facial recognition for surveillance by police unless it's for trying to combat terrorism. So that's a pretty blunt rule. And, I mean, that's going to be the first kind of comprehensive legislation around the use of artificial intelligence algorithms. I think the issue with it is that it is so broad. It's not just about facial recognition; it's about all forms of AI. So whether that's recommendation systems on social media or facial recognition, you know, it covers a lot. And so enforcing it, I think, is going to be difficult. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ZOMORODI: You know, one of the reasons all this tracking is possible is because we have accepted the idea that cameras are in our pockets all the time. They're on our doors. They are all over public spaces. And we're OK with it. We are OK, largely, with being surveilled. OLSON: Yeah. There's something like 20 million homes in the U. S. have a video doorbell. The thing about Ring doorbells that I think is really interesting is that, actually, the studies that have been done about just how effective these cameras are in reducing neighborhood crime show that the evidence is really flimsy. There's actually not much evidence that they do reduce crime. But the big impact is on human sentiment. So the owners of these cameras feel a greater sense of security and a greater sense of control. But then on the other hand, we also collectively come to accept that our behavior is being watched. So, yeah, take that how you will. I think we are just an increasingly surveilled society. And I think people are just like slow-boiled frogs; we're increasingly accepting of it because it's just what's happening, for better or worse. ZOMORODI: That's Parmy Olson. She's a tech columnist at Bloomberg, and you can see her full talk at ted. npr. org. And earlier, we heard from super-recognizer Yenny Seo, who works as a translator in Australia. MANOUSH ZOMORODI, HOST:   Today, What's in a Face - ideas about the promise and peril in turning the human face into an everyday digital tool for anyone to use. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) PARMY OLSON: I was actually literally just today talking to a facial recognition vendor. ZOMORODI: What about? OLSON: So they're in the middle of filing a patent where artificial intelligence or machine learning system will look at your face and determine how you feel. . . ZOMORODI: This is Bloomberg tech columnist Parmy Olson. OLSON: . . . Which will allow them to analyze the faces of stock market traders and bond traders to get a sense of where the market is moving based on the emotions shown on the faces of these traders. In a way, that sounds maybe a little bit innocuous, if not a very odd way and potentially disastrous way to determine where the market is going. I don't know that that would work. But I think the question is, well, what happens when all these different vendors and stakeholders have access to our faces and can maybe get to a point where they want to start drawing inferences about us based on our faces? ZOMORODI: Now, even if making market decisions based on the minute facial expressions of day traders sounds far-fetched, Parmy says the basic technology behind it is not. OLSON: So these systems are essentially trained on millions and millions of actual photos of people. And the more data it has, the more accurate it can get. And I think the concern is that this technology is so widespread and so actually not that difficult to build. Some of the technology is open source. There are billions of images of faces on the internet. It's relatively cheap to do it. ZOMORODI: Yeah. And it's so cheap that you have written about how this software is now used pretty widely in retail, even gas stations, convenience stores. OLSON: Yeah. I think the main reason that retailers want to use facial recognition in their shops is to actually look for unwanted individuals. So there was a chain of stores in the U. K. that hired a security system - a facial recognition security system to be installed. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) OLSON: Let's go to Aylesbury, southern England, and to a Budgens store. ZOMORODI: Parmy Olsen continues from the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) OLSON: Now, Budgens in this particular town has been having trouble in the last few years with people coming in and stealing meat from their refrigeration aisle. So a year ago, they installed some new technology from a company called Facewatch. And through their usual CCTV cameras, Facewatch's computer and software would scan every single face that came into the Budgens and match it up against a watch list. Now, this watch list is processed by Facewatch, and Budgens can also add to it if they suspect someone of stealing. And I called up the Budgens and asked how they thought it was working. And the staff member there told me that his phone gets pinged up to 10 times a day with an alert to say that someone has walked in the store who matches the watch list. So if that happens, he might call the police if it's an aggressive person, or he might just say, hey, you're on CCTV. And actually, it works pretty well. He said he thinks it's helped. But there's a few concerns about Facewatch. So first of all, to get on the watch list, you don't have to be arrested. And you don't have to be charged by the police. There's no real legal due process. And the other thing is that to be uploaded onto the servers of Facewatch to be on a watch list, you can be on it for up to two years, and you won't be taken off. ZOMORODI: So this is a security company that relies on watch lists. And anyone with clearance - I guess that could be a store employee - they could add someone to the list. And then - what? - that information is shared? OLSON: Yes, that's right. Each store would have their own watch list. And they would share the watch lists with each other. So you'd have an even bigger watch list. And, yes, the people who are on these systems - this is a private system. This is not something where there's a court order or a warrant or anything like that there. This is totally done privately by a business. It's their own private watch list that they've put together. ZOMORODI: So, Parmy, one of the underlining problems with this kind of mass surveillance is that sometimes the algorithms are wrong. OLSON: Right. When I talked to one of the people who worked at one of these stores, they said that about 25% of the time, the system was wrong. So they would get the alert, get told that person had walked in. Then they'd walk round, and they'd see, actually, it wasn't that person. And so they had to really be careful to trust that the system was correct. In real world, when you know, the lighting isn't that good and the image might be a little bit grainy, not surprisingly, the system was getting it wrong 1 out of 4 times. ZOMORODI: Wow. And I can imagine someone thinking like, OK, well, it's a grocery store. But if you're talking about a situation involving law enforcement, that could get - quickly escalate, I would think. OLSON: Yeah. So a police officer has a body cam with facial recognition or a camera on their van with facial recognition, and they detect someone. And if that person has increased melanin in their skin or they're Black, essentially, then it is more likely to make a mistake in identifying that person. And the reason is that the databases that these facial recognition models are trained on typically have way more white people than Black people. And so the system just isn't trained enough on Black people, so it doesn't identify them properly. It makes more mistakes. And that has happened. And it's probably going to continue to happen, too. ZOMORODI: When we come back, what are we willing to stomach in a face-tracking-filled future? On the show today, What's in a Face. I'm Manoush Zomorodi, and you're listening to the TED Radio Hour from NPR. Stay with us. It's the TED Radio Hour from NPR. I'm Manoush Zomorodi, and on today's show, What's in a Face - and how companies will use them to make money. We were just talking to Bloomberg columnist Parmy Olson. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) OLSON: Each one of our faces has a face print. It's like a fingerprint, except it's a string of numbers that corresponds with the image of our face. And there are lots of databases of people's face prints out there on the internet. ZOMORODI: And even if they aren't identifying us by name, our faces can be tracked, categorized and profited off of. For example, a few years ago, Walgreens installed cameras in some of their stores that identified shoppers by age, gender and then displayed targeted ads. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #1: (As character) Yo. New Sprite? ZOMORODI: Like, do you look male and around 20 years old? (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #1: (As character) . . . Refreshing Sprite. ZOMORODI: Buy a Sprite. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: New Lipton green iced tea. ZOMORODI: Fifty and female? Maybe a green tea. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: Your Subaru has a driver-monitoring system. . . ZOMORODI: Carmaker Subaru's new vehicles use facial recognition tech that create user profiles. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: That saves each driver's unique seat and mirror preferences. ZOMORODI: . . . And even alert a driver if they seem distracted or tired. (SOUNDBITE OF SLOT MACHINES BEEPING) ZOMORODI: And then there are casinos. OLSON: So there is a casino in London which has facial recognition cameras dotted around all the different rooms. And it uses that so that when high rollers walk in to a certain room, then the staff get an alert on their phone, which gets sent to an encrypted chat app they use called Wickr. And then they notify each other - like, oh, so-and-so, this hostess should go up because that's the high roller's favorite. We know that they like this particular type of food and this particular type of drink. And so they can actually provide a better service. And they call it their white glove service. And I remember asking the head of security, well, are the patrons actually a little bit put off by that? And he said, not at all. Not a single one thinks that that's even the slightest bit creepy. They just see it as part of the service. It's what they expect. And I think it's a nice little allegory for just how this kind of surveillance is going to eventually come to serve the rest of us as consumers, that the convenience will ultimately be something that we just take for granted, and we won't worry too much about the price that we're paying with our privacy. And I think that is just the way it'll go. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ZOMORODI: I mean, I guess I can see the appeal if you're opting into a luxury service. I mean, that just feels very different than being tracked while you're walking down the street or going into a store. I just don't think that that is something a lot of us would sign up for. OLSON: Yeah. I would say that facial recognition definitely has become a controversial subject, and I think that's made it difficult for brands, for advertisers, who might be able to benefit from using it to target their brands at people. They've had to take a step back. ZOMORODI: Yeah, there are a number of retailers now - I think this is what you're referring to - who are facing lawsuits for surveillance, for gathering data on their customers without consent. OLSON: Mmm hmm. ZOMORODI: But really, like, for now, it just feels like whack-a-mole because we have not figured out, as a society, what we think is OK and what isn't OK when it comes to face tracking. OLSON: Yes, that's right. Companies who develop these kinds of systems need to be very careful. There needs to be more ethical oversight of how these systems are developed. And right now that's only going to come from regulation, which is a couple years away, yes, but also campaign groups. And there are some really good civil liberties groups in the United States and Europe who are really keeping an eye on this and just helping keep companies on their toes. If there wasn't the amount of kind of upset that had been created around facial recognition, I think there'd be a lot more advertisers using it right now.

She died in 1984. And though not well-recognized during her lifetime, Thornton helped shape the sound and swagger of rock 'n' roll. She's now an inspiration for a new generation. Allyson McCabe has the story. ALLYSON MCCABE, BYLINE: In 2000, a student project in Portland, Ore. , led to the formation of rock camps around the world, providing mentor opportunities for girls to learn all aspects of writing and performing music. Here in Brooklyn, Willie Mae Rock Camp was one of the first. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED CAMP COUNSELOR: Willie Mae. UNIDENTIFIED CHILDREN: Future sound. UNIDENTIFIED CAMP COUNSELOR: Willie Mae. UNIDENTIFIED CHILDREN: Future sound. UNIDENTIFIED CAMP COUNSELOR: Willie Mae. UNIDENTIFIED CHILDREN: Future sound. UNIDENTIFIED CAMP COUNSELOR: You guys are the future sound of Willie Mae \"Big Mama\" Thornton. OK? MCCABE: Executive Director LaFrae Sci says instruction starts with sounds in the kids' everyday lives. LAFRAE SCI: Their abuela turning on the oven in the morning to make tortillas or the sound of their father's keys in their pocket when he gets up to go to work. And we bring that into music, and we also teach them to listen to their voice within that helps them develop the voice that they use outside in the world. MCCABE: Kids as young as 5 learn how to bang on the drums and shred on guitars but also work with electronic instruments and music technology, like the synth, samples and coding app that 10-year-old Oonagh Wickens used to create a multimedia piece she calls \"Kuro Neko. \"OONAGH WICKENS: My sounds and my project - they're synth sounds. And, like, when I couldn't find the right one or, like, when I couldn't get the thing that I liked, there were tons of people here to, like, support and help me. MCCABE: Willie Mae's year-round programming is offered at no cost to girls and gender-expansive youth, the majority of whom identify as BIPOC. As trailblazers, they're following in the footsteps of the real-life Willie Mae, says cultural anthropologist Maureen Mahon. MAUREEN MAHON: Willie Mae Thornton was born in Alabama. And at a very young age, she went out on the road as a blues singer. She was 14 years old when she left home, and she really never looked back. MCCABE: Along with Sister Rosetta Tharpe and LaVern Baker, Thornton was one of the foremothers of rock n' roll. MAHON: When rock 'n' roll was invented a few years after she got her first recording deal, she didn't affiliate herself with that form. She thought rock 'n' roll was just the blues speeded up. But what's interesting is that the rock 'n' rollers thought she was interesting. She kind of laid a template for a sound and an attitude. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"HOUND DOG\")WILLIE MAE THORNTON: You ain't nothing but a hound dog. Been snooping 'round my door. MCCABE: Thornton recorded \"Hound Dog\" in 1952, four years before Elvis. And she wrote \"Ball And Chain,\" which became a big hit for Janis Joplin in '68. Mahon says Thornton carried the torch of the blues while refusing to dim her light. MAHON: A person who was just her own self, unapologetically so. The idea of self-expression is so crucial. MCCABE: Even when new styles emerged. Nona Hendryx was in her teens when she embarked on her musical career in the early 1960s. She says her first love was actually science. (SOUNDBITE OF THE BLUEBELLES SONG, \"TEAR AFTER TEAR\")NONA HENDRYX: My older brother, he was a home-made mechanic, so he could take pretty much anything apart. It was a car or even, like, our television. And I would watch him investigating, looking into things, looking underneath things, taking things apart and seeing what's inside. MCCABE: When her band, The Bluebelles, morphed into Labelle in the '70s, Hendryx grew curious about how her musical ideas could be translated into sound - the art and science of recording. HENDRYX: A woman named Roberta Grace, who was the only woman engineer that I had come across, she began to show me how to work with the electronics that were underneath the board, how they were soldered together, how you would put together a mixing board. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"TRANSFORMATION\")HENDRYX: (Singing) I move and I go in time, fast or slow. MCCABE: In her solo career, Hendryx has continued using technology to communicate and connect with audiences. But according to the USC Annenberg Inclusion Initiative, women are underrepresented as artists and songwriters and make up less than 3% of credited music producers. For women of color, that number is even lower. HENDRYX: So that's why Willie Mae is so important - that, you know, going there and seeing the young girls taking toys apart and using the circuits within them to learn circuit bending. . . UNIDENTIFIED CHILD: This is really good. HENDRYX: . . . To graduate to where you're just dealing with frequencies and generating sound, turning that into rhythm, turning that into melodies, turning that into a beat, turning that into a song. MCCABE: Like 9-year-old Kendal Ryant's \"Earth Needs Help,\" which she composed on a synthesizer. (SOUNDBITE OF KENDALL RYANT'S \"EARTH NEEDS HELP\")KENDAL RYANT: When I first started playing around with it, I kept messing around with it, turning it to, like, the different sounds. The best thing about Willie Mae is I get to mess around and find out. MCCABE: Some of these kids may go on to careers as artists, producers and engineers, others in science and technology. LaFrae Sci says the main goal is to nurture them as creators, laying the path for future sounds. SCI: I have always really felt that music can bring us together, build community, heal and empower. I call what I do being an imaginationist. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"HOUND DOG\")THORNTON: (Singing) You ain't nothing but a hound dog. MCCABE: For NPR News, I'm Allyson McCabe.

(SOUNDBITE OF DROP ELECTRIC'S \"WAKING UP TO THE FIRE\")DARIAN WOODS, HOST:  Derek Thompson, staff writer for The Atlantic magazine, welcome to the show. DEREK THOMPSON: Yeah, hi. WOODS: You have an article out today looking at something you'd coin the eureka myth - the idea that we lionize inventors, but we ignore, you know, the good work of getting those inventions out to people. You argue it's a particular problem in the U. S. , but you start in 18th century England with the story of the first vaccine. So tell me that story. THOMPSON: May 14, 1796, is a golden day in the history of science. The physician, Edward Jenner, sticks a blade that is slick with the ooze of a cowpox blister into the arm of a young boy named James Phipps. WOODS: Yummy. THOMPSON: This is not a particularly moral thing to do, by the way. WOODS: The ethics board was a little looser back in those days. THOMPSON: It was a lot looser back in those days. In any case, everyone gets lucky. Young James comes down with a bit of the chills, but he recovers very swiftly. And Edward Jenner realizes that he has done something remarkable. He has immunized this boy from smallpox by injecting him with the pustule of cowpox. WOODS: This is this pivotal moment in history. And then we fast forward to today, and smallpox is eliminated. THOMPSON: Wait, wait. WOODS: What. . . THOMPSON: Let me stop you there. That's just the problem. The problem is that we fast forward. We tell this lush story of the smallpox vaccine, and then we say, yada, yada, yada (ph), the world was rid of smallpox. No, no. That is the perfect example of how our focus on the moment of invention leaves out 99% of the story. How did smallpox go not only from 0 to 1 in 1796 but from 1 to 1 billion, to become the first invention of humankind that eradicates a disease? That is the question that I am most interested in. WOODS: This is THE INDICATOR FROM PLANET MONEY. I'm Darian Woods. Today on the show, Derek Thompson on the eureka myth and why he thinks the U. S. is great at invention but lackluster at scaling up those new technologies. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)WOODS: Derek Thompson from The Atlantic, thank you so much for joining us to talk about how the U. S. can better deploy new innovations. THOMPSON: Great to be here. WOODS: So tell me about Vannevar Bush, the science official in the 1950s. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Dr. Bush was the first of our scientific advisers. WOODS: How did Vannevar Bush shape technology policy in the U. S. ? THOMPSON: Vannevar published a report called \"Science: The Endless Frontier. \"WOODS: Very \"Star Trek. \"THOMPSON: Yes. And he told the federal government that he had a plan for bringing America forward in the 20th century. He said, we need to dramatically scale up the amount of money that we spend on research in science and technology. And this policy was responsible for beefing up the NIH, the National Science Foundation and for giving us, in many ways, the bedrock of our science and tech policy. But there's a problem because the bedrock of America's science and technology policy in the late 20th century and early 21st century was we pour billions of dollars into basic science and defense, and then we basically just, like, get out of the way and hope that all of these inventions become implemented. WOODS: And that Vannevar's vision, right? THOMPSON: In many ways, we are living in the world that Vannevar built. And that world, I would argue, is the eureka myth vision of progress. It's the idea that if we just spend billions and billions and more billions of dollars on invention, then utopia will inevitably follow. WOODS: And there's kind of two main parts. It's the invention part or the fundamental research part of science and technology - that's where there's a huge role for government because there is this public good aspect. It makes a lot of sense for the taxpayer to be funding this. And then there's this second part that's kind of the commercial applications. That's for private companies. It kind of makes more sense for the private sector to be making risks on that. So what's the subtlety that we're missing there? THOMPSON: The subtlety is that this leads to a world where the U. S. is the planet's research and development factory. But when it comes to actually building what we have invented, we go backwards. So you look at what's happened in the U. S. over the last few decades. The U. S. invented the solar cell, and in many ways, we were the world leaders in wind energy in the middle of the 20th century. But in many ways, our efforts to decarbonize the grid have been held back by environmental regulations that make it hard to build solar and wind plants. So we've created this world where the U. S. , again, is amazing at invention but not particularly good at implementation. And I think that's holding us back from a ton of progress. WOODS: But your article did say that the U. S. government once partnered with private industry to roll out technologies. What are some examples of that? THOMPSON: We can go back 160 years. The administration of President Abraham Lincoln famously helped build the railroads. You go back to the New Deal. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Congress has provided additional funds. . . THOMPSON: . . . Where we electrified rural America(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: . . . To encourage production of every kind by private enterprise. THOMPSON: JFK and the space program is a great example. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JOHN F KENNEDY: Space expenditures will soon rise some more from $0. 40 per person per week to more than $0. 50 a week for every man, woman and child in the United States. THOMPSON: The microchip was invented in the 1950s, and the Apollo program was an early major consumer of microchips. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"MIT SCIENCE REPORTER\")JOHN FITCH: The Apollo computers are manufactured by the Raytheon Company in Waltham, Mass. THOMPSON: They bought so many microchips that they helped reduce the price of them by a factor of 30 in a matter of years. WOODS: Wow. THOMPSON: Without the Apollo program, the software revolution might have been delayed for the entire world by a matter of decades. So this just seems to me to be a great example of how once you see that cost is a part of progress, you see the role that government can usefully play in helping to bring it down. WOODS: Is it really better for the government to be trying to figure out the best way to roll out these technologies versus the market to make those calls? THOMPSON: There's an idea in industrial policy and in economics called the valley of death. WOODS: The valley of death? THOMPSON: Yeah. WOODS: All right. Go on. THOMPSON: The valley of death essentially says that there are some products - pharmaceuticals, maybe complex industrial products - that are invented or nearly patented. There's a lot of, say, VC money that comes in at the beginning of the process to spin up the company that's making this stuff, but there's no help to make the thing reliable, cheap and available to the masses. And so, so many ideas die in this valley of death. WOODS: So there's one kind of glaring exception to the story you're telling, and I want to just focus in on Operation Warp Speed. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)DONALD TRUMP: . . . Operation Warp Speed. We've pioneered groundbreaking therapies. WOODS: So that was the Trump administration's initiative to accelerate the development and distribution of COVID vaccines. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: . . . Will produce a vaccine in record time. . . WOODS: And, like, this put a lot of real muscle into the rollout and deployment of some really new vaccine technology. So what can we learn from Operation Warp Speed? THOMPSON: Operation Warp Speed was a brilliant piece of legislation for the implementation of these vaccines. The typical journey of a new therapy from the lab to a person's arm is this crazy obstacle course, and Operation Warp Speed turned that obstacle course into a glide path. They invested in a bunch of different vaccine platforms, including synthetic mRNA. They bought space for manufacturing. They identified shortages in the full supply chain of the vaccines so that, for example, they would have the right ultracold transport material to go from Part A to CDSB. And as a result of doing all of this, we set land speed records for the development and administration of a new vaccine. WOODS: Right. I mean, like, what could we have as an Operation Warp Speed? THOMPSON: I think we could have an Operation Warp Speed for all sorts of other things. We could have an Operation Warp Speed for cancer prevention. We could have an Operation Warp Speed for geothermal energy or carbon removal. I think we live in a world where crises abound, and it's up to us to decide which of them deserve a warp speed-style policy. But you need cultural demand for any of this to work. And so I think it's really important for people who are interested in technological progress to realize that they're interested in a cultural question. How do you get people to want new things? WOODS: Well, Derek Thompson, thank you so much for joining THE INDICATOR. THOMPSON: Thank you very much.

Viet Le is our senior producer, and Kate Concannon edits the show. THE INDICATOR is a production of NPR. SYLVIE DOUGLIS, BYLINE: NPR. (SOUNDBITE OF DROP ELECTRIC'S \"WAKING UP TO THE FIRE\") DARIAN WOODS, HOST:   Derek Thompson, staff writer for The Atlantic magazine, welcome to the show. DEREK THOMPSON: Yeah, hi. WOODS: You have an article out today looking at something you'd coin the eureka myth - the idea that we lionize inventors, but we ignore, you know, the good work of getting those inventions out to people. You argue it's a particular problem in the U. S. , but you start in 18th century England with the story of the first vaccine. So tell me that story. THOMPSON: May 14, 1796, is a golden day in the history of science. The physician, Edward Jenner, sticks a blade that is slick with the ooze of a cowpox blister into the arm of a young boy named James Phipps. WOODS: Yummy. THOMPSON: This is not a particularly moral thing to do, by the way. WOODS: The ethics board was a little looser back in those days. THOMPSON: It was a lot looser back in those days. In any case, everyone gets lucky. Young James comes down with a bit of the chills, but he recovers very swiftly. And Edward Jenner realizes that he has done something remarkable. He has immunized this boy from smallpox by injecting him with the pustule of cowpox. WOODS: This is this pivotal moment in history. And then we fast forward to today, and smallpox is eliminated. THOMPSON: Wait, wait. WOODS: What. . . THOMPSON: Let me stop you there. That's just the problem. The problem is that we fast forward. We tell this lush story of the smallpox vaccine, and then we say, yada, yada, yada (ph), the world was rid of smallpox. No, no. That is the perfect example of how our focus on the moment of invention leaves out 99% of the story.

They had just landed a job as a research scientist working on Instagram. HUY TU: I was very excited for it because I feel like everything finally clicked. It's like what I wanted - the location, the job package. CHANG: Tu is from Vietnam. They came to the U. S. eight years ago to study, and this was their first real tech industry job. Tu says it just felt like they were finally adulting, living the kind of life that their parents wanted for them. TU: This felt like I finally, like, make it - you know? - like, the American dream, as cliche as it sounds. CHANG: But that dream did not last long. Early last month, Tu got an email. Meta was eliminating 13% of its workforce, 11,000 positions, and Tu's was one of them. TU: I didn't have time to, like, really process, to be honest. I just kind of, like, on spiral. CHANG: Losing a job is always hard, but for Tu, it's worse. They're allowed to work in the U. S. through a program called OPT. It allows them to stay in the country only as long as they are employed. There's only a 90-day grace period for employees who are laid off. So if Tu hasn't locked down a job by February 7, they may be forced to leave the country. TU: For the first two weeks, I wake up every day, and I just feel like - it feels surreal. Like, is this reality, or is it a nightmare? CHANG: And finding a new job is especially challenging because of what is going on in the tech industry right now. Nearly 150,000 tech workers have been laid off this year, according to the tracking site layoffs. fyi. More than a third of those cuts happened between November and now. That means there is a lot of competition now for any job that Tu might apply for. TU: Competing with that market is crazy because right now it's, like, flipped, right? Like, usually it's, like, usually more opportunity than the talent pool. But now the talent pool is more than the job market. CHANG: Tu says they have already applied for 80 jobs, and they know they can't be picky. TU: I definitely have to settle a lot. I'm not even thinking about a salary. CHANG: Tu hasn't even told their parents about the layoff. They're older, and Tu doesn't want to stress them out. In fact, this all unfolded so quickly that Tu never told their parents about their job at Meta at all. TU: Actually, they don't even know that I worked for Meta. I was going to surprise them. I'll just say that to them, that I work for a startup. CHANG: Tu was planning on telling them during a long-planned trip to Vietnam for the Lunar New Year next month. But that trip won't be happening now because Tu can't afford to pause the job hunt. CONSIDER THIS - after a deluge of tech layoffs, many immigrants are in the same position as Tu. We'll hear about what's next for them and what the tech downturn means for the broader U. S. economy. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)CHANG: From NPR, I'm Ailsa Chang. It's Monday, December 12. It's CONSIDER THIS FROM NPR. For years, the tech industry has been in one long, virtually uninterrupted boom. But that's changed now. Here's Richard Lawler, a senior news editor at The Verge. RICHARD LAWLER: Where in years before in tech, it was very popular to be the company that was talking about, OK, we're spending, and we're investing, and we're growing, and we're talking about how much our customer base is growing, now they want to talk about how profitable they are. And cutting costs is a part of that. CHANG: And a big part of cutting costs has been cutting jobs. Tech workers used to be so sought after that they could command incredible benefits packages, high salaries, crazy perks. But now. . . LAWLER: Those things have dried up, and it's changed. And they are employees and are being treated similar to what we've seen in other industries, where they're being treated as disposable, whereas before, they were treated as stars. CHANG: And there are signs that this could be the new norm. Nick Bunker is the head of economic research at the recruiting website Indeed. NICK BUNKER: One thing that has stood out to me is that in addition to, say, marketing roles and some engineering positions, lots of recruiters have been let go as well, which suggests that the demand to hire more in the future is really going down because you let go of the people who do the hiring when you have no plans to ramp up hiring anytime soon. CHANG: Bunker and Lawler were speaking on the public radio show 1A. You can find a link to that full segment in our episode notes. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)CHANG: According to the American Immigration Council, foreign-born employees represent nearly a quarter of the STEM workforce in the U. S. Not all of them depend on work visas, but for those who do, a slow job market can be especially excruciating. NPR's Stacey Vanek Smith has been looking into what this round of layoffs means for these workers. She brought us Huy Tu's story, which we heard at the top. And as Stacey reports, there are a lot of tech workers in a similar situation. STACEY VANEK SMITH, BYLINE: Back in March of 2020, Aditya Tayade (ph) was working at a tech company near Boston. Things were going well. He'd just gotten a promotion. But COVID and lockdown hit his employer hard. The office was closed down. The company called a virtual all-staff meeting, and Tayade had a bad feeling. Almost immediately, the CEO confirmed his worst fears. ADITYA TAYADE: Saying that they are taking a decision to let people go and the people who are being let go will get an email within the next hour. VANEK SMITH: Tayade was in his living room glued to his computer, refreshing his email again and again. And then, all the sudden, there it was - the email. TAYADE: I don't remember the subject line, but it just started that if you're getting this email, that means you're one of the thousand employees who are being let go. And these are the next steps you need to take. VANEK SMITH: What did you do when you read that? TAYADE: I had a very shaky voice when I told this to my wife. I then went to the bathroom, and I cried. VANEK SMITH: Tayade and his wife are from India. They had been in the U. S. for five years. Their life was here. But Tayade was in the U. S. on an H-1B or skilled worker visa. Tech companies use these visas a lot to find workers they say they cannot find in the U. S. The H-1B visa ties a worker to a particular job. And if they lose that job, a countdown clock starts. Tayade got his emotions together and immediately started making a plan. TAYADE: Let me take out this emotion and then think of it strategically like, this is happening. So I have two months. VANEK SMITH: Two months. People who lose their job on an H-1B visa have 60 days to lock down a new job before they have to leave the country. Right now thousands of H-1B visa holders are facing this same ticking clock. Joshua Browder is the CEO of DoNotPay, an AI-based legal services startup. He says it's always been such a struggle to find talent. He's had to pay recruiters to find people. So after he heard the news about Meta's thousands of layoffs, he sent out a quick note on Twitter. JOSHUA BROWDER: If you have recently been laid off and hold an H-1B visa, we would love to chat with you at DoNotPay. Twenty-five percent of our team are not U. S. citizens, and we can move quickly. VANEK SMITH: Browder thought, maybe I'll get a few really top people who've been laid off - kind of a win-win. BROWDER: We've had hundreds of people reach out. Some of the best designers, engineers with amazing portfolios reached out. And it's very surprising that they were laid off. VANEK SMITH: Browder is an immigrant himself and says H-1B workers are in a really tough spot. There's a flood of tech workers on the market right now and a lot of hiring freezes. Also, many places will hire a U. S. citizen over an H-1B worker. It's cheaper, less paperwork. Aditya Tayade was up against this himself when he was laid off back in 2020. He started applying to every possible job, obsessing over every question in every interview. TAYADE: There was a lot of overthinking, I think, at that point because I was like, I need to answer all the questions correctly. What if I answer one question incorrectly and that is what decides my future in the States? VANEK SMITH: Tayade was applying around the clock. Sometimes he would do five interviews in one day. First round, second round - it was a blur until one day he got a job offer on email. What - how did you feel when you saw that email? TAYADE: I think I was bursting in tears of laughter. It's like one email changed my life. And this other one has changed my trajectory again. VANEK SMITH: Tayade got the job with just 15 days to spare. Now he's trying to help H-1B holders who are in the same situation he was in two years ago, trying desperately to find a job with the clock ticking. CHANG: That was NPR's Stacey Vanek Smith. Now, clearly things are really tough for tech workers right now, but jobs numbers in the overall economy are actually pretty strong. And we wanted to know why that was and whether those tech layoffs could be a sign of trouble for other industries. To find out more about this, I talked with Betsey Stevenson. She's a labor economist at the University of Michigan and served in the Obama administration. OK. So I want to start with the layoffs in the tech sector. Do you think those are indicative of a sector that is struggling right now, or is there something else going on here? BETSEY STEVENSON: I do not think it's indicative of a sector that's struggling. I think it's indicative of a sector that had gangbuster growth over the last couple years and maybe got a bit ahead of its skis thinking that that growth was going to go on at that rate - sort of unstoppable rate and maybe overhired in some areas. We've got sectors that have been slower to recover, like leisure and hospitality or education and health services. So I think you want to think of this as a story of two parts of the economy - one part that recovered very fast out of the pandemic and maybe got a little bit ahead of itself in its time to pause, and then we've got other parts of the economy that were very slow to recover. And we saw real stagnation in any kind of sectors that involved human-to-human contact. CHANG: Well, when it comes to sectors that are still adding jobs at a pretty healthy pace, what specific sectors are we talking about that are still trying to fill positions? STEVENSON: The two big buckets. It's leisure and hospitality and education and health. CHANG: OK. STEVENSON: And that's what made up two-thirds of the job growth that we saw last month, that we saw the previous month. These - it's not surprising for those sectors to have such strong growth. That's what they were doing prior to the pandemic. But they were very slow to come out. You know, we're still missing nearly a million workers in leisure and hospitality. And you want to drill down into occupations. We all know about the nurse shortage. So, you know, it's interesting to me that at the same time we're seeing a lot of news stories about, oh, look at these layoffs at CNN, or, let's look at these layoffs in the tech sector, this is happening in the same few weeks that we've got a nurse calling 911 in an emergency room because she can't handle the patients. CHANG: Yeah. OK. Well, since we always love asking economists crystal ball questions, how do you see this all playing out as you look ahead into 2023? STEVENSON: You know, I'm an optimist. And I think that what we are learning is everything the government did to support workers during the pandemic, even conceding that that might have contributed somewhat to the inflation we're experiencing, I think still ultimately left us with a stronger economy because people have gone back to work. And I think we're going to continue to see very high rates of employment. I think we're still going to continue to see very low rates of unemployment, even if they go up a little bit. And I think we're going to see some continued adjustment, probably away from the goods-producing sector and towards the service sector as we bring back health care workers, restaurant workers, hotel workers.

CHANG: Tu says they have already applied for 80 jobs, and they know they can't be picky. TU: I definitely have to settle a lot. I'm not even thinking about a salary. CHANG: Tu hasn't even told their parents about the layoff. They're older, and Tu doesn't want to stress them out. In fact, this all unfolded so quickly that Tu never told their parents about their job at Meta at all. TU: Actually, they don't even know that I worked for Meta. I was going to surprise them. I'll just say that to them, that I work for a startup. CHANG: Tu was planning on telling them during a long-planned trip to Vietnam for the Lunar New Year next month. But that trip won't be happening now because Tu can't afford to pause the job hunt. CONSIDER THIS - after a deluge of tech layoffs, many immigrants are in the same position as Tu. We'll hear about what's next for them and what the tech downturn means for the broader U. S. economy. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) CHANG: From NPR, I'm Ailsa Chang. It's Monday, December 12. It's CONSIDER THIS FROM NPR. For years, the tech industry has been in one long, virtually uninterrupted boom. But that's changed now. Here's Richard Lawler, a senior news editor at The Verge. RICHARD LAWLER: Where in years before in tech, it was very popular to be the company that was talking about, OK, we're spending, and we're investing, and we're growing, and we're talking about how much our customer base is growing, now they want to talk about how profitable they are. And cutting costs is a part of that. CHANG: And a big part of cutting costs has been cutting jobs. Tech workers used to be so sought after that they could command incredible benefits packages, high salaries, crazy perks. But now. . . LAWLER: Those things have dried up, and it's changed. And they are employees and are being treated similar to what we've seen in other industries, where they're being treated as disposable, whereas before, they were treated as stars. CHANG: And there are signs that this could be the new norm. Nick Bunker is the head of economic research at the recruiting website Indeed. NICK BUNKER: One thing that has stood out to me is that in addition to, say, marketing roles and some engineering positions, lots of recruiters have been let go as well, which suggests that the demand to hire more in the future is really going down because you let go of the people who do the hiring when you have no plans to ramp up hiring anytime soon. CHANG: Bunker and Lawler were speaking on the public radio show 1A. You can find a link to that full segment in our episode notes. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) CHANG: According to the American Immigration Council, foreign-born employees represent nearly a quarter of the STEM workforce in the U. S. Not all of them depend on work visas, but for those who do, a slow job market can be especially excruciating. NPR's Stacey Vanek Smith has been looking into what this round of layoffs means for these workers. She brought us Huy Tu's story, which we heard at the top. And as Stacey reports, there are a lot of tech workers in a similar situation. STACEY VANEK SMITH, BYLINE: Back in March of 2020, Aditya Tayade (ph) was working at a tech company near Boston. Things were going well. He'd just gotten a promotion. But COVID and lockdown hit his employer hard. The office was closed down. The company called a virtual all-staff meeting, and Tayade had a bad feeling. Almost immediately, the CEO confirmed his worst fears. ADITYA TAYADE: Saying that they are taking a decision to let people go and the people who are being let go will get an email within the next hour. VANEK SMITH: Tayade was in his living room glued to his computer, refreshing his email again and again. And then, all the sudden, there it was - the email. TAYADE: I don't remember the subject line, but it just started that if you're getting this email, that means you're one of the thousand employees who are being let go. And these are the next steps you need to take. VANEK SMITH: What did you do when you read that? TAYADE: I had a very shaky voice when I told this to my wife. I then went to the bathroom, and I cried. VANEK SMITH: Tayade and his wife are from India. They had been in the U. S. for five years. Their life was here. But Tayade was in the U. S. on an H-1B or skilled worker visa. Tech companies use these visas a lot to find workers they say they cannot find in the U. S. The H-1B visa ties a worker to a particular job. And if they lose that job, a countdown clock starts. Tayade got his emotions together and immediately started making a plan. TAYADE: Let me take out this emotion and then think of it strategically like, this is happening. So I have two months. VANEK SMITH: Two months. People who lose their job on an H-1B visa have 60 days to lock down a new job before they have to leave the country. Right now thousands of H-1B visa holders are facing this same ticking clock. Joshua Browder is the CEO of DoNotPay, an AI-based legal services startup. He says it's always been such a struggle to find talent. He's had to pay recruiters to find people. So after he heard the news about Meta's thousands of layoffs, he sent out a quick note on Twitter. JOSHUA BROWDER: If you have recently been laid off and hold an H-1B visa, we would love to chat with you at DoNotPay. Twenty-five percent of our team are not U. S. citizens, and we can move quickly. VANEK SMITH: Browder thought, maybe I'll get a few really top people who've been laid off - kind of a win-win. BROWDER: We've had hundreds of people reach out. Some of the best designers, engineers with amazing portfolios reached out. And it's very surprising that they were laid off. VANEK SMITH: Browder is an immigrant himself and says H-1B workers are in a really tough spot. There's a flood of tech workers on the market right now and a lot of hiring freezes. Also, many places will hire a U. S. citizen over an H-1B worker. It's cheaper, less paperwork. Aditya Tayade was up against this himself when he was laid off back in 2020. He started applying to every possible job, obsessing over every question in every interview. TAYADE: There was a lot of overthinking, I think, at that point because I was like, I need to answer all the questions correctly. What if I answer one question incorrectly and that is what decides my future in the States? VANEK SMITH: Tayade was applying around the clock. Sometimes he would do five interviews in one day. First round, second round - it was a blur until one day he got a job offer on email. What - how did you feel when you saw that email? TAYADE: I think I was bursting in tears of laughter. It's like one email changed my life. And this other one has changed my trajectory again. VANEK SMITH: Tayade got the job with just 15 days to spare. Now he's trying to help H-1B holders who are in the same situation he was in two years ago, trying desperately to find a job with the clock ticking. CHANG: That was NPR's Stacey Vanek Smith. Now, clearly things are really tough for tech workers right now, but jobs numbers in the overall economy are actually pretty strong. And we wanted to know why that was and whether those tech layoffs could be a sign of trouble for other industries. To find out more about this, I talked with Betsey Stevenson. She's a labor economist at the University of Michigan and served in the Obama administration. OK. So I want to start with the layoffs in the tech sector. Do you think those are indicative of a sector that is struggling right now, or is there something else going on here? BETSEY STEVENSON: I do not think it's indicative of a sector that's struggling. I think it's indicative of a sector that had gangbuster growth over the last couple years and maybe got a bit ahead of its skis thinking that that growth was going to go on at that rate - sort of unstoppable rate and maybe overhired in some areas. We've got sectors that have been slower to recover, like leisure and hospitality or education and health services. So I think you want to think of this as a story of two parts of the economy - one part that recovered very fast out of the pandemic and maybe got a little bit ahead of itself in its time to pause, and then we've got other parts of the economy that were very slow to recover. And we saw real stagnation in any kind of sectors that involved human-to-human contact. CHANG: Well, when it comes to sectors that are still adding jobs at a pretty healthy pace, what specific sectors are we talking about that are still trying to fill positions? STEVENSON: The two big buckets. It's leisure and hospitality and education and health. CHANG: OK. STEVENSON: And that's what made up two-thirds of the job growth that we saw last month, that we saw the previous month. These - it's not surprising for those sectors to have such strong growth. That's what they were doing prior to the pandemic. But they were very slow to come out. You know, we're still missing nearly a million workers in leisure and hospitality. And you want to drill down into occupations. We all know about the nurse shortage. So, you know, it's interesting to me that at the same time we're seeing a lot of news stories about, oh, look at these layoffs at CNN, or, let's look at these layoffs in the tech sector, this is happening in the same few weeks that we've got a nurse calling 911 in an emergency room because she can't handle the patients. CHANG: Yeah. OK. Well, since we always love asking economists crystal ball questions, how do you see this all playing out as you look ahead into 2023? STEVENSON: You know, I'm an optimist. And I think that what we are learning is everything the government did to support workers during the pandemic, even conceding that that might have contributed somewhat to the inflation we're experiencing, I think still ultimately left us with a stronger economy because people have gone back to work. And I think we're going to continue to see very high rates of employment. I think we're still going to continue to see very low rates of unemployment, even if they go up a little bit. And I think we're going to see some continued adjustment, probably away from the goods-producing sector and towards the service sector as we bring back health care workers, restaurant workers, hotel workers.

He released internal documents to a handpicked group of journalists who have been digging through them and posting excerpts on Twitter. But is this corporate transparency or just the latest attention-grabbing stunt by the billionaire CEO? NPR correspondent Shannon Bond joins us. Shannon, OK, for listeners who might not be familiar, what are the Twitter Files? SHANNON BOND, BYLINE: Yeah, as you said, they're internal documents. These are emails and Slack chats. And they show Twitter employees, most of whom are no longer at the company, discussing the company's policies and some of these really fraught calls they've had to make in recent years, including the decision to ban then-President Donald Trump after the January 6 Capitol attack, as well as some details about how Twitter limits the reach of some users, including well-known right wing accounts that have broken its rules. Now, many Republicans have long claimed they are being censored on social media, even though Twitter's own internal research has found its algorithms favor right-leaning political content. And so Musk and those that he's given access to have framed these documents as this bombshell, as proof that Twitter has, in fact, intentionally suppressed conservatives for politically motivated reasons. MART\u00cdNEZ: All right, Shannon. So now that we have a peek behind the Twitter curtain, what's new to you? BOND: Well, you know, I've covered social media for a while. And this is, you know, an interesting look inside these high-stakes, controversial moderation processes. But it's not a bombshell. I mean, take Twitter's decision in 2020 to briefly block people from sharing a New York Post story based on Hunter Biden's laptop. You know, that was controversial. The company said very publicly later it was a mistake how it had handled this. And these new internal documents - they show Twitter employees struggling with what to do in that case and questioning their own policies. MART\u00cdNEZ: Now, the audience for these files seems to be Elon Musk's conservative supporters. So how are they receiving this. BOND: Yeah, I mean, for many of them, the mere existence of these internal discussions is the smoking gun. And that's certainly how Musk is framing this. And it's quickly gotten quite ugly. You know, Musk is using this project, which purports to be about transparency, in part to harass people he disagrees with. And he's giving his followers easy targets to go after. Over the weekend, he attacked Twitter's former head of safety, Yoel Roth, who features heavily in these documents, as well as Dr. Anthony Fauci. Musk says he will feature in future installments of the Twitter Files. And in both cases, Musk endorsed conspiracy theories and has triggered violent threats against both men. MART\u00cdNEZ: So if Musk is critiquing Twitter's old management, their previous management, what is he doing differently? BOND: Yeah, I mean, that's a good question, right? Because for better or worse, the old Twitter did have a set of policies and processes. And it didn't always follow them, but it did have them. Under Musk, it's really kind of whatever he wants to do. You know, he's in control. Just yesterday, he dissolved the company's Trust and Safety Council, this outside advisory group. At the same time, he's endorsed some existing policies that the Twitter Files have cast as censorship, like limiting the visibility of tweets that break the rules. And he's also reinstated thousands of accounts that had been banned for breaking the rules, including former President Trump, as well as neo-Nazis and white nationalists and QAnon promoters. At the same time, he says he won't let Alex Jones, the conspiracy theorist, or Kanye West, back on the platform. But instead of talking about any of these decisions Musk is making now, we're talking about what Twitter did a couple years back. And for me, that's the biggest takeaway. Musk is using Twitter to get people talking about Twitter on Twitter. MART\u00cdNEZ: NPR's Shannon Bond, thanks a lot. BOND: Thanks, A.

Today we will be talking about ChatGPT, a powerful tool that can assist with a wide range of tasks, from generating humanlike text to providing helpful answers to questions. We'll be exploring the capabilities of ChatGPT and how it is being used in various industries. In fact, the last two sentences I just read to you were written not by me but by ChatGPT, a bot. A professor at the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania, Ethan Mollick, has also been experimenting with ChatGPT. He joins me now to show me how ChatGPT works. Welcome. ETHAN MOLLICK: Thank you. I'm glad to be here. SCHMITZ: So, Ethan, I was exposed to ChatGPT when I was hanging out with some friends this weekend, and we were talking about this very interview. And suddenly, the heads of all the teenagers in the room popped up, and they said, oh, we have that on our cellphones. This apparently is a thing among teenagers. MOLLICK: It is, I think, a universal thing. Very quickly, there's a sort of TikTok fun phenomenon. But also, I would challenge you to find a single school where there are not a large number of people using this in their classes, whether the teachers know it or not. SCHMITZ: And how do they typically use it? MOLLICK: I mean, there's a few things, right? So the most obvious thing and the thing people come away with if they play with ChatGPT for just a few minutes is, wow, I can cheat on essays with this thing. And then if they spend a couple more minutes, they say, well, I can cheat on creating software code or translating language. But the uses actually go way beyond that, and I've been amazed by what some of my students have been reporting about how they're using the capabilities. SCHMITZ: Well, explain that a little. What other noncheating uses can it offer us? MOLLICK: Well, I mean, so many. But just on the education side, you can actually use it to - you can paste in an essay and ask it to correct it. You can paste in entire academic papers and ask it to summarize it. You can ask it to find an error in your code and correct it and tell you why you got it wrong. It really is this general companion for all kinds of purposes. SCHMITZ: So I now have ChatGPT opened up in front of me on a laptop. Can you walk me through this? How do I use this? MOLLICK: So the best way to think about this is you are chatting with a omniscient, eager-to-please intern who sometimes lies to you. SCHMITZ: (Laughter). MOLLICK: And if you sort of take that approach, you're going to be in great shape. SCHMITZ: All right. MOLLICK: Let's have it describe something or explain something to us. What's something that you're interested in that we can have it write an essay to us about? And then let's play with that a little bit. SCHMITZ: Well, I'm in public radio, so maybe a story, a radio story? MOLLICK: Sure. Pick a topic. SCHMITZ: Let's talk about frogs. MOLLICK: Great. Why don't we say, create an NPR story about frogs? SCHMITZ: Can you create an NPR story about frogs? MOLLICK: Perfect. SCHMITZ: Title - \"The Fascinating World Of Frogs. \" (Reading) As anyone who has visited a pond or marsh on a warm summer evening can attest, frogs are a common and fascinating part of our natural world. These amphibians, which belong to the order Anura, are known for their distinctive croaking calls and their ability to hop and swim with ease. It just goes on and on. It's talking about a giant goliath frog. It's talking about tiny frogs that are the size of your fingernail. MOLLICK: Yeah, this is a little long. Why don't you actually just have it do it as a rhyming poem instead? So just say, can you do this as a rhyming poem? SCHMITZ: Yeah. Can you write this as a rhyming poem? Here we go. (Reading) In ponds and marshes on a warm summer night, you'll hear the croaks of frogs, a common sight. They belong to the order Anura, you see, with a unique life cycle for you and me. I was expecting a little more from ChatGPT, to be honest. I - so, OK, I'm starting to understand both the curiosity of this as well as the limitations of this. How have you used ChatGPT? MOLLICK: So in education, I actually tried to figure out how much I could automate my job. And I'm a professor of entrepreneurship at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. I teach MBAs. So I asked it to create an MBA syllabus. And. . . SCHMITZ: Wait. You asked ChatGPT to create an MBA syllabus? MOLLICK: Absolutely. I mean, it created a pretty good syllabus for an MBA class. And then I said, OK, well, that's interesting. Could you create a final assignment for that class? It gave me the final assignment - again, a really nice business plan assignment. Can you give me the grading rubric for it? It broke down the grading and gave me a table of points. I said, could you give me the beginning of the second lecture that I would have to give in this MBA syllabus? And it wrote me the lecture. It's this multiplier of ability that I think we are not quite getting our heads around that is absolutely stunning. SCHMITZ: When we started this conversation, we started talking about how the - you know, some of the first users are teenagers because they use it to cheat on essays. What are some of the concerns and ethical implications that this calls into question? MOLLICK: I think we are just barely starting to get our hands around this. You know, is it ethical to have the AI write you a draft that you modify? Is it ethical for you to paste in text and ask it to improve it? You add in the other aspect - it's frequently wrong or lies with complete confidence. How do we work with that piece? So I think we don't understand what the implications of this are yet, and I think they're much more profound than people are thinking. It's going to replace all of us. So just be ready for that. SCHMITZ: Really? Is this really going to replace all of us? MOLLICK: I don't think anyone knows what the future really holds. There's two options, right? Option 1 is it multiplies your ability to do work because you can have it do 10 drafts of a story and keep the stuff you like. So in the best version of the world, you are out there, and you're going to use this to multiply your work 10 or 12 times. And I already hear people doing this all the time. They're using it to create bios, agendas - whatever you want - write letters. SCHMITZ: Sure. But, I mean, you're saying multiply your work, but at the same time, I can also foresee something like this, if it has a little more accuracy, to actually take people's jobs. It could report on news, and you wouldn't know whether it's factual or not. MOLLICK: Absolutely. I - actually, I was just interviewed on a television station live, where it turns out all the questions were asked by ChatGPT, and I didn't know it. They sounded great. This is what I mean. I actually think that there is sort of a dawning realization you have when you play with this, which is what do we do? So I was giving you the upside case. The upside case is it multiplies your capabilities and intelligence a hundred times. The downside is how many of us do we need? And I don't have answers to those questions. SCHMITZ: Ethan Mollick is a professor at the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania. Ethan, thank you. MOLLICK: Excellent. Thanks for having me. ROB SCHMITZ, HOST:   Has artificial intelligence reached the point where a software program can do better work than you? Today we will be talking about ChatGPT, a powerful tool that can assist with a wide range of tasks, from generating humanlike text to providing helpful answers to questions. We'll be exploring the capabilities of ChatGPT and how it is being used in various industries. In fact, the last two sentences I just read to you were written not by me but by ChatGPT, a bot. A professor at the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania, Ethan Mollick, has also been experimenting with ChatGPT. He joins me now to show me how ChatGPT works. Welcome. ETHAN MOLLICK: Thank you. I'm glad to be here. SCHMITZ: So, Ethan, I was exposed to ChatGPT when I was hanging out with some friends this weekend, and we were talking about this very interview. And suddenly, the heads of all the teenagers in the room popped up, and they said, oh, we have that on our cellphones. This apparently is a thing among teenagers. MOLLICK: It is, I think, a universal thing. Very quickly, there's a sort of TikTok fun phenomenon. But also, I would challenge you to find a single school where there are not a large number of people using this in their classes, whether the teachers know it or not. SCHMITZ: And how do they typically use it? MOLLICK: I mean, there's a few things, right? So the most obvious thing and the thing people come away with if they play with ChatGPT for just a few minutes is, wow, I can cheat on essays with this thing. And then if they spend a couple more minutes, they say, well, I can cheat on creating software code or translating language. But the uses actually go way beyond that, and I've been amazed by what some of my students have been reporting about how they're using the capabilities. SCHMITZ: Well, explain that a little. What other noncheating uses can it offer us? MOLLICK: Well, I mean, so many. But just on the education side, you can actually use it to - you can paste in an essay and ask it to correct it. You can paste in entire academic papers and ask it to summarize it. You can ask it to find an error in your code and correct it and tell you why you got it wrong. It really is this general companion for all kinds of purposes. SCHMITZ: So I now have ChatGPT opened up in front of me on a laptop. Can you walk me through this? How do I use this? MOLLICK: So the best way to think about this is you are chatting with a omniscient, eager-to-please intern who sometimes lies to you. SCHMITZ: (Laughter). MOLLICK: And if you sort of take that approach, you're going to be in great shape. SCHMITZ: All right. MOLLICK: Let's have it describe something or explain something to us. What's something that you're interested in that we can have it write an essay to us about? And then let's play with that a little bit. SCHMITZ: Well, I'm in public radio, so maybe a story, a radio story? MOLLICK: Sure. Pick a topic. SCHMITZ: Let's talk about frogs. MOLLICK: Great. Why don't we say, create an NPR story about frogs? SCHMITZ: Can you create an NPR story about frogs? MOLLICK: Perfect. SCHMITZ: Title - \"The Fascinating World Of Frogs. \" (Reading) As anyone who has visited a pond or marsh on a warm summer evening can attest, frogs are a common and fascinating part of our natural world. These amphibians, which belong to the order Anura, are known for their distinctive croaking calls and their ability to hop and swim with ease. It just goes on and on. It's talking about a giant goliath frog. It's talking about tiny frogs that are the size of your fingernail. MOLLICK: Yeah, this is a little long. Why don't you actually just have it do it as a rhyming poem instead? So just say, can you do this as a rhyming poem? SCHMITZ: Yeah. Can you write this as a rhyming poem? Here we go. (Reading) In ponds and marshes on a warm summer night, you'll hear the croaks of frogs, a common sight. They belong to the order Anura, you see, with a unique life cycle for you and me. I was expecting a little more from ChatGPT, to be honest. I - so, OK, I'm starting to understand both the curiosity of this as well as the limitations of this. How have you used ChatGPT? MOLLICK: So in education, I actually tried to figure out how much I could automate my job. And I'm a professor of entrepreneurship at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. I teach MBAs. So I asked it to create an MBA syllabus. And. . . SCHMITZ: Wait. You asked ChatGPT to create an MBA syllabus? MOLLICK: Absolutely. I mean, it created a pretty good syllabus for an MBA class. And then I said, OK, well, that's interesting. Could you create a final assignment for that class? It gave me the final assignment - again, a really nice business plan assignment. Can you give me the grading rubric for it? It broke down the grading and gave me a table of points. I said, could you give me the beginning of the second lecture that I would have to give in this MBA syllabus? And it wrote me the lecture. It's this multiplier of ability that I think we are not quite getting our heads around that is absolutely stunning. SCHMITZ: When we started this conversation, we started talking about how the - you know, some of the first users are teenagers because they use it to cheat on essays. What are some of the concerns and ethical implications that this calls into question? MOLLICK: I think we are just barely starting to get our hands around this. You know, is it ethical to have the AI write you a draft that you modify? Is it ethical for you to paste in text and ask it to improve it? You add in the other aspect - it's frequently wrong or lies with complete confidence. How do we work with that piece? So I think we don't understand what the implications of this are yet, and I think they're much more profound than people are thinking. It's going to replace all of us. So just be ready for that. SCHMITZ: Really? Is this really going to replace all of us? MOLLICK: I don't think anyone knows what the future really holds. There's two options, right? Option 1 is it multiplies your ability to do work because you can have it do 10 drafts of a story and keep the stuff you like. So in the best version of the world, you are out there, and you're going to use this to multiply your work 10 or 12 times. And I already hear people doing this all the time.

You will remember that Musk, the tech billionaire, finalized his purchase of the social media platform in October and since then has made a lot of dramatic moves, including dissolving the board, firing top executives and thousands of staff and reinstating people previously banned for bad behavior. But earlier this week, Musk was the one doing the banning. First, he banned @ElonJet, a Twitter account run by a college student that shared the whereabouts of his private jet using publicly available information. Then he suspended the accounts of a number of journalists, including from prominent outlets like CNN and The New York Times, that had covered that story or who had previously covered his business decisions on the dubious grounds that the journalist violated Twitter's rules on doxing, which refers to sharing personal information such as someone's home address. Those bans were sharply criticized by officials in the U. S. , Europe and even the U. N. But earlier today, Musk reinstated a number of those accounts, apparently based on the results of a poll posted to his Twitter account. It was another reminder not just of Musk's idiosyncratic decision making but also of Twitter's outsized role as a tool for journalists and officials in getting information to the public. So we wanted to talk about that with someone who's been thinking a lot about that. So we called Joan Donovan. She's the research director of the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy at the Harvard Kennedy School, and she's with us now. Professor Donovan, welcome. Thank you so much for joining us. JOAN DONOVAN: Great to be here. MARTIN: So I just wanted to start by getting your reaction to these latest developments, Elon Musk reinstating the accounts of some of the journalists who were banned on Thursday. Now, remembering that he said the bans were necessary because this information was putting his personal safety and that of his family at risk - but then he says he reversed himself based on a poll he posted to his Twitter account, where nearly 60% of the people who responded said that they should have those accounts reinstated. I just wanted to ask, as briefly as you can, what do you make of all that? DONOVAN: Well, Musk's brand seems to be reactionary decision making. And with the ElonJet account, these reporters were reporting on that account. So it was not the case that they were sharing information that wasn't in the public interest but that this account had been singled out before by Musk as a problem. And what triggered Musk in banning everybody that was sharing news about this account was an altercation that happened. Seemingly, someone had targeted one of his cars that one of his children were in the day before. And so - but that's a convoluted way around of saying that Musk was reacting to what a lot of these journalists deal with every day, which is people trying to find personal information about them and then potential threats that come from it. And so when he targeted the journalists that were reporting on him, it did raise quite a bit of concern, not just within the journalist ecosystem but also public officials and academics because they weren't really aware of how much direct control Elon was going to exercise over the platform. And now we know that content moderation is going to be subject to his whims. MARTIN: On Thursday evening, you actually were hosting a Twitter Space with some of the journalists who had been banned, and then Elon Musk popped into it. Could you just tell us a little bit about what happened during the meeting? People can listen to it themselves on your feed, but is there anything you took away from that meeting? Is there anything in particular that stood out to you? DONOVAN: There's this glitch that essentially, even if you are a banned account, you can still join Spaces. And so we had Matt Binder and Drew Harwell, both who had been banned earlier that night, in the chat when Elon's friend shows up and then when Elon showed up, maybe about 10 minutes later. Elon primarily just said that journalists are no longer going to be treated like a protected class on Twitter. They're going to be treated like the same as everybody else in that if you dox someone, you get suspended. And the choice to draw the line on doxing is a really interesting one, I think, because of the way journalists have had to deal with this over the years of using Twitter and other public platforms in order to protect themselves and their family. And the way the conversation evolved, essentially, was that Drew Harwell was able to ask a question to Elon about the suspension and about the ElonJet account. And Elon stuck to this line of if you dox someone, you get suspended. And then he hung up. And then about 15 or 20 minutes later, the screen went black, and Spaces was shut down for the entire site, which goes to show how much control he exercises over the entire communal space. And I, you know, encourage people to think less about social media as public space and more about it like how you would behave inside, you know, a fast food chain. You know, there are managers. There are people watching. There's codes of conduct. And unfortunately, with the way that Musk is targeting particular mainstream journalists, I think we're going to see more of these shenanigans and not less over the next couple of months. MARTIN: I take it that you have a concern that because of the increased reliance on Twitter by, you know - obviously not by everybody. I mean, people say this all the time. Twitter's not the real world. But it has become a - really embedded in journalistic practice, in disseminating information. It's - you know, government officials rely on it to let people know things that they think they need to know in real time. So I think do you have a concern that this reliance on this particular mechanism is making it easier for certain individuals and groups to manipulate and shape the public conversation? DONOVAN: So recently, I published a book called \"Meme Wars\" with co-authors Emily Dreyfuss and Brian Friedberg. And in that book, what we try to show is that memes online, which we all feel are jokes and are fun ways of moving information around and poking fun at things, pointing out contradictions - the - and memes are starting to have a really important impact on how our politicians communicate, how celebrities communicate. As well, journalists - the way in which journalists are starting to understand information campaigns online is through hashtags and other slogans. And so when we look at the rise in disinformation, it was impossible to subtract that from the changes in internet communication and the usefulness of these short, quippy images and slogans. But where Musk fits into this is really interesting and something that I want to explore more and research because Musk - he often talks in this coded language. He, you know, will say things like nothing burger, and it's not necessarily the kind of language befitting of a CEO. He also will talk about NPCs, which, in meme language, is nonplaying characters, which are essentially this idea that the right has that the left are carrying out the status quo and can't think for themselves. And so as we start to think about, well, what is the future of the internet, and what are the ways in which our communication channels are going to be challenged and controlled, it's really important for us to understand that there are so many things changing about our culture all at once. Journalism especially is important here because of the way that Twitter has become the assigning editor for many newsrooms. And so whether journalists like it or not, they're going to have to reckon with Musk and the changing nature of political communication so that they can do their jobs. And unfortunately, until there's a technological rival to Twitter and the right kind of regulatory conditions that would make a space for news online, we're kind of stuck with what we have right now. MARTIN: That was Joan Donovan, research director of the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy at Harvard University, and she's co-author of the book \"Meme Wars: The Untold Story Of The Online Battles Upending Democracy In America. \" Professor Donovan, thanks so much for sharing this expertise with us.

But a recent piece in Foreign Affairs outlines a terrifying new trend that could thwart movements like this - the use of spyware to track individuals. And it's not just autocratic regimes. According to political scientist Ronald Deibert, democratic countries are beginning to rely on this software, too. And because this technology is largely unregulated, he argues that's likely to get worse. Deibert directs the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto. His group tracks cyberespionage around the world. NPR's Michel Martin sat down with him to talk about his piece in Foreign Affairs, which is entitled \"The Autocrat In Your iPhone: How Mercenary Spyware Threatens Democracy. \" And he began by explaining why this software is becoming more common as a way to track dissent around the world. RONALD DEIBERT: The industry that we're describing here has evolved over the last decade, I would say, and it's kind of paralleled the rise of digital technology and consumer applications and especially the move towards always-on, always-connected mobile devices. Most of us carry with us one or more devices at all times, and they're really the focal points of our lives. And as we become more dependent on them and as they become integral to just about everything that's done today, there has been a need that has emerged from principally government security agencies to get inside those devices to find out what people are doing. And over time, the techniques that have been used have evolved, as well, to become far more sophisticated and less easy to detect, especially by the targets themselves. MICHEL MARTIN, BYLINE: But you raise the larger concern that this isn't just about dictators in countries where we know that autocrats already rule. You say this is a threat to kind of liberal democratic order, period, writ large. DEIBERT: That's correct. MARTIN: But I guess the question I have is - because clearly, your warning is not just that this is a technology that dictators are attracted to. You're saying that the lack of regulation makes this attractive to democratic countries. I mean, do we have evidence that democratic countries are using this on their own citizens? DEIBERT: We do, actually. We have a number of cases arising from our research and from other organizations that do similar research like ours of really Watergate-style scandals in places like Spain. We uncovered a massive domestic espionage operation involving this type of spyware directed against Catalan civil society and the Catalan government - Hungary, Poland. Greece is in the midst of a scandal because of the abuse of this type of technology. You know, there is a legitimate use case that you can make. The world is a dangerous place. We need law enforcement to do their job. But if they have this extraordinary great leap forward in sophistication, we need to make sure that there are appropriate checks and balances in place, which, frankly, in most countries, is not the case. MARTIN: But why should individuals care? Because you can imagine where some people would say, I'm not doing anything wrong. I don't care if the government knows what's in my contacts, or I need my government to protect me from terrorists. And therefore, these agencies should be using this however they want. So I'm just going to ask you, why should individuals listening to this conversation care about this? DEIBERT: For two reasons. One is, it is true that we want law enforcement, state agencies to protect us. That's part of their function - public security. But we don't want them to abuse power. In a liberal democracy, you have certain guardrails precisely to prevent the consolidation of power and the abuse of power. And we have certain rights that are usually enshrined in our laws - civil liberties that we need to protect - put in place checks and balances, usually some kind of independent oversight to check to make sure that they're not stepping outside of their appropriate lanes. In terms of individuals, why should you care? I'm not doing anything wrong. Well, the problem is that bad people don't care whether you're innocent. I could spend hours describing one victim after another that we've encountered in our research who is doing absolutely nothing wrong and yet has been spied upon by an autocrat or a corrupt ruler because they want to get access, say, to that person's close relative, who is the principal target. If you look at Jamal Khashoggi, we were able to determine that his fiancee and several of his close colleagues' devices were hacked. Essentially, everyone with whom he was communicating about his activism was under surveillance by Saudi operatives using this type of surveillance technology. Those people - largely innocent. Some of them may have been largely apolitical. So this type of thing can happen when there aren't guardrails in place, especially when you're dealing with such a sophisticated capability as this. A mere push of the button - you can access any phone. It's extraordinarily tempting to have that power in front of you if no one is watching. MARTIN: That was Ronald Deibert, professor of political science at the University of Toronto, where he directs the Citizen Lab. We've been talking about his piece \"The Autocrat In Your iPhone: How Mercenary Spyware Threatens Democracy,\" and it's published in Foreign Affairs. Professor Deibert, thanks so much for joining us today. It's a disturbing conversation, but thanks for sharing this reporting with us. DEIBERT: My pleasure. Thank you for having me.

And because this technology is largely unregulated, he argues that's likely to get worse. Deibert directs the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto. His group tracks cyberespionage around the world. NPR's Michel Martin sat down with him to talk about his piece in Foreign Affairs, which is entitled \"The Autocrat In Your iPhone: How Mercenary Spyware Threatens Democracy. \" And he began by explaining why this software is becoming more common as a way to track dissent around the world. RONALD DEIBERT: The industry that we're describing here has evolved over the last decade, I would say, and it's kind of paralleled the rise of digital technology and consumer applications and especially the move towards always-on, always-connected mobile devices. Most of us carry with us one or more devices at all times, and they're really the focal points of our lives. And as we become more dependent on them and as they become integral to just about everything that's done today, there has been a need that has emerged from principally government security agencies to get inside those devices to find out what people are doing. And over time, the techniques that have been used have evolved, as well, to become far more sophisticated and less easy to detect, especially by the targets themselves. MICHEL MARTIN, BYLINE: But you raise the larger concern that this isn't just about dictators in countries where we know that autocrats already rule. You say this is a threat to kind of liberal democratic order, period, writ large. DEIBERT: That's correct. MARTIN: But I guess the question I have is - because clearly, your warning is not just that this is a technology that dictators are attracted to. You're saying that the lack of regulation makes this attractive to democratic countries. I mean, do we have evidence that democratic countries are using this on their own citizens? DEIBERT: We do, actually. We have a number of cases arising from our research and from other organizations that do similar research like ours of really Watergate-style scandals in places like Spain. We uncovered a massive domestic espionage operation involving this type of spyware directed against Catalan civil society and the Catalan government - Hungary, Poland. Greece is in the midst of a scandal because of the abuse of this type of technology. You know, there is a legitimate use case that you can make. The world is a dangerous place. We need law enforcement to do their job. But if they have this extraordinary great leap forward in sophistication, we need to make sure that there are appropriate checks and balances in place, which, frankly, in most countries, is not the case. MARTIN: But why should individuals care? Because you can imagine where some people would say, I'm not doing anything wrong. I don't care if the government knows what's in my contacts, or I need my government to protect me from terrorists. And therefore, these agencies should be using this however they want. So I'm just going to ask you, why should individuals listening to this conversation care about this? DEIBERT: For two reasons. One is, it is true that we want law enforcement, state agencies to protect us. That's part of their function - public security. But we don't want them to abuse power. In a liberal democracy, you have certain guardrails precisely to prevent the consolidation of power and the abuse of power. And we have certain rights that are usually enshrined in our laws - civil liberties that we need to protect - put in place checks and balances, usually some kind of independent oversight to check to make sure that they're not stepping outside of their appropriate lanes. In terms of individuals, why should you care? I'm not doing anything wrong. Well, the problem is that bad people don't care whether you're innocent. I could spend hours describing one victim after another that we've encountered in our research who is doing absolutely nothing wrong and yet has been spied upon by an autocrat or a corrupt ruler because they want to get access, say, to that person's close relative, who is the principal target. If you look at Jamal Khashoggi, we were able to determine that his fiancee and several of his close colleagues' devices were hacked. Essentially, everyone with whom he was communicating about his activism was under surveillance by Saudi operatives using this type of surveillance technology. Those people - largely innocent. Some of them may have been largely apolitical. So this type of thing can happen when there aren't guardrails in place, especially when you're dealing with such a sophisticated capability as this. A mere push of the button - you can access any phone. It's extraordinarily tempting to have that power in front of you if no one is watching. MARTIN: That was Ronald Deibert, professor of political science at the University of Toronto, where he directs the Citizen Lab. We've been talking about his piece \"The Autocrat In Your iPhone: How Mercenary Spyware Threatens Democracy,\" and it's published in Foreign Affairs. Professor Deibert, thanks so much for joining us today. It's a disturbing conversation, but thanks for sharing this reporting with us. DEIBERT: My pleasure.

For the past two months, under Musk, the social media platform has been in a constant state of upheaval. NPR tech reporter Bobby Allyn is here to discuss what may be next for Twitter. Hey, Bobby. BOBBY ALLYN, BYLINE: Hey, Mary Louise. KELLY: So when I say it's been in constant upheaval, I'm not sure there's been a single day since Musk took over that hasn't generated controversy of some sort of another. Why is he announcing now that he plans, eventually, to step aside? ALLYN: That's right. It's been a head-spinning couple months. But a few important things have shifted recently. First, key Silicon Valley supporters of Musk's takeover of Twitter have started to lose faith. And over at another corporation he runs, the electric vehicle company Tesla, investors are becoming impatient. Musk is used to having his fair share of haters. But, you know, when some of his most powerful and influential supporters start to back away, I think Musk listens. He also conducted a poll on Twitter asking his followers if he should step down. It was a bit of a stunt, but a majority of the respondents said yes. KELLY: Do we know what specifically is making these influential, powerful supporters distance themselves? ALLYN: Yeah, he made some policy decisions in recent days that were widely condemned. First, he temporarily suspended the accounts of half a dozen journalists from outlets like The New York Times and CNN. These reporters have written critically of Musk. Some have written or tweeted about a Twitter account that tracked the movement of Musk's private jet, all based on public information, I may add. But Musk didn't like it, so he suspended them. Press freedom advocates were alarmed. The second move that became instantly divisive was Musk announced that linking to competing social media sites would be banned - so no tweets linking to Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter alternative Mastodon. Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey, who has supported Musk, said that didn't make sense. And Paul Graham, who is a prominent venture capitalist, said it was his last straw and that he would be leaving Twitter. Now, Graham has also been a longtime ally of Musk. Musk reversed both of these controversial moves, but, you know, not before some real damage was done here. KELLY: OK, so where do things go next? Do we know who Musk might choose as his replacement? Do we know when? Do we know if he means it? Is he really going? ALLYN: Yeah, all good questions. Musk hasn't named any possible replacement, but longtime observers of Musk say if you look at his other companies, Tesla and rocket company SpaceX, he does tend to tap people from his inner circle to take over executive functions. So that sure does look likely. Now, there's no timeline as to when this might happen, but one thing is certain - it's not going to be an easy job. Morale is low at Twitter. The latest estimates suggest that when you combine layoffs, resignations and others who have left, about 70% of Twitter's staff is now gone. The other thing is Musk would still be the ultimate decider. He still owns Twitter, and all decisions, at the end of the day, will still fall to him. So when Musk says it's going to take some time to find someone foolish enough to take the job, well, Mary Louise, his assessment might really be right there. KELLY: Thank you, Bobby. ALLYN: Thanks, Mary Louise. KELLY: NPR's Bobby Allyn.

Despite higher wages, hotel owners and managers still can't fill positions, so they are having to adapt in all sorts of ways, as NPR's Andrea Hsu reports. ANDREA HSU, BYLINE: In the laundry room at the Country Inn and Suites on the north side of Baltimore, the dryers are humming, rags are soaking, and a 4-year-old boy is happily snacking on some Ritz crackers as he watches his mother fold sheets. DEEPAK PATEL: Yeah. Yeah. HSU: Hello. DEEPAK PATEL: That's her son. HSU: The owners here, Deepak Patel and his wife, Deepa, began allowing staff to bring their children to work last year. Business had picked up at the mid-scale hotel, but they were unable to bring back workers, especially in housekeeping. Child care was a real issue for some staff, and the couple couldn't afford to lose anyone. So they decided. . . DEEPA PATEL: OK. Bring your child here. At least we are finishing the work, you know? HSU: Before the pandemic, the Patels had 25 to 30 people on staff. Now they're down to 14. They've had zero luck hiring this year, even though they've raised wages from about $10 an hour before the pandemic to $16 an hour now. DEEPAK PATEL: Nobody wants to work, actually. And we kind of - we are still surprised at who - where everybody are? HSU: Deepak Patel knows he's competing with the Amazon warehouses nearby and a lot of other employers, too. These days, workers have a lot of choices. There are companies offering technical training and even free college tuition. In the old days, Patel says, lots of people would just walk through the door and fill out a job application - nowadays, no one. So he and his wife have been filling the gaps themselves. DEEPAK PATEL: Since 2020, we haven't had a day off. We come every single day. HSU: They staff the front desk, manage the free breakfast, do room inspections, also laundry. DEEPA PATEL: Unload, load, put it in a dryer, put it in a washer. HSU: It's a whole family affair. Their two girls come every day after school to help out. And still, with just six people in housekeeping taking care of 81 rooms, they cannot offer the level of service they used to. Now they clean rooms only every four days unless a guest requests otherwise. DEEPAK PATEL: Of course, if somebody is here for one night, we definitely want to clean their rooms so we can resell that room to new guests. But if somebody's here for three nights, we don't clean that room until they check out. HSU: Deepak Patel has been thinking hard about whether this business even makes sense anymore. How do you run a 24-hour operation without workers? He's exploring all the options, including one I got to see in New York. MERLE AYERS: So now I'm going to press this button. (SOUNDBITE OF ROBOT WHIRRING)AYERS: Off he goes. HSU: Merle Ayers is director of banquets at the Garden City Hotel on Long Island. He's brought me over to meet the Whiz, a robot vacuum, one of two the hotel bought late last year for roughly $30,000 each. The other one's up in housekeeping. AYERS: So what's happening right now is the Whiz, basically, is following a pre-programmed route, and it's going to complete that route and vacuum the whole rug. HSU: Well, as long as we humans don't get in its way. AYERS: It's trying to figure out where to go right now. You're kind of in its way, too. HSU: The Whiz will clean the red and gold carpet we're standing on in 30 to 40 minutes, about as long as it would take a human to do the same job. But it's not about saving time. It's about saving manpower. AYERS: As you can see, the gentleman I have here - working over here, he's doing something else while this is vacuuming the floor. HSU: Which is key because this hotel, with its gold ceilings and crystal chandeliers, is also short-staffed. Around 15 to 20% of their positions are unfilled. GRADY COLIN: I've been in the hotel business for a very long time, and I've never experienced this. HSU: Grady Colin is managing director here. He's found that since the pandemic, workers want more freedom. They don't want to be tied down to their jobs. So just as the Patels have done in Baltimore, Colin has become very accommodating of the staff. COLIN: We've even tried to fill positions by saying, let's not make it a full-time. Whatever - flexible hours. What hours do you have available? We'll cobble together what would have been a 40-hour shift for one person with three or four. HSU: But what he won't touch - daily room cleanings and nightly turndown service. He says travelers paying four-star hotel rates expect an A-plus experience. COLIN: This hotel is 148 years old. It's always been the dominant, iconic property in its region. The reputation is key. HSU: Deepak Patel's hotel in Baltimore has a much shorter history, but he is also thinking about how to keep guests happy. He's leaning toward leasing a robot vacuum to allow housekeeping to focus on other things. And another technology has caught his eye - a kiosk that would sit just inside the entrance. DEEPAK PATEL: There's some person actually come to the screen as soon as you walk closer to the kiosk. HSU: A live person? DEEPAK PATEL: Live - I mean, on the screen, outsourced somewhere in some country. But they can collect the payment. They can check in the guest. They can even make a key. They can make a room change. HSU: It's not something he would have ever thought about when workers were plentiful. And even now. . . DEEPAK PATEL: We are not looking to replace a person 100%. HSU: Right. Yeah. DEEPAK PATEL: That's a - some filling of the gap at some time. HSU: Like now, when the phone is ringing and Patel is the only one here. Do you need to answer the - OK. DEEPAK PATEL: Yeah, I need to answer phone. I'm sorry. HSU: No problem. DEEPAK PATEL: I'll be right back. HSU: Before he got into the hotel business, Deepak Patel actually worked as a software engineer. Now he's thinking he ought to go back. A 9-to-5 job would bring peace of mind, he says, and allow him to take his family on a long-overdue vacation. DEEPAK PATEL: Good afternoon. This is Country Inn and Suites, Baltimore North.

Lina Khan is the chairperson of the FTC, the Federal Trade Commission. And since taking on that job, I think it's fair to say she's changed the way many people look at the department, with its aggressive approach towards what it sees as unfair methods of competition, things like huge companies buying out smaller competitors. And since it's been a big year for mergers and acquisitions, particularly in the tech department, we've called Lina Khan to hear more about her work in this area and her vision for the FTC going forward. Chair Lina Khan, welcome to the program. LINA KHAN: Great to be here. LIMBONG: All right, so I want to get to the news about Fortnite and Epic and all that. But first, for people who aren't familiar with the department, what does your job entail? KHAN: So the Federal Trade Commission's job is to stop unfair methods of competition and to stop unfair or deceptive practices in the marketplace. And what that means in general is we try to ensure that the economy is operating in a way that's fair and that consumers aren't getting harmed by illegal business practices. And so we do that through enforcing rules of fair competition, as well as strong consumer protections. LIMBONG: So before arriving at the FTC, you were widely regarded for your writings on antitrust law - right? - and your fresh perspectives on monopoly power in the digital age. Now that you've got some time on the inside - right? - like, has your perception of the FTC and, like, its work changed since your time at the helm? KHAN: One thing that's important to remember about the FTC is, you know, this is an agency that was created over a hundred years ago by Congress. It was created in 1914 against the backdrop of the robber barons and the industrial giants of that age. So you had the steel monopolies, monopolies in all sorts of sectors that had emerged that were, at that time, using their power in ways that Congress was very worried about. So this is an agency with an incredible history, an incredible legacy. I think, in a lot of ways, the agency's resources have not kept up. So basically, in 1980, there was a big gutting of our budget, and it really hasn't recovered since then. So we have around 1,100 people that are really charged with being on the front lines of some of the biggest challenges and problems that are facing Americans. And so we don't have the resources, oftentimes, to go fully toe-to-toe with some of the biggest companies in the economy who are extremely powerful, extremely wealthy. And so I would say it can be somewhat of a David-and-Goliath dynamic. We're a small, little agency that's really punching above our weight because Congress has given us such an important job. LIMBONG: All right, so let's talk about the video game industry for a second. You know, you saw one of the largest settlements in FTC history this week with Fortnite and Epic. It was 520 million for unwanted in-game purchases, as well as alleged violations of child privacy laws. I kind of want to focus on the child privacy issues because one of the main issues is children talking to adults - right? - causing all sorts of problems. But connecting through chat to other players has been, like, the bread and butter for so many online games, right? And I'm curious, what did Epic do with Fortnite that was particularly different or egregious, and what does it signal to other video game makers? KHAN: When companies are actively directing their products or services at children or if those services are being used by children and they know, there are a set of privacy laws and privacy rules on the books that companies have to abide by. This is under the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act. And so that lays out certain types of requirements relating to needing to get parental consent, needing to, by default, have certain provisions in place. And Epic just ignored those outright. There were all sorts of privacy protections that they flouted. One result of that was that they effectively were enabling real-time communications with strangers online. And so what we saw was that children were exposed to online bullying and blackmail and harassment, sometimes even sexual abuse, leading to significant trauma and even self-harm by kids and teens. So, you know, we took action against that this week, got a significant settlement and also have put in place important requirements that Epic must abide by to make sure that they're, by default, protecting children's privacy and the privacy of teens online. LIMBONG: In response, Epic put out a statement. It reads, quote, \"No developer creates a game with the intention of ending up here. The video game industry is a place of fast-moving innovation where players' expectations are high and new ideas are paramount. Statutes written decades ago don't specify how gaming ecosystems should operate. \" And I imagine you get this kind of pushback often - right? - from companies that want to innovate and merge with other companies for their bottom line. How do you respond to the argument that tech requires, like, innovation and acquisition to be dynamic and competitive? KHAN: The FTC is entirely pro-innovation, and a lot of our work is about ensuring that companies are able to compete in a fair way that is really what's promoting innovation in the first place. I think we've seen all sorts of instances in which monopolies, once they become incumbents, are not incentivized to innovate in the same way. And so really it's about keeping the market open to new entry, to startups, to entrepreneurs. That's so important for innovation. And forcing the antitrust laws is really critical to that. We also need to be very careful about, you know, what companies are describing as innovation. Sometimes it could be illegal practices, right? I mean, if you look back to the subprime mortgage crisis, when millions of Americans lost their homes, a lot of the financial tricks that the financial institutions had rolled out, what they were describing is innovation, right? So we need to be very careful and scrutinize what's really making sure that companies are innovating in legal ways through actually improving their business practices or actually providing Americans with products and services they want, rather than just refining their ways of deceiving people. LIMBONG: Right now, you're the bit of a lawsuit to stop Meta from acquiring the virtual reality company Within. Meta head Mark Zuckerberg just testified in court this week arguing his side. You know - and I know you can't talk specifics. So I think people are used to seeing the FTC step in when, like, mergers happen - like, big established industries - right? - like, communications and video games. Now, VR is a relatively new world. And so why did you feel the need for the FTC to step in here? KHAN: Yeah, can't talk about specifics about that lawsuit. I'll say, as a general matter, look, if you look back at history - right? - the moments when incumbent platforms feel most threatened is when there's new technology that could threaten to dislodge them. We saw this most recently when we saw the shift from desktop to mobile, where, for example, the Justice Department's lawsuit against Google notes that as the market was changing from desktop to mobile, Google felt threatened. And so it's those moments of technological transition when you see potentially new platforms emerging that offer both the most opportunity to inject real competition into the market with new upstarts, but also are most threatening to the incumbents. And that's where we, as enforcers, need to be most vigilant. LIMBONG: Yeah. All right, so for 2023, what do you predict? What are you girding for? What are you looking at? KHAN: So, look, we're going to continue building on all of this work. We are currently revising our merger guidelines. It sounds kind of technical, but it's basically the enforcement manual that lays out what mergers are illegal. We also recently clarified, as I mentioned, that we're going after unfair methods of competition. And so over the next year, you're going to see what that means in practice. One example that we've publicly shared is we're thinking about what we can do around non-compete clauses. So this is where companies require workers to sign away the right to leave for a better job, which can stifle not just a person's basic liberty and mobility, but also innovation and dynamism. And we've also started issuing strong consumer protection rules so that we can get money back to consumers who were illegally defrauded or deceived. Shockingly, sometimes, even when companies have defrauded consumers, the FTC doesn't have the authority to actually get those consumers the money that was stolen from them. And so we started all sorts of rulemakings to make sure we can finally do that. So if they've been deceived by, say, false earning claims that a company is making or fake reviews online, we want to make sure that Americans are being made whole. So that's a whole set of work that we have already underway that we're looking to continue building on and finalizing this next year. LIMBONG: Lina Khan is chair of the Federal Trade Commission. She's been in the role since June of last year. Before that, she was an associate professor of law at Columbia Law School. Chair Lina Khan, thank you so much for joining us.

Beyond the chaos at Twitter under Elon Musk, Facebook is trying to pivot to the metaverse and economic pressures are squeezing Silicon Valley. So let's talk about all this with NPR's Shannon Bond. Hi, Shannon. SHANNON BOND, BYLINE: Hi, Daniel. ESTRIN: Shannon, hit rewind for us. What were the big moments of this past year? BOND: Yeah, I think a lot of these big social networks started off the year, you know, attempting these kind of fresh starts. You know, Facebook spent very heavily betting on this immersive virtual metaverse that it's trying to create. At Twitter, there was already a new CEO in place even before Elon Musk made this surprise bid for the company. But, you know, almost right away, things got off track. There were ad revenue shortfalls across the sector. Facebook lost users for the first time. You know, companies were laying off thousands of workers, and many social media companies are feeling this pressure from TikTok, the very popular Chinese-owned short video app that's really redefining social media. Instead of connecting with friends, it's all about seeing the most engaging videos that anybody on the platform has posted. ESTRIN: So if TikTok is redefining social media, how are American social media companies responding? BOND: Well, platforms like Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, they are scrambling to copy some of these features on TikTok. You know, we're seeing more short videos in your feed. You might be seeing more videos recommended from people you don't know, you don't follow. And that's a big change. I spoke with Michael Sayman, who's an app developer who's worked at Facebook, Google and Twitter. MICHAEL SAYMAN: I think really, the moneymakers in social media and, really, the profit for these companies is not any more in the business of, like, friends sharing. BOND: He says these apps are becoming more like TV networks, right? There's a tiny fraction of creators who are making almost all the content. ESTRIN: Yeah, I have noticed this on my own Facebook and Instagram. You know, suddenly these videos pop up from people I do not follow. I guess at first, I was annoyed by it, and now I have to admit I find myself clicking on these mindlessly, and there they are. What do people feel about these changes? BOND: It's pushing a lot of users to look for alternative ways to, you know, keep up with those friends that they might not be seeing as many posts from, you know? So they're turning to messaging services like WhatsApp and Discord, apps like BeReal, where users post one unedited photo every day that can't be liked or shared. And we've also seen this disillusionment with legacy social sites has inspired this new crop of apps by and for conservatives, right? They feel their views are muzzled by Silicon Valley. And this year, we saw that partisan fracturing extend to Twitter, right? Elon Musk is courting right-wing users. He's alienating advertisers, employees and regulators. ESTRIN: Well, there has been a lot of focus in recent years on the harms of social media. So what's the effect of all these new changes in the social media landscape? BOND: Well, I think this fragmentation of the public conversation is making life more complicated - right? - both for threat actors who are trying to spread propaganda and amplify polarization across platforms and for people trying to investigate those threat actors, whether they're journalists or researchers or even the companies themselves. ESTRIN: So what are you looking for in the new year? BOND: Well, you know, I think there's going to be even more fragmentation. Twitter is in turmoil. People are looking for apps to replace it, and Elon Musk has said he'll step down as CEO, though we don't have any sense of the timing there. You know, TikTok is under national security scrutiny and facing bans from state and the federal government. But even more than that, I think there's this broader evolution in how people think about sharing. They're sort of turning to these more private places, and it suggests to me that the next era of social media will be defined not by one big mega-company where you're sharing to billions of people, but by making connections and sharing content scattered across many different apps.

Elon Musk spent $44 billion to take control of Twitter, only to see a number of advertisers and users flee. And across Silicon Valley, tens of thousands of workers have been laid off. NPR's Shannon Bond reports on the rocky year that was for social media companies. SHANNON BOND, BYLINE: At the beginning of the year, big social networks were trying fresh starts. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg had renamed his company Meta to signal a new direction. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MARK ZUCKERBERG: From now on, we're going to be Metaverse first, not Facebook first. BOND: Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey had handed the reins to a new CEO, Parag Agrawal. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PARAG AGRAWAL: Twitter serves a very important role in the world, and we've got responsibility to make it the best it can be very seriously. BOND: But within months, things changed dramatically. Amid global economic turmoil and Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the online advertising market cratered. Facebook announced its first-ever declines in users and sales. The company has lost about two-thirds of its market value this year. Elon Musk made a surprise bid for Twitter, spent months trying to get out of buying it and then unleashed chaos when he finally took over. Layoffs followed. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #1: Facebook parent Meta will begin laying off workers this morning. UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #2: The parent of Snapchat plans to lay off about 20% of its nearly 6,500 employees starting today. UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #3: Twitter is reportedly laying off about half of its 7,500 employees today. BOND: But it's not just economic and management upheaval that's shifting the foundation these companies have built their businesses on. Social media is entering a new era of fragmentation. Katie Harbath is a former public policy director at Facebook. KATIE HARBATH: Users are using them differently. Advertisers are using them differently. People are going to different places to get their entertainment, and advertisers are trying to figure out where those eyeballs are. BOND: That shift is epitomized by TikTok, the Chinese-owned short video app. Instead of connecting with friends, TikTok is all about seeing the most engaging videos from anyone anywhere. And that sent companies, including Facebook and Google, scrambling to copy TikTok's features. MICHAEL SAYMAN: There's a shinier object in the social media space, and it doesn't involve your friends and what your friends are up to. BOND: Michael Sayman is an app developer who's worked at Facebook, Google and Twitter. TikTok is facing bans by state governments and the federal government, but it's already changed the landscape. Sayman says the race to emulate TikTok is pushing the big social media apps to become more like TV networks, where a tiny fraction of users create almost all the content. SAYMAN: I think really the moneymakers in social media and really the profit for these companies is not anymore in the business of, like, friend sharing. BOND: That's left many people looking for alternative ways to keep up with friends through messaging services like WhatsApp, Signal and Discord and apps like BeReal, where users post one unedited photo a day that can't be liked or shared. Disillusionment with the legacy social sites has also inspired a new crop of apps by and for conservatives who feel their views are muzzled by Silicon Valley. Now, that partisan fracturing extends to Twitter, where Musk is courting right-wing users and alienating advertisers, employees and regulators. Harbath says it shows an evolution in how people think about what they share online. HARBATH: You know, the early days of social media, like particularly Facebook, thought that, like - that people have one identity and that they want to share parts of themselves with everybody that's in their lives. And it's actually turning out that that's not the case. BOND: Which suggests the next era of social media will be defined not by one mega company but by connections and content scattered across many apps. Shannon Bond, NPR News. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:   Over the last year, Facebook burned through billions of dollars trying to make the Metaverse happen. Elon Musk spent $44 billion to take control of Twitter, only to see a number of advertisers and users flee. And across Silicon Valley, tens of thousands of workers have been laid off. NPR's Shannon Bond reports on the rocky year that was for social media companies. SHANNON BOND, BYLINE: At the beginning of the year, big social networks were trying fresh starts. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg had renamed his company Meta to signal a new direction. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MARK ZUCKERBERG: From now on, we're going to be Metaverse first, not Facebook first. BOND: Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey had handed the reins to a new CEO, Parag Agrawal. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PARAG AGRAWAL: Twitter serves a very important role in the world, and we've got responsibility to make it the best it can be very seriously. BOND: But within months, things changed dramatically. Amid global economic turmoil and Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the online advertising market cratered. Facebook announced its first-ever declines in users and sales. The company has lost about two-thirds of its market value this year. Elon Musk made a surprise bid for Twitter, spent months trying to get out of buying it and then unleashed chaos when he finally took over. Layoffs followed. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE) UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #1: Facebook parent Meta will begin laying off workers this morning. UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #2: The parent of Snapchat plans to lay off about 20% of its nearly 6,500 employees starting today. UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #3: Twitter is reportedly laying off about half of its 7,500 employees today.

COMPUTER-GENERATED VOICE #2: (As Alexa) I added milk to your shopping list. SHAPIRO: You might even be listening to this podcast because AI software recommended it to you. Artificial intelligence is seeping more deeply into every corner of our existence. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: This piece of art right here, believe it or not, was created using AI or artificial intelligence, and it is stirring up a conversation of what is considered art. SHAPIRO: CONSIDER THIS - artificial intelligence is baked into our daily lives, but this recipe is still cooking. We'll look at the leaps in AI over the last year and what might be coming next. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)SHAPIRO: From NPR, I'm Ari Shapiro. It's Thursday, December 29. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)SHAPIRO: It's CONSIDER THIS FROM NPR. In the last year, something strange has happened. Friends have morphed into fairy princesses and astronauts. TV scripts, poetry and cover letters written by bots have sounded a whole lot like the creations of real humans. In short, 2022 has felt like a turning point for AI. NPR's Bobby Allyn reports on some new tools that showcase the power and the peril of this technology. BOBBY ALLYN, BYLINE: There are two crazes taking the internet by storm right now. The first is an image generator called Lensa. You upload a bunch of selfies to the app and it spits out a batch of hyperrealistic avatars - you in space, you as an anime character. All of them have one thing in common - as one person put it on Twitter, you, but 20% hotter. Oren Etzioni runs the Seattle-based Allen Institute for AI. OREN ETZIONI: They've really taken this technology and they tied it with people's ego and their vanity. And that combination has proven to be almost irresistible. ALLYN: The second tool causing lots of buzz is called ChatGPT. It's a bot that can hold a conversation or answer questions a lot like a human. You ask it something, and it starts responding in a way that can freak you out pretty fast. I asked it to place a Chipotle order in the speaking style of Donald Trump, and it said, quote, \"all right, folks, let me tell you - this Chipotle order is going to be huge - the best Chipotle order you've ever seen, believe me. We're talking about a big, beautiful burrito bowl. \" It went on from there. With such a gift for language, it did make me wonder, will ChatGPT one day replace me? ETZIONI: It's pretty funny, right? Are you going to be out of a job? Of course, I'm probably going to be out of a job because you don't really need me. You could just take those questions, feed them into the ChatGPT, and it'll give you pretty plausible answers. ALLYN: It may seem like AI has all of a sudden gotten really, really good, but Etzioni likes to say AI's overnight success has been 50 years in the making. Some of the most advanced AI tools are being developed secretly by tech giants like Google and Facebook. The companies aren't ready to publicly release them, in part because the ways they can be abused is still being studied. But startups, like the companies behind Lensa and ChatGPT, have another approach. Release the tools publicly, see how they're used, then try to put up guardrails to prevent abuse. Obviously, sending tools this powerful into the wild will produce all sorts of results. Jen King studies privacy and AI at Stanford. She's noticed one thing ChatGPT does that's concerning. JEN KING: You can give it a prompt to explain something in terms that make it sound extremely legitimate, but the underlying facts are actually incorrect. ALLYN: For instance, I asked ChatGPT to generate a job cover letter for me, and it made a passable one. But it also said I worked for a newspaper in a city I used to live in but never actually worked for. Some AI researchers have a name for this - hallucinating. AI researcher Etzioni says, though ChatGPT can answer questions in a way that seems persuasive, nothing it says should be taken as fact. ETZIONI: A colleague of mine referred to ChatGPT as a mouth without a brain. ALLYN: With Lensa, one problem many users are reporting is that the avatars produced tend to overly sexualize women. Sometimes, the app will even create a completely naked cartoon version of you, even if all you gave the app were photos of your face. King with Stanford says this is because Lensa, like most AI tools, is trained using vast amounts of data from the internet. And it's the internet, so there's lots of pornography. KING: Some of these companies are really training their models on what I would call the internet's toxic waste. And so to me, it's no surprise that we see these effects. ALLYN: The company behind Lensa has responded to people who have complained about their avatars being sexualized. It says it has tweaked its AI algorithm so that nudity is avoided. And if your avatar does have nudity, the company says it should now be blurred. Not everyone is upset with their Lensa avatars. There already are reports of people bringing their Lensa portraits to plastic surgeons for inspiration. Bobby Allyn, NPR News. SHAPIRO: So was 2022 the year that advancements in artificial intelligence made the world a much scarier place? Or does it just feel that way? Put another way, did I write this introduction, or did a chat bot? Brian Christian is author of the bestselling book \"The Alignment Problem,\" and he's here to help us look back and forward at the impact AI is having on our lives. Good to have you here. BRIAN CHRISTIAN: Thank you. It's a pleasure. SHAPIRO: Well, in addition to everything we just heard about, this was also the year that a piece of art generated by AI won a prize at the Colorado State Fair. This was the year a Google engineer claimed that an AI chat bot was sentient, even though many experts later downplayed his claim. Put all this together and, like, what kind of a headline would you write about AI in 2022? CHRISTIAN: I think this is really the year that AI research went mainstream. A lot of these systems have been kind of brewing within research labs for the last several years, but this is really, I would say, the grand debut in terms of actually having real-world impact and being the kind of thing that now millions of people are actively using every day. SHAPIRO: So if this isn't necessarily new technology, but newly public technology, what does that mean? Like, what does it mean that all of this is now publicly recognizably in our faces? CHRISTIAN: I think a lot of the concerns that people had about this technology that existed in the academic literature as hypothetical problems have now become real problems that we need to figure out and muddle through in real time. Whether that's the sort of concerns of plagiarism or using intellectual property, whether that is, you know, the ability to create misinformation and toxic speech - all of these things that people had been worrying about as possible downstream consequences of this technology, well, now, you know, the rubber has hit the road, and we actually have to deal with it. SHAPIRO: The abstract suddenly became real. CHRISTIAN: Very much. SHAPIRO: So when you hear about these kinds of new advances, where do you emotionally land on the spectrum between excited and terrified? CHRISTIAN: I wouldn't say that I'm on the spectrum between excited and terrified. I would say I feel very excited and very terrified. SHAPIRO: (Laughter) Both can coexist at the same time. CHRISTIAN: Indeed. SHAPIRO: What's the thing that most excites you about it? And then I'll ask you the thing that most terrifies you about it. CHRISTIAN: The thing that most excites me is that it feels to me - and, you know, not everyone is going to agree with this - but it feels to me that the field of AI is finally delivering on the sort of philosophical promise that the field has had going back to the 1940s and '50s of trying to unlock, if you will, the secrets of intelligence - trying to rediscover some of the principles that evolution itself has found for how thinking works. And so for me, it feels like, after, you know, 70 years of trying various things, we have hit, if you will, the philosophical paydirt. And so that's what's really kind of riveting for me - is what this ends up teaching us about ourselves - about the nature of cognition itself. SHAPIRO: And what keeps you up at night? CHRISTIAN: What keeps me up at night is, I would say, this concept that in the field is called the alignment problem, which is that. . . SHAPIRO: Conveniently, the title of your book. CHRISTIAN: Yes. Yes. I've spent many years sleepless about this. And the alignment problem is the idea that we build these systems to do some particular mathematical task that we can define really easily in the code, but that's not often what we actually want the system to do. So for example, these language models are trained to be essentially autocomplete on steroids. They're really good at predicting the next word that you're going to type or a missing word in a document. But when we use them, we expect something else, which is we expect them to use language in a way that's helpful and honest and polite and free of bias and truthful. But that's not actually the incentive structure that we gave them. We just told them to make good predictions. SHAPIRO: What's the one big AI innovation that you are holding your breath to see - whether in a positive or negative way? CHRISTIAN: I think that we currently have systems that can do amazing things with language. We have systems that can do amazing things with visual imagery. There are a lot of exciting advances in robotics, and I think there is a sense of collective holding of breath to see what happens when we can actually integrate these things together. What does it mean to have a system that can both use language in this seemingly human-level fluency, but also move around the world physically and understand what it's looking at? I think that's the road that we're on at the moment. SHAPIRO: What - is that, like, a robot that moves through the world? Is that a virtual-reality, immersive ecosystem? Like, what is that? CHRISTIAN: I think we're probably going to see a little bit of all of the above. So that might be domestic robots that, you know, help fold your laundry or something like that. I think it's, in the shorter term, more likely to be assistants that help you on your computer, but they can actually see what's on your screen. So they could navigate a website for you and purchase your airline tickets or do a bunch of, you know, scholarship research for you on the internet - that sort of thing. I think those systems are going to be more and more a part of just how we navigate the world digitally and then in the longer run physically, too. SHAPIRO: Something to look forward to in 2023. That is Brian Christian. He writes about the human implications of computer science, and he's author of the book, \"The Alignment Problem: Machine Learning And Human Values. \"Oh, by the way, I did write that introduction. Brian Christian, thanks a lot. CHRISTIAN: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)SHAPIRO: It's CONSIDER THIS FROM NPR. I'm Ari Shapiro.

Or maybe you clipped coupons and recipes. Well, in three of Alabama's largest cities, the printing presses will stop rolling early next year. That'll spell the end of the Birmingham News, The Huntsville Times and Mobile's Press-Register as they go all digital. It's part of a national trend in local journalism, one that has some Birmingham subscribers worried that they'll be left behind. NPR's Debbie Elliott reports. DEBBIE ELLIOTT, BYLINE: It's gotten harder to buy a copy of the Birmingham News, but you can find the latest edition hanging from a spindle at the public library downtown. SHERREL WHEELER STEWART: And a lot of people have read it. Look at this - spaghetti sauce on the side over there. ELLIOTT: Sherrel Wheeler Stewart points out food stains splattered on the front page. She's a former editor and reporter who spent nearly two decades working for the Birmingham News. WHEELER STEWART: Front page used to be that place that was, I guess you could say, sacred. To pick up a Sunday paper, open it up and see your name at the top - you know, that's - that was - I mean, it was just special, you know? ELLIOTT: Stewart says the move to digital only is a loss for the community. WHEELER STEWART: It's just not a good thing. I think a metropolitan city - Birmingham is on the move. I think a city like Birmingham needs a printed newspaper. ELLIOTT: Ten years ago, the Birmingham News and sister papers in Huntsville and Mobile went from publishing daily down to three times a week. Even that will end after February 26, after parent company Alabama Media Group announced it will permanently stop the presses. While Stewart is sad to see the end of the print era, she acknowledges that even she now mostly gets her news from the paper's digital site, al. com. Alabama Media Group president Tom Bates says that's where the audience is. TOM BATES: The growth on the digital side for us has been extraordinary. And so if our job is to get out important stories, we need to get them out the way that people want to receive them. ELLIOTT: Bates says a decade ago, the combined daily circulation for the Birmingham News, The Huntsville Times and The Mobile Press-Register was about 260,000. Now it's down to roughly 30,000, he says, compared to al. com's daily reach of about a million people a day. Longtime journalists in the newsroom saw this day coming. JOHN ARCHIBALD: You know, I've warned the newspaper a dozen years ago, frankly. ELLIOTT: John Archibald is a Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist for al. com and has been with The Birmingham News since 1986. Sitting outside a local coffee shop, Archibald says he hardly ever sees the print edition anymore. It might sound like heresy for an old newspaper man, but he says that's the future of journalism. ARCHIBALD: Well, you know, I have nostalgia for print. And I love the newspaper. It's not the paper that I love. It's the notion of going out and covering news that people need to know. ELLIOTT: What's happening in Alabama is where local papers have been headed for a while, says Penny Muse Abernathy with the local news initiative at Northwestern University's Medill School of Journalism. PENNY MUSE ABERNATHY: It is part of a whole progression as we've seen the diminishment of daily newspapers over the past two decades. ELLIOTT: Abernathy is the author of annual reports on the state of local news around the nation. The 2022 report found that at least 1 in 5 of the 100 largest newspapers in the country is now publishing two or fewer times a week in a print edition. As papers disappear, Abernathy says the question is whether digital publications can play the same role in civic life that newspapers traditionally have. ABERNATHY: And I think that's really what you're dealing with - is what is the relevance of these papers in a digital age? ELLIOTT: People have been reading The Birmingham News since the late 1800s. Mayor Randall Woodfin says it will be an adjustment no longer having it. RANDALL WOODFIN: It'll be a shock to the system. ELLIOTT: At age 41, Woodfin is a digital-first news consumer. But he knows not everyone is wired that way. WOODFIN: We embrace the innovation. I would just hope we still found a way to communicate with every generation. I think over this last decade, I've received my news more digitally anyway, so I was able to brace. I would be - for those who haven't braced and still depend on those three days, I'm concerned. I should call my stepmom right here in front of you to see what she says. Let's do it. (SOUNDBITE OF DIAL TONE RINGING)ELLIOTT: He dials up Yvonne Fluker Woodfin, who steadfastly clips and collects newspaper articles about her stepson. YVONNE FLUKER WOODFIN: Hello. WOODFIN: Hello, young lady. FLUKER WOODFIN: Hey, darling. How are you? WOODFIN: Things are good. What about yourself? FLUKER WOODFIN: Oh, doing pretty good. Thank you. WOODFIN: I wanted to talk to you about the newspaper. Are you aware that they're going away from all print? How do you feel about that? FLUKER WOODFIN: Well, I think it will make a lot of people not be aware of what's going on. ELLIOTT: Access is a concern. In the pandemic, public schools here found that about 1 in 5 families had limited or no internet access. Still, you don't see newspapers like you used to - scattered around tables at the coffee shop or local lunch counter. (SOUNDBITE OF SILVERWARE CLATTERING)ELLIOTT: To hear how longtime Birmingham News subscribers are reacting, I stopped by the lunch buffet at the American Legion in Homewood, a close-in suburb. AL LAPIERRE: We call this our government in exile table back here. ELLIOTT: Al LaPierre is a former head of the Alabama Democratic Party. He's sitting at a long table of politicos who get together every Wednesday. LaPierre says he's really not surprised that the newspaper's days are numbered. LAPIERRE: But I noticed a few years ago even - you bought the Birmingham News on a Saturday or a Sunday. Everything you saw on their media site the next - the day before was there. So why get it? ELLIOTT: But across the table, retired political scientist Natalie Davis defends the paper. She still subscribes and worries about what will be lost when it's gone. NATALIE DAVIS: The newspaper was probably the only thing left where - if everybody reads the story in the same way and gets the same facts, then you have a baseline. And that will go away. And it's gone. It's gone probably now. But, I mean, that's what newspapers do. ELLIOTT: Retired veterinarian Chandler McGee stops by the table. He's 84 and says the Birmingham News has been a lifeline. CHANDLER MCGEE: One of the joys of my life is reading the newspaper. ELLIOTT: He lives in a retirement community where he says few residents get news online. MCGEE: I think, I mean, especially for senior citizens, that we're going to be cut off from what's happening in our city and our state. ELLIOTT: Alabama Media Group executives say that's not their intent and believe everyone in the three metro areas they serve should have a way to access their free content online, whether on a computer or smartphone. Al. com columnist Roy Johnson came to Birmingham in 2015. He'd been a long-time sportswriter at Sports Illustrated and The New York Times and various national magazines, some of which are no longer in publication. ROY JOHNSON: I really have lived a life that represents the evolution of the media industry. ELLIOTT: He says the distribution method might have changed, but the mission remains. JOHNSON: You know, one of these days, we're going to have to explain to our grandkids why we put words on a piece of paper, balled it up, rolled it up, put it in a car truck, drove it around and threw it on people's driveway. That's how they got their news. I said for them, it'll be like the Pony Express to us. ELLIOTT: Johnson's advice to longtime print readers - this is the digital age, so come along. Debbie Elliott, NPR News, Birmingham. (SOUNDBITE OF MNELIA SONG, \"CLOSURE\") ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:   Have you ever saved the front page of the newspaper as a memento of an important moment? Or maybe you clipped coupons and recipes. Well, in three of Alabama's largest cities, the printing presses will stop rolling early next year. That'll spell the end of the Birmingham News, The Huntsville Times and Mobile's Press-Register as they go all digital. It's part of a national trend in local journalism, one that has some Birmingham subscribers worried that they'll be left behind. NPR's Debbie Elliott reports. DEBBIE ELLIOTT, BYLINE: It's gotten harder to buy a copy of the Birmingham News, but you can find the latest edition hanging from a spindle at the public library downtown. SHERREL WHEELER STEWART: And a lot of people have read it. Look at this - spaghetti sauce on the side over there. ELLIOTT: Sherrel Wheeler Stewart points out food stains splattered on the front page. She's a former editor and reporter who spent nearly two decades working for the Birmingham News. WHEELER STEWART: Front page used to be that place that was, I guess you could say, sacred. To pick up a Sunday paper, open it up and see your name at the top - you know, that's - that was - I mean, it was just special, you know? ELLIOTT: Stewart says the move to digital only is a loss for the community. WHEELER STEWART: It's just not a good thing. I think a metropolitan city - Birmingham is on the move. I think a city like Birmingham needs a printed newspaper. ELLIOTT: Ten years ago, the Birmingham News and sister papers in Huntsville and Mobile went from publishing daily down to three times a week. Even that will end after February 26, after parent company Alabama Media Group announced it will permanently stop the presses. While Stewart is sad to see the end of the print era, she acknowledges that even she now mostly gets her news from the paper's digital site, al. com.

TV scripts, poetry and cover letters are being written by a bot that sounds a whole lot like a real human. Artificial intelligence is having a moment, with people using new tools to show off just how advanced AI has gotten. As NPR's Bobby Allyn reports, these tools are showcasing the power and the peril of the current state of AI. BOBBY ALLYN, BYLINE: There are two crazes taking the internet by storm right now. The first is an image generator called Lensa. You upload a bunch of selfies to the app, and it spits out a batch of hyper-realistic avatars - you in space, you as an anime character. All of them have one thing in common - as one person put it on Twitter - you, but 20% hotter. Oren Etzioni runs the Seattle-based Allen Institute for AI. OREN ETZIONI: They've really taken this technology, and they tied it with people's ego and their vanity. And that combination has proven to be almost irresistible. ALLYN: The second tool causing lots of buzz is called ChatGPT. It's a bot that can hold a conversation or answer questions a lot like a human. You ask it something, and it starts responding in a way that can freak you out pretty fast. I asked it to place a Chipotle order in the speaking style of Donald Trump, and it said, quote, \"all right, folks, let me tell you. This Chipotle order is going to be huge, the best Chipotle order you've ever seen, believe me. We're talking about a big, beautiful burrito bowl. \" It went on from there. With such a gift for language, it did make me wonder, will ChatGPT one day replace me? ETZIONI: It's pretty funny, right? Are you going to be out of a job? Of course, I'm probably going to be out of a job because you don't really need me. You could just take those questions, feed them into ChatGPT, and it'll give you pretty plausible answers. ALLYN: It may seem like AI has all of a sudden gotten really, really good. But Etzioni likes to say AI's overnight success has been 50 years in the making. Some of the most advanced AI tools are being developed secretly by tech giants like Google and Facebook. The companies aren't ready to publicly release them, in part because the ways they can be abused is still being studied. But startups like the companies behind Lensa and ChatGPT have another approach - release the tools publicly, see how they're used, then try to put up guardrails to prevent abuse. Obviously, sending tools this powerful into the wild will produce all sorts of results. Jen King studies privacy and AI at Stanford. She's noticed one thing ChatGPT does that's concerning. JEN KING: You can give it a prompt to explain something in terms that make it sound extremely legitimate, but the underlying facts are actually incorrect. ALLYN: For instance, I asked ChatGPT to generate a job cover letter for me, and it made a passable one. But it also said I worked for a newspaper in a city I used to live in but never actually worked for. Some AI researchers have a name for this - hallucinating. AI researcher Etzioni says though ChatGPT can answer questions in a way that seems persuasive, nothing it says should be taken as fact. ETZIONI: A colleague of mine referred to ChatGPT as a mouth without a brain. ALLYN: With Lensa, one problem many users are reporting is that the avatars produced tend to overly sexualize women. Sometimes the app will even create a completely naked cartoon version of you, even if all you gave the app were photos of your face. King with Stanford says this is because Lensa, like most AI tools, is trained using vast amounts of data from the internet. And it's the internet, so there's lots of pornography. KING: Some of these companies are really training their models on what I would call the internet's toxic waste. And so to me, it's no surprise that we see these effects. ALLYN: The company behind Lensa has responded to people who have complained about their avatars being sexualized. It says it has tweaked its AI algorithm so that nudity is avoided. And if your avatar does have nudity, the company says it should now be blurred. Not everyone is upset with their Lensa avatars. There already are reports of people bringing their Lensa portraits to plastic surgeons for inspiration. Bobby Allyn, NPR News.

Put another way, did I write this introduction, or did a chat bot? Brian Christian is author of the bestselling book \"The Alignment Problem,\" and he's here to help us look back and forward at the impact AI is having on our lives. Good to have you here. BRIAN CHRISTIAN: Thank you. It's a pleasure. SHAPIRO: Well, in addition to everything we just heard about, this was also the year that a piece of art generated by AI won a prize at the Colorado State Fair. This was the year a Google engineer claimed that an AI chat bot was sentient, even though many experts later downplayed his claim. Put all this together and, like, what kind of a headline would you write about AI in 2022? CHRISTIAN: I think this is really the year that AI research went mainstream. A lot of these systems have been kind of brewing within research labs for the last several years, but this is really, I would say, the grand debut in terms of actually having real-world impact and being the kind of thing that now millions of people are actively using every day. SHAPIRO: So if this isn't necessarily new technology but newly public technology, what does that mean? Like, what does it mean that all of this is now publicly, recognizably in our faces? CHRISTIAN: I think a lot of the concerns that people had about this technology that existed in the academic literature as hypothetical problems have now become real problems that we need to figure out and muddle through in real time. Whether that's the sort of concerns of plagiarism or using intellectual property, whether that is, you know, the ability to create misinformation and toxic speech, all of these things that people had been worrying about as possible downstream consequences of this technology - well, now, you know, the rubber has hit the road. And we actually have to deal with it. SHAPIRO: The abstract suddenly became real. CHRISTIAN: Very much. SHAPIRO: So when you hear about these kinds of new advances, where do you emotionally land on the spectrum between excited and terrified? CHRISTIAN: I wouldn't say that I'm on the spectrum between excited and terrified. I would say I feel very excited and very terrified. SHAPIRO: (Laughter) Both can coexist at the same time. CHRISTIAN: Indeed. SHAPIRO: What's the one big AI innovation that you are holding your breath to see, whether in a positive or negative way? CHRISTIAN: I think that we currently have systems that can do amazing things with language. We have systems that can do amazing things with visual imagery. There are a lot of exciting advances in robotics, and I think there is a sense of collective holding of breath to see what happens when we can actually integrate these things together. What does it mean to have a system that can both use language in this seemingly human-level fluency but also move around the world physically and understand what it's looking at? I think that's the road that we're on at the moment. SHAPIRO: What - is that, like, a robot that moves through the world? Is that a virtual reality, immersive ecosystem? What is that? CHRISTIAN: I think we're probably going to see a little bit of all of the above. So that might be domestic robots that, you know, help fold your laundry or something like that. I think it's, in the shorter term, more likely to be assistants that help you on your computer, but they can actually see what's on your screen, so they could navigate a website for you and purchase your airline tickets or do a bunch of, you know, scholarship research for you on the internet - that sort of thing. I think those systems are going to be more and more a part of just how we navigate the world digitally and then, in the longer run, physically, too. SHAPIRO: Something to look forward to in 2023. That is Brian Christian. He writes about the human implications of computer science, and he's author of the book \"The Alignment Problem: Machine Learning And Human Values. \" Oh, by the way, I did write that introduction.

NPR's David Gura reports. DAVID GURA, BYLINE: Remember all the commercials and the celebrity endorsements? There was Tom Brady, pushing crypto on a buddy who's a bartender in Boston, still upset Brady left the Patriots. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As character) What's up? TOM BRADY: I'm getting into crypto with FTX. You in? UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As character) I believe I'm in but still hate you. BRADY: Understood. GURA: In the early days of 2022, crypto ads were everywhere - on TV, but also on bus stops and in fortune cookies. Crypto companies spent tens of millions of dollars on marketing. January and February may have been peak hype for the crypto industry, according to Molly White. She's a crypto skeptic and a fellow at Harvard who runs the site Web3 Is Going Just Great. MOLLY WHITE: Prices had hit all-time highs. People were making irrational amounts of money. GURA: The value of bitcoin was almost four times what it is now, close to its all-time high. And the crypto industry was trying to grow its customer base to mainstream itself, as White puts it. On \"The Tonight Show,\" Paris Hilton talked to Jimmy Fallon about her wedding, about a trip she took to Burning Man and then about how she's hawking NFTs, another kind of digital asset - basically kind of cartoony crypto art. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"THE TONIGHT SHOW STARRING JIMMY FALLON\")PARIS HILTON: And I want to give one to everyone in the audience. (APPLAUSE)JIMMY FALLON: Everyone gets an NFT. HILTON: Yes, everyone. FALLON: Everyone gets an NFT tonight. GURA: Well, peak hype, as Molly White put it, didn't last long. Financial regulators started to crack down on crypto more than they had. And as the Federal Reserve started raising interest rates to fight high inflation, crypto prices tanked with stocks and other assets. And we saw the start of what's been called a crypto winter - a downturn that's gone on and on. LEE REINERS: You know, we've been living in the crypto winter for the better part of a year. GURA: Lee Reiners teaches cryptocurrency law at Duke University. And while the crypto crash hurt investors, especially people who bought in near the highs, it also revealed bigger systemic problems in the crypto industry. REINERS: It really exposed a number of crypto firms who were, you know, overextended, had poor risk management, you know, or otherwise just engaging in fraudulent activity. GURA: Now, we'll get to FTX in a minute. But before that collapse, there was a string of failures - a pair of cryptocurrencies called Terra and Luna, the trading platform Voyager, a crypto hedge fund, BlockFi, Celsius. The list goes on and on. And according to Reiners, it highlights something troublesome about crypto. REINERS: These firms are deeply interconnected. And so the moment you kind of have one problem somewhere in the crypto sector, it spreads very, very quickly. GURA: Which brings us to FTX. I promised we'd get to it. FTX was one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world. And at the start of 2022, it was valued at $32 billion. Now, it's bankrupt. More than a million people are worried the money they put into it has disappeared, and the company's founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, has been charged with criminal fraud. Reiners says FTX's collapse was the biggest event in crypto's history - a history, he adds, that's, quote, \"replete with a lot of failures and scams and frauds and hacks. \" And now, people are wondering what could be the next domino to fall. Binance is the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange. And after a recent series of panic-driven withdrawals, there's worry about its viability. Binance is pushing back against those fears and against crypto skepticism, and Molly White says the company has to. WHITE: If people start to question the industry as a whole or crypto as an asset class, that is devastating for Binance. And so they are doing anything that they can to prevent that from happening. GURA: It's disorienting to look around the world of crypto today to see how much has changed. WHITE: I think crypto would be lucky if all they were was set back by a couple of years. GURA: True believers expect bitcoin will bounce back and this crypto winter will thaw eventually. But White says, for people who were never crypto enthusiasts, who maybe saw an ad or felt this fear of missing out, it's a different story, especially after the collapse of FTX - after so much money just vanished. WHITE: I think people are starting to think of crypto as, you know, this big scam that they would not want anything to do with. GURA: And that poses an existential problem for crypto, White says. Because for crypto to work, it requires an ever-larger stream of people to keep buying it. David Gura, NPR News, New York.
