I'm Scott Simon. The war in Afghanistan intensified in 2015, even as the conflict in Syria and battles in Iraq got more attention. The Taliban has resurfaced in Afghanistan and now controls a fifth of the country. Islamic State offshoots have emerged in Afghanistan and al-Qaida training camps have been established in several parts of the country. Afghan forces have suffered heavy casualties and President Obama has halted the withdrawal of U. S. military forces, prolonging the American role in a war that has gone on for 14 years. Andrew Wilder is the vice president of Asia programs at the United States Institute of Peace and he joins us now. Thanks so much for being with us. ANDREW WILDER: Thank you. SIMON: Why do you think the Taliban's gained so much ground this year? WILDER: Well, I think the most obvious reason is that, you know, two years ago we had 140,000 U. S. -NATO forces in Afghanistan, and today we have about 13,000, of which about just under 10,000 are U. S. forces. And so when you withdraw very well-trained and equipped troops from Afghanistan, there's going to be a consequence. SIMON: You paint it as a failure of U. S. policy. WILDER: In part. I think there's many contributing factors. I was actually not necessarily a fan of the surge of going up to 100,000 in the first place, but I would have cautioned against drawing down from that level down to under 10,000 in a very short period of time. SIMON: I haven't been there since 2002, but I remember Afghans speaking very movingly about their contempt for the Taliban and remembering public beheadings and executions and the way they were forced to live as prisoners in their own homes. WILDER: Yeah, and I think largely there's still not a large popular support for the Taliban coming back to power. But I think where there's been a failure is on the Afghan government side, a failure of leadership, you know, both under President Karzai where he adopted a leadership style of backing sort of corrupt and predatory local leaders and many Afghans at the local level are sort of caught between, you know, corrupt and predatory local government officials and the Taliban, neither of whom which they like. SIMON: Mr. Wilder, when you talk about that it might've been unwise for so many U. S. troops to leave and how there has to be a continuation of U. S. military presence in Afghanistan, I can imagine a lot of Americans hearing that at home and saying wait a minute. We've been there 14 years. Why? WILDER: Well, I think it's important to go back to the reason why we went to Afghanistan. We went there because of 9/11 and, you know, transnational terrorist groups, namely al-Qaida, at that time were based in Afghanistan from which they planned and launched some of the attacks on the U. S. homeland. I think if we pull out of Afghanistan too quickly and see the collapse of the state again and a return back to the anarchic situation which we had in the 1990s, you will see Afghanistan become a safe haven for transnational terrorist groups again. SIMON: And what about those Americans who say when does the country stand on its own? WILDER: That's one of the areas where I think, you know, political leadership needs to be honest with the American public that there isn't a quick fix solution to these situations. But there's a devastatingly high cost if you pull out prematurely and allow states to collapse, which we kind of saw in Iraq or in Syria or in Libya. And Afghanistan is not at that stage. We have a government in Afghanistan now that is very pro-Western, reform-oriented, unfortunately very weak. And we also have Afghan National Security Forces that are fighting very hard. I mean, we've had over 7,000 killed fighting the Taliban in Afghanistan. So it's not just the U. S. that is fighting there. SIMON: In November, we saw Afghans in the street who protested the beheadings by ISIS of ethnic Hazara. Does this signal a new political engagement by a lot of Afghans? WILDER: I think there is growing unhappiness, you know, about the deteriorating security situation and as well as the sharp deterioration in the economy. And I think that those demonstrations were a manifestation of that. I think it's probably too early to conclude that it's part of a broader pattern because Afghans fear instability more than anything else. The most notable thing about that demonstration is it remained largely peaceful. SIMON: Andrew Wilder, vice president of Asia programs at the U. S. Institute of Peace, thanks so much for being with us. WILDER: Thank you. SCOTT SIMON, HOST:  This is WEEKEND EDITION from NPR News. I'm Scott Simon.

I'm Terry Gross. Just as there seemed to be some diplomatic progress in the Middle East, with the deal over Iran's nuclear program about to be implemented and talks for a political resolution to the civil war in Syria planned to start this month, those efforts are being jeopardized by a new conflict. That conflict has erupted between two rival nations in the region - Iran and Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia executed a Shiite cleric on January 2. In response, an Iranian mob attacked the Saudi Embassy in Tehran. Then the Saudis severed diplomatic ties with Iran. My guest is journalist Robin Wright, who has been covering the region since 1973 and has reported on every war in the region since then. She's now a contributing writer for The New Yorker and is a joint fellow at the U. S. Institute of Peace and the Woodrow Wilson International Center. Her books include \"Rock The Casbah: Rage And Rebellion Across The Islamic World\" and \"Dreams And Shadows: The Future Of The Middle East. \" Robin Wright, welcome to FRESH AIR. Before we talk about the repercussions of this new rift between Iran and Saudi Arabia, let's talk about what caused it. The Saudis beheaded a Shiite cleric named Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr. Who was he and why did the Saudis say they beheaded him? ROBIN WRIGHT: Sheikh Nimr was a prominent critic of the monarchy. He was a leading cleric of the Shiite sect inside Saudi Arabia. The Shiites make between 10 and 15 percent of Saudi Arabia's population, but they also live in the most important part of Saudi Arabia, which are the eastern oil fields. They live and work in the Eastern Provinces and have long felt that they don't reap the benefits or rewards of the resources on their own territory, whether it's the financial benefits, the social infrastructure, you know, health benefits, or whether it's a role in the political structure. And so for more than three decades, there have been bubbling movements that have risen and fallen over time to try to challenge the government over Shiite rights. The Saudi monarchy is Sunni. Saudi Arabia is the guardian of Islam's holy places. There is a long-standing tension between Sunni and Shiites over the interpretation of Islam - who should be the leaders, what is the proper doctrine, the proper interpretation of Islam. So the friction inside the kingdom comes in context of this long-standing division. Sheikh Nimr was a critic, but he had not been involved physically in violence. He had sympathized with the people, he had been - used pretty tough language when it came to criticizing the monarchy. He called it authoritarian and reactionary and said that - told American diplomats who interviewed him in 2008 that he would always side with the people against the government if it ever came to some kind of confrontation. He became controversial in 2012, in the aftermath of a new round of protests in the kingdom that were spawned in large part by the Arab Spring, as the protests began to spread across the entire Arab world. And he was arrested at that time. He was charged with a number of offenses, including the absence of loyalty to the ruler, fomenting dissent and inciting public violence. So this is - that's the core of the offenses that led to his execution on January 2. GROSS: So he was beheaded. Is beheading a typical punishment in Saudi Arabia? Is that their form of capital punishment? WRIGHT: The 47 men who were executed on January 2 were all either beheaded or put in front of firing squads. Beheading is a common practice in the kingdom. And, in fact, some of the various punishments - whether it's beheading or chopping off an arm or a leg for various other crimes, including robbery - are often done in public squares in the kingdom to drive home the point that these are costly offenses. GROSS: So in response to the beheading of the sheikh, an Iranian mob burned down the Saudi Embassy in Iran. And again, the sheikh was Shiite; Iran is a Shiite country. The sheikh had studied in Iran. So after the Iranian mob burned down the Saudi Embassy in Iran, the Saudis broke off diplomatic relations with Iran. So what events - like, what ongoing diplomatic events and talks does this falling-out between Iran and Saudi Arabia - not that their relationship was good before this, but it's worse now - so what does this put in jeopardy in the region? WRIGHT: Well, the timing of this confrontation is really dangerous because January was to be the month of developments, important developments, on four different peace initiatives that were really part of the international effort to prevent the Middle East from disintegrating completely. The first is the anticipated peace talks between the Syrian government and the Syrian opposition on January 25. This is the political complement to the military campaign against the Islamic State. This is the package of initiatives designed to hold Syria together to end what is the greatest humanitarian crisis and the bloodiest conflict in the world right now. The second one is the peace talks on the Yemen. Again, an enormous humanitarian crisis - 80 percent of the people in Yemen no longer have access to fresh water and are dependent on humanitarian aid to eat. And so the peace talks - a second round of peace talks - were supposed to happen this month. A cease-fire went into place last month. But on the same day that the Shiite cleric was executed, the Saudi-led coalition announced it was no longer going to comply with the cease-fire. And that, of course, jeopardizes the peace effort and any attempt to engage in another cease-fire. The third is the very important progress made last month by the Iraqi government in pushing back ISIS from the strategic town of Ramadi, and making some political gains as well. And this is a moment where the entire region, and particularly Saudi Arabia and Iran, have interest - and in some cases, rival interests. And the fourth very important - especially for the United States - is the Iran nuclear deal, which was expected to be formally implemented this month, which means Iran will have complied with dismantling some of its program, shipping out its low-enriched uranium, limiting the number of centrifuges used to enrich uranium, and then the lifting of sanctions. This was a moment that Iran was going to kind of begin to end its pariah status. And all these things suddenly are on the table because of the deepening rift between the two Islamic powers in the Middle East. GROSS: Well, why does that rift jeopardize, for instance, the Iranian nuclear deal? WRIGHT: Well, the Saudis have long been opposed to a nuclear deal with Iran, not just because of the nuclear deal or the terms of the deal. This - all this goes back to the long-standing rivalry between these two Gulf powers. And on a lot of different levels they are - it's the Shiite-Sunni rift that dates back 14 centuries but has taken on a kind of new face over the last few decades but particularly in the last couple of years. It's the long-standing rivalry between Persians in Iran and Arabs in Gulf countries. It plays out, you know, in terms of their relationship with the outside world. Remember, Iran was one of the two pillars of U. S. foreign policy along with Israel until the 1979 revolution. And after the 1979 revolution and the breaking of diplomatic relations with Washington, Saudi Arabia and Egypt, to a certain extent, began to fill the vacuum. They became the real allies of Washington. And of course, with the nuclear deal and Iran's reentry into the international community, the Saudis have long feared that Iran would make a comeback and begin to rob it of its place in the region - a problem compounded by the fact that oil prices are down, the U. S. dependence on foreign oil or imported oil is diminishing, that Saudi Arabia is very nervous about its place in the region. You know, both countries have also been rivals in terms of what they want to see happen in the region. And so they're - it's not just the tensions between the two of them but the tensions between their surrogates, their allies in the region, that play out in many of these conflicts. GROSS: So who are the major surrogates? WRIGHT: Well, in Syria, for example, you have Iran backing the regime of President Bashar al-Assad and, of course, its Hezbollah allies in Lebanon who are now fighting in Syria. The Saudis have been supporting the opposition groups that are opposed to Bashar al-Assad. Now, it's not quite as clean as that because the Saudis have - and private Saudis have allegedly been providing funds to some of the Islamist groups, some of which defected to the Islamic State. It gets very messy when anything's involved in the Syrian War right now. But that's one country where their rivalries really play out. And, of course, one of the great achievements by the United States was getting a 17-nation coalition together to talk about peace in the fall that included, for the first time, both foreign ministers from Iran and from Saudi Arabia. And now, of course, they've broken off relations. GROSS: Some experts are speculating that the Saudi's actually wanted other countries to unite against Iran and that they intentionally beheaded the Shiite cleric to provoke Iran and to get people to get other countries to unite against Iran. Is that a credible theory? WRIGHT: It is - there's no question that Saudi Arabia wants to mobilize as many of its Arab allies and even some of its, you know, Western allies against Iran. It wants to check Iran's power in the region. Saudi Arabia is very jealous of Iran. It's a country that has a larger population, a larger military - even though Saudi Arabia has far better equipment - a much larger consumer market. And so it wants to check Iran's reentry into the international community. I don't know about the timing of Sheikh Nimr's execution, but it certainly did not work in favor of peace efforts in the region. GROSS: If you're just joining us, guest is Robin Wright. She writes for The New Yorker, where she covers international affairs. She's written about the Middle East for 43 years. Let's take a short break. Then we'll talk some more. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)GROSS: This is FRESH AIR, and if you're just joining us, my guest is Robin Wright. She's been covering the Middle East for about 43 years. She now writes about international affairs for The New Yorker. And we're talking about the broadening rift between Saudi Arabia and Iran ever since Saudi Arabia executed - beheaded - a Shiite cleric, which led to an Iranian mob to burn down the Saudi Embassy in Iran. And then the Saudis in response broke off relations with Iran. So there's a lot of changes going on in the Saudi kingdom now. King Abdullah died about a year ago after two decades in power. He was succeeded by King Salman, who turns 80 this year and has been reported to have some form of dementia and memory loss. So the new king changed the internal line of power. What are biggest most important changes that the new king has made in Saudi Arabia that's likely to have the largest ripple effects on the region and on the U. S. ? WRIGHT: There's a whole new cast of political players inside Saudi Arabia. And the king did something quite startling in terms of the slow-moving Saudi politics. He fired the crown prince. He named a nephew as the crown prince and his own 30-year-old son as both deputy crown prince and minister of defense - a person who had very limited government experience, was a largely unknown commodity inside the kingdom and invested a huge amount of power particularly in his son. And many of the traditional players in the kingdom were pushed aside. What the king did really was carve out what amounts to a new royal family. The Saudis would deny that, but that's the truth. The founder of Saudi Arabia had 43 sons and even more daughters. And among those 43 sons there were seven sons of one mother, and they're called the Sudairi Seven. The mother was a sudairi. And those seven now are the most powerful players, and one of them is king. And he is kind of carving out a new line of power through the sudairis and through his own family. And there are questions about his frailty on a lot of different levels. And there are questions about how much he's making a lot of the daily decisions. His son has been the one, as the new defense minister, who began engaging in the military campaign in Yemen, a very dangerous and costly proposition, particularly at a time there are real questions about the deficit in Saudi Arabia, that one - about one-third of the young in Saudi Arabia are unemployed. There are - two-thirds of the people who were on the labor force in Saudi Arabia work for the government - that this is a bloated bureaucracy and that the system itself has questions about, as structured now, how long it can endure. Tribalism has never been stronger than it is today in modern Saudi Arabia. And of course that pulls at the fibers, the fabric, of the state. It was the current king's father who pulled together the tribes of Saudi Arabia in the 1920s and created the third version of Saudi Arabia. And there are a lot of questions about the cohesion of the state right now. GROSS: So if the new king has created this new line of power, what is the politics of this new line of power? WRIGHT: Well, look, the Saudi royal family has always been impenetrable when it comes to kind of understanding what the thinking is and what's likely to happen next. But it is clear that the king has bypassed dozens - even hundreds - of other princes who expected to be not only part of the power structure but possibly king and at least included in the perks and privileges of the royal family. There are today somewhere - some people say it's close to - well over 2,000 and some reports claim up to 6,000 princes. And many of them feel that they have been either marginalized or that their - the future generations of their lines of the royal family will not be included in the privileges of the royal family. So you have, you know, an internal dynamic that's playing out in some very interesting ways inside the kingdom at this very vulnerable moment. The kingdom, you know, with the declining price of oil - less than half of what it was a year ago - with the internal disgruntlement over the line of power, with this very bold military campaign in Yemen, with the dangers of ISIS and al-Qaida growing - remember, these have strong Sunni ties, these are both Sunni movements that are a direct threat to the Sunni rule in Saudi Arabia - and now this new showdown with Iran - there's a lot of points of friction inside the kingdom. GROSS: Would you describe the people in this new line of power as being any more or less moderate than their predecessors? WRIGHT: Moderation is not a word I would ever use to describe Saudi Arabia. GROSS: (Laughter) Fair enough. WRIGHT: But I do think that the former king had a reputation - in a Saudi context - as trying to engage in reform - moderate, very small, small steps. He established a new university that is coed. And both boys and girls can go to this, you know, to the same university, which is unprecedented in the kingdom. But women still can't drive. Women are still considered minors all of their lives. To go out of the country, to go to school, to get jobs, they still have to have the written permission of the main man in their life - their father, their husband, even a divorced husband, or son. And so this is a country - and a country that still beheads people. So moderation is not something I'd use. I think that the Saudi regime at the moment is taking pretty hard lines on a lot of things. GROSS: So the current king of Saudi Arabia is in frail health. He's 80. What's likely to happen when he dies - any idea? WRIGHT: That's a big question. And of course there are - the kingdom is full of gossip and speculation. The conspiracy theories are everywhere in the Middle East, but they're particularly strong in Saudi Arabia. And there are those who will argue, look, the son of the king, who's only the deputy crown prince, really has ambitions to succeed his father, and he may not let his uncle take that role. And there are those who think - who will say, well, the uncle, who is the interior minister, a well-known figure in government, who was the one that pushed out al-Qaida - and he's actually kind of the very close ally of the United States - that he won't allow the very young defense minister, the son of the current king, to continue in his role and become his successor. So there's a lot of speculation about what happens next in the kingdom. This is a big moment of transition. GROSS: My guess is Robin Wright, a contributing writer for The New Yorker. We'll talk about political changes in Iran, and the elections scheduled for February, after we take a short break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross, back with Robin Wright. We're talking about the rival powers Saudi Arabia and Iran and the new conflict that was set off this month when Saudi Arabia executed a Shiite cleric, and, in response, an Iranian mob attacked the Saudi Embassy in Tehran. Then the Saudis severed diplomatic relations with Iran. This conflict threatens diplomatic initiatives to end the civil war in Syria and to stop the nuclear weapons program in Iran. To understand what's going on, it's helpful to understand the political changes within Iran and Saudi Arabia, which Robin Wright is explaining for us. Wright has covered the Middle East since 1973 and is a contributing writer at The New Yorker magazine. So we've talked a little bit about how Saudi Arabia is changing, how there's a new king who might be on the way out 'cause he's in ill health, how there's a new line of succession. Iran is undergoing a lot of political changes. There are elections coming up in February. Why are those elections going to be important? WRIGHT: These elections are among the most important since the revolution because they will determine the future of the revolution at a very interesting juncture. For a decade, hardliners in Iran have controlled the basic levers of power. That began to change in 2013 with the election of a centrist president, Hassan Rouhani. Iran's election in February is for two things - first, for parliament, a second branch of government, as well as the Assembly of Experts. This is a group of people very much like the College of Cardinals. There are 86 members. They are religious clerics and scholars, and they are the ones who will pick the next supreme leader. The supreme leader in Iran is 76. He had prostate surgery 18 months ago. He's comparatively sturdy, but the actuarial charts would indicate that this Assembly of Experts, which sits for eight years, may well pick the next supreme leader. And it will probably pick the next supreme leader from among its ranks. So these two elections are really important. If the centrists, reformers, moderates in Iran win parliament - or win more seats in parliament - playing off the gains of the nuclear deal, then you would see two of the three branches of government in the hands of centrists, moderates, reformers. That would be a huge power shift. The third branch of government, being the judiciary, would be the one held in the hands of conservatives and hardliners, and that's not likely to change anytime soon. GROSS: So the demographics of Iran are going to affect, like, who is elected, and the demographics are really changing in Iran. The generation of the 1979 Iranian revolution is getting old. They're on their way out, and a new generation is moving in. And you've written about how when the revolutionaries took over, the government called on women to breed an Islamic generation. And the population grew by about 55 percent in a decade, but then you say the country couldn't feed, clothe, house, educate or find jobs for that many people. So the government reversed course and initiated a drastic family planning program. So you have what sounds like very uneven generational demographics now in Iran, which will certainly affect the voting. Can you talk about that a little bit? WRIGHT: The baby boomers will determine the future of Iran. Today, the majority of the voter population is in that - from that decade when Iran promoted population growth - from the 1980s. And the young today don't talk about the ideal Islamic government. They're much more involved in new startups. I've been in Iran three times in the last 18 months, and I went to see the young twins who started up the equivalent of Amazon in Iran. Today, it's worth a $150 million, and they sell everything from Steinway pianos and perfume to refrigerators and dishwashers, computers that - you know, this is a huge operation. I went to see the 26-year-old woman who had started the Iranian equivalent of Groupon. And the young really have a different agenda. And that's why the revolutionaries, now in their 60s, 70s, even 80s, realize that something different is happening and that the numbers are against them. Now, the interesting thing is when they, after that baby boom spurt that's now between 25 and 35 years old - they then turned around and put in place a birth control program that brought the population down from more than six children per family to under two children per family. And as a result, you don't see the numbers any time soon that are going to challenge this young generation. They will be the determinators for the next 40 or 50 years of Iranian politics because they have the numbers. And so there is an awareness. And one of the reasons the Iranians actually went to the negotiating table was not just because of international sanctions. It was because of their realization for the revolution to survive, they had to provide for the population the things that they wanted. And being a pariah nation, isolated from the world, cut off from trade, with a very savvy young population - you know, literacy is very high in Iran. Sixty-four percent of the university student body is female. You have a totally different dynamic than you did at the time of the revolution. The revolution began to understand they had to deliver to this young generation to survive. GROSS: Well, you've written that Khomeini's grandchildren are all reformers. What does that mean? WRIGHT: It's very interesting. The founder of the revolution has 15 grandchildren among his different children, and they are all reformers. And one of the interesting dynamics is that even his children are in trouble because they have spoken out. The most active grandchild is a woman who tried to run for parliament in 2004. She's a leading women's rights activist. She was disqualified for running as having credentials not Islamic enough, even though she was married to the deputy speaker of parliament at the time, whose brother was president of Iran at the time. And both she and her husband were disqualified. He is an incumbent from running. Khomeini's grandson Hassan Khomeini (ph) is now running for the Assembly of Experts. And there's a lot of controversy about whether the system, which vets all candidates for their Islamic credentials, will actually allow the grandson of the founder of the revolution to run for the Assembly of Experts, who would pick his grandfather's successor. GROSS: So if the baby boom dominates the election and votes more moderately, will Iran have a kind of divided government? WRIGHT: Well, if you have the presidency and parliament agreeing on a national agenda, that makes things a lot easier for President Rouhani to engage in some of the reforms that he's long promised - opening up of the press, individual rights, women's rights. There are a lot of things that people have been waiting for since he was elected in 2013 as he worked on this nuclear deal. If you get the nuclear deal implemented, Iran's pariah status begins to be lifted, and you get a moderate parliament, things could begin to change. The real issue in Iran, since the revolution, has always been the question - is the Islamic Republic of Iran - its full name - first and foremost, Islamic or, first and foremost, a Republic with the ideals of a republic state. Remember, Iran's constitution is based on French and Belgian law with an Islamic component - very strong Islamic component - added to that. And so the debate is always rage not just over international relations, but also in terms of the internal dynamics. What are its priorities? And so this important debate will be the subtext of the election. It's not just over the individuals or moderate versus conservative. It's really - what are our priorities? And there are those hardliners who are probably 20 percent or so of the population who are clinging to that rigid implementation of Islam at the time of the revolution. And they are disproportionately powerful because they have their hands on some of the important instruments of power, some of the important newspapers in Iran. They've, in the past, had the blessing of the supreme leader. They want to cling to those ideals, versus those who say, hey, it's time to move on. It's time to normalize our revolution and be a republic that honors the goals, the democratic values originally promised at the time of the revolution. GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is Robin Wright. She writes for The New Yorker, where she covers international affairs. She's written about the Middle East for 43 years. Let's take a short break, then we'll talk some more. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is Robin Wright. She's a contributing writer for The New Yorker and frequently writes about international affairs. She's been covering the Middle East for many years. So, you can't rewrite the past, and it's really impossible to know if you were able to rewrite the past how it would have changed things. So I'm going to ask you this very speculative question in spite of that. Do you ever find yourself wondering what the Middle East - what the world would look like - if the U. S. had not invaded Iraq? WRIGHT: Oh, I guess I've I wondered about that for a long time. I always thought it was a mistake, and I thought the repercussions would be enduring long after and would be far more significant, for example, than our very costly war in Vietnam. There's no question that it was the greatest mistake in U. S. foreign policy, arguably since we were founded as a nation. I think we're well-intentioned in trying to topple a dictator. Whether that was our role is, of course, debatable. The problem is - and this is true in Afghanistan today as well - we really don't know how to create peace, how to create nations. We were successful with the Europeans after World War II because we provided aid, and they had the skills, the development capabilities, to rebuild their societies - the political will, the unity of purpose. That's not something you find in these far more fragile states in the Middle East that are all - most of them are only a century old. They were carved up from the remains of the Ottoman Empire after World War I. And there are - one of the fundamental questions we all have to ask ourselves is should we, as a nation, use our military might, our economic resources and the human treasure of our military forces to try to preserve these artificial boundaries? I'm not arguing one way or the other, but it's a question we all should ask because the map of the Middle East is rapidly disintegrating. And it's not clear that some of the countries, anywany, are going to be viable long-term. So the repercussions of Iraq and the way it is played out - we never would've had al-Qaida in Iraq if it hadn't been for our invasion. We never would have had the creation of ISIS, a branch of al-Qaida that broke away and formed its own, even more lethal group, if it hadn't been for the invasion of Iraq. So I wonder all the time, and I weep all the time over what this will cost us as a nation. And I wonder sometimes if it will be that moment in history where historians say we began to lose our greatness. GROSS: We as a nation - the U. S. ? WRIGHT: That we as a nation began to lose our way, our mission and - yeah. GROSS: You know, I've heard a lot of people talking about dictators in the Middle East and was the Middle East actually better off with dictators than with the chaos and civil wars and ISIS and the other radical armed groups that are taking over parts of the region. So I'd love to hear you talk about that. I mean, the U. S. overthrew Saddam Hussein, and several years after that you have the Arab Spring, in which people rose up in Egypt and Tunisia and several other countries including Syria to overthrow or attempt to overthrow dictators. And, I mean, there's chaos through so much of the region now. It's a horrible choice, you know - chaos, civil war versus dictator. Who would choose either of those? But how do you wait the balance? WRIGHT: You know, it would be arrogant of me to make the call about what serves the people of the region best. It's only fair to ask those who live there and who have suffered under both dictators and during warfare. We never learned how to deal with people in the region in a way that lets their priorities rule. We always want to create countries or systems that reflect what we do. And as a result, when we went into Iraq, the classic mistake was we disbanded the political party to which everybody had to belong - whether it was to get a job as a kindergarten teacher or a garbage collector - and we created a country from scratch. And we brought in people to make those decision who were exiles - who had abandoned their own country. We don't know how to help locals effectively build viable models. And we're impatient. We kind of want to switch on a light. It's just like with Gadhafi in Libya. We went in with a NATO coalition for eight months at enormous cost to pound the place to get rid of Gadhafi and push him out of power. And then we kind of walked away. And today, Libya is a terrible mess with, you know, dozens of militias. You have ISIS. And this is a country that has enormous oil wealth - was the one country that could have produced and rebuilt on its own because of its oil wealth - with a very small population, only 6 million. And yet we abandoned it. We just haven't figured out the balance of what's the right role. And frankly, the international community has really defaulted to the United States to take on that role, and then they want to blame us when we don't do it well. GROSS: Do you ever feel like stability in the Middle East is just hopeless? Like, you've been covering that region for over 43 years and things seem to just keep getting worse in a way. WRIGHT: I ultimately think that the Middle East is no different than the other regions of the world, and that part of the change that it's going through is part and parcel of what we've seen in the last 40 years with the collapse of minority rule, colonial rule and Apartheid in Africa, the collapse of military dictatorships in Latin America, the end of Communism in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union - that there is this wave of change as in the late 20th and early 21st century you see people understanding their rights - that they are entitled to have a say in their political life, in access to economic opportunity and to justice. And that's really the common thread that goes through this critical moment in history. You know, centuries from now, people will look at this period in terms of the commonalities. Now, the Middle East has been more volatile in part because of the religious components and also because the outside world - in part because of oil, we have to be honest about that - has backed autocratic rule. We wanted stability in a region where we needed their petroleum resources. And so we tolerated - whether it's the monarchy, an absolute authoritarian monarchy in Saudi Arabia, or the kind of autocratic rule we've seen in Egypt - you know, the dictators that prevailed until the Arab Spring. I think the Arab Spring is part and parcel, again, of this - whether it's the - just like the anti-Apartheid movement in South Africa, the rising up of the unions in a place like Brazil against a military dictatorship - it's all part of the same phenomenon. The problem in all of these countries, of course, is that their people understand their rights, but the other half of empowerment is understanding the common good and the sense of responsibility. And in the kind of headiness of saying, hey, I deserve my rights, and getting out in the streets to demand it, people are not thinking about, well, what's the alternative? How do we come together to create a viable alternative that does represent the vast majority of the people? And so that's why we're seeing this fractious period across the world and most of all the Middle East. But I don't think the Middle East is an exceptional part of the region. I mean, ironically the Arab-Israeli conflict - or the Palestinian-Israeli conflict - is one of the smaller conflicts. And frankly, when you look at what's along Israel's borders, the Palestinian's is one of the comparatively more stable borders. So I ultimately think this will be resolved, but I also think it's going to be a long time before any of these transitions are going to play out and we're in a place where we feel more comfortable. This is the story of the 21st century. GROSS: Let's end by talking about pizza and hamburgers. On a recent trip to Iran, you went to a knockoff of a Pizza Hut and a knockoff of a McDonald's. What are those franchises called in Iran? WRIGHT: The pizza place is called Pizza Hot, which is a rip-off of Pizza Hut. And there are 14 franchises in Iran, and they have the same boxes, the same logo, the same uniforms. It's very funny. You go in and it's the same menu. And then there's also Mash Donald's. Mash is a shortened version of Mashhad, which is the holy city of - one of the holy cities. It's a site of pilgrimage in Iran. So Mash is somebody who's done the pilgrimage to Mashhad. So they've done it Mash Donald's. And they have big Ronald McDonalds and all the kind of, you know, the toys and stuff that go along with it. I will say I got food poisoning there, and I don't recommend it to anybody. But it is a reflection of the fact that they may still shout, death to America, in Iran but there is also this longing to be back in some kind of relationship with America again. GROSS: Robin Wright, thank you so much for talking with us. WRIGHT: Thank you, Terry. GROSS: Robin Wright is a contributing writer at The New Yorker magazine and is a joint fellow at the U. S. Institute of Peace and the Woodrow Wilson International Center. Our film critic, David Edelstein, will review the new Charlie Kaufman film, Anomalisa, after we take a short break. This is FRESH AIR. TERRY GROSS, HOST:  This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Just as there seemed to be some diplomatic progress in the Middle East, with the deal over Iran's nuclear program about to be implemented and talks for a political resolution to the civil war in Syria planned to start this month, those efforts are being jeopardized by a new conflict. That conflict has erupted between two rival nations in the region - Iran and Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia executed a Shiite cleric on January 2. In response, an Iranian mob attacked the Saudi Embassy in Tehran. Then the Saudis severed diplomatic ties with Iran. My guest is journalist Robin Wright, who has been covering the region since 1973 and has reported on every war in the region since then. She's now a contributing writer for The New Yorker and is a joint fellow at the U. S. Institute of Peace and the Woodrow Wilson International Center. Her books include \"Rock The Casbah: Rage And Rebellion Across The Islamic World\" and \"Dreams And Shadows: The Future Of The Middle East. \" Robin Wright, welcome to FRESH AIR. Before we talk about the repercussions of this new rift between Iran and Saudi Arabia, let's talk about what caused it. The Saudis beheaded a Shiite cleric named Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr. Who was he and why did the Saudis say they beheaded him? ROBIN WRIGHT: Sheikh Nimr was a prominent critic of the monarchy. He was a leading cleric of the Shiite sect inside Saudi Arabia. The Shiites make between 10 and 15 percent of Saudi Arabia's population, but they also live in the most important part of Saudi Arabia, which are the eastern oil fields. They live and work in the Eastern Provinces and have long felt that they don't reap the benefits or rewards of the resources on their own territory, whether it's the financial benefits, the social infrastructure, you know, health benefits, or whether it's a role in the political structure. And so for more than three decades, there have been bubbling movements that have risen and fallen over time to try to challenge the government over Shiite rights. The Saudi monarchy is Sunni. Saudi Arabia is the guardian of Islam's holy places. There is a long-standing tension between Sunni and Shiites over the interpretation of Islam - who should be the leaders, what is the proper doctrine, the proper interpretation of Islam. So the friction inside the kingdom comes in context of this long-standing division. Sheikh Nimr was a critic, but he had not been involved physically in violence. He had sympathized with the people, he had been - used pretty tough language when it came to criticizing the monarchy. He called it authoritarian and reactionary and said that - told American diplomats who interviewed him in 2008 that he would always side with the people against the government if it ever came to some kind of confrontation. He became controversial in 2012, in the aftermath of a new round of protests in the kingdom that were spawned in large part by the Arab Spring, as the protests began to spread across the entire Arab world. And he was arrested at that time. He was charged with a number of offenses, including the absence of loyalty to the ruler, fomenting dissent and inciting public violence. So this is - that's the core of the offenses that led to his execution on January 2. GROSS: So he was beheaded. Is beheading a typical punishment in Saudi Arabia? Is that their form of capital punishment? WRIGHT: The 47 men who were executed on January 2 were all either beheaded or put in front of firing squads. Beheading is a common practice in the kingdom. And, in fact, some of the various punishments - whether it's beheading or chopping off an arm or a leg for various other crimes, including robbery - are often done in public squares in the kingdom to drive home the point that these are costly offenses. GROSS: So in response to the beheading of the sheikh, an Iranian mob burned down the Saudi Embassy in Iran. And again, the sheikh was Shiite; Iran is a Shiite country. The sheikh had studied in Iran. So after the Iranian mob burned down the Saudi Embassy in Iran, the Saudis broke off diplomatic relations with Iran. So what events - like, what ongoing diplomatic events and talks does this falling-out between Iran and Saudi Arabia - not that their relationship was good before this, but it's worse now - so what does this put in jeopardy in the region? WRIGHT: Well, the timing of this confrontation is really dangerous because January was to be the month of developments, important developments, on four different peace initiatives that were really part of the international effort to prevent the Middle East from disintegrating completely. The first is the anticipated peace talks between the Syrian government and the Syrian opposition on January 25. This is the political complement to the military campaign against the Islamic State. This is the package of initiatives designed to hold Syria together to end what is the greatest humanitarian crisis and the bloodiest conflict in the world right now. The second one is the peace talks on the Yemen. Again, an enormous humanitarian crisis - 80 percent of the people in Yemen no longer have access to fresh water and are dependent on humanitarian aid to eat. And so the peace talks - a second round of peace talks - were supposed to happen this month. A cease-fire went into place last month. But on the same day that the Shiite cleric was executed, the Saudi-led coalition announced it was no longer going to comply with the cease-fire. And that, of course, jeopardizes the peace effort and any attempt to engage in another cease-fire. The third is the very important progress made last month by the Iraqi government in pushing back ISIS from the strategic town of Ramadi, and making some political gains as well. And this is a moment where the entire region, and particularly Saudi Arabia and Iran, have interest - and in some cases, rival interests. And the fourth very important - especially for the United States - is the Iran nuclear deal, which was expected to be formally implemented this month, which means Iran will have complied with dismantling some of its program, shipping out its low-enriched uranium, limiting the number of centrifuges used to enrich uranium, and then the lifting of sanctions. This was a moment that Iran was going to kind of begin to end its pariah status. And all these things suddenly are on the table because of the deepening rift between the two Islamic powers in the Middle East. GROSS: Well, why does that rift jeopardize, for instance, the Iranian nuclear deal? WRIGHT: Well, the Saudis have long been opposed to a nuclear deal with Iran, not just because of the nuclear deal or the terms of the deal. This - all this goes back to the long-standing rivalry between these two Gulf powers. And on a lot of different levels they are - it's the Shiite-Sunni rift that dates back 14 centuries but has taken on a kind of new face over the last few decades but particularly in the last couple of years. It's the long-standing rivalry between Persians in Iran and Arabs in Gulf countries. It plays out, you know, in terms of their relationship with the outside world. Remember, Iran was one of the two pillars of U. S. foreign policy along with Israel until the 1979 revolution. And after the 1979 revolution and the breaking of diplomatic relations with Washington, Saudi Arabia and Egypt, to a certain extent, began to fill the vacuum. They became the real allies of Washington. And of course, with the nuclear deal and Iran's reentry into the international community, the Saudis have long feared that Iran would make a comeback and begin to rob it of its place in the region - a problem compounded by the fact that oil prices are down, the U. S. dependence on foreign oil or imported oil is diminishing, that Saudi Arabia is very nervous about its place in the region. You know, both countries have also been rivals in terms of what they want to see happen in the region. And so they're - it's not just the tensions between the two of them but the tensions between their surrogates, their allies in the region, that play out in many of these conflicts. GROSS: So who are the major surrogates? WRIGHT: Well, in Syria, for example, you have Iran backing the regime of President Bashar al-Assad and, of course, its Hezbollah allies in Lebanon who are now fighting in Syria. The Saudis have been supporting the opposition groups that are opposed to Bashar al-Assad. Now, it's not quite as clean as that because the Saudis have - and private Saudis have allegedly been providing funds to some of the Islamist groups, some of which defected to the Islamic State. It gets very messy when anything's involved in the Syrian War right now. But that's one country where their rivalries really play out. And, of course, one of the great achievements by the United States was getting a 17-nation coalition together to talk about peace in the fall that included, for the first time, both foreign ministers from Iran and from Saudi Arabia. And now, of course, they've broken off relations. GROSS: Some experts are speculating that the Saudi's actually wanted other countries to unite against Iran and that they intentionally beheaded the Shiite cleric to provoke Iran and to get people to get other countries to unite against Iran. Is that a credible theory? WRIGHT: It is - there's no question that Saudi Arabia wants to mobilize as many of its Arab allies and even some of its, you know, Western allies against Iran. It wants to check Iran's power in the region. Saudi Arabia is very jealous of Iran. It's a country that has a larger population, a larger military - even though Saudi Arabia has far better equipment - a much larger consumer market. And so it wants to check Iran's reentry into the international community. I don't know about the timing of Sheikh Nimr's execution, but it certainly did not work in favor of peace efforts in the region. GROSS: If you're just joining us, guest is Robin Wright. She writes for The New Yorker, where she covers international affairs. She's written about the Middle East for 43 years. Let's take a short break. Then we'll talk some more. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GROSS: This is FRESH AIR, and if you're just joining us, my guest is Robin Wright. She's been covering the Middle East for about 43 years. She now writes about international affairs for The New Yorker. And we're talking about the broadening rift between Saudi Arabia and Iran ever since Saudi Arabia executed - beheaded - a Shiite cleric, which led to an Iranian mob to burn down the Saudi Embassy in Iran. And then the Saudis in response broke off relations with Iran. So there's a lot of changes going on in the Saudi kingdom now. King Abdullah died about a year ago after two decades in power. He was succeeded by King Salman, who turns 80 this year and has been reported to have some form of dementia and memory loss. So the new king changed the internal line of power. What are biggest most important changes that the new king has made in Saudi Arabia that's likely to have the largest ripple effects on the region and on the U. S. ? WRIGHT: There's a whole new cast of political players inside Saudi Arabia. And the king did something quite startling in terms of the slow-moving Saudi politics. He fired the crown prince. He named a nephew as the crown prince and his own 30-year-old son as both deputy crown prince and minister of defense - a person who had very limited government experience, was a largely unknown commodity inside the kingdom and invested a huge amount of power particularly in his son. And many of the traditional players in the kingdom were pushed aside. What the king did really was carve out what amounts to a new royal family. The Saudis would deny that, but that's the truth. The founder of Saudi Arabia had 43 sons and even more daughters. And among those 43 sons there were seven sons of one mother, and they're called the Sudairi Seven. The mother was a sudairi. And those seven now are the most powerful players, and one of them is king. And he is kind of carving out a new line of power through the sudairis and through his own family. And there are questions about his frailty on a lot of different levels. And there are questions about how much he's making a lot of the daily decisions. His son has been the one, as the new defense minister, who began engaging in the military campaign in Yemen, a very dangerous and costly proposition, particularly at a time there are real questions about the deficit in Saudi Arabia, that one - about one-third of the young in Saudi Arabia are unemployed. There are - two-thirds of the people who were on the labor force in Saudi Arabia work for the government - that this is a bloated bureaucracy and that the system itself has questions about, as structured now, how long it can endure. Tribalism has never been stronger than it is today in modern Saudi Arabia. And of course that pulls at the fibers, the fabric, of the state. It was the current king's father who pulled together the tribes of Saudi Arabia in the 1920s and created the third version of Saudi Arabia. And there are a lot of questions about the cohesion of the state right now. GROSS: So if the new king has created this new line of power, what is the politics of this new line of power? WRIGHT: Well, look, the Saudi royal family has always been impenetrable when it comes to kind of understanding what the thinking is and what's likely to happen next. But it is clear that the king has bypassed dozens - even hundreds - of other princes who expected to be not only part of the power structure but possibly king and at least included in the perks and privileges of the royal family. There are today somewhere - some people say it's close to - well over 2,000 and some reports claim up to 6,000 princes. And many of them feel that they have been either marginalized or that their - the future generations of their lines of the royal family will not be included in the privileges of the royal family. So you have, you know, an internal dynamic that's playing out in some very interesting ways inside the kingdom at this very vulnerable moment. The kingdom, you know, with the declining price of oil - less than half of what it was a year ago - with the internal disgruntlement over the line of power, with this very bold military campaign in Yemen, with the dangers of ISIS and al-Qaida growing - remember, these have strong Sunni ties, these are both Sunni movements that are a direct threat to the Sunni rule in Saudi Arabia - and now this new showdown with Iran - there's a lot of points of friction inside the kingdom. GROSS: Would you describe the people in this new line of power as being any more or less moderate than their predecessors? WRIGHT: Moderation is not a word I would ever use to describe Saudi Arabia. GROSS: (Laughter) Fair enough. WRIGHT: But I do think that the former king had a reputation - in a Saudi context - as trying to engage in reform - moderate, very small, small steps. He established a new university that is coed. And both boys and girls can go to this, you know, to the same university, which is unprecedented in the kingdom. But women still can't drive. Women are still considered minors all of their lives. To go out of the country, to go to school, to get jobs, they still have to have the written permission of the main man in their life - their father, their husband, even a divorced husband, or son. And so this is a country - and a country that still beheads people. So moderation is not something I'd use. I think that the Saudi regime at the moment is taking pretty hard lines on a lot of things. GROSS: So the current king of Saudi Arabia is in frail health. He's 80. What's likely to happen when he dies - any idea? WRIGHT: That's a big question. And of course there are - the kingdom is full of gossip and speculation. The conspiracy theories are everywhere in the Middle East, but they're particularly strong in Saudi Arabia. And there are those who will argue, look, the son of the king, who's only the deputy crown prince, really has ambitions to succeed his father, and he may not let his uncle take that role. And there are those who think - who will say, well, the uncle, who is the interior minister, a well-known figure in government, who was the one that pushed out al-Qaida - and he's actually kind of the very close ally of the United States - that he won't allow the very young defense minister, the son of the current king, to continue in his role and become his successor. So there's a lot of speculation about what happens next in the kingdom. This is a big moment of transition. GROSS: My guess is Robin Wright, a contributing writer for The New Yorker. We'll talk about political changes in Iran, and the elections scheduled for February, after we take a short break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross, back with Robin Wright. We're talking about the rival powers Saudi Arabia and Iran and the new conflict that was set off this month when Saudi Arabia executed a Shiite cleric, and, in response, an Iranian mob attacked the Saudi Embassy in Tehran. Then the Saudis severed diplomatic relations with Iran. This conflict threatens diplomatic initiatives to end the civil war in Syria and to stop the nuclear weapons program in Iran. To understand what's going on, it's helpful to understand the political changes within Iran and Saudi Arabia, which Robin Wright is explaining for us. Wright has covered the Middle East since 1973 and is a contributing writer at The New Yorker magazine. So we've talked a little bit about how Saudi Arabia is changing, how there's a new king who might be on the way out 'cause he's in ill health, how there's a new line of succession. Iran is undergoing a lot of political changes. There are elections coming up in February. Why are those elections going to be important? WRIGHT: These elections are among the most important since the revolution because they will determine the future of the revolution at a very interesting juncture. For a decade, hardliners in Iran have controlled the basic levers of power. That began to change in 2013 with the election of a centrist president, Hassan Rouhani. Iran's election in February is for two things - first, for parliament, a second branch of government, as well as the Assembly of Experts. This is a group of people very much like the College of Cardinals. There are 86 members. They are religious clerics and scholars, and they are the ones who will pick the next supreme leader. The supreme leader in Iran is 76. He had prostate surgery 18 months ago. He's comparatively sturdy, but the actuarial charts would indicate that this Assembly of Experts, which sits for eight years, may well pick the next supreme leader. And it will probably pick the next supreme leader from among its ranks. So these two elections are really important. If the centrists, reformers, moderates in Iran win parliament - or win more seats in parliament - playing off the gains of the nuclear deal, then you would see two of the three branches of government in the hands of centrists, moderates, reformers. That would be a huge power shift. The third branch of government, being the judiciary, would be the one held in the hands of conservatives and hardliners, and that's not likely to change anytime soon. GROSS: So the demographics of Iran are going to affect, like, who is elected, and the demographics are really changing in Iran. The generation of the 1979 Iranian revolution is getting old. They're on their way out, and a new generation is moving in. And you've written about how when the revolutionaries took over, the government called on women to breed an Islamic generation. And the population grew by about 55 percent in a decade, but then you say the country couldn't feed, clothe, house, educate or find jobs for that many people. So the government reversed course and initiated a drastic family planning program. So you have what sounds like very uneven generational demographics now in Iran, which will certainly affect the voting. Can you talk about that a little bit? WRIGHT: The baby boomers will determine the future of Iran. Today, the majority of the voter population is in that - from that decade when Iran promoted population growth - from the 1980s. And the young today don't talk about the ideal Islamic government. They're much more involved in new startups. I've been in Iran three times in the last 18 months, and I went to see the young twins who started up the equivalent of Amazon in Iran. Today, it's worth a $150 million, and they sell everything from Steinway pianos and perfume to refrigerators and dishwashers, computers that - you know, this is a huge operation. I went to see the 26-year-old woman who had started the Iranian equivalent of Groupon. And the young really have a different agenda. And that's why the revolutionaries, now in their 60s, 70s, even 80s, realize that something different is happening and that the numbers are against them. Now, the interesting thing is when they, after that baby boom spurt that's now between 25 and 35 years old - they then turned around and put in place a birth control program that brought the population down from more than six children per family to under two children per family. And as a result, you don't see the numbers any time soon that are going to challenge this young generation. They will be the determinators for the next 40 or 50 years of Iranian politics because they have the numbers. And so there is an awareness. And one of the reasons the Iranians actually went to the negotiating table was not just because of international sanctions. It was because of their realization for the revolution to survive, they had to provide for the population the things that they wanted. And being a pariah nation, isolated from the world, cut off from trade, with a very savvy young population - you know, literacy is very high in Iran. Sixty-four percent of the university student body is female. You have a totally different dynamic than you did at the time of the revolution. The revolution began to understand they had to deliver to this young generation to survive. GROSS: Well, you've written that Khomeini's grandchildren are all reformers. What does that mean? WRIGHT: It's very interesting. The founder of the revolution has 15 grandchildren among his different children, and they are all reformers. And one of the interesting dynamics is that even his children are in trouble because they have spoken out. The most active grandchild is a woman who tried to run for parliament in 2004. She's a leading women's rights activist. She was disqualified for running as having credentials not Islamic enough, even though she was married to the deputy speaker of parliament at the time, whose brother was president of Iran at the time. And both she and her husband were disqualified. He is an incumbent from running. Khomeini's grandson Hassan Khomeini (ph) is now running for the Assembly of Experts. And there's a lot of controversy about whether the system, which vets all candidates for their Islamic credentials, will actually allow the grandson of the founder of the revolution to run for the Assembly of Experts, who would pick his grandfather's successor. GROSS: So if the baby boom dominates the election and votes more moderately, will Iran have a kind of divided government? WRIGHT: Well, if you have the presidency and parliament agreeing on a national agenda, that makes things a lot easier for President Rouhani to engage in some of the reforms that he's long promised - opening up of the press, individual rights, women's rights. There are a lot of things that people have been waiting for since he was elected in 2013 as he worked on this nuclear deal. If you get the nuclear deal implemented, Iran's pariah status begins to be lifted, and you get a moderate parliament, things could begin to change. The real issue in Iran, since the revolution, has always been the question - is the Islamic Republic of Iran - its full name - first and foremost, Islamic or, first and foremost, a Republic with the ideals of a republic state. Remember, Iran's constitution is based on French and Belgian law with an Islamic component - very strong Islamic component - added to that. And so the debate is always rage not just over international relations, but also in terms of the internal dynamics. What are its priorities? And so this important debate will be the subtext of the election. It's not just over the individuals or moderate versus conservative. It's really - what are our priorities? And there are those hardliners who are probably 20 percent or so of the population who are clinging to that rigid implementation of Islam at the time of the revolution. And they are disproportionately powerful because they have their hands on some of the important instruments of power, some of the important newspapers in Iran. They've, in the past, had the blessing of the supreme leader. They want to cling to those ideals, versus those who say, hey, it's time to move on. It's time to normalize our revolution and be a republic that honors the goals, the democratic values originally promised at the time of the revolution. GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is Robin Wright. She writes for The New Yorker, where she covers international affairs. She's written about the Middle East for 43 years. Let's take a short break, then we'll talk some more. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is Robin Wright. She's a contributing writer for The New Yorker and frequently writes about international affairs. She's been covering the Middle East for many years. So, you can't rewrite the past, and it's really impossible to know if you were able to rewrite the past how it would have changed things. So I'm going to ask you this very speculative question in spite of that. Do you ever find yourself wondering what the Middle East - what the world would look like - if the U. S. had not invaded Iraq? WRIGHT: Oh, I guess I've I wondered about that for a long time. I always thought it was a mistake, and I thought the repercussions would be enduring long after and would be far more significant, for example, than our very costly war in Vietnam. There's no question that it was the greatest mistake in U. S. foreign policy, arguably since we were founded as a nation. I think we're well-intentioned in trying to topple a dictator. Whether that was our role is, of course, debatable. The problem is - and this is true in Afghanistan today as well - we really don't know how to create peace, how to create nations. We were successful with the Europeans after World War II because we provided aid, and they had the skills, the development capabilities, to rebuild their societies - the political will, the unity of purpose. That's not something you find in these far more fragile states in the Middle East that are all - most of them are only a century old. They were carved up from the remains of the Ottoman Empire after World War I. And there are - one of the fundamental questions we all have to ask ourselves is should we, as a nation, use our military might, our economic resources and the human treasure of our military forces to try to preserve these artificial boundaries? I'm not arguing one way or the other, but it's a question we all should ask because the map of the Middle East is rapidly disintegrating. And it's not clear that some of the countries, anywany, are going to be viable long-term. So the repercussions of Iraq and the way it is played out - we never would've had al-Qaida in Iraq if it hadn't been for our invasion. We never would have had the creation of ISIS, a branch of al-Qaida that broke away and formed its own, even more lethal group, if it hadn't been for the invasion of Iraq. So I wonder all the time, and I weep all the time over what this will cost us as a nation. And I wonder sometimes if it will be that moment in history where historians say we began to lose our greatness. GROSS: We as a nation - the U. S. ? WRIGHT: That we as a nation began to lose our way, our mission and - yeah. GROSS: You know, I've heard a lot of people talking about dictators in the Middle East and was the Middle East actually better off with dictators than with the chaos and civil wars and ISIS and the other radical armed groups that are taking over parts of the region. So I'd love to hear you talk about that. I mean, the U. S. overthrew Saddam Hussein, and several years after that you have the Arab Spring, in which people rose up in Egypt and Tunisia and several other countries including Syria to overthrow or attempt to overthrow dictators. And, I mean, there's chaos through so much of the region now. It's a horrible choice, you know - chaos, civil war versus dictator. Who would choose either of those? But how do you wait the balance? WRIGHT: You know, it would be arrogant of me to make the call about what serves the people of the region best. It's only fair to ask those who live there and who have suffered under both dictators and during warfare. We never learned how to deal with people in the region in a way that lets their priorities rule. We always want to create countries or systems that reflect what we do. And as a result, when we went into Iraq, the classic mistake was we disbanded the political party to which everybody had to belong - whether it was to get a job as a kindergarten teacher or a garbage collector - and we created a country from scratch. And we brought in people to make those decision who were exiles - who had abandoned their own country. We don't know how to help locals effectively build viable models. And we're impatient. We kind of want to switch on a light. It's just like with Gadhafi in Libya. We went in with a NATO coalition for eight months at enormous cost to pound the place to get rid of Gadhafi and push him out of power. And then we kind of walked away. And today, Libya is a terrible mess with, you know, dozens of militias. You have ISIS. And this is a country that has enormous oil wealth - was the one country that could have produced and rebuilt on its own because of its oil wealth - with a very small population, only 6 million. And yet we abandoned it. We just haven't figured out the balance of what's the right role. And frankly, the international community has really defaulted to the United States to take on that role, and then they want to blame us when we don't do it well. GROSS: Do you ever feel like stability in the Middle East is just hopeless? Like, you've been covering that region for over 43 years and things seem to just keep getting worse in a way. WRIGHT: I ultimately think that the Middle East is no different than the other regions of the world, and that part of the change that it's going through is part and parcel of what we've seen in the last 40 years with the collapse of minority rule, colonial rule and Apartheid in Africa, the collapse of military dictatorships in Latin America, the end of Communism in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union - that there is this wave of change as in the late 20th and early 21st century you see people understanding their rights - that they are entitled to have a say in their political life, in access to economic opportunity and to justice. And that's really the common thread that goes through this critical moment in history. You know, centuries from now, people will look at this period in terms of the commonalities. Now, the Middle East has been more volatile in part because of the religious components and also because the outside world - in part because of oil, we have to be honest about that - has backed autocratic rule. We wanted stability in a region where we needed their petroleum resources. And so we tolerated - whether it's the monarchy, an absolute authoritarian monarchy in Saudi Arabia, or the kind of autocratic rule we've seen in Egypt - you know, the dictators that prevailed until the Arab Spring. I think the Arab Spring is part and parcel, again, of this - whether it's the - just like the anti-Apartheid movement in South Africa, the rising up of the unions in a place like Brazil against a military dictatorship - it's all part of the same phenomenon. The problem in all of these countries, of course, is that their people understand their rights, but the other half of empowerment is understanding the common good and the sense of responsibility. And in the kind of headiness of saying, hey, I deserve my rights, and getting out in the streets to demand it, people are not thinking about, well, what's the alternative? How do we come together to create a viable alternative that does represent the vast majority of the people? And so that's why we're seeing this fractious period across the world and most of all the Middle East. But I don't think the Middle East is an exceptional part of the region. I mean, ironically the Arab-Israeli conflict - or the Palestinian-Israeli conflict - is one of the smaller conflicts. And frankly, when you look at what's along Israel's borders, the Palestinian's is one of the comparatively more stable borders. So I ultimately think this will be resolved, but I also think it's going to be a long time before any of these transitions are going to play out and we're in a place where we feel more comfortable. This is the story of the 21st century. GROSS: Let's end by talking about pizza and hamburgers. On a recent trip to Iran, you went to a knockoff of a Pizza Hut and a knockoff of a McDonald's. What are those franchises called in Iran? WRIGHT: The pizza place is called Pizza Hot, which is a rip-off of Pizza Hut. And there are 14 franchises in Iran, and they have the same boxes, the same logo, the same uniforms. It's very funny. You go in and it's the same menu. And then there's also Mash Donald's. Mash is a shortened version of Mashhad, which is the holy city of - one of the holy cities. It's a site of pilgrimage in Iran. So Mash is somebody who's done the pilgrimage to Mashhad. So they've done it Mash Donald's. And they have big Ronald McDonalds and all the kind of, you know, the toys and stuff that go along with it. I will say I got food poisoning there, and I don't recommend it to anybody. But it is a reflection of the fact that they may still shout, death to America, in Iran but there is also this longing to be back in some kind of relationship with America again. GROSS: Robin Wright, thank you so much for talking with us. WRIGHT: Thank you, Terry. GROSS: Robin Wright is a contributing writer at The New Yorker magazine and is a joint fellow at the U. S. Institute of Peace and the Woodrow Wilson International Center. Our film critic, David Edelstein, will review the new Charlie Kaufman film, Anomalisa, after we take a short break.

But unfortunately, that is not the whole story. ROBERT MUGGAH: I that think we're hypnotized about the promise of cities. And we're mesmerized by these extraordinarily livable cities in North America and parts of Western Europe. RAZ: This is Robert Muggah. MUGGAH: But the vast majority of world's population doesn't live in those cities. In fact, most people live in Africa, in Asia, in Latin America. And that's where virtually all of future population growth - especially in cities - is going to take place. RAZ: Robert travels the developing world, and he looks at how cities in those places are growing, and why so many of them are struggling with violence and crime. And he studies how those cities are trying to figure out how to tackle those problems. Here's Robert Muggah on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)MUGGAH: For the last 20 years, I've been working in countries and cities ripped apart by conflict, violence, terrorism or some insidious combination of all of them. I've tracked gun smugglers from Russia to Somalia. I've worked with warlords in Afghanistan and the Congo. I've counted cadavers in Colombia, in Haiti, in Sri Lanka, in Papua New Guinea. Some diplomats and development experts and specialists, they talk about 40 to 50 fragile states that will shape security in the 21st century. I think it's fragile cities which will define the future of order and disorder. Aleppo, Bamako, Caracas, Erbil, Mosul, Tripoli, Salvador - violence is migrating to the metropole. That's because warfare and humanitarian action are going to be concentrated in our cities. And the fight for development - whether you define that as eradicating poverty, universal healthcare, beating back climate change - will be won or lost in the shantytowns, slums and favelas of our cities. RAZ: Can you describe a fragile city that you've been to and what it's like? MUGGAH: So I live in Rio de Janeiro, which in some ways, you know, straddles the idea of a global gateway city as well as a fragile city. And it's a wonderful city. You know, on the one hand it's the city of samba, it's the city of tourism. It's a beautiful city. On the other hand, it's a city of extraordinary inequality where, you know, high-rises abut some of the most depraved and poor neighborhoods one could possibly fathom, where you have high rates of violence, you know - I mean, levels of violence that are equivalent in some places to war zones. So I have a complex and contested relationship with this city that seems to be on the one hand to thrive, and on the other hand seems to always plumb the depths and seems to devour itself. RAZ: So how can a city survive that sort of struggle - even thrive in the face of crime and corruption? Robert Muggah returns with answers in a moment. On the show today, \"Building Better Cities. \" I'm Guy Raz, and you're listening to the TED RADIO HOUR from NPR. RAZ: It's the TED RADIO HOUR from NPR. I'm Guy Raz. And on the show today, ideas about building better cities. And we were just hearing from Robert Muggah. He studies some of the most fragile cities in the world - these places where crime and violence can threaten the entire city's survival. But Robert is also looking at how those cities are tackling those problems. MUGGAH: You know, although I live and occupy a realm of a certain measure of pessimism, I am optimistic when I look at some of the inspired leadership of mayors around the world who've managed to turn things around. RAZ: How much do you sort of believe in this idea that solutions come from cities - that actually things that are developed locally are often, you know, the best way of handling problems? MUGGAH: Yeah, and I think where you've seen some of the greatest innovation coming from fragile cities is in thinking differently about the structure of the city and how different parts of the city interact - by bringing low-income areas in contact with high income areas, by rethinking transportation to make transportation much more predictable and accessible, by building not just haphazard public, you know, utilities or community centers or libraries, but really investing in top-notch and high-quality public infrastructure to get people who live in that city to feel like they're part of the city - to feel that they own the city. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)MUGGAH: We've got to get away from this model of segregation, exclusion and cities with walls. My favorite example of how to do this comes from Medellin. When I lived in Colombia in the late 1990s, Medellin was the murder capital of the world. But it changed course. And it did this by deliberately investing in its low-income and most violent areas, and integrating them with the middle-class one through a network of cable cars - of public transport and first-class infrastructure. And in the process, it dropped homicide by 79 percent in just under two decades. There's wonderful work that's happening that I've been involved with in Kingston, Jamaica, and right here in Rio, which is putting education, employment, recreation up front for these high-risk groups. And as a result, we're seeing violence going down in their communities. We can also focus on hotspots. Did you know that between 1 and 2 percent of street addresses in any fragile city can predict up to 99 percent of violent crime? Take the case of Sao Paulo, where I've been working. It's gone from being Brazil's most dangerous city to one of its safest. And it did this by doubling down on information collection, hotspot mapping and police reform. And in the process, it dropped homicide by 70 percent in just over 10 years. RAZ: You describe the case of S\u00e3o Paulo. You mention Kingston, Jamaica, and Rio. Have you seen, you know, like, these kinds of approaches spread to other fragile cities? MUGGAH: Yeah, and I guess that's why I'm kind of hopeful. I think this information technology revolution has meant that there's been almost a democratization of these kinds of tools used both by police, but also by citizens, not just in the West, but spread out through the South and East. And so some of the most inspiring and, I think, exciting examples of the use of these tools are happening in cities that are ostensibly fragile - as in, you know, Medellin or Sao Paulo or Rio or even in Nairobi and other parts of Africa. RAZ: Yeah, because, I mean, cities are laboratories. I mean, they are - even fragile cities are laboratories. I mean, they're places where big-scale problems can be tackled - or can be attempted to be tackled. MUGGAH: I think that's right. And so I think what we're seeing now is - and it's an exciting evolution - is that it's no longer just Mayor Bloomberg who is coming down to, you know, Rio de Janeiro or Bogota to explain to them the wonders of the New York model. It's actually Mayor Penalosa from Bogota who's traveling around Africa, Asia and Latin America explaining how they went about dealing with insecurity and violence and fragility in their cities, and in some ways providing a more compelling vision than those that have been expounded from the North. RAZ: Are there examples of things happening in some of these fragile cities that are kind of being observed by mayors in more prosperous cities, and they're saying, hey, that's kind of cool - like, we should try this out? MUGGAH: Pretty much every day we have a request here in Rio for people to come from as far away as Baltimore and Chicago, but also most recently from Bangkok - basically, groups of mayors and police chiefs and public transport officials who are seeking to extract ideas from the innovations that are taking place even right here in Rio de Janeiro. This is an example, really, of this idea of the North and South becoming blurred. The lines separating, you know, the New Yorks from the Sao Paulos are beginning to disappear. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)MUGGAH: If I have one single message for you it's this - there's nothing inevitable about lethal violence, and we can make our cities safer. We have the opportunity of a lifetime to drop homicidal violence in half within our lifetime. So I have just one question - what are we waiting for? Thank you.

Hundreds of protesters took to the streets of Cologne today and clashed with police, triggered by a series of sexual assaults and robberies that happened on New Year's Eve. (SOUNDBITE OF PROTEST)UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTORS: (Chanting in foreign language). MARTIN: Authorities and eyewitnesses differ on what motivated these attacks. Some believe they were part of an organized pickpocket ring using the attacks as a diversion. Others say the men were drunk. But most of those involved appeared to be North African or Arab. Thirty-one suspects have been taken in for questioning. More than half were asylum-seekers, and all of that has set off a debate over whether the influx of refugees and migrants is changing Germany in unacceptable ways. Some of that debate played out in the anti-immigrant protests today, but there are other opinions. We called writer and feminist activist Anne Wizorek to hear some of those views. She spoke with us from Berlin. And I started by asking her to describe what she knew about the attacks. ANNE WIZOREK: Women have been touched and sometimes their clothes been torn apart, and they have been insulted. And they have been surrounded by this group of men and attacking them. So this is, of course, a very gruesome situation. We just feel powerless and just hope that it's all over basically very soon. MARTIN: So how has Germany's political leadership responded to this? WIZOREK: Well, Haiko Maas, the minister of justice, he was one of the first ones to respond to this and say that this is a kind of violence that will not be tolerated, of course. And now he's also pushed to get the law change that is addressing sexual violence and sexual assault. But I think the most important one was, of course, issued by Angela Merkel, our chancellor. She now wants to see if it's possible to send the people who came here as asylum-seekers and who commit crimes like this back to their home countries, which of course is something that causes another debate on whether or not we should take this incident and change a whole lot and a whole situation for so many more peopleMARTIN: You wrote an article on Vice this week with Stefanie Louhaus saying that the German media have been reporting the violence in terms of a rape culture that was imported in Germany. And - editing a little bit - but you say, in fact, Germany's rape culture is deeply rooted in our collective psyche. What do you mean by that? What are you trying to say here? WIZOREK: Well, the problem of sexism and sexual violence, especially against women has already been there and has nothing to do with any people who come here as refugees or are growing up as people of color in general. So we have to address this problem finally because right now we are only focusing on sexism and sexual assault when it is perpetrated by men of color. And that sets a wrong focus on the problem that we actually have to talk about. MARTIN: To that end though, one of the reasons we called you is that you are the initiator of a hashtag which has gone viral in Germany called #aufschrei, which means outcry. And you started this well before this. What were some of the kinds of issues that you wanted to surface with #aufschrei? WIZOREK: #Aufschrei was an ad hoc campaign, so it wasn't really planned. We were just in the situation on Twitter where one of my friends started sharing her own experience with sexual assault. And I just wanted to have some - something to make us all able to vent about this. So I suggested the hashtag. And then we started tweeting about everything from sexual remarks at the working place, from being stalked, from men following us home, touching us on public transport. People were also sharing their stories about how they have been raped by friends and family. So already under the hashtag, you saw the whole range of sexism and sexual violence happening. MARTIN: Including in big public events. I mean, that's one of the things you wrote about. . . WIZOREK: Yeah. MARTIN: . . . In your piece is that people at Oktoberfest events - women were routinely reporting being groped and having beer poured down their shirts and things of that sort - you know, this kind of similar behavior. Are you saying that you don't think this kind of public street harassment has gotten any attention until it was perpetrated by immigrants or by people perceived to be of color? WIZOREK: Well, let's just say it's very astonishing to see the people who back then when #aufschrei was big in the media and people talked about it that a lot of people also tried to downplay the problems. They were saying, like, well, but we've gotten so far and we have - and gender equity in Germany right now - we have a female chancellor, so what do you want? All that kind of argument was going on. And those people are the ones who are now talking a lot about what has happened in Cologne. So they are using this - these stories and these experiences of the people who have been attacked in Cologne to only push forward with their racist agenda against migrants and refugees in Germany, and I think that's a huge problem. MARTIN: That's writer and feminist activist Anne Wizorek. She's the initiator of the hashtag #aufschrei, which is meant to call attention to the problem of sexual violence and sexual assault in Germany. We reached her in Berlin. Anne, thank you so much for speaking with us. WIZOREK: Thank you. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  Another big story we're watching today is out of Germany. Hundreds of protesters took to the streets of Cologne today and clashed with police, triggered by a series of sexual assaults and robberies that happened on New Year's Eve. (SOUNDBITE OF PROTEST) UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTORS: (Chanting in foreign language). MARTIN: Authorities and eyewitnesses differ on what motivated these attacks. Some believe they were part of an organized pickpocket ring using the attacks as a diversion. Others say the men were drunk. But most of those involved appeared to be North African or Arab. Thirty-one suspects have been taken in for questioning. More than half were asylum-seekers, and all of that has set off a debate over whether the influx of refugees and migrants is changing Germany in unacceptable ways.

It was the news the government had been hoping to give since Joaquin Guzman, known by his nickname El Chapo or Shorty, escaped from the country's maximum security prison through a sophisticated nearly mile-long tunnel. It was an elite group of Marines that stormed a home in the Pacific coast town of Los Mochis early Friday morning. A shootout ensued and five people were killed, but Guzman and another cartel leader managed to escape the home through a sewer tunnel, said Attorney General Arely Gomez Gonzalez at the late-night press conference.

S. Supreme Court today were a remarkable bunch. On one side, there was the Central Bank of Iran. On the other, the victims of Iran-sponsored terrorist attacks going back three decades. The constitutional question was whether Congress, in dealing with both, had infringed on the independence of the federal courts. NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg reports. NINA TOTENBERG, BYLINE: In 2012, President Obama froze nearly $2 billion that the Iranian Central Bank had concealed illegally in an account in New York. Congress then amended an existing anti-terrorism law to strengthen it. The new law specified those funds were to be used to pay off court judgments finding that Iran was responsible for 19 separate terrorist attacks against Americans around the world. The first of those cases was brought on behalf of the families of 241 American servicemen killed in a 1983 Beirut bombing of the Marine barracks. PAUL RIVERS: Thirty-three years ago, I was a young 20-year-old Marine. I was blown up in the building and buried alive for two hours. TOTENBERG: Paul Rivers, now 53, one of the thirty survivors in Beirut, is tired of the decades-long legal battle. RIVERS: This has been an emotional rollercoaster ride for me because my friends are gone. Iran will continue to fund terrorist activities unless we stand up as Americans and say we're tired of it. TOTENBERG: Inside the Supreme Court, the debate was not about whether Iran should pay but whether Congress had unconstitutionally infringed on the judiciary's job by directing the final outcome of particular cases, even listing the docket numbers of those cases in the legislation. Lawyer Jeffrey Lamken, representing the Central Bank of Iran, said it didn't matter whether there was one case or 19. Congress had violated the Constitution by enacting a statute for one set of plaintiffs. Justice Scalia - where do you get the notion that Congress can only act by generality? It acts all the time on individual matters. Lamken insisted, though, that this law is unique, contending that in the rest of the nation's history, Congress had never passed such a statute. Congress crossed the line here, said Lamken, because there's a single defendant - the Central Bank of Iran. Justice Breyer, wryly, a defendant that represents a hundred-million people. Justice Kagan - don't the political branches - the president and Congress - deserve particular deference in matters of foreign affairs, especially when they act together? No, said Lamken. If you uphold this law, he told the justices, the lesson it teaches is, if you want to win your case in court, don't hire a lawyer; hire a lobbyist. Chief Justice Roberts seemed to have the same concern when former Solicitor General Ted Olson, whose own wife was killed in 9/11, took to the lectern. You know, said the chief justice, there are places in the world where the courts function just the way our courts do, except every now and then when there's a case the strongman that runs the country is interested in. And he picks up the phone, and he tells the court, you decide this case this way. I'm not sure I see what the difference is here. Olson contended that the lower courts had found Iran liable for damages for its role in these attacks. The only thing this law deals with, he asserted, is executing those judgments - actually getting the money damages. Chief Justice Roberts - wouldn't your argument mean that Congress can tell us, the Supreme Court, how to rule in a specific case? Justice Kagan picked up that thread when Deputy Solicitor General Edwin Kneedler rose to defend the statute. Since 1801, he told the justices, this court has said that Congress may amend the law and make it applicable to pending cases. But, asked Kagan, could Congress, without actually naming the winner, amend the law in such a way that it's clear who will be the winner? Replied Kneedler - Congress can do that. Chief Justice Roberts - you're saying Congress has to be cute about it; they can't say, in Smith versus Jones, Smith wins, but they can change the law to make sure Smith wins. Justice Breyer - Congress has 4,000 ways of being cute, and I can't quite see this court trying to police those ways. Nina Totenberg, NPR News, Washington.

It's about her grandfather and how he survived the Armenian genocide of 1915. One and a half million Armenians living in modern-day Turkey were killed. Turkey says it was not genocide, but a result of widespread conflict in the region. MacKeen's grandfather left behind journals that became the seeds of her new book \"The Hundred-Year Walk: An Armenian Odyssey. \" I asked her what she knew about her grandfather before she began her research. DAWN ANAHID MACKEEN: My mother told me stories about my grandfather and they were very sad stories of this man who was struggling across a desert and was just fighting for his survival and was so thirsty he had to drink his own urine, which is a very strange thing to hear as a child and it just sounded really gross. And, of course, it was history that I couldn't comprehend until I was in my 30s and I could finally read his firsthand testimony of what happened to him during World War I in the last days of the Ottoman Empire. SHAPIRO: So you read these journals and set off on your own reporting family research trip through Turkey and Syria, retracing his steps. How did that journey change your sense of your grandfather as a person? MACKEEN: I had to see the land that he wrote about. You know, the desert that he was driven across with his caravans, it became a prison to him because it was inhospitable and there weren't many people around. And as I traveled from west to east and the land grew more stark, I just -it was a hard moment to see that, to think of my grandfather outside in the elements. You know, at one point when he was in a makeshift camp in what is now western Syria, a thousand people died from disease in just one month. So this was the kind of thing he was up against, and he really had to summon heroic strength inside to have the courage to continue each day. SHAPIRO: Will you read from a section of the book where you talk about the experience of retracing your grandfather's steps a century later? This is page 153. MACKEEN: Sure. (Reading) Only halfway into my 900-mile journey and I was already weary, and I was a well-fed 36-year-old traveling by car and train, not on foot as Stepan did. I was the one sleeping in beds rated by stars, not outside on the hard ground under the constellations. Just an hour after leaving my air-conditioned hotel room, I was weak and feverish and needed a bathroom, and I was still far from my endpoint, a godforsaken mound of dirt named Markada, just short of the Iraqi border where my grandfather's caravan of thousands met its end. SHAPIRO: On your journey researching this book, you visited Syrian cities such as Raqqa. And a hundred years ago, your grandfather saw it as a haven. Today, the city is controlled by ISIS. What does your experience in the city tell you about this place that is now so - in the news - so fraught, so full of violence and strife? MACKEEN: My experience in Raqqa - and I went there twice, I returned to Syria again in 2009 - was the complete opposite of what you're hearing now from there. It was, in a way, a haven for me just like it was for my grandfather because when I arrived there, I met this Bedouin Sheikh and he took me into his home and gave me his daughter's room and that night, hosted this dinner on the Euphrates and there were Armenians there, there were Bedouins, Arabs. Everyone was around a table enjoying each other's company. There wasn't this religious divide or a hatred that you see. And it just breaks my heart seeing what's happening to Raqqa and also that many people are learning about Raqqa for the first time through this message of hate. SHAPIRO: And the Sheikh took you in out of a sense of hospitality or out of a sense of connection to your grandfather? Describe why he welcomed you in this way. MACKEEN: I think it was out of hospitality. And the people in this region are, you know, had been known for that. And this Sheikh, also, when I met him, I told him about what happened to my grandfather. And the people in this region know what happened to the Armenians. These stories have been handed down in their families of, you know, the mass graves that have been in that area or the Armenians that were taken in by the different clans. And when I told this Bedouin Sheikh in Raqqa that I wanted to find the clan that saved my grandfather's life and it was somewhere in the region, this Sheikh all of a sudden called someone else and this person came over and all of a sudden had two phone lines and started calling all over the region to try to find this clan. And it was an incredible moment for me to watch this happen because it was really a pipe dream. And all of a sudden, they narrowed it down and they said, we found them. Can you go tomorrow? And I said yes, please, please, take me to them. SHAPIRO: Have you kept in touch with any of the people you met in that part of Syria? MACKEEN: You know, sadly, the Bedouin Sheikh died in 2009 when I returned for the second time to Syria to that region. But I do keep in touch with the clan that saved my grandfather's life. And now since the war began, communication has been really difficult. But one of them has left the region and became a refugee just like my grandfather. SHAPIRO: Wow, and gone where? MACKEEN: He made it to Europe and was part of the sea of refugees, you know, going from boat from Turkey to Greece and just what we're seeing in the newspaper. And he's trying to start his life anew there, just like my grandfather did when he came to this country many years ago. SHAPIRO: How does that parallel make you feel across a century? MACKEEN: Yeah, I could never have predicted this. I - first of all, finding them was one of the most wonderful moments of my life. But then when the war broke out and one of them told me - and this was even before the Islamic State took over the territory - you know, just dealing with famine and seeing corpses in the street and really struggling to survive, he said, we now know what your grandfather went through. SHAPIRO: He said that to you? MACKEEN: He did, he did. And it just - I don't even know what to say. It's just - it's heartbreaking because I don't want anyone else to ever have to go through what my grandfather went through. SHAPIRO: I want to bring this back around to your grandfather. We know he survived, but ultimately, what happened to him? MACKEEN: Well, he came to New York with my mother and my aunt in 1930. And he opened a candy store on 133rd and Amsterdam, and he worked around the clock. And then during World War II, he moved to Los Angeles and they kind of steadily started investing. He bought a few apartment buildings and by the time he was in his 80s, he was still climbing onto the roof and fixing the roof. (LAUGHTER)MACKEEN: Yeah - he achieved his dream in the United States and was always so happy to be here. He would play \"God Bless America\" on his accordion. SHAPIRO: (Laughter) If your grandfather were alive today, is there a question you would want to ask him? MACKEEN: I would ask him what he would want for people to learn from his story. And I believe it's about having history not repeat itself. We have to stop having history repeat itself. SHAPIRO: Dawn Anahid MacKeen is the author of \"The Hundred-Year Walk: An Armenian Odyssey. \" Thanks so much for talking with us. MACKEEN: Thank you so much, Ari. It's been a pleasure. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:  Investigative reporter Dawn Anahid MacKeen's latest story is one her mother always wanted her to tell. It's about her grandfather and how he survived the Armenian genocide of 1915. One and a half million Armenians living in modern-day Turkey were killed. Turkey says it was not genocide, but a result of widespread conflict in the region. MacKeen's grandfather left behind journals that became the seeds of her new book \"The Hundred-Year Walk: An Armenian Odyssey. \" I asked her what she knew about her grandfather before she began her research. DAWN ANAHID MACKEEN: My mother told me stories about my grandfather and they were very sad stories of this man who was struggling across a desert and was just fighting for his survival and was so thirsty he had to drink his own urine, which is a very strange thing to hear as a child and it just sounded really gross. And, of course, it was history that I couldn't comprehend until I was in my 30s and I could finally read his firsthand testimony of what happened to him during World War I in the last days of the Ottoman Empire. SHAPIRO: So you read these journals and set off on your own reporting family research trip through Turkey and Syria, retracing his steps. How did that journey change your sense of your grandfather as a person? MACKEEN: I had to see the land that he wrote about. You know, the desert that he was driven across with his caravans, it became a prison to him because it was inhospitable and there weren't many people around. And as I traveled from west to east and the land grew more stark, I just -it was a hard moment to see that, to think of my grandfather outside in the elements. You know, at one point when he was in a makeshift camp in what is now western Syria, a thousand people died from disease in just one month. So this was the kind of thing he was up against, and he really had to summon heroic strength inside to have the courage to continue each day. SHAPIRO: Will you read from a section of the book where you talk about the experience of retracing your grandfather's steps a century later? This is page 153. MACKEEN: Sure. (Reading) Only halfway into my 900-mile journey and I was already weary, and I was a well-fed 36-year-old traveling by car and train, not on foot as Stepan did. I was the one sleeping in beds rated by stars, not outside on the hard ground under the constellations. Just an hour after leaving my air-conditioned hotel room, I was weak and feverish and needed a bathroom, and I was still far from my endpoint, a godforsaken mound of dirt named Markada, just short of the Iraqi border where my grandfather's caravan of thousands met its end. SHAPIRO: On your journey researching this book, you visited Syrian cities such as Raqqa. And a hundred years ago, your grandfather saw it as a haven. Today, the city is controlled by ISIS. What does your experience in the city tell you about this place that is now so - in the news - so fraught, so full of violence and strife? MACKEEN: My experience in Raqqa - and I went there twice, I returned to Syria again in 2009 - was the complete opposite of what you're hearing now from there. It was, in a way, a haven for me just like it was for my grandfather because when I arrived there, I met this Bedouin Sheikh and he took me into his home and gave me his daughter's room and that night, hosted this dinner on the Euphrates and there were Armenians there, there were Bedouins, Arabs. Everyone was around a table enjoying each other's company. There wasn't this religious divide or a hatred that you see. And it just breaks my heart seeing what's happening to Raqqa and also that many people are learning about Raqqa for the first time through this message of hate. SHAPIRO: And the Sheikh took you in out of a sense of hospitality or out of a sense of connection to your grandfather? Describe why he welcomed you in this way. MACKEEN: I think it was out of hospitality. And the people in this region are, you know, had been known for that. And this Sheikh, also, when I met him, I told him about what happened to my grandfather. And the people in this region know what happened to the Armenians. These stories have been handed down in their families of, you know, the mass graves that have been in that area or the Armenians that were taken in by the different clans. And when I told this Bedouin Sheikh in Raqqa that I wanted to find the clan that saved my grandfather's life and it was somewhere in the region, this Sheikh all of a sudden called someone else and this person came over and all of a sudden had two phone lines and started calling all over the region to try to find this clan. And it was an incredible moment for me to watch this happen because it was really a pipe dream. And all of a sudden, they narrowed it down and they said, we found them. Can you go tomorrow? And I said yes, please, please, take me to them. SHAPIRO: Have you kept in touch with any of the people you met in that part of Syria? MACKEEN: You know, sadly, the Bedouin Sheikh died in 2009 when I returned for the second time to Syria to that region. But I do keep in touch with the clan that saved my grandfather's life. And now since the war began, communication has been really difficult. But one of them has left the region and became a refugee just like my grandfather. SHAPIRO: Wow, and gone where? MACKEEN: He made it to Europe and was part of the sea of refugees, you know, going from boat from Turkey to Greece and just what we're seeing in the newspaper. And he's trying to start his life anew there, just like my grandfather did when he came to this country many years ago. SHAPIRO: How does that parallel make you feel across a century? MACKEEN: Yeah, I could never have predicted this. I - first of all, finding them was one of the most wonderful moments of my life. But then when the war broke out and one of them told me - and this was even before the Islamic State took over the territory - you know, just dealing with famine and seeing corpses in the street and really struggling to survive, he said, we now know what your grandfather went through. SHAPIRO: He said that to you? MACKEEN: He did, he did. And it just - I don't even know what to say. It's just - it's heartbreaking because I don't want anyone else to ever have to go through what my grandfather went through. SHAPIRO: I want to bring this back around to your grandfather. We know he survived, but ultimately, what happened to him? MACKEEN: Well, he came to New York with my mother and my aunt in 1930. And he opened a candy store on 133rd and Amsterdam, and he worked around the clock. And then during World War II, he moved to Los Angeles and they kind of steadily started investing.

He has been held in Iran since 2012, sentenced to eight years in prison for Christian proselytizing. Saeed Abedeni is 35 years old. He's from Boise, Idaho, and he is a convert from Islam to Christianity. We reached his wife Naghmeh in Idaho today. Mrs. Abedini, thank you so much for speaking with us. NAGHMEH ABEDINI: Thank you for having me. MARTIN: It must have been - it must continue to be such an emotional day. I can't even imagine. But can you just sort of describe what's going through your mind right now? ABEDINI: It's a good emotional, and the last three and a half years have been very hard emotional. And it's a good - it's amazing news to get early in the morning, and to be able to finally have an answer to my kids' question of when it is daddy coming home? And I was able to finally tell them he's coming home soon. MARTIN: May I ask how you learned that he was going to be released? ABEDINI: Interesting enough, through Iranian media has said that the Americans were released. And after it broke out on the Iranian media, I got a call from State Department saying that it was true, that Saeed and the other Americans were at the Swiss embassy and that they were being transported to the airport. As far as I know, since in the last hour, they're still on  Iranian soil, and they're trying to leave the airport. There seems to be something holding them back, but we're hoping he'll be out of Iranian territory within the next few hours. MARTIN: You have not yet been able to speak with him? ABEDINI: No. Once - once he is out of Iran, he will be flown into Switzerland by a Swiss airplane. And there will be a quick change of planes there, and he will be brought to Germany. And once he's there, there's evaluations and certain things that he will be going through with our government. And that is when I will get a phone call, so it could be much later tonight when I first get to talk to him. MARTIN: You wrote a piece for The Post back in October, and it was a fairly - I don't want to say despairing piece, but it seemed as though you were giving up hope at that time. Is that true? Did you - were you starting to feel that there was not going to be a positive resolution here? ABEDINI: Not giving up hope, but I was - I had - I came to peace with - that this could be a few more years. And when I came to peace with that and just let go and focused on my kids and my own healing is when he's released. So the least-expected time I could've ever imagined during my travels or - I don't know, when I was advocating all the time - is when it would've happened. MARTIN: Well, I was going to ask you about that because you have become, on your husband's behalf, one of the kind of higher-profile advocates around the whole question of religious freedom. You did seem to withdraw from public advocacy for a period of time. And I did want to ask why was that? Was it because of the toll of the traveling? ABEDINI: It was. That was a big part of it. There was also a lot of personal issues, although I am very proud of my husband for having stood his faith regardless of the pressures in the last three years. The truth is there's some very serious issues that will need to be dealt with once he's home and our family will need to sure the last three years. The truth is there are some very serious issues that will need to be dealt with once he's home, and our family will need to, you know, step into a road of healing and reconciliation. And Saeed's - I'm a different person, he's a different person, and I don't know where he's at physically, mentally, what has happened in the last three years and where he's at as a person. And just our family will have to go through a lot of transition. MARTIN: How old are the kids now, if you don't mind my asking? ABEDINI: Rebecca is - Rebecca is 9 and Jacob is 7. MARTIN: So it's been - that's a long time in kids' lives. How did they the react to be separated from a parent? How did they react when you told them that he was - had been released or was going to be released? ABEDINI: You know, it's half their lifetime. And for them, it seemed like - you know, it seemed like a long time. They were just jumping up and down, rejoicing. And they're making a welcome home sign right now as we speak. MARTIN: How are you doing? ABEDINI: It's been a busy day, but I'm good. You know, it's a good surprise. The battle is over and now we can focus on the next journey as a family and healing and transition. And at least that first huge hurdle's over. And God is bigger than the next hurdle. And we will move forward as a family. MARTIN: You've kind of suggested to us that your period as a public person is coming to an end. Is there something there - before you kind of withdrawal into your private life - is there something you would wish for us to know about what it's like to go through something like this that perhaps we might not know? ABEDINI: The biggest thing I've learned is all of us go through turmoil either caused by circumstances or people. And I've learned to be happy and at peace no matter the circumstance and find that strength in God. And I know that Saeed has grown a lot, too, in his faith. And so it will be a period of transition. MARTIN: Well, our very best to you, and thank you so much for speaking with us and thank you for taking the time on this very special and important day in your life and our very best wishes to you and to your family. ABEDINI: Thank you so much. I appreciate your - your call. MARTIN: That was Naghmeh Abedini. She learned today that her husband Saeed was one of the American prisoners released from Iran, and we were able to reach her today in Boise, Idaho.

Joaquin Guzman, the world's most wanted drug lord, humiliated the government when he escaped from a Mexican prison last summer through an elaborate mile-long tunnel. When El Chapo was recaptured last weekend, President Enrique Pena Nieto tweeted, mission accomplished. But what are Mexican citizens saying about his arrest and the ongoing drug violence there? Genaro Lozano is a columnist in Mexico City, and he teaches politics at the Universidad Iberoamericana. Thanks very much for being with us. GENARO LOZANO: Thank you, Scott. It's a pleasure to be with you and good morning to everyone. SIMON: You've been on social media sites. What are a lot of Mexicans saying about this? LOZANO: People here are discussing over lunches, over tacos and burritos, about the romance between El Chapo and Kate del Castillo, this Mexican actress that was the link between El Chapo and Sean Penn, and also if President Enrique Pena Nieto is going to be able to change the dynamic of his low popularity in the following weeks. SIMON: So very little feeling that they'll have any impact on drug trafficking and violence? LOZANO: Yeah, but people are very skeptical about it. I mean, because everybody knows that the fact that El Chapo has been recaptured, it doesn't really change anything in the formula. People are still dying on the streets because of this war on drugs that President Calderon started in 2006. Mayors are being killed. Candidates running for office are also being kidnapped or disappearing. Journalists are living in the country that - it's one of the most dangerous in the world for journalists. And that's another thing that people are discussing, especially the journalists in Mexico know that the quality of Sean Penn's chronicle and interview and the reasons and all the privileges that he had for being able to unite with El Chapo, privileges that journalists in Mexico don't have. SIMON: Yeah. Is the Rolling Stone article itself getting much play, much attention? LOZANO: Yeah, the article's getting a lot of attention. But also people started discussing the poor quality of it. And it became at least a conversation in social media about how Sean Penn was actually saying more about himself and his ego rather than telling us a different perspective or a different point of view from El Chapo. SIMON: Is Joaquin Guzman, El Chapo, any less of a folk hero to some Mexicans now that he's been recaptured? LOZANO: That was also a discussion, if Sean Penn's piece was portraying him as a hero. And I don't think that in Mexico we consider El Chapo a hero, not as Pablo Escobar was considered a hero in Colombia back in the '80s. People know that El Chapo is not a hero. People know that he's a criminal, that he has committed murders, that he was one of the most wanted men in the world. So I don't think that people consider him a hero. He's just a character that people are wondering about and are very curious about. SIMON: Has the Mexican government tried to spin this story, as we might say? LOZANO: Yeah, the Mexican government, I think that has been very intelligent in sharing some information with some newspapers, with some TVs, giving a little bit, giving cookies to different media to portray different stories about El Chapo. And I think that what they're trying to do is to actually stop the Mexican people believing that El Chapo is a hero. And they're attacking him where it hurts most to a Mexican man - machismo. So they're actually portraying a drug lord who wasn't able to perform sexually. So they're giving all these details now about El Chapo having surgery to perform better as a lover.

S. and Iran that led to this weekend's prisoner swap. Several of the Americans are in Germany tonight after flying out of Tehran. President Obama announced that his administration has settled hundreds of millions of dollars in claims with Iran. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BARACK OBAMA: The United States has never been afraid to pursue diplomacy with our adversaries. And as president, I decided that a strong, confident America could advance our national security by engaging directly with the Iranian government. MARTIN: He's also trying to strike a balance. The president has imposed new sanctions to punish Iran for continued ballistic missile tests in violation of U. N. Security Council resolutions. NPR's Michele Kelemen is back with us to talk about all this. First of all, Michele, what is the latest on the Americans who were freed? Why did it take so long for them to leave? There seems to have been some hours lag between the time that we heard about the swap and when they actually left the country. MICHELE KELEMEN, BYLINE: That's right. We're told that it took some time to make sure that the wife and the mother of Washington Post journalist Jason Rezaian were on board and able to leave Iran. His wife had spent some time in prison herself and had some legal issues hanging over her. So they're now all in Germany. The family of former Marine Amir Hekmati says they're grateful that Amir is going to be able to return home soon to his father, who's quite ill. Pastor Saeed Abedini was also on that plane, according to his wife. One Iranian-American apparently stayed behind - that's a case we know very little about - while a fifth prisoner, Matt Trevithick, left yesterday. MARTIN: Can you tell us a little bit more about the process? Are U. S. officials telling us any of the - sort of the backstory on this? KELEMEN: Well, you know, this all started in negotiations that started about 14 months ago. And it came out of the nuclear talks, but they were kept on a very different tract and kept secret. They were led by a State Department official named Brett McGurk. He was meeting with Iranians in secret in Switzerland. And by the way, some of these Americans were picked up while these talks were taking place. The Iranians were asking for many Iranian nationals to be released from prison here. And U. S. officials are telling us today that they managed to whittle down that list to a small group of nonviolent offenders. These were people who were in jail or facing charges here mainly for sanctions busting. MARTIN: Can I just briefly ask you about another name that many Americans may have heard, which is Robert Levinson? He's a former FBI agent, as I understand it, who has been - not been heard from for a very long time. Do we know anything about him? KELEMEN: The only thing U. S. officials say is that his case was discussed in these negotiations, that the Iranians have agreed to work closely with the U. S. to help locate him. He's been missing since 2007, and it's never been clear who's been holding him and where. MARTIN: Before we let you go, Michele, the U. S. announced today that it is adding more sanctions on Iran at the same time as the announcement of the big claims settlement between the U. S. between the U. S. and Iran, a big financial settlement. Can you just briefly try to tie all those things together? KELEMEN: (Laughter) Well, the administration was always promising that even as it was lifting these nuclear-related sanctions it was going to keep up the pressure on Iran for other bad behavior. So these targeted sanctions that were announced today were in response to Iranian ballistic missile tests. They were targeted against three companies and eight individuals. And the U. S. held off on this announcement until they got the American prisoners out. On the settlement issue, Iran's going to receive $400 million plus $1. 3 billion in interest. U. S. officials say this is money that Iran paid for for U. S. military equipment before the revolution, and clearing these sorts of claims is in U. S. interests. MARTIN: That's NPR's diplomatic correspondent Michele Kelemen. Thanks, Michele. KELEMEN: Thank you. MARTIN: I'd like to mention we will be speaking with Congressman Dan Kildee later this hour. The Congressman has been fighting for the release of the longest-held of the prisoners who were just released. That's former U. S. Marine Amir Hekmati. And we will hear from him in a minute. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  We're going to start the program today trying to learn more about the diplomacy between the U. S. and Iran that led to this weekend's prisoner swap. Several of the Americans are in Germany tonight after flying out of Tehran. President Obama announced that his administration has settled hundreds of millions of dollars in claims with Iran. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BARACK OBAMA: The United States has never been afraid to pursue diplomacy with our adversaries. And as president, I decided that a strong, confident America could advance our national security by engaging directly with the Iranian government. MARTIN: He's also trying to strike a balance. The president has imposed new sanctions to punish Iran for continued ballistic missile tests in violation of U. N. Security Council resolutions. NPR's Michele Kelemen is back with us to talk about all this. First of all, Michele, what is the latest on the Americans who were freed? Why did it take so long for them to leave? There seems to have been some hours lag between the time that we heard about the swap and when they actually left the country. MICHELE KELEMEN, BYLINE: That's right. We're told that it took some time to make sure that the wife and the mother of Washington Post journalist Jason Rezaian were on board and able to leave Iran. His wife had spent some time in prison herself and had some legal issues hanging over her. So they're now all in Germany. The family of former Marine Amir Hekmati says they're grateful that Amir is going to be able to return home soon to his father, who's quite ill. Pastor Saeed Abedini was also on that plane, according to his wife. One Iranian-American apparently stayed behind - that's a case we know very little about - while a fifth prisoner, Matt Trevithick, left yesterday. MARTIN: Can you tell us a little bit more about the process? Are U. S. officials telling us any of the - sort of the backstory on this? KELEMEN: Well, you know, this all started in negotiations that started about 14 months ago. And it came out of the nuclear talks, but they were kept on a very different tract and kept secret.

With a declaration late Saturday, Iran reached implementation day, when the nuclear deal was finally completed. It means a raft of punishing economic sanctions are being lifted. The joy in Tehran is matched by the concern being felt by some of Iran's neighbors and critics of the nuclear deal in the U. S. To explain what this means for Iran and the region, NPR's Peter Kenyon joins us from Istanbul. Peter, thanks for being with us. PETER KENYON, BYLINE: Hi, Rachel. MARTIN: Peter, you have been covering the complicated negotiations around Iran's nuclear program for years. This is a significant moment - how significant? KENYON: Well, you know, I don't think people really recognized it as it was being put together piece by piece over time. But while this is a landmark nuclear deal, it was also an unprecedented sanctions regime. When you think about it, it's amazing that the U. S. , Europe, Russia and China, with all their differences, would come together and stay together for years on a sanctions regime like this. A little bit of it now is coming off. But it's some really important pieces, and the changes are going to be dramatic. President Rouhani was just speaking. And he called it a turning point for the country and its relations with the rest of the world. MARTIN: OK, boil it down for us. What are the most important changes that will take place? KENYON: Well, politically for Iran, they've craved the end of U. N. Security Council sanctions for many years. I mean, that's the world sanctioning Iran, not just its enemies. But economically, it's the banking sanctions. A lot of transactions blocked, and all sectors of the economy will now be flowing again. Doing business will be so much easier. Tens of billions of dollars or more in unfrozen assets will be a big short-term - will be a big short-term help as well. The Iranian oil tankers are now heading towards Europe and Asian markets again. The price, of course, is so low; it's not clear how much of a help that will be. But there are so many sectors, economically, where investment is needed, especially in oil and gas. And I guess we should say, it's also a good thing for lovers of caviar and saffron and pistachios. MARTIN: (Laughter) Indeed. So what about American sanctions, though? Because there were some discrete U. S. actions against Iran. KENYON: That's right. It's a little trickier though. I mean, these are called secondary sanctions. They apply to foreign companies who want to do business both with the U. S. and Iran. They will now be able to do that without losing access to their U. S. markets. But the primary sanctions against U. S. companies those are still in place. Now, there may be some in-between areas if you have a foreign subsidiary, and the U. S. Treasury Department has let in - has issued a raft of guidelines about that. So the lawyers will be busy studying those. MARTIN: Here in the U. S. , this is being seen by some in the foreign policy community as a big win for President Obama. But there's been a whole lot of criticism from many on the right, especially Republican presidential candidates who say, you know, this is going to unlock billions of dollars of frozen assets that will just embolden Iran in a very unstable region. How is it being played out in Iran? How is the government there framing this? KENYON: Well, it's a good question. It is a big win, and yet. I mean, Iranian politics are so factional and so complex, hard to read. Hardliners have been very active lately. And one reason, we should say, that President Rouhani's government has been racing to get to this point - beating U. S. estimates by months - is that elections are coming up next month. And both Parliament and also a group of experts are going to have a hand in picking the next supreme leader. So in theory, this lifting sanctions now should be a big boost for Rouhani and moderates who helped elect him. But I asked analyst Ali Vaez at the International Crisis Group about that. And he says it's actually a little too late. He probably won't get a big boost. So we're just going to have to see what the impact is there. MARTIN: NPR's Peter Kenyon in Istanbul.

S. officials are looking for three Americans who have disappeared in Baghdad. Years ago, during the height of the U. S. presence in Iraq, there were many cases of Americans being kidnapped by militias, but that hasn't happened in years. NPR's Alice Fordham joins us now from Baghdad. Hi, Alice. ALICE FORDHAM, BYLINE: Hi, Ari. SHAPIRO: What can you tell us about how these three people went missing? FORDHAM: Well, what we know for sure is limited, Ari, but I can tell you a U. S. official has confirmed to NPR that the three missing Americans were subcontracted by a group called General Dynamics, which is contracted by the defense department here in Baghdad. Now the company itself didn't respond to requests for comment, and all the U. S. embassy will say here is that they are investigating the disappearance of several individuals, they can't say more because of privacy rules. And another thing we know for sure is that in the Baghdad suburb of Dora, which is where they're believed to have disappeared, there's a huge manhunt underway. Streets closed, surveillance aircraft, houses being raided by Iraqi security forces. Now beyond that, we're filling in the gaps with reports from Iraqi and from other security sources who've spoken to NPR on condition of anonymity. And these aren't things we've been able to confirm independently, but I'm hearing from multiple sources that there were two Iraqi-Americans and an Egyptian-American - it may have been two men and one woman - and that they went into a social event in that neighborhood, Dora - which is a rough area, actually - on Friday afternoon. That social event was then raided by an armed group in uniforms, likely a militia, which detained the three of them. Now that's the prevailing theory. That's what we're hearing from people, including the Iraqi Interior Ministry, although it's also been suggested that they were driving along a highway when they were taken. SHAPIRO: Do you have any idea who this armed group in uniforms, who this militia might have been? FORDHAM: Well, it seems likely that they were one of a lot of Shiite Muslim militias which now operate in Baghdad. Some of these groups are actually allied with the government and are very active in the fight against ISIS. But there's a lot more, usually smaller, groups who style themselves sometimes as moral enforcers, so they do things like raid brothels or parties. There's also just a lot of criminal activity, Ari. There's gangs kidnapping for money. The Iraqi economy has suffered badly from low oil prices, among other things, and we're seeing more and more reports of crime - kidnapping, as well as bank robberies and that kind of thing. SHAPIRO: Do you get the sense that this was a planned operation or a crime of opportunity? I mean, are Americans being targeted in Baghdad again? FORDHAM: Well, again, it's hard to say. I can tell you the context of this is that a lot of the Shiite militias have close ties with Iran, so some analysts were wondering whether this was could have been connected with an Iranian wish for bargaining chips, but that's speculation. We haven't heard anything from the captors, so there's absolutely no evidence to support that theory currently. Although obviously, it doesn't say anything good about security in Baghdad. The prime minister's economic advisor was just lamenting to me this morning that he would love Americans to come and invest in Iraq, and this kind of incident makes that less and less likely. SHAPIRO: Generally speaking, in the parts of Iraq that are not held by ISIS, what is security like these days? FORDHAM: You know, it's often not good because so much of the police and the army are deployed to fight ISIS elsewhere. Violence flared up in the southern city of Basra this week, and in the last year we've seen kidnappings of a group of Turkish construction workers and a group of Qatari nationals who were on a hunting trip in the southern part of Iraq.

N. documents the devastating effect of the war in Iraq on civilians there. Around 20,000 people have been killed since Islamic State militants started seizing control of Iraqi towns two years ago. NPR's Alice Fordham joins us from Baghdad with details. Hi, Alice. ALICE FORDHAM, BYLINE: Hi there. SHAPIRO: How are these civilians dying? FORDHAM: Well, if you look over the timeframe of this report, the big spike in violence was in August 2014, which, if you remember, is when ISIS did their big land grab. They took the city of Mosul and a bunch of other areas. And what happened then was they killed a lot of people - civilians, people from the security forces, religious minorities, Shiite Muslims, people they consider apostates. And what's happened since then is that the people who are most likely to be killed by ISIS, those people have fled in a huge wave of displacement or, honestly, they've been killed. The report also has chilling details of mass graves. So in the last year or so, the pattern has changed, and most of the recorded civilian deaths are in Baghdad, and they're from ISIS bombings. The report also has a lot of details of deaths and rights abuses by other armed groups in Iraq. It's not just ISIS. There's security forces accidentally hitting civilian areas - airstrikes. It's not really made clear if they're Iraqi airstrikes, although they could be strikes by the U. S. -led coalition hitting civilians, and government-allied militias, too, abducting people who aren't heard of again, besides things like destroying property. SHAPIRO: Does the report really say much about what's going on inside ISIS-held areas? FORDHAM: Yeah. It's - you know, it's well-known that the group imposes harsh laws and violent punishments. But there's a lot more detail in the report. One thing it has that I didn't know before is that the U. N. has verified that in June last year somewhere between 800 and 900 children were abducted in the city of Mosul. Those aged between 5 and 10 were placed in a religious education camp. Those aged between 10 and 15 are sent for military training. The group goes around universities and schools telling people that they will have to join the group as fighters when they pass their current exams. There's a report that the U. N. says it's been able to verify 18 males under the age of 18 being executed for running away from the fighting. All the violence by different groups outlined in the report can - I think it can remind us that ISIS is just one of many violent actors in Iraq. But there's also reminders that what's different about them is not just the scale of the killing but the way that they do it. It's always for public consumption. There's people accused of homosexuality being thrown from buildings. There's an instance where a man was executed and then displayed from a bridge. And then there are details of people from the Yazidi religious minority who are still enslaved. SHAPIRO: Just horrible details - what else does the report say about Yazidis who we know ISIS has specifically targeted? FORDHAM: Well, the report suggests there are about 3,500 Yazidis who are still held by ISIS. Some are women and some are men. The women - it's thought - are likely to be sex slaves. Many of them are likely to be in Syria or, in fact, not in Iraq. The number might have gone down a bit since the time of the report, which ends at the end of October. A lot of people in northern Iraq, which is the Yazidi heartland, told me they're essentially buying back their relatives. SHAPIRO: The U. N. 's high commissioner called the casualty numbers obscene. Does the U. N. make recommendations in this report? FORDHAM: Yeah. The report urges things like all parties observing international humanitarian law and investigating abuses. In the long term, I think the U. N. , like lots of other players, has called for political reconciliation in Iraq, in addition to military success against ISIS. In the short term, speaking to the humanitarian branches of the organization, I know they're desperately worried about the millions of displaced people here and who's going to look after them. The U.

Thank you, Alice. FORDHAM: Thanks for having me. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:   A new report from the U. N. documents the devastating effect of the war in Iraq on civilians there. Around 20,000 people have been killed since Islamic State militants started seizing control of Iraqi towns two years ago. NPR's Alice Fordham joins us from Baghdad with details. Hi, Alice. ALICE FORDHAM, BYLINE: Hi there. SHAPIRO: How are these civilians dying? FORDHAM: Well, if you look over the timeframe of this report, the big spike in violence was in August 2014, which, if you remember, is when ISIS did their big land grab. They took the city of Mosul and a bunch of other areas. And what happened then was they killed a lot of people - civilians, people from the security forces, religious minorities, Shiite Muslims, people they consider apostates. And what's happened since then is that the people who are most likely to be killed by ISIS, those people have fled in a huge wave of displacement or, honestly, they've been killed. The report also has chilling details of mass graves. So in the last year or so, the pattern has changed, and most of the recorded civilian deaths are in Baghdad, and they're from ISIS bombings. The report also has a lot of details of deaths and rights abuses by other armed groups in Iraq. It's not just ISIS. There's security forces accidentally hitting civilian areas - airstrikes. It's not really made clear if they're Iraqi airstrikes, although they could be strikes by the U. S. -led coalition hitting civilians, and government-allied militias, too, abducting people who aren't heard of again, besides things like destroying property. SHAPIRO: Does the report really say much about what's going on inside ISIS-held areas? FORDHAM: Yeah. It's - you know, it's well-known that the group imposes harsh laws and violent punishments. But there's a lot more detail in the report. One thing it has that I didn't know before is that the U. N. has verified that in June last year somewhere between 800 and 900 children were abducted in the city of Mosul. Those aged between 5 and 10 were placed in a religious education camp. Those aged between 10 and 15 are sent for military training. The group goes around universities and schools telling people that they will have to join the group as fighters when they pass their current exams. There's a report that the U. N. says it's been able to verify 18 males under the age of 18 being executed for running away from the fighting. All the violence by different groups outlined in the report can - I think it can remind us that ISIS is just one of many violent actors in Iraq. But there's also reminders that what's different about them is not just the scale of the killing but the way that they do it. It's always for public consumption. There's people accused of homosexuality being thrown from buildings. There's an instance where a man was executed and then displayed from a bridge. And then there are details of people from the Yazidi religious minority who are still enslaved. SHAPIRO: Just horrible details - what else does the report say about Yazidis who we know ISIS has specifically targeted? FORDHAM: Well, the report suggests there are about 3,500 Yazidis who are still held by ISIS. Some are women and some are men. The women - it's thought - are likely to be sex slaves. Many of them are likely to be in Syria or, in fact, not in Iraq. The number might have gone down a bit since the time of the report, which ends at the end of October. A lot of people in northern Iraq, which is the Yazidi heartland, told me they're essentially buying back their relatives. SHAPIRO: The U. N. 's high commissioner called the casualty numbers obscene. Does the U. N. make recommendations in this report? FORDHAM: Yeah. The report urges things like all parties observing international humanitarian law and investigating abuses. In the long term, I think the U. N. , like lots of other players, has called for political reconciliation in Iraq, in addition to military success against ISIS. In the short term, speaking to the humanitarian branches of the organization, I know they're desperately worried about the millions of displaced people here and who's going to look after them. The U. N. says that it has funding shortfalls, and Iraq is suffering from low oil prices, and it's going to struggle to feed and shelter people. SHAPIRO: That's NPR's Alice Fordham in Baghdad.

He's a refugee who just settled with his family in Canada. MAANVI SINGH, BYLINE: They're so bundled up that they can barely move and they're sliding down this hill giggling all the way down.

She also wrote about the first time she saw snow. It was after her family moved from India to the U. S. and they visited Lake Tahoe in California. SINGH: I think was 8 or 9 years old. I remember getting out of this, like, minivan and stepping out into snow, and I had no idea what it would feel like - whether it would feel like the shaved ice in a snow cone or if it would feel kind of heavy, or would it be super light? And I remember, like, touching it without gloves at first, and I was, like, oh, my gosh, this is way colder than I have ever imagined. And it's biting. It kind of hits your face and it hurts. My cousins, who are younger than me, wanted to build, like, a snowman or something, and at that point, I was like, no, I'm going back in the car and I'm never coming out. How do people live in this weather? Like, how is this even a thing? (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)SHAPIRO: We asked our followers on social media for their stories of first snow. Stephen Charles from Greensboro, N. C. , sent us this memory. STEPHEN CHARLES: My first encounter with snow was leaving St. Thomas, Virgin Islands, and joining the military and having to report to Fort Dix, N. J. It was my first time going from 80s and 90s to that winter. It was 19 degrees. Not having the right clothes and having to learn how to march in formation on snow and ice.

So while everyone else is pretty bummed out about this weekend, I am really looking forward to it.

This past weekend, one zoo did just that with a lion, and Sidsel Overgaard paid a visit. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: (Foreign language spoken). SIDSEL OVERGAARD, BYLINE: It's a cold day, and the brightly-colored snow suits worn by Danish children makes it easy to pick them out of the crowd here at the Odense Zoo. There are dozens, all ages, many of them standing as close as possible to the lion laid out on the table. LIV: (Foreign language spoken). OVERGAARD: Six-year-old Liv and her grandmother Dorit Boshau are discussing whether they can see the beginnings of a mane. LIV: (Foreign language spoken).

UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: (Foreign language spoken). OVERGAARD: After talking for a while about the lion's coat and claws, the zoo's educator, a biology student from the local university, begins to cut. At this point, a handful of children walk out. But for the most part, the audience stays put, covering their noses as the smell becomes overwhelming but apparently riveted by what they're seeing. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: (Foreign language spoken). OVERGAARD: The student points out the many similarities between the lion's anatomy and our own.

JAN PEDERSEN: It's a natural part of living. We're eating meat almost every day. I know we don't eat lion, but to see how animals look inside, that's being a part of growing up and getting wiser. OVERGAARD: Given the international media storm that followed the killing and dissection of a giraffe at the Copenhagen Zoo two years ago, Danes are well aware that the rest of the world does not always share this perspective. Critics argue that these displays are desensitizing at best and traumatizing at worst. But this is the culture of Denmark, says Jessica Alexander, American co-author of \"The Danish Way Of Parenting. \"JESSICA ALEXANDER: Danes are very, very honest with their children about life. OVERGAARD: She says while some may see a lion dissection as shocking, most Danes see it as an educational opportunity. ALEXANDER: Maybe kids are going to come out of this and become animal activists and vegans. We don't know what kind of effect it's going to have on them, but they're going to be free to make up their own mind about it. OVERGAARD: Alexander says she trusts Danish parents to know whether their children can handle events like this. Another spectator, Jens Jessen, says he had a chat with his nine-year-old son Rasmus before they came to the zoo today.

TOM MORRIS: OK, so we're standing now on the stage of the Bristol Old Vic. And with us is some 18th century machinery. There's a wind machine, which basically - it's like a wooden wheel and a handle on the side of it. And if you turn it, it sounds like - it sounds like this.

And you revolve the wheel and it makes that noise. MARTIN: Now, those are pretty cool. But the show-stopper is way up in the rafters. MORRIS: So if we walk up these steps. . . MARTIN: It's a wooden gutter system that runs back and forth some 25 yards across the building. It's something they call the Thunder Run.

It looks like an ancient barn that you'd store wheat or something. We're now really close to this piece of machinery itself. It's 1776 pitch pine. It sounds like this if you hit it.

Here's one. Iran had billions of dollars' worth of funds that were parked in banks, unable to be accessed. Now those once-frozen assets are flowing again.

But the Iran central bank governor said recently that they moved 32 billion, so it's not clear what's going on with the rest of the money. Have they not had access to it yet? It's still waiting to get unwound as the plumbing of the international financial system gets put back together after Iran's been unfrozen. Or maybe more of it is tied up than we thought in some of these terrible assets and nonperforming loans. MARTIN: Let's talk about the nature of this money. Where did it come from in the first place? Is this oil revenue? What generated it? ROSENBERG: So mostly we're talking about money that's frozen that was associated with people who were blacklisted on the U. S. sanctions list. People and companies that were on that list, their assets were frozen. And now, after about 400 entities have been taken off that list last Saturday, on implementation day, their assets are now free to go, free to move around. MARTIN: This was money, though, that was linked to specific individuals. So does it go back to them, or does it go to the Iranian government? ROSENBERG: Also linked to the Central Bank of Iran. And in a highly state-controlled economy, the government has access to or control over plenty of it. MARTIN: Can you give us an economic picture of Iran right now? The country had been in severe recession, in part because of these crippling economic sanctions related to the nuclear program. What are the most acute economic needs there? ROSENBERG: Iran's economy is in pretty rough shape. Import's falling. Inflation is a concern. Unemployment is a concern. That's a pretty poor outlook for a country that's just been brought in from the cold. MARTIN: Do we have a sense of, then, where this money is going to be used? I mean, there's been a lot of criticism from people on Capitol Hill who have pointed at this deal and said it's a bad idea, in part because all this money is now going to flow back into the Iranian government, and we can't be sure how they're going to use it. And critics have said - what's to prevent the government from using this money to build up its military and further destabilize the region, instead of using it domestically for - to create jobs programs, to build up infrastructure? ROSENBERG: Right. And they have a track record of doing so. It's a state sponsor of terror. We're clear about their financing for Hezbollah, their financing for the Houthis, their active involvement in destabilizing the region. And it doesn't necessarily take a lot of money to fund low-level conflict that can be a major problem in the region. It's not possible to ensure that Iran won't spend a penny on that kind of destabilizing, concerning activity, although what's abundantly clear is that they have lots of needs for infrastructure investment, for access to this liquidity to help them manage their currency as well as, you know, basic jobs development, subsidy rollbacks. There's more needs than that 55 billion or 100 billion, if you're so inclined to think that way, can help support. MARTIN: Elizabeth Rosenberg of the Center for New American Security, thanks so much. ROSENBERG: Thanks very much. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:  There are a lot of very big consequences to the implementation of the Iran nuclear deal. Here's one. Iran had billions of dollars' worth of funds that were parked in banks, unable to be accessed. Now those once-frozen assets are flowing again. Iran's economy had been crippled by economic sanctions related to its nuclear program, so those now-unfrozen assets are going to be most welcome. To better understand where this money goes now, we reached Elizabeth Rosenberg. She's a senior fellow at the Center for New American Security and a former senior adviser at the U. S. Department of Treasury. Thanks so much for being with us. ELIZABETH ROSENBERG: Glad to be with you. MARTIN: How much money are we talking about here?

It's of Cecil Rhodes, the namesake of the prestigious Rhodes scholarship. The successful South African businessman started the De Beers diamond company. He was also a colonialist who believed in the superiority of Anglo-Saxons, and he enforced a policy of racial segregation in South Africa. Now, a growing number of students on campus at Oxford say it's time to take down the Rhodes statue. Our next guest is a student at Oxford and an organizer with the Rhodes Must Fall campaign. Her name is Tadiwa Madenga. Thanks so much for being with us. TADIWA MADENGA: Thank you for having me. MARTIN: When you see this statue, what does it represent to you? MADENGA: To me, it represents two things. First, as a Zimbabwean person, I've known about Rhodes's legacy and there's never been this oh, he was a wonderful, successful businessman. We understood that he came and plundered the land as many colonizers did, and that a lot of people died from what he did. And there's a lot of structural injustice that resulted from the acts that Rhodes committed. And so when I look at the statue, I know of that legacy. But I also see the way Oxford wants to imagine itself today because they have not tried to reflect on Rhodes's legacy prior to the movement. It is only now that we have made them engage with this history that they have decided that perhaps, you know, they don't condone his actions. MARTIN: The chancellor of Oxford, Lord Chris Patten, has said that the statue should stay. He told the BBC - and I'm quoting here - \"People have to face up to facts in history which they don't like and talk about them and debate them. \" How do you respond that? MADENGA: The comments from the chancellor were surprising to us and, quite honestly, scandalous because on one hand, he was saying that we should have a generosity of spirit and we should be open-minded, but he's not open-minded to anyone who disagrees with his opinion. We think that debating means really seriously engaging with issues of colonial legacy and taking action to make sure the university is not institutionally racist, as opposed to just discussing over tea what our opinions are. And so Patten's comments, to me, just show this entitlement that certain people in administration have where if you disagree with them specifically, they feel like you should leave. MARTIN: Well, I imagine an extension of his argument is that learning from history means confronting sometimes very uncomfortable truths and ugly realities, and that removing the statue could potentially silence those conversations or symbolically erase history instead of having the statute there to promote debate. MADENGA: First, I want to say that once again, the university was not confronting this history prior to the movement. We want to say - what is a public space, and what are statues for? Statues are there to commemorate and to honor particular people. We do not put up statues of people we demonize for the sake of, you know, thinking of history or just debating. And so we are saying that you can remove the statue, you can put it in a museum where you can continue to discuss and debate. But where it is, at the entrance of Oriel College, at the very highest position above kings and provosts, is just ridiculous. It is not appropriate, and it is not the place where we should try to debate history. I think a museum would be a better place for that statue to be in. MARTIN: What has your experience at Oxford been like as a minority student? MADENGA: I think that it's been a shocking in terms of how much people in England really truly believe that colonization was a good thing. For example, one of our first actions for Rhodes Must Fall was at matriculation. That is your formal introduction to the university. And so we were outside and we were kind of trying to get engaged with students, see where they were at in terms of what they know about Rhodes. A lot of people don't know Rhodesia was a country. A lot of people really think colonization was this project to bring civilization in the form of schools and hospitals. And I think part of the problem in England is that a lot of people maybe who haven't traveled outside of England have not seen the consequences and the legacies of colonialism. So for some of us students who come from southern Africa, who still know about the racial inequality from particular economic structures, find this shocking when we come to England and people are not aware of the other side of colonization. MARTIN: Why is this movement happening now? MADENGA: First, our movement started with different types of protests happening. So you had the Black Lives Matter coming up. You had the Rhodes Must Fall movement in South Africa. And we see these connections, and we say this is also connected to how people look at history. So the fact that the university cares more about Rhodes being a benefactor as opposed to the lives that were lost because of his actions shows the way that people don't care about black lives. And I think globally, there has been a movement to kind of reveal this uncritical way of looking at history and the way that this uncritical reflection of history has led to some of the situations we have now, where black people are still dying over institutional oppression.

Freedom House says one-third of the world's population lives in areas plagued by repression and rights abuses. One-third, that's billions of people. Human Rights Watch warns of the greatest threat to human rights in a generation because of the fear of terrorism and the fear of popular uprisings. NPR's Peter Kenyon is covering this story from Istanbul, which is where Human Rights Watch is releasing its report this morning. And Peter, why Istanbul? PETER KENYON, BYLINE: Well, they say Turkey represents both the major themes in this report. It's overwhelmed with Syrian migrants, and at the same time, it's cracking down on dissent. The report talks about the migrant flow to Europe, recent terrorist attacks that have European and U. S. governments on edge. We have been tracking this, of course. But when I spoke with Ken Roth, director of Human Rights Watch, he pointed to a second trend going on at the same time and that is authoritarian leaders harshly cracking down on both their political opponents and civil society groups that are trying to make governments more accountable. Here's how he put it. KEN ROTH: A series of authoritarian governments are increasingly afraid of their societies. And in particular, they're afraid of the possibility of civic groups using social media to mobilize significant numbers in the streets to protest against misrule or corruption by the authoritarian leaders. INSKEEP: Wow, so a chain of cause and effect here, there's more social media, more free communication. Authoritarian governments feel more threatened, so they crack down more. Is that it? KENYON: Yeah, exactly. We've had years of chaos and conflict in Syria. Some may have forgotten that it all started as a popular uprising against the regime of Bashar al-Assad. Roth says other authoritarian leaders haven't forgotten that at all, and it's by no means limited to Mideast countries in the Arab Spring. There's the Ukraine revolution, the occupy movement in Hong Kong. And he says these social media-fueled uprisings really have grabbed attention in other capitals. Here's how he describes it. ROTH: Each of these started by a group of NGOs, civic groups, but they were able to magnify their voices and really rally many to the streets by using social media. And that is a combination that autocrats are terrified of. So they have taken the offensive and have tried to shut down the ability of these groups to organize. INSKEEP: OK, they have taken the offensive. Who's they? Who's doing this? KENYON: Well, the way he puts it is just as the activists were learning from other uprisings that some of these authoritarian leaders are watching each other and learning new techniques, finding out what works, who's doing it, Russia and China, very familiar names, are high on the list. He says they've been cracking down on dissent even more now as their economies stumble. Anti-terror laws are popular, but so is prosecution of civil society groups or academics as is happening here in Turkey, for example. And then there's the more subtle approach, and that's money. India is cutting off NGO funding. Ethiopia has a rule. You can only have 10 percent foreign funding if you're an NGO. And in a country that poor, that basically cripples civil society there. So it's a lot of countries on the list - Eritrea, Saudi Arabia, Vietnam. And I'm leaving a lot out. It's a long list. INSKEEP: I think some people might even be surprised by some of those names. When we hear India, we think world's largest democracy, but this report looks into India and finds a restricted environment. KENYON: That's exactly right. And he mentioned that it is surprising to see that name on that list, but that's what their evidence shows. INSKEEP: Now the Freedom House report, the other report that you are seeing today, had this number of one-third of the world's population living in repression. This is - is this actually a spread of authoritarian government around the world is getting worse than it was? KENYON: Yeah, they've been doing this survey for 10 years, and this is a big decline. They also cited nervous authoritarian rulers and the other factors we mentioned. They did point to a few rays of hope. Elections in Myanmar, Venezuela, Nigeria all rejected incumbents. And that at least suggests that elections might still hold out hope for change at least in some places. INSKEEP: Peter, thanks as always. KENYON: You're welcome, Steve.

I was impressed. But what do I know? Now a real authority is spending the week in Cuba, and he took some time out from his astute observations and perhaps a few mojitos to tell us what he thinks of the classic cars of Cuba. I'm joined now by Car Talks' Ray Magliozzi. Ray, how you doing? RAY MAGLIOZZI: (Laughter) Hi, Robert. How are you doing? You left out the Cohibas (laughter) - mojitos, Cohibas and the cars (laughter). SIEGEL: It's a dirty job, but somebody's got to do it. First, what exactly are you doing in Havana? MAGLIOZZI: What are we doing? SIEGEL: Yeah. (LAUGHTER)SIEGEL: Is there - I mean. . . MAGLIOZZI: Besides drinking mojitos, having Cuban coffee. . . SIEGEL: Apart from the Cohibas, mojitos and drinking the mojitos and looking at the cars. . . MAGLIOZZI: Is there a goal? Is there an intended purpose? SIEGEL: (Laughter) Well, not to put too fine a point on it - yes. MAGLIOZZI: Robert, we're being journalists for goodness sakes, and we're trying to ascertain how these cars stay on the roads. SIEGEL: So tell me. As I observed, you probably saw some exceptional cars driving around in Havana. What do you think? What is this - does it make you feel young again? MAGLIOZZI: Well, exactly that. I mean, I obviously haven't seen cars of this vintage since I was a little kid. SIEGEL: What do you think about the maintenance of these cars - think you could have kept as much of these cars on the road as you see in Havana? MAGLIOZZI: No. I've been constantly impressed by the cleverness and the sheer determination of the people who keep these cars going. It's amazing. So lots of the cars that we've taken as taxis, for example, do not have the original engines. But, you know, it's funny. Stuff I read about Cuba before I came suggested that it didn't really make much a difference how they put these cars together because most of the roads were dirt roads. Nobody went over 20 miles an hour, and the cars were just a curiosity and a conveyance that was not to be relied upon. However, that couldn't be farther from the truth. These cars, you know, driving 50, 60 miles an hour (laughter). I was very happy that they put as much effort into maintaining the brakes on these cars as they had the engines and the transmissions because, you know, with no seatbelts and metal dashboards, it could be over in an instant (laughter). . . SIEGEL: Yes. MAGLIOZZI: . . . If you know to mean. SIEGEL: Yes, I know what you mean. And somehow they had to do this - getting parts. I mean, you can have a new engine under the hood. But you know, the dashboard should still look like the dashboard, and all of the appurtenance of the car should look appropriate. So. . . MAGLIOZZI: Well, interestingly, I rode in a taxi yesterday that had had also a complete dashboard transplant. It was a late-model GM - late-model (laughter) 50. . . SIEGEL: 1961? MAGLIOZZI: '58. SIEGEL: Oh, '58? MAGLIOZZI: '58 Oldsmobile had gotten a whole new instrument panel, and he said he got it from the states. So he must've had a relative bring this thing in, so it was something that was customized to fit into that hole that had existed for the original instrumentation. So it had a new ammeter and a new oil pressure gauge and all that, and they all worked. I have yet to see a car, however, that has a speedometer that works. SIEGEL: (Laughter) I see. I see. Are there any pollution controls in these cars? MAGLIOZZI: Are you kidding? (LAUGHTER)MAGLIOZZI: The only thing that's kept us from keeling over is the paucity of cars on the road. (LAUGHTER)SIEGEL: So tell me, I mean, Ray, which do you think is more the case? Do you think that Cubans hungry for a post-embargo era can't wait to get a hold of some 2016 model Hundais and Nissans or that this shtick has really become part of Havana's culture, that people want to drive around in 60-year-old Chevrolets? MAGLIOZZI: Oh, I think people would lunge at the newer cars in a minute if they could afford them. I don't think there's any question about that. You know, I mean, while this is fun and it's been done obviously out of necessity, I think if newer cars were to come in - first of all, it would change the Cuban economy tremendously, so there's going to be a lot that's going to happen. But I think that - there's no doubt in my mind that the average Cuban, if he had a chance, would love to drive a new car. SIEGEL: Well, Ray, thanks for sharing the fruits of your journalistic investigation with us. MAGLIOZZI: Robert, it was my pleasure. SIEGEL: (Laughter) OK. That's Ray Magliozzi of Car Talk talking with us from Havana. ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:   About a year ago, I went to Cuba for the first time, and I took some time to appreciate the famously still operating 1950s American cars on the streets of Havana. I was impressed. But what do I know? Now a real authority is spending the week in Cuba, and he took some time out from his astute observations and perhaps a few mojitos to tell us what he thinks of the classic cars of Cuba. I'm joined now by Car Talks' Ray Magliozzi. Ray, how you doing? RAY MAGLIOZZI: (Laughter) Hi, Robert. How are you doing? You left out the Cohibas (laughter) - mojitos, Cohibas and the cars (laughter). SIEGEL: It's a dirty job, but somebody's got to do it. First, what exactly are you doing in Havana? MAGLIOZZI: What are we doing? SIEGEL: Yeah. (LAUGHTER) SIEGEL: Is there - I mean. . . MAGLIOZZI: Besides drinking mojitos, having Cuban coffee. . . SIEGEL: Apart from the Cohibas, mojitos and drinking the mojitos and looking at the cars. . . MAGLIOZZI: Is there a goal? Is there an intended purpose? SIEGEL: (Laughter) Well, not to put too fine a point on it - yes. MAGLIOZZI: Robert, we're being journalists for goodness sakes, and we're trying to ascertain how these cars stay on the roads. SIEGEL: So tell me. As I observed, you probably saw some exceptional cars driving around in Havana. What do you think? What is this - does it make you feel young again? MAGLIOZZI: Well, exactly that. I mean, I obviously haven't seen cars of this vintage since I was a little kid. SIEGEL: What do you think about the maintenance of these cars - think you could have kept as much of these cars on the road as you see in Havana? MAGLIOZZI: No. I've been constantly impressed by the cleverness and the sheer determination of the people who keep these cars going. It's amazing. So lots of the cars that we've taken as taxis, for example, do not have the original engines. But, you know, it's funny. Stuff I read about Cuba before I came suggested that it didn't really make much a difference how they put these cars together because most of the roads were dirt roads. Nobody went over 20 miles an hour, and the cars were just a curiosity and a conveyance that was not to be relied upon. However, that couldn't be farther from the truth. These cars, you know, driving 50, 60 miles an hour (laughter). I was very happy that they put as much effort into maintaining the brakes on these cars as they had the engines and the transmissions because, you know, with no seatbelts and metal dashboards, it could be over in an instant (laughter). . . SIEGEL: Yes. MAGLIOZZI: . . . If you know to mean. SIEGEL: Yes, I know what you mean. And somehow they had to do this - getting parts. I mean, you can have a new engine under the hood. But you know, the dashboard should still look like the dashboard, and all of the appurtenance of the car should look appropriate. So. . . MAGLIOZZI: Well, interestingly, I rode in a taxi yesterday that had had also a complete dashboard transplant. It was a late-model GM - late-model (laughter) 50. . . SIEGEL: 1961? MAGLIOZZI: '58. SIEGEL: Oh, '58? MAGLIOZZI: '58 Oldsmobile had gotten a whole new instrument panel, and he said he got it from the states. So he must've had a relative bring this thing in, so it was something that was customized to fit into that hole that had existed for the original instrumentation. So it had a new ammeter and a new oil pressure gauge and all that, and they all worked. I have yet to see a car, however, that has a speedometer that works. SIEGEL: (Laughter) I see. I see. Are there any pollution controls in these cars? MAGLIOZZI: Are you kidding? (LAUGHTER) MAGLIOZZI: The only thing that's kept us from keeling over is the paucity of cars on the road. (LAUGHTER) SIEGEL: So tell me, I mean, Ray, which do you think is more the case?

DIMAKOU: They are from Syria, Morocco, Algeria and Afghanistan and Somalia. KAKISSIS: Dimakou left a law career in Athens to work with the children. In Greece, a district attorney is supposed to be the temporary legal guardian of migrant children. DIMAKOU: He is just responsible for signing any paperwork or taking any decision that have to do with a child, but he never meets them personally, for example.

I'm Terry Gross. The world's most radical social experiment - that's how China's one-child policy is described in the new book \"One Child\" by my guest, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Mei Fong. The policy was created in 1980 by the Chinese government to limit population growth by regulating how many children married couples could have. Although there were exceptions written into the one child limit, the rules were strictly enforced. Last fall, the government announced the policy would be updated to allow couples to have two children. Fong's book is about how the policy has left China with a disproportionate number of old people and males and has changed family life. Fong traveled to a bachelor village in rural China with no women of marriageable age. She talked to people who had been pressured to be sterilized after the birth of one child, but then that one child died. She learned about forced abortions, unlicensed children who are confiscated by the authorities and what it's like for adult children who don't have siblings to help share the responsibilities of caring for older parents in failing health. Fong started writing the book when she was a Wall Street Journal correspondent based in China. She's now a fellow at New America. Mei Fong, welcome to FRESH AIR. So you decided to focus on the single-child policy when you were covering the earthquake in Sichuan that killed 70,000 people. You were a reporter for The Wall Street Journal at the time. And you were with a couple when they found out that their daughter was one of the children killed during the earthquake when the roof of the school collapsed. So this was a couple that had the one child that they were allowed, and now that child was dead. So obviously, they were emotionally devastated, but you know, beyond just the loss - beyond just, like, the emotional loss, the devastating loss of this child, there are consequences that they knew would kind of have ripple effects for the rest of their lives. What were some of those consequences? MEI FONG: Well, it means a lot, economically speaking, because a lot of families still don't have any kind of a financial security, so losing one child is basically a pension pen-in (ph), so that's one thing. And for the Chinese, culturally speaking, the continuance of the family life is very important. So when you die without any issue, you are basically violating all sorts of, you know, your duties to your ancestors, which is very important. And certainly because, you know, Chinese society is still very family-centric, even if it's just a smaller family size. You're not considered fully an adult until you are married, and you are not considered complete until you have a child. And when you lose that child, you fall quite far down the societal totem pole. So for example, this family that I covered that had lost their only child, they lost a lot of status in their village. They said that their neighbors were avoiding them and shunning them basically, that they were worried that these - childless couple would now be hangers-on, clinging onto them, borrowing money, not having any sort of protection. So that's what losing your one child means. And then today in Chinese context, there's a name for these people who've lost their only child, shidu. And it means, you know, parents who've lost their only child. And for parents who are shidu, some of them find it hard to get admitted into nursing homes. Some nursing homes won't take them. They say you have no progeny to authorize treatments or payments or anything, so we prefer not to admit you. They also have difficulty buying funeral plots for the same reason. You know, who's going to service the maintenance costs of your cemetery down the line? So these are very sad issues. GROSS: And it's not like this couple could have had a second child because at the time, if you came under the one-child policy and you had that one child, you were expected to be sterilized. FONG: Be sterilized. GROSS: And so the husband in this couple had had a vasectomy, so they didn't have the option of having another child. He tried to reverse it, but that failed. FONG: He tried to reverse it, and it was actually an operation that succeeded, they said. The doctors told me that it was technically a success, but he was 50. His wife was 45. So the chances of them conceiving were quite low. GROSS: So the one-child policy in China was not as straightforward as it might seem. So could you explain what the policy was and who was affected by it? FONG: Well, what we call the one-child policy for simplicity is actually a basket of rules governing family size in China. And the basic idea was to encourage everybody, by coercion, if necessary, to keep to, if possible, one child. And that was for a majority of urban household, so about a third of all Chinese households in total. And for other parts of the region, they would have some certain exceptions because they found that they could not make everybody keep to that one-child rule without allowing for certain exceptions. So you could technically have a second child if you had a certain job that was hazardous, like if you were a coal miner or a fisherman. But you could also have a second child maybe if you were one of China's minority tribes or if you lived in a rural area and your first child was a girl. And, you know, they recognized that, you know, a lot of people want to try for sons. But the end result was that with all these exceptions coming down the line, a lot of people didn't really necessarily know what the rules were. And so it was very easy to contravene them and be fined for them, so that was a hard part. GROSS: So what was the rationale behind these restrictions on children? FONG: China, at the time, you know, when this whole population-planning policy was formulated, was very concerned about the fact that their population was growing at a hugely exponential rate. There was a baby boom in the '60s and '70s, so - you know, and Mao encouraged it, you know, during the communist planning times. You know, he believed that increasing productivity was a strength, so - in that time period, so a lot of people had more children. This was coming after, you know, a turbulent time. So - but the problem was they wanted China to advance, and there was a sense that, you know, if you had too many people straining your resources, then that would be a big issue going down the line. But China was actually already embarking on a sort of a population-planning policy before the one-child, and that was in the 1970s. They had something in place already called the later, longer and fewer campaign, and it was much less coercive than a one-child policy. What it did was it encouraged people to get married later, have fewer children and space a longer period between their children. And during a time period in the '70s to the '80s - in a 10-year period where they had that policy in place, the average family size in China went from six children per family to three. So it's quite conceivable they would have, you know, continued in that trajectory, and their population would have fallen without having to go to this very drastic one-child solution. GROSS: You call the one-child policy the world's most radical social experiment. I get the impression from your book that the Chinese government had no idea exactly how radical it would turn out to be and how - what an extreme effect it would have on the demographics of the country. Like, give us an example of, say, the ratio of older people to younger people now. FONG: Well, the one-child policy drastically reshaped the composition on China's - their people. So now, they have a population that's basically too old and too male and down the line, maybe too few. So the too old issue is - you know, right now China has a dependency ratio of about five working adults to support one retiree. That's pretty good. That's a very healthy ratio. In about 20 years, that's going to jump to about 1. 6 working adults to support one retiree. And that's because, you know, China - you know, that big population boom that we talked about, that big cohort of people are all living longer and getting older and, therefore, hitting their 70s, 80s and 90s. So by the time 2050 comes around, 1 in 4 Chinese people will be a retiree. You know, that entire population of retirees in China would be the third largest nation in this world if they were to form their own country. So that has nothing to do with the one-child policy, that's just a function of, you know, people living longer and growing older. But the problem is then you have this very small working cohort to support them. And that has everything to do with the one-child policy. You just, you know, drastically shrank the number of working adults to support this huge, aging tsunami, and that's the problem going ahead. GROSS: And what about the gender imbalance in China? Boys have been prized over girls. Were a lot of female fetuses aborted because parents wanted to hold out for a son instead of a daughter? FONG: You know, that's the thing. You know, and China, for a very long time, has been a culture that prized sons. And it's not the only one, obviously. You know, even England for example, when we look back at things like Jane Austen, that was what it was all about. Sons mattered more. Sons inherited. The problem is when you created a system where you would shrink the size of a family, and people would have to choose. Then people would, you know, evermore choose sons. And so the problem then became, down the line, now China has 30 million more men than women, 30 million bachelors who cannot find brides. Numerically, there are just not enough women going around. And these are men, you know, farmers, who will not be able to get married. They call them guang guan, broken branches, that's the name in Chinese. They are the biological dead ends of their family. Now, 30 million men, that's about the population of Canada, so that's huge. You know, there's just no way you can import enough women in to meet that huge demand. GROSS: So is there an estimate of how many female fetuses were aborted that ended up in this kind of imbalance? Because, you know, you write that there was a policy that the health care worker couldn't tell the woman who was having a sonogram or whatever what the gender of the baby was, but that a lot of health care workers managed to give a clue anyway. So did women have ways of finding out and then choose to abort the females? FONG: Yeah. In the beginning, right - when the policy came around in 1980, at that time, they did not have scanning machines that could determine the gender of the fetus at an early stage. So people who delivered girls, for example, and wanted to keep their quota for that one boy, because if you used up your quota for a girl and then you gave birth to another girl, then you would lose that. So people would either abandon your daughters, or there would be infanticide, or they would give them away, which is part of the reason why we saw so many adoptions of China's babies, mostly girls, in the West. But later on, in the 1990s, technology made it easier for people to do all these scans. Companies like General Electric, you know, made these scanning machines that were portable and small enough that you could go from village to village. And you could determine the sex or the gender of your fetus for as little as $10 or $20. So people would just have an abortion instead of carrying their child to full term. So as a result of that, I think the Nobel economist Amartya Sen estimated there were about 100 million missing women - women that were never born or killed or aborted across Asia. Later, estimates kind of bore fruit that those figures were roughly about 100, 120 million. And out of that, about 50 or 60 million would have been women in China, so that's what's missing. GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is journalist Mei Fong. Her new book is called \"One Child\", and it's about the one-child policy in China, which was the policy from 1980 until the end of last year. Mei, let's take a short break here and then we'll talk some more about the one-child policy in China and what it's meant for men and women, for families and for the country as a whole. We'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)GROSS: This is FRESH AIR, and if you're just joining us, my guest is Mei Fong. She's the author of the new book, \"One Child,\" and it's the story of China's one-child policy, which applied to many but not all of Chinese families. As she says, it was a basket of rules regulating how many children families were allowed to have and in what circumstances. The policy lasted from 1980 to 2015. Now there's a two-child policy, which means there's still a lot of regulations determining who's aloud to have children and how many. Her new book is called \"One Child. \" She's a Pulitzer prize-winning reporter - former reporter for The Wall Street Journal. Let's talk about how the one-child policy was enforced. So if a couple had one child and was not supposed to have a second, say the woman got pregnant - then what? FONG: Well, if she lived in a small village, for example, she would probably be scrutinized by a group. She would probably be grouped together with a set of households and come under what they call a cluster leader, somebody who sort of monitors the progress and fertility rights of a certain set of households. So, I met one cluster leader, for example, who used to keep a board where she would write down, you know, when women in her 10 households would have their periods, what kind of contraceptives they use, how many children they had - so on and so forth - she would have to track. So if this woman, for example, fell pregnant, then most likely this cluster leader would know about it very quickly. And then she would report to higher-up, and then the screws would come in, you know. Probably at first, a village leader would show on her doorstep and say look, you know, you know very well you shouldn't have this. You could have all sorts of problems with this. You might have to pay a fine. I've met enforcers who have gone to these houses and say, well, we used to take away something valuable to show that we mean business. If the couple. . . GROSS: Take away something valuable to show we mean - what does that mean? FONG: Well, like a television set, for example - or a pig. Or sometimes, if the household was a very poor household, they would take away homespun cloth or grain or something - you know, something that had to made it hurt, basically. And that was in a village setting, of course. In a city setting, it could maybe - if you worked for a civil servant - you know, service-linked job, they might, you know, threaten to fire you. GROSS: And this was for having a child or for just being pregnant? FONG: This was having a child. If you went for a termination, all this would go away. But of course, then there were people who really wanted the child. And then they would try and evade the whole process of being taken away for a forced abortion because here's the thing. Between your conception and delivery date, you know, all bets are off. They can make you - you know, remove the impediment. GROSS: Yeah, that's what I was wondering. Do they come and threaten you and take your TV and say, you'll only get this back if you have an abortion? Or do they just, like, take you to the abortion clinic and give you the abortion? FONG: I think it starts at sort of a level of persuasion. So they say, think about it. We'll come back tomorrow. Or, you know, we've got this tractor taking everybody to the - or this truck that will be taking everybody to the clinic on this date. You show up on this date, and you'll be fine. And if you miss that date, they'd come back again and threaten. And then, you know, and then so on and so forth. And so it becomes a matter of a hide-and-seek process for some people who desperately want to keep their child. So - and they hope to carry it to full term and then deliver it as a complee (ph). And then, of course, even though they are are still hit with fines, the child's living. It's born. It's there. But the problem becomes when it's still in the mother's stomach because then it's still - then it's still considered fair game for a lot of family planning officials. Theoretically speaking, forced abortions are illegal after the sixth month. But in practice, it happened. It happened as late as 2012, where there was a case of a woman, Feng Jianmei, who was - she was a rural (ph) woman. And she believed, and she wanted very much to have a second child. And they told her she couldn't. And they kept coming at her and saying, all right, if you're going to have the second child, you're going to have to pay something like 6,000 U. S. dollars. She and her husband worked in factories. They couldn't afford it. They tried to sort of see if they could pay less. And it went back and forth until she was in her seventh month, when they took her away to the hospital with a pillow case over her head and injected her with something that caused her to abort the 7-month fetus. GROSS: You talked with some of the people who had to enforce the one-child policy and either lead people to abortions or fine them for becoming pregnant after already having had a child. Tell us one of the stories you were told by one of the enforcers, or the population police, as you call them. FONG: There was a woman, and I tracked her down. Her name was Gao Xiaoduan (ph). And she's now living in America. She had been responsible for something like 1,500 abortions, out of which about a third were late-term abortions. And she had testified before Congress that she had worked as a mid-level family planning official in the southern China. And she gave a whole wealth of detail, basically, about, you know, what was the whole - how the business was conducted and how coercion was employed. You know, and one of the things she talked about was, you know, jails - you know, black (ph) jails that they would have. Basically, one of the ways in which you would persuade people to show up for an abortion would be to put a relative of theirs - you know, typically a mother, she would say - into the jail. I've seen these pictures of these cells, by the way. They just look like steel-bar cells. And she would say, OK, your mother's in jail. And she's going to stay there until you show up and come for an abortion. And so - you know, this is kind of the pressure or tactic employed too. And by the way, that period where they put, you know, that relative in jail, they would also charge that relative every day for, you know, a certain amount for food and so on. So, you know, a lot of people who would feel, you know, at some point bound to show up. And it wasn't necessarily just for abortions. It would also be for sterilizations too. You know, you say, OK, you know, your mother's going to be in jail until you show up for that sterilization operation. GROSS: Let's talk about how this policy, the one-child policy, has affected women in China. On the one hand, a lot of female fetuses were aborted because if you're only allowed to have one child, in China you're more likely to want that child to be a boy rather than a girl. But on the opposite side, you write that women in China, after the one-child policy, were more likely to get adequate food, education, jobs, opportunities than ever before in Chinese history. Why is that? FONG: Well, let's say you were born after 1980 in a big city. Chances are, you probably don't have a sibling. And if you're a girl and you don't have a sibling, then you don't have to fight with your sibling for resources. So, you know, your parents will want to send you to college. They won't be able to - they won't be debating a question of whether they should spend the money on your brother or yourself. It's all for you. So, you know - so imagine this scenario replicated, you know, a million times over. And the end result is, you know, women born - especially urban women - born after 1980 achieved way more than any other generation before them. GROSS: Are you saying, too, that your parents wouldn't automatically be favoring the brother over the daughter if there was no brother - if there was only a daughter? FONG: Yeah, no brother, nothing, right? Only a daughter - and not only that. I mean, if you're living in a city environment, then a daughter can just as equally earn money in a white-collar job as a son. You know, it's not a question of, you know, physical strength the way it is when you're on a farm, where boys count for more than girls because boys can lift and do more heavy farm work. So women, as a result, prospered. At least urban women did, a certain subsection of urban women. GROSS: My guest is Mei Fong, author of the new book, \"One Child: The Story Of China's Most Radical Experiment. \" After we take a short break, we'll talk about her personal connection to the story. Also, John Powers will review the new FX miniseries about the O. J. Simpson trial, and jazz critic Kevin Whitehead will play some of the earliest jazz recordings. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross back with Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Mei Fong. We're talking about her new book, \"One Child,\" which is about China's one child policy, which limited the number of children a married couple was allowed to have. The policy began in 1980. At the end of last year, it was revised to allow couples to have two children. As a result of the one child policy, China is now disproportionately old and male. Fong started the book when she was a Wall Street Journal reporter based in China. As part of her research, she spoke to parents and children whose lives were shaped by the one child policy. You spoke to a girl who wasn't, quote, \"registered\" because once you're born you have to be registered so that they know this couple, this family, has had their child. And the authorities know if somebody has to be sterilized, if they want to advise an abortion if there was another pregnancy. So this was a girl who wasn't registered. Why wasn't she registered? And what did it mean to not be registered? FONG: So a lot of things in China are tied to what you call your household registration. They call it the Hukou. So - what kind of jobs you can get, what kind of schooling you have, it's all tied to your Hukou, and where you get your Hukou begins right with the birth permit that your parents got when they were pregnant with you. So it all comes to that. So if you don't have a birth permit, it's very hard to get the Hukou. If you don't get the Hukou, it's very hard to get schooling, medical care. This girl that I spoke to, her name was Leesha (ph), she couldn't so much as get a library card or buy a train ticket because she didn't have a Hukou. And at the time when I spoke to her, she was in her 20s, she had never gone to school at all and she was living in Beijing. She wasn't living in some small town in the middle of nowhere. She was living in a very crowded metro city and she had never, ever been to school because she didn't have that. So they call this kind of an unregistered child a heihaizi, a black child, literally translated. And there are about thirteen million of these heihaizi, unregistered children, and some of them not necessarily children who are sort of nonentities. You know, you might call them undocumented migrant workers, you know, the context of what Westerners might understand because they don't have any rights. GROSS: In the social structure in China the way you describe it, parents as they age really rely on their children to help support them in old age. There isn't a social safety net in China. But now that there's been a one child policy in place since 1980, there's a lot of families where there's, like, one person, like, one child who has to support his or her aging parents who, you know, may be in failing health. And in most families now, there's not siblings to help a child support their parents, and so there's a lot of pressure on children now. How did you see that being manifested? FONG: When I was in China, starting from the mid-2000s, we used to have this thing they called the Little Emperors, right? This is a very common sight you would see in parks and restaurants - one cute little kid surrounded by a gaggle of adults, usually the parents, the two sets of grandparents, you know, all hustling around this one little kid. So that was what they called the xiao huangdi, the Little Emperor. But if you fast-forward, the first generation from the one child is now in their mid-30s so - and you have parents in the 50s or 60s, grandparents are 80s and 90s. So that balance is shifting so, you know, that child is now an adult, and an adult has to return back that care and love to a set of ailing adults, and without the benefit of any siblings to share that. I somehow think that sometimes having brothers or sisters is something probably we only really appreciate when we're much older, probably not when we're children. And, you know, if you'd at least look at the numbers alone, right, I mean, China has something like a quarter of the world's Parkinson's sufferers right now already, just by the sheer number of old people they have. In a matter of 20-something years, that percentage is actually going to jump up to something like 60-something percent, and, you know, all the numbers will be the same for Alzheimer's and dementia and all sorts of things like that. So it's a huge strain not necessarily just financially but emotionally as well. GROSS: So if you stand back and look at, like, you know, China as having had this, like, amazing economic boom, how much of that do you think is attributable to the population control that resulted from the one child policy? FONG: Two words for that - very little. I know that it's very hard for us to think that way because the one child policy basically happened at the same time when China opened up economically, and China for the last 30-something years has had double-digit GDP growth, therefore, ergo it must be connected, right? That is the line of thinking that's very popular. But here's the thing. I mean, basically when China opened up economically, what it did was it dropped all these socialist-planned economy stuff which wasn't working. They moved people from the country to the cities, they encouraged foreign investment and they did all these things which are so much more the reason why China's had this double-digit GDP growth, and it has really nothing to do with the one child policy. I mean, one of the main reasons why China grew so fast economically is because of this manufacturing boom they had, and a manufacturing boom is because of the cheap labor they had, and cheap labor is because of a lot of people, not fewer people. It's a result of the cohort that were born in the '60s and '70s before before the one child policy and were grown up and old enough to work in the factories at the time when China opened its doors. So really, you know, if you - I talked to a couple - quite a lot of economists about this, and, you know - many reasons for China's blistering economic growth, and very little of it has to do with the one child policy. GROSS: When you started writing your book, \"One Child,\" you were pregnant. And so here you were writing about all these, like, fertility issues and restrictions on, you know, families' rights to have more children, and you were trying to start a family of your own, but also while writing this book, you had a miscarriage. And also while writing this book, you had fertility issues because you have a hormonal disorder that affected your fertility. And so that gave you great insight, I think, into how really difficult it is for, you know, for a government to regulate a woman's fertility - because a woman's fertility, you know, you can prevent your body from conceiving, you can try to help it but some women will never conceive no matter matter how hard they try. You can't control biology that easily. FONG: Well, yeah, that's the whole point. I mean. . . GROSS: Oh, and then you can't turn it back on. You can't say, OK, women, now we need you to conceive because there's not enough young people so start conceiving. You know, biology doesn't always work that way. FONG: Yeah, you're right, write Terry. I mean, biology can be controlled only to a certain extent, fertility can only be controlled to a certain extent. Family life, the regulation of it, can only be controlled to a certain extent. At some point, we have to allow this space for personal choice and decision into that matter, and I think when we don't, these are the tragedies that occur and that's what I try to explore in the book with the stories of individual people. GROSS: Now, another interesting story related to your \"One Child\" book is your extended family's story. Your paternal grandfather had 18 sons. I'll say that again - 18 sons. And your father was the 16th of those sons. Then your father married your mother, she had five daughters, one of whom was you. FONG: Yes, I was the last one, the fifth one - the last hope for the son. GROSS: And your mother was considered kind of deficient by your father's family because all she had was daughters. They wanted sons. So what do you see when you look at your family history of sons and daughters and the favoring of sons over daughters? FONG: Well, I see the microcosm of what Chinese culture has brought forth. You know, I should make clear at this point, I'm ethnically Chinese but I'm not nationally Chinese. I am third-generation Chinese. My grandparents were from China. They migrated to Malaysia. So we're what you call Huaquiao, overseas Chinese, who are actually considered very traditional. We cling to the old ways a lot. So my family was very son-loving. GROSS: How did your father, coming from a culture and from a family that preferred sons over daughters, how did your father deal with having five daughters and no sons? FONG: He was a very disappointed man. You know, my father was not a farmer. He was - he worked in the civil service. He had been trained as an accountant, but you know, he still had all these notions in his head that his sons were really necessary and that they were important, to, you know - they made you a man, they made you somehow more relevant. And he used to rail at us all the time and say that you are nothing but liabilities, you are not assets, you are liabilities. And so we grew up, you know, very much feeling like second-class citizens as daughters, as Chinese daughters. GROSS: He didn't say that ironically, he really meant it? FONG: No, he really meant that, he really did. And then he had a stroke at 57 so, you know, he was very angry and very disappointed. GROSS: Was your mother disappointed by having five daughters? FONG: I mean, she loved us, but you know, you could feel it. And I was too young at the time to sort of see it, but, you know, at clan gatherings and stuff, there was always these slights, these things - and my grandmother was really nasty, too. My grandmother really loved boy cousins so every time we'd play, we learned to avoid her because she would always pinch us - the girls, you know, she really didn't like us. And this all sounds so feudalistic and something that would happen maybe a hundred years ago, but it wasn't that long ago at all. GROSS: So you are now the mother of twins. They're both boys (laughter). FONG: Yeah. I didn't do anything with the choosing of that, but I really wanted a girl. (Laughter). GROSS: Were you surprised to have twins? FONG: I wasn't because it was IVF, and here's the thing, right? The fertility issue - I was having trouble, and, you know, multiples are, you know, a very common result of IVF. And one of the things I discovered when I was having IVF in China were that there were quite a lot of women in the clinic I was going to who weren't going there necessarily because they were infertile but because they wanted multiples because this is one way to get around the one child policy. Twins or triplets are counted as a single birth so you will not have to pay the fines, you will not lose your job. And so it was kind of like a buy one, get one free kind of a concept. GROSS: Well, thank you so much for talking with us, I really appreciate it. FONG: Thanks Terry. GROSS: Mei Fong is the author of, \"One Child: The Story Of China's Most Radical Experiment. \" After we take a short break, John Powers will review the new FX miniseries about the O. J. Simpson trial with Cuba Gooding Jr. as O. J. This is FRESH AIR. TERRY GROSS, HOST:  This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. The world's most radical social experiment - that's how China's one-child policy is described in the new book \"One Child\" by my guest, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Mei Fong. The policy was created in 1980 by the Chinese government to limit population growth by regulating how many children married couples could have. Although there were exceptions written into the one child limit, the rules were strictly enforced. Last fall, the government announced the policy would be updated to allow couples to have two children. Fong's book is about how the policy has left China with a disproportionate number of old people and males and has changed family life. Fong traveled to a bachelor village in rural China with no women of marriageable age. She talked to people who had been pressured to be sterilized after the birth of one child, but then that one child died. She learned about forced abortions, unlicensed children who are confiscated by the authorities and what it's like for adult children who don't have siblings to help share the responsibilities of caring for older parents in failing health. Fong started writing the book when she was a Wall Street Journal correspondent based in China. She's now a fellow at New America. Mei Fong, welcome to FRESH AIR. So you decided to focus on the single-child policy when you were covering the earthquake in Sichuan that killed 70,000 people. You were a reporter for The Wall Street Journal at the time. And you were with a couple when they found out that their daughter was one of the children killed during the earthquake when the roof of the school collapsed. So this was a couple that had the one child that they were allowed, and now that child was dead. So obviously, they were emotionally devastated, but you know, beyond just the loss - beyond just, like, the emotional loss, the devastating loss of this child, there are consequences that they knew would kind of have ripple effects for the rest of their lives. What were some of those consequences? MEI FONG: Well, it means a lot, economically speaking, because a lot of families still don't have any kind of a financial security, so losing one child is basically a pension pen-in (ph), so that's one thing. And for the Chinese, culturally speaking, the continuance of the family life is very important. So when you die without any issue, you are basically violating all sorts of, you know, your duties to your ancestors, which is very important. And certainly because, you know, Chinese society is still very family-centric, even if it's just a smaller family size. You're not considered fully an adult until you are married, and you are not considered complete until you have a child. And when you lose that child, you fall quite far down the societal totem pole. So for example, this family that I covered that had lost their only child, they lost a lot of status in their village. They said that their neighbors were avoiding them and shunning them basically, that they were worried that these - childless couple would now be hangers-on, clinging onto them, borrowing money, not having any sort of protection. So that's what losing your one child means. And then today in Chinese context, there's a name for these people who've lost their only child, shidu. And it means, you know, parents who've lost their only child. And for parents who are shidu, some of them find it hard to get admitted into nursing homes. Some nursing homes won't take them. They say you have no progeny to authorize treatments or payments or anything, so we prefer not to admit you. They also have difficulty buying funeral plots for the same reason. You know, who's going to service the maintenance costs of your cemetery down the line? So these are very sad issues. GROSS: And it's not like this couple could have had a second child because at the time, if you came under the one-child policy and you had that one child, you were expected to be sterilized. FONG: Be sterilized. GROSS: And so the husband in this couple had had a vasectomy, so they didn't have the option of having another child. He tried to reverse it, but that failed. FONG: He tried to reverse it, and it was actually an operation that succeeded, they said. The doctors told me that it was technically a success, but he was 50. His wife was 45. So the chances of them conceiving were quite low. GROSS: So the one-child policy in China was not as straightforward as it might seem. So could you explain what the policy was and who was affected by it? FONG: Well, what we call the one-child policy for simplicity is actually a basket of rules governing family size in China. And the basic idea was to encourage everybody, by coercion, if necessary, to keep to, if possible, one child. And that was for a majority of urban household, so about a third of all Chinese households in total. And for other parts of the region, they would have some certain exceptions because they found that they could not make everybody keep to that one-child rule without allowing for certain exceptions. So you could technically have a second child if you had a certain job that was hazardous, like if you were a coal miner or a fisherman. But you could also have a second child maybe if you were one of China's minority tribes or if you lived in a rural area and your first child was a girl. And, you know, they recognized that, you know, a lot of people want to try for sons. But the end result was that with all these exceptions coming down the line, a lot of people didn't really necessarily know what the rules were. And so it was very easy to contravene them and be fined for them, so that was a hard part. GROSS: So what was the rationale behind these restrictions on children? FONG: China, at the time, you know, when this whole population-planning policy was formulated, was very concerned about the fact that their population was growing at a hugely exponential rate. There was a baby boom in the '60s and '70s, so - you know, and Mao encouraged it, you know, during the communist planning times. You know, he believed that increasing productivity was a strength, so - in that time period, so a lot of people had more children. This was coming after, you know, a turbulent time. So - but the problem was they wanted China to advance, and there was a sense that, you know, if you had too many people straining your resources, then that would be a big issue going down the line. But China was actually already embarking on a sort of a population-planning policy before the one-child, and that was in the 1970s. They had something in place already called the later, longer and fewer campaign, and it was much less coercive than a one-child policy. What it did was it encouraged people to get married later, have fewer children and space a longer period between their children. And during a time period in the '70s to the '80s - in a 10-year period where they had that policy in place, the average family size in China went from six children per family to three. So it's quite conceivable they would have, you know, continued in that trajectory, and their population would have fallen without having to go to this very drastic one-child solution. GROSS: You call the one-child policy the world's most radical social experiment. I get the impression from your book that the Chinese government had no idea exactly how radical it would turn out to be and how - what an extreme effect it would have on the demographics of the country. Like, give us an example of, say, the ratio of older people to younger people now. FONG: Well, the one-child policy drastically reshaped the composition on China's - their people. So now, they have a population that's basically too old and too male and down the line, maybe too few. So the too old issue is - you know, right now China has a dependency ratio of about five working adults to support one retiree. That's pretty good. That's a very healthy ratio. In about 20 years, that's going to jump to about 1. 6 working adults to support one retiree. And that's because, you know, China - you know, that big population boom that we talked about, that big cohort of people are all living longer and getting older and, therefore, hitting their 70s, 80s and 90s. So by the time 2050 comes around, 1 in 4 Chinese people will be a retiree. You know, that entire population of retirees in China would be the third largest nation in this world if they were to form their own country. So that has nothing to do with the one-child policy, that's just a function of, you know, people living longer and growing older. But the problem is then you have this very small working cohort to support them. And that has everything to do with the one-child policy. You just, you know, drastically shrank the number of working adults to support this huge, aging tsunami, and that's the problem going ahead. GROSS: And what about the gender imbalance in China? Boys have been prized over girls. Were a lot of female fetuses aborted because parents wanted to hold out for a son instead of a daughter? FONG: You know, that's the thing. You know, and China, for a very long time, has been a culture that prized sons. And it's not the only one, obviously. You know, even England for example, when we look back at things like Jane Austen, that was what it was all about. Sons mattered more. Sons inherited. The problem is when you created a system where you would shrink the size of a family, and people would have to choose. Then people would, you know, evermore choose sons. And so the problem then became, down the line, now China has 30 million more men than women, 30 million bachelors who cannot find brides. Numerically, there are just not enough women going around. And these are men, you know, farmers, who will not be able to get married. They call them guang guan, broken branches, that's the name in Chinese. They are the biological dead ends of their family. Now, 30 million men, that's about the population of Canada, so that's huge. You know, there's just no way you can import enough women in to meet that huge demand. GROSS: So is there an estimate of how many female fetuses were aborted that ended up in this kind of imbalance? Because, you know, you write that there was a policy that the health care worker couldn't tell the woman who was having a sonogram or whatever what the gender of the baby was, but that a lot of health care workers managed to give a clue anyway. So did women have ways of finding out and then choose to abort the females? FONG: Yeah. In the beginning, right - when the policy came around in 1980, at that time, they did not have scanning machines that could determine the gender of the fetus at an early stage. So people who delivered girls, for example, and wanted to keep their quota for that one boy, because if you used up your quota for a girl and then you gave birth to another girl, then you would lose that. So people would either abandon your daughters, or there would be infanticide, or they would give them away, which is part of the reason why we saw so many adoptions of China's babies, mostly girls, in the West. But later on, in the 1990s, technology made it easier for people to do all these scans. Companies like General Electric, you know, made these scanning machines that were portable and small enough that you could go from village to village. And you could determine the sex or the gender of your fetus for as little as $10 or $20. So people would just have an abortion instead of carrying their child to full term. So as a result of that, I think the Nobel economist Amartya Sen estimated there were about 100 million missing women - women that were never born or killed or aborted across Asia. Later, estimates kind of bore fruit that those figures were roughly about 100, 120 million. And out of that, about 50 or 60 million would have been women in China, so that's what's missing. GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is journalist Mei Fong. Her new book is called \"One Child\", and it's about the one-child policy in China, which was the policy from 1980 until the end of last year. Mei, let's take a short break here and then we'll talk some more about the one-child policy in China and what it's meant for men and women, for families and for the country as a whole. We'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GROSS: This is FRESH AIR, and if you're just joining us, my guest is Mei Fong. She's the author of the new book, \"One Child,\" and it's the story of China's one-child policy, which applied to many but not all of Chinese families. As she says, it was a basket of rules regulating how many children families were allowed to have and in what circumstances. The policy lasted from 1980 to 2015. Now there's a two-child policy, which means there's still a lot of regulations determining who's aloud to have children and how many. Her new book is called \"One Child. \" She's a Pulitzer prize-winning reporter - former reporter for The Wall Street Journal. Let's talk about how the one-child policy was enforced. So if a couple had one child and was not supposed to have a second, say the woman got pregnant - then what? FONG: Well, if she lived in a small village, for example, she would probably be scrutinized by a group. She would probably be grouped together with a set of households and come under what they call a cluster leader, somebody who sort of monitors the progress and fertility rights of a certain set of households. So, I met one cluster leader, for example, who used to keep a board where she would write down, you know, when women in her 10 households would have their periods, what kind of contraceptives they use, how many children they had - so on and so forth - she would have to track. So if this woman, for example, fell pregnant, then most likely this cluster leader would know about it very quickly. And then she would report to higher-up, and then the screws would come in, you know. Probably at first, a village leader would show on her doorstep and say look, you know, you know very well you shouldn't have this. You could have all sorts of problems with this. You might have to pay a fine. I've met enforcers who have gone to these houses and say, well, we used to take away something valuable to show that we mean business. If the couple. . . GROSS: Take away something valuable to show we mean - what does that mean? FONG: Well, like a television set, for example - or a pig. Or sometimes, if the household was a very poor household, they would take away homespun cloth or grain or something - you know, something that had to made it hurt, basically. And that was in a village setting, of course. In a city setting, it could maybe - if you worked for a civil servant - you know, service-linked job, they might, you know, threaten to fire you. GROSS: And this was for having a child or for just being pregnant? FONG: This was having a child. If you went for a termination, all this would go away. But of course, then there were people who really wanted the child. And then they would try and evade the whole process of being taken away for a forced abortion because here's the thing. Between your conception and delivery date, you know, all bets are off. They can make you - you know, remove the impediment. GROSS: Yeah, that's what I was wondering. Do they come and threaten you and take your TV and say, you'll only get this back if you have an abortion? Or do they just, like, take you to the abortion clinic and give you the abortion? FONG: I think it starts at sort of a level of persuasion. So they say, think about it. We'll come back tomorrow. Or, you know, we've got this tractor taking everybody to the - or this truck that will be taking everybody to the clinic on this date. You show up on this date, and you'll be fine. And if you miss that date, they'd come back again and threaten. And then, you know, and then so on and so forth. And so it becomes a matter of a hide-and-seek process for some people who desperately want to keep their child. So - and they hope to carry it to full term and then deliver it as a complee (ph). And then, of course, even though they are are still hit with fines, the child's living. It's born. It's there. But the problem becomes when it's still in the mother's stomach because then it's still - then it's still considered fair game for a lot of family planning officials. Theoretically speaking, forced abortions are illegal after the sixth month. But in practice, it happened. It happened as late as 2012, where there was a case of a woman, Feng Jianmei, who was - she was a rural (ph) woman. And she believed, and she wanted very much to have a second child. And they told her she couldn't. And they kept coming at her and saying, all right, if you're going to have the second child, you're going to have to pay something like 6,000 U. S. dollars. She and her husband worked in factories. They couldn't afford it. They tried to sort of see if they could pay less. And it went back and forth until she was in her seventh month, when they took her away to the hospital with a pillow case over her head and injected her with something that caused her to abort the 7-month fetus. GROSS: You talked with some of the people who had to enforce the one-child policy and either lead people to abortions or fine them for becoming pregnant after already having had a child. Tell us one of the stories you were told by one of the enforcers, or the population police, as you call them. FONG: There was a woman, and I tracked her down. Her name was Gao Xiaoduan (ph). And she's now living in America. She had been responsible for something like 1,500 abortions, out of which about a third were late-term abortions. And she had testified before Congress that she had worked as a mid-level family planning official in the southern China. And she gave a whole wealth of detail, basically, about, you know, what was the whole - how the business was conducted and how coercion was employed. You know, and one of the things she talked about was, you know, jails - you know, black (ph) jails that they would have. Basically, one of the ways in which you would persuade people to show up for an abortion would be to put a relative of theirs - you know, typically a mother, she would say - into the jail. I've seen these pictures of these cells, by the way. They just look like steel-bar cells. And she would say, OK, your mother's in jail. And she's going to stay there until you show up and come for an abortion. And so - you know, this is kind of the pressure or tactic employed too. And by the way, that period where they put, you know, that relative in jail, they would also charge that relative every day for, you know, a certain amount for food and so on. So, you know, a lot of people who would feel, you know, at some point bound to show up. And it wasn't necessarily just for abortions. It would also be for sterilizations too. You know, you say, OK, you know, your mother's going to be in jail until you show up for that sterilization operation. GROSS: Let's talk about how this policy, the one-child policy, has affected women in China. On the one hand, a lot of female fetuses were aborted because if you're only allowed to have one child, in China you're more likely to want that child to be a boy rather than a girl. But on the opposite side, you write that women in China, after the one-child policy, were more likely to get adequate food, education, jobs, opportunities than ever before in Chinese history. Why is that? FONG: Well, let's say you were born after 1980 in a big city. Chances are, you probably don't have a sibling. And if you're a girl and you don't have a sibling, then you don't have to fight with your sibling for resources. So, you know, your parents will want to send you to college. They won't be able to - they won't be debating a question of whether they should spend the money on your brother or yourself. It's all for you. So, you know - so imagine this scenario replicated, you know, a million times over. And the end result is, you know, women born - especially urban women - born after 1980 achieved way more than any other generation before them. GROSS: Are you saying, too, that your parents wouldn't automatically be favoring the brother over the daughter if there was no brother - if there was only a daughter? FONG: Yeah, no brother, nothing, right? Only a daughter - and not only that. I mean, if you're living in a city environment, then a daughter can just as equally earn money in a white-collar job as a son. You know, it's not a question of, you know, physical strength the way it is when you're on a farm, where boys count for more than girls because boys can lift and do more heavy farm work. So women, as a result, prospered. At least urban women did, a certain subsection of urban women. GROSS: My guest is Mei Fong, author of the new book, \"One Child: The Story Of China's Most Radical Experiment. \" After we take a short break, we'll talk about her personal connection to the story. Also, John Powers will review the new FX miniseries about the O. J. Simpson trial, and jazz critic Kevin Whitehead will play some of the earliest jazz recordings. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross back with Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Mei Fong. We're talking about her new book, \"One Child,\" which is about China's one child policy, which limited the number of children a married couple was allowed to have. The policy began in 1980. At the end of last year, it was revised to allow couples to have two children. As a result of the one child policy, China is now disproportionately old and male. Fong started the book when she was a Wall Street Journal reporter based in China. As part of her research, she spoke to parents and children whose lives were shaped by the one child policy. You spoke to a girl who wasn't, quote, \"registered\" because once you're born you have to be registered so that they know this couple, this family, has had their child. And the authorities know if somebody has to be sterilized, if they want to advise an abortion if there was another pregnancy. So this was a girl who wasn't registered. Why wasn't she registered? And what did it mean to not be registered? FONG: So a lot of things in China are tied to what you call your household registration. They call it the Hukou. So - what kind of jobs you can get, what kind of schooling you have, it's all tied to your Hukou, and where you get your Hukou begins right with the birth permit that your parents got when they were pregnant with you. So it all comes to that. So if you don't have a birth permit, it's very hard to get the Hukou. If you don't get the Hukou, it's very hard to get schooling, medical care. This girl that I spoke to, her name was Leesha (ph), she couldn't so much as get a library card or buy a train ticket because she didn't have a Hukou. And at the time when I spoke to her, she was in her 20s, she had never gone to school at all and she was living in Beijing. She wasn't living in some small town in the middle of nowhere. She was living in a very crowded metro city and she had never, ever been to school because she didn't have that. So they call this kind of an unregistered child a heihaizi, a black child, literally translated. And there are about thirteen million of these heihaizi, unregistered children, and some of them not necessarily children who are sort of nonentities. You know, you might call them undocumented migrant workers, you know, the context of what Westerners might understand because they don't have any rights. GROSS: In the social structure in China the way you describe it, parents as they age really rely on their children to help support them in old age. There isn't a social safety net in China. But now that there's been a one child policy in place since 1980, there's a lot of families where there's, like, one person, like, one child who has to support his or her aging parents who, you know, may be in failing health. And in most families now, there's not siblings to help a child support their parents, and so there's a lot of pressure on children now. How did you see that being manifested? FONG: When I was in China, starting from the mid-2000s, we used to have this thing they called the Little Emperors, right? This is a very common sight you would see in parks and restaurants - one cute little kid surrounded by a gaggle of adults, usually the parents, the two sets of grandparents, you know, all hustling around this one little kid. So that was what they called the xiao huangdi, the Little Emperor. But if you fast-forward, the first generation from the one child is now in their mid-30s so - and you have parents in the 50s or 60s, grandparents are 80s and 90s. So that balance is shifting so, you know, that child is now an adult, and an adult has to return back that care and love to a set of ailing adults, and without the benefit of any siblings to share that. I somehow think that sometimes having brothers or sisters is something probably we only really appreciate when we're much older, probably not when we're children. And, you know, if you'd at least look at the numbers alone, right, I mean, China has something like a quarter of the world's Parkinson's sufferers right now already, just by the sheer number of old people they have. In a matter of 20-something years, that percentage is actually going to jump up to something like 60-something percent, and, you know, all the numbers will be the same for Alzheimer's and dementia and all sorts of things like that. So it's a huge strain not necessarily just financially but emotionally as well. GROSS: So if you stand back and look at, like, you know, China as having had this, like, amazing economic boom, how much of that do you think is attributable to the population control that resulted from the one child policy? FONG: Two words for that - very little. I know that it's very hard for us to think that way because the one child policy basically happened at the same time when China opened up economically, and China for the last 30-something years has had double-digit GDP growth, therefore, ergo it must be connected, right? That is the line of thinking that's very popular. But here's the thing. I mean, basically when China opened up economically, what it did was it dropped all these socialist-planned economy stuff which wasn't working. They moved people from the country to the cities, they encouraged foreign investment and they did all these things which are so much more the reason why China's had this double-digit GDP growth, and it has really nothing to do with the one child policy. I mean, one of the main reasons why China grew so fast economically is because of this manufacturing boom they had, and a manufacturing boom is because of the cheap labor they had, and cheap labor is because of a lot of people, not fewer people. It's a result of the cohort that were born in the '60s and '70s before before the one child policy and were grown up and old enough to work in the factories at the time when China opened its doors. So really, you know, if you - I talked to a couple - quite a lot of economists about this, and, you know - many reasons for China's blistering economic growth, and very little of it has to do with the one child policy. GROSS: When you started writing your book, \"One Child,\" you were pregnant. And so here you were writing about all these, like, fertility issues and restrictions on, you know, families' rights to have more children, and you were trying to start a family of your own, but also while writing this book, you had a miscarriage. And also while writing this book, you had fertility issues because you have a hormonal disorder that affected your fertility. And so that gave you great insight, I think, into how really difficult it is for, you know, for a government to regulate a woman's fertility - because a woman's fertility, you know, you can prevent your body from conceiving, you can try to help it but some women will never conceive no matter matter how hard they try. You can't control biology that easily. FONG: Well, yeah, that's the whole point. I mean. . . GROSS: Oh, and then you can't turn it back on. You can't say, OK, women, now we need you to conceive because there's not enough young people so start conceiving. You know, biology doesn't always work that way. FONG: Yeah, you're right, write Terry. I mean, biology can be controlled only to a certain extent, fertility can only be controlled to a certain extent. Family life, the regulation of it, can only be controlled to a certain extent. At some point, we have to allow this space for personal choice and decision into that matter, and I think when we don't, these are the tragedies that occur and that's what I try to explore in the book with the stories of individual people. GROSS: Now, another interesting story related to your \"One Child\" book is your extended family's story. Your paternal grandfather had 18 sons. I'll say that again - 18 sons. And your father was the 16th of those sons. Then your father married your mother, she had five daughters, one of whom was you. FONG: Yes, I was the last one, the fifth one - the last hope for the son. GROSS: And your mother was considered kind of deficient by your father's family because all she had was daughters. They wanted sons. So what do you see when you look at your family history of sons and daughters and the favoring of sons over daughters? FONG: Well, I see the microcosm of what Chinese culture has brought forth. You know, I should make clear at this point, I'm ethnically Chinese but I'm not nationally Chinese. I am third-generation Chinese. My grandparents were from China. They migrated to Malaysia. So we're what you call Huaquiao, overseas Chinese, who are actually considered very traditional. We cling to the old ways a lot. So my family was very son-loving. GROSS: How did your father, coming from a culture and from a family that preferred sons over daughters, how did your father deal with having five daughters and no sons? FONG: He was a very disappointed man. You know, my father was not a farmer. He was - he worked in the civil service. He had been trained as an accountant, but you know, he still had all these notions in his head that his sons were really necessary and that they were important, to, you know - they made you a man, they made you somehow more relevant. And he used to rail at us all the time and say that you are nothing but liabilities, you are not assets, you are liabilities. And so we grew up, you know, very much feeling like second-class citizens as daughters, as Chinese daughters. GROSS: He didn't say that ironically, he really meant it? FONG: No, he really meant that, he really did. And then he had a stroke at 57 so, you know, he was very angry and very disappointed. GROSS: Was your mother disappointed by having five daughters? FONG: I mean, she loved us, but you know, you could feel it. And I was too young at the time to sort of see it, but, you know, at clan gatherings and stuff, there was always these slights, these things - and my grandmother was really nasty, too. My grandmother really loved boy cousins so every time we'd play, we learned to avoid her because she would always pinch us - the girls, you know, she really didn't like us. And this all sounds so feudalistic and something that would happen maybe a hundred years ago, but it wasn't that long ago at all. GROSS: So you are now the mother of twins. They're both boys (laughter). FONG: Yeah. I didn't do anything with the choosing of that, but I really wanted a girl. (Laughter). GROSS: Were you surprised to have twins? FONG: I wasn't because it was IVF, and here's the thing, right? The fertility issue - I was having trouble, and, you know, multiples are, you know, a very common result of IVF. And one of the things I discovered when I was having IVF in China were that there were quite a lot of women in the clinic I was going to who weren't going there necessarily because they were infertile but because they wanted multiples because this is one way to get around the one child policy. Twins or triplets are counted as a single birth so you will not have to pay the fines, you will not lose your job. And so it was kind of like a buy one, get one free kind of a concept. GROSS: Well, thank you so much for talking with us, I really appreciate it. FONG: Thanks Terry.

This is what Gen. Nicholson said about Afghanistan at his confirmation hearing last week in an exchange with Sen. John McCain. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JOHN MCCAIN: The security situation in Afghanistan has been deteriorating rather than improving. What is your assessment? JOHN MICK NICHOLSON: Sir, I agree with your assessment. MONTAGNE: And joining us is NPR's Tom Bowman, who's made numerous trips of his own to that country. Good morning. TOM BOWMAN, BYLINE: Good morning, Renee. MONTAGNE: Now the current commander of Afghanistan - that's Gen. John Campbell - he appears before the House Armed Services Committee today for an update. Do you think he'll agree about this deteriorating situation? BOWMAN: Well, Renee, I'm guessing he'll put a better face on things. Last fall, he told this committee it was a tough fighting season. He talked about a, quote, \"a tenuous security situation in Afghanistan\" and also what he called an uneven performance of the Afghan forces who are now leading the fight. Now, Gen. Campbell has been talking about options he provided to the president, and I'm told you could see among these options more U. S. airstrikes to push back the Taliban in key areas and also perhaps allowing U. S. Green Berets to work with Afghan forces on more occasions closer to the front lines. MONTAGNE: OK, well, troops, also - U. S. troops were supposed to drop from the current 10,000, as I was saying, to roughly 5,000 by the end of this year. That is the end of President Obama's time in office. Do you think that'll happen? BOWMAN: Well, you know, that seems less likely now with ISIS growing there and the Taliban, you know, surging forward. Gen. Nicholson, who will take over as the next commander, told senators that if U. S. troops dropped to 5,000, it'll be harder to help the Afghans fight the Taliban. Most of the American troops, of course, are working inside bases. So if you drop to 5,000 officials, say, you just won't have enough U. S. troops to get out in the field or provide the needed airstrikes, for example. But there's frustration on Capitol Hill and elsewhere, Renee. You know, when will this end? And military leaders say the Afghans still need help on things like logistics and supply, also building up an Air Force which could take, they say, five or six more years. MONTAGNE: Well, just briefly, what does ISIS add to this mix? BOWMAN: Well, ISIS adds, you know, another security problem. I'm told a lot of these Taliban fighters have switched jerseys, as they say, now fighting with ISIS. There are estimated one to 2,000 ISIS fighters in eastern Afghanistan, so it's adding to the problems. There's no question about it. The U. S. are using airstrikes to take out ISIS. But it's a growing problem, particularly in eastern Afghanistan, that they're going to have to deal with. MONTAGNE: All right, well, Tom, thanks very much. BOWMAN: You're welcome, Renee. MONTAGNE: That's NPR's Pentagon correspondent Tom Bowman.

There are estimated one to 2,000 ISIS fighters in eastern Afghanistan, so it's adding to the problems. There's no question about it. The U. S. are using airstrikes to take out ISIS. But it's a growing problem, particularly in eastern Afghanistan, that they're going to have to deal with. MONTAGNE: All right, well, Tom, thanks very much. BOWMAN: You're welcome, Renee.

I'm Terry Gross. My guest, Bassem Youssef, has often been called the Jon Stewart of Egypt and his show was known as \"The Daily Show\" of the Arab world. The comparison is no coincidence. Youssef modeled his show on \"The Daily Show,\" and as a result of his TV show's success, he's been a guest on \"The Daily Show. \" Youssef is a former heart surgeon. He provided medical care to protesters in Tahrir Square during the Egyptian Revolution. After the overthrow of President Hosni Mubarak, Youssef began producing a series of short political satire videos he hosted from his home and put up on YouTube. The Web series was so successful, he was offered his own TV show by the Egyptian network ONTV. That's when he gave up medicine. His TV show became the most popular TV series in Egypt's history. But Mohamed Morsi, who was elected president after Mubarak's fall, didn't appreciate being satirized. In 2013, Youssef was accused of insulting the president and insulting Islam. The prosecutor general issued a warrant for Youssef's arrest. He turned himself in and was interrogated for six hours before being released on bail. The incident prompted Jon Stewart to send this message to President Morsi in an episode of \"The Daily Show. \"(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"THE DAILY SHOW\")JON STEWART: But come on. Charging Bassem Youssef with insulting Egypt and Islam? I know Bassem. Bassem is my friend, my brother. There are two things he loves in this world with all of his heart - Egypt and Islam. And his family. There are three things. There's three. . . AUDIENCE: (Laughter). STEWART: And what is that flatbread with the cheese, it's tart? It's, like, a white - it's not baba ghanoush. It's, like, there's four things that he loves. AUDIENCE: (Laughter). STEWART: My point is, Bassem Youssef loves Egypt so much, he chooses to live there even though some crazy guy is threatening to arrest him. Oh, right. AUDIENCE: (Laughter). STEWART: By the way, without Bassem and all those journalists and bloggers and brave protesters who took to Tahrir Square to voice dissent, you, President Morsi, would not be a position to repress them. For someone who spent time in jail yourself. . . AUDIENCE: (APPLAUSE)STEWART: For someone who spent time in jail yourself under Mubarak, you seem awfully eager to send other people there for the same non-crimes. And just like you, they will only emerge from prison stronger and more determined. So all sending comedians and bloggers to prison accomplishes is lowering the quality of prison yard athletics. AUDIENCE: (LAUGHTER)GROSS: Youssef's case was eventually dismissed, and he returned to his TV show. But the leaders of the military coup that pushed out President Morsi didn't like being satirized, either. Youssef's show was terminated, and he got out of Egypt. He's been living in Dubai, but right now he's in the States working on a new series, titled, \"The Democracy Handbook\" that will premiere this spring on the Fusion channel's new digital platform, F-Comedy. On February 8, he'll speak at the New York Live Arts's Live Ideas festival presented in partnership with the Graduate Center of the City University of New York. The theme is Cultural Transformations in the Middle East North Africa Region. Bassem Youssef, welcome to FRESH AIR. Let's start with a description of the show that you hosted in Egypt. Since it's in Arabic, I think few Americans have actually seen it. BASSEM YOUSSEF: I thought Arabic was your first language. Well, my show in Egypt was called, \"The Show,\" or, \"Al Bernameg\" in Arabic. Basically it was a political satire show. It started on Internet by three, four-minute episodes and then it evolved into a live show in a theater, which was something that was unprecedented in the Arab world. And so that was the show. GROSS: Jon Stewart's show is pre-recorded but it's in front of a live audience. And you were the first show in the Middle East or in the Arab world to have a live audience. Was the government afraid of that? YOUSSEF: Now, at that time, you have to remember there was, like, a kind of hope and a window of free speech that so many people were allowed to create and be creative and do what they wanted. So at that time, the people was much stronger and we dictated what we wanted. Later, of course, it was - things got a little bit different and the pressures were much stronger. But at that time, no, the government didn't have a say of, like, what to allow and what not to allow. GROSS: Can you describe a segment that was on your show that got a really big audience reaction? YOUSSEF: When we were satirizing the government announcement that they have invented an AIDS machine, a machine that cures you from hepatitis C and AIDS. GROSS: Wait - can I interrupt? The government said that they had a machine that cured AIDS? YOUSSEF: Yes, yes. GROSS: What was this machine supposed to be? YOUSSEF: (Laughter). It looked like a mini dialysis machine where they actually said, like, we're going on cure your AIDS and we're going to cure your hepatitis C. It was a big thing in Egypt. I mean, if you look up, like, Egyptian AIDS machine, it was huge. And of course it was one of the most lucrative material that we had and that was very fun. People were actually waiting for me every week to mention something about the machine. And we did because they promised the people that in six months, the machine would be ready for mass consumption. And we were actually having a timer, a countdown timer to remind people that, you know, it's already three months now and we're waiting. And I think maybe this is one of the reasons why we were stopped because we were holding the people in power accountable for what they said. I mean, it is very depressing to see that in the 21st century people are still using the same 1950s and '60s style of propaganda. We have Internet now and people are not stupid. But it seems that some people are trying to push the same agenda of the Cold War of conspiracy theories and amazing achievements that are very easily traced and validated so. . . GROSS: So this was supposed to be an amazing achievement that would show how great your government was. YOUSSEF: Yes. GROSS: OK. So what happened in six months when they didn't produce the machine? YOUSSEF: Well, my show was pulled off the air before the six months. (Laughter). So the timer continued, but online with everybody else. So every year, we would celebrate the date for the never-existing AIDS machine. GROSS: That's great. OK, so you started your show after the Egyptian revolution that overthrew President Mubarak. And then under President Mohamed Morsi, who was elected after the revolution, he accused you of insulting the government - wait, I have a list here of the - well, you probably know it by heart, but I don't. . . YOUSSEF: Yeah, it was a big list. GROSS: You can recite it, yeah. YOUSSEF: Well, I was accused of insulting the president, insulting Islam, insulting - spreading rumors, disturbing the peace. But it was not him, just to be fair. I mean, the way that things happen in Egypt, the government - or the head of the government - don't get personally involved. They were always goonies and agents and people who do that kind of work for the government either by direct instructions or because they think that they're doing something good or they want to be on the good side of the government. It is about creating an atmosphere where you hold people or like accuse people of whatever crazy stuff because of what they say. And this happened during Morsi, before Morsi, after Morsi. It's still continuing. And that was ridiculous because now you're having a joker who is up against the government. And we are always at the risk of being accused of something. And I think by the time I left Egypt, there was about like 400 accusations against me in the drawer of the public persecutor office. It's a way for them to exhaust you, to push you, to put you under pressure, to distract you. And that's a very old style that we are known for in the Middle East. GROSS: Were you disappointed that the Arab Spring, the Egyptian revolution, didn't bring the kind of free speech that it stood in support of? That you still couldn't - that you still couldn't host a satirical show on television without getting detained and interrogated, which was one of the things that happened to you. YOUSSEF: Well, detained and interrogated is the one of the least things that happened. I mean, afterwards we were - the signal was jammed a couple of times. We were banned a couple of times. I lost my show when I had to leave the country. So, yes, the disappointment is big. But, like, I want to look at the bigger picture. When we overthrew Mubarak, we did this in 18 days. And because we were very naive and very unexperienced in revolutions, we thought that that was it. It is very difficult to imagine that you can actually get rid of a dictatorship that has been there for 60 years only in 18 days. So we were very naive. We thought that that was it and that we were ready. And - but if you have like a very brief look to what happened in the world and the history of revolutions, it never takes 18 days. It takes decades. And I always tell people that a revolution is not an event, it's a process. It is a struggle. And it doesn't usually go smoothly. GROSS: So at editorial meetings for your show, did you sit around with the writers and think, well - and talk about, OK, if we say this, this will be really funny. It also might get the show pulled off the air. If we say that, that could be really funny, and we might all be put in prison for it. So what kind of calculus did you do with that? YOUSSEF: We had this all the time. It's like we crack the funniest jokes ever. But, you know - and I'm sure it happens everywhere. I mean, I'm sure even in America, where you have, like, free speech people self-censor themself. And it's not - it happens because of different reasons. Because maybe it's politically incorrect, it doesn't have to really to be put in jail. So people here kind of bend down for the pressure - the public pressure. Back in Egypt, we had both. We had the public pressure and we had the problem of getting in trouble. So, yes, we would actually joke about, like, ah, this is the joke that's going to close the show. That's the one that's going to end it. And, yeah, sometimes we had really funny jokes. But we couldn't put everything. We had to be very careful. But it seems that it was not about, like, the quality of the jokes or, like, how offensive or how strong the joke is because I think the show was, at a certain point, destined to be pulled off the air any time. So we were - I think we were betting when was the show would be stopped? And eventually somebody won the bet. GROSS: Let me reintroduce you. If you're just joining us, my guest is Bassem Youssef, who became known in the U. S. as the Jon Stewart of the Arab world after the Egyptian revolution when he hosted a satirical news show in Egypt inspired by \"The Daily Show. \" That show was basically forced off the air in 2014 because he satirized the government. Let's take a short break, then we'll talk some more. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is Bassem Youssef, who became known here as the Jon Stewart of the Arab world after the Egyptian revolution when he hosted a satirical news show inspired by \"The Daily Show. \" But then Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi accused him of insulting the president and insulting religion. And then the military regime replaced Morsi. They didn't like being satirized either. This all led to the demise of his show in 2014. And he's since signed a deal to create a satirical show in the U. S. that will be on the Internet and will premiere in April. We'll talk about that a little bit later. So when you were detained and interrogated in Egypt, one of the things they did is play clips from your show and ask you about that. What did they need to know from the clips? I mean (laughter) what did they want to know from you? It's - like, you're not a CIA agent. You don't have access to, like, intelligence. You're a surgeon who became a satirist, so why were they playing your clips? What kind of questions did they ask you? YOUSSEF: Well, first of all, about the CIA agent, I have a joke for you about that, but let me tell you first about the interrogation. So because I was facing things like insulting the president, insulting Islam, insulting whatever, they would actually play the clips for me to see if I've actually insulted. And they would actually play it for me and they asked me what did you mean by that? I said, like, well, it's a joke. And they said, like, well, yeah, what did you mean? Are you satirizing the president? And I was like, no, I'm just saying it as it is. And they're like, why are the people laughing? I was like, well, you know, you should ask them. And the worst thing ever that you have to explain your joke because I was very disappointed trying to explain why the joke is funny (laughter) for the interrogator. So he would ask me why - why they - why are they laughing? I said, like, well, they are laughing because of this (laughter). But let me get back to the CIA thing. . . GROSS: Yes. YOUSSEF: . . . Because this is one of the conspiracy theories that was actually used against me. They actually - people went out there and they wrote articles and went on television shows saying that I am an operative that the CIA who used Jon Stewart to recruit me. So Jon Stewart, who actually - a guy from America was used by the CIA in order to recruit me for the CIA and be - make me a CIA agent to use sarcasm to bring down the government and bring down the country because this was all, of course, part of a worldwide conspiracy against the country. GROSS: And this was clearly because Jon Stewart proved so successful in ending Fox News, which he criticized all the time. And he succeeded. It doesn't exist anymore, so he was teaching you how to overthrow the government. YOUSSEF: Yes, yes, yes, I - he is the grand master and I am his (laughter) his follower. GROSS: That is so far-fetched. YOUSSEF: I mean, we are actually - I mean, we're laughing about this but seriously there are people who believe in Egypt that I - I'm actually - I'm getting paid by external powers and external intelligence entities in order to use satire to bring down the government. And it was believed by people from both sides. This was said about me during the Islamist era. This was said about me during the military era. And this sense of paranoia was very, very strong. I'm not saying that everybody said that, but it was the people who used that in order to discredit me. And you'll always find people to believe that. And if you think that this is far-fetched, well, we can talk about the conspiracy theories in America. GROSS: Absolutely. YOUSSEF: The only thing is that - the only difference is that the government doesn't move in order to arrest someone based on a conspiracy theory. Or it doesn't, like, shut someone's show because of a conspiracy theory. You know, so you can compare these people who believe that, like, we need to end the war because of the rapture. So (laughter) we can - you can choose your own poison. GROSS: The thing is when people believe a conspiracy that is not rooted in reality at all, facts don't seem to sway them in any way, so. . . YOUSSEF: It doesn't matter. Facts doesn't matter. GROSS: Yeah. YOUSSEF: And here's my biggest issue with this - people would believe, propagate, spread rumors or conspiracy theories in order to protect their own system of denial. So because if you are living - the only the way that you can live and function without seeing the facts in front of you is to put yourself in a constant state of denial. So it's not because the system is a failure. No, it's because you guys want to bring down the system. And it happens whether you are on the religious right or you are on the military right. So you will actually form your own system of denial in order to keep believing in what you're believing and anybody who's trying to tell you the truth is part of this conspiracy. It doesn't matter if the truth is right there out in front of your eyes. You will find a way, a mechanism, in order to keep your own system of denial. So as I always say it, denial is a river that runs in the - in Egypt. So we became very good in that. GROSS: When you were detained, Jon Stewart in the U. S. on \"The Daily Show\" did kind of a commentary about that, about how he was your friend and he didn't realize he was consorting with a criminal. And he quoted some of the things that Morsi had said about your show, charging you with, you know, insulting the president and insulting Islam. Then he showed a clip of Mohamed Morsi - of President Morsi - telling people to - these were older clips - telling people to nurse their children on hatred of Zionism and a clip of Morsi calling Zionists bloodsuckers descended from apes and pigs, so an example of him doing exactly what he charged you with doing, which is insulting religion. So as I watched that when it was happening I was wondering was that going to help you or hurt you because he is clearly expressing his - his deep connection with you, his deep friendship with you and his, you know, solidarity with you. At the same time, if it got back to President Morsi that Jon Stewart was satirizing Morsi on your behalf, I don't think President Morsi would've liked it very much. So did that have any impact, do you know, and did you think it was a good thing or a bad thing that he was doing that? YOUSSEF: Well, we have to look at this in context. At that time, although the Islamist regime was trying to get its own way in government but they were not strong enough to stop a program or, like - they tried but they couldn't because the people were against him. They kind of alienated the people in Egypt and it was difficult for them to operate through that. So here's, like, a paradox I'm going to tell you. So when Jon Stewart came to my defense, the anti-Islamist regime hailed that and, you know, said, like, this is amazing. You see, like, we shouldn't crack down on free speech, and you Islamist guys are, like, facists and whatever. When Jon Stewart came to my defense after Morsi - because I did the same thing with the regime that followed Morsi - the same people who hailed the move for Jon Stewart, they actually believed in the same conspiracy theories that the Islamists were propagating. And so, like, oh, you are asking for support from the West and from people who want to bring us down. It is very - it was a very, very interesting process to see the same people who stood next to you now because you are criticizing the regime that they support that they would use the same kind of lies and conspiracy theories that was used by the people against them. And I think that the religious and the military right wings are just two sides of the same coin if somebody uses God and religion and somebody uses country and security. And the people who hailed the support from outside just used that against me afterwards, which is very funny. GROSS: My guest is Bassem Youssef. His Egyptian TV series of political satire was modeled on \"The Daily Show. \" It was attacked by the government and was terminated in 2014. We'll talk more after we take a short break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross back with Bassem Youssef, who's become known in the U. S. as the Jon Stewart of Egypt. Youssef is a heart surgeon who gave up medicine to start a show of political satire in Egypt after the revolution overthrew President Hosni Mubarak. But even after the revolution, it was risky to satirize the government and Islam. Youssef's show was attacked by the government. The show was terminated in 2014 and he left the country. He recently moved to California and is working on a new satirical web series about American democracy that will premiere in the spring on the Fusion channel's new digital platform. What was Egyptian TV like when you started your show? YOUSSEF: A little bit, like, you know, locked in the '80s. We had, like, talk shows that went for hours. And the only popular shows were the ones that was imported, like franchised. Like we had our own \"Arab Idol,\" our own \"The Voice\". So these were the popular ones - entertainment, light entertainment, drama series and talk shows that went for hours. To have this kind of show, it was totally different. And it was a revolution. And maybe we are off the air now, but I'm very happy to see that people now are trying to replicate the kind of show that I was doing, but of course with a much lower ceiling. GROSS: What kind of comedy did you grow up with? Did you grow up with comedy? YOUSSEF: Yeah, of course. I mean, everybody grows up with comedy. I mean, Egyptian comedy has a very, very old tradition. Our theater and our movies are just, like, amazing. And Egypt is kind of like the Hollywood of the Middle East. I mean, we had cinema maybe decades before the other Arab countries ever got independence. So we had - of course, we grew up with the Egyptian comedy and of course with a lot of American comedy. I watched, you know, the sitcoms - the \"Friends,\" \"Frasier,\" all of that, you know, lovely American culture - and with the American movies as well as the Egyptian movies. GROSS: So you made the switch to satire after becoming a successful heart surgeon. And you were in Tahrir Square treating injured protesters during the Egyptian revolution. How did you decide that that's where you wanted to be at that moment? YOUSSEF: Well, at that moment, I didn't really plan ahead. At that moment, there was two things on my mind - first of all, what's going to happen in this revolution? And second, I had my papers - I was waiting for my papers from Cleveland where I was accepted in a pediatric heart surgery hospital. GROSS: Yeah, you had been accepted at the Rainbow Babies and Children's Hospital. . . YOUSSEF: Yes. GROSS: . . . Which is affiliated with Case Western Reserve University. And this was. . . YOUSSEF: Very good. Very good (laughter). GROSS: So you'd already spent, like, seven years in medical school, 12 years training in heart surgery. YOUSSEF: Yes. GROSS: You had this - what? - a fellowship in Cleveland at this hospital, which is a pretty big deal. YOUSSEF: Yeah, the papers were, like, you know - they were a little bit delayed with the lawyers and stuff. And I was waiting for it, so I would apply for my H-1 visa at that time. And, you know, after the revolution ended, the 18 days, I started to show in the Internet because during the 18 days I would go to the Square and I'd see the people. I would treat the people. I would go back home and I see the lies and deceit and the brainwashing on television. I said, like, you know what? This is not right. GROSS: Wait, let me stop you again. Give me an example of what you saw when you were working as a doctor treating wounded protesters in Tahrir Square during the Egyptian revolution and what you heard reported on television news. Give us an example of contrast. YOUSSEF: So what I saw day-to-day is like people who are actually asking for freedom, calling for freedom - protesting, singing, chanting, calling for the removal of the regime - plain and simple. And of course there were clashes there because people, they tried to remove those protesters from Tahrir. And I was, like, doing my job as a doctor treating them. So that's what I saw in real life. When you go back home, this is what you saw in Egyptian media. You saw all of these people calling and reporting ridiculous reports about those are operatives, those are spies, they are paid 50 euros and one bucket of the KFC dinner box in order to be there. So they were talking about how these people - operatives of the CIA, the Mossad, the Hezbollah, Hamas, Iran, Qatar - all at the same time. You would see reports about how America has infiltrated these people and they're sending their own spies in order to lead the revolution. So you would have people going out on television asking for bombing Tahrir Square or putting them under siege until they are die out of hunger. You had people, like, interviewing people with, quote, unquote, \"inside information about this is all a conspiracy from America and these are all spies. \" And so I had so many - so I said, this is not what I saw. This is all propaganda. So, like, just to kind of summarize it in one sentence - imagine Fox News but everywhere and more crazy and more non-credible. This is what we had. So I decided, like, you know, I want to do this. And I really didn't expect that people would watch my show. At that time, by the way, just to mention, there was no - absolutely no original Arabic content on YouTube. So I was actually the first one to go out with his face on the Internet and talk about stuff to people through YouTube. GROSS: I'm shocked to hear that. Why weren't there - was that because of government restrictions, or? YOUSSEF: No, there was, like - it was something that is not known in Egypt, you know? You may have to remember, it's 2008 - 2011 sorry. So maybe, like, two, three years this was - even YouTube was still, like, you know, becoming big in the States. It was not as common as it is now. People didn't know that, oh, we have - we can have actually a third window other than, like, radio and television. So I start to do this, and I said, look, maybe I'll have 10,000 views - that will be nice. You know, something - I'm, you know, I'm spending my time until my papers come from Cleveland. And suddenly, in two months, I have five million views and it is the show that everybody's talking about in Egypt. GROSS: So let's talk a little bit about growing up in Egypt. Your father, who I think died pretty recently after an auto accident - I'm very sorry that you lost him. Was that very recent? YOUSSEF: Yeah, that was eight, nine months ago, and yeah, my mom also died, like, a year and a half ago. But - so yes, I lost both of my parents. GROSS: Your father had been a judge in Egypt, and for a while, he was the head of the administrative court of the state council. What was that? I don't know what that means. YOUSSEF: It's basically he was the head of the court that would judge in disputes between the government - between government entities and each other. GROSS: OK, that's kind of a complicated position when you're working with a dictatorship, right? YOUSSEF: Yeah, but for a very long time, the judiciary was very independent. And my father maybe enjoyed one of the last days when he actually was independent, and he ruled a lot against the government. And because that, he was actually put into early retirement. So in a way, he was a revolutionary in his own self. He had a very impressive track record and how he - especially during Mubarak because he actually ruled to overrule many of the election results during the 2000 elections during Mubarak, the parliament elections. And he has a very, very impressive and pristine track record which I'm very proud of. GROSS: So what was it like for you growing up with a father who ruled against the government - controversial rulings? He was forced into early retirement as a result. Did it make you feel like to be defiant was great? Were you afraid of the consequences he and the family might face? YOUSSEF: Well, here's the thing. I can tell you something about both of my parents. My mom has also had her struggles because the wife of the prime minister at that time during Mubarak was in her same department. She was a professor of business administration, and she also stood against her and the government. So I come from a family who have revolted against the government in their own way. However, when I was on the show, they were always asking me to hold back because it's different when it's your son out there. As a matter of fact, they did not approve of many of my revolutionary messages, and they said, like - maybe it's different because they were getting older and they didn't want any trouble. But it was very interesting to see that during their own career lives they didn't shut up and they didn't stop and they didn't hold back, but when it has to come to their son, they were very protective. GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is Bassem Youssef, who became known as the Jon Stewart of the Arab world after the Egyptian Revolution when he hosted a satirical news show in Egypt, a show inspired by \"The Daily Show. \" Let's take a short break then we'll talk some more. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is Bassem Youssef, who became known here as the Jon Stewart of the Arab world after the Egyptian revolution when he started hosting a satirical news show inspired by \"The Daily Show. \" But the then-Egyptian president, Mohamed Morsi, accused him of insulting the president and insulting religion. And that, and other things, led to the demise of the show in 2014 and to Youssef being detained and interrogated. He has now signed a deal to create a show for the American cable channel Fusion TV - an American satirical web series in April that's going to satirize American democracy. So you've been in the states for about a month. And I imagine you've been watching the coverage of the presidential campaigns and the lead up to the Iowa caucuses, the speeches, the night of the Iowa caucuses. So I'm so interested in your impressions. And I suppose we should start with Donald Trump saying - though he said this before you came, but I'm sure you're aware of it - that, you know, that the United States should not allow Muslims into the country. YOUSSEF: Well, I think Donald Trump trade is just to offend everybody and see how it works. And I think - I don't care about Donald Trump himself. I care and I worry about the very big base that supports him because this kind of language would have been absolutely nonexistent maybe 15, 20 - by the way, I follow the American elections, and I have never seen someone who is that offensive. I have seen people who are stupid. But stupid and offensive, that's new. And the problem is the rising amount of support that this kind of narrative is gaining in the United States is what worries me. It's not what - who says it. And these people are using the fear. And they're using the hate. And they ride on that. And you have a lot of people supporting it. I mean, who would know - who would've - like, if you mention this 16 years later, you would think that George W. Bush is sane and he is, yes, a little bit of a brain compared to what's happening now. But the thing is Donald Trump is not stupid. He knows exactly what he's saying. And he's just saying out there - I mean, forget about Muslims. He said I could go down on Fifth Avenue in New York and shoot someone in the face and people - and the voters will have no problem with it. This transcends any kind of religion and any kind of belief. This is actually an offense and attack on human values. He's just saying out there I will shoot people in the face and people wouldn't care. GROSS: On the day of the Iowa caucuses, Donald Trump said that he'd been told by people in his security that there were people with tomatoes ready to throw tomatoes at him when he spoke. So he told his audience, if you see somebody with tomatoes, knock the crap out of them and don't worry about lawsuits because he would pay the legal fees. YOUSSEF: Yeah. GROSS: Did you hear that or read that? And I wonder what went through your mind. YOUSSEF: Well, this is a demagogue. I mean, this guy, if he was dressed into some sort of a military attire and he is from the Middle East, I mean, he would just, like, fit right in if you changed the language. This kind of, like, using the people, galvanizing the people in order to do hateful stuff, physical stuff and it's like, don't worry, you're protected, is absolutely no difference from what's happening in the rest of world dictatorships. And, I mean, let's call things as they are. He is a fear monger, and he is a racist and a bigot - as simple as that. GROSS: So you've been living in Dubai, right? YOUSSEF: Yes, for a year after I left Egypt. GROSS: How did you choose Dubai? YOUSSEF: Well, a number of things - it was closer and the producer of my show, who actually fled Egypt before me because they arrested his father and brother, went to Dubai, so there was already a set up there. So for me, it was a good transitional, like, zone area to be there before I moved to the states. GROSS: That's terrifying. They arrested his father and brother as a way of sending him a message? YOUSSEF: Well, I mean, we have some sort of a Greek tragedy because he was the producer of my show, and his father and brother was members of the Muslim brotherhood. So it doesn't really matter if you were. . . GROSS: Oh, I see. YOUSSEF: . . . If you were involved in terrorist attack. Just being in that group is enough to actually arrest you. So I don't - because, like, I know for a fact that his father was at home. He didn't participate in anything. And the fact that they have actually arrested him on the night of my comeback and making fun of the present regime sends you a message. So at that time, he was on a business trip in Dubai, and he never came back when he saw his father being arrested. GROSS: And did seeing that help inspire you to leave? YOUSSEF: No, it took me another year. And I continued with my show for another season until I was shut down. I didn't actually leave until they went to, like, a court of law in order to get an arbitration case against me. It was a sham verdict, of course. It was strange. It's a little bit complicated. My - the TV channel that was hosting my show ended my show. And we went to court. And they actually asked for a compensation. And they got it for 15 million dollars, which is crazy, right? Because they are the one who actually shut down my show. So, like, when that verdict came out, I knew that - they knew that I don't have 15 million dollars. They knew that I can't pay that. So I knew that they will use this in order to ban me from traveling or put me in jail, so I escaped. GROSS: You escaped? YOUSSEF: Yes, I did. GROSS: So you weren't able to just kind of, like, leave normally? You had to escape? YOUSSEF: No, I mean, like, I got on a plane just four hours after the verdict because I don't know how that play out. GROSS: Right, right. YOUSSEF: And maybe, looking back, I think this was the right decision to do. GROSS: How nervous were you that you wouldn't make it out? YOUSSEF: I was very nervous. And I was very nervous, and I was very worried about what will happen. But thank God I was not stopped in the airport. But the minute I landed the other side, I opened Twitter and social media, and the news of the verdict was all over the place. So, yeah, maybe we kind of, like, had a very, very, very, like, close break. GROSS: So I wish you all success in the U. S. YOUSSEF: Thank you. GROSS: Will you be moving here? YOUSSEF: Yeah, I'm already living in northern California in the East Bay, where it's very nice and pleasant. And it's a beautiful state to be in. GROSS: Well, I wish you the best. I will be looking for you and looking for your web series when it starts. YOUSSEF: Yes. GROSS: Thank you so much and be well. And thank you so much for doing this interview. YOUSSEF: Thank you so much. GROSS: Bassem Youssef will speak at the New York Live Arts - Live Ideas festival on Feb. 8. His new satirical series, \"The Democracy Handbook,\" will premiere in the spring on the Fusion channel's new digital platform. Coming up, Milo Miles reviews a new album by alternative hip-hop artist Lizzo, who's recorded with Prince. That's after a break. This is FRESH AIR. TERRY GROSS, HOST:  This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. My guest, Bassem Youssef, has often been called the Jon Stewart of Egypt and his show was known as \"The Daily Show\" of the Arab world. The comparison is no coincidence. Youssef modeled his show on \"The Daily Show,\" and as a result of his TV show's success, he's been a guest on \"The Daily Show. \" Youssef is a former heart surgeon. He provided medical care to protesters in Tahrir Square during the Egyptian Revolution. After the overthrow of President Hosni Mubarak, Youssef began producing a series of short political satire videos he hosted from his home and put up on YouTube. The Web series was so successful, he was offered his own TV show by the Egyptian network ONTV. That's when he gave up medicine. His TV show became the most popular TV series in Egypt's history. But Mohamed Morsi, who was elected president after Mubarak's fall, didn't appreciate being satirized. In 2013, Youssef was accused of insulting the president and insulting Islam. The prosecutor general issued a warrant for Youssef's arrest. He turned himself in and was interrogated for six hours before being released on bail. The incident prompted Jon Stewart to send this message to President Morsi in an episode of \"The Daily Show. \" (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"THE DAILY SHOW\") JON STEWART: But come on. Charging Bassem Youssef with insulting Egypt and Islam? I know Bassem. Bassem is my friend, my brother. There are two things he loves in this world with all of his heart - Egypt and Islam. And his family. There are three things. There's three. . . AUDIENCE: (Laughter). STEWART: And what is that flatbread with the cheese, it's tart? It's, like, a white - it's not baba ghanoush. It's, like, there's four things that he loves. AUDIENCE: (Laughter). STEWART: My point is, Bassem Youssef loves Egypt so much, he chooses to live there even though some crazy guy is threatening to arrest him. Oh, right. AUDIENCE: (Laughter). STEWART: By the way, without Bassem and all those journalists and bloggers and brave protesters who took to Tahrir Square to voice dissent, you, President Morsi, would not be a position to repress them. For someone who spent time in jail yourself. . . AUDIENCE: (APPLAUSE) STEWART: For someone who spent time in jail yourself under Mubarak, you seem awfully eager to send other people there for the same non-crimes. And just like you, they will only emerge from prison stronger and more determined. So all sending comedians and bloggers to prison accomplishes is lowering the quality of prison yard athletics. AUDIENCE: (LAUGHTER) GROSS: Youssef's case was eventually dismissed, and he returned to his TV show. But the leaders of the military coup that pushed out President Morsi didn't like being satirized, either. Youssef's show was terminated, and he got out of Egypt. He's been living in Dubai, but right now he's in the States working on a new series, titled, \"The Democracy Handbook\" that will premiere this spring on the Fusion channel's new digital platform, F-Comedy. On February 8, he'll speak at the New York Live Arts's Live Ideas festival presented in partnership with the Graduate Center of the City University of New York. The theme is Cultural Transformations in the Middle East North Africa Region. Bassem Youssef, welcome to FRESH AIR. Let's start with a description of the show that you hosted in Egypt. Since it's in Arabic, I think few Americans have actually seen it. BASSEM YOUSSEF: I thought Arabic was your first language. Well, my show in Egypt was called, \"The Show,\" or, \"Al Bernameg\" in Arabic. Basically it was a political satire show. It started on Internet by three, four-minute episodes and then it evolved into a live show in a theater, which was something that was unprecedented in the Arab world. And so that was the show. GROSS: Jon Stewart's show is pre-recorded but it's in front of a live audience. And you were the first show in the Middle East or in the Arab world to have a live audience. Was the government afraid of that? YOUSSEF: Now, at that time, you have to remember there was, like, a kind of hope and a window of free speech that so many people were allowed to create and be creative and do what they wanted. So at that time, the people was much stronger and we dictated what we wanted. Later, of course, it was - things got a little bit different and the pressures were much stronger. But at that time, no, the government didn't have a say of, like, what to allow and what not to allow. GROSS: Can you describe a segment that was on your show that got a really big audience reaction? YOUSSEF: When we were satirizing the government announcement that they have invented an AIDS machine, a machine that cures you from hepatitis C and AIDS. GROSS: Wait - can I interrupt? The government said that they had a machine that cured AIDS? YOUSSEF: Yes, yes. GROSS: What was this machine supposed to be? YOUSSEF: (Laughter). It looked like a mini dialysis machine where they actually said, like, we're going on cure your AIDS and we're going to cure your hepatitis C. It was a big thing in Egypt. I mean, if you look up, like, Egyptian AIDS machine, it was huge. And of course it was one of the most lucrative material that we had and that was very fun. People were actually waiting for me every week to mention something about the machine. And we did because they promised the people that in six months, the machine would be ready for mass consumption. And we were actually having a timer, a countdown timer to remind people that, you know, it's already three months now and we're waiting. And I think maybe this is one of the reasons why we were stopped because we were holding the people in power accountable for what they said. I mean, it is very depressing to see that in the 21st century people are still using the same 1950s and '60s style of propaganda. We have Internet now and people are not stupid. But it seems that some people are trying to push the same agenda of the Cold War of conspiracy theories and amazing achievements that are very easily traced and validated so. . . GROSS: So this was supposed to be an amazing achievement that would show how great your government was. YOUSSEF: Yes. GROSS: OK. So what happened in six months when they didn't produce the machine? YOUSSEF: Well, my show was pulled off the air before the six months. (Laughter). So the timer continued, but online with everybody else. So every year, we would celebrate the date for the never-existing AIDS machine. GROSS: That's great. OK, so you started your show after the Egyptian revolution that overthrew President Mubarak. And then under President Mohamed Morsi, who was elected after the revolution, he accused you of insulting the government - wait, I have a list here of the - well, you probably know it by heart, but I don't. . . YOUSSEF: Yeah, it was a big list. GROSS: You can recite it, yeah. YOUSSEF: Well, I was accused of insulting the president, insulting Islam, insulting - spreading rumors, disturbing the peace. But it was not him, just to be fair. I mean, the way that things happen in Egypt, the government - or the head of the government - don't get personally involved. They were always goonies and agents and people who do that kind of work for the government either by direct instructions or because they think that they're doing something good or they want to be on the good side of the government. It is about creating an atmosphere where you hold people or like accuse people of whatever crazy stuff because of what they say. And this happened during Morsi, before Morsi, after Morsi. It's still continuing. And that was ridiculous because now you're having a joker who is up against the government. And we are always at the risk of being accused of something. And I think by the time I left Egypt, there was about like 400 accusations against me in the drawer of the public persecutor office. It's a way for them to exhaust you, to push you, to put you under pressure, to distract you. And that's a very old style that we are known for in the Middle East. GROSS: Were you disappointed that the Arab Spring, the Egyptian revolution, didn't bring the kind of free speech that it stood in support of? That you still couldn't - that you still couldn't host a satirical show on television without getting detained and interrogated, which was one of the things that happened to you. YOUSSEF: Well, detained and interrogated is the one of the least things that happened. I mean, afterwards we were - the signal was jammed a couple of times. We were banned a couple of times. I lost my show when I had to leave the country. So, yes, the disappointment is big. But, like, I want to look at the bigger picture. When we overthrew Mubarak, we did this in 18 days. And because we were very naive and very unexperienced in revolutions, we thought that that was it. It is very difficult to imagine that you can actually get rid of a dictatorship that has been there for 60 years only in 18 days. So we were very naive. We thought that that was it and that we were ready. And - but if you have like a very brief look to what happened in the world and the history of revolutions, it never takes 18 days. It takes decades. And I always tell people that a revolution is not an event, it's a process. It is a struggle. And it doesn't usually go smoothly. GROSS: So at editorial meetings for your show, did you sit around with the writers and think, well - and talk about, OK, if we say this, this will be really funny. It also might get the show pulled off the air. If we say that, that could be really funny, and we might all be put in prison for it. So what kind of calculus did you do with that? YOUSSEF: We had this all the time. It's like we crack the funniest jokes ever. But, you know - and I'm sure it happens everywhere. I mean, I'm sure even in America, where you have, like, free speech people self-censor themself. And it's not - it happens because of different reasons. Because maybe it's politically incorrect, it doesn't have to really to be put in jail. So people here kind of bend down for the pressure - the public pressure. Back in Egypt, we had both. We had the public pressure and we had the problem of getting in trouble. So, yes, we would actually joke about, like, ah, this is the joke that's going to close the show. That's the one that's going to end it. And, yeah, sometimes we had really funny jokes. But we couldn't put everything. We had to be very careful. But it seems that it was not about, like, the quality of the jokes or, like, how offensive or how strong the joke is because I think the show was, at a certain point, destined to be pulled off the air any time. So we were - I think we were betting when was the show would be stopped? And eventually somebody won the bet. GROSS: Let me reintroduce you. If you're just joining us, my guest is Bassem Youssef, who became known in the U. S. as the Jon Stewart of the Arab world after the Egyptian revolution when he hosted a satirical news show in Egypt inspired by \"The Daily Show. \" That show was basically forced off the air in 2014 because he satirized the government. Let's take a short break, then we'll talk some more. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is Bassem Youssef, who became known here as the Jon Stewart of the Arab world after the Egyptian revolution when he hosted a satirical news show inspired by \"The Daily Show. \" But then Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi accused him of insulting the president and insulting religion. And then the military regime replaced Morsi. They didn't like being satirized either. This all led to the demise of his show in 2014. And he's since signed a deal to create a satirical show in the U. S. that will be on the Internet and will premiere in April. We'll talk about that a little bit later. So when you were detained and interrogated in Egypt, one of the things they did is play clips from your show and ask you about that. What did they need to know from the clips? I mean (laughter) what did they want to know from you? It's - like, you're not a CIA agent. You don't have access to, like, intelligence. You're a surgeon who became a satirist, so why were they playing your clips? What kind of questions did they ask you? YOUSSEF: Well, first of all, about the CIA agent, I have a joke for you about that, but let me tell you first about the interrogation. So because I was facing things like insulting the president, insulting Islam, insulting whatever, they would actually play the clips for me to see if I've actually insulted. And they would actually play it for me and they asked me what did you mean by that? I said, like, well, it's a joke. And they said, like, well, yeah, what did you mean? Are you satirizing the president? And I was like, no, I'm just saying it as it is. And they're like, why are the people laughing? I was like, well, you know, you should ask them. And the worst thing ever that you have to explain your joke because I was very disappointed trying to explain why the joke is funny (laughter) for the interrogator. So he would ask me why - why they - why are they laughing? I said, like, well, they are laughing because of this (laughter). But let me get back to the CIA thing. . . GROSS: Yes. YOUSSEF: . . . Because this is one of the conspiracy theories that was actually used against me. They actually - people went out there and they wrote articles and went on television shows saying that I am an operative that the CIA who used Jon Stewart to recruit me. So Jon Stewart, who actually - a guy from America was used by the CIA in order to recruit me for the CIA and be - make me a CIA agent to use sarcasm to bring down the government and bring down the country because this was all, of course, part of a worldwide conspiracy against the country. GROSS: And this was clearly because Jon Stewart proved so successful in ending Fox News, which he criticized all the time. And he succeeded. It doesn't exist anymore, so he was teaching you how to overthrow the government. YOUSSEF: Yes, yes, yes, I - he is the grand master and I am his (laughter) his follower. GROSS: That is so far-fetched. YOUSSEF: I mean, we are actually - I mean, we're laughing about this but seriously there are people who believe in Egypt that I - I'm actually - I'm getting paid by external powers and external intelligence entities in order to use satire to bring down the government. And it was believed by people from both sides. This was said about me during the Islamist era. This was said about me during the military era. And this sense of paranoia was very, very strong. I'm not saying that everybody said that, but it was the people who used that in order to discredit me. And you'll always find people to believe that. And if you think that this is far-fetched, well, we can talk about the conspiracy theories in America. GROSS: Absolutely. YOUSSEF: The only thing is that - the only difference is that the government doesn't move in order to arrest someone based on a conspiracy theory. Or it doesn't, like, shut someone's show because of a conspiracy theory. You know, so you can compare these people who believe that, like, we need to end the war because of the rapture. So (laughter) we can - you can choose your own poison. GROSS: The thing is when people believe a conspiracy that is not rooted in reality at all, facts don't seem to sway them in any way, so. . . YOUSSEF: It doesn't matter. Facts doesn't matter. GROSS: Yeah. YOUSSEF: And here's my biggest issue with this - people would believe, propagate, spread rumors or conspiracy theories in order to protect their own system of denial. So because if you are living - the only the way that you can live and function without seeing the facts in front of you is to put yourself in a constant state of denial. So it's not because the system is a failure. No, it's because you guys want to bring down the system. And it happens whether you are on the religious right or you are on the military right. So you will actually form your own system of denial in order to keep believing in what you're believing and anybody who's trying to tell you the truth is part of this conspiracy. It doesn't matter if the truth is right there out in front of your eyes. You will find a way, a mechanism, in order to keep your own system of denial. So as I always say it, denial is a river that runs in the - in Egypt. So we became very good in that. GROSS: When you were detained, Jon Stewart in the U. S. on \"The Daily Show\" did kind of a commentary about that, about how he was your friend and he didn't realize he was consorting with a criminal. And he quoted some of the things that Morsi had said about your show, charging you with, you know, insulting the president and insulting Islam. Then he showed a clip of Mohamed Morsi - of President Morsi - telling people to - these were older clips - telling people to nurse their children on hatred of Zionism and a clip of Morsi calling Zionists bloodsuckers descended from apes and pigs, so an example of him doing exactly what he charged you with doing, which is insulting religion. So as I watched that when it was happening I was wondering was that going to help you or hurt you because he is clearly expressing his - his deep connection with you, his deep friendship with you and his, you know, solidarity with you. At the same time, if it got back to President Morsi that Jon Stewart was satirizing Morsi on your behalf, I don't think President Morsi would've liked it very much. So did that have any impact, do you know, and did you think it was a good thing or a bad thing that he was doing that? YOUSSEF: Well, we have to look at this in context. At that time, although the Islamist regime was trying to get its own way in government but they were not strong enough to stop a program or, like - they tried but they couldn't because the people were against him. They kind of alienated the people in Egypt and it was difficult for them to operate through that. So here's, like, a paradox I'm going to tell you. So when Jon Stewart came to my defense, the anti-Islamist regime hailed that and, you know, said, like, this is amazing. You see, like, we shouldn't crack down on free speech, and you Islamist guys are, like, facists and whatever. When Jon Stewart came to my defense after Morsi - because I did the same thing with the regime that followed Morsi - the same people who hailed the move for Jon Stewart, they actually believed in the same conspiracy theories that the Islamists were propagating. And so, like, oh, you are asking for support from the West and from people who want to bring us down. It is very - it was a very, very interesting process to see the same people who stood next to you now because you are criticizing the regime that they support that they would use the same kind of lies and conspiracy theories that was used by the people against them. And I think that the religious and the military right wings are just two sides of the same coin if somebody uses God and religion and somebody uses country and security. And the people who hailed the support from outside just used that against me afterwards, which is very funny. GROSS: My guest is Bassem Youssef. His Egyptian TV series of political satire was modeled on \"The Daily Show. \" It was attacked by the government and was terminated in 2014. We'll talk more after we take a short break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross back with Bassem Youssef, who's become known in the U. S. as the Jon Stewart of Egypt. Youssef is a heart surgeon who gave up medicine to start a show of political satire in Egypt after the revolution overthrew President Hosni Mubarak. But even after the revolution, it was risky to satirize the government and Islam. Youssef's show was attacked by the government. The show was terminated in 2014 and he left the country. He recently moved to California and is working on a new satirical web series about American democracy that will premiere in the spring on the Fusion channel's new digital platform. What was Egyptian TV like when you started your show? YOUSSEF: A little bit, like, you know, locked in the '80s. We had, like, talk shows that went for hours. And the only popular shows were the ones that was imported, like franchised. Like we had our own \"Arab Idol,\" our own \"The Voice\". So these were the popular ones - entertainment, light entertainment, drama series and talk shows that went for hours. To have this kind of show, it was totally different. And it was a revolution. And maybe we are off the air now, but I'm very happy to see that people now are trying to replicate the kind of show that I was doing, but of course with a much lower ceiling. GROSS: What kind of comedy did you grow up with? Did you grow up with comedy? YOUSSEF: Yeah, of course. I mean, everybody grows up with comedy. I mean, Egyptian comedy has a very, very old tradition. Our theater and our movies are just, like, amazing. And Egypt is kind of like the Hollywood of the Middle East. I mean, we had cinema maybe decades before the other Arab countries ever got independence. So we had - of course, we grew up with the Egyptian comedy and of course with a lot of American comedy. I watched, you know, the sitcoms - the \"Friends,\" \"Frasier,\" all of that, you know, lovely American culture - and with the American movies as well as the Egyptian movies. GROSS: So you made the switch to satire after becoming a successful heart surgeon. And you were in Tahrir Square treating injured protesters during the Egyptian revolution. How did you decide that that's where you wanted to be at that moment? YOUSSEF: Well, at that moment, I didn't really plan ahead. At that moment, there was two things on my mind - first of all, what's going to happen in this revolution? And second, I had my papers - I was waiting for my papers from Cleveland where I was accepted in a pediatric heart surgery hospital. GROSS: Yeah, you had been accepted at the Rainbow Babies and Children's Hospital. . . YOUSSEF: Yes. GROSS: . . . Which is affiliated with Case Western Reserve University. And this was. . . YOUSSEF: Very good. Very good (laughter). GROSS: So you'd already spent, like, seven years in medical school, 12 years training in heart surgery. YOUSSEF: Yes. GROSS: You had this - what? - a fellowship in Cleveland at this hospital, which is a pretty big deal. YOUSSEF: Yeah, the papers were, like, you know - they were a little bit delayed with the lawyers and stuff. And I was waiting for it, so I would apply for my H-1 visa at that time. And, you know, after the revolution ended, the 18 days, I started to show in the Internet because during the 18 days I would go to the Square and I'd see the people. I would treat the people. I would go back home and I see the lies and deceit and the brainwashing on television. I said, like, you know what? This is not right. GROSS: Wait, let me stop you again. Give me an example of what you saw when you were working as a doctor treating wounded protesters in Tahrir Square during the Egyptian revolution and what you heard reported on television news. Give us an example of contrast. YOUSSEF: So what I saw day-to-day is like people who are actually asking for freedom, calling for freedom - protesting, singing, chanting, calling for the removal of the regime - plain and simple. And of course there were clashes there because people, they tried to remove those protesters from Tahrir. And I was, like, doing my job as a doctor treating them. So that's what I saw in real life. When you go back home, this is what you saw in Egyptian media. You saw all of these people calling and reporting ridiculous reports about those are operatives, those are spies, they are paid 50 euros and one bucket of the KFC dinner box in order to be there. So they were talking about how these people - operatives of the CIA, the Mossad, the Hezbollah, Hamas, Iran, Qatar - all at the same time. You would see reports about how America has infiltrated these people and they're sending their own spies in order to lead the revolution. So you would have people going out on television asking for bombing Tahrir Square or putting them under siege until they are die out of hunger. You had people, like, interviewing people with, quote, unquote, \"inside information about this is all a conspiracy from America and these are all spies. \" And so I had so many - so I said, this is not what I saw. This is all propaganda. So, like, just to kind of summarize it in one sentence - imagine Fox News but everywhere and more crazy and more non-credible. This is what we had. So I decided, like, you know, I want to do this. And I really didn't expect that people would watch my show. At that time, by the way, just to mention, there was no - absolutely no original Arabic content on YouTube. So I was actually the first one to go out with his face on the Internet and talk about stuff to people through YouTube. GROSS: I'm shocked to hear that. Why weren't there - was that because of government restrictions, or? YOUSSEF: No, there was, like - it was something that is not known in Egypt, you know? You may have to remember, it's 2008 - 2011 sorry. So maybe, like, two, three years this was - even YouTube was still, like, you know, becoming big in the States. It was not as common as it is now. People didn't know that, oh, we have - we can have actually a third window other than, like, radio and television. So I start to do this, and I said, look, maybe I'll have 10,000 views - that will be nice. You know, something - I'm, you know, I'm spending my time until my papers come from Cleveland. And suddenly, in two months, I have five million views and it is the show that everybody's talking about in Egypt. GROSS: So let's talk a little bit about growing up in Egypt. Your father, who I think died pretty recently after an auto accident - I'm very sorry that you lost him. Was that very recent? YOUSSEF: Yeah, that was eight, nine months ago, and yeah, my mom also died, like, a year and a half ago. But - so yes, I lost both of my parents. GROSS: Your father had been a judge in Egypt, and for a while, he was the head of the administrative court of the state council. What was that? I don't know what that means. YOUSSEF: It's basically he was the head of the court that would judge in disputes between the government - between government entities and each other. GROSS: OK, that's kind of a complicated position when you're working with a dictatorship, right? YOUSSEF: Yeah, but for a very long time, the judiciary was very independent. And my father maybe enjoyed one of the last days when he actually was independent, and he ruled a lot against the government. And because that, he was actually put into early retirement. So in a way, he was a revolutionary in his own self. He had a very impressive track record and how he - especially during Mubarak because he actually ruled to overrule many of the election results during the 2000 elections during Mubarak, the parliament elections. And he has a very, very impressive and pristine track record which I'm very proud of. GROSS: So what was it like for you growing up with a father who ruled against the government - controversial rulings? He was forced into early retirement as a result. Did it make you feel like to be defiant was great? Were you afraid of the consequences he and the family might face? YOUSSEF: Well, here's the thing. I can tell you something about both of my parents. My mom has also had her struggles because the wife of the prime minister at that time during Mubarak was in her same department. She was a professor of business administration, and she also stood against her and the government. So I come from a family who have revolted against the government in their own way. However, when I was on the show, they were always asking me to hold back because it's different when it's your son out there. As a matter of fact, they did not approve of many of my revolutionary messages, and they said, like - maybe it's different because they were getting older and they didn't want any trouble. But it was very interesting to see that during their own career lives they didn't shut up and they didn't stop and they didn't hold back, but when it has to come to their son, they were very protective. GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is Bassem Youssef, who became known as the Jon Stewart of the Arab world after the Egyptian Revolution when he hosted a satirical news show in Egypt, a show inspired by \"The Daily Show. \" Let's take a short break then we'll talk some more. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is Bassem Youssef, who became known here as the Jon Stewart of the Arab world after the Egyptian revolution when he started hosting a satirical news show inspired by \"The Daily Show. \" But the then-Egyptian president, Mohamed Morsi, accused him of insulting the president and insulting religion. And that, and other things, led to the demise of the show in 2014 and to Youssef being detained and interrogated. He has now signed a deal to create a show for the American cable channel Fusion TV - an American satirical web series in April that's going to satirize American democracy. So you've been in the states for about a month. And I imagine you've been watching the coverage of the presidential campaigns and the lead up to the Iowa caucuses, the speeches, the night of the Iowa caucuses. So I'm so interested in your impressions. And I suppose we should start with Donald Trump saying - though he said this before you came, but I'm sure you're aware of it - that, you know, that the United States should not allow Muslims into the country. YOUSSEF: Well, I think Donald Trump trade is just to offend everybody and see how it works. And I think - I don't care about Donald Trump himself. I care and I worry about the very big base that supports him because this kind of language would have been absolutely nonexistent maybe 15, 20 - by the way, I follow the American elections, and I have never seen someone who is that offensive. I have seen people who are stupid. But stupid and offensive, that's new. And the problem is the rising amount of support that this kind of narrative is gaining in the United States is what worries me. It's not what - who says it. And these people are using the fear. And they're using the hate. And they ride on that. And you have a lot of people supporting it. I mean, who would know - who would've - like, if you mention this 16 years later, you would think that George W. Bush is sane and he is, yes, a little bit of a brain compared to what's happening now. But the thing is Donald Trump is not stupid. He knows exactly what he's saying. And he's just saying out there - I mean, forget about Muslims. He said I could go down on Fifth Avenue in New York and shoot someone in the face and people - and the voters will have no problem with it. This transcends any kind of religion and any kind of belief. This is actually an offense and attack on human values. He's just saying out there I will shoot people in the face and people wouldn't care. GROSS: On the day of the Iowa caucuses, Donald Trump said that he'd been told by people in his security that there were people with tomatoes ready to throw tomatoes at him when he spoke. So he told his audience, if you see somebody with tomatoes, knock the crap out of them and don't worry about lawsuits because he would pay the legal fees. YOUSSEF: Yeah. GROSS: Did you hear that or read that? And I wonder what went through your mind. YOUSSEF: Well, this is a demagogue. I mean, this guy, if he was dressed into some sort of a military attire and he is from the Middle East, I mean, he would just, like, fit right in if you changed the language. This kind of, like, using the people, galvanizing the people in order to do hateful stuff, physical stuff and it's like, don't worry, you're protected, is absolutely no difference from what's happening in the rest of world dictatorships. And, I mean, let's call things as they are. He is a fear monger, and he is a racist and a bigot - as simple as that. GROSS: So you've been living in Dubai, right? YOUSSEF: Yes, for a year after I left Egypt. GROSS: How did you choose Dubai? YOUSSEF: Well, a number of things - it was closer and the producer of my show, who actually fled Egypt before me because they arrested his father and brother, went to Dubai, so there was already a set up there. So for me, it was a good transitional, like, zone area to be there before I moved to the states. GROSS: That's terrifying. They arrested his father and brother as a way of sending him a message? YOUSSEF: Well, I mean, we have some sort of a Greek tragedy because he was the producer of my show, and his father and brother was members of the Muslim brotherhood. So it doesn't really matter if you were. . . GROSS: Oh, I see. YOUSSEF: . . . If you were involved in terrorist attack. Just being in that group is enough to actually arrest you. So I don't - because, like, I know for a fact that his father was at home. He didn't participate in anything. And the fact that they have actually arrested him on the night of my comeback and making fun of the present regime sends you a message. So at that time, he was on a business trip in Dubai, and he never came back when he saw his father being arrested. GROSS: And did seeing that help inspire you to leave? YOUSSEF: No, it took me another year. And I continued with my show for another season until I was shut down. I didn't actually leave until they went to, like, a court of law in order to get an arbitration case against me. It was a sham verdict, of course. It was strange. It's a little bit complicated. My - the TV channel that was hosting my show ended my show. And we went to court. And they actually asked for a compensation. And they got it for 15 million dollars, which is crazy, right? Because they are the one who actually shut down my show. So, like, when that verdict came out, I knew that - they knew that I don't have 15 million dollars. They knew that I can't pay that. So I knew that they will use this in order to ban me from traveling or put me in jail, so I escaped. GROSS: You escaped? YOUSSEF: Yes, I did. GROSS: So you weren't able to just kind of, like, leave normally? You had to escape? YOUSSEF: No, I mean, like, I got on a plane just four hours after the verdict because I don't know how that play out. GROSS: Right, right. YOUSSEF: And maybe, looking back, I think this was the right decision to do. GROSS: How nervous were you that you wouldn't make it out? YOUSSEF: I was very nervous. And I was very nervous, and I was very worried about what will happen. But thank God I was not stopped in the airport. But the minute I landed the other side, I opened Twitter and social media, and the news of the verdict was all over the place. So, yeah, maybe we kind of, like, had a very, very, very, like, close break. GROSS: So I wish you all success in the U. S. YOUSSEF: Thank you. GROSS: Will you be moving here? YOUSSEF: Yeah, I'm already living in northern California in the East Bay, where it's very nice and pleasant. And it's a beautiful state to be in. GROSS: Well, I wish you the best. I will be looking for you and looking for your web series when it starts. YOUSSEF: Yes. GROSS: Thank you so much and be well. And thank you so much for doing this interview. YOUSSEF: Thank you so much. GROSS: Bassem Youssef will speak at the New York Live Arts - Live Ideas festival on Feb. 8. His new satirical series, \"The Democracy Handbook,\" will premiere in the spring on the Fusion channel's new digital platform. Coming up, Milo Miles reviews a new album by alternative hip-hop artist Lizzo, who's recorded with Prince. That's after a break.

S. , it's Black History Month. That's the time that's been designated to reflect on the history and contributions of people of African descent to the United States. And while some people still disagree with it, for the most part in this country, calling oneself or being described as black or African-American is not unusual. Not so in Mexico but that may soon change. For the first time in Mexican history, the government is planning to allow its citizens to officially recognize themselves as Afro-Mexicans in the upcoming 2020 census. We wanted to learn more about this so we called Luisa Ortiz. She is the CEO of Nova Mexico. That's a nonprofit organization that works with minority groups in Mexico. Hello, Luisa Ortiz, thanks so much for speaking with us. LUISA ORTIZ: Thank you so much for inviting me. Hi. MARTIN: For people who aren't really familiar with the history, could you just describe the presence of people of African descent in Mexico? How did this happen? As I understand it, this is a result of the Spanish conquest - that Spanish leaders imported slaves from Africa. Is that correct? ORTIZ: It is. It is. And they're actually - you could say there are two big waves of arrival of people of African descent. One of them would definitely be the 16th century. And there is definitely a second wave, and that is in the '50s and '60s after the independence of several nations in Africa. Many people arrived in the region and they arrived to Mexico probably on their way to the United States or not. But some of them stayed. And I would probably even think now there could be a third wave of people of African descent arriving, coming from Haiti, coming from Cuba, coming from Venezuela or even from Colombia. MARTIN: So why now, though? Why is the Mexican government now adding Afro-Mexican to the census? I take it there was no such option before. ORTIZ: There has never been that option.  The last time people of African descent were counted was in the 19th century. The Mexican federal government is arriving late to the party. I believe that this is the result of a bottom-up movement. Many, many organizations, for years now, have worked with communities in the coast and organizations that are mostly international found out and they saw that people happen to be of African descent. So this is the result of many, many years of philanthropy that bring to the fore organizations that today are becoming, politically, very active. I think that the federal government is reacting to the politicization of civil society that happens to be of African descent. MARTIN: Well, I think a lot of people are familiar with the fact that people with indigenous backgrounds do feel that they face discrimination. Do Afro-Mexicans feel that they face discrimination? ORTIZ: Absolutely, and they even feel discrimination from their indigenous brothers and sisters. It is not easy - it is not an easy debate. Until last year - until 2015, black Mexicans were requesting to be identified as indigenous because there was no category in the census. And they were asked if they spoke an indigenous language and they would have to say yes. But when they would have to clarify which language it was, you would come to interesting results, such as we speak some Patois, some Haitian, that form of French, some Yoruba or else, so it's very, very interesting. MARTIN: What do you think the result will be of allowing this designation? ORTIZ: I envision on the positive side, a lot of young men and young women who are feeling comfortable with who they are. And definitely, there is some sense of pride in seeing somebody you actually look like making it big, making a movie, winning an Oscar, being president of a country, a senator. So one the one hand, the result is that people globally are recognizing, with pride and dignity, who they are and what they can achieve. On the not-so-positive side, I believe this is definitely a political maneuver. Black Mexicans live in territories where there's politics, and the acceptance of their ethnicity could probably pigeonhole them to be members of different political parties in the coming elections. So I don't think it is so romantic. It is definitely far more nuanced and complex. MARTIN: That was Luisa Ortiz speaking to us from Mexico City. She's the CEO of Nova Mexico. Luisa Ortiz, thanks so much for speaking with us. ORTIZ: Thank you so much for having me. MARTIN: We wanted to hear more so we called several people who identify as Afro-Mexican. Here is one of them. She is Dora Callegas (ph). She's from the province of Veracruz in Mexico. She says she's very proud of her roots, but when she travels to different parts of Mexico, she feels different being Afro-Mexican. DORA CALLEGAS: (Through interpreter) People looked at me and asked if I was Brazilian, Cuban, Colombian - things other than Mexican - because in Mexico, it's difficult for people to recognize that there are Afro descendants. Because of that, I became interested in finding my roots. MARTIN: This is part of our series of conversations we're having for Black History Month called Black And. We're talking with people all over the country and the world about what it means to be Black And. We're interested in your ideas - the best way to reach us is via Twitter, using the #BlackAnd.

For years, the military has tried to replicate it. The Navy's funding focuses on training dogs to recognize improvised explosive devices or IEDs, which is difficult, as Jimmy Jenkins reports from member station KJZZ. JIMMY JENKINS, BYLINE: Rohan is a small, black-and-brown shelter dog with perky ears and earnest eyes. He's at the Canine Science Lab on the campus of Arizona State University, getting ready for his test. NATHAN HALL: All right. So he stuck his nose in. That's triggering the start of a trial. Now he had an itch, so that trial got canceled. JENKINS: Researcher Nathan Hall is watching as Rohan puts his pointy black nose into a machine that can present thousands of scent mixtures - everything from vanilla to ammonium nitrate. It's called an olfactometer. HALL: Now he's triggering the new trial. Odor is being presented. JENKINS: As Rohan keeps his nose in the olfactometer, a computer directs scents to an odor port where he can sniff them. If he smells the target odor, he keeps his nose in. If he doesn't, he takes his nose out. HALL: He's keeping his nose in, and he gets food for that. That was a correct hit. That was a hit response. The odor was there. He made the correct indication. JENKINS: Hall is part of a team studying how to train dogs to identify a wide variety of ingredients that could be used to make bombs. Clive Wynne directs the study which is funded by the Office of Naval Research. CLIVE WYNNE: So we're now asking dogs not just to find a needle in a haystack. Now the problem is more like saying to the dog, we need you to find any sharp object in the haystack. JENKINS: The dogs not only have to detect whether explosive ingredients are present. They also have to determine if the agents they smell could combine to form an explosive mixture. Wynne says history shows that some of those ingredients don't seem dangerous at all. WYNNE: I grew up in Britain, and when I was a child, there was a series of terrorist attacks on Britain. And I only recently learned that the critical explosive fuel was confectioner's sugar. Now, would there be a purpose in training dogs to find confectioner's sugar - obviously not. JENKINS: But Wynne says that dogs need to learn that when combined with other elements, even sugar could be used in a bomb. WYNNE: We want the dogs to grasp the concept of - this might go bang, and we do that not by showing the dog one explosive and one not explosive smell but by showing the dog thousands of different explosive smells and thousands of different nonexplosive smells. JENKINS: It's a much different approach than just teaching dogs to detect explosives like TNT or C4. Joong Kim is a program manager with the Office of Naval Research. He says dogs used by the Marines are having a difficult time finding roadside bombs in Iraq and Afghanistan. JOONG KIM: Their components can be in a different ratio, different quality, and that does seem to have some effect on performance of the canine. JENKINS: Kim says the big problem is that IEDs are just that - improvised and completely inconsistent. KIM: That variation is actually the challenging part of being able to identify and locate those threats. JENKINS: Back at the lab, Rohan takes a break from the trials to check out my microphone. Lab director Clive Wynne says Rohan's nose is over a thousand times more powerful than a human's nose. WYNNE: United States defense research agencies spent billions of dollars over the last 15 years trying to create a technological replacement for the nose of the dog. And at the end of all that, they just had to admit, no, we cannot get close. JENKINS: Wynne thinks his team can develop bomb-sniffing dogs that can detect IEDs at a fraction of that price. All it takes is patience and a little positive reinforcement. Good boy, Rohan. Good Boy. For NPR News, I'm Jimmy Jenkins in Phoenix.

He's bringing a message that might not go down well with the country's conservative Catholic elites, but that's not the audience the Pope is focused on. NPR's Carrie Kahn reports. CARRIE KAHN, BYLINE: Alejandro Hernandez and his crew assembled dozens of bleachers along the main thoroughfare in the dusty, poor, sprawling city of Ecatepec outside Mexico City. ALEJANDRO HERNANDEZ: (Speak Spanish). KAHN: \"These are just for the 2000-or-so people who watch the pope drive by,\" says Hernandez. Another 300,000 are expected to pack into a nearby college to join the pontiff for Sunday mass. Ecatepec is infamous for its poverty and high rate of crime against women. The pope's stop here is fitting with his focus on marginalized communities. And this city of 2 million is notorious for its endless graffiti. It's hard to find a concrete surface not covered with a piece or a tag, so the city whitewashed nearly four miles of the wall along the pope's travel route and gave 50 of Ecatepec's graffiti artists a spot to lay up their best Francis-inspired drawing. There's the pope with his arms wide open, the pope as a mariachi singer and even the pope spraying some art himself. DANIEL MACIEL: (Speaking Spanish). KAHN: Thirty-year-old graffitero and computer instructor Daniel Maciel says it's a nice break from tagging walls or vandalizing the subway. He says he stayed away from crosses and bleeding hearts and instead painted the pope a 10-foot-tall Aztec woman and an eagle warrior. MACIEL: (Speaking Spanish). KAHN: \"Before anything, even religion,\" he says, \"we have our roots. \" During a six-day stay, Pope Francis plans to travel to the southern state of Chiapas and authorize the use of indigenous languages in mass celebrations. He'll travel north to Juarez across the border from El Paso, Texas, and hold a bi-national mass in solidarity with migrants. And in between, he'll visit some of the most violent regions of the country hit hard by drug trafficking. Pope Francis said he understands what Mexicans are living through - their own, quote, \"little piece of war. \"(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)POPE FRANCIS: (Speaking Spanish). KAHN: \"And of course, I don't want to overlook any of that,\" said Francis in a video message on Mexico's Notimex news agency. \"On the contrary,\" he added, \"I will exhort you to fight every day against corruption and organized crime. \" Pope Francis's words aren't getting the warmest welcome in some circles, says Elio Masferrer Kan, an anthropologist and religion expert. ELIO MASFERRER KAN: (Speaking Spanish). KAHN: \"His outspokenness is a thorn in the side of the conservative sectors of Mexico's Catholic hierarchy,\" says Masferrer, \"the ones allied with the wealthy and political elite,\" he adds. Francis's visit comes as the Mexican economy is slumping and the current administration is plagued by corruption scandals and human rights abuses. For 55-year-old housewife Olivia Salazar, the pope's timing is perfect. She smiles as she rides her bike past the new pope-inspired murals painted for his arrival this weekend in Ecatepec. OLIVIA SALAZAR: (Speaking Spanish). KAHN: He's coming to all these difficult places,\" she says, \"because we need him and we need his faith. \" Carrie Kahn, NPR News, Ecatepec, Mexico.

CARRIE KAHN, BYLINE: Alejandro Hernandez and his crew assembled dozens of bleachers along the main thoroughfare in the dusty, poor, sprawling city of Ecatepec outside Mexico City. ALEJANDRO HERNANDEZ: (Speak Spanish). KAHN: \"These are just for the 2000-or-so people who watch the pope drive by,\" says Hernandez. Another 300,000 are expected to pack into a nearby college to join the pontiff for Sunday mass. Ecatepec is infamous for its poverty and high rate of crime against women. The pope's stop here is fitting with his focus on marginalized communities. And this city of 2 million is notorious for its endless graffiti. It's hard to find a concrete surface not covered with a piece or a tag, so the city whitewashed nearly four miles of the wall along the pope's travel route and gave 50 of Ecatepec's graffiti artists a spot to lay up their best Francis-inspired drawing. There's the pope with his arms wide open, the pope as a mariachi singer and even the pope spraying some art himself. DANIEL MACIEL: (Speaking Spanish). KAHN: Thirty-year-old graffitero and computer instructor Daniel Maciel says it's a nice break from tagging walls or vandalizing the subway. He says he stayed away from crosses and bleeding hearts and instead painted the pope a 10-foot-tall Aztec woman and an eagle warrior. MACIEL: (Speaking Spanish). KAHN: \"Before anything, even religion,\" he says, \"we have our roots. \" During a six-day stay, Pope Francis plans to travel to the southern state of Chiapas and authorize the use of indigenous languages in mass celebrations. He'll travel north to Juarez across the border from El Paso, Texas, and hold a bi-national mass in solidarity with migrants. And in between, he'll visit some of the most violent regions of the country hit hard by drug trafficking. Pope Francis said he understands what Mexicans are living through - their own, quote, \"little piece of war. \" (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) POPE FRANCIS: (Speaking Spanish). KAHN: \"And of course, I don't want to overlook any of that,\" said Francis in a video message on Mexico's Notimex news agency. \"On the contrary,\" he added, \"I will exhort you to fight every day against corruption and organized crime. \" Pope Francis's words aren't getting the warmest welcome in some circles, says Elio Masferrer Kan, an anthropologist and religion expert. ELIO MASFERRER KAN: (Speaking Spanish). KAHN: \"His outspokenness is a thorn in the side of the conservative sectors of Mexico's Catholic hierarchy,\" says Masferrer, \"the ones allied with the wealthy and political elite,\" he adds. Francis's visit comes as the Mexican economy is slumping and the current administration is plagued by corruption scandals and human rights abuses. For 55-year-old housewife Olivia Salazar, the pope's timing is perfect. She smiles as she rides her bike past the new pope-inspired murals painted for his arrival this weekend in Ecatepec. OLIVIA SALAZAR: (Speaking Spanish). KAHN: He's coming to all these difficult places,\" she says, \"because we need him and we need his faith. \" Carrie Kahn, NPR News, Ecatepec, Mexico.", "section": "Religion", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.

I'm Guy Raz. And on the show today, ideas about what it means To Endure and the things that pull us through, make us resilient. Do you think of yourself as a resilient person? ZAINAB SALBI: For sure, I am a resilient person (laughter). RAZ: This is Zainab Salbi. She works with women in war zones. SALBI: I think resilience as something that is part of us. You know, I think we all have it. But we all don't think we have it. But when we face our own challenge, we have it, you know. We are a resilient species, in my opinion. We are a resilient humanity. RAZ: Resilience was something Zainab had to figure out pretty early on. It was the only way to survive the things she witnessed as a child living in Iraq because when she was barely 11, in September 1980, the Iran-Iraq War began. And it was a war that would last eight years. Zainab Salbi described her memories of the war from the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SALBI: I woke up in the middle of the night with a sound of heavy explosion. Everything in my room was shaking - my heart, my windows, my bed. I looked out the windows, and I saw a full half circle of explosion. I thought it was just like the movies, but the movies had not conveyed them in the powerful image that I was seeing. I went back to my bed. And I prayed. And I secretly thanked God that that missile did not land on my family's home. I grew up with the colors of war - the red colors of fire and blood, the brown tones of earth as it explodes in our faces and the piercing silver of an exploded missile so bright that nothing can protect your eyes from it. I grew up with the sounds of war - the wrenching booms of explosions, ominous drones of jets flying overhead and the wailing warning sounds of sirens. RAZ: So imagine trying to live a normal life in the middle of something so abnormal. This is basically what Zainab's mother tried to do. Her whole idea of enduring, of getting through it, of even defying the war - was to be normal, was to create a parallel world for her children. SALBI: Here we are. You know, and I have two brothers. And, like, in the middle of the sirens - and there was a lot of instructions of what you do when the siren comes, which means Iranian planes are filling the skies of Baghdad. My mom - she would have this puppet shows for my brothers and I with her hands. And she would make all these jokes and all of these things, and we are just having fun actually. It took me a long time to realize outside of us there were the sirens and the planes and the bombing and all of that. But her purpose as a mother in that moment of fear is to keep life going, is to make us - you know. that we are safe, that - let's laugh. It's OK. That's what parents do. That's, you know, you see the beauty of life. Keeping the beauty of life - keeping love is part of resilience. RAZ: During the war, Zainab's father was in the Iraqi army, so she didn't get to see him all that much. And in fact, most of the people she did see weren't on the front lines. SALBI: I could see, as a child, that all the - you know, everything that was talked about on TV was from male perspective - the men fighting, bullets, you know - army , tanks, airplanes, all of it. But actually, as a child, I was witnessing women in my life. My mother was a woman. The teachers were women. People who run the grocery shop were women. The factories were run by women, and suddenly I realized that wow - so the world thinks of war from a male perspective, which is not untrue. It is true except they are missing the other aspect of war, which is that women are really keeping life going in the midst of war. RAZ: After the war ended Zainab left Iraq for the U. S. , but she never forgot that other side of war - the side most of us never see - the side in which life somehow goes on and endures. So in her early 20s, she started a group called Women for Women International. It's dedicated to helping women who live in war zones, and Zainab began to travel to some of those places. SALBI: You know, when I first went to war zones, I would, like, you know, wear my jeans and sneakers. And like, OK. I'm a women's right activist and a humanitarian, and I'm here to help people. And honestly, it was from the women that I thought I was helping who taught me how to enjoy beauty and celebrate it. It was women in Bosnia, for example, during the days of Sarajevo. It was longest besieged city. And I went in the besiege. And I went - I was like OK - what do you want me to bring you next time I'm here? And the woman said lipstick. I'm, like, lipstick? RAZ: (Laughter). SALBI: What are you talking about? Don't you want - I don't know - vitamins? You know, something, I don't know. And they're like lipstick. I was like - why? And they said because it's the smallest thing we put on every day and we feel we are beautiful, and that's how we are resisting. They want us to feel that we are dead. They want us to feel that we are ugly. And one woman, she said, I put the lipstick every time I leave because I want that sniper, before he shoots me, to know he is killing a beautiful woman. And I look at her, and I was, like, that's how she's keeping her beauty. Like, who am I to take myself so seriously when they are keeping life going through beauty and through the joy, just as my mother did when I was a child? And so that act of resilience - you keep the joy. You keep the laughter. You keep singing the song. You keep the melodies of the song going. That's how women resist and show their resilience in the darkest of circumstances, and that's what war is. RAZ: Zainab says it's these stories of women enduring and resisting that we just never hear about. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SALBI: We are missing the story of Fareeda, a music teacher in Sarajevo, who made sure that she kept the music school open every single day in the four years of besiege in Sarajevo and walked to that school, despite the snipers shooting at that school and at her, and kept the piano, the violin, the cello playing the whole duration of the war, with students wearing their gloves and hats and coats. That was her fight. That was her resistance. We are missing the story of Nehia, a Palestinian woman in Gaza who, the minute there was a cease-fire, she left out of home, collected all the flours (ph) and baked as much bread for every neighbor to have, in case there is no cease-fire the day after. We are missing the stories of Violet, who, despite surviving of a genocide in the church massacre, she kept on going on - burying bodies, building homes, cleaning the streets. We are missing stories of women who are literally keeping life going in the midst of wars. Do you know - do you know that people fall in love in war and go to school and go to factories and hospitals and get divorced and go dancing and go playing and live life going? RAZ: Where do you think that instinct comes from, you know, that allows us to keep going? Because when I hear these stories, I can't help but think, you know, I don't know if I could do that. SALBI: Absolutely. There are lots of times I went through that stage, where I feel like this is too much. I don't want to do it. It's too ugly for me. It's too disgusting.  It's too cruel. I cannot do it. But then it takes one act of kindness. It takes one good story. It takes one blossom of a, like, a plant, a flower in between the dry earth. Have you been walking somewhere and you see a small blossom of some green? RAZ: Yeah, yeah. SALBI: It takes one of that, one act of kindness that turns things around for us and keeps us believing in the goodness of humanity. RAZ: It's almost like a survival mechanism, you know? Like, we're wired to survive and perpetuate our species. And if we didn't endure - if we weren't resilient, we would die, right? We wouldn't make it. SALBI: I agree. And I think, you know, it's not only instinctual. I mean, some of us it's instinctual. I mean, my experience of people - it's honestly a belief - I don't know how to explain it other than - you know, you believe in God. You believe in miracles. You believe in something that is impossible to make it possible - in an intangible thing that is so strong in human spirit. But we don't know how to account for it, you know? We don't know how to measure it, but it is hope - it's hope. That hope, that belief in something that is something possible. Something good can happen. That's sort of the thread that pulls us out of our darkness, be it a person who is depressed or be it a person in a war. It doesn't matter. There is a possibility. Love can be there. Things can be better. That belief is always there in human beings. RAZ: Zainab Salbi - she now hosts a talk show for Arab women that's broadcast throughout the Middle East and North Africa. You can see her entire talk at ted. com. GUY RAZ, HOST:  It's the TED Radio Hour from NPR. I'm Guy Raz. And on the show today, ideas about what it means To Endure and the things that pull us through, make us resilient. Do you think of yourself as a resilient person?

Soldiers angle to wear the blue helmet and earn an international salary and other benefits covered by the United Nations. NPR's Gregory Warner reports on just how far some soldiers will go to obtain a peacekeeping post. GREGORY WARNER, BYLINE: Some will apparently kill for it. The United Nations just ordered three peacekeepers posted in the Central African Republic to return to Burundi for human rights abuses committed there. It's lifted the lid on a disturbing incentives system that starts with how coveted these postings are. Yolande Bouka is a researcher for the Institute for Security Studies based in South Africa. She says soldiers can earn at least ten times the salary that they'd make at home in Burundi, and there are other benefits. YOLANDE BOUKA: For some of the soldiers, what is also very important is the premium they get should they die in action. These international missions provide a very generous package for the family that's left behind. WARNER: But to win these posts, a soldier has to pledge loyalty to Burundi's government. And Burundi has used its security forces to torture and kill members of the political opposition. The crisis began in April when the president ran for an apparently illegal third term in office. Since then, hundreds have been killed, hundreds of thousands have fled, and there are fears that violence is awakening buried ethnic tensions. Bouka says the military is ethically mixed and it's showing signs of splitting apart. There's even been a failed coup. But the military has mostly cohered behind the president in large part because in a country of such massive unemployment, soldiers don't want to jeopardize the chance at a foreign posting that could set up their family for life. BOUKA: There have been some individuals in the military who believe that if they engage in violence - violently suppress opposition or the rebellion, they will be able to reap the reward of their allegiance by being sent abroad.

Two former military officers stand accused of murder, kidnapping and keeping nearly a dozen indigenous women as domestic and sex slaves during that country's long civil war. This is believed to be the first time any national court has addressed sex slavery as a part of prosecuted war crimes. To find out more, we reached out to Kelsey Alford-Jones. She's the director of the Guatemalan Human Rights Commission, which has a representative at the trial. The Guatemalan war was brutal. It lasted 36 years and resulted in hundreds of thousands of deaths and disappearances. Most of the genocide and other crimes targeted Mayans. And I started off by asking Kelsey Alford-Jones to explain that. As you can imagine, some of the details we're about to discuss are disturbing, so I want to alert listeners to that. KELSEY ALFORD-JONES: When you look at the victims of the violence in Guatemala, the vast majority were indigenous Mayans - about 83 percent according to the U. N. Truth Commission that finished a report in 1999, and about 93 percent of the human rights violations were carried out by the military. So there was definitely an ethnic component. MARTIN: Talk to me about these 11 women in particular. ALFORD-JONES: Well, the women in this case are in their 70s and 80s. They speak Q'eqchi - a Mayan language. First, their husbands were disappeared. Their husbands were working to legalize their land in this area that was principally owned by large landowning families. The women that were left alone after their husbands had been disappeared were then targeted by the military that had set up a series of military outposts in this region in Guatemala. And they forced the women to live right outside the military base and to do shifts where they would go cook for the soldiers, clean for the soldiers and, as part of that, they were also repeatedly raped during those shifts. So for some women, that repeated rape happened over period of days or months, and for some women it happened over a period of years. Four women were able to escape. And one woman tells of how she fled into the mountains with her four children. Her children lived through hunger, fear, disease. And six years later, when she came down, she only had one surviving child with her. MARTIN: Is there a defense? ALFORD-JONES: In this particular case, no one is denying that these women were sexually abused. What we've seen so far is actually - rather than a legal defense, we've seen the lawyers of the two accused simply try to delay the trial, to say that they don't think that the trial is legitimate. We have not seen any kind of defense presented. MARTIN: So they have not denied the specificity of these allegations. What they have done is to object to the legitimacy - raise questions about the legitimacy of the proceeding itself. Do you have confidence in these proceedings? ALFORD-JONES: We all have every hope that it will reach a conclusion, that there will be a verdict based on rule of law and strong evidence. However, the Guatemalan justice system still has huge challenges, so I do hope that the conditions are right for this trial to move forward effectively. MARTIN: How are these women doing? ALFORD-JONES: Well, you know, these women have spent almost their entire lives in situations of extreme poverty. They have health implications from that violence that has not been dealt with because they have not had access to medical care. And one of the scariest things that I think I've heard from a couple of the women who I spoke with recently is that they fear that these types of things can happen again. And so the women wanted - and that's what happened. And most importantly, they don't want other women to have to go through the same thing. MARTIN: Kelsey Alford-Jones is the director of the Guatemalan Human Rights Commission. She joined us here in our Washington, D. C. , studios. And as we mentioned, a member of the commission is observing the trial in Guatemala as we speak. Kelsey Alford-Jones, thanks so much for speaking with us. ALFORD-JONES: Thank you. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  We're going to spend some time now on events in Guatemala, where a historic trial began last week. Two former military officers stand accused of murder, kidnapping and keeping nearly a dozen indigenous women as domestic and sex slaves during that country's long civil war. This is believed to be the first time any national court has addressed sex slavery as a part of prosecuted war crimes. To find out more, we reached out to Kelsey Alford-Jones. She's the director of the Guatemalan Human Rights Commission, which has a representative at the trial. The Guatemalan war was brutal. It lasted 36 years and resulted in hundreds of thousands of deaths and disappearances. Most of the genocide and other crimes targeted Mayans. And I started off by asking Kelsey Alford-Jones to explain that. As you can imagine, some of the details we're about to discuss are disturbing, so I want to alert listeners to that. KELSEY ALFORD-JONES: When you look at the victims of the violence in Guatemala, the vast majority were indigenous Mayans - about 83 percent according to the U. N. Truth Commission that finished a report in 1999, and about 93 percent of the human rights violations were carried out by the military. So there was definitely an ethnic component. MARTIN: Talk to me about these 11 women in particular. ALFORD-JONES: Well, the women in this case are in their 70s and 80s. They speak Q'eqchi - a Mayan language. First, their husbands were disappeared. Their husbands were working to legalize their land in this area that was principally owned by large landowning families. The women that were left alone after their husbands had been disappeared were then targeted by the military that had set up a series of military outposts in this region in Guatemala. And they forced the women to live right outside the military base and to do shifts where they would go cook for the soldiers, clean for the soldiers and, as part of that, they were also repeatedly raped during those shifts. So for some women, that repeated rape happened over period of days or months, and for some women it happened over a period of years. Four women were able to escape. And one woman tells of how she fled into the mountains with her four children. Her children lived through hunger, fear, disease. And six years later, when she came down, she only had one surviving child with her. MARTIN: Is there a defense? ALFORD-JONES: In this particular case, no one is denying that these women were sexually abused. What we've seen so far is actually - rather than a legal defense, we've seen the lawyers of the two accused simply try to delay the trial, to say that they don't think that the trial is legitimate. We have not seen any kind of defense presented. MARTIN: So they have not denied the specificity of these allegations. What they have done is to object to the legitimacy - raise questions about the legitimacy of the proceeding itself. Do you have confidence in these proceedings? ALFORD-JONES: We all have every hope that it will reach a conclusion, that there will be a verdict based on rule of law and strong evidence. However, the Guatemalan justice system still has huge challenges, so I do hope that the conditions are right for this trial to move forward effectively. MARTIN: How are these women doing? ALFORD-JONES: Well, you know, these women have spent almost their entire lives in situations of extreme poverty. They have health implications from that violence that has not been dealt with because they have not had access to medical care. And one of the scariest things that I think I've heard from a couple of the women who I spoke with recently is that they fear that these types of things can happen again. And so the women wanted - and that's what happened. And most importantly, they don't want other women to have to go through the same thing.

We called her up far away. And first things first - happy birthday, Alice. ALICE CARTER: Yeah. I can't believe it. Here I am, 87 years old. I don't even know how I got there. But I'm not the oldest volunteer that ever served in the Peace Corps. Twenty years ago, there was a guy in Ghana who was 90, so I'm second. But right now, I'm at the top. MARTIN: This is Alice Carter speaking to us from a village outside Rabat, Morocco, where she is, yes, the oldest person currently volunteering in the Peace Corps. She's a Bostonian with six kids, grandkids. And she says she's been interested about the world for a long time - since 1939, when her father sponsored a Jewish refugee from Germany who told her why he fled the Nazis - since 1960, when she heard JFK urge young Americans to dedicate themselves to peace and progress around the world. CARTER: And I was there with no college education and up to my eyeballs in diapers. And I thought - gee, I'd like to do that, but it's not going to happen. But it was like a little blip, like when you fall in love with somebody and, you know, that little blip - that click goes off. And you say that's for me. And so the Peace Corps was kind of like - that's for me. But there was a lot of road to travel before I got there. MARTIN: You lived all this life. You were involved in the civil rights movement and in counseling people through addiction. And you have a long kind of history of volunteerism. CARTER: Right. MARTIN: But like you said, you had six kids. You were busy raising a family. So what happened in your life that the Peace Corps became an option again? I mean, did someone plant the idea for you, or did you see an ad? What happened? CARTER: Oh, it was wonderful. I went to a party in Vermont and I met a whole lot of 1960s Peace Corps graduates. And they were all at this party, and there was a recruiter there. And so I kind of wandered over and said - what's the cutoff? And she said oh, there's no age limit. And bingo - I went home, got on the computer and started applying right away. MARTIN: You thought - yeah, this is my moment. CARTER: Right. MARTIN: What did your kids say? CARTER: They were like (laughter) - oh, they'll tell her to apply. They'll let her apply, but they'll never give her an assignment. She's too old. But they were wrong, and they came around - almost 100 percent of them, except my granddaughter, who was from get-go no Peace Corps, no Peace Corps. And I said no, I'm going to go. I can't stand Boston anymore. I'm too old, and I keep falling down in the snow. I have to find a warmer climate, so I kind of presented it to her that way. MARTIN: (Laughter) You could have gone to Arizona or Florida. CARTER: (Laughter) Never. The whole idea of retiring with people my age - they're wonderful, people my age who go to those places to retire. And I see them on trains holding hands and going someplace together, and I say that's not you. That's not where you're going (laughter), but. . . MARTIN: This part of life - when people - and women, in particular - are in their twilight years - 70s, 80s, 90s - they tend to disappear from public life or at least that's the perception. This is clearly not how you are choosing to spend these years. That - you are not interested in sitting in the backseat at all. CARTER: You could say that, yes. I like being very active. I like being with people, and my whole life has been forming relationships and so that has to continue. You can't quit. I've been told that it's hard to make friends as you get older. I have not found that to be true. In the Peace Corps, I've made a lot of friends of younger people and the people my - well, younger than me - in their 60s and 70s who are here. MARTIN: Are there a lot of people in that age range? I mean, when I think of the Peace Corps, I think of people who are at the opposite end of the spectrum - people just out of college in their 20s. CARTER: Well, most of the people are in their 20s. There's a bunch in their 30s, a few in their 40s. And then you get 50s, 60s, and 70s - there's a bigger group. I mean, we're not bigger than the younger people. But it's - you know, I would say there are probably 15 or 20 of us in Morocco who are in the senior citizen category. And I think that for people who are thinking about it who are our age, there's some specific concerns. And one of them would be health. You kind of have to tinker with your body as you get older, so it's wonderful to have a supportive Peace Corps medical staff, which we have in Rabat. So that's one thing. Energy is another. And when I first came, the head of the Dar Chabab, the youth center, wouldn't let me work more than four hours a week. He was afraid I would just tumble dead if he pushed me further. But then, you know, I kept picking up more and more kids and doing more and more. And he saw that I was going to live through it, so he eased up. But people do not push old people to work at the same pace that the younger people do. MARTIN: What do you bring to the Peace Corps, do you think, that is different because you are older? CARTER: Well, I think it's an attitude. Younger people in our culture are raised to compete, so they're all trying to do as much as possible. And it's very restful for them to be around people who are not competing. So, you know, I think that what I bring is a kind of, you know, all I'm here is to model how to be old. I'm not here to, you know, be a world leader or accomplish impossible tasks. And I just want you to know that you can have a really good time in the Peace Corps when you're old. MARTIN: How much longer do you have on this tour? And would you extend or do another one? CARTER: I have one more year, and I'm not going to extend because I think my family would come and drag me off the continent of Africa if that happened. And I haven't made any plans about what I'm going to do when I come home. MARTIN: Well, I imagine it will be something big. Alice Carter, thank you so much for talking with us. CARTER: Oh, thank you. I really appreciate it. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:   You're about to hear from a titleholder. We called her up far away. And first things first - happy birthday, Alice. ALICE CARTER: Yeah.

At the U. S. naval base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, five men imprisoned there are accused of plotting the September 11 terrorist attacks. The military commission that is to try them meets  only infrequently. NPR's David Welna traveled to Guantanamo this weekend to cover the latest session of that court. He's with us now on the line to talk about where things stand. David, thanks for joining us. DAVID WELNA, BYLINE: Hi, Michel. MARTIN: So tell us a little bit about where you are right now. WELNA: Well, you know, I'm talking to you from a trailer inside a big old airplane hangar that's next to a big airfield that hasn't been used for decades. For the last 9 years, there's been a kind of tent city occupying that part of the airstrip. And that's where we reporters who cover these proceedings stay. The call it Camp Justice. MARTIN: So you were there a year ago. What's happened in the long story of putting these 9-11 defendants on trial? WELNA: Not much since then. There have been only two war court sessions for this case since I was here last February. A lot of the time has been spent over this past year arguing over the military judge's order that female guards not be used to escort these defendants to the courtroom since these men say their religion forbids touching any women not related to them. There have also been arguments over censorship of court transcripts. And like most of the nearly 4000 motions that have been filed so far in this case over nearly four years, none of these are directly related to the thrust of this proceeding, which is to execute those found guilty of plotting the 9-11 attacks. MARTIN: So what do we expect for this latest round of proceedings, the reason you're there? WELNA: You know, there are supposed to be nine days of court sessions over the next couple of weeks. And there's going to be a lot more wrangling over simply how to move forward. One of the defendants wants permission from the judge to fire his civilian lawyers, saying he can't trust anyone anymore. A defense lawyer may try to stop the whole proceeding because his interpreter has his top secret clearance taken away from him. But the main issue in this session will be the ongoing fight over how much information the prosecution should provide the defense team in its effort to keep these five men from being executed. A lot of that information is classified, and a lot of it has to do with the fact that they were tortured by the CIA, as a Senate report has already documented. MARTIN: So David, in the minute that we have left, given all of this, do we have any sense of when we'll see an actual trial of the accused 9-11 plotters? WELNA: Well, you know, I put that question to both the prosecution and the defense this weekend. The prosecution does not want to even guess, and the defense is estimating it'll be at least another five years before this even comes to trial. And in the meantime, President Obama wants to move this whole operation up to the United States and close Guantanamo, so lots of uncertainties lie ahead. MARTIN: And as the president has said he's - since the beginning of his administration has wanted to close the prison in Guantanamo. How many people remain there? WELNA: There are 91 captives still here in Guantanamo. That's down from more than 600 during the Bush administration. And almost all of them have been held here without charges for 14 years. Thirty-four of them have been certified by a parole-type board as eligible for transfer. But because most of them come from Yemen, it's been very difficult to find a place to send them. There are 10 people who are charged of the remaining detainees. The others, it's not clear what's going to happen to them. President Obama wants to move them to the United States, but that's currently forbidden by law. And Congress may be presented with a plan to do this this coming week, and it's certain to reject that. And so it's not clear how President Obama might proceed from there. MARTIN: That's NPR's David Welna, reporting to us from Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. David, thank you. WELNA: You're quite welcome.

A lot of that information is classified, and a lot of it has to do with the fact that they were tortured by the CIA, as a Senate report has already documented. MARTIN: So David, in the minute that we have left, given all of this, do we have any sense of when we'll see an actual trial of the accused 9-11 plotters? WELNA: Well, you know, I put that question to both the prosecution and the defense this weekend. The prosecution does not want to even guess, and the defense is estimating it'll be at least another five years before this even comes to trial. And in the meantime, President Obama wants to move this whole operation up to the United States and close Guantanamo, so lots of uncertainties lie ahead. MARTIN: And as the president has said he's - since the beginning of his administration has wanted to close the prison in Guantanamo. How many people remain there? WELNA: There are 91 captives still here in Guantanamo. That's down from more than 600 during the Bush administration. And almost all of them have been held here without charges for 14 years. Thirty-four of them have been certified by a parole-type board as eligible for transfer. But because most of them come from Yemen, it's been very difficult to find a place to send them. There are 10 people who are charged of the remaining detainees. The others, it's not clear what's going to happen to them. President Obama wants to move them to the United States, but that's currently forbidden by law. And Congress may be presented with a plan to do this this coming week, and it's certain to reject that. And so it's not clear how President Obama might proceed from there. MARTIN: That's NPR's David Welna, reporting to us from Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. David, thank you.

MARTIN: The subtitle of your book says this is the true story of how this couple, quote, \"defied their families and escaped an honor killing,\" which says a lot right off the bat. If you don't mind, could you just start by introducing us to these two young people? Who are they? How'd they meet? NORDLAND: Well, they grew up together, actually, in villages side-by-side. And they worked in fields that adjoined one another. Their families had fields right next to each other. They're both from potato farming families. And so they knew each other all their lives until she reached puberty and then was separated from all men that she was related to. And then they began a secret courtship that went on for a couple years before they finally got together. MARTIN: And it had to be secret because she is Tajik. He is Hazara. These are different ethnic groups, and they're from different sects of Islam. NORDLAND: That's right. And even - they did actually arrange for his father to ask her father in a formal way, but he rejected the idea on those grounds. And then they carried on secretly and eventually tried to get together for real. And she had to flee and was put in a women's shelter for her protection, which is where I found her. MARTIN: So, as you say, they - she gets put in this women's shelter. They have to essentially escape - take some major risks and flee - run away from their families because their families don't approve. Her family, in particular, has threatened her life. How did you catch wind of this, and what was your first interaction with them? NORDLAND: Well, the first story I did for the Times was when she was in the shelter, and I interviewed her there and then interviewed Ali, her lover, separately. And I thought that was going to be end of it. They would just be - you know, eventually she'd be given back to her family. The judges were trying to get her out of the shelter anyway - and even though her family, in open court, had threatened to kill her for what she was doing. And - but she surprised everybody by escaping the shelter, eloping with Ali and running off into the mountains. And Afghanistan's not a great to hide if you're, like, two young people with very little resources. And it was pretty clear they - after a couple weeks, they'd be found. And so I kind of went looking for them as well. And. . . MARTIN: And what were your motives for looking for them? NORDLAND: There was a great story at that point, just a great story. And readers - the first story I did on them had kind of touched a chord, and I was deluged with reader mail. And then when I finally caught up to them and wrote about that and their continued flight - plus, we had video and pictures of them together and they were very kind of photogenic as well. I think that helped. And we were just deluged with interest. I've never been - had so much reaction to a story I've worked on ever. MARTIN: You write about this a lot in the book, the conflict that you faced because you became personally involved with these two. They needed help. They didn't seemingly have anyone. At what point in your relationship with them did you start to think - I have gotten too personally involved? NORDLAND: Yeah. They kind of - they were kind of a touching couple. They're really kind of sweet kids - 18 and 21 and completely clueless, you know. All they had going for them is that they knew that they loved each other, and that was it. And they were just running on love and empty, you know, no money or anything else. And that was just very touching. And then also, because I was pursuing them myself and because I'm a foreigner, I needed an entourage of people for my protection. And we also had a video crew with us as well as a photographer. We were this big kind of traveling roadshow. . . MARTIN: Yeah. NORDLAND: . . . That was drawing the attention of everybody around. And it was pretty clear at some point that if I did find them, I was going to help other people find them because it wouldn't take long for people to figure out what some foreigner was doing in this area that hadn't seen a foreigner in a year. And this. . . MARTIN: So the more attention you paid to them, there was a risk that you were. . . NORDLAND: Very much so. MARTIN: . . . Exposing them. NORDLAND: It was really a conundrum. And then I did catch up to them. And they were - I caught up to them just as they were being evicted from the house they were hiding in. The owner wanted them to go. They had no car, no means. And, you know, I was pretty much their only option at that point. MARTIN: You ended up even donating money. You were donating money from listener - from your viewers who felt invested in their story. But you yourself ended up giving them cash. NORDLAND: Yeah. Readers were begging me to give the money to help them and to do whatever we possibly could. And - but that money hadn't reached me at that point because I was trying to find a way for them to do that in a, you know, sort of regular way like a women's group that could receive the money or something. So at that point, I just gave them some money out of my own pocket and put them in my car and gave them a getaway car, basically, and stepped way over the line of, you know, journalist and participant. MARTIN: At one point in the book, you say that there's a connection here between helping Ali and Zakia - there's a parallel between the Western aid that flooded into Afghanistan after the U. S. invasion. You write both just weren't sustainable. Did you worry that you were unfairly raising their expectations for what you could do? NORDLAND: I did. But on the other hand, you know, they would have been dead long before if I hadn't intervened. And I think that's so - she would have definitely, and I think that's pretty clear. So yes, that's true. And I've been criticized for that, and I think, you know, it's a fair point. But it overlooks the fact that they had no other prospects. There weren't any Afghans who were going to step in and save them, you know, at that point. . . MARTIN: Yeah. NORDLAND: . . . Or who had the capacity to. But I had the capacity to. And you know, I kind of felt like you might feel if you're a photographer and you happened on a car crash scene, you know. Are you going to render first aid first or take the picture first? And I think there's only one thing that you can do as a human being in cases like that. You just have to put aside those journalistic scruples. MARTIN: Yeah. We're getting some questions in through Twitter. Obviously, people want to know - where are they now? And what is the relationship like with their families? NORDLAND: Yeah. They're still in hiding in Bamiyan. They tried unsuccessfully to flee the country then she got pregnant. So they decided it wasn't worth trying to flee the country while she was pregnant. They went back to Bamiyan. They're pretty much in hiding in the family home. I mean, people know where they are. But they don't go out at all because they're safe in their village probably. But if they went out, they'd be in trouble.

I\u2019m Terry Gross. What do the drug cartels have in common with Wal-Mart and McDonald\u2019s? Journalist Tom Wainwright discovered the cartels\u2019 business models have several things in common with the business models of big box stores and fast food chains. He learned that and more when he decided to cover the global drug industry as if it were a business like any other business. He describes his new book \u201cNarconomics\u201d as a business manual for drug lords and also a blueprint for how to defeat them. He describes himself as a not-very-brave who has covered the most exotic and brutal industry on earth. He became the Mexico correspondent for The Economist in 2010 and spent the next three years covering that country as well as parts of Central and South America. He\u2019s also reported on legalized marijuana in the U. S. and on the Dark Web, the black market side of the Internet, where illegal drugs are sold. He\u2019s now the Britain editor for The Economist. Tom Wainwright, welcome to FRESH AIR. So why did you want to report on the drug industry as if it were a global business - like, a legit global business? TOM WAINWRIGHT: Well, I should say, first of all, the book isn\u2019t trying to legitimize the industry in any way. It\u2019s device for looking at and, hopefully, understanding better this business. But the reason that I first of all got into it, really, was that I was sent to Mexico with The Economist. And I was covering a whole range of things, and I found myself writing about business some weeks - like, let\u2019s say, the car business or the oil business or the tequila business or something like that. And then increasingly I found, very often, I was often, in other weeks, writing about the drug war, which, at the time, was a really big news story in Mexico. This was during the presidency of Felipe Calderon and, later, Enrique Pina Nieto. And the murder rate in Mexico was going through the roof. And it was the story. And I found that, you know, one week, I'd be writing about the car business, and the next week, I'd be writing about the drugs business. And I gradually came to see that the two actually were perhaps more similar than people normally recognize. GROSS: So one of the comparisons you make is between the narco supply chain and the Wal-Mart (laughter) supply chain. Make that comparison for us. WAINWRIGHT: Well, it sounds kind of outrageous, but the reason that I got to thinking about this was that I was looking at the supply chain of cocaine. I went down to Bolivia, and I went to visit some of the terraces down there in the Andes where the coca leaf is grown. So the coca leaf is the raw ingredient for cocaine. And all of the world's cocaine is grown down there in the Andes, in either Bolivia, Colombia or Peru. And so I went down there, and I read about all the incredible work that's being done down there to try to disrupt the cocaine supply line. And you'll have seen footage, probably, of airplanes and helicopters dumping tons of weed-killer on these Andean terraces in Colombia, for instance. And they've done lots of work of this, and they've done a, you know, fairly effective job of making it harder to grow coca leaf. They destroyed hundreds of thousands of hectares over the years. And it's made the lives of cartels more difficult, on the surface at least. And yet, I looked at the price of cocaine in the United States, and it's hardly budged. You can go back decades, and you know, the price has remained roughly $100 per pure gram. GROSS: And part of the rationale for destroying the crops is that it drives up the price of the coca leaves, therefore driving up the price of drugs, therefore making it less affordable for people, therefore being effective in the war on drugs. Do I have that right? WAINWRIGHT: Well, that's the - yeah. That's the idea. . . GROSS: That's the idea. WAINWRIGHT: . . . At least. An economist would assume that if you cut supply, as you say, then the price will go up, other things being equal. And yet, this hasn't happened. So I was kind of intrigued by this. It seems like a puzzle. And I looked into it, and it turns out that if you compare areas in Colombia, for instance, where crop eradication has gone on with areas where it hasn't the price of coca leaf - the wholesale price of coca leaf doesn't really change. And the theory is that the cartels in the area have what economists call a monopsony, so that's like a monopoly on buying in the area. In other words, they're the only ones who buy the products in the area. And this rang a bell with me because it's something that people very often say about Wal-Mart. They say that in certain industries, Wal-Mart is effectively the only buyer in the industry. And so if there's some disruption to supply - let's say the harvest fails for apples or something like that - apple growers aren't able to increase their prices because Wal-Mart is the only buyer. And they say well, sorry, but this our price. And if you don't want to sell to us, well, tough. And so the sellers have to carry on selling it at the same price as before. And it seemed that something similar might be going on in the cocaine industry. And sure enough, when you look at the price data, that's exactly what you see. There's no difference in the price in areas where eradication has taken place and where eradication has not taken place. And according to the analysis that's being done, it looks as if the reason for this is that the cartels that buy the drug are the monopsony buyers - the only buyers in each area. GROSS: So the cartels aren't, like, learning from Wal-Mart. It's just that that's the way both Wal-Mart and the cartels operate. WAINWRIGHT: Yeah, that's right. I don't think there's a kind of conscious decision where the cartels have gone out there and thought - hey, let's be exactly like Wal-Mart. But it just - it helps to explain why this strategy, which on the surface, as I say, looks quite effective - you know, governments have been able to disrupt the supply of cocoa leaf quite well. It helps to explain why it actually has had very little effect on the price. And I mean, that's not the only reason. When you look at the economics of the supply chain, you begin to see why actually, even if you could increase the price of that coca leaf, it's doubtful that it would have very much impact on the final price of cocaine in the U. S. or in Europe. Because to make, for instance, a kilo of cocaine, you need about a ton of coca leaf, and that ton, once it's all dried out, in a country like Colombia, it will fetch perhaps $400. Now, the kilo of cocaine in the United States will fetch about a $100,000. And so if you - let's say you're incredibly successful in managing to raise the price of coca leaf and you manage to double it to $800. If you then manage to transfer all of that extra cost onto the consumer, that final kilo of cocaine is only going to cost now $100,400. In other words, you can double the price of coca leaf and you increase the price of the final product, cocaine, by less than 1 percent. And I sometimes say it's a bit like - imagine if you were trying to increase the price artwork and you decided that you would do this by driving up the cost of paint. You know, you wouldn't expect it to have a very big effect because the cost of paint is such a tiny, tiny part of the overall price of the finished product. It's just the same with cocaine. We're putting all this effort into raising the price of coca leaf, when, in fact, that's only a small part of the cost of the final product. GROSS: In keeping with the theme of how cartels compare to legit businesses and how they operate - franchising (laughter). Like, some of the cartels franchise. You compare them to McDonald's in this respect. And an example that you give is the Zetas. So who are the Zetas? And how did they franchise the brand? WAINWRIGHT: Well, the Zetas are one of Mexico's biggest drug cartels, and they have a reputation for being one of the nastiest ones. So when you see pictures of people who've been beheaded or hung up from bridges, you know, these are often the guys who are responsible. And while I was in Mexico, the Zetas expanded more quickly than any other cartel. It was extraordinary. They originally came from the northeast of Mexico, but within a very short space of time, they spread across all of Mexico and, in fact, down into Central America as well. And so I got thinking about how they'd done this. And when you look at the way that they spread, it seems that what they do is that they go to local areas and they find out who the local criminals are - the people who do the drug dealing and the extortion and all the other kinds of crime - and they offer them a deal. They say - OK, you can use our brand. You can call yourself the Zetas, just like us. And they give them, believe it or not, baseball caps with embroidered logos, and they give them T-shirts with their logo on, and they train them in how to use weapons sometimes. And in return, the local criminals give the Zetas a share of all the money that they get from their criminal activity. So in other words, it's exactly like the kind of franchising model that many other well-known companies use. And it comes with all the same advantages and disadvantages. I mean, one of the big advantages is that it's allowed the Zetas to grow much more quickly. One of the disadvantages, though - and this is something that you often see in the legitimate franchising business - is that the franchisees often start to quarrel among each other. And the trouble is that the interests of these franchisees, the local criminals, aren't very well aligned with the interests of the main company. Because as far as the main company is concerned - and this applies whether it's the Zetas or McDonald's - if you've got more branches - more franchises - in a local area, that means more income for the main company because they take their money as a slice of the income of the local franchisees. But the local franchisees have totally different motives. They want to be, if possible, the only ones in the area. They want as few branches as possible. And so you've had, very often, cases of franchisees suing the main brand over what they call encroachment, in other words, when the main brand has too many branches in the same area. GROSS: So just to back up a bit - you mentioned - so, like, with the Zetas that they gave out -what? - like T-shirts and hats with their logo on it with, like, the Zeta (laughter) - the Zeta name or the Zeta logo? I mean, the Zetas are a drug cartel. Is it really OK to be walking around with their logo on your T-shirt? Doesn't that kind of get in the face of the police? WAINWRIGHT: You'd think it might, wouldn't you? Yeah. I mean, it depends where you are. I think in some parts of Mexico, that would be a problem. I mean, not all of Mexico is quite as chaotic as what you see on the news. And certainly, if you walk around Mexico City, it's much like walking around a city in - you know, in the United States or in Europe - or at least in the kind of rich very center of the town. But in other bits of Mexico, that's not the case. I mean, you can - sometimes on sale in local markets in cities, including, indeed, actually on the edge of Mexico City, you can see pirate DVDs for sale which have the brand on them. The - you know, it's like a - zeta, I should say, in Spanish, just means the letter Z, or zed, as we say in Britain. And people in northern Mexico even complain that sometimes if you go to a bar, you'll find bottles of whiskey which have this letter Z on them because the cartel - the Zetas - have got into all of these different types of business. And really, like any other big business - like any multinational - they're starting to diversify because they've found that - well, lo, there's plenty of money to be had in drugs. You know, there are lots of other opportunities out there. GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is Tom Wainwright. He's the author of the new bookmark \"Narconomics,\" which is a business reporter's look at how the drug cartels in Mexico and South America actually operate financially - you know, what their supply side is like, what their business model is.

He's the Britain editor of The Economist and The Economist's former Mexico correspondent. You write that cocaine starts to become really valuable a little further down the supply chain, not where the coca leaves are grown but further down the supply chain at the U. S. border. It's probably an obvious question, but why is that an important place in the supply chain? WAINWRIGHT: Well, it's a really good question actually because I think very often, when we're reporting on the drug war, people forget that the drug changes value as it moves down the supply chain. And very often, you see these stories where the DEA or the Mexican authorities intercept a large quantity of drugs. And it's reported that these drugs have a street value of however many million dollars. But often, when you look more closely at how much these drugs are worth, you get a slightly different kind of number. And it looks rather less impressive. And just to give one example, when I arrived in Mexico, soon after I got there, there was this incredible finding in Tijuana, where the Mexican police found this amazing stash of marijuana. It was more than a hundred tons of the stuff, all in this warehouse on the edge of Tijuana. And it was reported in some corners of the press that all of this represented a blow against organized crime to the tune of about half a billion dollars. It was nearly $500 million, some people said. And I thought about this. And I thought, you know, can it really be that much? That's a huge amount of money because the drugs business is big enough, but it's not that big. And how could any cartel withstand a kind of defeat like that? So I looked into it a bit more, and it turned out that the way that this calculation had been done was using retail prices in the states. I mean, they just figured a gram of marijuana in American might cost, you know, maybe about, say, $5 as a conservative estimate. And so a hundred tons multiplied by that amount gives you this incredible total. But in fact, this is crazy. I mean, imagine if you did that with another product, like, say, coffee. And you said, well, a cup of coffee in the states in Starbucks costs - what is it? - two or $3 or something lie that. And in that cup of coffee, you've got one or two grams of coffee granules. So that must mean that the kilo of coffee intercepted in Colombia is worth $2,000. And of course it's not. I mean, we know that that's absurd. And the reason that coffee increases in price is because the value of coffee is in - let's say if you have it in a cafe like Starbucks - it's in the fact that it's being served to you. It's in the fact that Starbucks has to pay rent on its premises. It has to transport it around the world and so on. That's why it increases in value. And so it's just the same with a drug like cocaine or marijuana. In Mexico, that drug there in a warehouse, it has a value. But it's not worth anything like as much as it's worth on the streets in the United States. And in fact, in Mexico, the wholesale price of cannabis or marijuana is much less. It's like $80 per kilo. So that stash, which supposedly was worth half a billion dollars, was probably worth about maybe $10 million, which, you know, is not nothing. But it's about 2 percent of the amount that people originally thought. GROSS: So because the border crossing is so important, because the value of the drugs increase across the border, you say that's why there are so many cartel wars at border towns that have legit border crossings. Give us a sense of the kind of wars that are going on in the border crossing towns. WAINWRIGHT: Well, you're right that when you see these reports about violence in Mexico, it's very often taking place either along the border or in cities like Ciudad Juarez or Reynosa or Tijuana, places like that - or occasionally in port cities, like Acapulco or Lazaro Cardenas, and places like this. And the reason really is that these are the kind of pinch points. They're a limited number of places at which you can transport cocaine or marijuana or, indeed, anything else into the U. S. And so if you want to smuggle large quantities of drugs into the states, you really have to control one of these cities. That's why the cartels fight so brutally for control of these particular places. It's why you see in Ciudad Juarez, in the past at least, a murder rate which was perhaps 200 times the murder rate in the U. K. , whereas in Mexico City, you see a murder rate which is - you know, it's higher than here in Britain. But it's comparable with some cities in North America. GROSS: You say that the cartels have personnel and HR issues that are similar to the issues that legitimate businesses face and that you've spoken to cartel leaders who sound like CEOs. Who have you spoken to? WAINWRIGHT: Well, this was a guy that I had in mind in particular who I went to see in El Salvador. And he's a guy called Carlos Mojica Lechuga, who is the leader of one of the two big street gangs in El Salvador. There are two of them, one called Barrio Dieciocho, or the 18th Street Gang, as most people call it in English, and the other, called the Mara Salvatrucha. And both of these are effectively transnational corporations, really. I mean, they make their livings dealing drugs and with extortion, principally. Those are the two main business lines that they have. And so I thought it would be interesting to go and speak to this guy and find out how he ran his company. So I went to see him. And he's in jail at the moment, which doesn't seem to be stopping him from running his business in any way. So I went to see him in this prison in El Salvador. And apparently by the standards of El Salvador, this is classified as a medium security prison. But it didn't look like one. I mean, outside you had soldiers with machine guns behind nests of sandbags, and. . . Anyway, I went in there and handed over my telephone and all the rest of it and went in. And they brought this guy in. And he's - just to describe him, you may have seen pictures of these El Salvador gangsters. They're the ones who very often have tattoos from - literally from head to toe. And sure enough, this guy Carlos had a great big tattoo going across his forehead, saying in Spanish, in memory of my mother. And all over his body, he had these tattoos with the number 18 featuring prominently, which was the name of his gang. And so we sat down, and we started talking business. And it really turned out that a lot of his complaints were just like the kind of complaints that I'd heard many times before from other businesspeople. He complained about managing his staff. He complained about competition with his rivals. He complained about, you know, his image in the international media. It was really strangely reminiscent of speaking to a kind of frustrated, mid-level manager. And sure enough, the kind of tactics that his gang is employing are not so different from the ones that other firms employ. And when I was there, the main sort of business strategy that he was experimenting with was a temporary truce, the kind of collusion with his archrivals, this other gang, the Mara Salvatrucha that I mentioned. And the two gangs had decided at the time to stop murdering each other, which they'd been doing a lot, because they thought it would be better for business. And it had the most incredible effect. I mean, San Salvador, the capital of El Salvador, at one point was the world's most murderous city. And after the gang signed this truce and decided to collude, the murder rate fell by about two-thirds overnight. And it was - by that stage, it was lower than in some cities in the states. GROSS: What did they collude on that enabled them to make this truce and still feel like they were getting what they wanted from their business? WAINWRIGHT: Well, the key difference, really, between the situation in Mexico, for instance, and the situation in El Salvador is that whereas in Mexico, the number of border crossing points to the states is so limited that the cartels really have to compete with each other, in El Salvador, they have a slightly different model where really, they just control territory in the country of El Salvador. And there's plenty of that. And so they divide it up among themselves. So in this case, the Barrio Dieciocho was quite happy to control some parts of the country while the Mara Salvatrucha controlled other bits. And they found that if they left each other alone and effectively ran small, local monopolies, they were able to get higher profits than if they competed across the whole country. In Mexico, it's slightly different because controlling a city like Ciudad Juarez is so valuable that no cartel is currently willing to cede it to any other. It makes sense for them, from a business point of view, to compete over that particular location. And that's why the level of violence in Juarez at the time was so high, whereas in El Salvador at the time, they were willing to collude and sign this truce. GROSS: My guest is journalist Tom Wainwright, author of the new book \"Narconomics. \" After a short break, we'll talk about how it would affect drug cartels financially if drugs were legalized and regulated in the U. S. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross, back with Tom Wainwright, author of the new book \"Narconomics\" in which he writes about the global industry as if it were a business like any other business. And he finds surprising similarities between the cartels' business models and the business models of big-box stores and fast food franchises. Wainwright started research on the book when he was the Mexico-based correspondent for The Economist. He's now the magazine's Britain editor. When we left off, we were talking about an interview he did with a cartel leader. So getting back to the interview that you did with the cartel leader who was in an El Salvador prison - it's dangerous to write about the drug wars because a lot of the cartels attack journalists. There's so many journalists who've been murdered. I think that's particularly true in Mexico. So did you feel like you were taking a risk to speak to this guy who's tattooed from head to foot and is a cartel leader? He's in prison, but he's still running the cartel. Did you feel like that put you at risk? WAINWRIGHT: Well, I felt kind of nervous to say the least. Yeah, I mean - (laughter) I went into the prison and, you know, they showed me into this cell. And they took the guy in and took off his handcuffs and shut the door behind us, and we were the only two in there. So I - yeah, I was kind of nervous about that. That meeting turned out fine. And in the end, actually, he was kind of intrigued by my line of questioning. I think he wasn't really used to being interviewed as though he were a businessman. And by the end, he was telling me all about his admiration for the criminal gangs of East London who he told me he'd always greatly admired as fellow entrepreneurs. But I think, in terms of the threat to journalists, it's very real. But it's worth just making clear that, really, the journalists who undergo the really serious risks are the Mexican journalists. I mean, the - those are the men and women who have been killed in horrible numbers in recent years. In the past decade, more than 60 journalists have been murdered in Mexico. And really, it's the Mexican journalists that bear the brunt of this, partly because - I think - the level of impunity for murdering a local journalist is greater than it would be for murdering a foreign one and also because it's often the local journalists that do the kinds of stories that hurt the cartels most. They're the ones that name the local police officers and the local politicians who are involved in corruption on a very local level, whereas the foreign journalists like me, on the whole, tend to do, kind of, bigger picture stories which are perhaps less in danger of naming and shaming, kind of, local people on a very, sort of, micro level. GROSS: So, you know, in talking about the pressures on journalists and the dangers that journalists risk, especially in Mexico, if they write about business. I mean, there's so many reporters who have been murdered by the drug cartels. And you write that sometimes, the cartels want you to shut up and not report anything related to the drug wars - any of the murders or anything. And other times, they want publicity, and they want you to report on it. And sometimes one cartel wants you to report on things, and another cartel doesn't. You quote, in your book, an editorial that was on the front page of the El Diario De Juarez - which is, I guess, a daily newspaper in a Juarez? WAINWRIGHT: That's right. Yeah. GROSS: And this was in 2010. It's on page 88. Would you read that editorial for us? WAINWRIGHT: Well, the title of this editorial was simply, \"What Do You Want From Us? And it went like this. It said - (reading) gentlemen of the different organizations that are fighting over the territory of Juarez, we bring to your attention that we are communicators, not mind readers. For that reason, as information workers, we want you to explain what you want from us - what you want us to publish or stop publishing - so that we know what to stick to. You are, at the moment, the de facto authorities in this city because the legally instituted powers have been able to do nothing to prevent our colleagues from continuing to fall. GROSS: So - that was pretty brave, no? Direct message to the cartels and so sarcastic. Oh, be clearer what you want. You want us to write about you or not? And how are we to know which is which? WAINWRIGHT: Well, I think they were at their wits' end. This was published just after the latest murder of one of their journalists. You know, it wasn't the first by any means, and I think they didn't know what to do. And in a way, although the editorial was addressed to the cartels, I think the real audience perhaps was the government. I think this was really a message to the government saying - look, you guys are doing such a hopeless job of maintaining security in this city that we're actually having to bargain with the cartels over what we can write. And it had the desired effect. This article was very widely reported in Mexico and, indeed, outside Mexico as well. It made quite a big story. So I think, probably, the reporters had in mind a bigger audience than just the cartel members. But it's true that the journalists very often do end up communicating with the cartels and covering news in a way that the cartels want. And a good example of this was - when I was in Juarez, I was on a visit to the morgue there - the city morgue. And I spoke to one of the pathologists there, and he gave me a piece of advice in Juarez. He said never go outside in Juarez at quarter to 6 in the afternoon. That's the most dangerous time of day. And I said - well, why is that? You know, I would've thought the most dangerous time would have been late at night or, you know, just before dawn or something like that. And he said no, quarter to 6 is the most dangerous time, and it's because that's 15 minutes before the evening news bulletin. And very often, the cartels murder people at exactly that time because they know that if there's a murder then - at quarter to 6, all the news reporters will go to cover it. And there'll be there live, and it will be the main story on the evening news. And very often, that's what they want. They want to send a message to their rivals, or they want to send a message to the public that they're the dominant cartel in town. And so, they're so cynical that they actually time their murders around the news bulletins. And quarter to 6, this man told me, is the most dangerous time to be out. GROSS: Wow. (Laughter) Did you take that advice and not go out then? WAINWRIGHT: Yeah. I cowered in my hotel room at quarter to 6. (LAUGHTER)GROSS: Well, in one city you were going to - I forget what city it was - you had, like, a GPS tracking device that was secretly hidden in your sock or something. . . WAINWRIGHT: Oh, yeah. GROSS: . . . So that somebody could be aware of where you were - in case you were in danger, they'd know where to find you. And then you get off the plane and find that the tracking device isn't working (laughter). So, you're. . . WAINWRIGHT: Yeah, that wasn't a great moment. GROSS: Yeah. So you're left alone without any kind of hope of somebody knowing where you are and if you're safe or not. What was the assignment you had given yourself that you continued to do in spite of the fact that the GPS went dead? WAINWRIGHT: Well, this was when I was going to Ciudad Juarez. And it was in, I believe, 2011, which I wasn't to know at the time, but this was to turn out to be the most violent year in Juarez, when the murder really hit its peak. And I was just going there to try to figure what was going on - to try to figure out why the violence was suddenly so high in this one city, why it had risen so quickly. And I hadn't been to the city before. And so before I went, I went to speak to this security consultant in Mexico City, and just said doesn't look - you know, how dangerous is this? Am I going to be OK? And he looked kind of - a bit nervous about the fact that I was going. You know, he could tell that I hadn't been there before and didn't really know the city very well. And so he gave me this tracking device and said - well, look - you know, hide this on your person. And that way, if you go missing, then we'll be able to figure out where you are. Or at least, you know, if you hide it in your sock, he said, then at least we'll know where your right leg is. . . (LAUGHTER)WAINWRIGHT: . . . Which was slightly. . . GROSS: Yeah, that's encouraging (laughter). WAINWRIGHT: . . . Slightly intimidating. So I took it with me. And you know, I go there, and the plane landed. And I went into the bathroom in the airport and tried to switch this thing on, and the light didn't come on. And so I was left there without this tracking thing, but I decided to get on with it anyway. And I just called back to my office constantly to let them know, you know, that I was emerging from one meeting and going into another. And it just had the feel of the city under siege. And I was going through the city with a taxi driver, and it was a boiling hot day. But I noticed everybody had their windows very firmly rolled up. And, you know, people were just very, very unhappy about the idea of being out in public at all. And another thing I noticed was that the taxi driver allowed plenty of space when we were stopping at traffic lights. He allowed lots of space between us and the car in front. And this was kind of strange because in Mexico City, the driving is quite aggressive. You know, people aren't always terribly polite with their driving, but in Juarez everybody was being very, very courteous and leaving lots of space. And I asked this taxi driver - what's going on? You know - why are people driving so carefully and leaving so much space between each other?  And he said well, it's because very often, at these stoplights - at traffic lights - it's where you have executions. It's where you have these shootouts. Very often, one cartel will come up to a member of another at a traffic light and shoot him dead in the car where it's a place where they can't get out very easily. So the reason he was leaving plenty of space was so that if a shootout began, he would be able to maneuver out of the way. And it was things like that that were extraordinary. As I saw, this was just over the border from the States. And it was really a city that felt like a city war. GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is Tom Wainwright. He's the author of the new book \"Narconomics,\" which looks at the drug cartels as if they were legit businesses to try to understand - what's their supply chain like? You know, how do they make their profits? How do they keep people in line? What are their HR problems? And Wainwright is the Britain editor of The Economist and was based in Mexico for The Economist when he did a lot of the reporting for this book. Let's take a short break then we'll talk some more. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is Tom Wainwright. He is the Britain editor of The Economist, the former Mexico Bureau chief for The Economist. And he is the author of the new book \"Narconomics,\" which is a business reporter's look at how drug cartels really operate and make their profits. You examine at the end of the book what it might look like if the U. S. legalized and regulated drugs like marijuana and heroin and cocaine. How do you think the legalization and regulation of those drugs would affect the Mexican and South American cartels and all the crime that goes along with that? WAINWRIGHT: Well, we're already starting to see an impact on the cartels from the legalization of the marijuana business. Some of those cartels rely - or in the past, at least relied quite heavily on marijuana for their income. Some of them got about half of their income from cannabis. So in that sense, it's hitting them pretty badly. And I think the same thing probably would be true with respect to other drugs. There's an interesting example underway in Switzerland where they've legalized heroin, which sounds crazy. But it's worth making clear that when they legalized it, they haven't put it on sale in the way that marijuana is on sale in Denver. They've just legalized it by allowing doctors to prescribe it to people who are already addicted. And it's had quite an interesting effect there because many of the people who are addicted to heroin in Switzerland and indeed in other countries are people who deal the drug because if you're addicted to this drug, it's a very expensive habit. And for many people, the only way they can afford it is to deal it on the side. And so in Switzerland, what they found is that by taking those very heavy using addicts into treatment, they've stopped them from dealing the drug because now they get their own drug free of charge from their doctors. And because they're no longer out their on the streets dealing the drug, the number of new users has dropped dramatically. And so in Switzerland, funnily enough they found that since they legalized it in this very, very limited, restricted, controlled way, the number of new users actually has fallen quite a lot. And of course, the illegal supply has dried up almost entirely because the supply now is run by the government. So I think - I don't think there's any good way of controlling the drug problem because these are for the most part harmful drugs which are going to do people much good. But it seems to me that what I've seen is that the least bad way to control them is for governments to get more involved in the business themselves because the choice that I think we face isn't really a choice between a world without drugs and a world with drugs. I think the choice we face really is between a world where drugs are controlled by governments and prescribed by pharmacists and doctors and a world where they're dealt by the mafia. And given that choice, I think the former sounds more appealing. GROSS: So when you're talking about regulating a drug like heroin, you're talking about doctors prescribing it to help people who are already addicted get off of it. WAINWRIGHT: Absolutely, yeah. And the thing to understand about legalization and regulation is that there's a whole spectrum of regulation that you can get involved in. You can regulate something very, very lightly if you want, like, say, the way caffeine is regulated, which is to say not really at all, or you can regulate it very, very heavily in the way that something like, say, Valium is regulated. It's controlled more strictly by doctors. And I think the harder the drug, the more damaging the drug, the more you would want to go along that spectrum towards the drugs which are more heavily regulated and dished out by doctors. GROSS: You also questioned where we put our priority in terms of trying to stop the drug trade and where do we put our money. And a lot of that money goes towards law enforcement and toward the destruction of crops at the source. You question whether that's the best use of money. What's the model you'd like to see financially, as a business reporter, for the use of money to try to stop the drug cartels and to also try to stop more people from getting addicted? WAINWRIGHT: Well, I think if you look at the way that we fight the war on drugs at the moment, all of the attention or the great majority of the attention is on the supply side of the business, which is to say the smuggling side of it, the growing side of it, the trafficking side of it. And so governments have plowed lots of money and expended lots resources and indeed given up many lives of police officers in trying to down the production of drugs like cocaine in South America. What I suspect they might have more luck doing is actually looking at the demand side of the business - i. e. trying to treat addicts, more trying to educate people more about cutting down on their drug use. And there's some good evidence on this, actually. There was a good study a few years ago where a think-tank did an investigation into the effect of spending a million dollars on trying to stop cocaine consumption in the States. And they compared the effects of spending that million dollars at different stages in the business - so in South America, on the way to the States, within the U. S. , on educating people in schools and so on. And what they found was that for every million dollars spent on trying to reduce cocaine consumption by intercepting it in South America, you cocaine consumption in the States by about 10 kilograms. But for every million dollars that you spend in the States on drug treatment for people who are already addicted, you cut consumption by about a hundred kilograms. So it's 10 times more effective - you get 10 times more bang for your buck, if you'd like. And I think this just suggests that that's where the real wins are to be had. Everything suggests that all of the money being spent on trying to reduce drug use by interrupting the supply has gone about as far as it can go. And as I was saying earlier, the economics of the supply chain mean that even if you do succeed in increasing the price of coca leaf in South America, it doesn't have very much impact on the price of cocaine in the States because that coca leaf makes up such a small part of the overall final price, whereas if you do tackle the drug nearer its consumers and particularly if you tackle the demand side of the business, you have a better chance of both driving down the price because the lower the demand is, the less the cartels are going to be able to charge for their product and reducing the amount of consumed. So that seems to be the best way to tackle the business on two fronts. GROSS: But you point out in times of, like, budget crises - and we always seem to be trapped in budget crises - that the money is cut in treatment programs, prison reform. And you think those are often, like, the wrong places to cut because that's what can really help cut down on addiction. WAINWRIGHT: I think that's right. And people are understandably unwilling to spend money on things like prisons because prisons are where the very worst people in society go. But very often, actually, by economizing on things like that, you let yourself in for much, much higher costs later down the line. I mean, if you have a prisoner in jail and you neglect to give him or her the training that that person needs to get a job on the way out once they're out of jail, then you greatly increase the chances that they're going to go back to jail. And keeping someone in prison is a ludicrously expensive way to treat them. It's a great, great cost. It costs more to put someone in prison for a year in the States then it does to send them to the most elite boarding school here in England. I mean, it's a very, very expensive way to attack the problem. GROSS: Well, Tom Wainwright, thank you for the reporting, and thank you for talking with us. WAINWRIGHT: Thank you very much. GROSS: Tom Wainwright is the author of the new book \"Narconomics. \" After a short break, rock critic Ken Tucker will review the debut album by Paul Westerberg and Juliana Hatfield, who have formed a duo called The I Don't Cares. This is FRESH AIR. TERRY GROSS, HOST:  This is FRESH AIR. I\u2019m Terry Gross. What do the drug cartels have in common with Wal-Mart and McDonald\u2019s? Journalist Tom Wainwright discovered the cartels\u2019 business models have several things in common with the business models of big box stores and fast food chains. He learned that and more when he decided to cover the global drug industry as if it were a business like any other business. He describes his new book \u201cNarconomics\u201d as a business manual for drug lords and also a blueprint for how to defeat them. He describes himself as a not-very-brave who has covered the most exotic and brutal industry on earth. He became the Mexico correspondent for The Economist in 2010 and spent the next three years covering that country as well as parts of Central and South America. He\u2019s also reported on legalized marijuana in the U. S. and on the Dark Web, the black market side of the Internet, where illegal drugs are sold. He\u2019s now the Britain editor for The Economist. Tom Wainwright, welcome to FRESH AIR. So why did you want to report on the drug industry as if it were a global business - like, a legit global business? TOM WAINWRIGHT: Well, I should say, first of all, the book isn\u2019t trying to legitimize the industry in any way. It\u2019s device for looking at and, hopefully, understanding better this business. But the reason that I first of all got into it, really, was that I was sent to Mexico with The Economist. And I was covering a whole range of things, and I found myself writing about business some weeks - like, let\u2019s say, the car business or the oil business or the tequila business or something like that. And then increasingly I found, very often, I was often, in other weeks, writing about the drug war, which, at the time, was a really big news story in Mexico. This was during the presidency of Felipe Calderon and, later, Enrique Pina Nieto. And the murder rate in Mexico was going through the roof. And it was the story. And I found that, you know, one week, I'd be writing about the car business, and the next week, I'd be writing about the drugs business. And I gradually came to see that the two actually were perhaps more similar than people normally recognize. GROSS: So one of the comparisons you make is between the narco supply chain and the Wal-Mart (laughter) supply chain. Make that comparison for us. WAINWRIGHT: Well, it sounds kind of outrageous, but the reason that I got to thinking about this was that I was looking at the supply chain of cocaine. I went down to Bolivia, and I went to visit some of the terraces down there in the Andes where the coca leaf is grown. So the coca leaf is the raw ingredient for cocaine. And all of the world's cocaine is grown down there in the Andes, in either Bolivia, Colombia or Peru. And so I went down there, and I read about all the incredible work that's being done down there to try to disrupt the cocaine supply line. And you'll have seen footage, probably, of airplanes and helicopters dumping tons of weed-killer on these Andean terraces in Colombia, for instance. And they've done lots of work of this, and they've done a, you know, fairly effective job of making it harder to grow coca leaf. They destroyed hundreds of thousands of hectares over the years. And it's made the lives of cartels more difficult, on the surface at least. And yet, I looked at the price of cocaine in the United States, and it's hardly budged. You can go back decades, and you know, the price has remained roughly $100 per pure gram. GROSS: And part of the rationale for destroying the crops is that it drives up the price of the coca leaves, therefore driving up the price of drugs, therefore making it less affordable for people, therefore being effective in the war on drugs. Do I have that right? WAINWRIGHT: Well, that's the - yeah. That's the idea. . . GROSS: That's the idea. WAINWRIGHT: . . . At least. An economist would assume that if you cut supply, as you say, then the price will go up, other things being equal. And yet, this hasn't happened. So I was kind of intrigued by this. It seems like a puzzle. And I looked into it, and it turns out that if you compare areas in Colombia, for instance, where crop eradication has gone on with areas where it hasn't the price of coca leaf - the wholesale price of coca leaf doesn't really change. And the theory is that the cartels in the area have what economists call a monopsony, so that's like a monopoly on buying in the area. In other words, they're the only ones who buy the products in the area. And this rang a bell with me because it's something that people very often say about Wal-Mart. They say that in certain industries, Wal-Mart is effectively the only buyer in the industry. And so if there's some disruption to supply - let's say the harvest fails for apples or something like that - apple growers aren't able to increase their prices because Wal-Mart is the only buyer. And they say well, sorry, but this our price. And if you don't want to sell to us, well, tough. And so the sellers have to carry on selling it at the same price as before. And it seemed that something similar might be going on in the cocaine industry. And sure enough, when you look at the price data, that's exactly what you see. There's no difference in the price in areas where eradication has taken place and where eradication has not taken place. And according to the analysis that's being done, it looks as if the reason for this is that the cartels that buy the drug are the monopsony buyers - the only buyers in each area. GROSS: So the cartels aren't, like, learning from Wal-Mart. It's just that that's the way both Wal-Mart and the cartels operate. WAINWRIGHT: Yeah, that's right. I don't think there's a kind of conscious decision where the cartels have gone out there and thought - hey, let's be exactly like Wal-Mart. But it just - it helps to explain why this strategy, which on the surface, as I say, looks quite effective - you know, governments have been able to disrupt the supply of cocoa leaf quite well. It helps to explain why it actually has had very little effect on the price. And I mean, that's not the only reason. When you look at the economics of the supply chain, you begin to see why actually, even if you could increase the price of that coca leaf, it's doubtful that it would have very much impact on the final price of cocaine in the U. S. or in Europe. Because to make, for instance, a kilo of cocaine, you need about a ton of coca leaf, and that ton, once it's all dried out, in a country like Colombia, it will fetch perhaps $400. Now, the kilo of cocaine in the United States will fetch about a $100,000. And so if you - let's say you're incredibly successful in managing to raise the price of coca leaf and you manage to double it to $800. If you then manage to transfer all of that extra cost onto the consumer, that final kilo of cocaine is only going to cost now $100,400. In other words, you can double the price of coca leaf and you increase the price of the final product, cocaine, by less than 1 percent. And I sometimes say it's a bit like - imagine if you were trying to increase the price artwork and you decided that you would do this by driving up the cost of paint. You know, you wouldn't expect it to have a very big effect because the cost of paint is such a tiny, tiny part of the overall price of the finished product. It's just the same with cocaine. We're putting all this effort into raising the price of coca leaf, when, in fact, that's only a small part of the cost of the final product. GROSS: In keeping with the theme of how cartels compare to legit businesses and how they operate - franchising (laughter). Like, some of the cartels franchise. You compare them to McDonald's in this respect. And an example that you give is the Zetas. So who are the Zetas? And how did they franchise the brand? WAINWRIGHT: Well, the Zetas are one of Mexico's biggest drug cartels, and they have a reputation for being one of the nastiest ones. So when you see pictures of people who've been beheaded or hung up from bridges, you know, these are often the guys who are responsible. And while I was in Mexico, the Zetas expanded more quickly than any other cartel. It was extraordinary. They originally came from the northeast of Mexico, but within a very short space of time, they spread across all of Mexico and, in fact, down into Central America as well. And so I got thinking about how they'd done this. And when you look at the way that they spread, it seems that what they do is that they go to local areas and they find out who the local criminals are - the people who do the drug dealing and the extortion and all the other kinds of crime - and they offer them a deal. They say - OK, you can use our brand. You can call yourself the Zetas, just like us. And they give them, believe it or not, baseball caps with embroidered logos, and they give them T-shirts with their logo on, and they train them in how to use weapons sometimes. And in return, the local criminals give the Zetas a share of all the money that they get from their criminal activity. So in other words, it's exactly like the kind of franchising model that many other well-known companies use. And it comes with all the same advantages and disadvantages. I mean, one of the big advantages is that it's allowed the Zetas to grow much more quickly. One of the disadvantages, though - and this is something that you often see in the legitimate franchising business - is that the franchisees often start to quarrel among each other. And the trouble is that the interests of these franchisees, the local criminals, aren't very well aligned with the interests of the main company. Because as far as the main company is concerned - and this applies whether it's the Zetas or McDonald's - if you've got more branches - more franchises - in a local area, that means more income for the main company because they take their money as a slice of the income of the local franchisees. But the local franchisees have totally different motives. They want to be, if possible, the only ones in the area. They want as few branches as possible. And so you've had, very often, cases of franchisees suing the main brand over what they call encroachment, in other words, when the main brand has too many branches in the same area. GROSS: So just to back up a bit - you mentioned - so, like, with the Zetas that they gave out -what? - like T-shirts and hats with their logo on it with, like, the Zeta (laughter) - the Zeta name or the Zeta logo? I mean, the Zetas are a drug cartel. Is it really OK to be walking around with their logo on your T-shirt? Doesn't that kind of get in the face of the police? WAINWRIGHT: You'd think it might, wouldn't you? Yeah. I mean, it depends where you are. I think in some parts of Mexico, that would be a problem. I mean, not all of Mexico is quite as chaotic as what you see on the news. And certainly, if you walk around Mexico City, it's much like walking around a city in - you know, in the United States or in Europe - or at least in the kind of rich very center of the town. But in other bits of Mexico, that's not the case. I mean, you can - sometimes on sale in local markets in cities, including, indeed, actually on the edge of Mexico City, you can see pirate DVDs for sale which have the brand on them. The - you know, it's like a - zeta, I should say, in Spanish, just means the letter Z, or zed, as we say in Britain. And people in northern Mexico even complain that sometimes if you go to a bar, you'll find bottles of whiskey which have this letter Z on them because the cartel - the Zetas - have got into all of these different types of business. And really, like any other big business - like any multinational - they're starting to diversify because they've found that - well, lo, there's plenty of money to be had in drugs. You know, there are lots of other opportunities out there. GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is Tom Wainwright. He's the author of the new bookmark \"Narconomics,\" which is a business reporter's look at how the drug cartels in Mexico and South America actually operate financially - you know, what their supply side is like, what their business model is. And Wainwright is the Britain editor of The Economist, and he's their former Mexico correspondent. Let's take a short break here and then we'll talk some more. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, we're talking about, like, what the business model is for drug cartels in Mexico and South America. And my guest is Tom Wainwright, author of the new book \"Narconomics. \" He's a business reporter who decided to report on the drug cartels as if they were legit businesses and see how they operate. He's the Britain editor of The Economist and The Economist's former Mexico correspondent. You write that cocaine starts to become really valuable a little further down the supply chain, not where the coca leaves are grown but further down the supply chain at the U. S. border. It's probably an obvious question, but why is that an important place in the supply chain? WAINWRIGHT: Well, it's a really good question actually because I think very often, when we're reporting on the drug war, people forget that the drug changes value as it moves down the supply chain. And very often, you see these stories where the DEA or the Mexican authorities intercept a large quantity of drugs. And it's reported that these drugs have a street value of however many million dollars. But often, when you look more closely at how much these drugs are worth, you get a slightly different kind of number. And it looks rather less impressive. And just to give one example, when I arrived in Mexico, soon after I got there, there was this incredible finding in Tijuana, where the Mexican police found this amazing stash of marijuana. It was more than a hundred tons of the stuff, all in this warehouse on the edge of Tijuana. And it was reported in some corners of the press that all of this represented a blow against organized crime to the tune of about half a billion dollars. It was nearly $500 million, some people said. And I thought about this. And I thought, you know, can it really be that much? That's a huge amount of money because the drugs business is big enough, but it's not that big. And how could any cartel withstand a kind of defeat like that? So I looked into it a bit more, and it turned out that the way that this calculation had been done was using retail prices in the states. I mean, they just figured a gram of marijuana in American might cost, you know, maybe about, say, $5 as a conservative estimate. And so a hundred tons multiplied by that amount gives you this incredible total. But in fact, this is crazy. I mean, imagine if you did that with another product, like, say, coffee. And you said, well, a cup of coffee in the states in Starbucks costs - what is it? - two or $3 or something lie that. And in that cup of coffee, you've got one or two grams of coffee granules. So that must mean that the kilo of coffee intercepted in Colombia is worth $2,000. And of course it's not. I mean, we know that that's absurd. And the reason that coffee increases in price is because the value of coffee is in - let's say if you have it in a cafe like Starbucks - it's in the fact that it's being served to you. It's in the fact that Starbucks has to pay rent on its premises. It has to transport it around the world and so on. That's why it increases in value. And so it's just the same with a drug like cocaine or marijuana. In Mexico, that drug there in a warehouse, it has a value. But it's not worth anything like as much as it's worth on the streets in the United States. And in fact, in Mexico, the wholesale price of cannabis or marijuana is much less. It's like $80 per kilo. So that stash, which supposedly was worth half a billion dollars, was probably worth about maybe $10 million, which, you know, is not nothing. But it's about 2 percent of the amount that people originally thought. GROSS: So because the border crossing is so important, because the value of the drugs increase across the border, you say that's why there are so many cartel wars at border towns that have legit border crossings. Give us a sense of the kind of wars that are going on in the border crossing towns. WAINWRIGHT: Well, you're right that when you see these reports about violence in Mexico, it's very often taking place either along the border or in cities like Ciudad Juarez or Reynosa or Tijuana, places like that - or occasionally in port cities, like Acapulco or Lazaro Cardenas, and places like this. And the reason really is that these are the kind of pinch points. They're a limited number of places at which you can transport cocaine or marijuana or, indeed, anything else into the U. S. And so if you want to smuggle large quantities of drugs into the states, you really have to control one of these cities. That's why the cartels fight so brutally for control of these particular places. It's why you see in Ciudad Juarez, in the past at least, a murder rate which was perhaps 200 times the murder rate in the U. K. , whereas in Mexico City, you see a murder rate which is - you know, it's higher than here in Britain. But it's comparable with some cities in North America. GROSS: You say that the cartels have personnel and HR issues that are similar to the issues that legitimate businesses face and that you've spoken to cartel leaders who sound like CEOs. Who have you spoken to? WAINWRIGHT: Well, this was a guy that I had in mind in particular who I went to see in El Salvador. And he's a guy called Carlos Mojica Lechuga, who is the leader of one of the two big street gangs in El Salvador. There are two of them, one called Barrio Dieciocho, or the 18th Street Gang, as most people call it in English, and the other, called the Mara Salvatrucha. And both of these are effectively transnational corporations, really. I mean, they make their livings dealing drugs and with extortion, principally. Those are the two main business lines that they have. And so I thought it would be interesting to go and speak to this guy and find out how he ran his company. So I went to see him. And he's in jail at the moment, which doesn't seem to be stopping him from running his business in any way. So I went to see him in this prison in El Salvador. And apparently by the standards of El Salvador, this is classified as a medium security prison. But it didn't look like one. I mean, outside you had soldiers with machine guns behind nests of sandbags, and. . . Anyway, I went in there and handed over my telephone and all the rest of it and went in. And they brought this guy in. And he's - just to describe him, you may have seen pictures of these El Salvador gangsters. They're the ones who very often have tattoos from - literally from head to toe. And sure enough, this guy Carlos had a great big tattoo going across his forehead, saying in Spanish, in memory of my mother. And all over his body, he had these tattoos with the number 18 featuring prominently, which was the name of his gang. And so we sat down, and we started talking business. And it really turned out that a lot of his complaints were just like the kind of complaints that I'd heard many times before from other businesspeople. He complained about managing his staff. He complained about competition with his rivals. He complained about, you know, his image in the international media. It was really strangely reminiscent of speaking to a kind of frustrated, mid-level manager. And sure enough, the kind of tactics that his gang is employing are not so different from the ones that other firms employ. And when I was there, the main sort of business strategy that he was experimenting with was a temporary truce, the kind of collusion with his archrivals, this other gang, the Mara Salvatrucha that I mentioned. And the two gangs had decided at the time to stop murdering each other, which they'd been doing a lot, because they thought it would be better for business. And it had the most incredible effect. I mean, San Salvador, the capital of El Salvador, at one point was the world's most murderous city. And after the gang signed this truce and decided to collude, the murder rate fell by about two-thirds overnight. And it was - by that stage, it was lower than in some cities in the states. GROSS: What did they collude on that enabled them to make this truce and still feel like they were getting what they wanted from their business? WAINWRIGHT: Well, the key difference, really, between the situation in Mexico, for instance, and the situation in El Salvador is that whereas in Mexico, the number of border crossing points to the states is so limited that the cartels really have to compete with each other, in El Salvador, they have a slightly different model where really, they just control territory in the country of El Salvador. And there's plenty of that. And so they divide it up among themselves. So in this case, the Barrio Dieciocho was quite happy to control some parts of the country while the Mara Salvatrucha controlled other bits. And they found that if they left each other alone and effectively ran small, local monopolies, they were able to get higher profits than if they competed across the whole country. In Mexico, it's slightly different because controlling a city like Ciudad Juarez is so valuable that no cartel is currently willing to cede it to any other. It makes sense for them, from a business point of view, to compete over that particular location. And that's why the level of violence in Juarez at the time was so high, whereas in El Salvador at the time, they were willing to collude and sign this truce. GROSS: My guest is journalist Tom Wainwright, author of the new book \"Narconomics. \" After a short break, we'll talk about how it would affect drug cartels financially if drugs were legalized and regulated in the U. S. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross, back with Tom Wainwright, author of the new book \"Narconomics\" in which he writes about the global industry as if it were a business like any other business. And he finds surprising similarities between the cartels' business models and the business models of big-box stores and fast food franchises. Wainwright started research on the book when he was the Mexico-based correspondent for The Economist. He's now the magazine's Britain editor. When we left off, we were talking about an interview he did with a cartel leader. So getting back to the interview that you did with the cartel leader who was in an El Salvador prison - it's dangerous to write about the drug wars because a lot of the cartels attack journalists. There's so many journalists who've been murdered. I think that's particularly true in Mexico. So did you feel like you were taking a risk to speak to this guy who's tattooed from head to foot and is a cartel leader? He's in prison, but he's still running the cartel. Did you feel like that put you at risk? WAINWRIGHT: Well, I felt kind of nervous to say the least. Yeah, I mean - (laughter) I went into the prison and, you know, they showed me into this cell. And they took the guy in and took off his handcuffs and shut the door behind us, and we were the only two in there. So I - yeah, I was kind of nervous about that. That meeting turned out fine. And in the end, actually, he was kind of intrigued by my line of questioning. I think he wasn't really used to being interviewed as though he were a businessman. And by the end, he was telling me all about his admiration for the criminal gangs of East London who he told me he'd always greatly admired as fellow entrepreneurs. But I think, in terms of the threat to journalists, it's very real. But it's worth just making clear that, really, the journalists who undergo the really serious risks are the Mexican journalists. I mean, the - those are the men and women who have been killed in horrible numbers in recent years. In the past decade, more than 60 journalists have been murdered in Mexico. And really, it's the Mexican journalists that bear the brunt of this, partly because - I think - the level of impunity for murdering a local journalist is greater than it would be for murdering a foreign one and also because it's often the local journalists that do the kinds of stories that hurt the cartels most. They're the ones that name the local police officers and the local politicians who are involved in corruption on a very local level, whereas the foreign journalists like me, on the whole, tend to do, kind of, bigger picture stories which are perhaps less in danger of naming and shaming, kind of, local people on a very, sort of, micro level. GROSS: So, you know, in talking about the pressures on journalists and the dangers that journalists risk, especially in Mexico, if they write about business. I mean, there's so many reporters who have been murdered by the drug cartels. And you write that sometimes, the cartels want you to shut up and not report anything related to the drug wars - any of the murders or anything. And other times, they want publicity, and they want you to report on it. And sometimes one cartel wants you to report on things, and another cartel doesn't. You quote, in your book, an editorial that was on the front page of the El Diario De Juarez - which is, I guess, a daily newspaper in a Juarez? WAINWRIGHT: That's right. Yeah. GROSS: And this was in 2010. It's on page 88. Would you read that editorial for us? WAINWRIGHT: Well, the title of this editorial was simply, \"What Do You Want From Us? And it went like this. It said - (reading) gentlemen of the different organizations that are fighting over the territory of Juarez, we bring to your attention that we are communicators, not mind readers. For that reason, as information workers, we want you to explain what you want from us - what you want us to publish or stop publishing - so that we know what to stick to. You are, at the moment, the de facto authorities in this city because the legally instituted powers have been able to do nothing to prevent our colleagues from continuing to fall. GROSS: So - that was pretty brave, no? Direct message to the cartels and so sarcastic. Oh, be clearer what you want. You want us to write about you or not? And how are we to know which is which? WAINWRIGHT: Well, I think they were at their wits' end. This was published just after the latest murder of one of their journalists. You know, it wasn't the first by any means, and I think they didn't know what to do. And in a way, although the editorial was addressed to the cartels, I think the real audience perhaps was the government. I think this was really a message to the government saying - look, you guys are doing such a hopeless job of maintaining security in this city that we're actually having to bargain with the cartels over what we can write. And it had the desired effect. This article was very widely reported in Mexico and, indeed, outside Mexico as well. It made quite a big story. So I think, probably, the reporters had in mind a bigger audience than just the cartel members. But it's true that the journalists very often do end up communicating with the cartels and covering news in a way that the cartels want. And a good example of this was - when I was in Juarez, I was on a visit to the morgue there - the city morgue. And I spoke to one of the pathologists there, and he gave me a piece of advice in Juarez. He said never go outside in Juarez at quarter to 6 in the afternoon. That's the most dangerous time of day. And I said - well, why is that? You know, I would've thought the most dangerous time would have been late at night or, you know, just before dawn or something like that. And he said no, quarter to 6 is the most dangerous time, and it's because that's 15 minutes before the evening news bulletin. And very often, the cartels murder people at exactly that time because they know that if there's a murder then - at quarter to 6, all the news reporters will go to cover it. And there'll be there live, and it will be the main story on the evening news. And very often, that's what they want. They want to send a message to their rivals, or they want to send a message to the public that they're the dominant cartel in town. And so, they're so cynical that they actually time their murders around the news bulletins. And quarter to 6, this man told me, is the most dangerous time to be out. GROSS: Wow. (Laughter) Did you take that advice and not go out then? WAINWRIGHT: Yeah. I cowered in my hotel room at quarter to 6. (LAUGHTER) GROSS: Well, in one city you were going to - I forget what city it was - you had, like, a GPS tracking device that was secretly hidden in your sock or something. . . WAINWRIGHT: Oh, yeah. GROSS: . . . So that somebody could be aware of where you were - in case you were in danger, they'd know where to find you. And then you get off the plane and find that the tracking device isn't working (laughter). So, you're. . . WAINWRIGHT: Yeah, that wasn't a great moment. GROSS: Yeah. So you're left alone without any kind of hope of somebody knowing where you are and if you're safe or not. What was the assignment you had given yourself that you continued to do in spite of the fact that the GPS went dead? WAINWRIGHT: Well, this was when I was going to Ciudad Juarez. And it was in, I believe, 2011, which I wasn't to know at the time, but this was to turn out to be the most violent year in Juarez, when the murder really hit its peak. And I was just going there to try to figure what was going on - to try to figure out why the violence was suddenly so high in this one city, why it had risen so quickly. And I hadn't been to the city before. And so before I went, I went to speak to this security consultant in Mexico City, and just said doesn't look - you know, how dangerous is this? Am I going to be OK? And he looked kind of - a bit nervous about the fact that I was going. You know, he could tell that I hadn't been there before and didn't really know the city very well. And so he gave me this tracking device and said - well, look - you know, hide this on your person. And that way, if you go missing, then we'll be able to figure out where you are. Or at least, you know, if you hide it in your sock, he said, then at least we'll know where your right leg is. . . (LAUGHTER) WAINWRIGHT: . . . Which was slightly. . . GROSS: Yeah, that's encouraging (laughter). WAINWRIGHT: . . . Slightly intimidating. So I took it with me. And you know, I go there, and the plane landed. And I went into the bathroom in the airport and tried to switch this thing on, and the light didn't come on. And so I was left there without this tracking thing, but I decided to get on with it anyway. And I just called back to my office constantly to let them know, you know, that I was emerging from one meeting and going into another. And it just had the feel of the city under siege. And I was going through the city with a taxi driver, and it was a boiling hot day. But I noticed everybody had their windows very firmly rolled up. And, you know, people were just very, very unhappy about the idea of being out in public at all. And another thing I noticed was that the taxi driver allowed plenty of space when we were stopping at traffic lights. He allowed lots of space between us and the car in front. And this was kind of strange because in Mexico City, the driving is quite aggressive. You know, people aren't always terribly polite with their driving, but in Juarez everybody was being very, very courteous and leaving lots of space. And I asked this taxi driver - what's going on? You know - why are people driving so carefully and leaving so much space between each other?  And he said well, it's because very often, at these stoplights - at traffic lights - it's where you have executions. It's where you have these shootouts. Very often, one cartel will come up to a member of another at a traffic light and shoot him dead in the car where it's a place where they can't get out very easily. So the reason he was leaving plenty of space was so that if a shootout began, he would be able to maneuver out of the way. And it was things like that that were extraordinary. As I saw, this was just over the border from the States. And it was really a city that felt like a city war. GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is Tom Wainwright. He's the author of the new book \"Narconomics,\" which looks at the drug cartels as if they were legit businesses to try to understand - what's their supply chain like? You know, how do they make their profits? How do they keep people in line? What are their HR problems? And Wainwright is the Britain editor of The Economist and was based in Mexico for The Economist when he did a lot of the reporting for this book. Let's take a short break then we'll talk some more. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is Tom Wainwright. He is the Britain editor of The Economist, the former Mexico Bureau chief for The Economist. And he is the author of the new book \"Narconomics,\" which is a business reporter's look at how drug cartels really operate and make their profits. You examine at the end of the book what it might look like if the U. S. legalized and regulated drugs like marijuana and heroin and cocaine. How do you think the legalization and regulation of those drugs would affect the Mexican and South American cartels and all the crime that goes along with that? WAINWRIGHT: Well, we're already starting to see an impact on the cartels from the legalization of the marijuana business. Some of those cartels rely - or in the past, at least relied quite heavily on marijuana for their income. Some of them got about half of their income from cannabis. So in that sense, it's hitting them pretty badly. And I think the same thing probably would be true with respect to other drugs. There's an interesting example underway in Switzerland where they've legalized heroin, which sounds crazy. But it's worth making clear that when they legalized it, they haven't put it on sale in the way that marijuana is on sale in Denver. They've just legalized it by allowing doctors to prescribe it to people who are already addicted. And it's had quite an interesting effect there because many of the people who are addicted to heroin in Switzerland and indeed in other countries are people who deal the drug because if you're addicted to this drug, it's a very expensive habit. And for many people, the only way they can afford it is to deal it on the side. And so in Switzerland, what they found is that by taking those very heavy using addicts into treatment, they've stopped them from dealing the drug because now they get their own drug free of charge from their doctors. And because they're no longer out their on the streets dealing the drug, the number of new users has dropped dramatically. And so in Switzerland, funnily enough they found that since they legalized it in this very, very limited, restricted, controlled way, the number of new users actually has fallen quite a lot. And of course, the illegal supply has dried up almost entirely because the supply now is run by the government. So I think - I don't think there's any good way of controlling the drug problem because these are for the most part harmful drugs which are going to do people much good. But it seems to me that what I've seen is that the least bad way to control them is for governments to get more involved in the business themselves because the choice that I think we face isn't really a choice between a world without drugs and a world with drugs. I think the choice we face really is between a world where drugs are controlled by governments and prescribed by pharmacists and doctors and a world where they're dealt by the mafia. And given that choice, I think the former sounds more appealing. GROSS: So when you're talking about regulating a drug like heroin, you're talking about doctors prescribing it to help people who are already addicted get off of it. WAINWRIGHT: Absolutely, yeah. And the thing to understand about legalization and regulation is that there's a whole spectrum of regulation that you can get involved in. You can regulate something very, very lightly if you want, like, say, the way caffeine is regulated, which is to say not really at all, or you can regulate it very, very heavily in the way that something like, say, Valium is regulated. It's controlled more strictly by doctors. And I think the harder the drug, the more damaging the drug, the more you would want to go along that spectrum towards the drugs which are more heavily regulated and dished out by doctors. GROSS: You also questioned where we put our priority in terms of trying to stop the drug trade and where do we put our money. And a lot of that money goes towards law enforcement and toward the destruction of crops at the source. You question whether that's the best use of money. What's the model you'd like to see financially, as a business reporter, for the use of money to try to stop the drug cartels and to also try to stop more people from getting addicted? WAINWRIGHT: Well, I think if you look at the way that we fight the war on drugs at the moment, all of the attention or the great majority of the attention is on the supply side of the business, which is to say the smuggling side of it, the growing side of it, the trafficking side of it. And so governments have plowed lots of money and expended lots resources and indeed given up many lives of police officers in trying to down the production of drugs like cocaine in South America. What I suspect they might have more luck doing is actually looking at the demand side of the business - i. e. trying to treat addicts, more trying to educate people more about cutting down on their drug use. And there's some good evidence on this, actually. There was a good study a few years ago where a think-tank did an investigation into the effect of spending a million dollars on trying to stop cocaine consumption in the States. And they compared the effects of spending that million dollars at different stages in the business - so in South America, on the way to the States, within the U. S. , on educating people in schools and so on. And what they found was that for every million dollars spent on trying to reduce cocaine consumption by intercepting it in South America, you cocaine consumption in the States by about 10 kilograms. But for every million dollars that you spend in the States on drug treatment for people who are already addicted, you cut consumption by about a hundred kilograms. So it's 10 times more effective - you get 10 times more bang for your buck, if you'd like. And I think this just suggests that that's where the real wins are to be had. Everything suggests that all of the money being spent on trying to reduce drug use by interrupting the supply has gone about as far as it can go. And as I was saying earlier, the economics of the supply chain mean that even if you do succeed in increasing the price of coca leaf in South America, it doesn't have very much impact on the price of cocaine in the States because that coca leaf makes up such a small part of the overall final price, whereas if you do tackle the drug nearer its consumers and particularly if you tackle the demand side of the business, you have a better chance of both driving down the price because the lower the demand is, the less the cartels are going to be able to charge for their product and reducing the amount of consumed. So that seems to be the best way to tackle the business on two fronts. GROSS: But you point out in times of, like, budget crises - and we always seem to be trapped in budget crises - that the money is cut in treatment programs, prison reform. And you think those are often, like, the wrong places to cut because that's what can really help cut down on addiction. WAINWRIGHT: I think that's right. And people are understandably unwilling to spend money on things like prisons because prisons are where the very worst people in society go. But very often, actually, by economizing on things like that, you let yourself in for much, much higher costs later down the line. I mean, if you have a prisoner in jail and you neglect to give him or her the training that that person needs to get a job on the way out once they're out of jail, then you greatly increase the chances that they're going to go back to jail. And keeping someone in prison is a ludicrously expensive way to treat them. It's a great, great cost. It costs more to put someone in prison for a year in the States then it does to send them to the most elite boarding school here in England. I mean, it's a very, very expensive way to attack the problem. GROSS: Well, Tom Wainwright, thank you for the reporting, and thank you for talking with us. WAINWRIGHT: Thank you very much.

Thousands have been fleeing the city of Aleppo, many of them trying to get into Turkey. Two and a half million Syrians have already crossed that border during the war.

PETER KENYON, BYLINE: It's Sunday afternoon, and a commercial warehouse on Istanbul's European side is doing weekend duty as an humanitarian aid staging area. These people loading sacks of food into their cars are all volunteers. There are no uniforms, no logos and no leader. But questions do tend to get directed to an energetic woman who still can't believe this improvised operation is actually working. ZEYNAP KURMUS HURBAS: We never thought we could do it. (Laughter) We still don't believe we can do it. KENYON: Zeynap Kurmus Hurbas says last fall, after seeing one too many heartbreaking pictures of dead Syrian children on social media, she offered to coordinate aid deliveries in Istanbul. The next thing she knew, hundreds of families were depending on her and her friends. She makes it sound simple. HURBAS: We put a post on Facebook saying, this weekend we're going to give food and, you know, baby clothes and stuff to X amount of families. So people just buy things online and just send them to our depot here. KENYON: She's not fond of her online nickname, the Angel Without Wings. But she does appreciate how quickly social media helped her find others who were just waiting for a chance to share more than their sympathy. HURBAS: And look, we have - we have an American here as well. Come here. VALERIE TASIRAN: I'm Valerie Tasiran, and I'm from Fresno, Calif. KENYON: After a decade living in Istanbul, Tasiran noticed more and more pan-handlers in her neighborhood and thought there must be a better way to help. TASIRAN: Is it doing ultimate good? And so I wanted something more organized. My mom, who lives in the U. S. , also wanted to direct some aid to refugees. And so when I saw the announcement on Twitter. . . UNIDENTIFIED MAN: (Foreign language spoken). KENYON: The group finds the neediest families by working with neighborhood community centers like this one. They've been springing up to help Syrians just as Hurbas' aid group did. The next stop is a neighborhood of textile factories where many Syrians have under-the-table jobs. A disturbing story waits in one of the drafty cement apartment blocks. At the door, Hurbas hangs back. HURBAS: You can go in. I'll stay outside. KENYON: Is it OK? HURBAS: Yes. DERAR AL-JASEM: (Foreign language spoken). KENYON: Inside, Syrian Derar Al-Jasem, tall and barefoot, offers visitors a seat on the mismatched, donated furniture. He tries his basic English to explain the situation, which is distressing. AL-JASEM: My son every day bleeding - every day bleeding. You need bone marrow transplantation. KENYON: The son who bleeds every day and needs a bone marrow transplant is 7-year-old Abdulatif, who's busy playing a video game on the couch. He has a rare disorder called acquired aplastic anemia. Jasem's phone is full of pictures of his son bleeding from the nose and mouth and under his skin. And here's the excruciating twist. The most likely blood marrow donor match is Abdulatif's older brother, Abdullah. Months ago, he was right there with them when the family boarded a smuggler's boat bound for Greece. But when people saw Abdulatif bleeding heavily, his parents had to take him off the boat, leaving the 9-year-old brother to go on alone. Somehow, he made it to his uncle's in Germany. And the Al-Jasems have been waiting for permission to join them. By this time, Zeynap Hurbas has slipped into the room. She's quietly comforting Abdulatif's distraught mother. But as we get back to the car, she explains why she was reluctant to go in. The emotional toll these visits exact can be heavy. HURBAS: Yeah, I try not to go in because I get upset. I used to go in and know everybody's names and get in touch with them. But then they start dying. And you just have to find a way to distance yourself from the whole thing.

S. invaded Afghanistan with billions of dollars spent and thousands of American lives lost, the country remains profoundly corrupt. That's the finding of a new assessment by the group Transparency International with Integrity Watch Afghanistan. The group calls this report the first ever comprehensive assessment of Afghanistan's capacity to fight corruption. Sayed Ikram Afzali is the executive director of Integrity Watch Afghanistan and joins us from London. Welcome to the show. SAYED IKRAM AFZALI: Thank you very much. SHAPIRO: This report documents widespread systemic corruption through so many different parts of society, but can you just give us a specific example of how corruption comes up in the day-to-day life of an average person? AFZALI: People have to face corruption in many different forms. When they go to a school to admit their child, they have to pay a bribe. When they have to go to a hospital, they are asked to pay bribes. And people, when they have to go to courts because they have issues to be resolved, they have to pay a bribe to the judge. They have to pay a bribe to the prosecutors, to the police. People have to experience corruption on daily basis in many different forms when they have to go to different institutions to access services. SHAPIRO: And is this something that was true long before the U. S. invasion? Is it something that's just become a lot worse lately? How far back does this go? AFZALI: Corruption has been there before the U. S. as well, but it's a matter of the amount of money that was poured into the country without really thinking the negative consequences of putting money into institutions without ensuring that there is strong leadership and commitment to fight corruption and to provide services to the public. SHAPIRO: What do you think the U. S. should've done differently in the last 15 years to keep that from happening? AFZALI: I think the first thing which was done wrongly was to pick people who had very bad reputation, who had committed crimes in the past, who were - who misuse power. And the people who captured the institutions - they were - had no commitment to build institutions, yet the same people were given the opportunity to misuse power. So this was a big mistake on the part of the international community, especially the U. S. SHAPIRO: And now that we are in 2016 and all of these powerful people have all of this financial gain from a corrupt system, how do you persuade all of the judges and the prosecutors and the lawmakers who are making a lot of money off of these bribes, getting themselves and their friends out of prison, that they should scrap that system and go to a system where powerful people are held accountable, can be put in jail, can't buy their way out of a court case? AFZALI: I strongly believe that we can fight corruption if there is a strong political will. And if there is no political will, then there is no hope. But with strong political will and a top-down approach of putting in place strong leaders and independent institutions and letting those institutions do their job without political interference, things can be changed. SHAPIRO: Is there any country you see as a model that did this successfully? AFZALI: There are many countries in the world who have done it - Singapore, Hong Kong, even the example of Indonesia. They have been able to create independent institutions and give away power to these institutions so that they can follow corruption cases and prosecute people. And this can be done in Afghanistan as well. SHAPIRO: Sayed Ikram Afzali is the executive director of Integrity Watch Afghanistan. Thank you for joining us. AFZALI: Thank you for having me.

They hit an Islamic State training camp, and U. S. officials say they may have killed an Islamic extremist leader. U. S. officials say as many as 60 people were killed at the training camp. NPR's Tom Bowman joins us now from the Pentagon. Good morning. TOM BOWMAN, BYLINE: Good morning, Renee. MONTAGNE: What are U. S. officials saying happened in Libya? And it's a place, I must say, that many of us did not know that the U. S. military was in. BOWMAN: That's right. Well, what U. S. officials are saying is that two American F-15 warplanes flew out of England and completely destroyed this camp just west of Tripoli. They estimate there were around 60 or so ISIS members training here. And from intelligence information, officials say these fighters were planning attacks in the West. And they were watching this site for weeks, if not longer, with drones and other means and intercepting conversations. So they had a pretty good sense of what was going on there. MONTAGNE: And who do U. S. officials think they killed in this strike? BOWMAN: Well, besides the dozens of ISIS fighters, they say a man they know was at the site is Noureddine Chouchane. He was a top ISIS leader and responsible for a couple of major attacks next door in Tunisia last year. MONTAGNE: And we don't have a confirmation as of yet or this is pending? BOWMAN: They're saying they know he was at the site. He's likely dead and no sense of any, you know, confirmation of this. And there are no American troops on the ground there. But we are told there are intelligence operatives who could collect DNA and make a positive identification. Now, if that's impossible because of the destruction and condition of the camp, you could start to see ISIS put up martyrdom videos for this guy as they've done in the past when other leaders have been killed. MONTAGNE: Which is a kind of confirmation in and of itself. BOWMAN: Exactly. MONTAGNE: Remind us who this man Noureddine Chouchane is. BOWMAN: Well, Renee, he was a mastermind of two attacks last year in neighboring Tunisia - one at a museum, another at a beach resort. At the National Bardo Museum back in March, 22 people were killed. And then in June, another 38 people were killed at a beach resort - in the coastal resort at Sousse. And these attacks absolutely rocked Tunisia, and the targets were chosen specifically because they would cause foreign casualties. There was - they opened fire with automatic weapons at the beach resort, and a lot of these folks they killed were British. And before the Paris attacks, this Chouchane was considered really one of the ISIS leaders that intelligence officials were most concerned about targeting the West. MONTAGNE: And, Tom, you mentioned there were no U. S. military on the ground in this attack. But what has the U. S. military been doing in Libya? BOWMAN: Well, what they've been doing is looking for targets of opportunity. Last November, there was an attack killing an ISIS operative in Libya. So we expect to see more of these kinds of attacks. We don't expect to see this as a major military operation but basically looking for what they call targets of opportunity. That's precisely what happened in this case. There's no sense of any, you know, major troops heading toward Libya. Right now what they're trying to do is form a government.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE: (Chanting in foreign language). WERTHEIMER: Rival demonstrations suggest Indians are sharply divided over what constitutes seditious speech. NPR's Julie McCarthy is in New Delhi and has this story. JULIE MCCARTHY, BYLINE: Sedition carries a life sentence in India, and the high stakes matched the week's high drama. Followers of Prime Minister Narendra Modi descended on the campus they call a nest of anti-national activity. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE: I don't know. I don't know. MCCARTHY: Hours later lawyers pummeled students at a court complex in full view of police. Local media say more unruly lawyers assaulted the one defendant charged with sedition, student leader Kanhaiya Kumar. Police alleged that earlier this month on the campus of Jawaharlal Nehru University, he shouted anti-India slogans that glorified Afzal Guru, a Kashmiri separatist hanged for the 2001 attack on the Indian Parliament. Bundled into court, Kumar appeared terrified and denied the charge. India has been dissecting the Ph. D. student's experience and drawing very different conclusions. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)KANHAIYA KUMAR: We Indians will not tolerate this. They cannot raise slogans against our country because not a free speech. It is speech against our country. This is just a plot to destabilize our country. It is a plot to destabilize our country. MCCARTHY: That's Radshree Kumar, a supporter of a Modi government. Here's writer and filmmaker Sohail Hashmi. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)SOHAIL HASHMI: Whenever those in power want to suppress dissent they charge you for sedition. And who's going to define nationalism? And it is absolutely essential for anybody who will stand for democracy to stand with these students. MCCARTHY: If there are different understandings of free speech, there are also different perceptions of Jawaharlal Nehru University, or JNU. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE: (Singing) We shall overcome. We shall overcome someday. MCCARTHY: Singing and brandishing banners that read, defend the right to dissent, thousands of students from JNU lead a march through Central Delhi in solidarity with a jailed student they call Comrade Kumar. Students say the crackdown is politically motivated by a Modi government out to discredit the school's liberal tradition. Spokesman for Modi's BJP party Nalin Kohli says while they have long considered the school a bastion of leftist ideology, he denies any witch-hunt. Kohli says Indians generally share a revulsion of sloganeering that turns Guru into a Kashmiri martyr. NAHLI KOHLI: Secessionist thought which calls for violence and which calls for the breakup of a state, which calls for the rejection of the due process of law, which convicted a terrorist, there would be concerns, and obviously, an investigation is bound to happen. MCCARTHY: Guru's execution was publicly questioned when it was carried out three years ago. Parliamentarian Shashi Tharoor says going after students for criticizing the hanging now makes no sense. SHASHI THAROOR: It's absurd. It denies the possibility of evolution of their own drawing up and changing. It denies the very possibility that any university we allow all sorts of ideas to contend and flourish, and at the end of it, people come out with more expanded minds. That's what university should be all about. That's what democracy is all about. MCCARTHY: Tharoor wants Parliament to narrowly define what constitutes the crime of sedition. The student charged under the colonial era statute and who sits in high security lockup is back in court Monday asking for bail. Julie McCarthy, NPR News, New Delhi.

Followers of Prime Minister Narendra Modi descended on the campus they call a nest of anti-national activity. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE: I don't know. I don't know. MCCARTHY: Hours later lawyers pummeled students at a court complex in full view of police. Local media say more unruly lawyers assaulted the one defendant charged with sedition, student leader Kanhaiya Kumar. Police alleged that earlier this month on the campus of Jawaharlal Nehru University, he shouted anti-India slogans that glorified Afzal Guru, a Kashmiri separatist hanged for the 2001 attack on the Indian Parliament. Bundled into court, Kumar appeared terrified and denied the charge. India has been dissecting the Ph. D. student's experience and drawing very different conclusions. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KANHAIYA KUMAR: We Indians will not tolerate this. They cannot raise slogans against our country because not a free speech. It is speech against our country. This is just a plot to destabilize our country. It is a plot to destabilize our country. MCCARTHY: That's Radshree Kumar, a supporter of a Modi government. Here's writer and filmmaker Sohail Hashmi. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) SOHAIL HASHMI: Whenever those in power want to suppress dissent they charge you for sedition. And who's going to define nationalism? And it is absolutely essential for anybody who will stand for democracy to stand with these students. MCCARTHY: If there are different understandings of free speech, there are also different perceptions of Jawaharlal Nehru University, or JNU. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE: (Singing) We shall overcome. We shall overcome someday. MCCARTHY: Singing and brandishing banners that read, defend the right to dissent, thousands of students from JNU lead a march through Central Delhi in solidarity with a jailed student they call Comrade Kumar. Students say the crackdown is politically motivated by a Modi government out to discredit the school's liberal tradition. Spokesman for Modi's BJP party Nalin Kohli says while they have long considered the school a bastion of leftist ideology, he denies any witch-hunt. Kohli says Indians generally share a revulsion of sloganeering that turns Guru into a Kashmiri martyr. NAHLI KOHLI: Secessionist thought which calls for violence and which calls for the breakup of a state, which calls for the rejection of the due process of law, which convicted a terrorist, there would be concerns, and obviously, an investigation is bound to happen. MCCARTHY: Guru's execution was publicly questioned when it was carried out three years ago. Parliamentarian Shashi Tharoor says going after students for criticizing the hanging now makes no sense. SHASHI THAROOR: It's absurd. It denies the possibility of evolution of their own drawing up and changing. It denies the very possibility that any university we allow all sorts of ideas to contend and flourish, and at the end of it, people come out with more expanded minds. That's what university should be all about. That's what democracy is all about. MCCARTHY: Tharoor wants Parliament to narrowly define what constitutes the crime of sedition. The student charged under the colonial era statute and who sits in high security lockup is back in court Monday asking for bail.

Now an American businessman joined by an international crew of first responders has decided to make a difference. They raised money, got a ship and are now out on patrol trying to save lives. Joanna Kakissis spent time on board talking to the crew about its rescues and heartbreaks. JOANNA KAKISSIS, BYLINE: It's just before midnight when the crew of the Responder gets word that a boat nearby is in trouble. It's in Greek territorial waters in the southern Aegean Sea. EUGENIO MIUCCIO: Sometimes there is a light flash, very small. Oh, no. KAKISSIS: A doctor and nurse from Italy put on red life jackets ready to jump into a small speedboat. It's piloted by Mimmo Vella, who's from Malta. MIMMO VELLA: If something happens and people fall in the water, with the big boat we cannot go near them, so we go with the small ones.

KAKISSIS: But not today, Vella says. VELLA: We found nothing, so we're going to keep on patrolling. We'll see. KAKISSIS: The Responder is a search and rescue ship leased by a Malta-based charity called the Migrant Offshore Aid Station, or MOAS. It was founded by American businessman Chris Catrambone and his Italian wife, Regina. MOAS patrols a stretch of the Aegean Sea between Turkey and the tiny Greek island of Agathonissi. MOAS search and rescue operations officer John Hamilton explains that the water looks deceptively calm to migrants. JOHN HAMILTON: They could leave from a sheltered bay. They think it's nice weather. Once they get out of this bay, they come across, like, rough seas. KAKISSIS: The Responder has been backing up the Greek Coast Guard for two months, saving hundreds of lives here. But the crew cannot stop thinking about a boat they found on January 15. It haunts them. This audio comes from a video taken that day by MOAS. (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO)UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE: (Shouting, unintelligible). KAKISSIS: A boat had capsized, 23 people aboard, most of them Syrians and Iraqis. They screamed as they clung to the boat's blue and  white hull. A diver jumped in to help. (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO)UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Child, child, baby. KAKISSIS: Italian Dr. Eugenio Miuccio was aboard the rescue speedboat. He remembers how freezing it was that day. MIUCCIO: (Speaking Italian). KAKISSIS: \"Children and babies,\" he says, \"can only survive in cold seas for a few minutes. \" The diver handed him a chubby little boy no more than 2 years old. The boy was blue, foaming at the mouth, with no pulse. MIUCCIO: (Speaking Italian). KAKISSIS: \"I gave him CPR for 15 minutes,\" Miuccio says, \"but nothing worked. \" Then he saw two children who were unconscious but had a pulse. Miuccio and the nurse revived them. Back on the deck of the Responder, Mimmo Vella held the little boy who didn't make it. VELLA: Yeah, I still remember his face. He was like an angel, brown hair on head, the tights under his trousers. KAKISSIS: Vella has a son the same age. He placed the boy's body on a blanket next to a 4-year-old girl and her 2-year-old brother, who were also found dead. The parents did not know. VELLA: They were asking how is the kids, how is the kids, and then we have to tell them. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: (Crying, unintelligible). KAKISSIS: And the mothers fell apart, sobbing as they cradled the bodies of their children. Vella kneeled down next to the mother of the little boy he'd held. VELLA: I was holding the mother, and I couldn't resist. I cried because she was so much in pain. That pain, it's something you don't want to see it for sure because I believe that the children bury the parents, not the parents bury the children. If it happens to me, I don't know - life doesn't have sense anymore for me. KAKISSIS: He went to see the surviving children later, and he gave them toys his own kids had sent. Did you call your kids the next morning? VELLA: Yes, immediately, yes. KAKISSIS: What did you say to them? VELLA: That I love them so much and how lucky they are that they are safe at home.

And the average North Korean knows even less about us. The regime bans nearly all forms of outside media to make sure citizens there are exposed only to the party line. A group of nonprofits in the U. S. is trying to change that with USB drives. Sharon Stratton is with the North Korea Strategy Center, one of the groups involved. She told us how it works. SHARON STRATTON: Essentially, what we do is we load up these memory storage devices with very different kinds of content - so not only South Korean or Western films, shows. We put on documentaries, radio recordings, PDFs with South Korean newspapers, as well as an off-line version of Wikipedia. And we work with a network of trusted partners who work on the North Korea-China border. And they distribute these into North Korea. MARTIN: What are you trying to show? What are you trying to illustrate? STRATTON: Through focus groups in South Korea, we're able to sit down and have more in-depth conversations with recent defectors about what kind of media North Koreans are seeking, what they're amenable to and what they want to see more of. We don't put on any content that's inflammatory or critical or antagonistic towards the North Korean government. Not only would that compromise, potentially, the safety of North Korean users, but it's also just not going to be very effective. And North Koreans aren't really interested in that kind of content. One of the other kinds of content that we put on USBs are documentaries that are made by North Korean defectors who are adjusting to their new lives in South Korea. So they're able to show them, through the eyes of - of a North Korean, what it's like living in South Korea, you know, the challenges that come along with that but also the opportunities. MARTIN: What kind of risk do they incur by just watching that content? STRATTON: It is technically illegal in North Korea to access and to distribute foreign media. Security of these individuals in North Korea is our primary concern. It's important to remember that access to information in North Korea has been increasing. It's not just ordinary North Koreans who are accessing foreign media. It's actually also elites, people who are in government positions, people of sort of rank and privilege. So it's becoming more common. Simply possessing a USB itself is not going to see someone get thrown immediately into jail. MARTIN: Although, just if they get caught viewing them, I understand the penalty is hard labor or death, even. STRATTON: It's difficult to confirm what these punishments are. But defector accounts that we get range from - there's been open trials. Or you know, it may be that you have to pay off an official to avoid any kind of punishment. It is difficult to get information exactly on what kinds of punishments are being meted out. MARTIN: What about the smugglers, the people who you use as a network to actually physically move these USB drives across the border into North Korea? Are they paid? What's in it for them? What are the risks that they face? STRATTON: The North Korea-China border is much more porous than maybe many people would expect. There's somewhere in the tens of thousands of Chinese and North Koreans who are moving across that border. They're moving information. They're moving goods. And it's risky work for them. And there is a cost involved. So we do pay them. MARTIN: Are you trying to get people to defect? STRATTON: The end goal of our information dissemination efforts is not to get people to defect. It's more about North Koreans who are in North Korea being able to have a changed worldview, change their perspectives and then lead and sort of speak to any changes they want to see in their country themselves. The end goal is not to say, we want you to leave North Korea. We want North Koreans to be able to say, well, this is what I want for North Korea. MARTIN: Sharon Stratton is a U. S. program officer at the North Korea Strategy Center. Sharon, thanks so much for talking with us. STRATTON: Thanks so much for having me.

And there is a cost involved. So we do pay them. MARTIN: Are you trying to get people to defect? STRATTON: The end goal of our information dissemination efforts is not to get people to defect. It's more about North Koreans who are in North Korea being able to have a changed worldview, change their perspectives and then lead and sort of speak to any changes they want to see in their country themselves. The end goal is not to say, we want you to leave North Korea. We want North Koreans to be able to say, well, this is what I want for North Korea. MARTIN: Sharon Stratton is a U. S. program officer at the North Korea Strategy Center. Sharon, thanks so much for talking with us.

We're located in Washington, D. C. , which has no trouble being called the capital of the United States of America. That is undisputed. But there are such places as the toilet paper capital of the world, the gravel capital of the world, places with bragging rights to something other than just being where the government is. And writer George Pendle has created an interactive map at the website Atlas Obscura with world capitals. And to tell us about them, he's walked a mile from Capitol Hill to talk about the project. Welcome to the program. GEORGE PENDLE: Thank you for having me. SIEGEL: What is the toilet paper capital of the world? PENDLE: That would be Green Bay, Wis. And it became the capital of toilet paper for a very strange reason. Up until the early 20th century, there was some toilet paper, but it had a devastating problem. The paper had splinters in it. And there was no way of getting the splinters out, so every trip to the outhouse was a kind of game of Russian roulette. But Northern Paper Mill was one of Green Bay's finest toilet paper manufacturers. It came up with the splinter-free toilet paper, and that's what made Green Bay a booming capital city. SIEGEL: They took the splinters out of toilet paper, you say. PENDLE: They did. And it really, you know, helped mankind immeasurably. SIEGEL: What inspired you to map all of these so-called capitals? PENDLE: Well, it stems from a rather strange hobby I have, which is collecting photos of airport carpets from around the world. SIEGEL: Photos of airport carpets? PENDLE: Yes. My sanity has been questioned on that point. I was looking into where these carpets come from and who designs them, and I discovered they came from a city north of Atlanta called Dalton, Ga. And Dalton, Ga. is the carpet capital of the world. And the more I looked into it, the more I discovered that before it was the carpet capital of the world, it was the bedspread capital of the world back in the Victorian era. And I thought - there's a bedspread capital of the world and a carpet capital of the world? What else is there? SIEGEL: Now how serious do you get as the arbiter of capitals? That is, do you take any self-proclaimed capital and include it in the map? PENDLE: I think that's fair enough. I think, you know, a lot of the cities are kind of Horatio Alger-like cities. You know, they have brought it upon themselves to be great in any way they can, and this is their avenue of greatness. Some have had the designation thrust upon them purely because of the vast amount which they produce of a product. But some have been very cheerful in just proclaiming it, and nobody has argued against it. SIEGEL: We've been talking about capitals of the world that are in the United States, but not all of them are. What is Xiangtan, China, the capital of? PENDLE: It's actually the capital of jeans across the world. Xiangtan produces 800,000 pairs of jeans a day. SIEGEL: Do they have any subcontractors in Kurobe, Japan? PENDLE: (Laughter) I'm sure they do because as you well know, Kurobe, Japan is the capital city of zippers. SIEGEL: It's the zipper capital. PENDLE: That's right, because it is the home of the YKK Corporation, which stands for Yoshida Kogyo Kabushikikaisha - which, of course, you can't fit onto a zipper. So they shortened it down to YKK. And if you look down at your trousers, it's more than likely that you will see those letters on your zipper. Now don't do in public, maybe in private. SIEGEL: So some of the things that you found people being capital of or cities being capital of - well, you know, I mean, the world could tire of zippers someday. Velcro could put an end to zippers. PENDLE: Who knows what may happen? I mean, zippers were invented in America. The fastener, as they were known. But they went to Japan because the Japanese could do it better than Americans. SIEGEL: Since you began this project, have you been notified by cities around the world of things that they're the world capital of? PENDLE: Not yet, surprisingly. I'm surprised people haven't wanted to advertise their predominance in one single subject. I mean, it is kind of a badge of honor, yet it's also a badge of shame, in a way, to say that your entire city revolves around this one product. It's great, but it's also slightly humbling. I mean, when you look at - one of the strangest capitals is perhaps Anthony, which is a city which straddles the New Mexico-Texas border. And it has the most tenuous link of perhaps of any capital city I found, which was - it's declared itself the leap year capital of the world. SIEGEL: The leap year capital of the world? PENDLE: The leap year capital. It's nowhere near a dateline, it's - really, it's claim to fame seems to be, from the research I did, that a member of the Chamber of Commerce in Anthony was born on February the 29th, and so thought that this would be a great wheeze, to kind of name themselves the leap year capital. And literally, I think tens of people have flooded from around the world to celebrate their birthday there. SIEGEL: (Laughter) Well, I guess they'll have a big event coming up. PENDLE: I think so, I think so. SIEGEL: All this is on an interactive map at the website Atlas Obscura. People can make suggestions to you to add other world capitals? PENDLE: If they want to send in their world capital or even, you know, designate themselves a world capital, we'd be welcome to see it. Atlas Obscura is always out to find new places of wonder.

Journalist James Harkin spent time on the ground in Syria reporting on the race to save serious archaeological treasures. His story is in the current issue of Smithsonian Magazine, and James Harkin joins us from London. Welcome. JAMES HARKIN: Thank you. Thank you. WESTERVELT: James, let's start off in the once-stunning city of Aleppo in northern Syria. I've been there. I remember wandering around Aleppo's cavernous souk marketplace. It's this amazing arched UNESCO World Heritage Site dating back to the 13th century. It was an amazing piece. You visited in peacetime and, more recently, during wartime. Tell us what you saw and what's left of this ancient marketplace. HARKIN: It's a kind of wonderful natural archaeological maze in which you can get lost in the bustle. It was an amazing thing to behold, along with the famous mosque there, the Umayyad Mosque. And so to go back five years later and see the pummeling of this place and - you know, 1,000 of the market stalls in the souk have been reduced to nothing. One hundred-forty of the historic buildings have been, you know, tangled. The sound you can hear is the metal corsetry of damaged buildings twisting in the wind like sinister wind chimes. And so it was eerie, like the scene of a crime. WESTERVELT: Walk us through another gem, the Umayyad Mosque. It's more than a thousand years old. Tells what shape it's in today and why. HARKIN: The Umayyad Mosque is in very, very bad shape. The famous minaret is lying there in pieces. And in fact, one whole side of the whole mosque is in stones. It's in very, very bad shape. And what was famous about that mosque, or one of the things that was famous about it was its riches of Islamic art. And who knows where they are now? WESTERVELT: Let's be clear, James. All sides have damaged Syria's heritage - ISIS, Assad's government forces, various rebel factions sometimes competing among themselves. But the self-described Islamic State has systematically and deliberately set out to destroy just about every piece of pre-Islamic treasure in their interpretation of the Quran. Tell us about Palmyra. This is another place we both visited in peacetime. It's an incredible sight, and it's now under ISIS control. HARKIN: Absolutely. I think Palmyra has taken such a hit from all sides in some ways. You know, hundreds of Islamic State militants converged on the city. They took the city and they began holding not only the archaeology, but the people - including the staff, the archaeological staff - hostage. And famously, they gruesomely murdered the head of antiquities in that city, Khalid al-Assad. WESTERVELT: Tell us about him and why he was killed. HARKIN: Well, there are a number of reasons that were floated at the time. For a start, they simply don't like archaeologists. They see them as secular and idolatrous and part of a civilization that they find offensive. Another reason why they apparently killed Khalid al-Assad, according to some of his relatives, was that he refused to tell them where the archaeology was hidden because his staff has been very courageously involved in concealing some of it. A different story was told to me by professor Abdulkarim, who's the head of antiquities in Syria, who said that for some reason the Islamic State were convinced that there was tons and tons of gold in the museum in Palmyra. You know, Ma'amoun Abdulkarim, the archaeology professor, said you know, these people are crazy. They're stupid. There was no gold. But it's possible that they might have killed Khalid al-Assad because he refused to tell them where nonexistent treasures were that they were convinced - for their own paranoid reasons - that were there. WESTERVELT: James, it's not all grim. You write that some of Palmyra's treasures that were moveable were taken to safekeeping before the city fell, and that even some - you know, a last truckload of artifacts was sort of pulling out of the city as it was falling to ISIS. Tell us about that. HARKIN: Absolutely. And some very courageous people were involved in that. You know, one of the curiosities of the Syrian regime is that this regime thrives on the prospect of crisis. When I was in Damascus early in 2012, I was told by a friend of mine, a civilian, that the regime had already begun taking down the statues of Hafez al-Assad, the old dictator and the father of the current president. In other words, very early on this regime for its own authoritarian, slightly paranoid reasons had begun secreting all of this archaeology. And according to professor Abdulkarim, they have saved already 99 percent of the museum collections within Syria. So much of what you see on the TV where you see statues, you see Nimrud, you see Palmyra being exploded - that's the outdoor archaeology which couldn't be hidden away. But there are lots of very courageous people on both sides who are working against the grain to try and save this for better days. WESTERVELT: That's reporter James Harkin. His story about saving Syrian antiquities can be found in the March issue of Smithsonian Magazine. Mr. Harkin, thanks for speaking with us and for your reporting. HARKIN: Thanks, Eric.

I'm Rachel Martin. It is day two of a fragile ceasefire in Syria - so fragile, the diplomats who brokered it don't use that term. Instead, it's called a cessation of hostilities. And it's supposed to allow U. N. convoys the safety they need to get aid into parts of Syria that have been hardest hit, although airstrikes against ISIS are ongoing. This past week, the secretary of defense, Ash Carter, was on Capitol Hill asking Congress for $7. 5 billion to ramp up the fight against the co-called Islamic State. I sat down with Secretary Carter at his office in the Pentagon. And he told me the air campaign in Syria against ISIS is already accelerating. He described the mission. SECRETARY OF DEFENSE ASH CARTER: Oh, I mean, banks that they use and piles of money in banks, oil wells they've taken over or coerced people into operating on their behalf. We are using cyber tools, which is really a major new departure. . . MARTIN: So if I may ask you about that. . . CARTER: Sure. MARTIN: Because in the course of your testimony before Congress, you did say that U. S. Cyber Command is now launching attacks against ISIS. And there would be many people, I imagine, out there who would say, what? We're not doing that already? I mean, ISIS - there is this dual front. There is the battlefield and the air campaign and the war happening against ISIS in Iraq and Syria and other places. But then there is the online component. CARTER: Right. MARTIN: Why is a cyber dimension only happening now? CARTER: Well, other parts of our government take action in respect of law enforcement and intelligence efforts for people, for example, to plot in the United States. I'm talking about something different. I'm talking about attacking the ability of someone sitting in Raqqa to command and control ISIL forces outside of Raqqa or to talk to Mosul or even to talk to somebody in Paris or to the United States. So these are strikes that are conducted in the war zone using cyber essentially as a weapon of war. Just like we drop bombs, we're dropping cyber bombs. MARTIN: What is the priority? Because up until now, the U. S. has - correct me if I'm wrong - but treated these two separate threats in Syria separately. There's the threat from ISIS, and there's the threat from the regime. Is one more important than the other? CARTER: Well, the defeat of ISIL is our top priority, no question about it. And that is going to go on until ISIL's defeated no matter what. Now, we're not a party, in any formal way, to the Syrian civil war. What we want is an end to the Syrian Civil War. Now, this week there's been an important development there thanks to Secretary of State Kerry, which is not about ISIL at all. Again, it's about the Syrian civil war. MARTIN: A cessation of hostilities that's been reached with international partners to stop the fighting to bring some humanitarian aid. CARTER: Exactly. He has secured the agreement of all these parties that are fighting the Syrian civil war. MARTIN: But didn't you need Bashar al-Assad to sign onto that? Doesn't that create kind of this uncomfortable partnership with the guy you're trying to unseat? And what message does that send to the moderate revels? CARTER: Well, the only thing - the only thing that everybody's agreed to in the context of this is that they'll stop fighting each other for now. We'll have to see in the days ahead whether the parties abide by it or not. But we certainly hope they do because of all these innocent people who are caught up in this situation. But just to be clear, that doesn't put an end to the Syrian civil war. It's just a cessation of hostilities, but that's a very good thing given the humanitarian tragedy going on. MARTIN: I spoke with one of your predecessors recently, former Secretary of Defense William Cohen, who was forceful in his criticism of the administration. He said the humanitarian crisis, as you noted, is shameful. That's his word. He said - and I'm quoting here - \"President Putin has been bombing. And the United States has been dithering. \" Of course, he's referring to the Russian bombing campaign supporting the forces of President Bashar al-Assad. In your opinion, has Russia set the agenda that the U. S. is now having to - to follow along? CARTER: No, Russia's - Russia's had a very negative effect on this whole situation. They said they were going to come in to fight ISIL. That's not what they're doing. Instead, they came in and joined the civil war on the side of Assad, further fueling the civil war. So the Russian approach has been completely wrongheaded. MARTIN: But you need Russia. CARTER: We're asking them now to participate. Or we didn't ask them; they've agreed to be part of this cessation of hostilities. And they could - you're absolutely right. They have more influence with Bashar al-Assad than anybody else. So the way the civil war is brought to an end in its political transition is, very importantly, the Russians persuading Assad to leave. If they're willing to use their leverage against Assad to achieve that end, that's very welcome. MARTIN: But do you need it? Do you need their leverage to make sure Assad leaves? CARTER: I think that they have a lot of influence over Assad. Unfortunately, I don't think anybody can absolutely tell him what to do. But no question that those that have the most influence over Assad other than himself and his own forces are Russia and Iran. MARTIN: Before I let you go, one last question. CARTER: Sure. MARTIN: The president came out this week and announced a new plan to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. This is a plan that you spearheaded. To summarize, the gist of the plan is to try those who can be tried in military commissions and to convince third-party countries to take some of the detainees and then to take the remaining detainees and house them in a facility in the United States. This sounds awfully familiar to what the president has been talking about for years and has even floated the idea of housing detainees on American soil. So what's new in this plan? CARTER: It is - what he's been talking about, by the way, was what President Bush talked about as well. And what's new here is that at the moment, moving the detention facility has been forbidden by Congress by law. We need Congress to change the law in order to allow us to do that. MARTIN: Are they more likely to do that now than they were a couple of years ago? CARTER: Well, they have indicated and they wrote into their law last year that they would be willing to consider a proposal. So we put together a proposal. I hope it succeeds. I can't be sure. But I think it would be good for the country. And I hope that enough of members of Congress - many do, but not all do - see it that way, that they'll approve this proposal. And we can do - this would be a nice thing to close out. But I'm just not sure whether we'll be able to or not. MARTIN: U. S. Secretary of Defense Ash Carter, thanks so much for your time. CARTER: Rachel, good to be with you. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:   This is WEEKEND EDITION from NPR News. I'm Rachel Martin. It is day two of a fragile ceasefire in Syria - so fragile, the diplomats who brokered it don't use that term. Instead, it's called a cessation of hostilities. And it's supposed to allow U. N. convoys the safety they need to get aid into parts of Syria that have been hardest hit, although airstrikes against ISIS are ongoing. This past week, the secretary of defense, Ash Carter, was on Capitol Hill asking Congress for $7. 5 billion to ramp up the fight against the co-called Islamic State. I sat down with Secretary Carter at his office in the Pentagon. And he told me the air campaign in Syria against ISIS is already accelerating. He described the mission. SECRETARY OF DEFENSE ASH CARTER: Oh, I mean, banks that they use and piles of money in banks, oil wells they've taken over or coerced people into operating on their behalf. We are using cyber tools, which is really a major new departure. . . MARTIN: So if I may ask you about that. . . CARTER: Sure. MARTIN: Because in the course of your testimony before Congress, you did say that U. S. Cyber Command is now launching attacks against ISIS. And there would be many people, I imagine, out there who would say, what? We're not doing that already? I mean, ISIS - there is this dual front. There is the battlefield and the air campaign and the war happening against ISIS in Iraq and Syria and other places. But then there is the online component. CARTER: Right. MARTIN: Why is a cyber dimension only happening now? CARTER: Well, other parts of our government take action in respect of law enforcement and intelligence efforts for people, for example, to plot in the United States. I'm talking about something different. I'm talking about attacking the ability of someone sitting in Raqqa to command and control ISIL forces outside of Raqqa or to talk to Mosul or even to talk to somebody in Paris or to the United States. So these are strikes that are conducted in the war zone using cyber essentially as a weapon of war. Just like we drop bombs, we're dropping cyber bombs. MARTIN: What is the priority?

And they're racing to figure out how the virus works. NPR's Nurith Aizenman takes us now to a lab in the Colombian city of Cali, where they're trying to prove a link between Zika and a neurological condition that causes temporary paralysis. NURITH AIZENMAN, BYLINE: Researcher Beatriz Parra Patino opens the freezer section of a white refrigerator and takes out a tray of test tubes. BEATRIZ PARRA PATINO: I have the samples that I need to test today. So we have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10 - like 14 samples to test. AIZENMAN: The tubes are mostly filled with diluted blood or saliva. Parra says to her, each one represents a human being. PARRA: A human being, that's right. And I treat the tubes like if I was treating the person, so with respect and trying to do my best. AIZENMAN: Because the fact that a person's body fluids are in one of these tubes means there's a good chance that right now that person is suffering the excruciating effects of Guillain-Barre syndrome. It's a temporary condition in which your immune system starts attacking your nerve cells. People can lose the ability to walk, to smile, even to breathe. You get a sense of just how bad it can get at one of the hospitals that is sending these fluid samples to Parra. It's about 400 miles on the other side of Colombia in a city called Cucuta, an area with a lot of Zika cases. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: (Speaking Spanish). AIZENMAN: The head of neurology, Dr. Jairo Lizarazo, is visiting some of his latest Guillain-Barre patients. JAIRO LIZARAZO: (Speaking Spanish). AIZENMAN: \"One of them is a young doctor,\" he says, \"one of my own students. \" He finds Dr. Karina Luque collapsed in her hospital bed. Her face muscles are so stiff, it's hard for her to speak. KARINA LUQUE: (Speaking Spanish). AIZENMAN: \"When I sit up or when I talk a lot, I have to stop for awhile because I get really tired,\" she says. Lizarazo pulls back a curtain to reveal another patient, an older woman hooked up to breathing tubes. She's been on them for several days, he says. LIZARAZO: (Speaking Spanish). AIZENMAN: This is the most serious case. Guillain-Barre is usually rare. At this hospital, Lizarazo sees about half a dozen cases a year. But he says since the Zika outbreak started. . . LIZARAZO: (Speaking Spanish). AIZENMAN: \"Every one or two days, we get a new case. \" It's a pattern not just across Colombia, but in four other countries where Zika is spreading in a big way, which is where Carlos Pardo, an expert on neurology and neuroimmunology, comes in. CARLOS PARDO: I got a call from one of my colleagues in Colombia who was telling me about this initial outbreak of cases of Guillain-Barre. AIZENMAN: Pardo grew up in Colombia. But he's currently a professor at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore, where I reached him by phone. PARDO: I immediately made the connection that this may be related with Zika. AIZENMAN: He moved fast to set up a study, getting not just Dr. Lizarazo but doctors at four other hospitals in Colombia to collect fluid samples - blood, saliva, urine and spinal fluid, from their Guillain-Barre patients. Pardo wants to analyze the antibodies these patients have produced because he thinks that at the same time that those antibodies are fighting the virus, they're also latching onto nerve cells that have a component that look like Zika. PARDO: So in other words, the immune attack is confusing elements of the nervous system. AIZENMAN: Confusing it for Zika. But that's just a theory. First, Pardo and his collaborators need to prove something more basic. They need to show these Guillain-Barre patients really did have Zika. The challenge, Zika virus can only be found in the blood during an active infection. But it might linger longer in other body fluids, which brings us back to researcher Beatriz Parra Patino at that lab in Cali. She's testing not just blood but all those other fluids. Pardo knew Parra from his medical school days in Colombia. PARRA: Carlos just called me. Hey, what are you going to do with this? What is the plan? (Laughter). AIZENMAN: Pardo arranged for funding to buy Parra the ingredients to do the testing. She's measuring them out with a pipette now, getting ready to drop them into the test tubes with the patient samples. PARRA: I'm going to be quiet because I need to concentrate and put in the samples. AIZENMAN: Then Parra pops the tray of tubes into a machine that will run them through various temperature cycles. The results will be ready in two hours. Thanks to this extraordinary mobilization of research, proving the Zika connection to Guillain-Barre could take just a few more weeks.

This could help the moderate president's plans to improve the economy, but NPR's Peter Kenyon reports from Tehran that people don't see broader political changes coming anytime soon. PETER KENYON, BYLINE: A covered bazaar in north Tehran has its share of visitors, but there seems to be a lot more window shopping than buying going on. Carpet shop owner Ali Mirnezami confirms that impression. He says this shop has been operating for 90 years, but at the moment, things aren't looking goodALI MIRNEZAMI: (Through interpreter) The market is down. It's not bouncing back. Were still waiting for final election results. And we hope that will improve things, but so far nothing tangible. KENYON: Mirnezami is eager for Iranian President Hassan Rouhani to fulfill his promise to use the money coming into Iran as part of last year's nuclear agreement with world powers to boost the economy. MIRNEZAMI: (Through interpreter) They need to tackle inflation, bring it down and also create some jobs for our young people. Then they need to look to the production sector and rehabilitate our factories. I hope the early signs of a more cooperative parliament are true. KENYON: If the parliament isn't more cooperative, it won't be for lack of turnout by reform-minded voters. Even though few reform candidates were allowed to run, voters like Mohammad Reza Rezahani stood in long lines to try to keep hard-liners out of parliament. The reason, he said, is not just the economy. MOHAMMAD REZA REZAHANI: I vote today only for freedom - a little freedom, a little. I'm not having any freedom - a little freedom. KENYON: All right, would you like to see a parliament that can work together with President Rouhani? REZAHANI: Yes, yes, I like it. KENYON: It's clear that voters like Rezahani are yearning for more than just a job. Iran has a young population, and the desire to get out from under conservative religious social restrictions and to be able to speak their mind without fear of arrest is palpable. But nearly seven years after authorities crushed massive street protests, reformers are still threatened with arrest and expectations for change are extremely low. For one thing, there will be large numbers of conservatives in the next parliament who will oppose changes on sensitive issues like the mandatory headscarf for women. Iranians also see external reasons for caution. Analyst Foad Izadi at Tehran University says Iranians only need to look at the chaos plaguing the region to see how easily popular demands for change can get out of hand. FOAD IZADI: So if people want to change things, and a lot of people want to change things, they do not want another revolution because revolutions will be messy and deadly. And so they do want to change some aspects of of government, but they want to do it through polling stations that are organized by this government. KENYON: That leaves the focus on the economy, which suits cooking and catering business woman Sanaz Minaei just fine. She shows a visitor a cooking class at one of her several companies and says the opportunities for Iran are huge if only the country can rejoin the global economy as promised. SANAZ MINAEI: (Through interpreter) Certainly we'd like a parliament that will open up communications with the outside world. And when the parliament is cooperating with the government, there is more peace, and peace is good for business. My wish is to see all the sanctions finally lifted so we can get back to doing business with the rest of the world. KENYON: Minaei includes the U. S. in that wish, but doesn't expect it to come true overnight. She's one of Iran's most successful businesswomen and yet she can't even get a visa to visit her sisters in America, let alone do business there. Peter Kenyon, NPR News, Tehran. LOURDES GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST:   Last week, reformers in Iran made substantial gains in that country's parliamentary elections. This could help the moderate president's plans to improve the economy, but NPR's Peter Kenyon reports from Tehran that people don't see broader political changes coming anytime soon. PETER KENYON, BYLINE: A covered bazaar in north Tehran has its share of visitors, but there seems to be a lot more window shopping than buying going on. Carpet shop owner Ali Mirnezami confirms that impression. He says this shop has been operating for 90 years, but at the moment, things aren't looking good ALI MIRNEZAMI: (Through interpreter) The market is down. It's not bouncing back. Were still waiting for final election results. And we hope that will improve things, but so far nothing tangible. KENYON: Mirnezami is eager for Iranian President Hassan Rouhani to fulfill his promise to use the money coming into Iran as part of last year's nuclear agreement with world powers to boost the economy. MIRNEZAMI: (Through interpreter) They need to tackle inflation, bring it down and also create some jobs for our young people. Then they need to look to the production sector and rehabilitate our factories. I hope the early signs of a more cooperative parliament are true. KENYON: If the parliament isn't more cooperative, it won't be for lack of turnout by reform-minded voters. Even though few reform candidates were allowed to run, voters like Mohammad Reza Rezahani stood in long lines to try to keep hard-liners out of parliament. The reason, he said, is not just the economy. MOHAMMAD REZA REZAHANI: I vote today only for freedom - a little freedom, a little. I'm not having any freedom - a little freedom. KENYON: All right, would you like to see a parliament that can work together with President Rouhani? REZAHANI: Yes, yes, I like it. KENYON: It's clear that voters like Rezahani are yearning for more than just a job. Iran has a young population, and the desire to get out from under conservative religious social restrictions and to be able to speak their mind without fear of arrest is palpable. But nearly seven years after authorities crushed massive street protests, reformers are still threatened with arrest and expectations for change are extremely low. For one thing, there will be large numbers of conservatives in the next parliament who will oppose changes on sensitive issues like the mandatory headscarf for women. Iranians also see external reasons for caution. Analyst Foad Izadi at Tehran University says Iranians only need to look at the chaos plaguing the region to see how easily popular demands for change can get out of hand. FOAD IZADI: So if people want to change things, and a lot of people want to change things, they do not want another revolution because revolutions will be messy and deadly.

And the height of the wave of water will be about 28 meters. It will flood about 75 percent of the city. And then the wave will progress down and fill (unintelligible). GARCIA-NAVARRO: That's Nadhir Al-Ansari. He's a professor of civil engineering at Lulea University of Technology in Sweden. Thirty years ago, he compiled the first report on the structural problems there. The dam was built, he says, in the wrong place. After he filed that report, a process of grouting began. That's to stop seepage of water that had begun to leak through the dam. Large teams of workers had to shore it up 24 hours a day in order to keep it operational. The dam survived even a bombing. But then came ISIS. AL-ANSARI: In 2014, ISIS occupied the dam. And when they occupied the dam, all the engineers and workers, they run away and machines were destroyed. And even when they recaptured the dam, nobody has done any grouting. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Nadhir Al-Ansari says the government needs to put an evacuation plan in place for people who live in areas that would be flooded if the dam were breached. But that hasn't happened. This past week, authorities in Baghdad hired an Italian firm to start repairs again. But it's not a permanent solution. And the renovation project won't start right away. And as the snows melt this month, more water is flowing into the reservoir above the dam. It's left Nadhir Al-Ansari very, very concerned. AL-ANSARI: Really, I am very frightened.

Today, Indians own roughly half of the motels in the United States, and 70 percent of those motel proprietors can trace their heritage to one state in India - Gujarat.

STARR: This is one of 52 hotels owned by Hersha Hospitality Trust. Jay H. Shah is the CEO of the company. JAY H. SHAH: My father named the company after my mother. Hersha is my mom's name. STARR: Like a lot of second-generation Gujaratis in the hospitality business, Shah built the company up from modest origins. One of his family's first properties was the Red Rose Motel in rural Pennsylvania. It had just 23 rooms. Shah and his family lived behind the lobby. SHAH: There were a lot of chores to do. There was a lot of grass to cut. We'd skim the pool in the morning. STARR: Shah's father was an electrical engineer, but he'd always wanted to be an entrepreneur. That was common in the Gujarati community, according to Pawan Dhingra. He's the chair of the sociology apartment at Tufts University. PAWAN DHINGRA: They have a long tradition of working for themselves rather than working for someone else. STARR: The fact that so many Gujaratis became motel proprietors is something of a historical accident. It started with Kanjibhai Desai, an undocumented Gujarati immigrant who bought a motel in San Francisco in the early 1940s. As Dhingra explains, his example inspired Indians who came afterwards. DHINGRA: Some of the pioneers stayed at his hotel where they got the idea of pooling their resources to run one themselves. STARR: Gujaratis really began buying motels after 1965. That's the year the U. S. government began allowing in more people from developing nations. Now there are nearly four million people of Indian descent living here. JAN DEROOS: They really did change franchising. STARR: That's Jan deRoos who teaches at Cornell's School of Hotel Administration. He says Gujaratis played a huge role in the expansion of Best Westerns and Days Inns across the country. That's because they were willing to relocate to out-of-the-way places like Canton, Miss. , or Plainville, Ohio. DEROOS: Every small community in America today has a hotel or two as a result of this community taking some business risk in establishing a hotel. STARR: Being the only Indian immigrants in these isolated communities could be tough. Binita Patel's parents owned hotels in North Carolina in the 1980s. BINITA PATEL: It was hard. I mean, I remember someone pulling their window down and yelling, go back to your own country, as we were walking home. STARR: Gujarati families, though, stuck it out. And they did innovative things to make their motels profitable. They started the now-common practice of placing a washer and dryer in the room behind the lobby. That way the person working at the front desk at night would have the sheets and towels ready for the next day. They also economized by doing a lot of the upkeep themselves.

With more than 2-and-a-half million Syrians already sheltering in Turkey and thousands more anticipated in the next year, the EU wants to cut down on the flow of people to Greece and onward toward the heart of Europe. To find out more about how Turkey feels about all this, we're joined now by NPR's Peter Kenyon in Istanbul. Hi Peter, thanks for joining us. PETER KENYON, BYLINE: Hi, Michel. MARTIN: So we know that the EU wants hard limits on migrants. What does Turkey want from these talks? KENYON: Well, they'd like a little more help dealing with all of these people. I mean, they look at around at 2. 7 million Syrians here, hundreds of thousands of Iraqis and others, then they look at these 28 countries in the EU with about a third as many migrants, and those countries are saying sorry, no vacancy, go back. Turks don't find that very realistic nor very in line with the humanitarian traditions Europe's always talking about. MARTIN: Are there some developments today that make that point? KENYON: Well, just today we're hearing Macedonia has declared several cities inside Syria and Iraq to be safe areas, including Damascus and Baghdad, so they won't accept any Syrians or Iraqis from their respective capitals. Human rights workers say that's pretty ludicrous, neither city is safe. Out on the Aegean Sea, meanwhile, NATO's beefing up its efforts, but at least 18 migrants drowned. Turkey says - Greece says they've rescued another 400, so the situation's still dire. MARTIN: Is there any potential deal being talked about or are there any kind of outlines that you can share with us about the direction that the talks might go in? KENYON: Yes. European Council President Donald Tusk was here in Turkey this week. He says there's a plan taking shape. It's not entirely clear, but it seems Europe might be asked to add some more aid on top of the $3. 3 billion it promised Turkey back in November - which it has yet to pay, by the way. For its part, Turkey wouldn't object when Greece sends back Syrians and other migrants across Aegean Sea, and Greece has already started doing that. So the bottom line seems to be whatever they can do to end this dangerous dash to Europe. MARTIN: Well, is the European position sort of that these migrants should just stay in Turkey, or do they really expect them to stay in these conflict areas? I mean, is their point of view realistic? KENYON: It doesn't seem sustainable. I mean, this idea of cities inside Syria being safe is very hard to defend, and in Iraq as well. And Turkey is not an ideal place because it had unusual asylum rules. None of these Syrians, Iraqis, Afghans can seek asylum here. They can stay as guests. Beyond that, we're seeing bombs going off all the way from the border to Ankara and Istanbul. Things are getting tense, and it's just getting more dangerous all around. MARTIN: Peter, before we let you go, we've focused a lot on Syrians, of course, but what other migrants - Iraqis, Afghans, North Africans? KENYON: Well, exactly. I mean, this kind of resentment as they get shoved to the back of the line really has been popping up - well, since last summer even. You see fights in camps, and it's usually Afghans or Iraqis grumbling and venting their frustration because Syrians are now being given pride of place. And that gets to this really difficult question of who's a refugee fleeing danger, and who's an economic migrant just looking for a better life? MARTIN: That's NPR's Peter Kenyon in Istanbul.

I'm Rachel Martin. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)MARTIN: And this is For the Record. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)MARTIN: President Obama has been talking about closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, since he ran for president in 2008. Here he is on \"60 Minutes\" two weeks after that election. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"60 MINUTES\")PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: I have said repeatedly that I intend to close Guantanamo, and I will follow through on that. MARTIN: Now, eight years later, his administration has put out a plan to make it happen. Here's the president announcing it last month. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)OBAMA: With this plan, we have the opportunity, finally, to eliminate a terrorist propaganda tool, strengthen relationships with allies and partners, enhance our national security and, most importantly, uphold the values that define us as Americans. MARTIN: The plan is to transfer some of the remaining detainees to other countries. And those who can't be transferred would be moved to a facility in the U. S. And that's the part of the plan many in Congress are railing against. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PAUL RYAN: The president should rule out taking unilateral action to transfer Guantanamo Bay detainees to our shores. TIM SCOTT: We're afraid that those terrorists will bring their friends to our neighborhoods. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: It's dangerous, irresponsible. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: I just really think that we must continue to detain prisoners there at Guantanamo. . . MARTIN: It's not just lawmakers who don't like the president's plan. On Friday, a new CNN ORC poll found that 56 percent of Americans surveyed opposed shutting down the U. S. prison at Guantanamo Bay. For the Record today, closing Gitmo. We're going to bring you two different perspectives on the U. S. prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba - President Obama's top envoy on the issue and the Marine Corps general who just retired after overseeing the facility. But first. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)OMAR DEGHAYES: My name is Omar Deghayes. I'm a lawyer. I graduated from law school here in the U. K. And I was locked up in Guantanamo for about five years, several months - from 2002 to 2007. MARTIN: Omar Deghayes is one of hundreds of detainees who've been released from the U. S. prison at Guantanamo Bay over the years. Deghayes was apprehended in Pakistan in 2002. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)DEGHAYES: In my case, there was a mistaken identity. They had a photograph of a Chechen rebel, and they thought that was me. MARTIN: I spoke with Deghayes back into 2013, and he described several hunger strikes he participated in while he was detained. I asked him how they got started. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)DEGHAYES: Usually, it's a small incident - not small, but something grave takes place inside the camp. But that triggers other feelings - thinking about why we've been there for many, many years inside those prisons without any chance to look at the evidence, or there is no hope. All that - it comes together. And then it's a cry of help to the outside world. Usually, is that - it's the last resort. MARTIN: A last resort to get his case heard. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)DEGHAYES: We want our imprisonment to come to an end. We want proper courts to have our cases listened to in courts so that a final decision is made. And those who've committed anything can be convicted and imprisoned. And those who haven't committed anything should be released. MARTIN: That was the experience of one detainee more than a decade ago in the early years of U. S. wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. During that time, the U. S. government was using so-called enhanced interrogation techniques at Gitmo, including sleep deprivation, slapping and nudity. After the abuses came to light, President George W. Bush signed something called the Detainee Treatment Act in 2005, which prevents, quote, \"cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment\" of any prisoner of the U. S. government, including those at Guantanamo Bay. Today, there are 91 detainees left. JOHN KELLY: And the facilities they live in today are pretty good. Again, I wouldn't want to be a detainee, but if you have to be a detainee somewhere, Gitmo's the place to be. MARTIN: This is General John Kelly. He's the retired four-star Marine Corps general who oversaw the prison at Guantanamo Bay from 2012 until this past January. General Kelly insists that the detainees hold a lot of power because they can provoke their guards, and the guards can't retaliate. He described something called splashing. And just a note here, this is a graphic discussion. KELLY: Detainees frequently will mix up a concoction - typically of feces, urine and - for some reason, sperm is the special treat, I guess, from their perspective. And they put that into a concoction. And then when the guards will go and either give them their food or open the door to bring them out, they get splashed. And so they get a face full of feces and urine and all the rest of it. You know that, by law, is an assault. Nothing we can do to them. The only way we could control them in any way is to either give them privileges or take privileges away. But the point is, when they've been in our custody, they've been taken care of because the law requires it, and we're the good guys. They're not, but we are. But the. . . MARTIN: You know that about all of them? KELLY: Yeah. MARTIN: You don't have any doubts that any of them have been detained. . . KELLY: I can tell you there is a dossier on every one of them. We can quibble over what they were doing on the battlefield when we took them, but every one of them is a bad guy. MARTIN: Our second view on Gitmo comes from Lee Wolosky. He's the State Department's top envoy for closing the prison. Have you been there? LEE WOLOSKY: Yes. MARTIN: Are there images that stand out to you? What was it like the first time you went? WOLOSKY: Well, there are images in all of our minds about what Guantanamo was. We have images of men in open cages, exposed to the elements in orange jumpsuits. That is not at all what Guantanamo is today. It is a facility that is better - I'm a lawyer by training - better than any - certainly any state or local correctional facility or prison that I've been to. It's better than many of the federal facilities. MARTIN: So why close it? WOLOSKY: Well, I think part of the reason why we need to close it, as the president has said, is that it is a recruiting tool. It is because of what the world believes that it is. It doesn't matter what it actually is in certain respects. We've all seen images of hostages in the desert wearing orange jumpsuits as they are executed by Islamic State. This is an image that, unfortunately, has proven to be indelible, and it has proven to be a recruiting tool for Islamic State. MARTIN: General John Kelly doesn't buy that argument. KELLY: I have three tours in Iraq, a lot of interaction with detainees. None of them ever said to me, you know the reason I picked up a rifle to kill you people? - it's because of, you know, Guantanamo Bay. MARTIN: So when ISIS beheads people. . . KELLY: Yeah. MARTIN: . . . Who wear orange jumpsuits. . . KELLY: Yeah. MARTIN: You don't see a parallel? KELLY: No, no. I mean, I would say that our actions against the extremists - bombing them and killing them - would kind of be more of a reason to hate us than keeping some of their colleagues in a great detention facility at Guantanamo Bay. MARTIN: So based on the threats that the United States faces now, do you think that the U. S. should have a detention facility like Guantanamo, whether in Cuba or on U. S. soil? KELLY: We need a place - in any conflict - to hold people that are captured on the battlefield. Prisoners are better than dead bodies because they talk. And you don't have to waterboard them. You don't have to - they talk. And we find out a wealth of knowledge, so you need to have a place to keep them somewhere. And certainly the care - the, you know, dignified and humane care they receive in Guantanamo Bay right now is very, very, very good. MARTIN: Lee Wolosky says there are 36 detainees who've been approved for transfer, and he's confident he can find countries to take them in by this summer. That leaves 55 detainees. Some of them are still being tried in military commissions. And the remaining detainees are waiting for review boards that will decide if they'll be sent home or resettled somewhere else. Any other detainees will need to be kept somewhere, and the Pentagon has identified 13 sites on U. S. soil that could house them. The administration has tried this before. In 2009, they explored the idea of moving detainees to U. S. facilities in states including Kansas, Illinois and Michigan. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: The administration is considering a plan to move all of the detainees currently held at the Guantanamo Bay prison to the maximum security lockup in Standish. It would turn that town into what some are calling Gitmo North. MARTIN: In the end, many residents in those states didn't want that to happen, and Congress wouldn't change the law to allow the detainees to move to the U. S. I asked Lee Wolosky what has changed since then. Why is he any more confident that Congress will change its mind on one of the most contentious issues of our time? WOLOSKY: As the president said last week, the issue of closing Guantanamo had been a bipartisan issue. There had been bipartisan consensus at the beginning of this administration to close Guantanamo. President Bush said he wanted to close Guantanamo, and he set in motion the closure of Guantanamo. On President Bush's watch, over 500 detainees, as part of a closure plan, were transferred to other countries. So if there is an interest and a willingness to close Guantanamo and there is an interest and willingness in not releasing certain detainees who cannot be safely released, then the alternative is to bring that small number of detainees to the United States. MARTIN: You think it'll happen before the end of the administration? WOLOSKY: I certainly do. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)MARTIN: Lee Wolosky is the top U. S. envoy for closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay. We also heard from retired Marine Corps General John Kelly and former Guantanamo Bay detainee Omar Deghayes. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:   This is WEEKEND EDITION from NPR News. I'm Rachel Martin. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MARTIN: And this is For the Record. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MARTIN: President Obama has been talking about closing the prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, since he ran for president in 2008. Here he is on \"60 Minutes\" two weeks after that election. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"60 MINUTES\") PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: I have said repeatedly that I intend to close Guantanamo, and I will follow through on that. MARTIN: Now, eight years later, his administration has put out a plan to make it happen. Here's the president announcing it last month. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) OBAMA: With this plan, we have the opportunity, finally, to eliminate a terrorist propaganda tool, strengthen relationships with allies and partners, enhance our national security and, most importantly, uphold the values that define us as Americans. MARTIN: The plan is to transfer some of the remaining detainees to other countries. And those who can't be transferred would be moved to a facility in the U. S. And that's the part of the plan many in Congress are railing against. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PAUL RYAN: The president should rule out taking unilateral action to transfer Guantanamo Bay detainees to our shores. TIM SCOTT: We're afraid that those terrorists will bring their friends to our neighborhoods. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: It's dangerous, irresponsible. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: I just really think that we must continue to detain prisoners there at Guantanamo. . . MARTIN: It's not just lawmakers who don't like the president's plan. On Friday, a new CNN ORC poll found that 56 percent of Americans surveyed opposed shutting down the U. S. prison at Guantanamo Bay. For the Record today, closing Gitmo. We're going to bring you two different perspectives on the U. S. prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba - President Obama's top envoy on the issue and the Marine Corps general who just retired after overseeing the facility. But first. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST) OMAR DEGHAYES: My name is Omar Deghayes. I'm a lawyer. I graduated from law school here in the U. K. And I was locked up in Guantanamo for about five years, several months - from 2002 to 2007. MARTIN: Omar Deghayes is one of hundreds of detainees who've been released from the U. S. prison at Guantanamo Bay over the years. Deghayes was apprehended in Pakistan in 2002. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST) DEGHAYES: In my case, there was a mistaken identity. They had a photograph of a Chechen rebel, and they thought that was me. MARTIN: I spoke with Deghayes back into 2013, and he described several hunger strikes he participated in while he was detained. I asked him how they got started. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST) DEGHAYES: Usually, it's a small incident - not small, but something grave takes place inside the camp. But that triggers other feelings - thinking about why we've been there for many, many years inside those prisons without any chance to look at the evidence, or there is no hope. All that - it comes together. And then it's a cry of help to the outside world. Usually, is that - it's the last resort. MARTIN: A last resort to get his case heard. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST) DEGHAYES: We want our imprisonment to come to an end. We want proper courts to have our cases listened to in courts so that a final decision is made. And those who've committed anything can be convicted and imprisoned. And those who haven't committed anything should be released. MARTIN: That was the experience of one detainee more than a decade ago in the early years of U. S. wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. During that time, the U. S. government was using so-called enhanced interrogation techniques at Gitmo, including sleep deprivation, slapping and nudity. After the abuses came to light, President George W. Bush signed something called the Detainee Treatment Act in 2005, which prevents, quote, \"cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment\" of any prisoner of the U. S. government, including those at Guantanamo Bay. Today, there are 91 detainees left. JOHN KELLY: And the facilities they live in today are pretty good. Again, I wouldn't want to be a detainee, but if you have to be a detainee somewhere, Gitmo's the place to be. MARTIN: This is General John Kelly. He's the retired four-star Marine Corps general who oversaw the prison at Guantanamo Bay from 2012 until this past January. General Kelly insists that the detainees hold a lot of power because they can provoke their guards, and the guards can't retaliate. He described something called splashing. And just a note here, this is a graphic discussion. KELLY: Detainees frequently will mix up a concoction - typically of feces, urine and - for some reason, sperm is the special treat, I guess, from their perspective. And they put that into a concoction. And then when the guards will go and either give them their food or open the door to bring them out, they get splashed. And so they get a face full of feces and urine and all the rest of it. You know that, by law, is an assault. Nothing we can do to them. The only way we could control them in any way is to either give them privileges or take privileges away. But the point is, when they've been in our custody, they've been taken care of because the law requires it, and we're the good guys. They're not, but we are. But the. . .

She will be honored tonight at the Kennedy Center here in Washington by the group Vital Voices. She's an Iraqi woman. Her fight began at home, as NPR's Michele Kelemen found out. MICHELE KELEMEN, BYLINE: Khanim Latif was just about 12 years old when her father forced her 14-year-old sister into marriage. That was a moment that changed her life. KHANIM LATIF: And when she left the school and get married, I upset - really upset - and give me a strong pain. I have to change something in my house and inside my family. And I don't let myself and other sister, which we have, to be like her. KELEMEN: She started reading books about women's rights and became an activist not just inside her family but in her community. At age 45, she now runs a nonprofit called ASUDA, which has a shelter and a hotline for women in need. LATIF: I'm fighting everyone in tradition, religion, conservative groups set up in the first shelter, independent shelter, which is very taboo in this time. KELEMEN: Khanim Latif is from northern Iraq, a mainly Kurdish area that's often viewed as a fairly moderate part of the country. But she says she's faced a lot of pressure over the years from religious and community leaders as she protects women and girls from honor killings and helps victims of domestic abuse. LATIF: To be the activist - to be the activist not belong the rich family, not belong the political party, not belong the famous family, it's very difficult. I built myself by myself. KELEMEN: Her group is now trying to cope with a massive influx of people fleeing ISIS. They are providing psychological care to women and girls who were held captive by the group. The U. S. has been supporting Kurdish fighters who are battling ISIS, and the U. S. is supporting groups like hers, too. LATIF: Fighting terrorism group like ISIS is not just about fighting this group. It's about how you'll build your society. And we could not do alone. We need the support from the State Department, from the United States. KELEMEN: Her award from Vital Voices should help her fundraising efforts here in the U. S. It's also bringing her closer to her sister, the one who was forced into child marriage. She says her sister is more traditional and never liked her activism but did offer her congratulations on her award. LATIF: Yesterday she calling me and she said, I am proud of you. This make me very prideful. KELEMEN: Her sister is still married to the same man and has seven children. Khanim Latif says she married late in life and now has a 2-year-old daughter.

He said that to Jeffrey Goldberg of The Atlantic. Obama spoke of a choice he made in 2013. He backed away from ordering an attack on Syria. The president did not enforce a red line he had been understood to draw against Syria's use of chemical weapons. Jeffrey Goldberg says this is how the president talks of that decision now. JEFFREY GOLDBERG: Pretty much the worst reason to bomb someone is to prove that you're willing to bomb someone. INSKEEP: Obama spoke with Goldberg in the White House and even aboard Air Force One, the president settled on a couch as the plane descended toward Kuala Lumpur. Both the president and his critics think a lot about that Syria decision in 2013. It's on their minds even though Syria's government finally did agree to surrender chemical weapons. Why did you think it was important to dig in and better understand that foreign policy decision a couple years later? More than that, even? GOLDBERG: Because he told me that this was a hinge moment of his presidency. He suggested this very strongly to me, that this was the moment that he, quote, \"Broke with the Washington playbook,\" end quote. And I asked him what he meant by the Washington playbook, and he says, you know, there's literally a playbook on the shelf in the foreign policy establishment in the Pentagon, in the State Department that says if country X does this, then the United States does Y. And he believes that the playbook is over-militarized, that - and it's kind of a cruise missile playbook. If these people do this, then I'm going to fire this missile at them. He believes that the playbook also holds that the U. S. is responsible for management of the Middle East. And that's another core aspect of the Obama doctrine, is to question that underlying assumption that we've made for three decades or more that this is our main responsibility in the world - is to keep this under management. And so at that moment in 2013, a lot of different things are welling up inside of him. There's practical political considerations obviously, but there's also these broader themes, which is like, I don't want to be the manager of the Middle East. And so this is what he's thinking in that moment. And when he made that decision, he thought, I've finally broken with the Washington playbook. INSKEEP: You are delivering news to us here, Jeffery Goldberg, because this is a decision that had been endlessly criticized by the president's critics. . . GOLDBERG: Yes. INSKEEP: . . . As a moment of weakness. Even the president's supporters have said they did not. . . GOLDBERG: . . . Many ex-Cabinet members. . . INSKEEP: . . . Have said, I did not believe in that decision. They've said that again and again and again; that this was a failure, that this cost American credibility in the world. GOLDBERG: Right. INSKEEP: You're saying that the president not only defends that decision, but believes it was a success. GOLDBERG: The quote from the president - and I was somewhat taken aback the first time I heard him say this - is he's very proud of this moment. He's very proud of the moment he decided not to do the thing that everyone seemed to want him to do. So you can interpret this two ways. One is that's true. The other is that this is a master politician at work, and he's kind of doing a little bit of jujitsu - in other words, telling people, the moment that you think is my weakest moment as president is actually my best moment as president. INSKEEP: And yet you portray a president who is bothered that people do continue to focus on that moment of drawing the red line and then not. . . GOLDBERG: Yes. INSKEEP: . . . Not striking out. You've got a quote here that I wrote down - nobody remembers bin Laden anymore, the president says to you. Nobody talks about ordering me 30,000 more troops into Afghanistan. The red line crisis, he said, is the point of the inverted pyramid upon which all other theories rest. GOLDBERG: Right. INSKEEP: What did he mean by that? GOLDBERG: He's clearly bothered by the fact that people think of him as a weak national security president. And his argument is - and this is true, what I'm about to say - is this president who has this reputation is the greatest terrorist hunter in the history of the American presidency. I mean, we just saw in the last week the 150 militants in Somalia wiped out by a U. S. strike. Who ordered that strike? There's a record there, and he. . . INSKEEP: . . . This is a guy who used drones in ways that many people. . . GOLDBERG: . . . This is a guy who has killed terrorists in seven or eight different countries. INSKEEP: There have been arguments made here in Washington that maybe this was the right decision for Syria, maybe it was the wrong decision for Syria, but that there are consequences that the president drew a red line, somebody defied that, and that the United States did not attack. Have there been larger consequences, negative consequences, for the United States? GOLDBERG: We won't know for years, I think. INSKEEP: Does the president acknowledge that there were larger consequences? GOLDBERG: The president does not believe in these credibility arguments the way a lot of people in the foreign policy establishment believe it. He does not believe that people are no longer scared of the United States. He believes, for instance, that Iran made the deal on nuclear weapons that it did because it understands the power of the United States. INSKEEP: Let me ask you about one more word. It's a word you chose to describe the president after sitting with him so many times. Why do you describe the president as fatalistic? GOLDBERG: One of the surprising things in these conversations was how fatalistic he is about the Middle East, especially considering where he was when he started as president. You know, one of his big first speeches was a speech in Cairo which was meant to reset relations with the Muslim world. And he had a lot of hope for the peace process, he had a lot of hope for transition and during the Arab Spring - the first days of the Arab Spring. But he has come to the conclusion that there's nothing that the United States can do. Nothing that would change systems in the Middle East, nothing the United States can do that would make the Middle East a better place. He believes it's a generational problem. He believes that the forces of fundamentalism and tribalism are so strong in the Middle East that the U. S. would be foolish to try to shape that region. INSKEEP: Jeffrey Goldberg's article based on several interviews with President Obama is in the Atlantic. Jeffrey, thanks very much. GOLDBERG: Thank you. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:   President Obama contends his biggest foreign policy mistake was actually a success. He said that to Jeffrey Goldberg of The Atlantic. Obama spoke of a choice he made in 2013. He backed away from ordering an attack on Syria. The president did not enforce a red line he had been understood to draw against Syria's use of chemical weapons.

INSKEEP: And yet you portray a president who is bothered that people do continue to focus on that moment of drawing the red line and then not. . . GOLDBERG: Yes. INSKEEP: . . . Not striking out. You've got a quote here that I wrote down - nobody remembers bin Laden anymore, the president says to you. Nobody talks about ordering me 30,000 more troops into Afghanistan. The red line crisis, he said, is the point of the inverted pyramid upon which all other theories rest. GOLDBERG: Right. INSKEEP: What did he mean by that? GOLDBERG: He's clearly bothered by the fact that people think of him as a weak national security president. And his argument is - and this is true, what I'm about to say - is this president who has this reputation is the greatest terrorist hunter in the history of the American presidency. I mean, we just saw in the last week the 150 militants in Somalia wiped out by a U. S. strike. Who ordered that strike? There's a record there, and he. . . INSKEEP: . . . This is a guy who used drones in ways that many people. . . GOLDBERG: . . . This is a guy who has killed terrorists in seven or eight different countries. INSKEEP: There have been arguments made here in Washington that maybe this was the right decision for Syria, maybe it was the wrong decision for Syria, but that there are consequences that the president drew a red line, somebody defied that, and that the United States did not attack. Have there been larger consequences, negative consequences, for the United States? GOLDBERG: We won't know for years, I think. INSKEEP: Does the president acknowledge that there were larger consequences? GOLDBERG: The president does not believe in these credibility arguments the way a lot of people in the foreign policy establishment believe it. He does not believe that people are no longer scared of the United States. He believes, for instance, that Iran made the deal on nuclear weapons that it did because it understands the power of the United States. INSKEEP: Let me ask you about one more word. It's a word you chose to describe the president after sitting with him so many times. Why do you describe the president as fatalistic? GOLDBERG: One of the surprising things in these conversations was how fatalistic he is about the Middle East, especially considering where he was when he started as president. You know, one of his big first speeches was a speech in Cairo which was meant to reset relations with the Muslim world. And he had a lot of hope for the peace process, he had a lot of hope for transition and during the Arab Spring - the first days of the Arab Spring. But he has come to the conclusion that there's nothing that the United States can do. Nothing that would change systems in the Middle East, nothing the United States can do that would make the Middle East a better place. He believes it's a generational problem. He believes that the forces of fundamentalism and tribalism are so strong in the Middle East that the U. S. would be foolish to try to shape that region. INSKEEP: Jeffrey Goldberg's article based on several interviews with President Obama is in the Atlantic. Jeffrey, thanks very much.

Did you solve that problem that we reported last week? BLOCK: Oh, yeah. SANJER: So it's not, like, just getting it done and then we say, OK, it's gone. BLOCK: Well, why do you figure the government officials are taking your calls and responding in a public way and being held accountable that way? SANJER: Because we make fun of them if they don't pick up our phones. BLOCK: (Laughter) You're shaming them. SANJER: (Laughter) Yeah. For example, one day a spokesperson didn't pick up, so we started making fun of them. I said maybe he's sleeping because he's a government official. The government doesn't work. So the next spokesperson we called, he, like, right away picks up and this was, like, I'm always picking up your phone. We will always help people.

I said, OK, where are you exactly? He says, I'm, like, a hundred meters away from the police post. I said, don't cut the phone. Just leave the phone on. We'll broadcast it live. And then this police came to the guy and says, give me, like, 100 or 500 Afs or whatever was it. And everyone was listening to this. BLOCK: Oh, so you heard the actual bribe transaction on the radio. SANJER: Yeah, yeah, yeah, this is, like, the conversation between the police and their driver was broadcasted live on our show. And then we called the ministry of interior. We said, did you listen to the show? They said, yes, we were listening. And the police were arrested. And so we do, like, bring very big changes in terms of corruption and all that.

Makiya later acknowledged authorship and became an advocate for the dictator's ouster. Well, now he's written a new book - a novel - published in both Arabic and English and set in Iraq right after the U. S. invasion. It follows a Shiite militiaman from the day that Saddam Hussein fell to the day he was hanged. It's called \"The Rope\" after the rope that was used for the execution, an execution that Makiya says was flawed. KANAN MAKIYA: When I heard the report, I remember I was sick for a day. I was utterly disgusted. And I felt how he was killed, how - and how he died, he had dignity. SIEGEL: This was a man whose mass murders you had documented at a time when you were alone out there virtually. MAKIYA: He's a great mass murderer, and he believes in what he is and he died well. What can we say? And the men who killed him killed him in what was more of a lynching than an actual execution. They behaved badly. This doesn't change for one moment the character or the nature of Saddam as a political person. But it's deeply reflective of the new regime that's about to come into power. So I use Saddam in the purely fictional part of this book as a kind of mirror of the Iraqi ruling elite. He's explaining the rules by which men rule. And until those rules are questioned from within, we're always going to have - one Saddam will be replaced by another Saddam or by many little Saddams - a thousand little Saddams, which is the situation we have today. SIEGEL: Kanan Makiya, you're no stranger to controversy over things that you've either done or written about Iraq. In this book, there are moments when I'm wondering, are you saying that Iraq has descended to a point - and to a point of violence - that is as bad or worse than it was under Saddam Hussein? Are you - do you regret the past 25 years? I mean, how close are you coming to saying things are that bad? MAKIYA: Things are very bad. But I can't change my positions because of how bad they have become now. Things were also equally or very bad under Saddam. There was no future. Once the future was made possible, Iraqis did the worst possible job out of it. They went from bad to worse. That means I'm part of that failure. I've got to argue and criticize \"my own,\" quote, unquote, because I have to deal with the fact that they failed. SIEGEL: But when you say that, Kanan, you are both an Iraqi and an American. I mean, you spend more of your life here. When you say that, are you talking about the Iraqi part of you that are Iraqis and Shiite Iraqis failed in this. . . MAKIYA: Yes, you're absolutely right. I've lived with that dichotomy - that contradiction - for a very long period of time. I felt with passion the pain of Iraqis under Saddam, and I couldn't help but feel that. When I went into Kurdistan 25 years ago and covered the Anfal, I was in a state of shock. SIEGEL: The Anfal was sort of the campaign - it was a mass murder against the Kurds. MAKIYA: Of the Kurds, yes. I mean, I knew he'd done terrible things, but I had not understood, felt in - with my bones, so to speak, the scale of the disasters. I've seen the destroyed villages, the concreted wells, the burial sites and so on. To see that with your eyes and then to feel it was - came from somebody who felt like a part of himself was complicit in this and he had to do something about it. And the only thing he could do was talk to you, write a book, do that kind of a thing. So I don't regret any of that. And I wouldn't not do that for a second. And I wouldn't say that Saddam has to stay because something worse may follow. That's a cynical point of view on life and the world. I say that I believe that something else is possible - is imaginable - and I will do my level best to work towards that which is imaginable. And if I fail along the way, at least I tried. SIEGEL: What do you most want people to get out of reading this novel, whether in English or in Arabic for that matter? MAKIYA: Well, I want it to underline the failure of the Iraqi elite and our responsibility for that failure. I want Iraqis to look at themselves and not say this is all the fault of ISIS or all the fault of al-Qaida and so on. I am responsible for why this thing went as bad as it did. And I'm trying to break out of the sectarian divide and morass, if you like, that has - governs the way people talk about politics. SIEGEL: And your English readers? MAKIYA: My English readers - I want to understand that it went wrong and who I hold responsible for why it went wrong, including myself. SIEGEL: Kanan Makiya, author most recently of the novel \"The Rope,\" thank you very much for talking with us once again. MAKIYA: Thank you, Robert.

It's called \"The Rope\" after the rope that was used for the execution, an execution that Makiya says was flawed. KANAN MAKIYA: When I heard the report, I remember I was sick for a day. I was utterly disgusted. And I felt how he was killed, how - and how he died, he had dignity. SIEGEL: This was a man whose mass murders you had documented at a time when you were alone out there virtually. MAKIYA: He's a great mass murderer, and he believes in what he is and he died well. What can we say? And the men who killed him killed him in what was more of a lynching than an actual execution. They behaved badly. This doesn't change for one moment the character or the nature of Saddam as a political person. But it's deeply reflective of the new regime that's about to come into power. So I use Saddam in the purely fictional part of this book as a kind of mirror of the Iraqi ruling elite. He's explaining the rules by which men rule. And until those rules are questioned from within, we're always going to have - one Saddam will be replaced by another Saddam or by many little Saddams - a thousand little Saddams, which is the situation we have today. SIEGEL: Kanan Makiya, you're no stranger to controversy over things that you've either done or written about Iraq. In this book, there are moments when I'm wondering, are you saying that Iraq has descended to a point - and to a point of violence - that is as bad or worse than it was under Saddam Hussein? Are you - do you regret the past 25 years? I mean, how close are you coming to saying things are that bad? MAKIYA: Things are very bad. But I can't change my positions because of how bad they have become now. Things were also equally or very bad under Saddam. There was no future. Once the future was made possible, Iraqis did the worst possible job out of it. They went from bad to worse. That means I'm part of that failure. I've got to argue and criticize \"my own,\" quote, unquote, because I have to deal with the fact that they failed. SIEGEL: But when you say that, Kanan, you are both an Iraqi and an American. I mean, you spend more of your life here. When you say that, are you talking about the Iraqi part of you that are Iraqis and Shiite Iraqis failed in this. . . MAKIYA: Yes, you're absolutely right. I've lived with that dichotomy - that contradiction - for a very long period of time. I felt with passion the pain of Iraqis under Saddam, and I couldn't help but feel that. When I went into Kurdistan 25 years ago and covered the Anfal, I was in a state of shock. SIEGEL: The Anfal was sort of the campaign - it was a mass murder against the Kurds. MAKIYA: Of the Kurds, yes. I mean, I knew he'd done terrible things, but I had not understood, felt in - with my bones, so to speak, the scale of the disasters. I've seen the destroyed villages, the concreted wells, the burial sites and so on. To see that with your eyes and then to feel it was - came from somebody who felt like a part of himself was complicit in this and he had to do something about it. And the only thing he could do was talk to you, write a book, do that kind of a thing. So I don't regret any of that. And I wouldn't not do that for a second. And I wouldn't say that Saddam has to stay because something worse may follow. That's a cynical point of view on life and the world. I say that I believe that something else is possible - is imaginable - and I will do my level best to work towards that which is imaginable. And if I fail along the way, at least I tried. SIEGEL: What do you most want people to get out of reading this novel, whether in English or in Arabic for that matter? MAKIYA: Well, I want it to underline the failure of the Iraqi elite and our responsibility for that failure. I want Iraqis to look at themselves and not say this is all the fault of ISIS or all the fault of al-Qaida and so on. I am responsible for why this thing went as bad as it did. And I'm trying to break out of the sectarian divide and morass, if you like, that has - governs the way people talk about politics. SIEGEL: And your English readers? MAKIYA: My English readers - I want to understand that it went wrong and who I hold responsible for why it went wrong, including myself. SIEGEL: Kanan Makiya, author most recently of the novel \"The Rope,\" thank you very much for talking with us once again. MAKIYA: Thank you, Robert.", "section": "Author Interviews", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Crude oil prices have sunk to 13-year lows of $30 a barrel. There's another benefit you probably can't see - piracy off the coast of West Africa is down, too. The number of attacks on oil tankers in the Gulf of Guinea has fallen a third since last year. Agencies that track these numbers say piracy is no longer such a profitable business. Bolaji Akinola keeps track of the maritime industry in West Africa as an industry analyst. We reached him in Lagos via Skype. He says, there used to be a great deal of oil theft in the Gulf of Guinea when crude was trading at more than $100 barrel, and then he talked about Nigeria, specifically. BOLAJI AKINOLA: Nigeria was losing as much as 500,000 barrels of oil per day. That is a quarter of what it is able to sell to the international community. MARTIN: Do you attribute the drop in the number of attacks on oil tankers to the drop in oil prices? Do you think that there's a connection? AKINOLA: Certainly, there is a connection. Since the price dropped, there has been a decline in piracy and the numbers are there. The low oil price is a deterrence. It's not much of a worthwhile venture any longer. MARTIN: Are there other reasons why the number of attacks may also be down, in addition to the drop in oil prices? AKINOLA: Certainly, there are other reasons. The first other reason is the setting up of the Maritime Piracy Reporting Centre under the Gulf of Guinea Commission. What that has done is to enable vessels to report incidents of attacks. And the other key reason has been increased patrol by the navies of the countries in the Gulf of Guinea region. MARTIN: So what does this Piracy Reporting Centre do? Do people report the attacks after the fact or do they report when they think they're about to be attacked? AKINOLA: So you call for help when you come under attack. Not too long ago, I think early February, a vessel under attack was able to make a call, and the Nigerian navy was on a - taking a patrol within that area. It quickly responded, and it was able to repel the attacks. And the pirates took to the hills; they ran away. MARTIN: So how are the pirates adapting to all this? You know, I hate to put it this way, but they're business people. Are they going into other crimes? AKINOLA: Now they are kidnapping crew members and then holding them for ransom, the kind of piracy that we saw in the Somalia area, in the Gulf of Aden. In fact, in February, they targeted the (unintelligible) vessel with the aim of taking one or two crewmembers hostage and then asking for ransom. MARTIN: You know, maritime work is still dangerous in this area, it seems to me. Is there discussion about what a long-term solution to this would be? AKINOLA: In the long-run, there is a need to provide employment for youth, especially in the Niger Delta area of Nigeria. I hope you are aware of the fact that piracy in the larger Gulf of Guinea area has been blamed on Nigerian pirates. So until you are able to meaningfully engage this category of people, they will continue to constitute danger to shipping. MARTIN: Bolaji Akinola is a maritime industry analyst.

We'll check in on a new development in France near the northern coastal city of Dunkirk. There, the French government has refused to fund a refugee camp, so Mayor Damien Careme turned elsewhere. He turned to the international medical charity MSF, known here as Doctors Without Borders. Although the group is known mainly for providing medical care in conflict zones and under-served areas, MSF and the mayor worked together to raise funds not just to build a camp, but one that would alleviate conditions that have become notorious elsewhere. The camp, which has been open for about two weeks, features cabins, not just tents, to protect refugees from cold weather and flooding. It also includes more showers and bathrooms. Advocates say the camp is the first in France to meet humanitarian standards, but that has set off another debate with those who fear the camp will encourage refugees to stay too long. We wanted to hear more about the place, so we've called Angelique Muller. She's a field coordinator for MSF in the French suburb of Grande-Synthe just outside of Dunkirk, and we reached her via Skype. Hello, Angelique. Thanks for joining us. ANGELIQUE MULLER: Welcome. Thank you, too. MARTIN: So why did MSF agree to undertake this project? MULLER: We agreed because it was a humanitarian emergency. When the mayor asked the government last year to support the migrants, that they were living in this quite horrific camp, the government said no. And we agreed to support because for us it was a crisis, a humanitarian crisis. MARTIN: Do you mind sharing what some of the conditions were before that you were trying to correct? MULLER: A lot of pregnant women, a lot of families and a lot of children that were living in the mud with not enough water, with only 44 toilets for a population - that there almost 2,500 people. Just few showers - 20, 24 showers. MARTIN: The camp is being described as one of the first - or the first in France - built to meet international humanitarian standards. Could you describe a little bit about what that means? MULLER: So it means that the site of the camp, it was for 2,500 people linked to the emergency of last year. So it's linked to this number that we plan to do a huge number of toilets, of showers, of water points. So it means that we have one toilet for 20 people, we have one shower for 40 people - is the standard that we are working with in all international refugee camps. MARTIN: What do you say to those who say that it may sound harsh, but that if the conditions improved that people will have less reason to move on? MULLER: The goals of all people there on the field in Grande-Synthe, it's to reach the U. K. It's really this. So even if you welcome them in the perfect structure - that is not the pretension and is not the case - they don't want to stay in France. They want to go in U. K. because they have family. So in all the cases, they don't want to stay. MARTIN: That's Angelique Muller. She's a field coordinator for MSF, known as Doctors Without Borders in the U. S.

SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Good morning, Rachel. MARTIN: This is going to be a crazy scene - right? - when the president lands in Havana. HORSLEY: When that 747 with the United States of America painted on the side touches down at Jose Marti Airport, it is going to be a big deal. He's the first president to come here since Calvin Coolidge. And his national security adviser, Susan Rice, says this is the culmination of a diplomatic thaw that was first announced 15 months ago but that reverses half a century of official isolation. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)SUSAN RICE: Today, the American flag flies over our reopened embassy in Cuba. More Americans are visiting Cuba than at any time in the last 50 years. More American companies are looking to invest in Cuba. HORSLEY: This opening to Cuba is certainly one of this president's major foreign-policy initiatives, along with the Iranian nuclear deal. And like that controversial agreement, this outreach to Cuba required setting aside decades of hostility and trying to find some common ground. MARTIN: So polls show a majority of Americans support all this outreach to Cuba, but not everyone's celebrating. There's still some opposition in Congress, and the formal embargo is still in place, right? HORSLEY: Absolutely, although the White House is lobbying lawmakers to lift the embargo. But Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan says Congress is not budging. Ryan said just a few days ago the embargo remains the law of the land. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)REPRESENTATIVE PAUL RYAN: The Castro regime has been guilty of countless human rights abuses. This is a regime that provides safe harbor to terrorists and to fugitives. Unfortunately, it is doubtful that the president will bring up the need for reform during his visit. HORSLEY: Actually, the White House says that Obama will raise the issue of human rights abuses when he meets tomorrow with President Raul Castro. He's also holding a separate meeting on Tuesday with a group of Cuban dissidents. There have been some reports of dissidents being harassed and detained in the days leading up to the president's visit. Unfortunately, that's not uncommon here. MARTIN: I understand, obviously, there's going to be a lot of business on this trip, but a little pleasure too. The president is going to meet with some Cuban entrepreneurs, and then he's going to go see a little baseball. HORSLEY: Yeah, baseball diplomacy will be in full force during this visit. Obviously, it's a favorite pastime in both countries. It's a symbol of the long history the United States shares with Cuba. So the Tampa Bay Rays will be playing an exhibition game here in Havana against the Cuban national team. But even that is not all fun and games. Major League Baseball is in talks with the Cuban government on a deal that would allow Cuban ballplayers to play for major league teams without having to defect first. And the Treasury Department cleared the way for that last week. That is one of many steps the administration has taken to whittle away at the embargo and to promote travel and trade with Cuba. MARTIN: All that has led to a spike in the number of Americans who are visiting Cuba. But I gather there haven't necessarily been a lot of similar changes made on the Cuban side? HORSLEY: No, and there are some skeptics who say that the president really should have waited to do this trip until there had been more movement from the Cubans. The administration, though, says the time was ripe. And even if Cuba doesn't move, they argue, this diplomatic outreach was the right move for the administration to make. The decades-old policy of trying to isolate Cuba was very unpopular in the rest of Latin America and had the perverse effect of isolating the United States. MARTIN: NPR's Scott Horsley in Havana.

Research from the country's Native Women's Association estimates that as many as 4,000 native women may have gone missing or been murdered in the last three decades. An earlier study by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police put that figure closer to 1,200. The Canadian government has now begun a formal inquiry into the situation. Carolyn Bennett is the Canadian minister of Indigenous and Northern Affairs. And she joins us from New York. Thanks for being with us. CAROLYN BENNETT: You're very welcome. MARTIN: Clearly, this is now something that the government thinks is troubling enough to launch its own investigation. What's the theory? Why do you think this is happening - all of these women going missing or being killed? BENNETT: Well, clearly in Canada the indigenous population, and particularly women, they are way overrepresented in the numbers that are murdered and/or have gone missing. Indigenous women are 4 percent of the population and 24 percent of those that are murdered. MARTIN: Can you give us a clearer picture of this demographic group? I mean, how well are they assimilated into the mainstream culture? What's their economic status like? What's the relationship to the authorities, to law enforcement? BENNETT: We have three distinct populations in Canada - First Nations, Inuit and Metis. They are increasingly moving to cities. But it is a huge problem in that we've also got more indigenous children in foster care than at the height of our tragedy of residential schools, when they were ripped from their families and put into boarding schools. So we know that assimilation is a bad idea. We know that children do well when there is a secure personal cultural identity - when they can be a proud Inuit young girl. And when that's taken from them and they no longer feel proud of that, they lose their sense of self, sense of control, and that they actually end up very vulnerable and at risk of terrible problems. We also are dealing with terrible problems in poverty and housing and educational attainment. MARTIN: Do you have any idea whether or not these alleged crimes - these deaths and disappearances - are happening - are being perpetuated by other members of the native population or outside of that population? BENNETT: Well, as you know, Rachel, most women die at the hands of someone they've known. In the indigenous population, it's a little bit less than in the non-indigenous population - a little bit more likely to be somebody that wasn't an intimate partner. But nonetheless, we know we've got to deal with child abuse that leads to addictions that leads to incarceration - is a huge issue both for men and women. We have learned through the hearings coast to coast to coast that there's been a very uneven application of justice in our country and that indigenous people are way overrepresented in the prisons. So we've got a lot of things that we have to deal with. MARTIN: Some of these cases, I understand, go back 30 years. BENNETT: Oh, indeed, and what we heard in the hearings is so sad because some of the cases were deemed a suicide or deemed an accident. And the investigation just wasn't done properly. And so the indigenous people in Canada felt that there was a completely uneven application of the justice system. MARTIN: So how is the investigation going to move forward? Will you be looking into cases that have been cold for decades? BENNETT: That's a deliberation. That's certainly what the families want - I think particularly the families who feel that the death of their loved one was deemed a suicide or an accident when they don't think so. There's a particularly tragic case where two young women - Maisy and Shannon - were deemed to be runaways, but their cell phones and their purses were left on the table. And the families know that there's no teenage girl that would leave their cell phone and their purse on the table if they were indeed about to run away. Another one of the deaths and one of the near-deaths were people - young women who were in the child-welfare system in a hotel in downtown Winnipeg with very little supervision. This is has captured the attention of Canadians. They know there's something really wrong going on, and I am honored that our prime minister has decided we have to get on and deal with it. MARTIN: Carolyn Bennett is Canada's minister of Indigenous and Northern Affairs. Thanks so much for talking with us about this. BENNETT: You're very welcome. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:  There is a strange thing happening in Canada. Research from the country's Native Women's Association estimates that as many as 4,000 native women may have gone missing or been murdered in the last three decades. An earlier study by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police put that figure closer to 1,200. The Canadian government has now begun a formal inquiry into the situation. Carolyn Bennett is the Canadian minister of Indigenous and Northern Affairs. And she joins us from New York. Thanks for being with us. CAROLYN BENNETT: You're very welcome. MARTIN: Clearly, this is now something that the government thinks is troubling enough to launch its own investigation. What's the theory? Why do you think this is happening - all of these women going missing or being killed? BENNETT: Well, clearly in Canada the indigenous population, and particularly women, they are way overrepresented in the numbers that are murdered and/or have gone missing. Indigenous women are 4 percent of the population and 24 percent of those that are murdered. MARTIN: Can you give us a clearer picture of this demographic group? I mean, how well are they assimilated into the mainstream culture? What's their economic status like? What's the relationship to the authorities, to law enforcement? BENNETT: We have three distinct populations in Canada - First Nations, Inuit and Metis. They are increasingly moving to cities. But it is a huge problem in that we've also got more indigenous children in foster care than at the height of our tragedy of residential schools, when they were ripped from their families and put into boarding schools. So we know that assimilation is a bad idea. We know that children do well when there is a secure personal cultural identity - when they can be a proud Inuit young girl. And when that's taken from them and they no longer feel proud of that, they lose their sense of self, sense of control, and that they actually end up very vulnerable and at risk of terrible problems. We also are dealing with terrible problems in poverty and housing and educational attainment. MARTIN: Do you have any idea whether or not these alleged crimes - these deaths and disappearances - are happening - are being perpetuated by other members of the native population or outside of that population? BENNETT: Well, as you know, Rachel, most women die at the hands of someone they've known. In the indigenous population, it's a little bit less than in the non-indigenous population - a little bit more likely to be somebody that wasn't an intimate partner. But nonetheless, we know we've got to deal with child abuse that leads to addictions that leads to incarceration - is a huge issue both for men and women. We have learned through the hearings coast to coast to coast that there's been a very uneven application of justice in our country and that indigenous people are way overrepresented in the prisons.

Here in the U. S. , security at airports is on high alert. Security experts, politicians and travelers say they're concerned about the weak spot the bombings exposed - the area between terminal entrances and screening checkpoint. From Chicago, here's NPR's David Schaper. DAVID SCHAPER, BYLINE: Just as there is at airports all across the country, there is an increased security and police presence here at Chicago's O'Hare Airport, but that doesn't mean that travelers are without concern. In fact, to some, the security measures don't go far enough. DAN CICERO: The more the better, in my case - you know, whatever it takes to keep us safe. SCHAPER: Forty-two-year-old Dan Cicero is traveling from Kentland, Ind. , Eau Claire, Wis. , on business. CICERO: I'm not talking, you know, guys with machine guns or anything like that, but, you know, more and maybe more of a police presence. SCHAPER: Fifty-year-old Lisa Paley, who is returning home to New Jersey from a business trip to Chicago, agrees airport security can be improved. LISA PALEY: I do think that we have good security, but the security is behind the point where that issue occurred yesterday at the airport, so I think you have to have some concern about what's happening. SCHAPER: The Brussels airport attackers exploded bombs in an area inside the terminal but before the security checkpoint lines. And Paley says that vulnerability is troubling. PALEY: I think we have to acknowledge we're in a situation which is always changing, and I think that they're going to have to continue to look at what security means at the airport. DANIEL WAGNER: I would suggest that we're more at risk than we think. SCHAPER: Daniel Wagner is CEO of the security consulting firm Country Risk Solutions. WAGNER: If you think about the way things were done in Brussels and have been done in other places, literally people have to only walk in, and they can attack at will. SCHAPER: In U. S. airports, the TSA is often not responsible for security at the curb and inside around those check-in kiosks and baggage check-in and claim areas, and that's a concern of Massachusetts Congressman Bill Keating, ranking Democrat on the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Terrorism. BILL KEATING: The implementation of that security runs right across the board. Sometimes it's private security. Sometimes it's local police hired out, paid for by the municipal or airport authority or whoever runs it. And that jurisdiction is not clear the way it should be. SCHAPER: Security consultant Wagner suggests U. S. airports establish pre-terminal screening before travelers enter the facility. WAGNER: That is a common approach in many countries around the world. You cannot even get in the terminal until your bags and your person have been prescreened. That is through an x-ray machine both for the bags and for the individual. SCHAPER: Enhancing security to that degree would be costly, and Wagner says he's not sure he sees a great enough sense of urgency yet for Americans to be willing to pay for it. In addition, such pre-terminal screening could create long lines outside of terminals and bottlenecks of traffic congestion. Again, Congressman Bill Keating. KEATING: What's more likely, given resources and the difficulty of doing that, is that there could be a random screening. SCHAPER: Keating says he requested a government accountability study on how to improve airport perimeter security a year ago, which he says will be released soon. But most experts agree it's nearly possible to make public airports completely secure from terrorist attacks, especially when those terrorists are willing to take their own lives when taking the lives of others.

Well, OK, I'm at the Place de la Bourse, which is this old stock exchange. It's an old building in the center. And this is where people have been coming since Tuesday to light candles, lay flowers and to write messages in chalk on the sidewalk. And so the march was supposed start here tomorrow, as you said, the March Against Fear, but officials have canceled it because they cannot guarantee security, they say. And I've been talking to people here and, you know, I actually announced the news to one guy, and he was extremely disappointed. He said, you know, I was going to come. This is a chance for all people of all religions to come out. I'm looking at banners that say no, not in the name Islam, you know, so he was disappointed. And then I spoke with another Belgian, and I think he put it the way people are feeling. He said, I'm torn. He said, on one hand, I'm very disappointed because I wanted to come out and march, he said, but I'm also increasingly angry when I hear that Belgian security, Belgian intelligence authorities, had clues that something like this could have happened. And they should've closed the metro and they haven't done what they should have done, he said, so in some ways, I think they're right. Something else could happen here and they don't want, you know, thousands of people gathering. So he said he was torn about the decision. SIMON: Now, I gather, just from someone who was - an assiduous reading of the newswires today, that a number of cancellations, high-profile cancellations, have occurred in Brussels - concerts, religious services. Do you know anything about that? BEARDSLEY: You know, Scott, I haven't heard that, but I tell you it is a little bit unsettling because in Paris after the attacks people immediately and spontaneously gathered and then they had an official march where millions showed up and no one canceled any of those. So it does make you think if they're not letting this go forward, you know, are there real fears that something else is in the planning? SIMON: Well, there - and I wonder what you can tell us in the 45 seconds we have left about anything new about the investigation and the number of apprehensions that have been made. BEARDSLEY: Absolutely. They've detained a number of people in raids for two days across the city. And today they filed formal charges against at least two people, and maybe it's three. It's consequently changing from, you know, terrorists to murder. And one of those people Belgian media is speculating is that third person from the surveillance video footage at the airport, the three guys with their trolley and their bags. They say that he's the third one they've just filed charges against. SIMON: Eleanor Beardsley. . . BEARDSLEY: But we don't have that confirmed yet.

That's why that it's not only European institutions who are the victim. I think we are all the victim - the European one, but the citizen one, the world citizen, one. SIMON: Is it still impossible to begin the day without thinking about what happened in Brussels? Does the attack kind of dictate everyday life in terms of where people go, how they act, how they feel? FOULON: When you have this kind of terrorist attack, of course, your life is a bit different. Of course, you wake up with this story in mind, but I think, also, that we have to learn how to live now, daily, with this threat - exactly what doing the people who are living in Paris, as in other countries who were attacked by the terrorists. We have now to live with this reality. But we have continued to stay alive. We have continued to have a normal life and to keep it in mind.

Authorities there continue to issue arrest warrants. At least seven people are currently being held in custody due to possible links to the Brussels or Paris attacks. Today, Belgian prosecutors charged another man in connection with the Tuesday bombings. And meanwhile, police raids are ongoing throughout the city. We go now to Eleanor Beardsley, who is in Brussels. Eleanor, thanks for being with us. ELEANOR BEARDSLEY, BYLINE: Good to be with you, Scott. SIMON: What do we know about this latest statement from Belgian officials that somebody else has been charged? BEARDSLEY: Right, they formally charged a man with terrorist murders. They've given a first name but not a last - Faycal C (ph). But the Belgian media is speculating that this is the mystery man, the missing man wearing the white coat and the hat at the Brussels airport. You remember the grainy camera footage of three men. SIMON: Yeah, surveillance video. BEARDSLEY: He's the one that left - yeah, surveillance video - he left his bomb and, you know, left the airport. And Belgian media is speculating that it's him, but it has not yet been confirmed by prosecutors. SIMON: And tell us about these raids that have been continuing all around Brussels. BEARDSLEY: Yeah, they went on all across the city starting Thursday night and all day yesterday. People are really on edge. And some of them took place in the Schaerbeek neighborhood in Brussels. Now, remember, that's where two - those two suicide brother bombers were living and the taxi driver picked up three men that morning and took them to the airport. And he became suspicious when they wouldn't let him help them with their bags because there were bombs in their bags. So he went to the police - the taxi driver did - and that's how they found their apartment and all the explosives. So I went there and. . . SIMON: Sounds like maybe we have lost our Eleanor Beardsley in Brussels. Sounds like the - perhaps the line has dropped. I think - did - let me check in our control room. Do we have the audio earlier? Eleanor spoke with a woman named Martine Bauthier who let her come up to the apartment and she told Eleanor what she saw. We have that audio now. BEARDSLEY: And do you believe that these men are coming out of your city? MARTINE BAUTHIER: Yeah, it's too - too much people. It's too much (speaking French). They don't have the same life to us. It's impossible. SIMON: And this woman continues in French. She said her English was not good enough, and she told Eleanor that she thought there'd been a huge negligence among Belgian politicians whom she believes have let too many immigrants into Belgium. And she told Eleanor that now the country's overwhelmed and she sees it's really too late. I'm told we have Eleanor Beardsley back. Eleanor, are you there? BEARDSLEY: Scott, I'm back. Sorry about that connection. SIMON: That's all right. These things happen. It's Easter weekend. I wonder if you could tell us what life is like in the Belgian capital. BEARDSLEY: Well, you know, people are out. People want to go back to work, they want to get their lives back. But it's still kind of jarring to see scenes of soldiers checking people before they go into the Brussels Metro. I took the Brussels Metro today and there was plenty of people in it. It felt normal. But, Scott, the airport is still closed through Tuesday for forensic work, and they haven't finished identifying the victims and also to reconstruct that terminal. And there's supposed to be a peace march tomorrow. And they've asked for people not to bring bags. SIMON: They don't want to - they don't want to create more of a security problem. And there must be some concern about a large group of people in any case. BEARDSLEY: Exactly. They're checking bags everywhere. Everyone is on edge even though they want - you know, it's a sunny day, people want to feel that it's Easter weekend, but there's still a feeling - an unsettled feeling - that things are not normal. SIMON: Eleanor Beardsley in Brussels, thanks so much. BEARDSLEY: You're welcome, Scott. SCOTT SIMON, HOST:  And we begin with more news about the investigation to Tuesday's terror attacks in Brussels. Authorities there continue to issue arrest warrants. At least seven people are currently being held in custody due to possible links to the Brussels or Paris attacks. Today, Belgian prosecutors charged another man in connection with the Tuesday bombings. And meanwhile, police raids are ongoing throughout the city. We go now to Eleanor Beardsley, who is in Brussels. Eleanor, thanks for being with us. ELEANOR BEARDSLEY, BYLINE: Good to be with you, Scott. SIMON: What do we know about this latest statement from Belgian officials that somebody else has been charged? BEARDSLEY: Right, they formally charged a man with terrorist murders. They've given a first name but not a last - Faycal C (ph). But the Belgian media is speculating that this is the mystery man, the missing man wearing the white coat and the hat at the Brussels airport. You remember the grainy camera footage of three men. SIMON: Yeah, surveillance video. BEARDSLEY: He's the one that left - yeah, surveillance video - he left his bomb and, you know, left the airport. And Belgian media is speculating that it's him, but it has not yet been confirmed by prosecutors. SIMON: And tell us about these raids that have been continuing all around Brussels. BEARDSLEY: Yeah, they went on all across the city starting Thursday night and all day yesterday. People are really on edge. And some of them took place in the Schaerbeek neighborhood in Brussels. Now, remember, that's where two - those two suicide brother bombers were living and the taxi driver picked up three men that morning and took them to the airport. And he became suspicious when they wouldn't let him help them with their bags because there were bombs in their bags. So he went to the police - the taxi driver did - and that's how they found their apartment and all the explosives. So I went there and. . . SIMON: Sounds like maybe we have lost our Eleanor Beardsley in Brussels. Sounds like the - perhaps the line has dropped. I think - did - let me check in our control room.

The former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karodzic was convicted of genocide and crimes against humanity at the war crimes tribunal in The Hague. The trial lasted eight years. In the end, Karodzic was found guilty for his role in the Bosnian War, including the slaughter of 8,000 Muslim men in the town of Srebrenica in 1995. But it took 13 years after that massacre to capture and bring Radovan Karodzic to even face charges. Julian Borger has written about this often bizarre chase in his book, \"The Butcher's Trail. \" Julian Borger joins us now from The Hague where he's been covering the trial for The Guardian. Thanks so much for being with us. JULIAN BORGER: A pleasure. SIMON: Many accomplished NATO Special Forces and military leaders, including, by the way, at a different state in his career, General David Petraeus, personally tried to put the cuffs on Karodzic. How did he evade them for so long? BORGER: From the very start after the Dayton peace treaty, there were 64,000 NATO-led troops in Bosnia. That was the time really to catch these war crime suspects, Radovan Karodzic in particular, but there wasn't political will. There was a feeling that if you went after Karodzic and people like that, that it would disrupt the peace. Then when it did become a political priority, particular for the Clinton administration who really wanted to get Karodzic before the end of Clinton's term in office - and they put huge resources into it - it was the biggest deployment of Special Forces anywhere before 9/11. But to some extent, they came too late. By then, he'd gone deep underground. SIMON: When Karodzic was arrested, he was, as we say, hiding in plain sight, wasn't he? BORGER: That's right. In the last few years where, as a fugitive, when he was living in Belgrade, he eked out this living as a new age guru. He grew a big bushy white beard, had glasses, had a top knot at the top of his head tied up with a black ribbon. He presented this rather remarkable monk-like figure and, as you say, hid in plain sight. He was often at seminars and conferences about alternative medicine. He went to his local bar and he didn't sit on the sidelines there. He took center stage and actually played a kind of Balkan fiddle called a gusle. And everyone stood around and clapped and applauded him. And he was sitting under a portrait of Radovan Karodzic, this man who was the hero for most of the people in the bar. And not one of them spotted the resemblance. He lived across the stairwell in his block of flats from a woman who worked with Interpol. And her - every time she went into work, she logged on to her computer and saw the world's most wanted, including Osama bin Laden and Radovan Karodzic. And the penny never dropped. It was like a long-running performance that only came to an end really when his brother made a vital slip. SIMON: He made a phone call, right? What happened? BORGER: He made a phone call. And he used a SIM card that he shouldn't have used. It was one that was on the files of the people chasing Karodzic. SIMON: To put you on the spot a bit, does a sentence like this that comes 21 years after the Srebrenica massacre serve as a deterrent to alleged war crimes being committed today, let's say in Syria and/or Iraq? BORGER: I think that the fact that they got all 161 names on the list of indicted war crime suspects did represent a very - a remarkable achievement when it came to pushing back in punitive war crimes. But I think that achievement and that legacy has since then unraveled because there is no more political will, no more political appetite for enforcing justice for war crimes. And so what we're seeing in Syria and Iraq is really the price of this abandonment of what was achieved by The Hague war crimes tribunal. SIMON: Julian Borger of The Guardian, thanks so much.

The country's been ripped apart by five years of civil war, allowing the self-declared Islamic State to flourish. Now President Obama says defeating ISIS is his top priority, but the fingerprint of ISIS on these recent attacks and the prospect of ones in the future has critics challenging the president to adopt a more aggressive Syria strategy, perhaps including U. S. troops. Kori Schake is a research fellow at Stanford University's Hoover Institution and she's held positions in the State Department and National Security Council under President George W. Bush. Ms. Schake, thanks very much for being with us. KORI SCHAKE: It's a pleasure. SIMON: Let's get to the high - hard one first. How many U. S. troops, and why don't countries in the region take that over? SCHAKE: So countries in the region don't take it over because - A, it's hard. B, they're not confident that we will give them the kind of help they will need to succeed. And I think actually after leaving Iraq and our halfhearted efforts in Afghanistan, we are actually going to need to put troops on the ground in order for other people to be willing to put troops on the ground. As to how many troops, it's not clear. It depends on what you want to do and how fast you want to do it. But remember, we put 50,000 troops into the Balkans when we were trying to end the war there, so we shouldn't be parsimonious about this. What you do with sending large numbers of troops is buy yourself a wider margin of error to succeed. And we ought not to be so hesitant and pretend we can solve this problem with small increments slowly escalating in the way the president is. The point of warfare is to change your enemy's calculus, and you do that by making large statements, not by making small, tentative ones. SIMON: I notice, for example, you refer to the halfhearted effort in Afghanistan. I just want to note as I - before I go to the next question, 'cause I think they're related - that certainly a lot of Americans don't have the impression that the effort in Afghanistan was halfhearted at all. On the contrary, I hear a lot of Americans who might be listening to this interview asking right now, haven't we already lost enough men and women in Iraq and Afghanistan? SCHAKE: Yes, we have taken casualties in Iraq and Afghanistan. But if you want to solve this problem, you actually need to put military force against it. And the messages that we are sending to ISIS and other adversaries are that we are hesitant to acknowledge the magnitude of the problem, that we are hesitant to commit the force necessary to succeed at it. And if we want to actually achieve the president's objective and destroy ISIS, we need to be a lot more committed to the outcome rather than setting arbitrary limits on our participation, whether pretending we're not in there with ground troops, limiting the number of ground troops or limiting the time that we have - will commit them to the fight. SIMON: And - but what about, as President Obama suggested in a recent interview, the idea that we can see U. S. force rarely works in the Middle East and that's why he didn't choose sides in Syria to begin with? SCHAKE: I think there are two things wrong with the president's approach. First, it underestimates the costs of not intervening, which are very high. And second, there are successful examples. There's the 1991 Gulf War. Perhaps more importantly for Syria, there's the example of intervention in the Kurdish areas of northern Iraq after the 1991 war where we declared a safe area, protected it for more than 10 years while Kurds in the area could grow successful leadership, and now they're the sectarian success story of Iraq. Another useful example for Syria is the Balkans in 1990s, where so much ethnic cleansing had gone on in that civil war that the sectarian communities were effectively in different cantonments. And Syria is almost to that sad place now, and intervention in Syria on the model of the Balkans would be to protect specific areas in the country and allow people to migrate to those areas.

Ivo Daalder is the president of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs and former U. S. ambassador to NATO. He joins us from Chicago. Mr. Ambassador, thanks for being with us. IVO DAALDER: Well, it's my pleasure. SIMON: Are a lot of Europeans rethinking whether or not they even want to be unified? DAALDER: Yes, I think they are. I think a good many Europeans are thinking maybe open borders is not such a great idea. Maybe the best thing we can do is to start closing our borders and make sure that there are no migrants, no refugees, no foreign influences that are affecting our security and well-being inside the country. SIMON: You've also suggested that there's a kind of a parallel with politics in the United States at the moment. DAALDER: Yeah, in some way I think you are seeing the same phenomenon in Europe as you are seeing with the support for Donald Trump and, to some extent, for Bernie Sanders who are attracting voters who are, in the Trump case, anti-immigrant, don't really want to be part of an activist foreign policy. They're anti-trade and they're nativists. Those same streaks are in Europe. We're seeing people who are rebelling against the European Union, the open market, the open borders, who are rebelling against migration and refugees and who have lost out or feel that they have lost out on globalization and trade and are now opposing trade. So the same phenomenon we see here in the United States you also see in Europe. And in that sense, we are having a crisis that really affects Western liberal democracies writ large. SIMON: I wonder what you'd say, Mr. Ambassador, to a citizen of Belgium or France who might say now a united Europe is just too bureaucratic and too centralized to protect its population. DAALDER: Well, I think that is a sentiment you are hearing increasingly in places like Belgium and France that - the problem is that the threat is not just from without but it is also from within. Belgian citizens, people born in Belgium, blew up the metro station and airport, where French citizens born in France who blew up the concert hall and stadium in - last November. That threat needs to be dealt with not only by the countries themselves but can more effectively be dealt with by the Europeans coming together, sharing intelligence, which is not what they're doing right now, protecting their external borders much better than they have been able to do, rather than each individually trying to deal with this challenge. SIMON: You've cautioned that closing borders in Europe you believe will damage the continent but also the United States. And I wonder what you'd say to those Americans who might ask why. What does that have to do with me? DAALDER: Well, we fought three wars in the 20th century in Europe - we had World War I, we had World War II and we had the Cold War - because we believed that a stable united Europe was our best partner to deal with the challenges in the world. If that was true in the 20th century, it's even more true in the 21st century when it is the only partners we can find militarily, economically and politically around the world that we can count on. They're not doing enough, but they're doing more than anybody else. If your board were to go under, were to collapse, where nationalism would ignite the kinds of dangers we saw in the 1920s, in the 1930s, we, the United States, would suffer in the same way that we did in the 1920s and 1930s.

Stefan Jagsch, who is a local leader of Germany's far-right NPD party, is reported to be recovering after a car crash near Budingen. The NPD won a little over 10 percent of the vote in that municipality in state elections this month. The party's campaigned against opening Germany to the more than a million people who've sought asylum in the country, mostly from Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan. Stefan Jagsch took part in a neo-Nazi march in January where immigrants were assailed as benefit-scrounging tourists, invaders and lawless primates. Chancellor Angela Merkel has called the NPD anti-democratic, xenophobic, anti-Semitic and anti-constitutional. Earlier this month, Stefan Jagsch was driving when he lost control of his car and crashed into a tree. The local fire brigade says that passengers in a mini-bus driving along the road saw his crumpled automobile and stopped. Two people got out of the bus and pulled Stefan Jagsch from the wreckage of his car. They began to give him emergency first aid. An ambulance arrived and the two men assured emergency workers that the man they had rescued from a smoldering wreck had been wearing his seat belt in the car. The ambulance then took Stefan Jagsch to the hospital. Who are the strangers who stopped to help a man they didn't know? According to press reports, the people in the van were Syrian refugees. They left before police could arrive, perhaps because they didn't want to tell authorities who they were or how they'd gotten into Germany. This is a nice, even inspiring, story, but it doesn't have a storybook ending. The head of the local NPD called the rescue of his party's candidate apparently a very good humane act. But he didn't indicate that their humane act had changed his party's view of refugees as lawless primates. Stefan Jagsch insisted this week on his Facebook page that he was unconscious when he was saved. He gave thanks to, quote, \"all the people who were on the spot to help me. \" But he didn't mention who they were, much less suggest that their kindness caused him to question his feelings about refugees. His post appears to have been taken down. It is hard for politicians to ever change the views that get them a following. But perhaps a few more citizens may hear the story and see people they had dismissed with a few hateful phrases as people who would help them, too.

And it's one thing when the crisis is personal, when it's about one person, but what about when a crisis is global, when it affects millions of people? MELISSA FLEMING: If you tell the story of 60 million people, everybody's just going to shut off. RAZ: This is Melissa Fleming. She's with the U. N. High Commissioner for Refugees. FLEMING: I'm the head of communications, and my job is to, you know, get people to pay attention, build bridges of empathy to people. But frankly, it's very difficult. RAZ: Difficult to wrap your head around the idea that we're in the middle of the worst refugee crisis since World War II. FLEMING: We're in the midst of a mega-crisis. Over 60 million people have been forced from their home due to conflict. RAZ: 60 million people displaced from their homes in the Middle East and elsewhere. And because it's hard to picture that many people, Melissa Fleming told the story of just one person. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)FLEMING: There's one story that keeps me awake at night. And it's about Doaa, a Syrian refugee, 19-years-old. She was living a grinding existence in Egypt working day wages. Her dad was constantly thinking of his thriving business back in Syria that had been blown to pieces by a bomb. And the war that drove them there was still raging in its fourth year. And the community that once welcomed them there had become weary of them. And one day, men on motorcycles tried to kidnap her. Once an aspiring student thinking only of her future, now she was scared all the time. RAZ: As the story goes on, Doaa's fiance, Bassem, convinces her they have to start a new life in Europe. So Bassem hands his life savings over to smugglers. In September 2014, Bassem and Doaa and hundreds of other refugees get onto a rickety fishing boat bound for Italy, and they're on the Mediterranean Sea for four days. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)FLEMING: Day four, the passengers were getting agitated. They asked the captain, when will we get there? He told them to shut up. He said in 16 hours, we will reach the shores of Italy. They were weak and weary. And soon, they saw a boat approach, a smaller boat. Ten men on board started shouting at them, hurling insults, asking them to all disembark and get on this smaller, more unseaworthy boat. The parents were terrified for their children, and they collectively refused to disembark. So the boat sped away in anger, and a half an hour later came back and starting deliberately ramming a hole in the side of Doaa's boat. And she heard how they yelled, let the fish eat your flesh. And they started laughing as the boat capsized and sank. The 300 people below deck were doomed. Doaa was holding onto the side of the boat, and she can't swim. But she started moving her arms and her legs thinking this is swimming. And miraculously, Bassem found a life ring. It was one of those child's rings used to play in swimming pools and on calm seas. And Doaa climbed onto the ring, her arms and her legs dangling by the side. Around 100 people survived initially, and they started coming together in groups praying for rescue. But when a day went by and no one came, some people gave up hope. And Doaa and Bassem watched as men in the distance took their life vests off and sank into the water. It was their second day, and Bassem was getting very weak. And he said to her, I'm sorry, my love, that I put you in this situation. I have never loved anyone as much as I love you. And he released himself into the water. And Doaa watched as the love of her life drowned before her eyes. Later that day, a mother came up to Doaa with her small, 18-month-old daughter, Masa, and she said to Doaa please take this child. Let her be part of you. I will not survive. And then she went away and drowned. RAZ: Now, incredibly after four days on a plastic life ring in the middle of the Mediterranean, Doaa was rescued. Both she and the baby, Masa survived. And Doaa was eventually resettled in Sweden. FLEMING: It's an unbelievable survival story. Every time I hear a refugee story, I think, how could you have survived that? How could she have survived four days on the water and still managed to save a baby? It's amazing story of strength, resilience and also hope and love. RAZ: You know, it's strange 'cause we talk about this thing as a crisis. Like, we talk about the refugee crisis, and it's very distant for most people in the world, right? FLEMING: Yeah. RAZ: I mean, it's - there are many different types of people who are involved with that crisis. There are people like you who are trying to help manage it and help get the word out. And then there are people who are experiencing it, who are in that crisis, who are in the midst of it. FLEMING: Yeah. I mean, I think they finally - they've risked their lives to escape Syria. And when they finally reach their destination, all of a sudden they realize I can't relax. I'm in a foreign country, a country that I wasn't planning really for. I don't know the language. My kids don't know the language. And so they have a new crisis themselves. It's a personal crisis. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)FLEMING: There is something more that we can do than just simply helping refugees survive. We can help them thrive. We should think of refugee camps and communities as more than just temporary population centers where people languish, waiting for the war to end, rather as centers of excellence where refugees can triumph over their trauma and train for the day that they can go home. Not investing in refugees is a huge missed opportunity. I believe how we treat the uprooted will shape the future of our world. The victims of war can hold the keys to lasting peace, and it's the refugees who can stop the cycle of violence. RAZ: I mean, this is - there are only a few equivalent crises in the world like climate change that affects everybody, you know, that has real ripple effects because for the most part, people experience a crisis and it's confined to their family or their friends or their job or their own community. And this is something that ripples throughout the world. I mean, even though we may not be touched by it personally, we are affected by it. FLEMING: I think so. I think now what's happening is a backlash in Europe. And we see the result refugees being equated with terrorism, refugees being called economic migrants, they are to steal jobs. But it's - the more people understand or the more refugees they meet and the more they know the news story, the more they fear, actually this could happen to me. And this is the only way I think we can build the understanding. We get to know the individuals, get to know their stories, and really understand that they're not here - they didn't come to our countries because they chose to. They came to our countries because they had to. RAZ: Melissa Fleming. She's the head of communications for the U. N. High Commissioner for Refugees. You can see both of her Ted Talks at TED. com.

President Obama started hosting these summits to achieve one of his signature goals - preventing nuclear stockpiles from falling into the hands of terrorists. NPR's Scott Horsley reports. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: This week, President Obama called nuclear terrorism a perfect example of a 21st-century security challenge, the kind no one nation can solve on its own. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BARACK OBAMA: I convened our first summit six years ago in this same room because the danger of a terrorist group obtaining and using a nuclear weapon is one of the greatest threats to global security. HORSLEY: Six years later, Harvard's Matthew Bunn says leaders have made substantial progress. They've tried to beef up security around nuclear installations, and more than a dozen countries, including Ukraine, got rid of their highly-enriched uranium and plutonium. MATTHEW BUNN: Aren't we all glad that the potential bomb material wasn't in Ukraine anymore when the fighting started? HORSLEY: At the same time, Bunn says, there are still a lot of vulnerable stockpiles left. Obama says terrorist groups, like the self-proclaimed Islamic State, are always on the lookout for new tools to wreak havoc. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)OBAMA: There is no doubt that if these madmen ever got their hands on a nuclear bomb or nuclear material, they most certainly would use it to kill as many innocent people as possible. HORSLEY: In the run-up to this week's summit, a number of countries signed onto a treaty requiring them to handle nuclear material in a secure way. But Kelsey Davenport of the Arms Control Association says because that treaty focuses on civilian material, it doesn't go far enough. KELSEY DAVENPORT: That's an area where the summit process could have done more. There are huge stockpiles, particularly in the United States and Russia, of weapons usable nuclear material that are dedicated for military purposes. HORSLEY: Obama says the U. S. Navy is exploring new ways to power its nuclear fleet that wouldn't require as much highly-enriched uranium. But Tom Collina of the antinuclear Ploughshares Fund complains the Pentagon is still too invested in building nuclear weapons. TOM COLLINA: As we're controlling and securing nuclear material around the world, the world is still producing nuclear material. And in fact, it's producing it faster than we can control it. HORSLEY: Collina and others say Obama deserves credit for curtailing Iran's nuclear program and for sounding the alarm about nuclear terrorism. Now that the president has wrapped up his last security summit, Harvard's Bunn says there's a big question mark about what happens next. BUNN: I think a lot will depend on who the next president is and whether they are as committed to getting this material locked down. HORSLEY: The security summit is part of Obama's larger ambition of a world free of nuclear weapons. He repeated that goal may not be achieved in his lifetime, but, he added, we've begun.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) OBAMA: There is no doubt that if these madmen ever got their hands on a nuclear bomb or nuclear material, they most certainly would use it to kill as many innocent people as possible. HORSLEY: In the run-up to this week's summit, a number of countries signed onto a treaty requiring them to handle nuclear material in a secure way. But Kelsey Davenport of the Arms Control Association says because that treaty focuses on civilian material, it doesn't go far enough. KELSEY DAVENPORT: That's an area where the summit process could have done more. There are huge stockpiles, particularly in the United States and Russia, of weapons usable nuclear material that are dedicated for military purposes. HORSLEY: Obama says the U. S. Navy is exploring new ways to power its nuclear fleet that wouldn't require as much highly-enriched uranium. But Tom Collina of the antinuclear Ploughshares Fund complains the Pentagon is still too invested in building nuclear weapons. TOM COLLINA: As we're controlling and securing nuclear material around the world, the world is still producing nuclear material. And in fact, it's producing it faster than we can control it. HORSLEY: Collina and others say Obama deserves credit for curtailing Iran's nuclear program and for sounding the alarm about nuclear terrorism. Now that the president has wrapped up his last security summit, Harvard's Bunn says there's a big question mark about what happens next. BUNN: I think a lot will depend on who the next president is and whether they are as committed to getting this material locked down. HORSLEY: The security summit is part of Obama's larger ambition of a world free of nuclear weapons. He repeated that goal may not be achieved in his lifetime, but, he added, we've begun.

The city was recaptured by the Syrian government, but it has been ravaged. There is a historical toll, as well as one in human lives. A triumphal stone arch from the second century is among the ancient artifacts that were destroyed by ISIS. And now a robot in Italy is beginning the work of the reconstruction of some of those sites. Roger Michel heads the Institute for Digital Archaeology. They're behind the efforts to model and maybe eventually rebuild some of those sites. Mr. Michel joins us from Boston. Thanks so much for being with us. ROGER MICHEL: Hello, Scott. Thanks for having me on the show. SIMON: Can we understand the scale of destruction in Syria and Iraq and Libya, for that matter, where I know you've been active? MICHEL: It's possible to calculate in terms of cubic meters of stone. It's not possible, I don't think, to calculate the human toll, both the toll on the people who have lost their lives tragically but also the toll on people whose livelihoods depended on the sites, whose national identity and local identity was attached to those ancient sites. That's the part that's impossible to calculate. SIMON: Yeah. So what do your digital blueprints do? MICHEL: We have been collecting, over the last two years, a vast digital archive of both 3-D and 2-D images of sites throughout the Middle East in conflict zones, sites that we have identified as being at risk. This photographic archive provides a resource for scholars, it provides a virtual resource for anyone who wants to visit these sites remotely. But it also provides the opportunity, and one that we're exploiting now, of recreating some of these structures in 3-D form, that is through the use of 3-D printing and carving technology. SIMON: And what are you doing specifically with this arch? MICHEL: So the arch was selected by the director general of Antiquities and Museums himself as the first object for recreation. And we are in the process now of recreating it, for all appearances, be identical to the arch in terms of its physical appearance at the time of its destruction. SIMON: And will it be in the same place or just adjacent to the ruins? MICHEL: So the plan now is for the arch to be displayed in three cities - in London and in New York and in Dubai. Then we've been invited by Syria to place the arch near the site in Palmyra where the original one stood. Now, needless to say, we'll need to ensure that we have all necessary permissions from our government and from the Syrian government before that happens. But that is the plan at the moment. SIMON: As I don't have to tell you, Mr. Michel, digital reconstruction is getting so good it's created a controversy. And we've done stories in Bosnia and in Afghanistan where there are people who are concerned that these reconstructions, in their own way, try to expunge history. MICHEL: The response that I'd make to that is a couple of things. Part of it is a culture clash. In the West, we are very fetishistic about originality. We want to touch the object that the master touched. This goes back to the days of reliquaries when people had bits and pieces of saints that they carried around with them. The old saw in the East, as it's my grandfather's knife, I replace the handle. My father replaced the blade. It's my grandfather's knife. For people in other parts of the world, the role of objects is not to somehow through the object itself bring you close to history. It is a visual cue that provides memories of history. The history and heritage resides in the mind. And that's what these reconstructions can certainly provide and have provided for hundreds and hundreds of years. Indeed, most of the sites in Sicily today are 19th century reconstructions. SIMON: I never knew that. I mean, I've been to Syracuse and all over Sicily and I was seeing reconstructions? MICHEL: Absolutely. If you were in Syracuse, you certainly did. Naxos is a very good original site, but many of the other sites are significantly reconstructed.

But Russia has solidified its presence in Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula two years after its invasion. Other nations in the region worry about the role of Russia in the future. Hannes Hanso is the defense minister of Estonia. He joins us now in our studios. Thanks so much for being with us. HANNES HANSO: Thank you. SIMON: Do you worry that what happened to Crimea could happen to Estonia? HANSO: Well, I think we need to look a little bit further back into history when we talk about Crimea. Actually, Russia invaded two parts of a sovereign country, Georgia, in 2008. And I think Russia was encouraged by the lack of, sort of, principled approach by international community to that issue. And they was encouraged by try again in 2014 by invading Crimea on top of it. Of course, it has also invaded or aided the, you know, illegal occupation of Luhansk and Donetsk region. Am I worried? Of course I'm worried. SIMON: Yeah. President Obama notably said in a recent issue of The Atlantic - I'm going to read the quote - \"The fact is that Ukraine, which is a non-NATO country, is going to be vulnerable to military domination by Russian no matter what we do. \"So does that make Estonians feel more or less secure - or confident that the U. S. would rally to their side? HANSO: Well, I'm very confident of our allied relationship with not only U. S. , but NATO as a whole. It's quite clear that the strength of the alliance is in its unity. But also, when we return to the topic of Ukraine in that context, I think it's important to understand that we have learned a bit from the Georgia experience. There are ongoing sanctions against Russia, and we have taken a very strong approach. And maintaining that the unity, I think, is a key. And Russia will exploit any differences that allies would have to its own benefit. So we, of course, in NATO's eastern region understand what is at stake here. And I think we shouldn't just return to the business as usual unless Russia changes its ways. It knows what it has to do. SIMON: United States is working with Russia to try and concoct some kind of agreement that might end the Syrian civil war. Let me ask you this bluntly. Do you think Russia can be trusted as a partner in the international community? HANSO: Well (laughter), Russia is now a player in the Middle East and in Syria. And Russia has sort of bombed its way onto the discussion table, clearly. And I don't think Russia's really doing any favors by handing this sort of oxygen mask to a dying regime of Assad. It's not going to resolve the problem. It's a proxy war. And in Russia is now one of the main actors there. And can they be trusted? Well, I'm an Estonian. We have lived with Russia over the very long period of time during the occupation also. So clearly, that lasted for decades. Can it be trusted? Well, I couldn't say yes right now. SIMON: Do you have any concern that in between the threat from ISIS, the terrorist attacks in Western Europe and, for that matter, an American administration that has openly called for the pivot to Asia, that that will divert attention from your neighborhood in Europe? HANSO: Yes. This is a challenge when you talk about tensions in our region because of Russia and the Middle East. Clearly, we don't want it to be a competition. NATO is the largest military organization in the world. It can face these challenges. I'm convinced about that. And also, one thing that I'd like to stress - Estonia has been a very solid ally with the U. S. I mean, we have been involved in Iraq. We have been in Afghanistan, in the Balkans, in some places in Africa. So we don't see security as sort of a one-way street. It's a two-way street. SIMON: What do you say to Americans who say - look, I wish Estonia, wherever it is, all the best, but I don't think its fate is anything that really relates to me? HANSO: I mean, it is a fairly fundamental thing. I mean, what would you like the world to be like? I mean, I want freedoms. I want democracy. I want the, sort of, basic things - human rights and all this sort of things. And I believe that your country does the same.

That's where we try to understand stories we'll be hearing more about parsing some of the words associated with those stories. And today, we're going to think more about this phrase - safe third country. Those three words are key to understanding the controversy behind a deal struck by the European Union and Turkey. The deal is designed to slow the influx of migrants to Western Europe from Syria, Iraq, Northeast Africa, Afghanistan. And it allows the EU to ship refugees to Turkey as a safe third country starting tomorrow. NPR's Peter Kenyon joins us now from Izmir, Turkey, to break down that phrase for us. Hey Peter. PETER KENYON, BYLINE: Hi Mary Louise. KELLY: So in this context, what do we mean by safe third country? KENYON: Well, safe third country - it's a term of international law. And it basically means if a country's not going to keep an asylum-seeker there while a claim is being processed - if they're going to send them somewhere else, it has to be somewhere their lives won't be threatened because of their race or religion, where they won't face torture. There's a list of criteria they have to meet. KELLY: How safe is Turkey going to be for these people coming back? There are a lot of questions being raised, for example, about what legal protections people will enjoy or not there. KENYON: Actually, they do have protection. It just happens to be temporary. And none of these people coming back will be allowed to apply for asylum inside Turkey itself. Only Europeans are allowed to do that under Turkey's very unusual asylum laws. But the asylum-seekers do get this temporary protection while they're there waiting for another country to process their claim, and that's something that can take years. KELLY: What about just the specifics of where they will go? Where will they be living? KENYON: Well, that's really not clear. There have been camps. They've been full of something close to 300,000. Many more have been living just in apartments. And that brings us to another odd phrase; it's called non-refoulement. And that means no pushing back. In other words, you can't send asylum-seekers back into their conflict zone they fled from. Human Rights Watch recently accused Turkey of doing exactly - forcibly pushing Syrians back across the border. Turkey denies the charge. If it were confirmed, it would expose them to a claim of not being a safe third country. KELLY: Just in terms of how this will unfold for refugees who are going to be sent to Turkey - yeah, I know you've been talking to some of the refugees there. How do they feel about this new policy that kicks in tomorrow? KENYON: Well, these are very sobering discussions, harrowing stories, as you can imagine of their trips. I met a Syrian woman who spent three hours in the Aegean when their boat capsized. She and her husband barely saved their three children. And she could only watch helplessly as her cousin's children died in the water. She says now if they can't make it in Turkey - it's hard to find work - she'd even think about going back to Syria. KELLY: She would think about going back to Syria. That's because of the desperation some of these people are feeling. KENYON: It's true. She says as bad as it is, at least I know the place. It's part of me. I'd rather be there. KELLY: Peter, we said this agreement officially kicks in tomorrow. What should we be watching for? KENYON: It may be very slow starting. But there may be some people coming back from Greece over the next three days certainly, and there's up to 5,000 who can come back in the first phase. And the agreement calls for as many as 72,000. And then all the questions you asked earlier kick in - where are they going to stay? Will they be able to have work? What's their future? KELLY: That's NPR's Peter Kenyon, speaking to us from Izmir, Turkey, about the phrase safe third country. Peter, thanks a lot. KENYON: Thanks Mary Louise.

And today, we're going to think more about this phrase - safe third country. Those three words are key to understanding the controversy behind a deal struck by the European Union and Turkey. The deal is designed to slow the influx of migrants to Western Europe from Syria, Iraq, Northeast Africa, Afghanistan. And it allows the EU to ship refugees to Turkey as a safe third country starting tomorrow. NPR's Peter Kenyon joins us now from Izmir, Turkey, to break down that phrase for us. Hey Peter. PETER KENYON, BYLINE: Hi Mary Louise. KELLY: So in this context, what do we mean by safe third country? KENYON: Well, safe third country - it's a term of international law. And it basically means if a country's not going to keep an asylum-seeker there while a claim is being processed - if they're going to send them somewhere else, it has to be somewhere their lives won't be threatened because of their race or religion, where they won't face torture. There's a list of criteria they have to meet. KELLY: How safe is Turkey going to be for these people coming back? There are a lot of questions being raised, for example, about what legal protections people will enjoy or not there. KENYON: Actually, they do have protection. It just happens to be temporary. And none of these people coming back will be allowed to apply for asylum inside Turkey itself. Only Europeans are allowed to do that under Turkey's very unusual asylum laws. But the asylum-seekers do get this temporary protection while they're there waiting for another country to process their claim, and that's something that can take years. KELLY: What about just the specifics of where they will go? Where will they be living? KENYON: Well, that's really not clear. There have been camps. They've been full of something close to 300,000. Many more have been living just in apartments. And that brings us to another odd phrase; it's called non-refoulement. And that means no pushing back. In other words, you can't send asylum-seekers back into their conflict zone they fled from. Human Rights Watch recently accused Turkey of doing exactly - forcibly pushing Syrians back across the border. Turkey denies the charge. If it were confirmed, it would expose them to a claim of not being a safe third country. KELLY: Just in terms of how this will unfold for refugees who are going to be sent to Turkey - yeah, I know you've been talking to some of the refugees there. How do they feel about this new policy that kicks in tomorrow? KENYON: Well, these are very sobering discussions, harrowing stories, as you can imagine of their trips. I met a Syrian woman who spent three hours in the Aegean when their boat capsized. She and her husband barely saved their three children. And she could only watch helplessly as her cousin's children died in the water. She says now if they can't make it in Turkey - it's hard to find work - she'd even think about going back to Syria. KELLY: She would think about going back to Syria. That's because of the desperation some of these people are feeling. KENYON: It's true. She says as bad as it is, at least I know the place. It's part of me. I'd rather be there. KELLY: Peter, we said this agreement officially kicks in tomorrow. What should we be watching for? KENYON: It may be very slow starting. But there may be some people coming back from Greece over the next three days certainly, and there's up to 5,000 who can come back in the first phase. And the agreement calls for as many as 72,000. And then all the questions you asked earlier kick in - where are they going to stay? Will they be able to have work? What's their future? KELLY: That's NPR's Peter Kenyon, speaking to us from Izmir, Turkey, about the phrase safe third country. Peter, thanks a lot. KENYON: Thanks Mary Louise.", "section": "World", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Mossack Fonseca is based in Panama. But its clients move in international art circles, in Africa's diamond trade, on yachts sailing the Mediterranean and along the corridors of the Kremlin. A massive leak - more than 11 million records from the law firm's files is shedding light on how dark money flows through the global financial system. The records also are shedding light on offshore holdings of a dozen former and current world leaders. Jake Bernstein is a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter with International Consortium of Investigative Journalists. The group has spearheaded a year-long investigation at dozens of news organizations into these leaked documents. And Jake Bernstein, first off - I've got to ask - how did you get the documents? JAKE BERNSTEIN: This came through a German newspaper called Suddeutsche Zeitung. And they're the ones who obtained this extraordinary leak. It's more than 11 million documents that allows us a view into a secret world of hidden money that we've never seen before. KELLY: OK. Tell us some of the highlights of what you found. What was the most surprising thing? BERNSTEIN: Well, we found the financial holdings of 12 current and former world leaders, 128 public officials, 33 companies and people sanctioned by the United States because of evidence that they've done business with Mexican drug lords or terrorist organizations or rogue nations like North Korea or Iran. We found a network that's connected to Vladimir Putin, the President of Russia, that seems to have moved around $2 billion through a network of banks and secret offshore companies. KELLY: We should note there's nothing illegal about having an offshore company, about using offshore accounts. Take, say, with the Putin example for a moment, what is the takeaway here for what you found with these Russian accounts? BERNSTEIN: You know, there's a whole group of people around President Putin who have become incredibly wealthy during his tenure. And the U. S. Treasury Department has called it a corrupt regime. And they've sanctioned a number of these people. But they've never really provided evidence about their activities. And for the first time, we get to see some of that evidence. KELLY: OK, circle back to the law firm at the center of this web, Mossack Fonseca. I said that it's based in Panama. What else do we know about oy? BERNSTEIN: It's one of the top-five incorporators of offshore companies in the world. These are the companies that can be used to hide ownership of assets. And most people wouldn't know about it because generally when they are big scandals, they don't really focus on the middlemen. But, for example, right now there's a big scandal in Brazil that has touched the president, the former president. It could be one of the biggest corruption scandals in Latin American history. And Mossack Fonseca is right in the middle of it. And Brazilian prosecutors have called it a money laundering machine. KELLY: What does Mossack Fonseca say when you have put these questions to them about the revelations coming up through records leaked from their firm? BERNSTEIN: Well, they say they just create the companies. The analogy they like to use is that they're a car factory, and they aren't responsible once the car leaves the factory. But what's clear from the records is that their involvement continues during the life of the company. I mean, they create sham directors and officers of these companies who then have to sign official documents like bank account openings. And we also know that Mossack Fonseca has legal responsibilities to know their customers and their activities. And it seems clear that they're not really living up to those responsibilities. KELLY: Just to be absolutely clear, Jake Bernstein, because it's easy to make something sound shady. In fact, all kinds of tax attorneys advise their clients regularly to do the absolutely legal thing of put money in various offshore accounts to avoid paying taxes. What did you actually find in terms of evidence of laws being broken? BERNSTEIN: You're absolute right. And I would guess that many, if not even most of the clients at Mossack Fonseca are law-abiding. What we see though is a huge number of convicted criminals where there's supposed to be more due diligence, where it's clear that people have already committed crimes and they have used these offshore companies either to commit them or to hide the proceeds. KELLY: Jake Bernstein of the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists. Their new report examines the offshore accounts and tax havens used by everyone from criminals to heads of state. Thanks so much for speaking with us. BERNSTEIN: No, thank you for having me. MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:   Let's turn now to the most interesting law firm you've never heard of.

It's a brutal mob funded largely by drug trafficking. And it's been tied to corrupt local officials. For the past four years, Judge Roberto Di Bella has taken a new kind of approach to try to deplete the ranks of the group. Judge Di Bella presides over juvenile court, and he's trying to prevent the children of 'Ndrangheta members from joining the family business. Judge Di Bella joins us now via Skype from Reggio Calabria. Welcome to the program, judge. ROBERTO DI BELLA: (Speaking Italian). JANE CHILA: Hello. MARTIN: And we will be assisted today by translator Jane Chila, also in Reggio. Thanks so much for your help, Jane. CHILA: OK. All right, not at all. MARTIN: Judge Di Bella, can you explain how the program works? Are the children who appear before your court - they have somehow gotten involved in these crimes. They're being used already at a young age? DI BELLA: (Speaking Italian). CHILA: Yes. And very often it happens at 12 or 13 years of age. MARTIN: And what kind of crimes are we talking about? DI BELLA: (Speaking Italian). CHILA: Homicides and mainly drug problems. MARTIN: The young children - you said ages, sometimes, 12 years old - are implicated in homicides? DI BELLA: (Speaking Italian). CHILA: Yes. Not exactly 12, but that's the starting from 14, 15 years old. MARTIN: And it's my understanding, judge, that in certain circumstances, you have actually removed these young people from their homes and placed them with other families or in youth facilities. How do you do that? Don't you get resistance from their families? DI BELLA: (Speaking Italian). CHILA: In many cases, the minors are sent to communities or families - volunteer families. And the mothers understand that their children are better off for them. And when they understand - the mothers - they accept that these decisions are the judge's. And many times, the mothers - they actually beg the judges to help their children, to take them away. MARTIN: So you're describing the mothers of these young people who are desperate to help their child find another path so they don't get embroiled in this violent family business. And what you're describing - taking these young people out of the dangerous family situation and putting them with other families, I guess it's something akin to an American foster system. But can you describe what kind of situations these young people are walking into? I mean, who are the families who are opening their doors to, in some cases, convicted criminals? DI BELLA: (Speaking Italian). CHILA: They usually contact families - volunteer families that have already been prepared with the anti-mafia people. And so they know exactly how to handle the situation. MARTIN: How long do they stay away from home, these young people - indefinitely, forever? Or is it sometimes a temporary period of time? DI BELLA: (Speaking Italian). CHILA: Usually, it's temporary. Anyway, they leave families when the minors reach their 18th year. MARTIN: Do you have any idea what these young adults do when they leave those volunteer family situations? I mean, when they turn 18 and they're released, do they go back into the criminal syndicates? DI BELLA: (Speaking Italian). CHILA: Up to now, there have been no cases of these children going back to the criminal life. And in many cases, they also help them find a job. And the mothers also want to go where their children are located because, of course, they go to different places. MARTIN: You're obviously trying to help these children. But inevitably, your efforts, I imagine, are diminishing the power of this mafia organization, the 'Ndrangheta. So has this been risky for you? I mean, how has the organization responded to what you're doing - literally taking their children out of their homes? Have they threatened you? Have you been threatened? DI BELLA: (Speaking Italian). CHILA: I cannot say exactly I've been menaced, but many of these fathers are now in prison. MARTIN: Judge Roberto Di Bella and translator Jane Chila. We spoke with them via Skype from Reggio Calabria, Italy. Thanks to both of you. DI BELLA: (Speaking Italian). CHILA: Thank you very much. Goodbye.

I'm Rachel Martin. And this is For The Record. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)MARTIN: The investigation into the Brussels terrorist attacks is ongoing. And most of the attention is on one neighborhood called Molenbeek. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: It's a working-class neighborhood in Brussels that is now feared to be turning into a breeding ground of sorts for terrorists. MARTIN: Many of the terrorists responsible for both the attacks in Brussels and in Paris last November lived in Molenbeek. There's not an analogous city or neighborhood in the U. S. The closest you get is Minneapolis, home to the largest Somali community in the country. One in 4 of the more than 250 Americans who have tried to go join ISIS are from Minnesota. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)SCOTT PELLEY: Today, six Somali-Americans who live in Minnesota were charged with attempting to enlist with the terrorist group known as Islamic State. MARTIN: Now the federal government is stepping in to stop this trend. The Department of Justice is giving money to community groups in Minneapolis, trying to create alternative paths for young people who might be vulnerable to the ISIS message. For The Record this week, how one community is taking on the Islamic State. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)MARTIN: We're going to introduce you to two people who have dedicated much of their lives to fixing this problem. MOHAMUD NOOR: My name is Mohamud Noor. I'm the executive director of the Confederation of Somali Community in Minnesota. MOHAMED MOHAMUD: My name is Mohamed Mohamud. I'm the executive director of Somali American Parent Association. MARTIN: Before we get to the current situation, it's important to know the back story here. Mohamud Noor explains. NOOR: The youth who recruited didn't start with ISIS. It started with al-Shabaab way back, almost nine years ago. MARTIN: Al-Shabaab is the radical Islamist group that's been embroiled in the long civil war in Somalia. In 2006 and 2007, more than 20 people from Minnesota left to fight with al-Shabaab in Somalia. NOOR: And I think that was the wake-up call on that issue. And I think that is the same propaganda or message that is being used, the ideology of fighting for someone else's fight. MARTIN: So there was a history of radicalization here, but it's been compounded by other factors. The governor of Minnesota, Mark Dayton, said recently that the income of an average Somali family in the state is more than 70 percent lower than the average white family's. Mohamed Mohamud says that's connected to the threat of radicalism. MOHAMUD: When the young kid doesn't have any work and living in that poverty, and you get some evil people who are recruiting through their social media - they say, we have for you money, wife and power - a young kid who doesn't have enough, you know, mind to think, when he hears that he goes. MARTIN: A lot of these kids feel disconnected from their families, their peers, which is pretty normal, frankly, for teenagers anywhere. But Mohamed Mohamud says that kind of isolation is amplified in immigrant families. MOHAMUD: Some time a father came to me and he said, I am a Somali and I have an American kid in my home. Yes, I am an American citizen, but what I mean is that we don't understand each other. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)MOHAMUD: The families who came to me, they say, for example, my kid doesn't talk to me. He is or she is or he is, whatever - close his or her door, you know, immediately when they come to the house. I don't know what they do. The kids, they - I don't say that they are assimilated fully, but they are in - somewhere in the middle. They doesn't have their original culture. They didn't get to the assimilation fully, so they are - so middle. MARTIN: The Obama administration has put a lot of time and energy into thinking about what they call countering violent extremism. And one of the big conclusions is that the federal government needs to invest in local communities, so there's a new pilot program. The DOJ is giving money to community groups in Los Angeles, Boston and Minneapolis. In total, six groups in Minnesota that work with Somali youth will share about $300,000 in grants. Andrew Luger is the U. S. attorney for Minnesota. ANDREW LUGER: The whole community in my meetings really believed that with certain resources, and the right programming and partnerships with established nonprofits, that could lift up this community and help it fight terror recruiting. MARTIN: Mohamud Noor and Mohamed Mohamud both run organizations that got these federal grants. And they're tackling the issues from two perspectives - focusing on the kids, but also the parents. One challenge is technology. Parents often don't understand it, which is a problem because it can also be a place where kids are targeted by ISIS. Mohamed Mohamud works on teaching parents the basics. MOHAMUD: We are trying to teach them how they can go to their laptop and see which sites they have visited. MARTIN: It's worth pointing out how close-knit this community is. Mohamud Noor knows some of the families whose kids have left to try to fight with ISIS, and he has gotten those phone calls. I asked him what those conversations are like. Do they assume their child is gone forever, or do they think it's temporary and they'll come back? NOOR: Well, we haven't seen anybody leave and come back, so that's what they know. Once you leave, you're gone for good. I know some of the parents have tried to reach out when they had that line - communication line open. But what we know - it's a one-way ticket. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)MARTIN: Now this whole thing may sound overly simplistic. Even the name of the program - Building Community Resilience - sounds like thousands of other social programs around the country. And honestly, the aims are the same as many of these other organizations - job training, more after-school programs, things like that. But Andrew Luger says if there's even a chance that this program could deter one young person, it's a worthy investment. LUGER: From my perspective, we had to try something that would at least help the community. If it helps lessen terror recruiting, obviously that was the goal, but if it didn't, it was still good for an important and vital part of the overall Twin Cities community. MARTIN: Community groups in Minneapolis, LA and Boston are at different stages of putting their grant money to work, although it is impossible to determine if this program is actually going to end up preventing someone from going off to fight with ISIS. Even so, supporters say if it ends up making a positive difference, then these kinds of investments could be a model other cities could follow.

MARTIN: A lot of these kids feel disconnected from their families, their peers, which is pretty normal, frankly, for teenagers anywhere. But Mohamed Mohamud says that kind of isolation is amplified in immigrant families. MOHAMUD: Some time a father came to me and he said, I am a Somali and I have an American kid in my home. Yes, I am an American citizen, but what I mean is that we don't understand each other. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MOHAMUD: The families who came to me, they say, for example, my kid doesn't talk to me. He is or she is or he is, whatever - close his or her door, you know, immediately when they come to the house. I don't know what they do. The kids, they - I don't say that they are assimilated fully, but they are in - somewhere in the middle. They doesn't have their original culture. They didn't get to the assimilation fully, so they are - so middle. MARTIN: The Obama administration has put a lot of time and energy into thinking about what they call countering violent extremism. And one of the big conclusions is that the federal government needs to invest in local communities, so there's a new pilot program. The DOJ is giving money to community groups in Los Angeles, Boston and Minneapolis. In total, six groups in Minnesota that work with Somali youth will share about $300,000 in grants. Andrew Luger is the U. S. attorney for Minnesota. ANDREW LUGER: The whole community in my meetings really believed that with certain resources, and the right programming and partnerships with established nonprofits, that could lift up this community and help it fight terror recruiting. MARTIN: Mohamud Noor and Mohamed Mohamud both run organizations that got these federal grants. And they're tackling the issues from two perspectives - focusing on the kids, but also the parents. One challenge is technology. Parents often don't understand it, which is a problem because it can also be a place where kids are targeted by ISIS. Mohamed Mohamud works on teaching parents the basics. MOHAMUD: We are trying to teach them how they can go to their laptop and see which sites they have visited. MARTIN: It's worth pointing out how close-knit this community is. Mohamud Noor knows some of the families whose kids have left to try to fight with ISIS, and he has gotten those phone calls. I asked him what those conversations are like. Do they assume their child is gone forever, or do they think it's temporary and they'll come back? NOOR: Well, we haven't seen anybody leave and come back, so that's what they know. Once you leave, you're gone for good. I know some of the parents have tried to reach out when they had that line - communication line open. But what we know - it's a one-way ticket. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MARTIN: Now this whole thing may sound overly simplistic. Even the name of the program - Building Community Resilience - sounds like thousands of other social programs around the country. And honestly, the aims are the same as many of these other organizations - job training, more after-school programs, things like that. But Andrew Luger says if there's even a chance that this program could deter one young person, it's a worthy investment. LUGER: From my perspective, we had to try something that would at least help the community. If it helps lessen terror recruiting, obviously that was the goal, but if it didn't, it was still good for an important and vital part of the overall Twin Cities community. MARTIN: Community groups in Minneapolis, LA and Boston are at different stages of putting their grant money to work, although it is impossible to determine if this program is actually going to end up preventing someone from going off to fight with ISIS. Even so, supporters say if it ends up making a positive difference, then these kinds of investments could be a model other cities could follow.", "section": "World", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.

NPR's Peter Kenyon is in the Turkish port city of Izmir on the Aegean Sea. Peter, you've been reporting this story for months now. And you were in Izmir last fall. So what are you seeing? How does the situation there compare between now and then? PETER KENYON, BYLINE: Well, it's a dramatic change, Rachel. Last fall, we saw Syrians, Iraqis, others just milling around in public, at the bus stations, getting tickets to the coast, buying life jackets for the kids, waiting for their smuggler's call to go on to Greece and Germany or another country. Now the crossings are way down. In those days, it was thousands a day. Now it's hundreds at most. The Turkish coast guard stopped nearly 200 just yesterday. So everything, as a result, is much more undercover. There's an atmosphere of fear and caution for those few still trying to make the crossings. They can't get on the bus anymore unless they have special permission. There's police checkpoints. And Turks who know smugglers are telling us that the word on the street now is, look, don't go. It's a bad time. MARTIN: So it sounds like these new rules are serving as some kind of deterrent, although you've been talking to Syrians and Afghans there who are still intent on going - on making this journey. Where are they saying? KENYON: Well, it's interesting. We're hearing a few still intent, but also some saying OK, maybe not. The first migrants, as you said, could be sent back to Turkey here under this new deal as early as tomorrow. And the prospects for those who might be sent back or who haven't made it yet are equally gloomy. One Afghan I met gave his name Massoud (ph) - didn't want to use his last name - he used to work for the U. S. military in Kabul. He says he's worried about retaliation. But he talked about a very difficult journey - Kabul to Pakistan to Iran to Turkey, getting pushed back every step of the way. They failed three times to cross the Aegean. And now he says that's it - no more for him. Here's how Massoud put it. MASSOUD: No, I don't want to try. I called somebody in Greece. They said situation is very bad. Stay in Turkey. I saw somebody that still was trying to go to Greece. I told them they are sending back them. They said they cannot send them back. KENYON: But for you, that's enough. MASSOUD: Yeah. For me, it's enough. I lost all my money. Now I'm zero. KENYON: The problem is here in Turkey, there's just no work to be had. And if thousands of more people are about to descend on the country, the prospects are going to get even worse. MARTIN: The new deal between Turkey and the EU, as we've said, is supposed to come into effect tomorrow. How's the government preparing, Peter? What are their concerns about how they're going to put this into place? KENYON: Well, they say they can do it just fine. But there's no sign that they're ready to accommodate thousands more people. Up in Dikili to the north where we were this weekend, there's just an empty field where reception centers should be. There are protests both in Dikili and over in Greece of the not-in-my-backyard variety. So pressure is growing. And once again, the migrants are caught in the middle.

The leak of the millions of documents comes at a time, though, when there's actually been progress reining in abuse, as NPR's John Ydstie reports. JOHN YDSTIE, BYLINE: The revelations in the Panama Papers have generated anger and disgust. Politicians and leaders in countries from Russia to Iceland to the oil-rich Gulf states are implicated. The irony is that while the shady world of shell corporations and offshore accounts is still massive, the global community has made significant strides toward reining it in. Pascal Saint-Amans of the OECD's Global Forum on Transparency says global commitments to reduce banking secrecy are changing the way former tax havens are doing business. PASCAL SAINT-AMANS: If we take Switzerland, if we take Luxembourg, if we take Bermuda, Cayman Islands, Jersey, Guernsey, Singapore, Hong Kong - they have all committed to major change. YDSTIE: Back in 2009, in the wake of the financial crisis, the G-20 nations with the support of the U. S. agreed to push for greater transparency to curb the tax evasion made possible by secret offshore bank accounts. Here's how. If a U. S. citizen sets up a bank account in Switzerland, for instance, the Swiss automatically provide information on that account to U. S. authorities and vice versa. Pascal Saint-Amans says most countries have signed on. SAINT-AMANS: Panama is almost the only financial center - significant financial center - which has refused. YDSTIE: It is true that most countries have committed to the new level of transparency, but not all have implemented those commitments. And there are outstanding issues that need to be dealt with, says Heather Lowe of an organization called Global Financial Integrity. HEATHER LOWE: What the OECD is working on is very narrow in that it's looking only at tax evasion. YDSTIE: Lowe says that focus doesn't deal with another big part of the problem - money laundering through shell corporations. And she says those shell companies can easily be set up in the United States. That's because currently, anyone can create a corporation in any state without identifying who really owns or benefits from it. LOWE: If I wanted to create a company in Iowa, I need to provide four things. YDSTIE: The name of the company, the number of shares, and a couple of other things - but not the name of the officers, directors or shareholders. LOWE: Iowa has no idea who owns and controls the companies that it has created. And that's frightening. YDSTIE: That's one reason the Panamanian law firm at the center of the scandal set up an office in Las Vegas. Nevada is an easy place to set up a shell company. Bipartisan legislation introduced in Congress would require states to collect information on the true owners of companies. And the Obama administration has proposed a regulation that would require that banks ask for the name of the real owners for accounts they set up. Heather Lowe says she's confident that ultimately, change will come. LOWE: You know, I started my job in 2009 here at Global Financial Integrity. And if you'd said to me in 2009 that we would be where we are today on these issues, I think I would have laughed. We have made a huge amount of progress in a very short amount of time.

You know, the rooted problem of this crisis is structural mendacity, institutionalized deception and lying.

SIMON: I'm interested in asking about Cardinal George Pell in Australia. He apparently testified via video link before the Australian Royal Commission that's looking into institutional responses to sexual child abuse. And I gather that he admitted under oath that he had heard talk about abuse but had not followed up on that. I gather he testified from Rome. Any response from the Vatican? BERRY: There's been no real response from the Vatican that would indicate that Cardinal Pell is going to suffer any consequence. He is one of the most powerful figures in Rome. He oversees the new economics secretariat. I'm not suggesting that because of that financial power he is immune from any sort of punishment. He is about to turn 75. And I guess one of the tests will be whether Francis decides to let him quietly retire rather than putting him through the embarrassment of being removed because of what he did in Australia. But we have no indication either way as yet. SIMON: The way you describe it, Mr. Berry, the Vatican will occasionally issue apologies and cooperate in various investigations perhaps, but they haven't yet felt the onus to remove bishops, archbishops, cardinals from exercising the powers of the church. BERRY: It happens occasionally. Two American bishops have been forced out, you might say, in recent months from the Twin Cities - Archbishop Nienstedt and Bishop Finn of Kansas City. Finn, in fact, was convicted of a misdemeanor. And Nienstedt was deeply immersed in a cover-up. His own canon lawyer blew the whistle on him. And yet it took quite a while for those two men to resign. Everyone who has covered this assumes that they were forced out. But in fact, publicly, it's a resignation. There is no legal mechanism with any teeth within the church today to remove men like this. It's up to the pope. Now Francis, to his credit, has removed two bishops from Latin America who were accused of abuse. And he promulgated a law which laid out penalties for any Vatican employee, including cardinals and bishops working in Rome, over child abuse and financial crimes, particularly money laundering. The one person who really made headlines with his arrest was the Polish archbishop, formally the papal ambassador, or nuncio, in the Dominican Republic, and he was awaiting trial last year when he died. So he has put one mechanism in place. But the larger problem is to have a systematic way to hold these cardinals and bishops who are found to be complicit accountable.

Mohamed Abrini admitted to authorities that he is the so-called man in the hat. It's another link between those Brussels bombings and the November attacks in Paris. Reporter Teri Schultz has more. TERI SCHULTZ, BYLINE: Brussels prosecutors say when confronted with the evidence they'd compiled, Mohamed Abrini confessed to being the much sought after (speaking French), the man in the hat at Brussels' Zaventem Airport. He's believed to have dropped off a suitcase packed with explosives on March 22, accompanying the two suicide bombers to their detonation points and then leaving the scene. (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO)UNIDENTIFIED MAN: (Speaking French). SCHULTZ: That's a video police released Thursday, a compilation of security camera footage tracking the man now known to be Abrini as he walked for some two hours into central Brussels from the airport. In his confession, prosecutors say he told them he dumped his jacket along the way and later sold that hat. (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO)UNIDENTIFIED MAN: (Speaking French). SCHULTZ: It's not yet known whether it was a tip from this video that led to Abrini's arrest Friday night, but even before the 31-year-old Belgian of Moroccan descent was the man in the hat, he was a wanted man. The search for him began just after the November attacks in Paris when surveillance video surfaced of him with his childhood friend, Salah Abdeslam, just days before the attacks. Abdeslam, believed to be the last living Paris perpetrator, was captured in March. Abrini's DNA was found in a car used by those attackers and in safehouses used by the network back in Brussels. Abrini's been charged with terrorist murders for that alleged role in the deaths of 130 people in Paris. And now, by admitting he was at the Brussels airport, Abrini provides a direct link between the two plots, connecting some of the dots Belgian investigators have been blamed for missing earlier. Belgian terror analyst Pieter van Ostaeyen says while these developments are important, they won't shut down extremist operations. Van Ostaeyen's been tracking terrorist recruitment in Belgium for years. And he says the prosecutor's announcement of an abrupt Abrini confession strikes him as strange. PIETER VAN OSTAEYEN: No, I don't buy the statement. SCHULTZ: Van Ostaeyen says while Abrini may be the man in the hat, it's not Islamic State's style to confess. So this could just be to distract investigators. VAN OSTAEYEN: I've been analyzing these guys' modus operandi in Europe since the beginning, and this is just off. There's no way that some guy like Mohamed Abrini would go out and say I was the guy in the hat. I sold my hat. And I'm going to tell you everything about my network. No way. No way. SCHULTZ: Three more men were charged Saturday along with Abrini, one of whom was filmed by security cameras buying the luggage used for the airport bombs. And then he was seen with a subway bomber in the Metro station. Van Ostaeyen says he believes there are more important operators out there still planning attacks. He thinks the Belgian government believes that too, and that's why they've decided not to lower the terror threat level from its current three out of a maximum four. That means the threat of an attack remains credible and possible. For NPR News, I'm Teri Schultz.

He's believed to have dropped off a suitcase packed with explosives on March 22, accompanying the two suicide bombers to their detonation points and then leaving the scene. (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO) UNIDENTIFIED MAN: (Speaking French). SCHULTZ: That's a video police released Thursday, a compilation of security camera footage tracking the man now known to be Abrini as he walked for some two hours into central Brussels from the airport. In his confession, prosecutors say he told them he dumped his jacket along the way and later sold that hat. (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO) UNIDENTIFIED MAN: (Speaking French). SCHULTZ: It's not yet known whether it was a tip from this video that led to Abrini's arrest Friday night, but even before the 31-year-old Belgian of Moroccan descent was the man in the hat, he was a wanted man. The search for him began just after the November attacks in Paris when surveillance video surfaced of him with his childhood friend, Salah Abdeslam, just days before the attacks. Abdeslam, believed to be the last living Paris perpetrator, was captured in March. Abrini's DNA was found in a car used by those attackers and in safehouses used by the network back in Brussels. Abrini's been charged with terrorist murders for that alleged role in the deaths of 130 people in Paris. And now, by admitting he was at the Brussels airport, Abrini provides a direct link between the two plots, connecting some of the dots Belgian investigators have been blamed for missing earlier. Belgian terror analyst Pieter van Ostaeyen says while these developments are important, they won't shut down extremist operations. Van Ostaeyen's been tracking terrorist recruitment in Belgium for years. And he says the prosecutor's announcement of an abrupt Abrini confession strikes him as strange. PIETER VAN OSTAEYEN: No, I don't buy the statement. SCHULTZ: Van Ostaeyen says while Abrini may be the man in the hat, it's not Islamic State's style to confess. So this could just be to distract investigators. VAN OSTAEYEN: I've been analyzing these guys' modus operandi in Europe since the beginning, and this is just off. There's no way that some guy like Mohamed Abrini would go out and say I was the guy in the hat. I sold my hat. And I'm going to tell you everything about my network. No way. No way. SCHULTZ: Three more men were charged Saturday along with Abrini, one of whom was filmed by security cameras buying the luggage used for the airport bombs. And then he was seen with a subway bomber in the Metro station. Van Ostaeyen says he believes there are more important operators out there still planning attacks. He thinks the Belgian government believes that too, and that's why they've decided not to lower the terror threat level from its current three out of a maximum four. That means the threat of an attack remains credible and possible. For NPR News, I'm Teri Schultz.", "section": "World", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

The KRG, as it's called, is broke. The Kurds, who are an ethically and linguistically distinct minority in Iraq as well as in neighboring Syria, Turkey, and Iran, have been at the forefront of the battle against ISIS. And between war, budget disputes with the central Iraqi government in Baghdad and the plummeting price of oil, Iraqi Kurdistan is financially on the ropes. One man charged with getting them off the ropes is in Washington this week - the KRG's deputy prime minister, Qubad Talabani. Welcome to the program. QUBAD TALABANI: Thank you very much for having me. SIEGEL: The Kurdistan Regional Government, which is a close ally to the U. S. , is broke, and you're here. How much money are you asking for, and what you hearing? TALABANI: We're facing simultaneous challenges in Kurdistan today. We are at war. We have a massive humanitarian crisis. We're housing 1. 8 million IDPs and refugees as internally displaced people. We're, at the same time, facing unprecedented fiscal and economic challenges in Kurdistan both as a result of the war but also as a result of Baghdad cutting our share of the federal budget of Iraq from 2014 up until now. This has led to us accumulating massive debt. And at the start of this year, we were operating on a fiscal operating deficit of close to $400 million per month. Now we've been able to enact some strategic reforms, some painful reforms. We've been able to whittle that number down to $100 million per month, but we are still in arrears towards our soldiers who are on the front lines and our civil servants who are working in the government. SIEGEL: If you don't get help, though, what are the consequences, do you think? TALABANI: The consequences are dire. ISIS is a threat to Iraq. It's a threat to Kurdistan. But the existential threat facing Kurdistan today is the economy. If we are not able to balance our budget to get Kurdistan out of this economic mess, it poses a direct threat to our ability to continue to hold the front lines against ISIS and ultimately degrade and ultimately destroy them as is our policy. SIEGEL: The agenda of issues facing the Kurdistan Regional Government as you've just described - it would be daunting for a much larger, truly independent state. Is there anything that any government and the Kurdistan regional government can do to actually solve all the things you've just described? TALABANI: We need support. We need help. We need direct budgetary support. We need technical support. We know what our illnesses are. We have diagnosed our problems. We have even charted a roadmap to get ourselves out of this fiscal and economic mess that we are in right now, but we cannot do this alone. SIEGEL: Some of the problems that Iraqi Kurdistan is now experiencing would be problems no matter what - the number of people who have fled from other regions to find refuge there, for example, and the war against ISIS. But the fact that oil prices are very low and the fact that Kurdistan is selling oil, I guess, at prices below the world price for odd, internal Iraqi reasons - that seems to really compound the economic crisis of your region right now. Can - do you simply need a higher price of oil to get out of the doldrums right now? Does that place a check on everything else were talking about? TALABANI: The low oil prices has had a massive impact to our current economic state, but on the other hand, it's actually been a blessing because had it not been for the crash in oil prices, we wouldn't be looking at some of the reform initiatives that were undertaking right now. We wouldn't be looking at reducing subsidies. We wouldn't be looking at taking the government out of key sectors such as fuel and electricity. We wouldn't be looking at restructuring the size of our civil service and some of the real reforms that we've undertaken. So we're not letting this crisis go to waste. We're doing everything we can, but we cannot do this alone. SIEGEL: Qubad Talabani, deputy prime minister of the Kurdistan Regional Government of Iraq, thank you very much for talking with us.

The documents suggest that the firm helped high-ranking political figures, sport stars and celebrities all over the world hide their money. The case sheds new light on the process of tax evasion - the shell corporations and secret accounts. As NPR's James Zarroli reports, it is a huge business that's growing. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: It is shockingly easy to set up a shell corporation. Economist Gabriel Zucman says you just go online, pay a little money, fill out some documents and it's done. GABRIEL ZUCMAN: Now you're the owner of a company that can open, for instance, bank accounts all around the world. It makes it easier for you to hide your identity and to be an anonymous owner of wealth everywhere in the world. ZARROLI: And if you really want to hide your money, you can set up multiple interlinked shell corporations, says Tom Cardamone, managing director of Global Financial Integrity. TOM CARDAMONE: You can create an anonymous shell in one jurisdiction. It controls an anonymous trust in a completely different country that also controls a bank account in a third country, all of which can be completely opaque to law enforcement or tax authorities. ZARROLI: And Cardamone says none of this violates any laws. CARDAMONE: There's nothing illegal about setting up such a corporation. It's what happens after that that can cause a problem. Whether it's tax evasion or money laundering, you actually don't know what these entities are doing, and that's the crux of the problem. ZARROLI: There are hundreds, perhaps thousands of companies that will help you set up a shell corporation, including a great many in the United States. The Internet is filled with ads for them. (SOUNDBITE OF ADVERTISEMENT)UNIDENTIFIED MAN: In this video, you will learn about how an offshore corporation gives you maximum asset protect and financial privacy - legally, affordably, anonymously. ZARROLI: Most of these firms don't actually set up shell corporations themselves. They turn to much larger firms that specialize in the practice. Among these, Mossack Fonseca is considered one of the largest, although it can be hard to gauge how big it really is. Gabriel Zucman, author of the book \"The Hidden Wealth Of Nations,\" says the whole business is so shrouded in secrecy, any estimates of its size are at best educated guesses. Zucman says what is clear is that the business is getting bigger. ZUCMAN: A growing fraction of the world's wealth, in particular the wealth in tax havens, is owned via shell companies. So it's obviously a business that is booming and is doing extremely well. ZARROLI: For example, Zucman says, 60 percent of the wealth held in Swiss bank accounts is now owned by shell corporations whose owners are nearly impossible to trace. And as the business has gotten bigger, it's attracted a lot of investment dollars. Over the years, private equity firms such as The Carlyle Group have made big investments in some of the largest firms. Jason Sharman is a professor of political science at Griffith University in Australia. JASON SHARMAN: I think they saw this as a growth industry, obviously something that particularly was experiencing strong growth from the developing world, particularly China. And it was kind of a new industry that hadn't attracted much attention from outsiders before. ZARROLI: In recent years, the United States and other developed countries have made new efforts to crack down on tax shelters. They have begun to require major banks to provide much more information about accounts held by shell corporations. And regulators say this is making a dent in the problem. But Gabriel Zucman is skeptical these banks are really ready to cooperate. ZUCMAN: You know, after all for decades they've been exactly the opposite. You know, they've been helping their clients evade taxes, hiding them behind shell companies. And so, you know, we can ask ourselves, you know, is it just enough to now ask these very same individuals and these very same institutions to now play the tax man's job?

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PRISONER: We're not China. SIEGEL: A video posted online shows about a dozen Taiwanese nationals in a prison cell in Kenya. And they're using their collective bodyweight to keep the door shut and stay inside their cell. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)SIEGEL: The prisoners had actually been acquitted in a Kenyan court. But instead of releasing the Taiwanese prisoners, the Kenyan government handed them over to China. And China doesn't recognize the Taiwanese government. Well, now Taiwanese authorities say that they will sue Kenyan police for what they call illegal abductions. And for more on this story I'm joined now by NPR's Gregory Warner in Nairobi. Hi, Gregory. GREGORY WARNER, BYLINE: Hi there, Robert. SIEGEL: And let's start with how these Taiwanese nationals got in that Kenyan jail cell in the first place. WARNER: Well, the said journey really began in 2014. And at that time Kenyan police were responding to a building fire in a slum area of Nairobi. They happened to discover a room of fancy computer equipment. And the Kenyans at that time were very worried about cybercrime. They arrested the men that they found there on charges of hacking into Kenyan banks, which was a bit ludicrous. They were acquitted on those charges. However, instead of being released, they were handed over to Chinese authorities who then put them on a plane to Beijing. Now, Beijing says it's going to try these men with a different crime - telephone fraud. And these are these phone scams that a lot of Chinese citizens in China complain about and that con millions of dollars from ordinary Chinese. SIEGEL: Now, Taiwan says this violates international law and the rights of its citizens. And Taiwan is planning a lawsuit against the Kenyan police. What is the Kenyan response to that? WARNER: Well, this is actually not the first time this has happened where accused Taiwanese criminals arrested in a third country are deported to China. And Kenya's response is simply, Kenya has no official relations with Taiwan. It does not recognize the existence of Taiwan. And it has a very cozy, very lucrative relationship with China, which has financed billions of dollars of development projects. So Kenya falling in with Beijing's wishes is not really a surprise here. What is worth noting though is the way that China and the language that China has used to defend itself - or in this case not really defend itself. The Chinese authorities could have taken a very different tact to this whole thing. It said, look, this is a matter of national security. These Taiwanese were allegedly committing phone scams against Chinese nationals. Phone scams are a big problem. China did not do that. Instead China reiterated their One-China policy that Taiwan does not exist. And the spokesman for China's Foreign Ministry even issued a kind of threat. He said that the One-China policy is an important precondition for bilateral relations with China and other countries. So he really seems that they're drawing a line in the sand, sending a message to these African countries that you're either with us or you're against us. SIEGEL: Yeah, you mentioned Kenya's lucrative relationship with China. China has deepened its relationship with African countries over the past few years, recently announcing that the first Chinese overseas military base would be in Africa. Is this a sign that China's playing hardball and using African countries - in this case Kenya - as its allies? WARNER: It certainly wants to. And there's no doubt that China wants to send a very strong message to Taiwan and specifically to Taiwan's new president, Tsai Ing-wen, who was elected this year. And she was elected with a mandate to stand up more to China, to be less accommodating, less cooperative. So China wants to flex its muscle. I think the question though is what happens next time when it's not an alleged Taiwanese con artist that's being picked up but a Taiwanese blogger or a perceived Taiwanese activist or even a Taiwanese businessperson? Because this is a time when Taiwan has expressed the desire to do more business with Africa. Can China, because of its presence there, essentially block that whole relationship? SIEGEL: That's NPR East Africa correspondent Gregory Warner in Nairobi. Greg, thanks. WARNER: Thank you, Robert.

SIEGEL: A video posted online shows about a dozen Taiwanese nationals in a prison cell in Kenya. And they're using their collective bodyweight to keep the door shut and stay inside their cell. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) SIEGEL: The prisoners had actually been acquitted in a Kenyan court. But instead of releasing the Taiwanese prisoners, the Kenyan government handed them over to China. And China doesn't recognize the Taiwanese government. Well, now Taiwanese authorities say that they will sue Kenyan police for what they call illegal abductions. And for more on this story I'm joined now by NPR's Gregory Warner in Nairobi. Hi, Gregory. GREGORY WARNER, BYLINE: Hi there, Robert. SIEGEL: And let's start with how these Taiwanese nationals got in that Kenyan jail cell in the first place. WARNER: Well, the said journey really began in 2014. And at that time Kenyan police were responding to a building fire in a slum area of Nairobi. They happened to discover a room of fancy computer equipment. And the Kenyans at that time were very worried about cybercrime. They arrested the men that they found there on charges of hacking into Kenyan banks, which was a bit ludicrous. They were acquitted on those charges. However, instead of being released, they were handed over to Chinese authorities who then put them on a plane to Beijing. Now, Beijing says it's going to try these men with a different crime - telephone fraud. And these are these phone scams that a lot of Chinese citizens in China complain about and that con millions of dollars from ordinary Chinese. SIEGEL: Now, Taiwan says this violates international law and the rights of its citizens. And Taiwan is planning a lawsuit against the Kenyan police. What is the Kenyan response to that? WARNER: Well, this is actually not the first time this has happened where accused Taiwanese criminals arrested in a third country are deported to China. And Kenya's response is simply, Kenya has no official relations with Taiwan. It does not recognize the existence of Taiwan. And it has a very cozy, very lucrative relationship with China, which has financed billions of dollars of development projects. So Kenya falling in with Beijing's wishes is not really a surprise here. What is worth noting though is the way that China and the language that China has used to defend itself - or in this case not really defend itself. The Chinese authorities could have taken a very different tact to this whole thing. It said, look, this is a matter of national security. These Taiwanese were allegedly committing phone scams against Chinese nationals. Phone scams are a big problem. China did not do that. Instead China reiterated their One-China policy that Taiwan does not exist. And the spokesman for China's Foreign Ministry even issued a kind of threat. He said that the One-China policy is an important precondition for bilateral relations with China and other countries. So he really seems that they're drawing a line in the sand, sending a message to these African countries that you're either with us or you're against us. SIEGEL: Yeah, you mentioned Kenya's lucrative relationship with China. China has deepened its relationship with African countries over the past few years, recently announcing that the first Chinese overseas military base would be in Africa. Is this a sign that China's playing hardball and using African countries - in this case Kenya - as its allies? WARNER: It certainly wants to. And there's no doubt that China wants to send a very strong message to Taiwan and specifically to Taiwan's new president, Tsai Ing-wen, who was elected this year. And she was elected with a mandate to stand up more to China, to be less accommodating, less cooperative. So China wants to flex its muscle. I think the question though is what happens next time when it's not an alleged Taiwanese con artist that's being picked up but a Taiwanese blogger or a perceived Taiwanese activist or even a Taiwanese businessperson? Because this is a time when Taiwan has expressed the desire to do more business with Africa. Can China, because of its presence there, essentially block that whole relationship? SIEGEL: That's NPR East Africa correspondent Gregory Warner in Nairobi. Greg, thanks. WARNER: Thank you, Robert.", "section": "World", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.

Near as experts can figure from his splotchy tracks, Mr. Inky - somehow he deserves that honorific - squeezed through a slight gap at the top of his tank, flopped to the floor, then slithered about eight feet overland to slide down a drain pipe more than 160 feet long and finally to plop into the bay.

The escape apparently happened several months ago but was only certified in the past few days. Rob Yarrall, the aquarium's manager, told Radio New Zealand that employees had searched the aquarium's pipes but found no trace of Inky.

He invited the refugees, 12 people including six children, to leave with him after his visit this weekend to Lesbos, the Greek island off the coast of Turkey that has been inundated by migrants trying to make their way to Europe. Reporter Joanna Kakissis is on the island of Lesbos. She joins me now. Joanna, good morning. JOANNA KAKISSIS, BYLINE: Good morning, Rachel. MARTIN: And we've also got NPR's Sylvia Poggioli. She has been covering the pope and she stayed behind in Greece to speak with us. Sylvia, thanks for being with us. SYLVIA POGGIOLI, BYLINE: Thank you. MARTIN: Sylvia, let's start with you. What do you know about these Syrian refugees and how this extraordinary invitation came about by Pope Francis? POGGIOLI: Well, the pope said that one of his aides suggested the idea just a week ago. And he immediately agreed, saying it fit the spirit of his visit to Lesbos. They were apparently chosen by lottery, two families from Damascus and one from an area under ISIS control. The group includes six children. The pope was asked why the refugees are all Muslim. And he said that there was something missing in the documents of a Christian family that had originally been on the list. Now thanks to arrangements made with the Italian government by the charitable Sant'Egidio community in Rome, the three families will be given humanitarian visas and will apply for asylum. And last night, after they landed in Rome, they were given a festive welcome by a band of drummers and cheering crowds. MARTIN: So Joanna, Lesbos has been this landing point for hundreds of thousands of people seeking entry into Europe. You've been covering this for a long time. What are you seeing on Lesbos right now? What did you see when Francis was there? KAKISSIS: So you're not seeing many refugees on Lesbos anymore. The Greek coast guard's only picking up about a hundred asylum seekers a day at sea at most. And compare that to the thousands who were arriving daily just a year ago. And those who arrived after March 20 are held in a detention camp surrounded by an iron fence. That's happening because the European Union and Turkey agreed to a deal late last month that's focused on deporting migrants. The pope and Bartholomew I, he's the Ecumenical Patriarch of the Eastern Orthodox Church - they spent a couple of hours with asylum-seekers at this detention camp. MARTIN: More broadly, Joanna, how did the Greeks respond to the visit? KAKISSIS: Well, as I mentioned, the Greeks really welcomed the pope's visit. They were cheering for him. And I met a woman named Vasiliki Stylianopoulos Moore just outside the port. She's a Greek-American from New Hampshire, and she's volunteering with refugees here now. And she sees Pope Francis as an ally. VASILIKI STYLIANOPOULOS  MOORE: So we're so encouraged to see him and the patriarch together and also for - as a symbol to the European Union and to all of humanity that we must welcome people and offer hospitality where we can. KAKISSIS: The Greeks really appreciate that Pope Francis supports the underdog. He spoke in support of Greeks as they've slogged through an economic crisis. And now he's standing by them as they managed the refugee crisis. MARTIN: Sylvia, lastly, the pope's visit was clearly a powerful symbol, as was the act of taking in these refugees. But does that symbolism extend into anything pragmatic that could change something about this refugee crisis? POGGIOLI: Well, it's too soon to say. The visit was triggered by that controversial EU-Turkey deportation deal. And EU officials are very happy that the number of arrivals here has plummeted since the deal went into effect. The Vatican insists the visit and the gesture to take the refugees back to Rome was humanitarian. But it was also clearly meant to prick the conscience of many European countries that are locking migrants out. The pope said he was very shaken by the children he met at the deportation center. He showed a picture an Afghan child gave him of a sun weeping over a sea where migrants had drowned. The pope said if the sun is able to weep, so can we. A tear would do us good. And in their joint declaration, the pope and the two Orthodox leaders quoted a verse from the Gospel of Matthew - all will be judged by their actions.

CHRIS ARNOLD, BYLINE: If you're Bernie Sanders and you want to get your supporters fired up at a rally, bashing trade deals like NAFTA and the TPP is a good way to go.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: It's a deal that was designed for China to come in, as they always do, through the back door and totally take advantage of everyone. And we don't have smart people making the deal. (APPLAUSE)ARNOLD: Actually, China isn't even a part of the TPP trade deal, so as far as Trump's comments there. . . DAVID AUTOR: That's off-the-scales wrong. ARNOLD: David Autor is a labor economist at MIT. He says the political rhetoric is often a confused mess, but he says it's tapping into something that's very real. AUTOR: I think what politicians are correctly responding to is the reality that the last 35 years have been bad ones for blue-collar Americans. ARNOLD: Wages have been stagnant, and millions of manufacturing jobs have disappeared. Now, you can't just blame trade, though. Technology plays a very big role here. With computers and automation, factories in all kinds of other workplaces need fewer people, and that kills a lot of jobs. Autor says by comparison, if you look at NAFTA and trade with Mexico, that really has not been very harmful for U. S. workers, but China - his research shows that's a different story. AUTOR: China's rise is really kind of a world historical event. This is the largest country in the world. It has caused a wholesale substantial contraction of U. S. manufacturing employment. ARNOLD: Autor says in less than a decade, starting in the year 2000, trade with China destroyed about 1 million U. S. manufacturing jobs. Now, trade theory doesn't say that all workers will be protected. It says that trade will make both countries better off. But what happened here? OK, let's forget about China for a moment and consider U. S. trade with another country - France. The U. S. makes good airplanes and cars, of course, and the French - well, the French make good cheese. ARNOLD: Have a little bag of. . . AUTOR: Oh, my God. ARNOLD: . . . My goodies. AUTOR: OK. ARNOLD: So here I have some French cheeses. AUTOR: OK, there we go. ARNOLD: I'm sitting with David Autor in his office at MIT, and in the middle of our interview, I pull out some useful items to help him explain how trade is supposed to work. ARNOLD: For you, David, I brought some. . . AUTOR: OK. ARNOLD: . . . Little cars. AUTOR: Matchboxes. ARNOLD: Yeah. AUTOR: Matchbox cars. ARNOLD: So I'll be France, and you're America with the cars. So how does this work where we both win? AUTOR: I say, you know, you make some really good gourmet food there, Chris, and we'd sure like to eat it. I guess I could take some of my Chevy workers, and I could say, you know, go spend two days a week making cheese, and you know, stop putting on hubcaps. But they probably wouldn't be very good at it, and the end result would be. . . ARNOLD: Bad cheese. AUTOR: . . . Bad cheese, fewer cars. ARNOLD: So instead of that. . . AUTOR: Why don't we just trade? And I'll give you some trucks, and you give me some gourmet food, and we'll both be doing the think that we're good at. We'll be focusing on our area of compared advantage. ARNOLD: And this is the magic of trade. With two countries doing what they're best at with the same number of workers and the same amount of money invested together, they can create more higher-quality stuff than either of them could separately. In a sense, it creates wealth for both countries. China was a bit different, though, because for one thing, it was a huge, and it began exporting all kinds of things that U. S. manufacturers were already making, just doing it cheaper. And much more quickly than economists predicted, China was able to transform its rural society with about a billion low-wage workers into a cheap-labor manufacturing superpower. AUTOR: It was the proverbial boulder, you know, sitting at the top of a mountain for a hundred years. And one day, it just started to roll down, and you know, it is rather disruptive to those in the valley below. ARNOLD: That would be the American manufacturing workers getting squashed by the Chinese boulder. AUTOR: I mean, I don't want to go to far with that analogy because we still win from trade with China. ARNOLD: Everything from the shoes that you're wearing, your watch, kitchen appliances, your phone - so many things in our lives are cheaper because of international trade that overall, despite the loss of jobs, Autor says that the U. S. and China still both come out ahead. The problem, though, is that these benefits are diffuse, but the harm, the pain - that's concentrated. AUTOR: If I lose my job at a furniture factory where I've worked for decades, no amount of sort of, you know, cheaper toys and raincoats at Walmart is going to make me whole again.

They killed at least 28 people and injured more than 300 in a suicide bombing today in Kabul, and that was followed by a gun battle. The capital of Afghanistan has seen a lot of violence over the years, but today's bomb attack was unusually large. NPR's Philip Reeves says residents are in shock. PHILIP REEVES, BYLINE: We're beside the Kabul River. It runs through the middle of Afghanistan's capital. Bahram Hakimi has come here to squat on a wall, smoke a cigarette and gaze at the brown water rushing by. He says he hopes this will calm him after the terrible experience he went through a few hours earlier a few hundred yards from here. BAHRAM HAKIMI: (Foreign language spoken). REEVES: Hakimi says he was asleep in his car when the bomb detonated. The blast was so strong. . . HAKIMI: (Foreign language spoken). REEVES: . . . It knocked him out and shattered all his car windows. HAKIMI: (Foreign language spoken). REEVES: Hakimi says once he came to his senses and discovered that, amazingly, he wasn't hurt, he helped several of the hundreds of injured get away from the carnage. Hakimi is young, just 21. As he stares down at the river rushing by, he's full of gloom about his country's future. HAKIMI: (Foreign language spoken). REEVES: \"Afghanistan is clearly heading for disaster,\" he says. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: (Foreign language spoken). REEVES: At the scene itself, the police shoo away onlookers who've come to see the damage caused by a blast that everyone heard for miles around. This is the area where the bombing took place. The actual detonation site is a couple of hundred yards from where I'm standing. Close by, I can see the target of the attack, which is a big, long, low, blue and gray building, heavily fortified. And in that building, Afghanistan's national security agency has a special elite unit that provides special security for government VIPs. Down the end of the building, a lot of wreckage on the streets and some twisted vehicles. Remember, this is the middle of Kabul. Afghanistan's Ministry of Defense is close by, just over the river. This is the most fortified cities in the world, yet a Taliban suicide bomber was able to drive in here in a vehicle packed with explosives. HASHMAT RANJBER: I'm really disappointed because they're so near to the ministry, there's explosions. I think it's a disappointment for us. REEVES: That's Hashmat Ranjber, a project manager with the Foreign Ministry. He says he has disappointments with the Afghan government of President Ashraf Ghani and Chief Executive Abdullah Abdullah. RANJBER: They cannot do for our Afghanistan people anything. Just only they are speeching in their TV, they are appearing in media. They are talking the people, we are bringing the peace in Afghanistan, but no. REEVES: These days, you hear a lot of criticism like this of the Afghan government. Its popularity has plunged. Afghanistan's complained it's paralyzed by infighting. The U. N. envoy to Afghanistan recently said it would be an achievement if the government survives the year.

At this hour, at least 28 are dead and more than 300 injured. The attack fulfilled the Taliban's promise that a spring offensive was about to begin in Afghanistan. And the Taliban did claim responsibility for this suicide bombing. NPR's Philip Reeves has more. PHILIP REEVES, BYLINE: Well, this was a very big blast. It echoed right across Kabul. It rattled windows, it shattered windows and it sent a plume of gray, black smoke, like a big mushroom, hundreds of feet up into the air in the skies above the city. It happened at rush hour, so that might explain the high number of casualties. The target was the Afghan national security agency. The Taliban say they were trying to hit a unit of that agency, an elite unit that provides special security for Afghan government VIPs. MONTAGNE: How was it possible for attackers to get even close enough to do a lot of damage to a building that one would think was as secure as it gets in Kabul? REEVES: Well, you know, this is a city in which many buildings have been converted into forts. It's a city of roadblocks, of security cameras, of men in uniform with Kalashnikovs on every corner, of diplomats who, for months, have been on total lockdown in Kabul. And yet, the Taliban is operational in the heart of this city. In this case, they brought a car bomb, or a vehicle bomb, into the area, detonated that. And it appears that Taliban militants then came in after that and a long gun battle ensued. MONTAGNE: So what does this say about the broader security picture in Afghanistan generally? REEVES: Well, Renee, if you talk to Afghans who follow this conflict day by day, they'll tell you that the Taliban is more powerful now than at any time since the U. S. -led invasion of Afghanistan in 2002 and toppled the Taliban government. You know, and we're seeing the effect of the escalating conflict in numbers. The U. N. released figures the other day that said that if you count the injured, civilian casualties here are up again in the first quarter of this year. Matters are not helped by the fragility of the Afghan government and its waning popularity, all by a mass exodus of young Afghans to Europe by high unemployment, by the absence of any credible progress towards a peace process and, of course, the need this year, Renee, for Afghanistan to generate still more funding from an international community that is heartily sick of this conflict. MONTAGNE: And this would also seem to bode not well for security in the coming spring and summer, which is the normal fighting season. REEVES: Yes, the U. N. 's envoy the other day warned that this is going to be a very difficult fighting season. And it seems that this is already proving to be the case only a week after the Taliban announced the start of their spring offensive. Afghanistan's security agency says there've also been attempts which they've intercepted to carry out attacks here in Kabul, one against the airport and one against a hotel here.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)ASH CARTER: We're going to make available attack helicopters in support of the ISF's ongoing efforts to envelop and then retake Mosul.

There are now some 5,000 U. S. troops in Iraq. And U. S. officials say there could be more U. S. troops sent before Iraqi forces mount an attack on Mosul in the coming months. Most of them are trainers, but there are hundreds of special operators tracking down ISIS leaders with Kurdish forces in both Syria and Iraq. Finally, the U.

(CROSSTALK)MCEVERS: The students gathered in one room, and while the mood could seem jolly, they were trying to learn something hard - how to talk about suicide. They are in a remote seaside town in Greenland. And what you need to know about Greenland is this. It has the world's highest known rate of suicide - six times higher than the rate in the U. S. It's not just because of the cold or the darkness. Joblessness, racism and alcoholism all play a role. Rebecca Hersher has this story from Greenland on how hard it is to save people from themselves. REBECCA HERSHER, BYLINE: I arrived in Greenland in January, and almost immediately I heard that two people in the same community had killed themselves. I actually saw it on Facebook. Emergency in East Greenland, a friend of a friend wrote; so scared for my family and friends in Tasiilaq - two suicides in two weeks in Tasiilaq, a place with just 3,000 people. Would more deaths follow? So I went there on a plane and then a helicopter. It was the middle of winter. So this is Tasiilaq. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Yeah, this is Tasiilaq. HERSHER: I arrived in Tasiilaq on a Saturday. The sky was totally clear. If you're imagining Tasiilaq as sad and dark, think again. The mountains around town are pointy and huge. The sun and the snow is so bright that you need sunglasses. In the center of town, there were kids sledding in the streets and playing soccer in snow boots. One of the first people I reach out to is Julius Nielsen. JULIUS NIELSEN: Testing, testing. HERSHER: He describes himself as a father, hunter, electrician. NIELSEN: And family man - girlfriend the last 20 years, so we have been together since we is teenagers. HERSHER: Nielsen was a close friend of a man named Pele Kristiansen. Pele was this really fun guy - drank a lot, kind of a goofball. On January 9 of this year, they were hanging out, and that day was particularly memorable because there was a polar bear near town. All these guys hunt polar bears for meat and skin, and you can make a lot of money if you shoot one. NIELSEN: And Pele, this stupid guy, he just take the rifle and shoot the polar bear. HERSHER: That day, Pele shot the polar bear. NIELSEN: He was so happy to. . . HERSHER: That's what Nielsen remembers. He was so happy. But the next morning, Pele Kristiansen was dead. He had killed himself. He was 22. NIELSEN: I don't know why, and I cannot explain why. HERSHER: Just two weeks later, the next death - a 15-year-old boy named Peter Pilanat went drinking with his friends on Friday night. The next morning, his grandparents found his body. This is a scary moment for a town - any town. Two young people dead in two weeks - it's a potential indicator that suicide could become contagious, spread among people who are already at risk. Sometimes they're called suicide clusters, and they've happened here in the U. S. , too. After the second death, Nielsen was afraid that's what was happening in Tasiilaq. It had happened before. When he was a teenager, he had lost seven friends to suicide. Now he worried about his kids. NIELSEN: To be a parent in this case, it's - (laughter) you feel powerless, helpless. HERSHER: A lot of people in Tasiilaq were feeling same way - powerless, as if the whole town was just waiting for the next person to die. So people started to do things, anything they could think of. The day after the 15-year-old killed himself, Tasiilaq's youth leaders organized a town meeting. A police officer, a social worker, a nurse and a priest all went. All that next week at school, the guidance counselor met personally with every teenager, but although a lot of the kids cried, no one talked. In fact, it was impossible to get most of the teenagers to open up. And then, a week after Peter's suicide, another teenager tried to kill himself. At that point, a local public health worker called her counterpart in Greenland's capital and said, we can't do this alone; we need help. Now, ideally, in the U. S. , we handle crises like this one by sending teams of psychologists and grief counselors. It's really intensive. But here's the thing about Greenland. There simply are not enough mental health professionals. Only 56,000 people live in the whole country. So they sent what they had - a few social workers and family therapists on two week rotations plus something specifically for the young people in town - a course about how to talk about suicide. All the 10th graders are excused from class for three days to do it. The course is being held in a big, loud community hall in the center of Tasiilaq. Fifteen-year-old Paul-Ib Uisatikitseq arrives with ear buds in. He looks a little anxious as he sits down. Are you nervous? PAUL-IB UISATIKITSEQ: No, exciting. HERSHER: Excited. I follow Paul-Ib and his friend Jonas Madsen as they do one of the activities. They're joking around, mostly ignoring me. (LAUGHTER)HERSHER: The assignment is written on these little cards. As they read it, they get really serious. It's a role-playing exercise where one of them has to play a suicidal person. Neither one wants to, so they rock-paper-scissors. Jonas loses, so he has to play the suicidal one. JONAS MADSEN: (Foreign language spoken). HERSHER: \"I'm sad,\" says Jonas. \"I don't want to live anymore. \"PAUL-IB: (Foreign language spoken). HERSHER: \"Why are you sad,\" says Paul-Ib. JONAS: (Foreign language spoken). HERSHER: \"Because my girlfriend doesn't like me anymore,\" says Jonas. \"I want to kill myself. \" At that point, neither of them seems to know what to say. They're focusing so completely. It's as if they think, if they can just find the right words, maybe they can prevent another death. JONAS: (Foreign language spoken). PAUL-IB: (Foreign language spoken). HERSHER: As the exercise ends and the other kids start to leave the room, they both turn to me and say something they didn't seem able to talk about before the role play. PAUL-IB: One of my friends - he killed himself maybe two weeks ago. He was good friend, one of the best friends. JONAS: Best friends. HERSHER: One of your best friends. JONAS: We supported each other. HERSHER: Yeah. JONAS: Like, I really want to help him. Just, like, I want to support him. HERSHER: Jonas puts his head in his hands. Paul-Ib comforts him. Of course, they're talking about Peter. The 15-year-old boy who killed himself was their best friend. The whole time I was in Greenland for weeks and weeks, I was trying to understand the numbers behind the suicide crisis - the rate, the highest known in the world - 80 per hundred thousand - a total population of just 56,000 - all the numbers so abstract. And so I would resort to the anecdotal, asking people, what is it like to live in a place with so many suicides for you, for your family? And most of them settled on the same word - normal. In Greenland, suicide is normal. They don't mean it's OK or that it's not tragic. They mean it's so common that sometimes the next death seems inevitable. But until I met the kids in Tasiilaq, I didn't understand another deeper part of what it's like. Every suicide steals something the people left behind - a sense of security, of resilience. It's one reason suicide everywhere, whether it's the Arctic or right here in the U. S. , is so hard to prevent because even as it wipes out one generation, it breaks down the next. For NPR News, I'm Rebecca Hersher. MCEVERS: Rebecca is NPR's Above the Fray fellow. The fellowship is sponsored by the John Alexander Project.

In fact, it was impossible to get most of the teenagers to open up. And then, a week after Peter's suicide, another teenager tried to kill himself. At that point, a local public health worker called her counterpart in Greenland's capital and said, we can't do this alone; we need help. Now, ideally, in the U. S. , we handle crises like this one by sending teams of psychologists and grief counselors. It's really intensive. But here's the thing about Greenland. There simply are not enough mental health professionals. Only 56,000 people live in the whole country. So they sent what they had - a few social workers and family therapists on two week rotations plus something specifically for the young people in town - a course about how to talk about suicide. All the 10th graders are excused from class for three days to do it. The course is being held in a big, loud community hall in the center of Tasiilaq. Fifteen-year-old Paul-Ib Uisatikitseq arrives with ear buds in. He looks a little anxious as he sits down. Are you nervous? PAUL-IB UISATIKITSEQ: No, exciting. HERSHER: Excited. I follow Paul-Ib and his friend Jonas Madsen as they do one of the activities. They're joking around, mostly ignoring me. (LAUGHTER) HERSHER: The assignment is written on these little cards. As they read it, they get really serious. It's a role-playing exercise where one of them has to play a suicidal person. Neither one wants to, so they rock-paper-scissors. Jonas loses, so he has to play the suicidal one. JONAS MADSEN: (Foreign language spoken). HERSHER: \"I'm sad,\" says Jonas. \"I don't want to live anymore. \" PAUL-IB: (Foreign language spoken). HERSHER: \"Why are you sad,\" says Paul-Ib. JONAS: (Foreign language spoken). HERSHER: \"Because my girlfriend doesn't like me anymore,\" says Jonas. \"I want to kill myself. \" At that point, neither of them seems to know what to say. They're focusing so completely. It's as if they think, if they can just find the right words, maybe they can prevent another death. JONAS: (Foreign language spoken). PAUL-IB: (Foreign language spoken). HERSHER: As the exercise ends and the other kids start to leave the room, they both turn to me and say something they didn't seem able to talk about before the role play. PAUL-IB: One of my friends - he killed himself maybe two weeks ago. He was good friend, one of the best friends. JONAS: Best friends. HERSHER: One of your best friends. JONAS: We supported each other. HERSHER: Yeah. JONAS: Like, I really want to help him. Just, like, I want to support him. HERSHER: Jonas puts his head in his hands. Paul-Ib comforts him. Of course, they're talking about Peter. The 15-year-old boy who killed himself was their best friend. The whole time I was in Greenland for weeks and weeks, I was trying to understand the numbers behind the suicide crisis - the rate, the highest known in the world - 80 per hundred thousand - a total population of just 56,000 - all the numbers so abstract. And so I would resort to the anecdotal, asking people, what is it like to live in a place with so many suicides for you, for your family? And most of them settled on the same word - normal. In Greenland, suicide is normal. They don't mean it's OK or that it's not tragic. They mean it's so common that sometimes the next death seems inevitable. But until I met the kids in Tasiilaq, I didn't understand another deeper part of what it's like. Every suicide steals something the people left behind - a sense of security, of resilience. It's one reason suicide everywhere, whether it's the Arctic or right here in the U. S. , is so hard to prevent because even as it wipes out one generation, it breaks down the next.

Located in Mali on the southern edge of the Sahara Desert, in fact, the city served for centuries as an Islamic cultural and intellectual Mecca, where, despite occupations and invasions, people preserved and restored priceless texts dating to the Middle Ages. Then came 2012, when radical Muslims linked to al-Qaida invaded. They didn't see these texts as part of their heritage but rather as contradicting their interpretation of Islam. Elsewhere, they were destroying beloved cultural icons. Librarians feared the city's prized manuscripts would be next. Enter  Abdel Kader Haidara. He oversaw a secret plot to smuggle out more than 300,000 manuscripts. It's a remarkable story captured by the new book out this month. The title is a little salty but fitting the subject. It's called \"The Bad-Ass Librarians Of Timbuktu. \" I spoke with author Joshua Hammer, a former Newsweek bureau chief and editor to Smithsonian Magazine. And I started by asking him why these texts were so highly prized. JOSHUA HAMMER: Well, these volumes - and we're talking about hundreds of thousands of them - at the point in which al-Qaida invaded Timbuktu, there were something like 370,000 manuscripts amassed in libraries in Timbuktu. And they portrayed Islam, as practiced in this corner of the world, as a blend of the secular and the religious, or they show that the two could co-exist beautifully. And they did in this city. So it was tremendously important for Haidara and those who supported him to protect and preserve these manuscripts as evidence of both Mali's former greatness and the tolerance that that form of Islam encouraged. MARTIN: Well, tell me then again - and Abdel Kader Haidara, what was his role in all of this? Well, tell me just - first of all, tell us who he is. HAMMER: Abdel Kader Haidara was a son of a scholar, and he grew up in an intellectual environment in Timbuktu. He was not a wealthy person. After his father's death in the early 1980s, he inherited the family's centuries-old manuscript collection. So in 1984, the head of the Ahmed Baba Institute, the government-owned library in Timbuktu, called on Haidara and said hey, we're having trouble getting off the ground. We need to find manuscripts. We know they're out there. They're hidden away in the desert on river towns. Can you undertake this job of traveling around northern Mali, tracking down these manuscripts that have been lost, buried, disappeared over generations? Gather them up, we'll give you money. And we want this library to be splendid. We want this to be something that people from all around the world will come to visit. He was reluctant at first, but the call of duty and the curator's constant pressure prevailed. And in 1984, he began this - what turned into a 12-year really amazing quest to ferret out these manuscripts all across Mali. MARTIN: So then he did that and persuaded families to part with these treasured items. And then another chapter, not such a happy one. . . HAMMER: Another chapter - another chapter, not such a happy one. In 2011, the Arab Spring breaks out - Gadhafi's downfall, the arsenals of Libya and the chaos of Gadhafi's murder and the disintegration of the Libyan state are opened for the taking. Then you've got these various rebel groups in Mali. You've got Islamic radicals all descending on Libya on these arsenals, walking in, loading up their pickup trucks with heavy weaponry, driving through the dust across the desert back to Mali. And so these heavily-armed rebels sweep across the desert and in three months have captured two-thirds of the country. MARTIN: So tell us a bit about what was the atmosphere in Timbuktu. Tell me why did Abdel Kader Haidara decide to do what he did. HAMMER: Yeah, well, the first thing that Abdel Kader was worried about frankly was looting. In the first few days after the rebels took over Timbuktu and the army and the police had fled, there was total disorder. That's when he kind of began to scheme - hey, you know, our - the great treasures of Timbuktu are being held in these very ostentatious libraries. He said these are going to be targets. The looting subsided pretty quickly. But as it subsided you had this growing radicalism. You had Islamic police stopping people, throwing them in jail, grabbing cigarettes out of their mouths, whipping them in public. He just foresaw that this was going to get worse and that sooner or later, these manuscripts were going to be held hostage. They're going to become political tools. They could be destroyed in an act of vengeance, caught up in military action. We've got to protect them. So that's when Abdel Kader and a small group of his supporters, friends, relatives got together and began what ended up being a three-stage effort to protect and essentially smuggle to safety all of these manuscripts. MARTIN: So tell us a little bit if you would how they did it I know it's kind of hard for me to describe to people with a story of, you know, librarians at the center of it. But it really is kind of a heart-pounding experienceHAMMER: Let's remember that Abdel Kader was more than a librarian. This guy had spent 12 years as a bad-[expletive] explorer, as an adventurer. He was traveling on camels across the Sahara, on riverboats, going to small villages, finding these manuscripts. So he was an operator. So when the time came, he just knew what to do. He said the first thing we're going to do is get them out of these big libraries. We're going to take trunks. We're going to packed them into trunks at night when the rebels are asleep, and then we're going to move them in the dead of night by mule cart to these various houses - safe houses scattered around the city. And hopefully they'll be safe for the duration of this occupation. MARTIN: What would you say is the importance of this? What would you want people to think about when they think about this story? HAMMER: One of the things I think is important to draw from it is to realize that there is this whole strain of Islam that is moderate, that celebrates intellectuality, that celebrates culture, that celebrates diversity, secular ideas, poetry, love, human beauty. I think that is lost in this debate that's going on. But I think in fact that the Islam as represented by those in Timbuktu and the bad-[expletive] librarians is in fact more representative of what Islam is. MARTIN: Where are these texts now? Where are these manuscripts now, and is there an opportunity to have them be safeguarded from another spasm of violence like this? HAMMER: He hopes that they'll be able - that he'll be able to return them to Timbuktu. They're in about a dozen climate-controlled storage rooms in Bamako, the capital of Mali. And as far as moving them back, he's waiting. I mean, these are very hard people to root out. But I mean, Timbuktu is a ghost town. Tourists aren't going there. There aren't - flights aren't going there. It's very sad, and I don't know and he doesn't know when - if those glory days can ever be recaptured given the strength of the Islamists - the terrorists in that area, in that part of the world. MARTIN: That's Joshua Hammer. He's the author of a new book called \"The Bad-Ass Librarians Of Timbuktu. \" The book is available now, and we reached him in New York. Joshua, thanks so much for speaking with us. HAMMER: Thanks a lot for having me, Michel.

I'm Michel Martin. We're going to start with election-year politics. But we're going to talk about issue that's gotten candidates and voters riled up across the political spectrum. That issue is free trade. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)DONALD TRUMP: The TPP is a horrible deal. It's a deal that was designed for China to come in as they always do through the back door and totally take advantage of everyone. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TED CRUZ: We're getting killed in international trade right now. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)HILLARY CLINTON: We've learned a lot about trade agreements in the past years. Sometimes they look great on paper. Now looking back on it, it doesn't have the results we thought it would have. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BERNIE SANDERS: The TPP is just a new easy way for corporations to shut down in America and to send jobs abroad. MARTIN: That was Republican presidential candidates Donald Trump and Ted Cruz and Democratic candidates Hilary Clinton and Bernie Sanders all talking about the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal and free trade in general. We wanted to talk about why international free trade has struck such a nerve with Americans this year. So all this week, a group of NPR stations around the country participated in a coordinated conversation called A Nation Engaged. We're closing it out with NPR senior business editor Marilyn Geewax. Hi Marilyn. MARILYN GEEWAX, BYLINE: Hi Michel. MARTIN: And from the studios of Colorado Public Radio Megan Verlee. Megan, welcome to you as well. MEGAN VERLEE, BYLINE: Hi there. MARTIN: So let me just start out, Marilyn, by pointing out that actually for decades, the political parties have by and large supported big trade agreements that you hear about in the news. People will have heard about NAFTA. They will have heard about the TPP. Why has it turned around seemingly so much, and why is China such a focus of all of this anger? GEEWAX: Right. Let me just say that in the past, Republicans liked it because they tend to be pro-business, Democrats tended to like it because they tend to be internationalists. They see the world as being globalized, so you had a lot of support for it. But then we slammed into the Great Recession. A lot of the popularity of trade went down. Then when it comes to China, there's a lot of deep feeling about that because we all go into the store and we see those things made in China, and it seems like gosh, aren't they making everything these days? Well, China is not part of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. It's not one of the 12 nations involved. It's the United States, Japan, Australia - all these countries that are around the Pacific Rim but specifically not China. MARTIN: But the anger is real. Marilyn, could you talk a little bit more about this? GEEWAX: That individual anger is certainly real and justifiable. I mean, if you're one of the people that lost their jobs, you really hurt and your community is devastated. For example, this year we've had this kind of well-known case about Carrier. It's a company that makes air conditioning. And they announced they were closing a plant back in February, and they're moving all these jobs to Mexico. Well holy cow, if you're one of those people that just lost their job, this hurts a lot. The intense downside of trade is felt very much by people, and it makes it easy to point to examples like that if you're a political candidate. The thing that's tricky about trade is that this is a very large economy. It's almost a $19 trillion economy with 323 million people. A lot happens at once. The gains can be very diffused and they're spread out over the economy. For example, air conditioning is really cheap now. A lot of that is because of overseas production. MARTIN: You know, it's interesting because when a lot of our reporters, as we mentioned, across the country have been digging into this over the course of the week, they experienced that kind of mixed bag of opinion themselves. For example, in Los Angeles, Saul Gonzales from member station KCRW talked with truck drivers in California. They're delivering goods from one of the busiest ports in the U. S. Here's Brian Spencer making the case for how trade helps him personally. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)BRIAN SPENCER: How I pay my bills, how I take care of my family, etc. , etc. , is for the simple source of our trade system. You know, if nothing's coming and going, I'm sitting still, therefore I'm not making any money. I'm not making - you know, so I can't live. MARTIN: And here's another trucker Dennis Roach, who had a different opinion, less of a fan. Here it is. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)DENNIS ROACH: Jobs are going to foreign countries. We're shipping more product in from overseas. You know, I'd bet you go to anybody's house and look in their closet and it says Indonesia, China, Japan, Taiwan. There's very few things that'll say made in the U. S. A. MARTIN: Let's go to Megan Verlee now. You had a piece that ran on member station Colorado Public Radio. Tell us a little bit about it. Well, let's play it a bit from the piece then Megan you can tell us more. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)VERLEE: It's a quintessential Colorado scene. Grant Bledsoe's family has owned this Yuma County operation since the 1940's. This is what hungry calves sound like? GRANT BLEDSOE: They're just getting ready to go to grass for the summer time. VERLEE: These steers will eventually be going a lot further than that, or at least parts of them will. BLEDSOE: It's just amazing some of the products that get sold around the world, big demand for the diaphragm, the stomach, tripe to Mexico. MARTIN: So Megan, tell us a little bit more about your reporting. What were the opinions of the people that you interviewed? VERLEE: Well, like you've been saying, mixed from, you know, very traditional industries like beef production, which was shaped by NAFTA opening markets and now stands to really expand under the TPP into more Asian markets. On the one hand, we have people for whom the breaking down the barriers through trade deals is going to be a big plus. And I talked to workers who've been displaced because I think probably anywhere in the country you can find people who know that their jobs have moved overseas. MARTIN: You met two women at Starbucks, for example. You want to tell us about that? VERLEE: Yes. Venice Romero and Vanessa Abdurahman are really good friends. They met working at a T-Mobile call center, and they worked at that call center for more than a decade. And then a couple years ago, T-Mobile closed that center, moved the jobs over to the Philippines. And suddenly, these women who have families, have responsibilities, realize they only had high school diplomas and no way to make as much money as they had before. So they used a federal program called the Trade Adjustment Assistance program. It pays for two years of retraining to workers whose jobs have been lost to trade. And they went back to school, became respiratory techs. They're making about as much now as they did before, and they're both a lot more satisfied with their work. So they're kind of - they're how trade is supposed to work - you know, these low-skill, low-paying jobs move overseas. They're replaced by higher-skill, higher-wage jobs. And in an ideal system, the same people get trained for those new jobs. What I found though is that very few people actually get to take advantage of this retraining opportunity. MARTIN: Marilyn, is this an issue where you stand depends on where you sit because you're in an area where your livelihood depends on trade, then you tend to be for it, but if you're in an area where you think that you've been harmed by it, you tend to be against it? Or. . . GEEWAX: Well. . . MARTIN: . . . Is that not so much the case anymore? GEEWAX: Economists will say that generally speaking, there's something like a ratio of 16 to 1 of benefits to losses to trade. They find the data shows that ultimately it's good. But as I say, if you were that Carrier worker who just found out your job's going to Mexico, it's pretty tough to sit there, you know, thumbing through some academic studies saying that somebody else is winning when you know you're losing. And one other thing I just want to point out is that going forward, these deals are not going to be that much about manufacturing because that's sort of in the rearview mirror. We have lost a lot of manufacturing jobs already. What's happening in the future is how do these trade deals affect things like intellectual property, pharmaceuticals, much more sophisticated products. MARTIN: That's NPR's Marilyn Geewax and also with us Megan Verlee from Colorado Public Radio. Thank you both so much. GEEWAX: Oh, you're welcome. VERLEE: Thank you.

The intense downside of trade is felt very much by people, and it makes it easy to point to examples like that if you're a political candidate. The thing that's tricky about trade is that this is a very large economy. It's almost a $19 trillion economy with 323 million people. A lot happens at once. The gains can be very diffused and they're spread out over the economy. For example, air conditioning is really cheap now. A lot of that is because of overseas production. MARTIN: You know, it's interesting because when a lot of our reporters, as we mentioned, across the country have been digging into this over the course of the week, they experienced that kind of mixed bag of opinion themselves. For example, in Los Angeles, Saul Gonzales from member station KCRW talked with truck drivers in California. They're delivering goods from one of the busiest ports in the U. S. Here's Brian Spencer making the case for how trade helps him personally. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST) BRIAN SPENCER: How I pay my bills, how I take care of my family, etc. , etc. , is for the simple source of our trade system. You know, if nothing's coming and going, I'm sitting still, therefore I'm not making any money. I'm not making - you know, so I can't live. MARTIN: And here's another trucker Dennis Roach, who had a different opinion, less of a fan. Here it is. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST) DENNIS ROACH: Jobs are going to foreign countries. We're shipping more product in from overseas. You know, I'd bet you go to anybody's house and look in their closet and it says Indonesia, China, Japan, Taiwan. There's very few things that'll say made in the U. S. A. MARTIN: Let's go to Megan Verlee now. You had a piece that ran on member station Colorado Public Radio. Tell us a little bit about it. Well, let's play it a bit from the piece then Megan you can tell us more. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST) VERLEE: It's a quintessential Colorado scene. Grant Bledsoe's family has owned this Yuma County operation since the 1940's. This is what hungry calves sound like? GRANT BLEDSOE: They're just getting ready to go to grass for the summer time. VERLEE: These steers will eventually be going a lot further than that, or at least parts of them will. BLEDSOE: It's just amazing some of the products that get sold around the world, big demand for the diaphragm, the stomach, tripe to Mexico. MARTIN: So Megan, tell us a little bit more about your reporting. What were the opinions of the people that you interviewed? VERLEE: Well, like you've been saying, mixed from, you know, very traditional industries like beef production, which was shaped by NAFTA opening markets and now stands to really expand under the TPP into more Asian markets. On the one hand, we have people for whom the breaking down the barriers through trade deals is going to be a big plus. And I talked to workers who've been displaced because I think probably anywhere in the country you can find people who know that their jobs have moved overseas. MARTIN: You met two women at Starbucks, for example. You want to tell us about that? VERLEE: Yes. Venice Romero and Vanessa Abdurahman are really good friends. They met working at a T-Mobile call center, and they worked at that call center for more than a decade. And then a couple years ago, T-Mobile closed that center, moved the jobs over to the Philippines. And suddenly, these women who have families, have responsibilities, realize they only had high school diplomas and no way to make as much money as they had before. So they used a federal program called the Trade Adjustment Assistance program. It pays for two years of retraining to workers whose jobs have been lost to trade. And they went back to school, became respiratory techs. They're making about as much now as they did before, and they're both a lot more satisfied with their work. So they're kind of - they're how trade is supposed to work - you know, these low-skill, low-paying jobs move overseas. They're replaced by higher-skill, higher-wage jobs. And in an ideal system, the same people get trained for those new jobs. What I found though is that very few people actually get to take advantage of this retraining opportunity. MARTIN: Marilyn, is this an issue where you stand depends on where you sit because you're in an area where your livelihood depends on trade, then you tend to be for it, but if you're in an area where you think that you've been harmed by it, you tend to be against it? Or. . . GEEWAX: Well. . . MARTIN: . . . Is that not so much the case anymore? GEEWAX: Economists will say that generally speaking, there's something like a ratio of 16 to 1 of benefits to losses to trade. They find the data shows that ultimately it's good. But as I say, if you were that Carrier worker who just found out your job's going to Mexico, it's pretty tough to sit there, you know, thumbing through some academic studies saying that somebody else is winning when you know you're losing. And one other thing I just want to point out is that going forward, these deals are not going to be that much about manufacturing because that's sort of in the rearview mirror. We have lost a lot of manufacturing jobs already. What's happening in the future is how do these trade deals affect things like intellectual property, pharmaceuticals, much more sophisticated products. MARTIN: That's NPR's Marilyn Geewax and also with us Megan Verlee from Colorado Public Radio. Thank you both so much. GEEWAX: Oh, you're welcome.

It was the first to fall to ISIS two years ago. And it remains under the group's control. Now it's besieged by Iraqi forces, and residents are starving. According to Human Rights Watch, ISIS does not allow anyone to use their phones in Fallujah to communicate with the outside world. One exception is a local cleric. His name is Shaikh Mustafa Al-Tarabuli. He has been granted permission by ISIS leaders to negotiate with the Iraqi government to get food and medicine into the city. And he agreed to speak with us. Our producer, Noor Wazwaz, interpreted. NOOR WAZWAZ, BYLINE: (Foreign language spoken). GARCIA-NAVARRO: Al-Tarabuli says life has become almost unendurable. Iraqi military gains have intensified the siege over the last four months. MUSTAFA AL-TARABULI: (Through interpreter) Today someone died because all the medicine has expired. Basic foods like flour, rice, and cooking oil, have all run out. We're only eating things that we can grow, like vegetables. Electricity is gone, and gas has run out. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Fallujah has been at the center of conflict since the U. S. Invasion of Iraq in 2003. It was a scene of several huge battles between insurgents and the U. S. Military. I asked him how that period compares to what they're dealing with now. AL-TARABULI: (Through interpreter) There's no comparison. Now it is worse. When America was here, there was electricity and water. Now there is not. The children can't sleep because of hunger and the heat. They stay up until the morning. We don't sleep. GARCIA-NAVARRO: With ISIS in the city and the Iraqi army massed around it, Al-Tarabuli says the people worry the situation will get even more violent. He says there's only been limited resistance to ISIS inside Fallujah, and that has led to a perception by the Shiite-led government that all the Sunni residents are ISIS supporters. WAZWAZ: (Through interpreter) The government considers whoever stays in Fallujah part of ISIS. And because of that, they are bombing without purpose. They're bombing houses, markets, hospitals. GARCIA-NAVARRO: While many residents have fled, many thousands remain trapped inside the city. ISIS refuses to allow anyone to leave. And residents worry if they escape, they will be arrested by government troops as ISIS collaborators. As the imam of one of Fallujah's largest mosques, Al-Tarabuli was only recently permitted by ISIS to negotiate on behalf of the city to get the desperately needed supplies. But he says so far he hasn't made any progress. AL-TARABULI: (Through interpreter) Those who weren't killed by bombs, they're going to die from starvation. Those who don't die from starvation will die from lack of medicine. GARCIA-NAVARRO: He says people come to his mosque asking for food and for money, but he can't help them. So when he delivers the Friday sermon, he urges the rich to give to the poor. He says he doesn't think people can hold out for more than a few more months.

But the estimates are somewhere between 30 and 60,000 people. A huge amount of people have fled over the last two years. It used to be a city with a population of about 300,000. INSKEEP: Now, is that an accurate description we just heard of Iraqi government tactics? Because it was alleged there that the government assumes that anybody still left in Fallujah is a member of ISIS and therefore a fair target. MORRIS: I think to a certain extent, there's been a lot of criticism of the indiscriminate airstrikes and shelling on the city, a lot of reports of civilian casualties. There is an attitude within other parts of Iraq that Fallujahns are sympathetic to ISIS and their causes. That is a problem for sure. And when it comes to government tactics, the city has been cordoned off and slowly sort of choked off for months and months now. INSKEEP: Why is the government taking this approach of a siege? MORRIS: Well, Fallujah is pretty close to Baghdad. They want to isolate it but haven't been able to go in and take it. I mean, I think their tactic is choke them off. INSKEEP: I'm reminded that U. S. Forces went in to take Fallujah once upon a time, and it was brutal house-to-house combat. I suppose we're hearing the result when Iraqi forces decide not to do that and simply stand off and bomb the place. MORRIS: Right. I mean, there's a debate in Iraq at the moment whether to go into Fallujah or whether to leave it until after a Mosul offensive. There's quite a push, definitely among the local counsel in Anbar, to have an operation for Fallujah soon because they think that would help the humanitarian situation in a way. But there needs to be an end to this siege and and end to ISIS rule. INSKEEP: Is there a history of trouble between Fallujah and the broader national government? MORRIS: Absolutely. I mean, Fallujah for a long time has been known as a city that's a very difficult to control. Even in the Saddam era, Saddam had problems controlling the tribes there. So post-2003, people felt very disenfranchised. And Fallujah is a largely Sunni town. The government in Baghdad is Shia-led. Fallujah was one place where post-2003 al-Qaida really gained - gained a foothold. Then under Nouri al-Maliki the relationship was again problematic. You had big protests in Fallujah among the Sunnis in the year leading up to ISIS taking over. So yeah, it's not an easy relationship. INSKEEP: How has the government done more broadly - this Shia-dominated government - at reassuring Sunnis that it's on their side? MORRIS: So when Abadi's new government came in, there were a lot of promises to the Sunnis when it came to including them in government and also reforming some laws in Iraq, which have really been perceived and used to persecute Sunnis. There are anti-terrorism laws that have been used arbitrarily for arrests. Some of the demands of Sunnis initially when coming into government - into the coalition government - were that some of these things would be changed. And there's really been no change on that. Now, on top of all that, we've got death and war. It's really not an easy time for Sunnis in Iraq. INSKEEP: Loveday Morris of The Washington Post in Baghdad, thanks very much. MORRIS: Thank you.

Our own Peter Breslow followed them on a training ride outside of Kabul. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)ABDUL SADIQ: (Through interpreter) The road is very narrow. Make sure you don't get into an accident. As you see, the cars are coming. (SOUNDBITE OF CAR HORN)PETER BRESLOW, BYLINE: Just west of Kabul where the city's sooty skies give way to fresher air, coach Abdul Sadiq cautions the four young women of the Afghan National Cycling Federation. Today, they're working on their riding technique while dodging the free-form traffic. SADIQ: (Through interpreter) There has to be a space. Adjust the space. (SOUNDBITE OF CAR HORN)UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: (Through interpreter) Of course it's dangerous. Every time we hear a car coming, we kind of look twice and then get to the side to avoid an accident. SIMON: So in that story, we heard about a dedicated coach and his proud, fierce riders. But now that hopeful story's turned sour. Abdul Sadiq has been dismissed as men's coach and head of the Afghan Cycling Federation amid questions about corruption and his relationship with some of the women riders. And Mountain2Mountain, the charity that supplied bikes and gear to the riders, announced that it will no longer support the cycling federation. Shannon Galpin is the founder of Mountain2Mountain. She joins us on the line from Breckenridge, Colo. Thanks so much for being with us. SHANNON GALPIN: Thanks for having me. SIMON: And why have you withdrawn your support? GALPIN: Oh, well because they have been selling the bikes that we've donated. They embezzle money. The corruption was just too much. I couldn't navigate the corruption, you know, one more day. SIMON: Now, coach Sadiq has been fired from the cycling federation and the men's team. But - do I have this correct? - he still coaches the women. GALPIN: He is still the coach for the women - for the moment. SIMON: Yeah. This has to be bad for team morale. GALPIN: Well, I think it's bad for all teams in Afghanistan because this is not just indicative of, you know, the cycling federation. I mean, this is a problem that we have been working with for the past three years. This is not new for us. And it's not new for the other sports federations - the cricket, the soccer, the taekwondo teams. All of the women's sports federations, you know, unfortunately are subject to the same corruption and mismanagement because the men are in the positions of power. So even something as empowering as sport - and in this particular case, our work with the cycling team, it just becomes another source of oppression and entrapment. SIMON: I don't want to make apologies for corruption. Maybe it's the Chicagoan in me. GALPIN: (Laughter). SIMON: But is it possible that you're just not understanding Afghanistan culture? GALPIN: No because I've worked in Afghanistan for eight years. I'm very aware of every layer of corruption and how systemic it is and how it's literally part of daily life. I am not naive about that. And in this particular case, it is a system where we bring over materials and supplies for the girls, and the coach sells them for his own benefit. This last February, the coach took the girls to India to race at the South Asian championships. And I had funded this race. They were representing their country, and he didn't take them to the races. He took them to India and took them to go see his family. So you know, there's nothing open to interpretation, nor is selling the bikes that have been donated for the girls to race and ride on. SIMON: Yeah. The New York Times reports that Mr. Sadiq denied all corruption charges. We have been unsuccessful in reaching Mr. Sadiq ourselves so far, but we'll continue to try to do that. You're headed back to Afghanistan next week, though, to work with the women, right? GALPIN: I am. SIMON: You might run into coach Sadiq. GALPIN: Oh, I plan to (laughter). I'm not avoiding him. You know, this is just the next step in what has been a, you know, a long road over the last three years to support these young women who - here they are having all these barriers of, you know, a very conservative society. Bicycling is still taboo for women. And yet, the same institutions that are there to support cycling and to support sports are the same institutions that are creating the barriers. The girls are scared to say anything publicly because they would lose their right to ride. And that means way too much to them. It's - they don't see another avenue. And so unless there is another solution, whether that is a change in leadership or whether that is bringing them outside of the country to be able to get real coaching and training, it remains kind of a helpless place for them.

This week, airstrikes in Aleppo hit a hospital run by Doctors Without Borders. The group says the bombs killed at least 50 people, including medical staff, one of whom was the last pediatrician in Aleppo. Other airstrikes killed more than a hundred other people in Aleppo this week. The hospital had an emergency room, an operating room and an intensive care unit, which means more people may die in the weeks ahead because local medical care has been obliterated. The hospital was in an area of town held by rebels, whom the Assad regime is relentlessly attacking. It is estimated that at least a quarter million people have been killed in the five years of the Syrian civil war that began as an uprising against Bashar al-Assad. The U. N. says about six and a half million Syrians have been displaced from their homes. The country's economy has collapsed, along with most schools, health care and culture. More than 4. 8 million Syrians are refugees, many stewing in vast teeming camps in Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq, the islands of Greece and other parts of Europe.

From Tiananmen in China to the Piazza Navona in Italy, public squares can be one of the most beloved parts of city life. After visiting Italy some years ago, writer Catie Marron began thinking about the different roles of public squares as, say, tourist hubs or protest settings. Marron asked well-known writers to share their thoughts about famous squares around the world, gathering their essays in a new book \"City Squares. \" NPR's Lynn Neary talked to some of those writers. LYNN NEARY, BYLINE: A public square, says Michael Kimmelman, doesn't have to be square. MICHAEL KIMMELMAN: Some squares are actually square, but most of them aren't. NEARY: What's important, Kimmelman says, is that a square draws people into it like a magnet because unlike a park, where people go to retreat, a square is all about mingling with a crowd. It is, says Kimmelman, like a living organism in the heart of a city. KIMMELMAN: For me, a square is about a notion that we have of what an urban life can be and why we go to cities, what we look for in cities. And it has to do with a sense of community, a sense of shared values, a sense of creative possibilities, a sense of humanity. NEARY: Kimmelman is the architecture critic for The New York Times. But he says the building that surround a square really aren't that important. Look at the squares of Rome, he says. KIMMELMAN: There's the Piazza Navona, an incredibly beautiful square with these great buildings by Borromini and sculptures by Bernini. But just a block or so away is the Campo de' Fiori. And there's really nothing particularly distinguished about the buildings that surround that square but it's a hub of life, and it speaks as much to what makes Rome a beautiful city and why people love it, as does the Piazza Navona. NEARY: Those Roman squares are places where people gather for pleasure - to shop at vegetable and flower stores, to eat at nearby restaurants, to sit on the side of a fountain and talk with a friend. Other squares are not so peaceful. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: On the streets leading down to the main road to Tiananmen Square, furious people stared in disbelief at the glow in the sky, listening to the sound of shots. NEARY: On June 4, 1989, Chinese troops opened fire and demonstrators gathered in Tiananmen Square in Beijing. Seven years later, when New Yorker writer Evan Osnos went to China for the first time as a student, he headed straight to Tiananmen Square. EVAN OSNOS: In some ways for me it was almost inescapable. That was the only place I could go first. I had to go to Tiananmen Square if I wanted to understand what China was and where it was trying to go. NEARY: But Osnos was disappointed by what he found. China's government had thoroughly reclaimed the space once occupied by protesters. OSNOS: Remember, at one point there were a million people in the streets of Beijing, in and around Tiananmen Square. But then when I came to the place itself, any trace of those events had really been erased to the point that in fact, the government had taken away whatever benches or shade trees there used to be around the edge because they really didn't want people collecting in Tiananmen Square anymore. And so there was a strange emptiness about it. NEARY: Tiananmen, Osnos discovered, could not tell him where China would be going. It was forever linked to the past, to an event people still talk about in whispers and that the government still wants its citizens to forget. But the square itself remains a constant reminder of what happened there. CATIE MARRON: Squares retain their history. They really can't escape that. NEARY: Catie Marron is the editor of CitySquares. In recent years, Marron says, social movements have gotten their start on the Internet - the virtual square. But they quickly moved out into the streets. MARRON: Social media announced what was going on. It brought people to the square, it gave people information. But where people made their protests, where they made their voices heard, was not on the Internet. It was in the physical square. NEARY: Social media spread the word about the anti-government demonstration in Cairo's Tahrir Square in 2011. But when the government blocked Facebook and Twitter, says Jehane Noujaim, even more people came to the square to find out what was happening. Noujaim made an Oscar-nominated documentary about the protest called \"The Square. \"JEHANE NOUJAIM: I grew up 10 minutes away from the square, and I had never experienced Egypt in the same way that I did when I went to that square. (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"THE SQUARE\")UNIDENTIFIED CROWD: (Chanting in Arabic). NOUJAIM: You had people chanting around you saying, hold your head up high, you're Egyptian. And it had this kind of spontaneous energy to it where people would come - come with a tent, come with a blanket - join. And you didn't know how long it would last. NEARY: That energy has given way to harsh political realities in Egypt. Tahrir Square is still meaningful to her, says Noujaim, but now it's a beautifully manicured sterile space. And if there's one thing that the writers in this book make clear, it's that squares are always changing, like the people who inhabit them. Lynn Neary, NPR News, Washington.

It was forever linked to the past, to an event people still talk about in whispers and that the government still wants its citizens to forget. But the square itself remains a constant reminder of what happened there. CATIE MARRON: Squares retain their history. They really can't escape that. NEARY: Catie Marron is the editor of CitySquares. In recent years, Marron says, social movements have gotten their start on the Internet - the virtual square. But they quickly moved out into the streets. MARRON: Social media announced what was going on. It brought people to the square, it gave people information. But where people made their protests, where they made their voices heard, was not on the Internet. It was in the physical square. NEARY: Social media spread the word about the anti-government demonstration in Cairo's Tahrir Square in 2011. But when the government blocked Facebook and Twitter, says Jehane Noujaim, even more people came to the square to find out what was happening. Noujaim made an Oscar-nominated documentary about the protest called \"The Square. \" JEHANE NOUJAIM: I grew up 10 minutes away from the square, and I had never experienced Egypt in the same way that I did when I went to that square. (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"THE SQUARE\") UNIDENTIFIED CROWD: (Chanting in Arabic). NOUJAIM: You had people chanting around you saying, hold your head up high, you're Egyptian. And it had this kind of spontaneous energy to it where people would come - come with a tent, come with a blanket - join. And you didn't know how long it would last. NEARY: That energy has given way to harsh political realities in Egypt. Tahrir Square is still meaningful to her, says Noujaim, but now it's a beautifully manicured sterile space. And if there's one thing that the writers in this book make clear, it's that squares are always changing, like the people who inhabit them.

Ahmed, welcome. Thank you for joining us. AHMED MAHER: My pleasure. MARTIN: Can you describe the scene there now and what happened overnight? MAHER: Yeah, it's a very dramatic development because the protestors decided to pull out from the Green Zone. And the Green Zone, it's home to the foreign embassies, the cabinet, the parliament. So they decided to pull out at a request from the influential Shia cleric Muqtada al-Sadr. And they are giving the politicians another chance to meet this month for - not just for changing the faces of the new ministers, but they need to feel great improvement, especially at the economic level. Otherwise, they threatened that they will come back to the Green Zone to stage an open sit-in. And also, they threatened to topple the three presidencies. I mean here the president of the republic, the prime minister and the speaker of Parliament. MARTIN: Why is breaching the Green Zone so significant? MAHER: Well, it is very significant because this is the seat of power in Iraq. By occupying it briefly by the protestors, they wanted to send a strong message - a message to the government, to the MPs and the outside world that they are now dictating the political landscape in Iraq. MARTIN: Now you mentioned that the cleric Muqtada al-Sadr ordered or suggested that the protesters leave the area. Did he organize this protest to begin with? MAHER: Well, I mean, just one word from Mr. Sadr is enough to amass hundreds of thousands. This guy is massively popular among Iraqis because many of them, especially the Shia and even the Sunni now, they see him as a symbol of resistance against the American invasions and occupation of Iraq in 2003. So Mr. Sadr held a press conference because he was frustrated. He was angry, and he expressed his anger at the politicians. And straightaway, immediately after he finished his press conference based on the Green Zone and of course the army - and the security forces didn't do anything because he wanted to avoid any bloodshed. MARTIN: Is what happened in the Green Zone seen to have damaged the standing of the prime minister? MAHER: Well, I think he might be seen in the West now as a weak prime minister because they are pinning high hopes on a strong, stable government here in Iraq. And that's why Mr. Joe Biden came all the way in an unannounced visit, to support Mr. Abadi. But now, what happened yesterday, it was quite an embarrassment to Mr. Abadi himself.

That's the secure center of government where Parliament and foreign embassies are located. Demonstrators breached the barricades, terrifying legislators. Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, like the majority of Iraqis, is a Shiite. He's supported at least tacitly by cleric Muqtada al-Sadr. Sadr is massively popular with poor Shiites. But Abadi is not moving fast enough for people on the streets, and we'll hear what these protests mean for the U. S. But first, Loveday Morris is the Baghdad bureau chief for The Washington Post. We asked her who it was that overran security at the Green Zone Saturday. LOVEDAY MORRIS: The protesters were largely followers of Muqtada al-Sadr, who is a powerful Shiite cleric here in Iraq. He notoriously fought the U. S. occupation in Iraq. More recently he's been positioning himself as a real crusader for reform in Iraq, and he's been calling his followers out on the street. He's been calling for a technocratic government and an end to this sectarian quota system in Iraq which was actually introduced after 2003. And it means that political positions in Iraq are really divvied up based on sex and ethnicity. CORNISH: And this is important especially when it comes to Parliament - right? - 'cause Parliament has been slow to make changes. MORRIS: Right. Well, this is part of the problem, really. Abadi, the prime minister - he actually originally suggested bringing in this technocratic government. It's something that he wanted to do, but he's really been unable to push that through Parliament. We've had chaotic scenes in Parliament. People have ended up in scuffles. And in the street, they're watching this from outside and getting very impatient. They want to see changes, but the political system is so broken that the prime minister is unable to meet that demand. CORNISH: Now I understand this protest was mainly peaceful. Can you describe what the scene was like? MORRIS: Sure. I mean Sadr actually gave a speech, and then moments afterwards, you had this mass of people push into the Green Zone through the security barriers. It seems that the security forces were just overwhelmed. But largely they were allowed, really, to push through the security cordons. They did, you know, ransack Parliament. This is what they - this is a symbol of the corrupt politicians in Iraq. People are very frustrated. CORNISH: The backdrop to all of this that you've written about is that essentially Iraq is broke with declining oil revenues. How does that contribute to this instability? MORRIS: Right. Well, this is another huge issue for Iraq. And it's one of the reasons that Abadi, the prime minister, is so desperate to actually enact reform in Iraq - because Iraq spends 4 billion a month on government salaries but because of the plunge in oil prices is only bringing in about 2 billion a month in revenue. And people are worried about the effect of that when it comes to paying salaries for soldiers. People are worried about that when it comes to paying salaries for government workers. And if the government can't pay salaries, there's a potential for huge unrest. CORNISH: In the meantime, what is about to happen next? The sit in is over. Does this mean there's going to be any movement in the Parliament? MORRIS: The protests have essentially taken a pause. Sadr's gone off to Iran today. Presumably they're trying to play some kind of mediation role. But what everyone is waiting to see is whether Haider Abadi can meet the demands of the protesters. People don't even think that he can get enough MPs to Parliament to vote. And if he does, there's a huge amount of anger and frustration with Haider al-Abadi at the moment. People blame him for the storming of the Green Zone, so even if he gets Parliament together to sit, whether they'll vote for his reforms at this point is in doubt. CORNISH: That's Loveday Morris.

That's because firefighters there are unable to control a wildfire that has reached the city limits. It's destroyed several residential neighborhoods. And we're joined now on the line by CBC reporter Marion Warnica. She's at an evacuation center outside of the town of Fort McMurray. Thanks for being with us, Marion. MARION WARNICA: You're welcome. MARTIN: Can you describe, first of all, just the severity of this blaze? WARNICA: Well, it's being called the largest wildfire evacuation in Alberta history. That's even more severe than the large wildfire in Slave Lake that basically destroyed that town about five years ago. So it's causing huge concern. We can say this morning that we know hundreds of homes have burned. We don't know exactly how many. They're still assessing the damage. Police crews are still going through the town itself, which is under a mandatory evacuation order. They're going through street by street, home by home making sure that nobody is still there because yesterday, we saw this flare up really quickly with hot temperatures and winds. And they're looking at expecting similar weather again today, really hot scorching temperatures and gusting winds. So at a press conference late last night, the fire chief actually said we haven't seen the worst yet. The worst is not over yet. So that's how severe it is right now. MARTIN: We mentioned you're at an evacuation center outside of the town. Can you just describe that scene? I mean, where have people been evacuated to? And what, if anything, have they been able to take with them? WARNICA: Some people were able to take very, very little. And some people had just minutes to spare to pack up because, as I mentioned, it just really escalated. It was like a switch. So for a couple of hours, it went from, you know, we're cautiously watching this, sort of be ready, but you don't have to leave yet, to, like, you need to pack your things and go. So I talked to a few people here. There's a group of seniors who were in the cafeteria here just sitting in these hard straight-backed chairs for a few hours waiting for beds in this evacuation center. They had spent five hours on a bus just to drive 20 kilometers to this spot out of town. Not a long stretch of road by any means. But because of the gridlock, all the people trying to get out, that's how long it took them. And they came from right downtown, which is one of the hot spots of this fire, so really harrowing experience for lots of people. We're seeing young families too. I'm hearing word that were actually a couple of babies born in this evacuation center last night. MARTIN: Wow. WARNICA: So it's a busy and tense scene here. MARTIN: And it's my understanding that this blaze is happening up in a part of Alberta where there are oil sands nearby. How is that complicating the firefighting effort? WARNICA: Well, it's definitely impacting what is known as the economic driver of this province. The oil sites are being shut down. We're hearing that they're evacuating all nonessential workers. And that's mainly to make room in these oil sand camps for evacuees from Fort McMurray, who are coming out here and need a place to stay. So they're shutting down these camps. And they're keeping a very watchful eye on that place, which, as we've mentioned, is expected to grow throughout the day today. MARTIN: CBC reporter Marion Warnica, thanks so much.

And what, if anything, have they been able to take with them? WARNICA: Some people were able to take very, very little. And some people had just minutes to spare to pack up because, as I mentioned, it just really escalated. It was like a switch. So for a couple of hours, it went from, you know, we're cautiously watching this, sort of be ready, but you don't have to leave yet, to, like, you need to pack your things and go. So I talked to a few people here. There's a group of seniors who were in the cafeteria here just sitting in these hard straight-backed chairs for a few hours waiting for beds in this evacuation center. They had spent five hours on a bus just to drive 20 kilometers to this spot out of town. Not a long stretch of road by any means. But because of the gridlock, all the people trying to get out, that's how long it took them. And they came from right downtown, which is one of the hot spots of this fire, so really harrowing experience for lots of people. We're seeing young families too. I'm hearing word that were actually a couple of babies born in this evacuation center last night. MARTIN: Wow. WARNICA: So it's a busy and tense scene here. MARTIN: And it's my understanding that this blaze is happening up in a part of Alberta where there are oil sands nearby. How is that complicating the firefighting effort? WARNICA: Well, it's definitely impacting what is known as the economic driver of this province. The oil sites are being shut down. We're hearing that they're evacuating all nonessential workers. And that's mainly to make room in these oil sand camps for evacuees from Fort McMurray, who are coming out here and need a place to stay. So they're shutting down these camps. And they're keeping a very watchful eye on that place, which, as we've mentioned, is expected to grow throughout the day today. MARTIN: CBC reporter Marion Warnica, thanks so much.

Around 90,000 residents have fled Fort McMurray and nearby communities. The fire has also led oil companies to suspend production in the area. Joining us to talk about all of this is Evan Dyer, a reporter with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. Thanks for joining us. EVAN DYER: Sure, pleasure. SIEGEL: And tell us first, where are you and what are you hearing from evacuees? DYER: I'm in a town called Lac la Biche, which is immediately south of the fire area. And this is an area that a lot of evacuees are coming to or through. It's really a small town, and it's unable to host the kinds of numbers that we're seeing fleeing the fire zone because Fort McMurray is really alone in this part of the country. It's a big town built on oil. There's no other big towns around it for people to go to, so most evacuees are having to head on to points further south. But, you know, we've heard stories of people fleeing through hundred-foot-tall flames on both sides of the road with embers falling all around them. I spoke to a couple who made that trip with a just newborn premature baby just about an hour ago. And you can imagine that many people who fled don't know what they've left behind. They don't know if their homes are still standing. We've also seen people who know their homes are gone. I even spoke to a man who was told last night his home was gone, and then he learned this morning that it actually is still standing. So there's all kinds of emotions and all kinds of, you know, good and bad news coming out of the fire zone. SIEGEL: We've heard this described as the biggest evacuation in the history of Alberta Province. Do you get that sense of the scale of it as it's happening? DYER: Oh, absolutely, I mean, you know, a large number of people when they fled For McMurray, went to the north. The majority went south. The ones who went north, though, went north on the only north-south highway - the only highway that goes through town, Highway 63 - and were then cut off on the other side of Fort McMurray away from help. And so, you know, there were 25,000 people stranded up there. And there's been an enormous effort to fly them out. Several thousand came out that way. But today, the Mounties tried to organize a convoy where those people would drive in a convoy about 1,500 vehicles back through the fire zone right through Fort McMurray and head to the south. But what we're hearing is that that convoy has, again, run into some very, very serious fire on both sides of the highway, flames 200 feet high in some cases. SIEGEL: Wow. Now, I understand that the oil facilities are not in the fire's direct path. But how have they actually been affected by this? DYER: Well, in a number of ways. One way is simply the lack of labor because, of course, the labor force lives mostly in Fort McMurray, which has been entirely evacuated. So that's the first impact on the oil industry. Many people were already in the camps. These are typically camps where you fly in or drive in for two weeks and then come out for a week. But even there, many have been shut down or slowed down because, first of all, the oil that comes out of here has to be diluted. There are pipelines that bring diluents in and then another pipeline that would bring the oil out. Both kinds of pipelines are at risk in some areas and have had to be shut down in a sort of preventative fashion. And then there are fires blowing quite close to some big oilfields to the northeast of the city right now. And they've also been shut down as a safety measure. There's no significant damage yet to oil facilities, but there is a pretty significant drop in production. SIEGEL: And just very, very briefly, do officials think they can get this wildfire under control anytime soon? DYER: Not without help from the weather, no, because the fire is just too big. There's over 140 aircraft fighting this fire. But there's - nobody's under any illusion that people are going to stop this fire. We need a change in the weather.

That's the attack that killed 298 people in the skies over eastern Ukraine nearly two years ago. Russian officials are trying to discredit a new report that implicates the Russian military. NPR's Corey Flintoff reports from Moscow. COREY FLINTOFF, BYLINE: The latest report comes from a U. K. -based organization called Bellingcat which bills itself as a group of citizen investigative journalists. Much of their work is done by volunteers who sift through open-source information on the web, including social media and satellite imagery. Bellingcat is focused on a number of big stories such as the war in Syria and the terror attacks in Paris. The group was launched with a crowdfunding campaign and says it now receives a grant from Google. The Bellingcat team has been interested in the MH17 case ever since the plane was shot down in July of 2014. Early on, the group found photographs of an anti-aircraft missile launcher that were taken in eastern Ukraine on the day the plane was shot down. Eliot Higgins, one of the founders of Bellingcat, says his group linked the missile launcher, called a Buk, to the Russian 53rd Air Defense Brigade. That unit is stationed in the Russian city of Kursk, not far from the Ukrainian border. ELIOT HIGGINS: We discovered quite quickly that the soldiers there were using a lot of social media, posting photographs of each other - photographs from the base. FLINTOFF: The photographs included pictures of their equipment including their Buk missile launchers. The launcher that was believed to have shot down the Malaysian airliner had an identification number that was partly worn away, but the researchers were able to pick out other unique characteristics. They included a dent in the side of the launcher and even the pattern formed by soot around the exhaust pipe. HIGGINS: So we looked at all these details and we were able to establish the number of the missile launcher which was 332. FLINTOFF: In other words, Bellingcat is saying that MH17 was shot down by a specific Russian missile launcher that was documented to be in eastern Ukraine at the time. The spokesperson for the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Maria Zakharova, dismissed the Bellingcat report. She says it was the work of amateurs who ignored the information put forward by Russian experts and professionals. And she says the motives behind it are sinister. MARIA ZAKHAROVA: (Speaking Russian). FLINTOFF: She says, \"we consider this whole campaign to be an attempt by certain destructive forces to demonize Russia by creating an image in the mass consciousness that's very far from reality. \" Eliot Higgins says much of the information provided by the Russian experts has been refuted. He says there's a simple reason that Russia's been so adamant about rejecting any suggestion that its troops were involved in the shoot-down. Russia has continually denied that it ever sent any troops or equipment across the border into Ukraine. HIGGINS: So to admit that they were responsible for MH17 is not only, you know, admitting to the murder of 298 people but also admitting that they were lying for months and months to their own country people. FLINTOFF: The Safety Board in the Netherlands, where the flight originated, recently completed its investigation saying the plane was most likely shot down by a Buk missile originating from territory controlled by the Russian-backed separatists. Dutch police are now conducting a criminal investigation into the attack which may finally conclude who fired the missile. Corey Flintoff, NPR News, Moscow.

S. envoy on climate change where the challenge is biggest, Todd Stern told me one country now has a steeper hill to climb than any other. TODD STERN: There's no country probably with a bigger challenge looking at the number of people, the level of their economic growth, the number of people who don't have access to electricity. SHAPIRO: Want to guess which country he's talking about? Here's a clue - sounds from a market in one of this country's biggest cities. (CROSSTALK)SHAPIRO: So which country is this? ANJALI JAISWAL: India has a lot of challenges and a lot of opportunities. SHAPIRO: That's Anjali Jaiswal from the Natural Resources Defense Council. JAISWAL: What's happening in India is really transformational. It's unprecedented. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: We would like to be the first to welcome you to New Delhi, India. SHAPIRO: To see this transformation up close, a producer, a photographer and I flew to the biggest democracy in the world. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: So we do ask that you please remain comfortably seated. SHAPIRO: We've brought back stories looking at some of the ways people are managing the tension between development and climate change. And today we want to answer a more basic question. Why India? When lots of developing countries are struggling with these challenges, what makes India unique, and what can it tell us about the challenges around climate change that the whole world faces? ANTHONY LEISEROWITZ: First and perhaps most importantly, India's now the third-largest emitter of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. SHAPIRO: This is Anthony Leiserowitz. He directs the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication. He says even though India is only behind the U. S. and China in total carbon emissions, it's just getting started. Per Capita emissions are still really low. Most people are poor and just don't have a big carbon footprint. LEISEROWITZ: Seventy-six percent of Indians live on less than $2 a day. I mean, Americans can't imagine living on $2 a day, and yet, 76 percent of this population which is right around a billion people right now are living on that kind of income. SHAPIRO: In India, 400 million people don't have reliable electricity. That's more than the entire population of the United States. And India has ambitious goals to give its people think that Americans take for granted like refrigerators or cars or even something as basic as lighting at night. AJAY MATHUR: This means that we need to enhance the energy supply by four to five times what it is now. SHAPIRO: Do you mean provide four to five times as much energy as India is creating right now? MATHUR: Right now. SHAPIRO: Wow. MATHUR: Right. SHAPIRO: This is Ajay Mathur. He is one of India's climate experts who now runs the Energy and Resources Institute in New Delhi. He told me no matter how fast India increases its clean energy like solar and wind, the country will not cut back on coal - in fact, quite the opposite. MATHUR: It will increase. But whereas the amount of coal that we use will probably double between now and 2030, the amount of renewables will probably go up by an order of 10. SHAPIRO: So here's the answer to that question, why India? If India can find a sustainable way to develop, that could be a template for the rest of the world. Every highly developed country in history has gotten where it is in an unsustainable way - by cutting down trees, pumping carbon into the atmosphere. And if the developing world today does the same thing, this could lead to disaster, and the impacts of climate change would hit people in India harder than almost anywhere else. RICHARD HEWSTON: India has the highest number of people exposed to natural hazards. SHAPIRO: Richard Hewston is with a global risk assessment firm call Verisk Maplecroft. His company looked at which countries around the world are most vulnerable to storms, flooding and other acts of nature, and India was at the top of the list - No. 1 in the world. HEWSTON: Tropical cyclones are likely to become more intense. We're also seeing that climate change is going to have an impact on the monsoon. SHAPIRO: That means more floods for some people in India and more droughts for others. To of India's biggest cities, New Delhi and Calcutta, are on the top 10 list of global cities most vulnerable to natural hazards. We will visit both Delhi and Calcutta over the next two weeks. And here are some of the people we'll meet. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: (Foreign language spoken). SHAPIRO: On a small island, a man whose home has already been washed away by rising tides.

He's in the city of Edmonton. It's about 270 miles south of the fire. And he has taken in a number of family members, also some animals. He is on the line. And, Mr. Fleming, good morning to you, sir. JOHN FLEMING: Good morning. GREENE: So I understand you have more than a dozen family members you've taken in, four dogs, a cat. What's the scene like right now in your home as you're bringing people out of harm's way? FLEMING: Absolutely, there is my five siblings and my dad who live in Fort McMurray. So our little family of my wife and I and our two kids are now 14 of us in not a big house, but we're a family. GREENE: When - and Fort McMurray, we should say, is where much of your family lives. I know you're from there. And it sounds like that city has really been hit in - just unimaginably hard in this. FLEMING: Yeah, it was really unbelievable. I was at my work, and within a couple hours in the afternoon, you started to see pictures and hear stories about a fire that was burning outside of town quickly turned its eyes on the city. And people were having helicopters fly over their homes. And my sister, who lost their home, had somebody outside of their house on a bullhorn yelling to her husband to leave. So he took their two dogs and just escaped with the clothes on their back. And just unbelievable that nobody was hurt or harmed. GREENE: It sounds like, fortunately, your sister, her family and all of your family members are OK, which must be just a huge relief. FLEMING: Absolutely, and we do what family members do. So we knew that they knew where to go. And we knew they were going to come. And now we're just working out where we're going to go from here. GREENE: Was your sister able to find out what happened to her home after she had fled and arrived in your place? FLEMING: I can tell you one thing that's been really, really cool is Google Earth's satellite overlay image came. An emergency Crisis Map was done and showed all of the structures that had burned. So that's how she first found out that she had lost her home. GREENE: And, Mr. Fleming, I gather you have a brother who is a firefighter who is still up in this area. What are you hearing from him? FLEMING: Yeah, he's right in the city. He hasn't been able to leave yet. So they're now just planning their shifts on how they're going to fly people back in and out because they've called this thing the beast - three times the size of Edmonton. And it certainly is going to be quite a while, like you've been hearing, before this thing is under control. So, yeah, they're remarkably heroic. GREENE: Well, Mr. Fleming, it's very good news that your family is all safe. And we'll be thinking the best for you and the family. Thanks so much for talking to us. FLEMING: Thank you.

A White House Announcement says it will come later this month when the president goes to Japan. In 1945, about 145,000 people died in Hiroshima after the U. S. dropped an atomic bomb on the city. And for more, NPR's Scott Horsley joins us now. Good morning. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Good morning, Renee. MONTAGNE: And the obvious question is why now? HORSLEY: Well, Obama's been saying for years, Renee, that he would like to visit Hiroshima ever since his first presidential trip to Japan back in 2009. And now he has the opportunity. He's traveling to Japan later this month for a summit meeting with other G-7 leaders. This is likely his last trip to Japan while he's in the White House, so it's sort of now or never. Reporters have been asking the White House for weeks if the President's trip would include a stop to Hiroshima. And officials had been noncommittal until this morning, when they announced that he would be going to a memorial park in the center of the city. And he'll give a speech there. I should say former President Jimmy Carter visited Hiroshima more than 30 years ago, but that was after he had left office. So obviously this trip will carry a lot more weight. MONTAGNE: And Scott, as visits go, this would be a sensitive one. I mean, no sitting president has taken on going to Hiroshima in all of these years. What about that? HORSLEY: That's right, Renee. There's always a question of what a visit like this would symbolize. Does a presidential trip to Hiroshima suggest an apology of some sort on behalf of the U. S. government? Keep in mind, this is a president who has wrongly been accused of conducting apology tours even when he does no such thing. So for Obama to travel to Hiroshima is particularly fraught. There's obviously a great deal of sensitivity both in Japan and here at home about what happened in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Hundreds of thousands of Japanese, as you said - mostly civilians - were killed. On the other hand, of course, those bombings hastened the end of a deadly and destructive war. By coincidence, the president's visit will come just before Memorial Day, when Obama plans to honor World War II veterans. For decades, U. S. officials avoided setting foot in Hiroshima, but there has been a change in recent years. And that sort of helped to pave the way for this visit. The last two U. S. ambassadors to Japan have gone, and Secretary of State John Kerry was there last month. Now, the White House is adamant President Obama's visit does not represent an apology for the bombings. And he won't revisit the decision to use the atomic weapons. Rather, this visit is meant to underscore his determination to prevent the use of nuclear weapons in the future. MONTAGNE: And just briefly, how is that effort going? HORSLEY: Well, it's a mixed record. The president's had some notable successes, including the Iran nuclear deal and arms control reduction treaty with Russia. But he's not been able to make additional progress with Vladimir Putin. And right in Japan's backyard, you have nuclear development proceeding in North Korea. So if ever there was a moment for a cautionary visit to Hiroshima, this might be it. MONTAGNE: Scott, thanks very much. HORSLEY: My pleasure, Renee. MONTAGNE: That's NPR's Scott Horsley.

In New Delhi, it can have the same impact on your lungs as chain smoking. India's capital has the worst air quality of any city in the world. And our colleague Ari Shapiro, the co-host of All Things Considered, recently went for an early morning run outdoors in New Delhi. And Ari's with us right now. Good morning. ARI SHAPIRO, BYLINE: Hi, Renee. MONTAGNE: And you have been in India for the last couple of weeks. SHAPIRO: Yeah, we divided our time one week in New Delhi and one week in this rural area called the Sundarbans. You're going to hear a lot more about both of those places over the next couple weeks. But we wanted to look broadly at tensions between climate change and development. So I went to Nehru Park in the center of Delhi with a triathlete who was training at dawn on a Sunday morning. His name is Sheeta Behel. He works at an investment firm. Let's listen. I'm sure I don't need to tell you, Delhi has the most polluted air of any city in the world. SHEETAL BAHL: (Unintelligible). There was a report, and one of the statistics published was that if you ran the half marathon in two hours, it was equivalent to smoking 80 to 100 cigarettes in that two hours. SHAPIRO: My word. BAHL: Yeah, and we're still running. SHAPIRO: You are still running. BAHL: (Coughing) We are. SHAPIRO: And coughing I hear. BAHL: And coughing, as you can see on the way. SHAPIRO: Isn't that, do you think, because of the pollution? BAHL: Yeah, you know, so the pollution is definitely a thing. And we can feel we slow down. We've been all a little ill one time or the other. You can see that much more with our kids. So my kid, for example, about a third of his class has to use nebulizers through half the winters. So it's pretty bad for kids at least. SHAPIRO: That must be really upsetting for you as a parent. BAHL: It is. SHAPIRO: It's one thing to make a decision as an adult for yourself. But. . . BAHL: Yeah, it is. You know, we've - for the first time in our lives this winter, we actively considered moving out of the city. And my wife and I have lived in Delhi all our lives. SHAPIRO: Just because of the pollution? BAHL: Just because of the pollution, yeah. SHAPIRO: A lot of people train for a triathlon in order to make themselves healthier. But it seems that in Delhi. . . BAHL: Yeah, whether you're getting - whether you're better off or worse off. SHAPIRO: Do you think you're making the right choice? BAHL: I'm not sure at all. To be honest, it sounds completely asinine, the choice we're making. (LAUGHTER)BAHL: So. . . SHAPIRO: People who want to fight climate change often talk about Delhi air pollution because it's something you can see and feel. Are you motivated to do something about climate change or is it mostly Delhi air pollution? BAHL: I don't think I can contribute in any meaningful way at all. I can contribute individually, but not in a systemic fashion or at scale. SHAPIRO: Although, you know, people who work on climate change will say a lot of collective individual actions will lead to massive change on a societal scale. BAHL: I think - you know, I don't think that happens in India. We are still a developing country, and we are largely fighting for survival necessities. Climate change are luxuries for people who already have a comfortable life. Twenty kilometers out of Delhi, and go to the villages, and go and talk to them. They might not even know what climate change is because they are still fighting for survival. MONTAGNE: God, Ari, I'm out of breath just listening to the two of you this last couple of minutes. Now, that was Sheeta Behel running with you in New Delhi. SHAPIRO: Yeah, and you heard him say India is still a developing country. And that's really at the crux of all this. India is the third-largest carbon emitter in the world behind the U. S. and China. But it is just getting started. Per person, Indians use so much less energy than Americans or Chinese people. I mean, three-quarters of people in India live on 2 dollars a day or less. So you imagine, what if all of those people had electricity at night, a refrigerator, a car? What happens next in India could have a huge impact on the world, and has the potential to really write a new story on how developing countries enter the 21st century, whether it's clean or dirty and whether the world can really alter the course on climate change or not.

Environmentalists see an opportunity there to transform a conversation about pollution into a popular movement on climate change. My colleague, Ari Shapiro, has that story to wrap up his week of reporting from New Delhi. ARI SHAPIRO, BYLINE: This is an unusual scene in an upscale neighborhood. There's art on the walls and plants flowering in colorful pots. It's a fancy living room that is right now serving as a waiting room. The patients are maids, security guards, construction workers - people who earn, at most, a few dollars a day - sitting on elegant furniture. This is the home of Dr. Gita Prakash. She's at her dining room table with a stethoscope pressed to a pregnant woman's chest. GITA PRAKASH: It's almost like a charitable clinic, but I do charge them a little bit because I find if I don't then they don't respect you for what you're giving them. SHAPIRO: She's been doing this for 30 years, six nights a week, in the evenings after she finishes her rounds at the hospital. And over the decades, the kinds of problems she treats have changed. PRAKASH: You know, there's a lot more of coughs and colds and allergies and asthmas, which were not so prevalent earlier. SHAPIRO: New Delhi has some of the most polluted air in the world, and a lot of patients at this clinic spend all day outdoors, like this man, restaurant deliveryman Dilip Kumar Chaudhury. He's brought his feverish son in for treatment. I asked the father what it feels like inhaling fumes in traffic day after day. DILIP KUMAR CHAUDHURY: (Through interpreter) I feel very strange. I feel very stressed. My whole body sweats a lot. I feel very tired. SHAPIRO: Dr. Prakash treated the son, but she's worried about the father too. PRAKASH: I know that he'll be back in two days with his cough. The problem is that he'll probably have infected his son by then. SHAPIRO: As a doctor, what do you do? PRAKASH: I pray. (Laughter). SHAPIRO: On the other side of New Delhi, at an upscale shopping mall, everyone is talking about the air problem. This is a rally for the campaign Help Delhi Breathe. There's a stage with bands and kiosks where people sell clean-air accessories, like Kuldip Singh with his high-fashion Vogue Masks. KULDIP SINGH: We have vegan leather masks also for the bikers. SHAPIRO: Vegan leather masks? SINGH: Yeah, for the bikers. SHAPIRO: For the bikers who are also vegans. The organizer of Help Delhi Breathe is Reecha Upadhyay. In a way, she says, Delhi's filthy air is an opportunity to talk about something more abstract - climate change. REECHA UPADHYAY: It's a concept. It's not a reality for a lot of people. And - but air pollution, it's a reality because it's now affecting your kids, and, you know, you can feel how it affects you. And it's a very tangible thing that people have in their minds and can experience. SHAPIRO: India is the largest democracy in the world. Environmentalists, like the people behind Help Delhi Breathe, hope that public pressure will push the government towards clean energy policies. These days, lots of Indian people get daily air-quality readings from a monitor at the U. S. Embassy. Their daily ratings are published in the papers, and there are apps to track it. So here's a big sign that says air-quality monitor. In this city, they feel pretty good about a day when the reading is below 50 micrograms per cubic meter. The day Liam Fitzgerald showed me the embassy monitor, the number was over a hundred. The chart tops out at 500. LIAM FITZGERALD: We've hit over 500 on this. SHAPIRO: What does the air feel like on days like that? FITZGERALD: Chunky. (Laughter). SHAPIRO: In the filtered, cooled air of the U. S. Embassy, Ambassador Richard Verma told me he thinks public sentiment may help push India to take the lead on clean energy and climate change. RICHARD VERMA: There's no other country on the planet that has set the kind of renewable targets and goals that India has. So I think the way to get there is a challenge, but India, I think, is really going to be a trailblazer in this whole area. SHAPIRO: People here know that a failure to do that would be catastrophic. Next week, we'll visit a part of India where people are already suffering from the impacts of climate change - the largest mangrove forest in the world, where thousands of people are leaving sinking islands that are being swallowed up by the sea. ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:  In India's cities, people are becoming aware that the air is unhealthy to breathe. Environmentalists see an opportunity there to transform a conversation about pollution into a popular movement on climate change. My colleague, Ari Shapiro, has that story to wrap up his week of reporting from New Delhi. ARI SHAPIRO, BYLINE: This is an unusual scene in an upscale neighborhood. There's art on the walls and plants flowering in colorful pots. It's a fancy living room that is right now serving as a waiting room. The patients are maids, security guards, construction workers - people who earn, at most, a few dollars a day - sitting on elegant furniture. This is the home of Dr. Gita Prakash. She's at her dining room table with a stethoscope pressed to a pregnant woman's chest. GITA PRAKASH: It's almost like a charitable clinic, but I do charge them a little bit because I find if I don't then they don't respect you for what you're giving them. SHAPIRO: She's been doing this for 30 years, six nights a week, in the evenings after she finishes her rounds at the hospital. And over the decades, the kinds of problems she treats have changed. PRAKASH: You know, there's a lot more of coughs and colds and allergies and asthmas, which were not so prevalent earlier. SHAPIRO: New Delhi has some of the most polluted air in the world, and a lot of patients at this clinic spend all day outdoors, like this man, restaurant deliveryman Dilip Kumar Chaudhury.

Then-President George W. Bush ordered 28 pages restricted to official eyes only. And those pages have remained classified ever since. Intelligence officials are reviewing them now to see whether some or all of them can now be released. That review is expected to wrap up next month, but it may already be damaging U. S. relations with Saudi Arabia, as NPR's David Welna reports. DAVID WELNA, BYLINE: Late last month on this show, we heard from Bob Graham, the Florida Democrat who helped lead the Congressional 9/11 investigation as chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee. Graham has since retired from Congress, but he continues to push, as he has all along, for those 28 pages dealing with foreign financing of the 9/11 hijackers to be made public. BOB GRAHAM: While I can't discuss the details of that chapter, they point a strong finger at Saudi Arabia. WELNA: And some of Graham's former colleagues on the Intelligence Committee are now seconding his call. RON WYDEN: The American people deserve to see this information. WELNA: That's Oregon Democratic Senator Ron Wyden. He's co-sponsoring a bill mandating declassification of those 28 pages. WYDEN: Then there'll be a debate about what the pages mean. I've read them. The American people deserve to know what's in them. DIANNE FEINSTEIN: I think it would clear the air. WELNA: That California's Dianne Feinstein, the Senate Intelligence Panel's top Democrat. FEINSTEIN: I've read the 28 pages now over the years three times. I just read them again last week. And it's my belief that investigative bodies have found essentially no evidence that the 28 pages relate to any specific government's culpability. WELNA: A later report by a Blue Ribbon 9/11 Commission did indeed find no evidence that quote, \"the Saudi government as an institution or senior Saudi officials had funded al-Qaida. \" Still, John Lehman, one of that panel's Republican members, told The Guardian newspaper that report should not be read as an exoneration of Saudi Arabia. He too called for declassifying the 28 pages. White House spokesman Josh Earnest said earlier this month that a lengthy evaluation about whether to do that is nearing completion. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JOSH EARNEST: The good news is that our intelligence officials have indicated that they expect to complete that process by the end of June. You know, we'll look forward to their decision at that point. WELNA: At least one top intelligence official is against releasing the 28 pages. CIA Director John Brennan made that clear earlier this month on NBC's \"Meet The Press. \"(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"MEET THE PRESS\")JOHN BRENNAN: I think some people may seize upon that uncorroborated, unvetted information that was in there that was basically just a collation of this information that came out of FBI files. And to point to Saudi involvement, which I think would be very, very inaccurate. WELNA: Saudi Arabia, for its part, formally requested 13 years ago that the 28 pages be made public. Meanwhile, two leading senators, New York Democrat Chuck Schumer and Texas Republican John Cornyn, are promoting legislation that would strip away so-called sovereign immunity protections from any nation linked to terrorist attacks on American soil. Here's Senator Cornyn. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JOHN CORNYN: It creates a very narrow provision, which may or may not apply to Saudi Arabia. But my attitude is let the chips fall where they may. Let's bring justice to the victims and the 9/11 families and deter, to the extent we can, terrorist attacks on our own soil. WELNA: That bill is not supported by the Obama administration. Secretary of State John Kerry warned Congress earlier this year, such a bill could backfire. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)SEC OF STATE JOHN KERRY: We'd be very troubled by it because what it would do is really expose the United States of America to lawsuit and take away our sovereign immunity and create a terrible precedent in its current form. WELNA: But Connecticut Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal's not buying that argument. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL: The families deserve no less than accountability from Saudi Arabia. The United States has nothing to fear, and the administration has been excessively defensive on this issue.

The next largest group, though, were Afghans - a painful reminder of an earlier time after the 1979 Soviet invasion when millions fled that country. The current president, Ashraf Ghani, was himself caught outside his country. After the Taliban government fell, he was part of the mass return. We recently sat down with the First Lady of Afghanistan, Rula Ghani, who was at the embassy in Washington. And we talked about why it is that people, many of them young men from Afghanistan's small middle class, needed - are fleeing when they're needed to rebuild the country. RULA GHANI: The numbers I have seen is that last year, the number of Afghans who left the country was 180,000, which is, you know, for a country of 32 million people, is not such a huge number. There are quite a few. There are families. And their situation is really terrible and not easy at all. And some of them have lost some members of the family while crossing the waters. So I don't make light of the situation. MONTAGNE: Having said that, it's a concern, though, in Afghanistan. GHANI: It is a concern. And we have had people leave. Keep in mind that these people have to pay up to $10,000 per person. So those who are leaving are people who have some kind of access to resources to be able to afford paying the traffickers. And so it is a pity because these are people who have already some skills, who are working. They leave paying jobs. I'm not really quite sure whether the lure is a better life, whether it's the lack of security in Afghanistan or the perceived lack of security. But it is slowly receding now because now we have had already some people who have come back, especially those who have lost loved ones. Often, it's children they've lost in the waters. It's really heartbreaking. And they come back to bury them. And they don't want to go again. They don't want to try again. So the stories are filtering back that the roads are not paved with gold. And this is not really the best solution. Leaving the country is not the best solution. MONTAGNE: Still, though, it's enough talked about that a few weeks ago, your husband, President Ashraf Ghani, he inveighed against - especially those younger people, the ones that might be more educated, you know, leaving Afghanistan. And I'm quoting him. He said, \"they break the social contract. \" But President Ghani left the country for college. He didn't come back for 30 years. So how would that be different? I mean, is there a different standard for the privileged that can come and go or leave for a long time and come back? GHANI: No, not at all. It's true that my husband left for his education in Afghanistan. At the time, we were coming back. And everybody told us not to because all his family had been put in prison, all the male members of his family. So it was not a very conducive time for us to come back. But all his life, my husband studied how he could make better Afghanistan. And this is why now that the time has come and he can help his country, he's putting in 16-hour days to find ways of rebuilding this country. And he's doing a very good job. So if he has no patience for people who decide that, well, OK, the grass is much greener on the other side of the fence, I can understand him. MONTAGNE: There certainly, though, has been an effort. There was a social media campaign in Afghanistan with one image saying don't go. Stay with me. There might be no return. And through the door you see bodies on a beach, clearly people who have gone into the water. Has that worked? GHANI: I'm not quite sure whether this had a particular effect. It might have. What I know is that, yes, people are no longer really rushing to leave because they've seen what's happened to other people who have left and have not really found solace at the end of the road. MONTAGNE: Thank you very much for joining us. GHANI: You're welcome. It was a pleasure being with you, Renee.

There was a social media campaign in Afghanistan with one image saying don't go. Stay with me. There might be no return. And through the door you see bodies on a beach, clearly people who have gone into the water. Has that worked? GHANI: I'm not quite sure whether this had a particular effect. It might have. What I know is that, yes, people are no longer really rushing to leave because they've seen what's happened to other people who have left and have not really found solace at the end of the road. MONTAGNE: Thank you very much for joining us. GHANI: You're welcome. It was a pleasure being with you, Renee. MONTAGNE: That was Afghanistan's First Lady Rula Ghani speaking to us from Afghanistan's embassy in Washington.", "section": "World", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

That's the EgyptAir passenger jet which has disappeared en route to Cairo. Two facts we do know - the plane took off last night at 11:09 p. m. Paris time. And the airport from which it flew was Paris Charles de Gaulle. That's where we find Raphael Satter this morning. He's a reporter with the AP. Hi, Raphael. RAPHAEL SATTER: Good morning. KELLY: Can you describe the scene for us at the airport right now? SATTER: This scene is now finally quieting down after a very hectic morning. There are a lot of journalists still by the EgyptAir desk, which is just upstairs from where I am in Hall 5 of Terminal 1. But the check-in desks are closed. The EgyptAir desk is empty. And the - today's EgyptAir flight is just about to leave to go to Cairo on that very same route. KELLY: This is the first EgyptAir flight to depart Paris since the crash. And I gather that there are family members aboard. What do we know about that? SATTER: That's what we gather, too. But it's important to keep in mind that these family members have been kept very separate from the general public, the general traveling public and, indeed, journalists since this morning. They've been kept in the Mercure Hotel, which is about 1 or 2 kilometers from where I'm standing. And it's not entirely clear, even to the journalists who are here, how it is that they've gotten aboard the plane. In any case, they haven't boarded like the other passengers have. So in fact, we haven't been able to speak to very many although we have seen them go back and forth. KELLY: And we should just note - the figures that we have been given by EgyptAir - that there were 15 French aboard, 30 Egyptians, 2 Iraqis and then a lot of other nationalities. And they've all been - many of them gathering at Charles de Gaulle trying to figure out what happened to their family members. It sounds, at the moment, as though there are more journalists than passengers and ticket agents around. SATTER: I think that one of the ticket agents told one of my journalist colleagues here that there were a lot of cancellations today. And so I think it's going to be - I can't know for sure at this point, but it may be a rather empty flight. KELLY: Describe for us what kind of security you're seeing there. We're talking about an airport in a city that, of course, was attacked - a terrorist attack this past fall. Security has already been so tight. I mean, how did you even manage to get to the airport and get inside? SATTER: There isn't - the airport wasn't on lockdown. And it isn't on lockdown. So we're not talking about soldiers and barricades or anything like that. There is a police presence at the airport. In fact, a few meters from where I stand, there are some police walking around, one carrying a rifle. There were some bomb-sniffing dogs doing the rounds. But, in fact, it's not on lockdown. It's rather - it's nothing unusual. And it's rather - it's actually rather relaxed here. KELLY: And just - we just have a few seconds left, Raphael. But I'm sure you've been talking to other other passengers. You mentioned there are some cancellations. Are people nervous? SATTER: Yes. I think even the people who boarded the flight today were very nervous. And I spoke to a mother whose daughter boarded. She said that her daughter took a lot of convincing in order to fly today. KELLY: Sure. SATTER: But I could see in the mother's eyes that she wasn't completely convinced. She said she was still worried sick. KELLY: OK. Thank you so much for talking to us. SATTER: Thanks for having me. KELLY: Raphael Satter, reported for the - reporter for The Associated Press in Paris. MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:  There is a lot we don't know about Flight 804.

This morning, the plane vanished on its way from Paris to Cairo, just after entering Egyptian airspace. Greek officials, who were monitoring the flight as it passed through Greek airspace, say the plane swerved and spun sharply shortly before disappearing from radar. We're joined once again by NPR's Russell Lewis. He covers aviation. Good Morning to you, Russell. RUSSELL LEWIS, BYLINE: Good morning. KELLY: Things have been moving very fast this morning, as you know. A Lot of conflicting reports. I wonder if you could help us step back - big picture, put in perspective what we know, what we do not know about what happened to this plane? LEWIS: Well, we don't know what caused the plane to potentially go down. We don't know where it is. And those are the sort of the big two unanswered questions at this point. And that's where investigators are trying to sort of zero in on. There was a press briefing by Egypt's aviation minister today who said that the crash was more likely caused by a terror attack than technical problems. But it's hard to say at this point how he can come to that conclusion when there hasn't even been wreckage found of this plane. KELLY: Emily Harris is in Cairo. And you were at his press conference, Emily, - is that right? - where Egyptian officials were talking about the plane and why it might have crashed. EMILY HARRIS, BYLINE: That's right. And Civil Aviation Minister of Egypt Sharif Fathi was talking. And he spoke for a long period of time and mostly repeated the message that he wasn't going to get to any conclusions right now. Russell's right. There was a quote that's been getting a lot of attention that he said - to not - as his response to a question - to not - he's going to try not to jump to the conclusion that it's mechanical failure. He said it may point to that. He said, I'm saying may because I don't want to speculate. But then he said, if you analyze it properly, the possibility of this being something other than mechanical or - the possibility of terrorism is higher than a technical problem at this point. It's unclear exactly what he meant, whether that was - he was - a comment on the reliability of modern planes or whether he does have some information that he's not fully sharing about what did happen to the plane or whether he's highlighting some bit of information in his, what he called a proper analysis. But overall, his message in this news conference was don't jump to any conclusions until we have something concrete to say, which is frustrating a lot of Egyptian reporters. And certainly families are waiting for information here, too. KELLY: Sure, so we have officials in Greece, in Egypt, in France, in the United States - all over - weighing in. Lots of conflicting messages. So far at this point, bottom line, no evidence that this was terrorism. We don't know what it might have been. You were at the airport in Cairo this morning, Emily. Tell us what the scene was like there. HARRIS: As an arriving passenger, everything seemed normal. My plane was delayed. Apparently, it had been late coming out of Cairo to get to Tel Aviv where I came from. But going through was smooth. It seemed very quiet. My colleague, our NPR producer here, had been at the airport much earlier at about 7:30 in the morning. And after a couple of hours of waiting at the EgyptAir administration office there, about a half a dozen people came out who - some of them were clearly family members who had been seeking information. And he spoke briefly to one who was wiping away tears and expressed some frustration. But other than that, the airport seems to be running normally. KELLY: OK, and we should note there were 66 passengers on board. That includes both - 66 people on board, I should say. That includes both passengers and crew, the majority of them Egyptian, others French, Iraqi, other nationalities. Russell Lewis, let me let you give us some perspective on this 'cause you've covered plenty of plane crashes for us in the past. Based on your experience, how long might it take to determine what caused this crash? Especially in a case like this, a crash over water. We don't have the black box. LEWIS: Sure. So, I mean, it could take years, to be honest. We might get some preliminary sort of indications in the coming weeks and months. But it certainly is going to be a long-running thing. I mean, we should point out that the absence of a distress call from the flight deck suggests that whatever it is that sent this Airbus A320 sort of plummeting towards the Mediterranean, it was sudden and it was brief. But again, we shouldn't look into that much to say why hasn't there been a distress call? There's a saying in aviation to aviate, navigate and communicate, in that order. Meaning, fly the plane, figure out where you're at and then sort of the third thing that you should do is to talk to people about what's going on. So it sure sounds like the flight deck had their hands full with whatever it was that happened today. KELLY: OK, thanks to you both. LEWIS: Thank you. HARRIS: Thank you. LEWIS: That's NPR's Russell Lewis in Birmingham, Ala. And then we were also joined there by NPR's Emily Harris. She is in Cairo. They are both tracking events on this very sad story.

Greek officials say their air traffic controllers were tracking the plane as it fell 22,000 feet and then disappeared from their radar. With us now is aviation analyst Alex Macheras. He's on Skype from London. We're also joined by NPR's Emily Harris, who is in Cairo. Good morning to both of you. ALEX MACHERAS: Good morning. EMILY HARRIS, BYLINE: Good morning. KELLY: Emily, let me start with you. You just landed in Cairo. What was the scene inside the airport? HARRIS: From all I could tell, things were operating normally. It wasn't a very busy morning in the baggage claim or through passport control, but there wasn't a great police presence. There wasn't any area cordoned off. Our flight arriving from Tel Aviv was late because it was late coming out of Cairo, but there was no sign of anything out of the ordinary just as a passenger coming through the airport. Not far away from there, the Ministry of Civil Aviation was, shortly after I landed, briefing the press, the reporters about what happened, what they know - or really, what they mostly still don't know about this plane. KELLY: Right. What were the headlines there? HARRIS: Very packed scene, a lot of Egyptian reporters really demanding - wanting to know what was going on. But really little information from the minister, who was briefing the main message that he kept saying was we're going to call this a missing plane until we know for sure what happened. They did give some information about where it was last - the communication was last had when it was just leaving Greek airspace. They have sent some rescue efforts, and he said that there were 66 people total on board, including seven crew and three security staff of EgyptAir. KELLY: Right. We know that it had just crossed into Egyptian airspace when it disappeared. Alex, let me bring you in. You've been tracking all of these developments today from London. One note since we last spoke to you - we have reports that debris has been found near where the last transponder signal was omitted. Of course, there's a lot of debris out there in the ocean at any given time. Should we read anything into this? MACHERAS: Good morning. Yes, that's correct. So in the last few minutes, we have had that confirmation from the Greek transport ministry, who's said that actually, they're not calling it debris as such, but they are calling it objects floating in the sea about 50 miles or so away from the last known position of the sea that this aircraft was flying over. And just to recap, this EgyptAir A320 was last seen on radar at 37,000 feet just north of Alexandria, over the Mediterranean, just to the west of Cyprus. Now this isn't a particularly large area. And so for those speculating that oh God, have we got another MH370 on our hands where, two years later, we're still unable to find anything, this should not be the case. And I would expect that the Egyptian search teams find the crash site, as they're expecting it to be, today. In fact, my gut feeling says that they have already found it. I've spoken to a colleague in Cairo, Richard, who said to me that actually, the media there aren't convinced that the Egyptian authorities are letting on everything that they do know. KELLY: All right, so lots still to follow there. Walk us through what we do know about the final moments of this flight. We said that they were in contact with Greek authorities. MACHERAS: They were. So - excuse me - this was the handover from Greek airspace to Egyptian airspace, which is routine when flying across international borders. So this involved was the flight crew speaking to Greek air traffic controllers, basically telling them that OK, they're leaving Greek airspace now, and then entering Egyptian airspace and speaking to the Egypt center air traffic control. Now we know that that did happen. Once the aircraft - EgyptAir plane crossed into Egyptian airspace, they flew for 10 miles. And during those 10 miles, they had spoken to air traffic control in Egypt to let them know of their whereabouts. It was then around 10 miles later that the aircraft disappeared from radar. We've had the transport minister tell us in a press conference in Cairo today that the aircraft is believed to have descended 22,000 feet violently whilst making 360-degree turns. But the Greeks have just contradicted this, so I think until we see the crash site, we - it's not really a clear image as of yet. KELLY: OK. And just to be clear, last-minute swerving - that could be down to any number of things. It could be down to the pilot being incapacitated. It could be down to weather. It could be down to mechanical failure. It could be down to terrorism. We just don't know. Emily Harris back in Cairo, tell us what you can about the search efforts. We mentioned maybe some debris in the Mediterranean. I assume that boats are out there combing the waters. HARRIS: Egypt has sent planes and boats, and France was due to also send some support for rescue efforts. And just to echo this sense of skepticism, I would say among the Egyptian press core there definitely seems to be a sense of perhaps the Egyptian air authorities and the civil aviation minister have more information than they're sharing at the moment. That may come from the last - the way the Egyptian officials reacted to the last flight that disappeared after taking off from Egypt back on October 31 last fall, which did turn out to be terrorism. It was a Russian airliner that blew up over the Sinai. And for a long time, the Egyptian officials didn't acknowledge it was terrorism. And so that's left a deep sense of skepticism here. KELLY: I'm sure that there is resistance to wanting to think that it is terrorism. And also, you know, Egypt, a country very much reliant on tourist dollars, wanting to hope that that is the very last possible scenario. HARRIS: Yes, that's right. Egypt has been suffering a lot with tourism, and that's not good advertising for anyone. As far as the search efforts go, the Egyptian officials say they are - have gathered families in a hotel here near the airport. My colleague here, my Egyptian colleague, spoke to one woman very briefly this morning who was coming out of an EgyptAir office with no information, talking about her daughter and wiping away some tears, and her son asked us not to speak with her at that time. But families are waiting for information along with everyone else. KELLY: OK. Alex, just one more quick question to you. We just have about 20 seconds left. But just quickly, the actual plane in question - we said there were 66 people on board. Is this a big plane? MACHERAS: Well, this is an Airbus A320, so it's a very typical short-haul commercial airliner, the workhorse of the skies. One takes off or lands every two-and-a-half seconds. The fact that there were 60 on board is a particularly light load. It could be as many as just under 200 on this aircraft. KELLY: OK, thank you very much. Thanks to you both. That's Alex Macheras, aviation analyst, in London. We've also been hearing from NPR's Emily Harris, who just landed in Cairo.

It could be down to mechanical failure. It could be down to terrorism. We just don't know. Emily Harris back in Cairo, tell us what you can about the search efforts. We mentioned maybe some debris in the Mediterranean. I assume that boats are out there combing the waters. HARRIS: Egypt has sent planes and boats, and France was due to also send some support for rescue efforts. And just to echo this sense of skepticism, I would say among the Egyptian press core there definitely seems to be a sense of perhaps the Egyptian air authorities and the civil aviation minister have more information than they're sharing at the moment. That may come from the last - the way the Egyptian officials reacted to the last flight that disappeared after taking off from Egypt back on October 31 last fall, which did turn out to be terrorism. It was a Russian airliner that blew up over the Sinai. And for a long time, the Egyptian officials didn't acknowledge it was terrorism. And so that's left a deep sense of skepticism here. KELLY: I'm sure that there is resistance to wanting to think that it is terrorism. And also, you know, Egypt, a country very much reliant on tourist dollars, wanting to hope that that is the very last possible scenario. HARRIS: Yes, that's right. Egypt has been suffering a lot with tourism, and that's not good advertising for anyone. As far as the search efforts go, the Egyptian officials say they are - have gathered families in a hotel here near the airport. My colleague here, my Egyptian colleague, spoke to one woman very briefly this morning who was coming out of an EgyptAir office with no information, talking about her daughter and wiping away some tears, and her son asked us not to speak with her at that time. But families are waiting for information along with everyone else. KELLY: OK. Alex, just one more quick question to you. We just have about 20 seconds left. But just quickly, the actual plane in question - we said there were 66 people on board. Is this a big plane? MACHERAS: Well, this is an Airbus A320, so it's a very typical short-haul commercial airliner, the workhorse of the skies. One takes off or lands every two-and-a-half seconds. The fact that there were 60 on board is a particularly light load. It could be as many as just under 200 on this aircraft. KELLY: OK, thank you very much. Thanks to you both. That's Alex Macheras, aviation analyst, in London. We've also been hearing from NPR's Emily Harris, who just landed in Cairo.", "section": "World", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.

Flight 804 departed Paris at 11:09 p. m. Paris time. It headed on a southeast arc down towards Cairo. That would normally be just over a four-hour flight. But somewhere over the Mediterranean Sea, not long before it was due to land, the plane dropped from the sky. MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: We are tracking this story all morning. And for the latest, we're joined now by NPR's Eleanor Beardsley in Paris and by David Kirkpatrick of The New York Times in Cairo. Welcome to you both. ELEANOR BEARDSLEY, BYLINE: Thank you. KELLY: David. . . DAVID KIRKPATRICK, BYLINE: Hello. KELLY: Good morning, hey. Can you bring us up to speed? We know that in Cairo, there's just been a press conference with the latest on this. Egypt's aviation minister said that the possibility of a terror attack is stronger than the possibility of technical failure. Did he offer evidence of that? KIRKPATRICK: He - no. He said very little. You seem to have plucked out just about the strongest thing he said. His main point was that from the Egyptian government's point of view, almost any conclusion is premature at this point. He resisted even calling it a crash and insisted on calling it a disappearance until the wreckage is discovered. KELLY: And that fits with what we have heard from Egypt in the past couple of incidents that have involved Egypt and planes where they have resisted conclusions early on. Based on your experience, how do you see this investigation unfolding? KIRKPATRICK: Well, the precedent is not only that they resist conclusions early on, that they resist them for a long time. You know, the most famous episode was the crash of EgyptAir 990 off the coast of the U. S. 18 years ago. The U. S. government and most journalists and other investigators have concluded, I think with good reason, that that was a suicide by the Egyptian pilot. The Egyptians, 18 years later, are still trying to argue that it may well have been mechanical failure on the part of the Boeing airplane. In the more recent case last October, when the world has concluded that a terrorist bomb brought down a Russian jet that took off from Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt's aviation officials continue to say they're not so sure about that. It may have been mechanical failure, even though, in this case, the president of Egypt himself, in an apparent impromptu aside during a speech, has acknowledged that it was a terrorist bombing. So they're very reluctant to reach conclusions that they feel are embarrassing or politically awkward. . . KELLY: OK, that. . . KIRKPATRICK: . . . When it comes to aviation investigations. KELLY: That brings us up to this morning and how the investigation is unfolding already in Cairo. Do we know what threads they're following? Do we know where it's headed? KIRKPATRICK: I think right now they're looking for the wreckage in the Mediterranean. And that's all we've got from the Egyptian government's point of view. KELLY: And still no sign of the plane. Eleanor Beardsley in Paris, let me bring you in. Authorities in Paris have also already launched an investigation. What do we know about that? BEARDSLEY: Absolutely, Mary Louise. The Paris prosecutor opened an investigation this morning. And they're going to start with anyone who had anything to do with that flight at the airport. So this will be baggage handlers, anyone who came into contact with passengers or technical people for that flight. That's where it's going to start. France is also looking at sending its bureau of aviation accidents to Cairo to help with the investigation. Now they - this bureau investigated the Germanwings crash in the Alps and also remember the Rio to Paris flight that went down, the Air France flight. So they have a strong history of investigating, you know, air accidents. KELLY: Right. BEARDSLEY: In the next hour, EgyptAir is chartering a flight to Cairo for the family and friends of anyone on that flight. So that'll be taking off from Charles de Gaulle within the next hour. MONTAGNE: And let me just bring us back to what we know and don't know about the last moments for this plane. Eleanor, it was actually Greek authorities that were last in touch with the EgyptAir plane. The pilot had been talking to Greek air-traffic controllers. What do we know about its last moments? BEARDSLEY: Right, well, the Greek Military says radar tracked the plane dropping from 22,000 feet after swerving violently. And this was about 2:40 in the morning, right before it disappeared. So that seems to be the last moments. President Francois Hollande has recognized that it was a crash, basically, over the sea. KELLY: OK, lots we don't know still unfolding this morning. That's updates there from NPR's Eleanor Beardsley in Paris. We also heard from David Kirkpatrick of The New York Times in Cairo. And we will keep bringing you more on this story as we get it.

I'm Michel Martin. We start the program with the EgyptAir flight from Paris to Cairo, which crashed on Thursday. A few new clues emerged today in the effort to learn why. Officials say there's not enough evidence yet to favor any one possibility. In Egypt, aviation officials have told family members of passengers that it will take weeks to identify human remains found in the wreckage. NPR's Emily Harris joins us now from Cairo, where she's covering this story. Emily, thanks so much for speaking with us. EMILY HARRIS, BYLINE: It's my pleasure, Michel. MARTIN: Can you tell us what's been recovered from the wreckage so far? HARRIS: A little bit. The Egyptian military posted some photos and a video. The video shows a motorboat with five people in it out picking up debris from the water. And then the wreckage is shown spread out on the deck of a navy ship that includes what looks like a white high-top tennis shoe, parts of seats from the airplane, torn carpet, pieces of metal, including one that says EgyptAir on it. Additionally, as you mentioned, officials say they have found human remains and told families of passengers that finding and identifying the remains could take a long time. Egypt's civilian aviation minister says that what is still missing are the flight data and voice recorders. Crucial pieces of information may be contained in those. MARTIN: But we understand that some data communications from the plane's last minutes have emerged. Can you tell us what those are? HARRIS: Yeah, these are automatic messages that are sent during the flight back to land when something goes wrong on the plane. This was reported by The Aviation Herald, an industry website. There were seven messages, each just are a few words. They're all sent within the last three minutes before contact was lost with the plane. Two of these mention smoke. One says smoke, lavatory, smoke and ones says avionic smoke. And that apparently prefers the avionics area, which would be under the cockpit. But a spokesman for the French agency that's assisting Europe with this investigation says there is not enough information in these short messages to conclude what caused these apparent problems that happened on board. MARTIN: So before we let you go, can you tell us what investigators are considering? HARRIS: Well, they say they're still considering all scenarios. Three main possibilities that have been cited - deliberate pilot or co-pilot action, mechanical failure or terrorism. There hasn't been a claim of responsibility by any terrorist group to this point. But on the day the plane went down, Egypt's civil aviation minister did say that terrorism, if you think about it rationally, is more likely than mechanical failure. I should point out this was - he was pressed on this question many times. And he tried to avoid making any conclusions but did say that during the news conference. It's not clear whether he was suggesting that modern planes are unlikely to fail or he was suggesting that given this particular period of time there's a high chance of terrorism. But beyond that statement, no officials have indicated one cause over the other to this point. MARTIN: That's NPR's Emily Harris in Cairo. Thanks Emily. HARRIS: Thank You, Michel.

I'm talking about water. That's one reason I head to Fort Collins, Colo. this week for the latest in a series of NPR events focused on important issues that we call our Going There series. Our event in Fort Collins is called The Future of Water. But first, we want to dig into a recent report by the World Bank that addresses climate change, water and economic growth. According to the report, the impact of climate change will be felt mainly through water. Water scarcity, already a problem, could dramatically slow down world economic growth, push more people to migrate and spark even more global conflict. But not all hope is lost. The report also says that potentially affected countries can mitigate the effects of water scarcity by taking action now to use water more efficiently. We wanted to talk more about this, so we called the lead author, World Bank lead environmental economist Richard Damania. And we reached him in Colombo, Sri Lanka. Mr. Damania, thank you so much for speaking with us. RICHARD DAMANIA: Thank you, Michel. MARTIN: What does this report pull together? What does it accomplish that previous ones have not, in your view? DAMANIA: I think there are two important things that this report highlights. The first is that as you suggested earlier - that the major impacts of climate change are felt through water, things like more intense rainfall, droughts, cyclones. Indeed, I'm here in Colombo and it's pouring with rain. And there's a threat of floods, which are unseasonal and unexpected. And that's one of the things that the report highlights. It also highlights that if you happen to have in some senses the misfortune of living in an area that's dry, most likely you're going to get even drier. Another important point - we all know that we need water to live, but seldom do we recognize that the economy also needs water. MARTIN: The report says that water scarcity exacerbated by climate change could cost some regions up to 6 percent of GDP. How did you arrive at that figure? DAMANIA: We combined a model of climate change with a hydrological cycle, and then we fed through what would be the likely consequences of climate change - shrinking, shriveling supplies of water - on economic growth. If you don't have the water and your business needs water, of course this is going to increase your costs. Costs go up, therefore growth tends to be affected by it. So it's quite logical. MARTIN: It is quite logical. I mean, in a way it seems as though it's an issue that's hiding in plain sight. DAMANIA: I think that's partly because we tend to take water for granted. We assume that it's so abundant. And we really are set for a somewhat different world to what we've been experiencing in the past. MARTIN: Now the report does call for three sort of overarching policy priorities to help lead countries to what you call climate-resilient economies. What would such a framework look like? How would such a thing occur? DAMANIA: So what the report tries to emphasize is that if you have a shortage of water, there's really only three things that you can do. You can try to increase the supply of water, but that's dreadfully expensive. Or you could go to really expensive solutions like desalination or water reuse. But a lot more effort needs to be spent on managing demand. Today, in a lot of countries that are water scarce, more water is lost through leaking pipes than is actually delivered to people in their faucets. We also observe that in a lot of countries that are awfully dry, we provide them with, say, irrigation and they tend to grow rice and water-thirsty crops where really - in deserts and arid regions where one shouldn't be growing those water-thirsty crops. So these are the kinds of shifts that need to actually happen. But they are long-term shifts, and we need to start preparing and making them.

It's called \"High And Dry: Climate Change, Water And The Economy. \" And we reached Richard Damania in Colombo, Sri Lanka. Mr. Damania, thank you so much for speaking with us.

MARTIN: One of the important things about this book that you explain that perhaps people who have not had this experience may not understand is that it continues to intrude in your life. Reading from the book, you say that through the intervention of some inexplicable, chronological constant, rape is always now. Why is that? DOUGLAS: I think it's the sort of thing that always will have a lasting impact. It is life-changing. There's no question about that. MARTIN: Would you - would you want to describe briefly what happened as you recount it? DOUGLAS: I'll go through it very briefly indeed. I was 18 years of age. And I received an invitation from a local priest who had been a sort of unofficial chaplain at our school to attend a party he was throwing. I found him with some of my former schoolmates rapidly getting drunk. He wouldn't stop drinking. We were worried that he might get behind the wheel of his car and kill somebody, so we decided that somebody would stay with him. And that somebody was me. Shortly after everybody else did go, this individual who, as I did not know at the time but subsequently learned, was a serial sex offender, proposed - to put it bluntly - that I provide him with oral sex. We fought. I lost. And the next four hours were unpleasant. MARTIN: You know, what happened immediately after is that you went through this mental calculus with yourself trying to figure out who would believe you. And you almost immediately determined that nobody would. Why is that? DOUGLAS: Well, the principal reason was that my injuries were unimpressive. And being a young man in a blue-collar job going up against one of God's anointed, I decided that the credibility balance probably wasn't going to be in my favor. MARTIN: But you did try to alert your friends and church authorities. What happened then? What did they do? DOUGLAS: Well, I reported it firstly to a priest of the archdiocese. He started by giving me absolution for, as he put it, whatever sins I may have committed. The second time I wrote to directly to the Archbishop. He referred me to a diocesan official. I was interviewed by that official who did precisely nothing. I learned much later that that official contacted the perpetrator and told him that there was nothing to worry about, that I was not the kind of person to kick up a fuss. MARTIN: When you went for help to the rape support networks that existed at the time, there was no concept that this could have happened to a man. And in fact one person, who you even generously say might have been well-meaning, said if you really cared about rape that you would keep silent about it because that would - your story would detract from the focus on women who had been raped. How do you understand that now? How do you even process that now? DOUGLAS: I'm sorry to say that that attitude has remained quite prevalent over the years. We really still haven't developed a vocabulary with which to describe or conceptualize attacks of this kind. And there's really nobody who's working on it. MARTIN: The priest who raped you was eventually convicted of raping another boy. But - I don't know, you can tell me why - he never served a day in jail. How does that sit with you? DOUGLAS: Personally, putting him in prison would do little or nothing for me. There's no resolution. There's no satisfaction to be achieved from that. He managed to beat the rap by the fact that he had blown out his liver through intense alcohol abuse. But certainly, if I had the opportunity to send him off to jail tomorrow, I wouldn't lift my finger to bring that about. MARTIN: You would not? DOUGLAS: I wouldn't. MARTIN: Your attitude toward what happened to you seems very different from the stance that a lot of people take today. For example, beginning where we began our conversation, there seems to be this push to reframe this as I'm not a victim. I am a survivor, and I'm not going to let my rape define me. But you write - and I quote here - \"I'm compelled to acknowledge that being raped is the most consequential thing that has happened to me. \" And you also write (reading) I adhere to the word victim rather than survivor in the same way that I have chosen to acknowledge what happened to me as rape rather than sexual assault. Can you unpack that for us? DOUGLAS: Yes. So it's a difficult balance to strike between two truths that run in different directions. Life does go on. It can be a rewarding and valuable life. I am married to a wonderful woman. I have a wonderful daughter. I've had professional success. On the other hand, there is a sort of triumphalist narrative in which the pain and the ugliness and the permanence of sexual violence gets sidetracked in favor of a feel-good narrative in which one goes through a period of victimhood and then emerges as a, quote unquote, \"survivor. \"And one of the reasons that a lot of people are a little squicky about the word survivor is that it seems to imply that once you attain that status it's all done and dusted. It's all safely in the past. And for a huge number of people it isn't, and it won't be. It won't ever be. MARTIN: I'm sure there are people listening right now who, as you said, have experienced what you did and do not know what to do about it. Is there anything you wish to say to them? DOUGLAS: The most important thing - you're not alone. There are so many more of us out here than you think. Don't give up. MARTIN: Professor Raymond Douglas is a professor of history at Colgate University. His latest book is called \"On Being Raped. \" And he joined us from the BBC studios in London. Professor Douglas, my every good wish for you. And I thank you so much for speaking with us. DOUGLAS: Delighted. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  It's a courtesy - actually more like a requirement - in this news organization to let you know when we are about to talk about something you might find difficult or perhaps unsuitable for someone listening with you. This is one of those times. We're going to talk about rape. Specifically, men who've been victims of rape through the story of one man who's chosen to write about it. And I use the words rape and victim intentionally and specifically because those are the words our next guest chose. Professor Raymond Douglas teaches history at Colgate University in New York. He's published a number of books about the history of 20th century Europe. But he recently published a very different volume, one in which he reflects on his own rape by a priest when he was 18 years old. The book is called \"On Being Raped. \" And Professor Douglas joins today from our studios in London. And I need to remind our listeners once again that we are going to be talking about the issue of sexual violence for the next few minutes.

I'm Rachel Martin. And we begin this hour in Afghanistan because the government there says the leader of the Afghan Taliban has been killed by a U. S. drone strike this weekend. It's a clear reminder that while the U. S. is no longer in the lead and its presence there is a fraction of what it used to be, there is still a war happening in Afghanistan. In a moment we'll talk with a U. N. official based in Kabul about a program that's been trying to pay Taliban members to give up the fight. But first, we turn to NPR's Tom Bowman who is in Afghanistan now and joins us for the latest on this drone strike and the apparent death of this Taliban leader. Tom, good morning. TOM BOWMAN, BYLINE: Good morning, Rachel. MARTIN: What do we know about this operation that the Afghan government is now confirming killed Mullah Mansour? BOWMAN: Well, the Pentagon and also officials here say there were multiple drones involved in this mission by the American special operations forces. And it was authorized by President Obama.  And the attack took place in a remote area south of the Pakistan city of Quetta and not far from the border with Afghanistan's Kandahar province. Now the Taliban has not confirmed the death. That Afghan intelligence agency says he is dead. And the Americans, for their part, are saying they're still assessing the results of this attack. MARTIN: Tom, this is a Taliban leader who, at some point, was supposed to have been killed before, right? BOWMAN: That's right. Back in December, Mullah Mansour was involved in a gunfight with rival Taliban leaders over in Pakistan. In the reports, he was wounded and later died. And there are times, of course, when U. S. airstrikes claim they've killed someone and that's not the case. Now, Mullah Mansour has led the Taliban for the past three years. And he took over from the original Taliban leader this Mullah Omar who sheltered Osama bin Laden. And that, of course, led to the American intervention. MARTIN: You are in Afghanistan now. You've been reporting on the war there, though, for years. So Tom, what does it look like to you? How strong is the insurgency right now? And what would it mean to have Mullah Mansour out of this war? BOWMAN: Well, the Taliban, Rachel, made quite a few gains over the past year. They grabbed areas of southern Afghanistan and Helmand province that the U. S. Marines fought for seven years ago and paid a very heavy price in casualties. And now the U. S. has sent troops to work with the Afghans at lower levels in Helmand province closer to the front lines. And they're going to try to help the Afghans push back the Taliban. But, you know, it's too soon to say what impact Mullah Mansour's death will have if, in fact, he is dead. We spoke with one analyst here today in Kabul, Haroon Mir, who said it could be a game changer. And that's because you have no clear successor to Mullah Mansour. And the Taliban has fractured into rival groups. So you could have, on the one hand, no leader and multiple rival groups with no clear direction. But he also said there could be more Taliban attacks, more suicide attacks, to show the Taliban is still out there and basically seeking revenge for this.

In Austria, voters have narrowly elected a left-leaning, independent candidate who says immigration helps the economy. A far-right, populist candidate who talked tough about immigration and about Muslims lost barely. These results were being watched closely across Europe where the migration crisis has upended establishment politicians. Reporter Joanna Kakissis is on the line from Vienna. Joanna, good morning. JOANNA KAKISSIS, BYLINE: Good morning, David. GREENE: So this sounds like an incredibly close election. We're talking a razor-thin margin here. KAKISSIS: That's correct. It was very, very close, and it was decided today while officials were counting something like up to 900,000 ballots, mail-in ballots, absentee ballots. And those ballots, those voters went for Alexander Van der Bellen who is an independent candidate backed by the Green Party. He's actually a former leader of the Green Party. He's an economist. He's 72. He's a retired professor. And many Austrians saw him as the safe choice. They weren't crazy about him, but they saw him as a safer choice than Norbert Hofer, the leader of the far-right party, who also energized many Austrians but was also seen as very dangerous. GREENE: OK. Well, talk about - I mean, for a far-right candidate who is seen by some as dangerous to come this close, I mean, what exactly was he tapping into and what was significant here? KAKISSIS: That's a good question. What he was tapping into is unease about many, many migrants who have come to Austria in the last year. Austrians felt overwhelmed. They felt like they couldn't take care of all the people that were coming. Ninety thousand asylum-seekers arrived in Austria last year. They thought, will our money go - will our money be able to provide for them? Will we have places for them to live? And some Austrians were also scared that there would be a rise in violence. There were - there was a - there were a spate of crimes in the last few months that were caused by migrants. But people thought, OK, this is a trend, even though it - overall crime statistics did not go up. So there was this sense of fear, this sense that we can't manage this crisis. And the establishment politicians didn't do anything to help us. They just sort of let this ship go unmoored and were watching it. So this is one reason why Norbert Hofer did win so much support. GREENE: And where does he go from here politically? I mean, is that far-right movement that he tapped into - I mean, is it in trouble in Austria or are there places for him to go now? KAKISSIS: You know, this is actually a victory for him. Even though he's not president, he came very, very close. And I was at a party last night. They were celebrating - the Freedom Party was celebrating it. Norbert Hofer's party was celebrating it because they said even if Norbert Hofer is not president tomorrow, we won. We have half of Austrians behind us, and we are going to be a political force in Austria in the years to come. That's pretty accurate. And that's also - even though the Green candidate is now the president, it's troubling many European Union politicians that here we go, this party won half of Austrian support, half of Austrian votes. GREENE: All right. We've been speaking to reporter Joanna Kakissis this morning in Vienna as we're just getting results from a presidential election.

That's more than 2,000 miles. They didn't use a compass or a map or any modern instruments. They wanted to show that Hawaii could have been settled by Polynesian explorers who had intentionally made that same trip. And the canoe they took was named Hokule'a. That means star of gladness. And it helped revive interest in native Hawaiian culture. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: Now Hokule'a is attempting an even longer journey. It's two years into a voyage around the entire globe. This month, it reached the East Coast of the United States, and NPR's Adam Cole went to see it on the Potomac River in Washington, D. C. ADAM COLE, BYLINE: As soon as I climbed aboard, apprentice navigator Kala Baybayan Tanaka took one look at my pink face and offered me sunscreen. KALA BAYBAYAN TANAKA: Do you need sunscreen? We've got a whole big thing of sunscreen. COLE: I should probably. TANAKA: You should put sunscreen on. COLE: I mean, oh, my gosh, look at this thing of sunscreen. It was a full gallon jug, a volume of sunscreen you would only buy if you planned to sail around the world. There isn't much shade to be found on Hokule'a. Its structure is based on traditional Polynesian designs. Two 60-foot canoes are joined by a central deck, topped with red sales. And the whole thing is lashed together with six miles of rope. Kala, who hails from Maui, sleeps under a strip of canvas along one edge. TANAKA: The front of the canoe is the wettest part of the canoe. That would be where I am. COLE: Kala's father is also on the voyage. Kalepa Baybayan is one of the primary navigators, and that comes with privileges. TANAKA: He sleeps in the very back of the canoe (laughter). COLE: It's dry there, a real luxury suite. KALEPA BAYBAYAN: You sleep on that board - right? - with an Igloo cooler underneath. And then there's that hard, yellow pad. But me, I get special treatment. I have an extra pad. COLE: Oh really? BAYBAYAN: (Laughter) Yeah. COLE: Kalepa earned his choice bunk through decades of study. He can navigate the open ocean using a Polynesian technique that's thousands of years old. He doesn't use any instruments. Instead, he builds a compass in his mind based on celestial landmarks. BAYBAYAN: Anything you can see with your eyes is a reference point. COLE: The rising and setting of certain stars, the sun, the moon, passing birds. And when none of those is available, he relies on waves. BAYBAYAN: There's a motion that the canoe makes as it climbs up over the wave, and you have to internalize that as a rhythm. And you kind of just feel the pulse of the canoe. COLE: To navigate like this without a GPS or instruments of any kind, you not only have to know your direction, you have to keep track of your speed and remember exactly where you came from. Forty years ago, when Hokule'a was preparing for its first voyage, no one on Hawaii had that skill. But a master navigator from Micronesia volunteered to share his knowledge. And that was how Kalepa began to study the art of wayfinding. He's been sailing on Hokule'a ever since, even as he raised his children. TANAKA: I actually started voyaging just to understand or get to know my dad better. COLE: At first, Kala didn't get her dad's obsession. TANAKA: I was a typical high-schooler thinking about what other people were thinking about me and boys and fashion. But until I started voyaging, it kind of felt unfulfilled, like, I just felt like there was something missing. COLE: And then Kalepa started to teach her about wayfinding. TANAKA: Which is so truly central to who we are and how we came to settle the islands that we did. COLE: The current voyage is meant to celebrate that Polynesian heritage and the connections between humans and a fragile natural world. For Kala, it's about connections she makes with people who are also trying to move forward while rediscovering their past. TANAKA: We want to know their struggles and also their successes and how we can carry on their story and share it with our kids back home. COLE: On the first leg of this journey back in 2014, Kala learned she was pregnant with her second child. Kalepa chose the name, Tekauri, after a tree used by Polynesians to build canoes. Adam Cole, NPR News. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"STAR OF GLADNESS\")MAKAHA NI'IHAU: (Singing) Hokule'a, star of gladness. Oh, Hokule'a, star of gladness. KELLY MCEVERS, HOST:  In 1980, a dozen men sailed in a canoe from Tahiti to Hawaii. That's more than 2,000 miles. They didn't use a compass or a map or any modern instruments. They wanted to show that Hawaii could have been settled by Polynesian explorers who had intentionally made that same trip. And the canoe they took was named Hokule'a. That means star of gladness. And it helped revive interest in native Hawaiian culture. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:  Now Hokule'a is attempting an even longer journey. It's two years into a voyage around the entire globe. This month, it reached the East Coast of the United States, and NPR's Adam Cole went to see it on the Potomac River in Washington, D. C. ADAM COLE, BYLINE: As soon as I climbed aboard, apprentice navigator Kala Baybayan Tanaka took one look at my pink face and offered me sunscreen. KALA BAYBAYAN TANAKA: Do you need sunscreen? We've got a whole big thing of sunscreen. COLE: I should probably. TANAKA: You should put sunscreen on. COLE: I mean, oh, my gosh, look at this thing of sunscreen. It was a full gallon jug, a volume of sunscreen you would only buy if you planned to sail around the world. There isn't much shade to be found on Hokule'a. Its structure is based on traditional Polynesian designs. Two 60-foot canoes are joined by a central deck, topped with red sales. And the whole thing is lashed together with six miles of rope. Kala, who hails from Maui, sleeps under a strip of canvas along one edge. TANAKA: The front of the canoe is the wettest part of the canoe. That would be where I am. COLE: Kala's father is also on the voyage. Kalepa Baybayan is one of the primary navigators, and that comes with privileges. TANAKA: He sleeps in the very back of the canoe (laughter). COLE: It's dry there, a real luxury suite. KALEPA BAYBAYAN: You sleep on that board - right? - with an Igloo cooler underneath. And then there's that hard, yellow pad. But me, I get special treatment. I have an extra pad. COLE: Oh really? BAYBAYAN: (Laughter) Yeah. COLE: Kalepa earned his choice bunk through decades of study. He can navigate the open ocean using a Polynesian technique that's thousands of years old. He doesn't use any instruments. Instead, he builds a compass in his mind based on celestial landmarks. BAYBAYAN: Anything you can see with your eyes is a reference point. COLE: The rising and setting of certain stars, the sun, the moon, passing birds. And when none of those is available, he relies on waves. BAYBAYAN: There's a motion that the canoe makes as it climbs up over the wave, and you have to internalize that as a rhythm. And you kind of just feel the pulse of the canoe. COLE: To navigate like this without a GPS or instruments of any kind, you not only have to know your direction, you have to keep track of your speed and remember exactly where you came from. Forty years ago, when Hokule'a was preparing for its first voyage, no one on Hawaii had that skill. But a master navigator from Micronesia volunteered to share his knowledge. And that was how Kalepa began to study the art of wayfinding. He's been sailing on Hokule'a ever since, even as he raised his children. TANAKA: I actually started voyaging just to understand or get to know my dad better. COLE: At first, Kala didn't get her dad's obsession. TANAKA: I was a typical high-schooler thinking about what other people were thinking about me and boys and fashion. But until I started voyaging, it kind of felt unfulfilled, like, I just felt like there was something missing. COLE: And then Kalepa started to teach her about wayfinding. TANAKA: Which is so truly central to who we are and how we came to settle the islands that we did. COLE: The current voyage is meant to celebrate that Polynesian heritage and the connections between humans and a fragile natural world. For Kala, it's about connections she makes with people who are also trying to move forward while rediscovering their past. TANAKA: We want to know their struggles and also their successes and how we can carry on their story and share it with our kids back home.

He is a conservative cleric named Mawlawi Haibatullah. He was a chief justice handing down severe punishments back when the Taliban ruled Afghanistan. And he's apparently a compromise choice to avoid a power struggle by two younger candidates - one, the son of the Taliban's founder; the other, the son of the founder of a much more violent wing of the Taliban. Swirling around that drone strike that took out Haibatullah's predecessor is the ongoing question of Pakistan's relationship with the Taliban. We reached New York Times reporter Mujib Mashal in Kabul on a Skype line. That - apologies, you will hear faltering at points. The leadership of the Taliban has been living in the city of Quetta in Pakistan, across the border, for years. Why was he killed now? MUJIB MASHAL: For 14, 15 years of the war, yes, the Taliban leadership has always been based in Quetta. No matter what happened in the battlefields in Afghanistan, they had this sense of protection. Then once they crossed over to Pakistan, they were safe. And the United States did not go after their sanctuaries because they didn't want to anger Pakistan. They were hoping that at some point, they would reach some understanding with Pakistan that either Pakistan would bring them to negotiations or that Pakistan would crack down on them and it wouldn't have to get to this. But that got nowhere. So it seems like the pressure finally ran out. MONTAGNE: So when the Pakistani government complains that its sovereignty has been compromised, is that for domestic consumption or for show? MASHAL: It's really hard to tell. The Pakistanis may have helped the Americans target him. But on the other hand, there's a very public protest against the drone strike. So it is always hard to tell on part of the Pakistanis, just like it was when the Americans targeted bin Laden inPakistan. Did the Pakistanis help? Were the Pakistanis incompetent or complacent? But indications are that at least, the Pakistanis - they were frustrated with him over the past year because in a very public forum, he embarrassed the Pakistanis. Pakistanis were pledging in front of the Chinese, in front of the Americans, in front of the Afghans, that - we will bring this guy to talks. And he refused to come. So he was an embarrassment in a way. But whether an embarrassment worthy of a drone strike that violates Pakistani sovereignty - hard to tell. MONTAGNE: Does this, though, mean, potentially, that the Taliban can be brought to the peace table? MASHAL: So one thing that could give us an indication is when Mullah Mansour, the one who was just killed in a drone strike, became leader last summer, there were talks that he's pro-peace. He wants to negotiate. That didn't turn out to be true because in the Taliban ranks, there wasn't much of a desire for peace talks. So a leader is just an individual in a way. He can't go against the wave of feelings in the ranks. The same could be true with this new leader, especially when he's consolidating, especially when he's considered as not a heavyweight. He would have to go with the wave and what the movement feels. MONTAGNE: Is he still living in Pakistan, in Quetta, the town where the Taliban leadership has been living for all these years? MASHAL: All indications are that the new Taliban leader, Haibatullah, was selected in Quetta. The meetings and discussions to select him happened in Quetta. The only difference this time last summer, when there were these succession talks - it was out in the open. The meetings were very bold - large numbers - some of the Taliban leaders arriving in convoys of dozens and even hundreds of vehicles. After the drone strike, these meetings have been very low key, underground. That idea of their sanctuary being invulnerable - that has burst. That's no longer there.

The Iraqi military is trying to push ISIS out of the city with the help of a U. S. -led coalition. Today, the Pentagon said an ISIS commander was killed in Fallujah in an airstrike. But as more troops join the assault, some people are worried about protecting Baghdad. The city has seen a new wave of suicide bombings in recent days. Michael Knights wrote about this for Foreign Policy magazine, and I talked to him earlier today on Skype and asked what the latest battle of Fallujah means for Baghdad. MICHAEL KNIGHTS: Well, what it means is that some of the security forces that are typically protecting Baghdad will be concentrating on Fallujah instead. And it probably also means that ISIS is going to try to strike back harder in Baghdad to try and shift the effort away from Fallujah, where they're under severe pressure, and try and disrupt and distract the Iraqi government. MCEVERS: Talk about this wave of suicide attacks that we've seen in Baghdad recently. KNIGHTS: Well, ISIS has been focusing on the battlefront for a while now. But as they lose ground, they're starting to throw more and more suicide attacks and car bombs into Baghdad. And in the last month, ISIS says that it's killed 522 people in Baghdad in a series of 15 or so major bombings. MCEVERS: As these attacks continue in Baghdad and the city itself isn't as protected as it might've been before, how delicate is the situation in Baghdad? KNIGHTS: There's no chance that we're going to see ISIS physical control of areas of Baghdad. They've been pushed back from the outskirts of the city, and coalition air power would very rapidly respond to any major ISIS move towards the capital. But what we are likely to see is increasing numbers of suicide attacks and car bombs within Baghdad city with the aim of getting Shia militias to retaliate against the Sunni residents of Baghdad and the outlying areas to change the narrative of the war from of all of Iraq against ISIS to Sunnis and Shias against each other. MCEVERS: Which we've seen them do in the past. KNIGHTS: That's correct. MCEVERS: How likely is that to work? KNIGHTS: Well, that strategy is more likely to work today than it would've been three, four years ago. And there are two reasons for that. The first is that many of Baghdad's residents are really upset with the poor governance, with the lack of electricity, so Iraqis are angry. The other reason why it might work is because, since 2014, when Mosul fell, we have seen a great rise in the prominence of the Shia militias in Iraq. And they are very keen to take a wider role in the securing of Baghdad. MCEVERS: But ultimately, you see that the fight against ISIS is going well despite all of this. Despite the fact that Baghdad is vulnerable, you think the fight against ISIS is going well, and you see progress in the future. KNIGHTS: The campaign that's being fought by the international coalition and the Iraqis at the moment has a pretty modest objective, which is to try and roll back the level of violence and insecurity in Iraq to 2013, before ISIS was actually controlling cities like Fallujah, Ramadi or Mosul. But as you recall, security in Baghdad and Iraq in 2013 was actually pretty terrible, so it's a low bar for achieving our objectives in this first phase of the war against ISIS. After this, we have to restart the counterterrorism campaign, which is about removing them to their lowest ebb, as they were in, let's say, late 2010, when we destroyed all of their leadership and when they were really on the decline. MCEVERS: That's Michael Knights. He's with the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. We reached him on Skype. Thanks so much for joining us today. KNIGHTS: My pleasure.

The flow of weapons has been in the direction of Syria and Iraq but also in the direction of Western Europe, actually. Some of those weapons have been used during the terrorist attacks in Paris and Brussels. There is evidence that quite a number of them originated from Serbia and Bosnia. That's quite concerning.

The magazine turned over its entire issue to his report in August of 1946. It's considered a classic. John Hersey didn't try to second-guess the American decision to drop the atom bomb a year after it ended the deadliest war in history. Simply and plainly, he described the stories of six people who survived in a city where so many thousands died. Early in the evening of the day the bomb exploded, a Japanese naval launch moved slowly up and down the seven rivers of Hiroshima, John Hersey wrote, alongside the crowded sandspits on which hundreds of wounded lay. Mr. Tanimoto found about 20 men and women on the sandspit. He drove the boat onto the bank and urged them to get aboard. They did not move, and he realized that they were too weak to lift themselves. He reached down and took a woman by the hands, but her skin slipped off in huge glove-like pieces. He was so sickened by this that he had to sit down for a moment. Then he got out into the water and, though a small man, lifted several of the men and women, who were naked, into his boat. Their backs and breasts were clammy. And he remembered uneasily what the great burns he had seen during the day had been like, yellow at first, then red and swollen with skin sloughed off, and finally, in the evening, suppurated and smelly. He lifted the slimy living bodies out and carried them up the slope away from the tide. He had to keep consciously repeating to himself, these are human beings. It would be impossible to say what horrors were embedded in the minds of the children who lived through the day of the bombing in Hiroshima. On the surface, their recollections months after the disaster were of an exhilarating adventure. Toshio Nakamura, who was 10, was soon able to talk freely, even gaily, about the experience. And a few weeks before the anniversary, he wrote the following matter-of-fact essay for his teacher at Nobori-cho Primary School. The day before the bomb, I went for a swim. In the morning, I was eating peanuts. I saw a light. I was knocked to little sister's sleeping place. The neighbors were walking around burned and bleeding. Hataya-san told me to run away with her. I said I wanted to wait for my mother. We went to the park. A whirlwind came. At night, a gas tank burned and I saw the reflection in the river. We stayed in the park one night. Next day, I went to Taiko Bridge and met my girlfriends, Kikuki and Murakami. They were looking for their mothers, but Kikuki's mother was wounded and Murakami's mother, alas, was dead. SCOTT SIMON, HOST:  John Hersey went to Hiroshima in 1945 for The New Yorker magazine to talk to people who'd lived through the world's first nuclear bomb. The magazine turned over its entire issue to his report in August of 1946. It's considered a classic. John Hersey didn't try to second-guess the American decision to drop the atom bomb a year after it ended the deadliest war in history. Simply and plainly, he described the stories of six people who survived in a city where so many thousands died. Early in the evening of the day the bomb exploded, a Japanese naval launch moved slowly up and down the seven rivers of Hiroshima, John Hersey wrote, alongside the crowded sandspits on which hundreds of wounded lay. Mr. Tanimoto found about 20 men and women on the sandspit. He drove the boat onto the bank and urged them to get aboard. They did not move, and he realized that they were too weak to lift themselves. He reached down and took a woman by the hands, but her skin slipped off in huge glove-like pieces. He was so sickened by this that he had to sit down for a moment. Then he got out into the water and, though a small man, lifted several of the men and women, who were naked, into his boat. Their backs and breasts were clammy. And he remembered uneasily what the great burns he had seen during the day had been like, yellow at first, then red and swollen with skin sloughed off, and finally, in the evening, suppurated and smelly. He lifted the slimy living bodies out and carried them up the slope away from the tide. He had to keep consciously repeating to himself, these are human beings.

That's where we try to understand stories we'll be hearing more about by parsing some of the words associated with them. This week, our word is ministerial. That's in reference to a conference happening this week in San Francisco. Energy ministers from 23 countries and the European Union are gathering for the Clean Energy Ministerial. U. S. Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz will be there for the ministerial, or as he calls it, the CEM, for its initials - C-E-M. ERNEST MONIZ: C-E-M - Clean Energy Ministerial, right. MARTIN: Yeah, that's not that catchy, I have to be honest. ERNEST MONIZ: (Laughter). MARTIN: I spoke to Secretary Moniz in advance of the week's meetings. He says the meeting is a way to follow up on last year's Paris climate accords. The idea is to encourage the global use of technologies that will save energy and reduce pollution. ERNEST MONIZ: The CEM is promoting the expansive use of LED lighting across the world. MARTIN: And, Secretary Moniz says, the meeting is also looking for ways to encourage businesses to adopt energy efficiency guidelines. ERNEST MONIZ: What's called the ISO 50001 standard for energy efficiency in industry. MARTIN: The secretary also told me that governments still have an important role to play in developing new environmentally friendly technologies. ERNEST MONIZ: Absolutely, the - I think the government role is often undersold. For one thing, the basic science that underpins just about any technology development typically is developed through federal funding of research performed by universities, laboratories and our companies. MARTIN: You know, on the consumer end what you hear people say - it's the cost, even with LED lighting. I mean, the upfront cost for consumers is still high. So I'm just wondering if there's some thought about or if part of this conference is making clean energy affordable enough to compete in the marketplace, especially for people who aren't just invested in the idea or who aren't rich. ERNEST MONIZ: Well, I think we do have to recognize that in some of the technologies - like LEDs, like solar, like onshore wind - we have seen pretty remarkable cost reductions in the last six, seven years. And we have seen as well very substantial upticks in their deployment. LED costs have dropped probably 90 percent in the last six or seven years. And in solar, we have between 10 and 20 times as much deployment because costs have come down between 50 and 60 percent. So we're making a lot of progress. But I think that we still must focus on continuing deployment in the near term and continuing innovation for the longer term. MARTIN: You know, I do have to ask because on Thursday, Donald Trump made his first policy address on energy and the environment, very much in the news. And this is what he had to say. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)DONALD TRUMP: We're going to cancel the Paris climate agreement and stop all payments of the United States' tax dollars to U. N. global warming programs. MARTIN: So Mr. Secretary, I understand you wouldn't want to get into partisan politics. But I do have a factual question to ask you, which is that - does the president actually have that authority at this point? ERNEST MONIZ: While, first of all, let me reinforce the point that I will not comment on any candidate's position. But the Paris Agreement is not binding on targets. However, all the steps that have been taken are based upon existing authorities and following many-year processes spelled out in law to establish rules. If any president wants to change those, they will have to go through the same multi-year process to alter those. And so those will go forward unless, again, a new president and a new Congress decide to redo the entire processes of rulemaking. And I do not believe that there would be a lot of success in that attempt. So I believe what President Obama has put in place will keep us on our trajectory to meeting our Paris commitments. MARTIN: I understand that the meeting has not yet commenced, but I assume that you've been talking to your fellow ministers sort of all along. And I was just wondering what reaction - that you are getting as a representative of the United States in these talks to this kind of dialogue about canceling the United States' participation in it. Have you gotten any reaction to this so far? ERNEST MONIZ: In this arena - the climate talks - and in other areas that the Department of Energy is engaged in very heavily - like nuclear security, for example - I would say the current dialogue in the United States is causing some concern and some queries, shall we say, of my fellow ministers across the world. But again, I think the important response is as we just discussed. Here's what we are doing. Here is what is in place. Here is what is going to stay in place going forward into the next administration. MARTIN: That's Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz. He joined us from his offices at the Department of Energy in Washington, D. C. just days before he embarks on the Clean Energy Ministerial, a conference happening in San Francisco this coming week. Mr. Secretary, thank you so much for speaking with us. ERNEST MONIZ: Well, thank you Michel. I'm pleased to be here. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST:  Now it's time for our regular segment Words You'll Hear.

And before we get into the details, a warning - this is a story about violence against women and girls, including rape and murder. It runs about five minutes. In Brazil, a 16-year-old girl told police she was raped by more than 30 men. The alleged attack came to light through videos and pictures of her that surfaced on social media. In India, a 15-year-old girl was found dead hanged from a tree. Reports are that she was also raped and two men have been arrested. Our correspondence Lulu Garcia-Navarro in Rio de Janeiro and Julie McCarthy in New Delhi joined me earlier to discuss these two cases. I asked Lulu to begin by describing the issues being raised in Brazil. LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, BYLINE: Brazil is one of the most violent countries in the world, and for women in particular, there are deep roots here. When you speak to historians, they say that it goes back to slavery. I want to remind our listeners that Brazil was the last country in the Americas to ban slavery. It imported far more enslaved people than any other country in the region. Enslaved women, as you know, were considered property. They were used for sexual gratification, and when I've spoken to victims of gender violence here, there is one common theme. The men see their women as things, property. Hence why violence against women is often carried out by men the women already know. SHAPIRO: And, Julie, in India, there's been a lot of focus on where this victim came from. How does that figure into the larger conversation? JULIE MCCARTHY, BYLINE: Well, this girl came from Uttar Pradesh, which is a state next door. And all of that revived this terrible tragedy two years ago when two young girls were also found hanging from a tree suspected of being raped. It was a murky case, and a lot of times that's the problem here. These cases go unresolved. But you do often have a convergence of several things happening here. First of all, there's the caste system. Gang rape victims are oftentimes on the lowest rung of the social strata, namely the dalits, formerly known as untouchables. And add to that this pervasive, patriarchal attitude toward women which imbues women with the burden of carrying the honor of a family. So what does that mean? It means she gets caught in these honor games, and violence is perpetrated on her as a result of all that. SHAPIRO: Julie, in India, what role do the institutions that are supposed to protect these women play when you look at courts and other systems like that? MCCARTHY: Well, you know, after this 2012 case that made international headlines of a young woman who was gang raped on a moving bus in Delhi, there was a move to fast-track the courts, and penalties were strengthened for the crime of rape. But a defendant in Delhi still has an 83 percent chance of being acquitted. SHAPIRO: Lulu, what parallels do you see between what Julie is describing in India and what you are seeing in Brazil? GARCIA-NAVARRO: Yeah, I think there are quite a few parallels actually. Let's take this alleged rape. What's happened shows how weak the legal system is. The male lead investigator in this case that we've just been discussing has been replaced after he implied that the girl could've been consenting even though she was only 16 years old and there was apparently 30 men involved and she might've been drugged. And because this happened in a poor favela, there has been some implication that she, quote, unquote, \"asked for it. \" So we do see these parallels between these different areas where, you know, when you have these weak judicial systems, when you have attitudes entrenched with the people who are actually dealing with these cases, you do have results that are less than optimal. SHAPIRO: Is there a sense in either of these two countries that this case could be a turning point, a watershed moment? These cases are getting so much attention. Julie, let's start with you in India. MCCARTHY: I would have to say I do not think this is going to be a turning point, Ari. I think the soul-searching that began in 2012 has turned into a sort of numbness. I mean, you cannot pick up a newspaper in India today and not find an article about rape. And while that means the media has been sensitized, the public has become desensitized. And there's also a kind of silence that resonates out of the central government which critics say is also part of the problem. SHAPIRO: And, Lulu, in Brazil, do you think this case might actually make a change? GARCIA-NAVARRO: We've seen, as in India, big cases here that have happened in the past and very little has been done. There's a lot of outrage right now. There are promises from the highest levels of government that something will be done. But at the same time, this investigation, as I mentioned, is extremely chaotic. And it's really not clear that there will be the will to really tackle this on a broad systematic level in the way that really needs to happen to enact change. At the same time though, the fact that people are talking about it, they're sitting around their tables and discussing a culture of rape, as it's being called, I think is significant.

CHANG: So you were there at the beginning of the race. What was that like? BOWMAN: Well, Ailsa, they had a couple of hundred runners, and almost everyone here has a personal connection. They know someone who has died here. And you have to remember, these are young people. They're in their 20s and 30s. They've witnessed horrible losses.

CHANG: And I imagine you got a chance to meet a lot of people there. What conversations struck you? BOWMAN: Well, one of the soldiers I talked to is Major Kevin McCormick. He's a trainer. And we actually met him a few days ago for a story we're working on. And he was running in memory of his friend Tim McGovern, who was killed in Mosul, Iraq, on October 31, 2007 by a roadside bomb. Let's take a listen to what he said. KEVIN MCCORMICK: Went to college together. We actually lived together in an apartment for a year. You know, he was my best friend. Did a lot - just about everything together. He was actually - we were always neck and neck for number one and number two in our class. He was actually the better leader, but I had the better grades. He was a big guy, heart of gold. I know his family, great - I just got a email from his mom a couple - you know, about a week or so ago. So yeah, he definitely hasn't been forgotten. CHANG: Tom, most of the people now on the base are trainers, right, as opposed to combat troops. Is it a lot safer now there? BOWMAN: You know, Ailsa, it is a lot safer for most people. There are roughly 10,000 troops in Afghanistan, and most of them are working inside large bases. They're training Afghan forces. And there is the threat of a suicide attack, a rocket or mortar flying into the base. But that's very rare. But you do have the American special operators - Navy SEALs, Green Berets - going out on some missions, either working with either Afghan commandos or going after al-Qaida and ISIS. So they're still in harm's way. And we went out the other night, by the way, on American helicopters with Afghan commandos. They were heading into a Taliban-controlled area. There were a couple of Green Berets onboard as advisors. They didn't get off the helicopter to fight this time, but it does happen. And the last hostile death here was earlier this year. It was an American Green Beret, a Sergeant named Matthew McClintock of New Mexico. He was killed in an operation just west of here in a place called Marjah, a place that still has a lot of Taliban in an area that Afghans - and maybe some Americans - will be clearing out in the coming weeks and months.

He was a big guy, heart of gold. I know his family, great - I just got a email from his mom a couple - you know, about a week or so ago. So yeah, he definitely hasn't been forgotten. CHANG: Tom, most of the people now on the base are trainers, right, as opposed to combat troops. Is it a lot safer now there? BOWMAN: You know, Ailsa, it is a lot safer for most people. There are roughly 10,000 troops in Afghanistan, and most of them are working inside large bases. They're training Afghan forces. And there is the threat of a suicide attack, a rocket or mortar flying into the base. But that's very rare. But you do have the American special operators - Navy SEALs, Green Berets - going out on some missions, either working with either Afghan commandos or going after al-Qaida and ISIS. So they're still in harm's way. And we went out the other night, by the way, on American helicopters with Afghan commandos. They were heading into a Taliban-controlled area. There were a couple of Green Berets onboard as advisors. They didn't get off the helicopter to fight this time, but it does happen. And the last hostile death here was earlier this year. It was an American Green Beret, a Sergeant named Matthew McClintock of New Mexico. He was killed in an operation just west of here in a place called Marjah, a place that still has a lot of Taliban in an area that Afghans - and maybe some Americans - will be clearing out in the coming weeks and months. CHANG: That was NPR's Pentagon correspondent Tom Bowman. Tom, thanks so much for joining us. BOWMAN: You're welcome, Ailsa.", "section": "World", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.

That city has been fought over for more than a dozen years. U. S. forces captured it in 2003, only to see a new Iraqi government lose control. The U. S. had to take it again, after which in recent years Iraq's government lost control again to ISIS. Tim Arango, Baghdad bureau chief for The New York Times, is tracking the latest effort to retake the city. Hi Tim. TIM ARANGO: Hi, Steve. Good to be with you. INSKEEP: Glad you're with us from Baghdad. What were you able to see in the last day or two? ARANGO: Well, yesterday, we made a trip out to the areas around Fallujah, where they've been pressing this offensive on the city. And we spoke to some of the commanders and some of the soldiers there. What struck me was how much of an operation this is that's led by the militias. And there were some federal police there. They've taken up lots of positions around the city and our pounding it with artillery and rockets and all manner of things and waiting for the counterterror forces to actually come in and assault the city itself. INSKEEP: Help us understand this. You say the militias. You mean not the formal Iraqi army would be in the lead here, right? ARANGO: Absolutely. It really struck me yesterday when I finally got out there was just to not see any army, at least in the areas we were in. It was mostly militias. Some of these - there's a huge group. They're called the Popular Mobilization forces. Some of them are long-standing militias that are controlled by Iran. And others are new units that are more loyal to the Iraqi government that sprang up after the ISIS offensive in 2014. INSKEEP: How organized are they? ARANGO: The moral is great. I wouldn't say that they are as organized as the - as the American military, but they are making gains and they're communicating. And so far, they've had some successes there in clearing the areas around the city. INSKEEP: And you referred to a militia largely controlled by Iran. I presume you're talking about a Shiite-Muslim militia in a largely Sunni area. How is that working out? ARANGO: Yes, absolutely. All - most of the militias are Shia. The - a couple of the long-standing ones that answer to Iran have been central in this operation, one of them being Asaib Ahl al-Haq and the other one being Badr. It's raised huge concerns even that have rippled across the region. It's caused a stir in Saudi Arabia as they see what's happening, which is these militias surrounding a Sunni city. The militias say they're trying to get the civilians out. And they're trying to tamp down the sectarian tensions. But they're certainly there. INSKEEP: How exactly are they going about trying to move in and take the city? ARANGO: Well, they've tried to clear all these agricultural areas and all these other cities and really tighten a siege that has been underway actually for several months. Going back to December, there's been a siege of the city. Humanitarian organizations have raised concerns for many months about starvation inside the city. The refugee agencies say one - they've registered one single family from the center of Fallujah that's been able to escape. INSKEEP: When you talk about thousands of people in the city apparently not seizing whatever opportunity there might be to leave, do you have any communication or any sense of why they would stay in that ISIS-controlled area? ARANGO: My sense is the people in the center of the city cannot leave because ISIS will not let them leave. The ones that have been able to get out are in areas that have come under attack recently and have been able to escape as the fighting's going on. But in the center of the city, all the words that we get is that ISIS will not let them leave. And so they're terrified of leaving for being shot at by ISIS. INSKEEP: Meaning that they can't even get out of their homes to risk going across no-man's land. . . ARANGO: Exactly. . . INSKEEP: . . . To the other side. ARANGO: . . . Exactly. And the Iraqi government and the coalition, the Americans have pressed the people to put up white sheets on their windows to indicate that they're civilians. INSKEEP: Although you can see so many ways that would go wrong. ARANGO: Exactly. INSKEEP: Tim Arango of The New York Times, joining us by Skype. Thanks very much. ARANGO: Thanks Steve.

Yesterday, a correspondent described Iraq's effort to retake the city of Fallujah. He told us the forces challenging ISIS in Iraq include militias, quote, \"controlled by Iran. \" That's the phrase - controlled by Iran. U. S. Ambassador Robert Ford served in both Iraq and Syria. He is now with the Middle East Institute, and he's on the line. Good morning, Ambassador. ROBERT FORD: Good morning, Steve. INSKEEP: So how are these militias controlled by Iran? FORD: Well, Iran provides many - not all - but many of them with equipment, with funds. They provide training, and they even have advisors with them on the ground. INSKEEP: And why are they getting money from Iran and not the United States, which has certainly sent plenty of billions of dollars to Iraq over the years? FORD: The Iranians have had relationships with some of these militias that date back 30 years, to the war between Saddam Hussein and Iran - the first Gulf War. And now, the Iranians maintain and are even strengthening those relationships with those particular Iraqi Shia militias as a way of exerting Iranian influence in Baghdad and in Iraq. INSKEEP: And, of course, they've got a common religion there - Shia militias and Shia-dominated Iran. We've certainly heard about this before, ambassador - Iranian influence in Iraq. But what does it mean when you have this major offensive to try to beat ISIS - the United States has a big interest in this offensive - and it is Iranian-backed troops, Iranian-supplied troops, Iranian even directed troops who are doing the fighting? FORD: Well, it's not only Iranian-backed militias that are doing the fighting, although they are certainly doing some of the fighting. And the big concern is that these militias, in the past, have committed war atrocities in this battle against the Islamic State. Organizations such as Human Rights Watch have issued very detailed reports about those atrocities. And the fear is that such atrocities will aggravate secretary intentions and will actually help the Islamic State recruit new fighters. INSKEEP: Oh, just reminding people, we're talking about Shia militias and a Sunni population in the Fallujah area. And Sunnis, of course - or rather ISIS is dominated by Sunni Muslims. Now, do Iran and the United States really have the same basic interests here? FORD: Both the United States and Iran want to see the Islamic State contained and eliminated. But the United States' goal in Iraq over the long-term is to help Iraqis build a strong state, whereas the Iranian goal in Iraq is to ensure that there is a weak government in Baghdad under heavy Iranian influence. And so the Iranians are using these particular Shia militias that it helps - it is using them to create, if you will, Steve, a sort of state within the state. The Iranians did the same thing in Lebanon with Hezbollah. INSKEEP: Just about 10 seconds left, ambassador. Does it bother you, as someone who's served in Iraq and Syria, that the U. S. would be leaning on Iran in this way? FORD: I worry that we end up indirectly helping a side which is committing war atrocities and that will facilitate the Islamic State's recruitment when we need to undermine Islamic State recruitment. INSKEEP: Former U. S. Ambassador Robert Ford, now with the Middle East Institute. Thanks very much. FORD: My pleasure, Steve. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  Let's follow up on a phrase about Iraq.

S. border again. They're fleeing gang violence. And they're coming in numbers that rival the immigration crisis in the summer of 2014. The federal government has spent almost two years making special efforts to stop the flow. Yet, the numbers of migrant families and children apprehended along the U. S. border have doubled over this time last year. NPR's John Burnett reports. JOHN BURNETT, BYLINE: Nothing seems to deter the onslaught of Central American immigrants. Immigration officials opened controversial family detention camps in South Texas. They publicized immigration roundups earlier this year with more to come. There's a big U. S. public relations campaign in Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala telling people they're not welcome. And recently, Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson traveled to Central America to deliver the message in person. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JEH JOHNSON: I am here today to send the message that our borders in the United States are not open to a regular migration. UNIDENTIFIED CHILD: (Foreign language spoken). BURNETT: Yet they're not getting the message. You see it here in the parish hall of Sacred Heart Catholic Church in McAllen, Texas. Every day, it's full of young mothers and children who've been released by the Border Patrol. They get a shower, clean clothes, a hot meal and supplies for the journey North. Sister Norma Pimentel is director at Regional Catholic Charities, which runs the shelter. NORMA PIMENTEL: You know, it's like 50, 60, 100, 200 backpacks that we need every day, 200 or 50 or 80 deodorants or shoes. Can you imagine coming up with 50, 60, 80 pairs of shoes every day? You know, it's amazing. BURNETT: Immigration officials don't seem worried about a repeat of the humanitarian crisis on the border that made international news two years ago. Caught unawares, the Border Patrol packed dirty, bewildered young immigrants elbow-to-elbow into frigid cells. Today, the government has new family holding facilities. And unaccompanied kids are sent to cheery church camps. Yet the numbers are daunting. From last October to March, agents made an average of 330 apprehensions of Central Americans a day. According to an analysis by the Pew Research Center, that's a 100 percent increase over the same time period a year earlier. While the Homeland Security Department does not seem alarmed by the swelling numbers, their own border officers are clearly frustrated. Two weeks ago, the agents' union president Brandon Judd testified at a congressional hearing. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BRANDON JUDD: What happens is if you are arrested in the United States and you ask for any sort of asylum, what we do is we will process you and we will walk you right out our front door, give you a pat on the back and say, welcome to the United states. And they're good to go. BURNETT: The Border Patrol ends up releasing the vast majority of family members of apprehends because U. S court rulings restrict its ability to detain them. Asylum applicants are allowed to hop a bus to join family elsewhere in the U. S. where they await their hearing. Currently, nearly a half-million cases are backlogged in U. S. immigration courts with an average wait time of almost two years, though the government is trying to expedite the recent arrivals. Critics call this policy of catch and release de facto amnesty. Chris Cabrera is a Border Patrol officer and union official in South Texas. He says his member agents are distracted by all the families surrendering to seek asylum when they should be chasing drug and human traffickers. CHRIS CABRERA: Our agents are so caught up with rounding up the ones that are turning themselves in, corralling them and getting them to the station, that we don't have adequate resources to get the ones that are trying to get away. BURNETT: A top Homeland Security official in Washington, speaking on background, told NPR the agency is continuing the programs it has in place. These include deporting recent arrivals, helping Central American countries fight crime, arresting human smugglers and giving money to Mexico to stop the immigrants in transit. Our message has not changed, the official stressed. Don't come. If you do and your amnesty claim is denied, we will remove you. UNIDENTIFIED CHILD: (Speaking Spanish). WENDY VILLANUEVA: (Speaking Spanish). BURNETT: No one seems to pay much attention to the government's tough talk inside the Catholic immigrant shelter on the border. Illegal crossers risk the journey from Central America because they know they'll be admitted, not locked up like immigrants from Mexico. VILLANUEVA: (Speaking Spanish). BURNETT: Wendy Villanueva is 21 from Honduras traveling with her toddler daughter. She says they fled Colon province when gangsters extorted her small clothing business and threatened to kill her if she didn't pay up. Villanueva and her daughter took buses to the Texas-Mexico border and surrendered to U. S. agents on the International Bridge at Brownsville. They're headed to North Carolina to join her mother and sisters who are also seeking amnesty. VILLANUEVA: (Speaking Spanish).

As Iraqi security forces make advances, many civilians, under the cover of night, have risked their lives and fled. So far, 566 families have made it to displacement camps in neighboring cities, where aid workers, like Elisabeth Koek of the Norwegian Refugee Council, are receiving them. She's learning more about what it means to live under ISIS rule. ELISABETH KOEK: Around me, I see mostly people who are relieved. I was in the camp, and I had a 6-year-old boy who was given our basic kit of food and he just burst into tears at the sight of bread. He hadn't seen bread in five or six months. People have been surviving on rotting rice or dates or a little bit of yogurt. The people have not had access to any kind of safe and clean drinking water in months. People were telling me about drinking water from agricultural wells where dead carcasses were floating about. There's lack of electricity. This woman was telling me that they were buying bottles of crude oil and putting a date on top of it with a piece of string, and then that's what they would use for lighting. CHANG: A candle made out of a date. KOEK: Essentially. A candle made out of a date and crude oil. CHANG: Many of the families who've made it to these displacement camps are actually from the outskirts of Fallujah. Why haven't more people been able to escape Fallujah proper? KOEK: ISIS prevents them from escaping. That's very clear. People are telling us, we are too scared to flee. What we know is that there are about 50,000 civilians who are trapped inside the city with war raging on their doorsteps essentially, and the fear is the dominating factor. I think people want to escape but they can't. I heard one story of a family where ISIS found out that they wanted to escape, and they came and they beat the husband and told the family that if they wanted to escape they would get killed. So people are terrified, terrified to escape. CHANG: And what about the issue of water? We're talking about temperatures reaching 111 degrees Fahrenheit this week. Has supplying enough water been a challenge at these displacement camps? KOEK: Yes, and I'm glad you asked about that. Water is our biggest concern for people. At the moment, NRC - the Norwegian Refugee Council, for whom I work - are able to provide at least five liters of safe drinking water per person, per day. And that is the bare minimum that a person needs for survival. But it's becoming more and more challenging as more and more people are coming in, and we are expecting the number to rise as the fighting intensifies. So our biggest concern at the moment is getting water, and it is difficult for us because of funding shortages. CHANG: Have you met any families, anyone, who has escaped, whose story has really stayed with you? KOEK: Yes. I met this family, and I found it really difficult to listen to - there was a woman telling me a story about how they had to run out of their house. She would send her husband first, over to the next street corner to see if it's safe, and the rest of the family would follow. And then he would run out to the next street corner to see if it was safe. And I just pictured myself in a situation like that and sending a loved one to check if the next street corner was safe and not knowing if I would be able to catch up with him or not. CHANG: That was Elisabeth Koek talking to us from Baghdad. She's an aid worker with the Norwegian Refugee Council, a group helping civilians who have escaped Fallujah.

David Miliband argues that it is time for a dramatic shift in how the world handles refugees. He is a former British foreign secretary and heads the nonprofit International Rescue Committee and joins us to discuss this idea. Welcome to the program. DAVID MILIBAND: Good evening. SHAPIRO: You argue for getting rid of refugee camps altogether. Explain how that would work. MILIBAND: My argument is that the refugee crisis is not just one of scale - 20 million refugees last year by the last count - but also of the fundamental purpose and nature of the humanitarian system. The humanitarian aid system was built to deal with short-term displacement. And so people were kept in camps - the idea was for a limited member of years - and then they'd go back home. What we face now is that the average civil war in Somalia or Afghanistan can last for 25, 30 - the actual average is 37 years. And that means we have to rethink the camp model. As it happens, many refugees - about 60 percent - are flocking to urban areas anyway, but those that are left in camps, like the largest camp in the world, Dadaab refugee camp in Kenya with 360,000 people - it's not a future for people there if we're expecting them to be there for another 25 years. SHAPIRO: How do you actually incorporate hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of people into an already densely occupied place like Nairobi or like Istanbul? MILIBAND: Well, Istanbul, to take that as an example - it's a city. There's about 2-and-a-half million refugees in Turkey, and Istanbul has about 400,000 refugees. They have flocked there from Syria. And obviously there's an economic challenge. And the best methods of refugee integration are pretty simple, really. You ensure that their kids get taught the local language so they can go to school. The adults get the opportunity to work. And the city gets support for its infrastructure - its housing, its schools, its water services. So it's a basic deal that, in return for hosting large numbers of refugees outside camps, there are work permits to allow them to contribute to the local economy, and there's international financing to make sure it's a win-win for the local population as well as for the refugees. SHAPIRO: You also suggest giving refugees cash rather than the typical kind of humanitarian aid that has been the practice up until now. Explain how that would work. MILIBAND: Obviously the images that you see on television are of refugees being given a tent to sleep in or being given a fleece to keep them warm in winter or a new pair of socks. All the evidence is that when refugees are displaced for a long time, they need more. And we've measured the impact of giving a dollar to Syrian refugees in Lebanon. And the remarkable fact is that it doesn't just empower the refugees to choose what they want to spend on. It also generates over two dollars for the local economy, and refugees can be seen as residents, not just as people who are dependent on handouts. SHAPIRO: The kind of dramatic shift that you're describing requires something close a global consensus and certainly buy-in from countries that currently have refugee camps. How likely do you think that is? MILIBAND: I think your reference to a global consensus is really important, and there are three core elements that are really fundamental to getting this right. First and most obviously, as long as civil wars are raging in Somalia, Afghanistan, Syria, you need proper peacekeeping, proper peacemaking, proper diplomacy. The second thing that's very important is that refugees and those displaced by conflict get proper help, including opportunities to work for heads of household, including women-headed households. The third thing - it can't just be left on the shoulders of the poorest countries in the world. Countries like the U. S. , countries in Europe, Canada - that so-called resettlement of refugees, the most vulnerable refugees - into the world's richest countries is an essential part of a full-spectrum approach to this global problem.

Chinese factories have been blamed for the death of New England's once vibrant shoe industry. Now in a twist on that global trade story, Chinese consumers are helping to keep some of New England's last shoe factories afloat. Turns out, the Chinese have a thing for American-made New Balance sneakers. Murray Carpenter reports. MURRAY CARPENTER, BYLINE: In an old brick mill building in Skowhegan, Maine, production line workers are cutting, stitching and gluing New Balance sneakers. The company calls them lifestyle shoes, better known for their looks than their athletic performance. RAYE WENTWORTH: The lifestyle shoes have really been on fire, especially with a younger market that we've been after for years. It's more of an iconic fashion statement. CARPENTER: Raye Wentworth is the plant manager. She's watching a steady stream of New Balance 1400s being assembled. They're classic-looking sneakers in grey swede and blue nylon with the letter N prominent on the sides. WENTWORTH: The demand is there, and we have 285 five people that proudly make them every day. CARPENTER: Another central Maine New Balance plant employs 365 people. The two factories will make more than a million pairs of sneakers this year. And the company also makes them in Massachusetts. And they are all labeled made in USA, which make them more valuable to many consumers in China. JIANG YUJUN: (Foreign language spoken). CARPENTER: Jiang Yujun is an office worker in Beijing.

John Frisbie of the U. S. -China Business Council says that perception of quality is part of what's driving the demand for exports to China. And it's not just shoes. JOHN FRISBIE: It's been the fastest-growing market for American exports since China joined the WTO, the World Trade Organization, in 2001. So U. S. exports to China - we're talking manufactured goods, we're talking agricultural products, services - U. S. exports to China have grown over 600 percent in the last 15 years. CARPENTER: U. S. exports to China are still dwarfed by our imports. And Frisbie says heavy taxes and other market barriers make American products expensive in China. But he says China's fast-growing middle class is now estimated 300 million people, and that creates a lot of consumer demand. Steve Gardner is a manager of the lifestyle division at New Balance headquarters in Boston. He wouldn't disclose the percentage of its U. S. -made shoes being exported to China. But he says demand is strong all over the world. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)STEVE GARDNER: Whether it's Europe, the U. S. , Asia, I think there has been an incredible embrace that, in the first case, probably came from the Japanese market much earlier than a lot of the rest of the world.

The Zetas and the powerful Gulf Cartel have been waging a brutal battle for control of this northern border state for years. The burned-out buildings and a 30-foot black monument erected in a nearby park warned the Zetas not to return. But lately, the focus of the cartels' war isn't just in the towns along the smuggling corridor leading to the U. S. It also appears to be in politics. Take the battle for the mayor here in tiny Hidalgo. WENCESLAO ZUNIGA VAZQUEZ: (Speaking Spanish). KAHN: At a recent rally, supporters greet candidate Wenceslao Zuniga Vazquez, the town's elementary school principal. Everyone here calls him profe, the professor. He tells the crowd he's dropping out of the race.

Extortion and robberies are so rampant, motorists travel the state's highways in police-protected convoys. LETICIA DE LEON: (Speaking Spanish).

Zuniga's voting for a smaller party's candidate, who campaigns around the state handing out brooms to sweep away what he says are the rat-like politicians. She blames the ruling PRI party for the state's problems. The party hasn't lost a governor's race in 86 years. Polls show, for the first time, the opposition PAN party has a chance at winning.

But this is Tamaulipas, and nearly every candidate seems to be their own questionable credentials to the race. Cabeza de Vaca was arrested as a teen in Texas for stealing guns. And more recently, according to the newspaper Reforma, he purchased a Mexico City luxury apartment worth nearly $3 million. Who takes Tamaulipas may all depend on voter turnout, which polls say will be low due to fear of violence. The army just announced it's sending 2,000 troops to the state by Sunday - voting day.

KAHN: \"The winds of change are blowing in Tamaulipas,\" PAN party candidate Francisco Garcia Cabeza de Vaca yells to thousands of supporters at his campaign-closer in Reynosa. DE VACA: (Speaking Spanish). KAHN: \"We will make history, and throw the PRI out,\" the candidate screams. But this is Tamaulipas, and nearly every candidate seems to be their own questionable credentials to the race. Cabeza de Vaca was arrested as a teen in Texas for stealing guns. And more recently, according to the newspaper Reforma, he purchased a Mexico City luxury apartment worth nearly $3 million. Who takes Tamaulipas may all depend on voter turnout, which polls say will be low due to fear of violence. The army just announced it's sending 2,000 troops to the state by Sunday - voting day.

Now forces with Libya's U. N. -backed unity government are advancing on the ISIS stronghold of Sirte on the Mediterranean coast. Anthony Loyd is a reporter with The Times of London, and he just got back from Libya last night. And he joins us now by Skype. Welcome to the show. ANTHONY LOYD: Hi, Kelly. MCEVERS: You write that there are now thousands of ISIS militants in Libya, mainly, as we said, in the city of Sirte. Who are they, and how and when did they get there? LOYD: Kelly, there are several layers around two or three different groups. You've got Libyan Islamist groups who coalesced around some veteran al-Qaida fighters returning from Afghanistan and Yemen. Then on top of those, you've got foreign fighters. You've got, more recently, Islamic State carders sent over from Iraq and from Syria and a final generation of foreign fighters who have come in via Khartoum across the desert to join Islamic States in Libya. So there's about three different groupings that have now coalesced together. MCEVERS: And they're coalesced in Sirte, which was, we should say, the final stronghold of Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi. He was born there. It was the place that he held out to the end. He was killed there. How is it that they ended up in Sirte? What's the attraction of Sirte? LOYD: The attraction of Sirte is manifold. First of all, Sirte represents the natural fault line in Libya between East and West. You've got divided security establishments on either side of the country. And Sirte is right in between the two, and it's sort of controlled by nobody. You've got tribes there who were loyal to Gaddafi who do not like or appreciate what happened in the revolution, and subsequently they feel marginalized, disenfranchised, disillusioned and angry. So that's the natural, fertile bed for Islamicist terror terror groups to sort of seed themselves in. You've got road access to the south of the country and out elsewhere sea access as well. It's a good place for terror groups to seed themselves. MCEVERS: And you have interviewed people who've fled Sirte. What have they told you about what it's like to live under ISIS rule? LOYD: They said ISIS started turning up in 2014. But even then, they were quite friendly until they felt confident enough that they had enough numbers there, and then it became more Draconian. Then you got public executions in the squares or in the central roundabout. You got bodies hung up on gibbets or scaffolding for two or three days after execution. You got people put in prison and beaten for a whole lot of smaller crimes. So it's different stages of suppression of the local population. MCEVERS: And now, as we said, Libyan forces with this unity government are now closing in on Sirte. And you write that British and U. S. special operations forces are helping in this fight. How are they doing that? LOYD: British and American special forces have been present in Libya for some time, and that's been very sort of publicly acknowledged by authorities from various countries. MCEVERS: Right. LOYD: They're doing a number of things. First of all, they're training some Libyan fighters from selected militia groups. But also they are helping destroy some of the suicide vehicles which are sent by Islamic State against Libyan fighters and helping the Libyan militias coordinate with an upgraded intelligence picture and a battle plan as well. MCEVERS: Is your sense that this involvement by Western special forces is enough? I mean, is that what it's going to take to defeat ISIS in Libya? LOYD: No. It's a positive trend, their involvement on the battlefield. But ultimately, ISIS in Libya will always exist until there's an overall political solution in Libya which harnesses East and West one government. We're a long way from seeing the end of Islamic State in Libya. MCEVERS: That's Anthony Loyd of The Times of London. We reached him by Skype. Thanks so much. LOYD: Thanks, Kelly.

Fifty-thousand civilians are estimated to be trapped in Fallujah. There's little food. People drink contaminated river water to survive. About a thousand families have managed to escape to displacement camps nearby. Becky Bakr Abdulla of the Norwegian Refugee Council has met with some of the families and she joins us now from Erbil, Iraq. Thanks so much for being with us. BECKY BAKR ABDULLA: Thank you for having me. SIMON: How have people escaped the city? Do you know? Can you say? ABDULLA: Yeah, so from Fallujah city itself, the families are telling us that they've escaped during nighttime. They wait until it's dark. They're only bringing the clothes off their backs and some have managed to bring their ID cards. Other than that, they're not carrying anything with them. They're running. Many are running barefoot in order not to be heard. They're hiding in big drainage pipes. They're swimming across the river. They're carrying elderly, sick and children with them. Many have escaped 15 to 16 families together. We've also received reports on people that have died when they've managed to escape. Among others, one father carrying his two sons, one in each arm, who stepped on a land mine and died on his way out, hoping for safety. SIMON: The U. N. estimates there are 20,000 children who are trapped in Fallujah. What do you know about them? ABDULLA: So what we know about all the civilians that are trapped inside Fallujah is that, like I mentioned, they don't have access to anything. I mean, we have to remember that the last time any humanitarian aid accessed the city was September - late September last year. So they're basically surviving on whatever it is that they can find. Most of it is food for their crops and animals, such as dried dates that they've now started eating themselves. And they're telling us about constant rockets and bombings and shootings. They're not sleeping. They're afraid of their lives every single minute of the day. And children are kept inside. They're not attending school anymore, obviously. At the same time, the Norwegian Refugee Council, we don't have any direct access into the city. And with the situation being so extremely fluid, it's difficult for us to comment on exactly what is going on in there. SIMON: And how does the Norwegian Refugee Council help to care for people once they get to a displacement camp? ABDULLA: Right. So we're located around 30 kilometers away from Fallujah, in an area in Anbar called Amiriyat al-Fallujah. That's the first safe spot that these people come to. Now bear in mind, it's not very safe at all. We're only 12 minutes away from the front lines. But compared to what these people have been through, what they're telling us when they arrive during night, we're so extremely relieved. We never thought that we would make it to safety. This is almost like a dream for us. One woman told me that my children started laughing so loudly when they saw tomatoes and cucumbers because they've not had that for so many months. Another child, a 6-year-old boy - and this is heartbreaking - started crying when one of my team members offered him a piece of bread. So yeah, they've been through an extremely tough situation, a very, very dire situation indeed. SIMON: And it's hot there too, in those camps, isn't it? ABDULLA: Oh, yeah. I mean, here in Iraq, temperatures can go over 50 degrees Celsius. It's smoking hot. It's very, very basic, the aid we're able to provide these people. Some of them only have a tent. They don't even have mattresses because, I mean, bear in mind, Fallujah comes on top of an already unfolding humanitarian crisis in Iraq. We already have 3. 4 million people that are internally displaced in this country. This is when we can't turn our backs on the Iraqi people. SIMON: It strikes me that your camps are awfully close to the front lines. ABDULLA: Yeah, so NRC, the Norwegian Refugee Council, is one of very few humanitarian organizations that have access into Anbar at all. We've been there for over a year's time now providing assistance to displaced families from all across Anbar. And, I mean, I have to say whilst on duty, we ourselves are hearing, you know, the bombings. We're seeing the smoke. But that's as close as we've managed to get to the people of Fallujah. Right now, there's two things we're asking for. One, for all the worrying parties to provide the civilians inside Fallujah safe exits out so that they can manage to get across those 30 minutes away where we and some other humanitarian actors are present. But two, provide us with more funding so that we can give them the need - the aid that they so desperately need.

President Carter, Welcome to the program once again. JIMMY CARTER: It's a pleasure to be on NPR. Thank you. SIEGEL: This must be a gratifying moment for you, I assume. CARTER: Well, it's very pleasing to me. We've come from 3. 5 million cases down to just two cases so far this year, you know, is all we've had confirmed. And so we're making good progress. SIEGEL: Can you tell us about how you first became aware of this disease and what it was that moved you to spend so many years supporting efforts to eradicate it? CARTER: My former drug czar, Dr. Peter Bourne - after he left the White House, became assistant secretary general of the United Nations. And they put him in charge of a decade of water. It came down to the (unintelligible) to give us a report on diseases caused by impure water. And he talked about Guinea worm, and I decided that at time since no one else was addressing the disease that the Carter Center should take this on. So we began to consult with the Centers for Disease Control. Dr. Don Hopkins was there. And eventually he came over to the Carter Center to take charge of the program and later became in charge of all of our health programs. SIEGEL: Eradicating Guinea worm, as we heard from our reporter Jason Beaubien, involved getting people to change their habits especially people who were in extreme pain to change what they did. Do you think that's a taller order than getting a population, say, inoculated or medicated for something? CARTER: Well, it's much more difficult because there's no medicine to treat Guinea worm. And if they would filter all that water that they drink out of that filthy pond and then will not go into the water when they have a Guinea worm emerging, then in a year's time if everybody in the village does that, then the Guinea worm is gone for that particular village. We had 23,600 villages that we had to contact and teach each one of them how to do this. And that's what's taken 30 years. SIEGEL: As you said, you learned about this disease via a project about water. And Guinea worm would be one of many diseases that remind us how problematic humanity's relationship to water can be. That's the big problem it seems. CARTER: That's true. It's getting more serious every year because the population is increasing. And quite often from irrigation purposes and otherwise, the streams have (unintelligible) to provide drinking for people and for other purposes - and now shrinking up so with smaller streams and more people, the competition for water is going to get increasingly more intense in years to come. SIEGEL: And when we speak of, say, eradication of Guinea worm, the worm isn't extinct. Is it possible that there could be a recurrence of this disease? CARTER: No, unless a particular waterhole which has to be stagnant water has guinea worm gone then the only way it can be revived in that particular area is for someone with Guinea worm coming out of their body to just wade out into the water and let more eggs be planted. So we've never had a case when we completely eradicated from a village of Guinea worm recurring unless some stranger comes from a distant place and wades out into the water with Guinea worm. But the villagers know to keep people out of the water. And once they do that, the Guinea worm is gone forever. SIEGEL: I've read that river blindness - which is also caused by a parasitic worm and transmitted by flies - that's next on your hit list. Where does that effort stand? CARTER: Well, we've now taken the leadership in the world in doing away with river blindness in particular countries. We've been quite successful in Latin America. We've now moved our effort to Africa. In the past, what the total world effort was with river blindness was just to eliminate for one year at a time. And the river blindness eggs stayed in the body. But now we have taken on the task of eliminating river blindness in individual countries or entire sections of the world. And so we've shifted from just controlling the disease every year to eliminating it completely. And we're making very good progress on that. SIEGEL: President Carter, thanks for talking with us. And, by the way, speaking of health, you're doing well, feel OK? CARTER: I feel just fine. Yes, I'm doing quite well. We're checking very carefully to see if the brain cancer comes back. But so far there's been no sign of it. I just want to get rid of the last case of Guinea worm during my lifetime. That's what I'm trying to do. SIEGEL: Well, it's - at the number of cases this year, it's looking pretty good. CARTER: It is looking good so far. SIEGEL: President Jimmy Carter, thanks for talking with us.

CARTER: Well, we've now taken the leadership in the world in doing away with river blindness in particular countries. We've been quite successful in Latin America. We've now moved our effort to Africa. In the past, what the total world effort was with river blindness was just to eliminate for one year at a time. And the river blindness eggs stayed in the body. But now we have taken on the task of eliminating river blindness in individual countries or entire sections of the world. And so we've shifted from just controlling the disease every year to eliminating it completely. And we're making very good progress on that. SIEGEL: President Carter, thanks for talking with us. And, by the way, speaking of health, you're doing well, feel OK? CARTER: I feel just fine. Yes, I'm doing quite well. We're checking very carefully to see if the brain cancer comes back. But so far there's been no sign of it. I just want to get rid of the last case of Guinea worm during my lifetime. That's what I'm trying to do. SIEGEL: Well, it's - at the number of cases this year, it's looking pretty good. CARTER: It is looking good so far. SIEGEL: President Jimmy Carter, thanks for talking with us.

I know, the bond market. Just stay with me here. The yield on the 10-year year bond issued by the German government fell into negative territory for the first time. And here's what that means. If you bought one of the bonds and held onto it, you would actually lose money over time. NPR's Jim Zarroli reports the drop in rates shows the growing nervousness about where the global economy is headed. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: It is by now a familiar problem. Eight years after the subprime mortgage crisis, many of the richest and most developed countries of the world remain mired in slow growth, says MIT economist Simon Johnson. SIMON JOHNSON: The fundamental facts of Japan and much of the Euro area are that growth is disappointing. Growth is low. Investors do not feel there are attractive places to put their money with good return to reasonable risk. ZARROLI: Recently there's been something else to be worried about. Next week the United Kingdom will vote on whether to leave the European Union, and recent polls suggest the vote will be a lot closer than it once seemed. That's introducing a big, new level of uncertainty into the global economy, so a lot of investors are doing what they always do. They're pouring their money into government bonds. David Blanchflower is a professor of economics at Dartmouth. DAVID BLANCHFLOWER: People are looking for safety. They're looking for places to park their money. ZARROLI: This surging demand for government bonds is driving down interest rates in the United States. And in some wealthy countries such as Sweden, Denmark, Switzerland and now Germany, bond rates have actually fallen below blue zero, Simon Johnson says. JOHNSON: We have some countries - the most notable are in Europe - where the investors are willing to buy bonds that have a negative yield so you don't get compensated for putting your money into these bonds. You actually - it's like paying a little tax, if you like. ZARROLI: Buying a bond that's guaranteed to lose you money may seem like a pretty crazy thing to do. It's actually not as irrational as it seems. Money market economist Tom Simons of Jefferies and Company says a lot of bonds are bought by big institutional investors, and they don't usually hold onto them very long. They sell them. TOM SIMONS: I think that when an investor buys, say, a 10-year bond at a negative yield, what they're thinking is that, I'll hold this for a short period of time, let all of the period of uncertainty sort of dissipate. And then at that point, I'll probably get out of it. ZARROLI: As long as rates are falling, investors who sell bonds can still make a profit. The risk is that something unexpected can happen. Rates could suddenly reverse course, and a lot of big investors could lose huge amounts of money, Tom Simon says. SIMONS: One might assume that if the outlook brightened just in general that there would be a mass exodus from the negative yielding assets and that everybody would be selling at the same time. And if that happens, then losses could be substantial. ZARROLI: Last week one of the most famous bond investors in the world, Bill Gross, tweeted a warning about the bond market. He said there are now $10 trillion worth of negative rate bonds on the market. This is a supernova that will explode one day, he said. He later appeared to walk back the remarks a bit. In fact, risks are nothing new in the bond market. Unexpected changes in interest rates mean big losses for some investors and big gains for others. Tom Simons says the fact that negative rates are growing more common could add a psychological element to the market. It could make some investors more nervous. They could react in ways they never have before. But no one knows for sure because the world of negative rates is still such a new one. Jim Zarroli, NPR News, New York.

In the Arctic Circle, warming temperatures and melting ice are raising the stakes over valuable resources. The U. S. currently chairs the Arctic Council, which is made up of the world's eight northernmost - nations. As NPR's Jackie Northam reports, the U. S. took over the chair at a time when relations with Russia were rock bottom. JACKIE NORTHAM, BYLINE: The chairmanship of the Arctic Council rotates every two years, and the U. S. assumed that role in April 2015. Admiral Robert Papp, the U. S. special representative for the Arctic, recalls the atmosphere surrounding his inauspicious start. ROBERT PAPP: We have just placed sanctions, rightly so, on Russia for their aggression in the Ukraine. So we don't have a normal situation, and there is tension. NORTHAM: Papp, speaking at the Council on Foreign Relations, says what made it more challenging was the Arctic Council works by consensus. The eight member countries, all Arctic nations, need to agree on any decision. Papp needed Russia to sign off on the program, what areas the U. S. was planning to focus on during its chairmanship, so he went to Moscow to meet with Russian Arctic specialists. PAPP: I have met some very reasoned, sober, professional individuals that work the Arctic issues within Russia. Their senior Arctic official gave us the most thorough critique of our chairmanship program of any of the other countries, gave us a lot of suggestions for improvement. NORTHAM: The Arctic Council is now one of the few arenas where the U. S. and Russia cooperate, says Brigadier General Stephen Cheney, CEO of the American Security Project. That's because countries involved want the council to focus on science and research, think such as fisheries and climate change, and not military issues. STEPHEN CHENEY: The scientists and the engineers and the researchers really have an aversion to militarizing or even talking about the military or security within the Arctic Council. NORTHAM: Cheney, who's also a member of the State Department's International Security Advisory Board on the Arctic, says as a former Marine, it seemed reasonable to him that the Arctic Council should address issues such as territorial claims and Russia's military buildup in the region. CHENEY: But I now have been convinced bringing the security aspect into it would not be a good thing. They fear if you brought into into their agenda, it would dilute not only their agenda but countries would leave and would not anticipate. So it has worked on the science and research side. And there's been a lot of cooperation. NORTHAM: The U. S. created several priorities for its two-year tenure, such as addressing the impact of climate change. Malte Humpert, the strategic director of The Arctic Institute, says the U. S. won't be making any headlines during its tenure because the council earlier passed several big-ticket agreements. MALTE HUMPERT: Under the U. S. chairmanship, we have not had any major agreements just because they put together the search and rescue agreement a few years ago. They put together the oil spill prevention and cleanup response agreement. So there's not a lot of headline-grabbing action left to do. NORTHAM: But Papp says it's a fast-changing environment in the Arctic that's attracting people who want access to the resources, whether it be for mining, fishing or tourism. PAPP: We are generally in what I would, as a sailor, call a stern chase, which means your constantly trying to overtake the entrepreneurs who are up there. Business people aren't going to wait for some of the things that we're doing within our Arctic Council business.

CHRIS SHELDRICK: Even in the capital city, Ulaanbaatar, there aren't really street names that people use in everyday life. People tend to use directions. Or they say, you know, by the blue pearl building, the fourth lamppost on the left. MARTIN: That is Chris Sheldrick. He is co-founder of What3Words. His company has helped Mongolia overhaul its postal and address system. It's based on the idea that every spot on Earth has its own unique coordinates. But long strings of numbers like GPS coordinates aren't exactly user-friendly, and this is where Chris Sheldrick's company comes in. I asked him how this new system works. SHELDRICK: What we've done is we've cut the world into 3-meter squares. So that's 57 trillion 3-meter squares. And there's enough words in the dictionary - so I'm talking words like table, chair, spoon - that you can actually assign three words to every 3-meter square in the world and you don't run out of combinations. So if I say toffee. branch. pyramid, then that's the name of a 3-meter square somewhere in the world. MARTIN: All right, so break that down into how this would serve Mongolians in practice. If someone before said, hey, you can find our house - we're next to the blue yurt on the right. Instead of that descriptor, they would - what? SHELDRICK: So the first thing that somebody would do would be to discover their three words. And the way they do that is they get the What3Words app, which is free, and they - the first thing that app will do is say, all right, here are the three words for where you are right now. So you might find you live at apple. spoon. pyramid. And then once you've got those three words, the post service or the courier can sort that mail, they can put it in the driver's routing package, and then the driver will route exactly to your front door. MARTIN: And it means, though, everybody in Mongolia who wants to use this system has to have some kind of access to the Internet. SHELDRICK: Most people in Mongolia have a smartphone. So yes, you need to be connected while you get the app, but it's important to understand the app works off-line. So once you've got it, you can go anywhere - in the middle of the desert - and you can press a button and it will tell you what your three words are there. MARTIN: How did the project come about? Did the Mongolian government approach you, or did you approach them? SHELDRICK: So I met one of the shareholders of the Mongolian post service at the World Economic Forum, and he told me about the need to have an addressing system in Mongolia. They were really crying out for it. So that's when I flew over there and then met the post service. I met the prime minister, I met the mayor of Ulaanbaatar, and everybody was incredibly supportive of the project that we're doing. MARTIN: I'm talking to you in Helsinki? Where are you right now, Chris? You can anticipate my next question. SHELDRICK: I can, but I'm on the phone. MARTIN: So you can't look up your address. SHELDRICK: (Laughter).

It's a huge strategic and symbolic loss for the Islamic State. Fallujah is one of several key cities Iraq has taken back. But ousting ISIS is only one of the battles Iraq must fight as a country. Political feuds, ethnic tensions and sectarian hatred have fragmented Iraq. Earlier this past week, I sat down with Lukman Faily, the Iraqi ambassador to the United States. In July, he's going to be leaving his post here in Washington. And we started our conversation by talking about the deep political divisions in his country. I asked him what he thought about recent suggestions by Kurdish leaders that Iraq just be split into three separate nations - Sunni, Shia and Kurdish. It was an idea, he said, works in theory but not so much in practice. LUKMAN FAILY: There always has to be an interdependency and a need for a mutual beneficial relationship between all the elements of the current existence of Iraq. So you cannot go and say, well, everybody have their own country. Even if we do that, we still need to talk each other. We still have an issue of ISIS as a threat to the region as a whole. The issues of separations and others can be discussed. However, the constitution, which the Kurds have ratified and agreed to, talk about unity of the country. MARTIN: So why do you think Iraq, with all its disparate elements, with years and years of sectarian conflict - what's the case that all these parties are safer together than they are apart? FAILY: The wealth of the country, the geopolitics within the region - if all of these three entities aspire for democracy in a region which is not democratic, then you want them to work with each other. On the other side of it, let's say you go with a division. What would this contain within the three borders? If you're promoting a new narrative based on nationality, ethnicity and others, why would the current borders of Iraq be contained within that? MARTIN: You're saying it's a slippery slope. Where do you draw the borders? FAILY: I'm saying where would - if the borders are artificial. . . MARTIN: Yeah, where would it end? FAILY: . . . Such as those (unintelligible) who are promoting it, there may have been - but (unintelligible). . . MARTIN: I mean, many people say that. . . FAILY: But that's a century now. Surely, we have learned for over a century how to work with each other. So Iraq is already a diverse, complicated situation because of civilizations, history and everything else. We have had generations of dictatorship engineering - socially destroying the fabric of the society - engineered that way. Saddam Hussein did it in culture of wars and everything else. So this requires generational fix. So it's not an issue of separation. Separation is a magic simple solution to a complicated problem. MARTIN: How do you see America's role in that? FAILY: It need to have that long view. The U. S. , if its policy based on the next presidency politics or view alone, then, unfortunately, it will not be a cohesive policy. It will not be a long effective policy because these issues requires cultural change, requires social change. So it has to be done by us. But we need the Americans and other countries to help us in governance, to certainly help us in getting rid of the tumors of ISIS, to give our politics a breathing space so that we can talk to each other in a more civil or in a more peaceful environment. MARTIN: The United States, as you know, has spent over $2 trillion in Iraq since the invasion in 2003. That's a lot of money. There's a lot of fatigue among the American population about the investment. FAILY: Let's - this way. MARTIN: How do you keep making the case? FAILY: The tragedy's not that. The tragedy is 5,000 soldiers. Tragedy is maybe 50,000-plus injured, maimed and others. The money can be generated. But lives going and so on - that's what I think we need to focus on. The region is. . . MARTIN: Is it complicated to ask the U. S. government to keep writing the checks but to let Iraq make the decisions? FAILY: No, no, no, no. Iraqis have wealthy country. We never said to the Americans we need (unintelligible) on the ground now. On the contrary, we're saying we don't. Even we get pushed, we say no. This is our fight. But we need the U. S. to enable us with technology, with better intelligence-sharing, with, for example, our pilots being trained better, faster. We need to go on a faster track in addressing our issues so that we can help you in addressing the global problem of terrorism. MARTIN: You and I have been talking about the long view and the necessity of taking the long view. In that spirit, may I ask you to look back in time and tell me, for the average, everyday Iraqi, is life better today than it was under Saddam Hussein? FAILY: Well, under Saddam Hussein we had what we might call republic of fear. People were not allowed to think. People were - had - certainly had not ability to change, to do anything about their lives. Now we have democracy - nascent democracy, I might add. Society is trying to be empowered. GDP per capita is 10 times better than during Saddam time. So I don't think it's that aspect of it. We certainly have high expectations and aspiration as a society. We may not know what it takes to go there. We may want to jumpstart it. We may want to do shortcuts. For example, we tried to fix issues with legislation while, in reality, we need to change the culture, not just legislations. So we need to have a long view of that aspect of it. So the Americans need to understand that. They need to understand the complexity of it. Unfortunately, people thought that only give them democracy, everything else will be on an autopilot. That's not working. That will never work. Why? Because the culture was not - the region is not accepting it. Let me give example, Arab Spring - tons of generations tried to change it. It was hijacked. Why? Because the politics were not there. It wasn't just an aspiration. You need the infrastructure of societies, NGOs and others to promote it and to guide it and to shepherd change in politics. That's not an easy aspect of it. MARTIN: Thank you so much for talking with us, Mr. Ambassador. We really appreciate your time. FAILY: Thank you for having me again. Wish you all the best.

S. Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station. Onboard were two people who needed medical attention according to the National Science Foundation which runs the station. It is winter in Antarctica right now, dark all the time and really cold. To hear how hard a rescue like this is, we called Jerry Macala. He was managing the station back in 2001 when the only doctor there got a gallstone. It was bad, so Macala called his bosses in the U. S. and requested something that had never happened before. Can we evacuate this man in the middle of winter? JERRY MACALA: And I just said, you know, no one's ever explained to me why we can't fly a plane down here in the winter. And I don't ever want to look back on this year and think that there was something else we could have done to save him. MCEVERS: And so how difficult was it, though, for the plane to get in and evacuate him? MACALA: From the ground support side, it was unprecedented. There was no rulebook, and there were no instructions. It was extremely cold. It was - it's mind-boggling how cold it gets down there. It was minus-92 when that plane landed in 2001. MCEVERS: And then once the plane did land, wasn't there some trouble getting it back up again? MACALA: It's mind-boggling how cold it gets down there. It was minus 92 when that plane landed in 2001. MCEVERS: And then once the plane did land, wasn't there some trouble getting it back up again? MACALA: Right. You know, it's a small plane. They can't bring two pilots and, you know, double-up on the crew. They have a very minimal crew. And that crew has to rest when they land the plane, so it had a 10-hour rest time. And during that time, the plane sat on the ski-way, and unfortunately the skis had frozen down to the ski-way. And, well, we had a heck of a time breaking the plane loose. MCEVERS: How did you do it? MACALA: You know, it was just a combination of brute force, basically. Everybody pitched in, and we rocked the wings and hit the skis with a big piece of the wood. And eventually it broke loose. MCEVERS: So what happened to the doctor who got evacuated? Is he all right? MACALA: Yeah. He was not happy to put people at risk, but it was a historic operation for sure. MCEVERS: Wow. So when you heard about this current evacuation, what did you think? You know, what's the first thing that came to your mind? MACALA: Well, I'll tell you I'm very concerned about, you know, everybody involved in the evacuation. It's a risky mission. You know, I would obviously try and minimize the risks on all fronts. But it's pretty scary, you know, to be out there in minus-75 or 95-degree weather with the blowing winds. And the amount of effort that it takes to prepare the station for that kind of a rescue is phenomenal. It really took a lot out of my crew and myself. In fact, I was out on the ski-way myself working on setting up the fueling and for the Twin Otter. And I spent a little bit too much time, you know, in the minus-90-degree weather and managed to do some frostbite on my feet. I wasn't sure if they were going to have to medivac me out of there with the doctor. MCEVERS: Wow. So you're just thinking, like, not only is this particular mission hard, but it's going to be, you know, tough on them going forward. MACALA: Well, it is, yes. You know, it's already pretty psychologically tough to be down there. In some ways, you feel like you're almost in sort of a cocoon because in many ways it's a very safe place to be isolated. But you have your community, and you have your, you know, your friends. And there's reasonably good food down there, and you know, it's warm when you want it to be warm. So. . . MCEVERS: Right, when you're not jumping on a plane. MACALA: Yeah, yeah. MCEVERS: And then when something like this happens it kind of breaks that spell. MACALA: Absolutely, yeah. MCEVERS: Yeah. Well, Jerry Macala, thank you so much. MACALA: Thank you. MCEVERS: Jerry Macala was the station manager in Antarctica from 2000 to 2001. He now lives in Santa Barbara.

NPR's Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson is in Berlin with the latest details for us. Soraya, what do we know at this point? SORAYA SARHADDI NELSON, BYLINE: Well, the shooter is dead. That much seems to be clear. A SWAT team was sent in. This was in a small town near Mannheim, the city of Mannheim, in south central Germany - I guess is the best way to describe it. And apparently, the SWAT team went in and they were able to kill the masked man. There's no clear identification who this person was or what ethnicity he was or what his motive was. But obviously there are a lot of jitters here that perhaps this was related to some sort of terrorism or terror attempt. There were - as far as we know, none of the people who were in the theater with this gunman were injured. GREENE: Well, I mean that would be very good news because there were some earlier reports suggesting otherwise, but as far as we know at this point I mean, no one, injured no one killed, which would be very - a big relief. NELSON: Well, apparently the police were treating some people on the outside, at least according to a spokesman who was interviewed by local television here. He did say that there might've - I mean there was some indication there were perhaps some people injured by tear gas and other measures that were taken by police in order to subdue this gunman. GREENE: How much unease is there right now in Germany? I mean I think about the terror attacks that I know - I mean you have been involved in covering, I've been involved in covering, in Paris, in Brussels, I mean what happened recently in the United States, in Orlando. I mean, how nervous are people in that country? NELSON: Well, I have never known Germans to be quite a jittery as I've seen them, at least in modern history, shall we say (laughter). Certainly, they're very nervous about what's been happening in Brussels and Paris. There was an - there were arrests earlier this month of three people in Germany, one person in France, who were apparently planning an attack in Dusseldorf, you know, a very popular city down in the downtown. That's where they were planning to let loose with guns and the like, although none of those weapons were found. So people here are very nervous, although it certainly hasn't stopped Germans from going out to public viewing places to watch the soccer championship that's going on right now. But there's no doubt that people here get very jittery, and even though the motives of this gunman in the theater are not known yet - and it's - you might be surprised that on a day like the middle of the week here that you would have people in the theater, but it is very hot here today and air conditioning is not very common. And so I'm sure many people, if they could get away, went to the theater. GREENE: Middle of the afternoon. If you can find a cool place, I mean, why not go see a movie? NELSON: Exactly. So - but people are very nervous, and there's no doubt that this will foster even more reaction against the asylum-seekers, who of course came here in very large numbers last year, more than 1. 1 million. And there's a lot of concern about all these people coming in that terrorists might be slipping in with them. GREENE: What are gun laws like in Germany? I mean, that's a question that always comes up when there's an incident involving a gun the United States. NELSON: Well, certainly it's a country that has a lot more gun ownership than you think, even though the gun laws are very strict here. I've seen numbers as high as this being the fourth - nation with the fourth highest number of guns that are owned. But they in fact have very strict laws. There's a very strict registry here which the interior ministries in the various states would like to see made even tougher so that guns can be tracked through the life of ownerships. So not just registering who owns it, but who owned it before and who owned it before that and when it was created. And so that's something that's being debated now, and I'm sure will be debated even more after what happened today. GREENE: OK. That's NPR's Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson in Berlin. Soraya, thanks a lot.

And so I'm sure many people, if they could get away, went to the theater. GREENE: Middle of the afternoon. If you can find a cool place, I mean, why not go see a movie? NELSON: Exactly. So - but people are very nervous, and there's no doubt that this will foster even more reaction against the asylum-seekers, who of course came here in very large numbers last year, more than 1. 1 million. And there's a lot of concern about all these people coming in that terrorists might be slipping in with them. GREENE: What are gun laws like in Germany? I mean, that's a question that always comes up when there's an incident involving a gun the United States. NELSON: Well, certainly it's a country that has a lot more gun ownership than you think, even though the gun laws are very strict here. I've seen numbers as high as this being the fourth - nation with the fourth highest number of guns that are owned. But they in fact have very strict laws. There's a very strict registry here which the interior ministries in the various states would like to see made even tougher so that guns can be tracked through the life of ownerships. So not just registering who owns it, but who owned it before and who owned it before that and when it was created. And so that's something that's being debated now, and I'm sure will be debated even more after what happened today. GREENE: OK. That's NPR's Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson in Berlin. Soraya, thanks a lot.

He's seeking to offer encouragement to the tiny nation squeezed between Turkey and Russia. He's already weighed in on the sensitive subject of the Ottoman Empire's massacres and the displacement of Armenians a century ago. NPR's Sylvia Poggioli is traveling with the pope. SYLVIA POGGIOLI, BYLINE: The three-day papal visit to Armenia is highlighting the strong ecumenical ties between the majority Orthodox and smaller Catholic Christian communities. The pope has also come to promote reconciliation in a tense region that straddles Europe, Russia and the Middle East. Massimo Faggioli, a professor of Catholic Church history, says that in visiting Armenia, Pope Francis is also sending a specific message to a geopolitcally-strategic region. MASSIMO FAGGIOLI: Religion should not be part of a global, colonial enterprise. POGGIOLI: Reached by Skype, Faggioli says the pope is very critical of the way both Russia and Turkey mix nationalism with their respective religions, the Orthodox Church and Islam. FAGGIOLI: So Armenia is in the middle geographically and historically between Turkey and Russia. So going there Pope Francis is more or less poking a finger into the eye of the most important nationalist actors in the area. POGGIOLI: Today he praised the Armenian people for their courageous testimony to their faith and who have suffered greatly, but who yet have shown themselves capable of constantly being reborn. During his visit, Francis will also meet Syrian refugees and is expected to speak out again on the modern-day slaughter of Christians and other minorities by Islamist extremists. The pope is also likely to reignite tensions with Turkey when he visits the memorial of the victims of the Ottoman-era slaughter of Armenians. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)POGGIOLI: Commemorating the centenary of the mass killings last year in St. Peter's Basilica, Pope Francis used the G word. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)POPE FRANCIS: (Through interpreter) The first genocide of the 21st century was against you, the Armenian people. POGGIOLI: Turkey was furious and recalled its ambassador to the Holy See for a full 10 months. Historians widely agree that some 1 and a half million Armenians were killed. But Turkey vehemently rejects the genocide label, claiming the number of dead was smaller and were victims of civil strife. In a possible signal of diplomatic compromise with Turkey, the prepared text of the pope's speech at the presidential palace used the Armenian term for the mass killings, Medz Yeghern, which means the great evil. But in his delivery, Francis added the politically-charged word genocide. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)POPE FRANCIS: (Through interpreter) That tragedy, that genocide was the first of the deplorable series of catastrophes of the past century, made possible by twisted racial ideological or religious aims that darken the minds of the tormentors, even to the point of planning the annihilation of entire peoples. POGGIOLI: Before he returns to Rome Sunday, Francis will visit a monastery in the foothills of Mount Ararat, which according to the Bible is where Noah's Ark came to rest. There near the closed border with Turkey, he'll release a flock of doves as a sign of peace and reconciliation in the region. Sylvia Poggioli, NPR News, Yerevan.

The fighting displaced tens of thousands of people from the city, and they have been living under very difficult conditions in the desert with little food, shelter or water. I talked to Loveday Morris about this. She's the Baghdad bureau chief for The Washington Post. And she just got back from Fallujah. I asked her to describe what she saw in the city after security forces moved in. LOVEDAY MORRIS: There was quite a celebratory feel really, actually. There was a lot of people firing their guns in the air and playing music, driving through the city - still a lot of IEDs around, a lot of roadside bombs. So that's the real work now will be clearing those. There were some explosions going off as people accidently triggered those in the city yesterday. So that's going to be a real task going forward. MCEVERS: Fallujah is a city where U. S. forces, of course, fought long and hard battles in. And many people expected this battle to take a lot longer than it did. I mean, we're talking about, you know, five weeks. How were Iraqi forces able to do it so quickly? And I guess, what does that say about the state of ISIS in Iraq right now? MORRIS: ISIS is certainly on the back foot in Iraq right now. They've lost more than 40 percent of their territory. Some people thought this would be a really tough fight for the Iraqi security forces. It was a tough fight, but they did do it a lot faster than people expected. Talking to commanders on the ground, they put that down to a few reasons. One is that Fallujah's been wringed for months, if not almost a year, by security forces. Their supply lines have been slowly cut off. Also, the sentiment of the local population - I think when the Americans were coming into Fallujah there was a lot more anti-American sentiment, whereas a lot of Fallujains (ph), speaking to them over time, were really fed up with ISIS. So I think that's definitely a factor. MCEVERS: We've seen the reports that, you know, more than 80,000 people fled Fallujah. I mean, it is a very hot time in Iraq right now. I mean, a couple days ago you tweeted, in 4 1/2 years of covering Syria and Iraq, I've never seen conditions this bad. No tents, no water, no words. Are people still living like this? MORRIS: I haven't been back up since that day when people were first flooding out, and conditions were really horrific. A lot of people, despite those really harsh temperatures, maybe more of the people that had tents, were saying they were glad to be out of Fallujah. There were others that were saying, you know, this is much worse. We wish we never left. There was one family I was talking to that really stuck out. It was a woman and her children. They'd been sleeping out for three or four days in the desert. They had a disabled son, and he wasn't able to get medication and had chronic pain. His legs were cramping, and he was actually just - the whole time I was speaking to the family he was just screaming in pain. And they had absolutely nothing. They were sitting there with no tent, one blanket between them. And it was really, really harrowing to speak to them. MCEVERS: It sounds like attention now, of course, will turn to getting people back home. And also now the next battle, which is for the northern Iraqi city of Mosul. I guess the question is, you know, with ISIS on its heels, as you said, and losing territory in Iraq, are they going to be doubling down in Mosul? I mean, will that make it a much harder fight? MORRIS: Perhaps, I mean, I suppose one of two things could happen. You either see them doubling down and really, ferociously fighting for that city. Or you might see them almost cutting their losses to a certain extent and turning back to those more insurgent tactics. But no one expects Mosul to be an easy fight, for sure. You know, it's a much bigger city than Fallujah. MCEVERS: Right. MORRIS: There are a lot more civilians. It's second, third-biggest city in Iraq, really. So it's going to be a huge challenge.

What happens when a banker to the world starts cutting itself off from the world? LINDA WERTHEIMER, HOST: London is a great financial center. And it is, of course, in Great Britain whose people just voted to leave the European Union. NPR's Jim Zarroli reports on what happens to the banks now. JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: London has been a global money center for centuries. But in recent decades, with deregulation and the explosion of global trade, its importance has only grown, especially in derivatives and asset management. It now rivals New York City as a financial power. Nicola Veron is a senior fellow at the Belgian think tank Bruegel. NICOLAS VERON: There has been a rise in financial globalization, more financial business being done across borders. And London has positioned itself as the best place to capture this business. ZARROLI: London doesn't just have big banks and trading firms. It has a huge army of accountants and lawyers and consultants. In fact, the financial services industry plays a much bigger part in the U. K. 's economy than it does in the United States'. Before the Brexit vote, Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne warned a group of bank employees about the consequences of leaving the EU.

K. is part of the European Union, its companies can do business anywhere on the continent. And it can move people around without worrying about visas. But last week's Brexit vote leaves everything up in the air. Mark Compton is a partner at the law firm Mayer Brown in London. And he says no one really knows how the vote will affect financial firms. MARK COMPTON: Although the people have voted to leave, nobody will know for a number of years exactly the terms on which we will be leaving. ZARROLI: And he says no one really knows how the vote will affect financial firms. COMPTON: So the U. K. is going to be wanting to do its best to preserve the trading environment for financial services, not only for its own businesses, but for those from the U. S. , Asia and elsewhere that have set themselves up in London. So it's going to be fighting to keep that. ZARROLI: Compton says the U. K. could leave the EU but join another union called the European Economic Area. It's not a great option. Joining it would allow the U. K. to still do business anywhere on the continent. But it wouldn't have any say in the EU's laws. And it would still have to open its borders to unfettered immigration, which, given last week's vote, seems politically unpalatable. In the meantime, some big banks are already drawing up plans to pull employees out of London. Nicolas Veron says banks are anxious to show customers they have a plan B.

At least 36 people have been killed and more than a hundred wounded. Jared Malsin is a Middle East correspondent for TIME. We reached him via Skype at Ataturk Airport where he spoke with witnesses to the attack. JARED MALSIN: Yes, I spoke with several witnesses who were inside the airport during the explosions. They all confirmed at least two explosions, possibly three, although that's the last one we are not sure about. One witness, an American passenger who was landing when the explosions happened, showed me photos of what looked like broken glass at the passport control. So it looks like there was either gunfire or or some other kind of violence that took place deep inside the airport. Otherwise it's been a very chaotic. . . SIEGEL: Yeah. MALSIN: . . . Night here with hundreds of passengers and airline employees stranded inside the airport for two or three hours. And then the police have been letting them out in stages, so it's been hundreds of people kind of coming out of the terminal with their luggage, all the while ambulances' sirens blaring coming to and fro, obviously heavily armed police deployed in force here. . . SIEGEL: Yeah. MALSIN: . . . And yeah, a number of very distraught people. SIEGEL: Jared, you said that you've heard about at least two explosions. Were they in rapid succession? Were they in the same terminal, the same close space? What have you heard. SIEGEL: So it's - again, it's very early still, but what I was told by people who were inside the airport at the time - said first there was one explosion that kind of stunned people and then a second one very soon after that that triggered a kind of panic or maybe almost a stampede inside the airport. And I can't exactly recreate right now where those explosions were, but it appears that they were inside the airport somewhere. For now, the police are not allowing most press to enter the grounds of the airport. There's a cordon set up, so we've been set back several hundred yards here from the scene of the blasts. But I'm sure more details are going to emerge soon. SIEGEL: Yes. And as you understand it, at this point, it's been a few hours. Is the assumption. . . MALSIN: Yep. SIEGEL: . . . That the attackers have either been killed or took their own lives, or is it still regarded as a live situation at all? MALSIN: No, the assumption is that the attack, as it were, is over and any of the assailants are obviously subdued at this point. There were a number of reports that they were killed by security forces. But again, in any kind of attack like this, there's - it's a very fluid situation, so we don't know exactly. But in any case, no, it's - things have significantly calmed down. Now there's no sign of any ongoing fighting or violence right now. SIEGEL: And is there any indication that Turkish authorities might make a statement or brief reporters publicly at - sometime soon? MALSIN: Yeah, the Turkish authorities have been releasing statements to the national media as well as various wire agencies. Here at the airport itself, they're not saying much, so I can't help you that much in that particular area. But I expect we'll hear more from them soon. SIEGEL: Well, thanks for filling us in on what you've heard and what's going on right now at Ataturk International Airport. MALSIN: Sure. SIEGEL: That's Jared Malsin of TIME. ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:  We're following the attack on Istanbul's Ataturk International Airport. At least 36 people have been killed and more than a hundred wounded. Jared Malsin is a Middle East correspondent for TIME. We reached him via Skype at Ataturk Airport where he spoke with witnesses to the attack. JARED MALSIN: Yes, I spoke with several witnesses who were inside the airport during the explosions. They all confirmed at least two explosions, possibly three, although that's the last one we are not sure about. One witness, an American passenger who was landing when the explosions happened, showed me photos of what looked like broken glass at the passport control. So it looks like there was either gunfire or or some other kind of violence that took place deep inside the airport. Otherwise it's been a very chaotic. . . SIEGEL: Yeah. MALSIN: . . . Night here with hundreds of passengers and airline employees stranded inside the airport for two or three hours. And then the police have been letting them out in stages, so it's been hundreds of people kind of coming out of the terminal with their luggage, all the while ambulances' sirens blaring coming to and fro, obviously heavily armed police deployed in force here. . . SIEGEL: Yeah. MALSIN: . . . And yeah, a number of very distraught people. SIEGEL: Jared, you said that you've heard about at least two explosions. Were they in rapid succession? Were they in the same terminal, the same close space? What have you heard. SIEGEL: So it's - again, it's very early still, but what I was told by people who were inside the airport at the time - said first there was one explosion that kind of stunned people and then a second one very soon after that that triggered a kind of panic or maybe almost a stampede inside the airport. And I can't exactly recreate right now where those explosions were, but it appears that they were inside the airport somewhere. For now, the police are not allowing most press to enter the grounds of the airport. There's a cordon set up, so we've been set back several hundred yards here from the scene of the blasts. But I'm sure more details are going to emerge soon. SIEGEL: Yes. And as you understand it, at this point, it's been a few hours. Is the assumption. . . MALSIN: Yep. SIEGEL: . . .

At least 36 people are dead, and more than a hundred are injured. Reporter Dalia Mortada joins us with an update from Istanbul. And Dalia, what are authorities there saying about what happened? DALIA MORTADA, BYLINE: Well, Turkey's prime minister said in a press conference that three attackers allegedly opened fire at the airport and then detonated their suicide vests. He said that 36 people have been killed so far, and more than a hundred people have been injured. The number of casualties is expect to rise, and foreign nationals are likely among them. SIEGEL: Do we know how this attack was carried out? MORTADA: The prime minister said so far, based on the initial findings, the attackers got to the airport by a yellow cab. And when they got the airport, he said that they began shooting, and then they detonated their vests. They attacked during a very busy time for international travel, and Istanbul Ataturk Airport, is the country's largest international airport. And authorities are looking into up to three suicide bombers in the attack. SIEGEL: Now, this attack is really part of a wave of attacks that Turkey has experienced. Does it fit into a pattern? MORTADA: It does. I mean, this is the fourth attack in Istanbul in 2016, and in the last year, major cities in Turkey have seen more than half a dozen attacks. A lot of these attacks have either been blamed on ISIS or ISIS affiliates or claimed by Kurdish militants. This attack in particular actually - the prime minister said that initial findings are pointed to the Islamic State. But that's as far as - that's as much as we know.

MARY LOUISE KELLY, BYLINE: It is a fluid situation unfolding at Ataturk Airport.

The governor of Istanbul says they are looking into possibly three, but again, we don't know. We don't know where exactly in the airport this - these explosions may have taken place, whether they were before or after security checkpoints or a combination - and how many attackers also still an unknown.

DALIA MORTADA, BYLINE: Well, what we know so far is that at least one explosion and possibly two happened at Istanbul Ataturk Airport. That's Istanbul's largest where thousands of travelers go through every day. And we've got confirmation from the Justice Ministry that at least 10 people were killed, and state news is reporting about 60 are wounded, six seriously wounded. There are reports that the airport has been closed, although that's not been confirmed. And that's pretty much what we know so far. SIEGEL: Has any group claimed responsibility for this attack? MORTADA: No, there hasn't been a claim of responsibility yet. This attack happened maybe about two hours ago - so very recently. And there hasn't been a claim of responsibility so far. SIEGEL: Now, this is a particularly deadly attack, that is, already the government says. Ten people have been killed and, as you say, six seriously wounded among 60 wounded generally. There have been other attacks recently in Istanbul. What has happened? MORTADA: That's right. This is the fourth attack in Istanbul in 2016, and that doesn't include attacks in Ankara, Turkey's capital. Just three weeks ago, there was a bombing - a car bombing that killed 11 people and Istanbul. There was another attack in March that killed five people in Central Istanbul and another one in January that killed almost a dozen people. And the thing that very few people know or very few people realize is that this is not something that happens very often in Istanbul. This year has been very, very violent for this city. SIEGEL: And the groups that were implicated in those attacks. . . MORTADA: Right. So in those attacks, Kurdish militants and Islamic State-affiliated militants have been blamed or have claimed responsibility for those attacks. So there's a good chance that this could be from one of those groups, but we don't have that kind of information yet. SIEGEL: Once again, the story - an attack at Istanbul airport - according to Turkish officials, 10 dead, as you say, 60 injured, 6 of them very seriously. What's actually happening now at the airport? MORTADA: Right now at the airport, there are reports that planes are landing, but passengers are being kept on the other side of the terminal where they're landing. There are reports of helicopters hovering over the airport and reports of the injured being transported in taxis if the ambulances can't get to them. It's pretty much on lockdown until they can figure out what's going on. SIEGEL: OK. Journalist Dalia Mortada in Istanbul, thanks for talking with us. MORTADA: Thank you, Robert.

ISIS has not claimed responsibility. CIA Director John Brennan told an audience in Washington that the group may never do so. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JOHN BRENNAN: Well, to my knowledge there is no credible claim of responsibility at this point. But that's not very surprising because at least in most instances, if not all, ISIS has not claimed credit or responsibility for attacks that are perpetrated inside of Turkey. SIEGEL: NPR's counterterrorism correspondent Dina Temple-Raston is following the investigation, and she joins us now. And, Dina, before we get to the details of the investigation, I want you to explain what the CIA director just said. Why doesn't ISIS claim responsibility for attacks inside Turkey? DINA TEMPLE-RASTON, BYLINE: Well, CIA Director Brennan was talking to the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington, and he said that ISIS carries out these attacks to send a signal to Turkish officials to put them on notice, if you will. But the group doesn't claim responsibility outright because it doesn't want to alienate Turks who might be sympathetic to their cause. There was a suicide bombing on a shopping district in Istanbul at the end of March. And four people were killed, and 36 were wounded. And ISIS never took formal responsibility. In the past six months, there have been four deadly attacks in Turkey, and most of them were connected to a Kurdish separatist group called the PKK. In this case, the Turkish government has been very, very quick to say that they suspect this is ISIS, and Brennan seemed to confirm their suspicions. SIEGEL: Well, what have they - what have Turkish investigators discovered so far that leads them to believe that it's ISIS? TEMPLE-RASTON: Well, right now the evidence is circumstantial. The PKK as a general matter has limited itself to military and police targets inside Turkey. Civilian targets like this fit much more into ISIS's attack profile. The way the attack unfolded in Istanbul is very reminiscent of both the November 13 attacks in Paris and the airport attack in Brussels this past May. ISIS took responsibility for both those attacks. In the November 13 attacks, there were a number of gunmen who, as you remember, fanned out across Paris and just opened fire on people in cafes and at a concert hall. And then the gunmen ignited these explosive vests. That appears to be exactly what happened in Istanbul. And then during the Brussels Airport attack, gunmen stored the - stormed the departure hall just like they did last night in Istanbul. So that's why U. S. officials are saying this attack has as - in their words - all the hallmarks of ISIS. SIEGEL: Apart from those hallmarks of ISIS, what are your sources telling you about this investigation? TEMPLE-RASTON: We spoke to U. S. officials who'd been briefed and what we understand they know so far is that there are at least three foreign nationals who were involved. Investigators in Turkey interviewed and released the taxi driver who had actually dropped the attackers off at the airport at 10 p. m. local time last night. And we understand that he was very helpful to the investigation. And, again, if you look at the Brussels attacks back in May, the taxi driver who dropped off the attackers was a goldmine of information for police. He took them back to the building where he picked up the attackers, and inside the police found the apartment where the bombs were constructed. They found fingerprints that belonged to accomplices, so that was really a key to that investigation. And Turkish officials are hoping for something similar this time around. SIEGEL: That's NPR's counterterrorism correspondent Dina Temple-Raston. Dina, thanks. TEMPLE-RASTON: You're welcome.

The way the attack unfolded in Istanbul is very reminiscent of both the November 13 attacks in Paris and the airport attack in Brussels this past May. ISIS took responsibility for both those attacks. In the November 13 attacks, there were a number of gunmen who, as you remember, fanned out across Paris and just opened fire on people in cafes and at a concert hall. And then the gunmen ignited these explosive vests. That appears to be exactly what happened in Istanbul. And then during the Brussels Airport attack, gunmen stored the - stormed the departure hall just like they did last night in Istanbul. So that's why U. S. officials are saying this attack has as - in their words - all the hallmarks of ISIS. SIEGEL: Apart from those hallmarks of ISIS, what are your sources telling you about this investigation? TEMPLE-RASTON: We spoke to U. S. officials who'd been briefed and what we understand they know so far is that there are at least three foreign nationals who were involved. Investigators in Turkey interviewed and released the taxi driver who had actually dropped the attackers off at the airport at 10 p. m. local time last night. And we understand that he was very helpful to the investigation. And, again, if you look at the Brussels attacks back in May, the taxi driver who dropped off the attackers was a goldmine of information for police. He took them back to the building where he picked up the attackers, and inside the police found the apartment where the bombs were constructed. They found fingerprints that belonged to accomplices, so that was really a key to that investigation. And Turkish officials are hoping for something similar this time around.

It was the last time that he'll take part in one of these so-called three amigos summits. The North American leaders tried to present a united front, especially in contrast to what's happening in Europe after Brexit. NPR's Scott Horsley has been monitoring the summit, and he joins us now. And Scott, on his way to Ottawa this morning, President Obama telephoned Turkey's president to express sympathy for yesterday's airport attack. What did he say? SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Robert, President Obama called President Erdogan from Air Force One, and he offered condolences. He also offered help with the investigation into who's behind that deadly suicide bombing. Turkey has blamed the attack on ISIS. Obama did not go quite that far. He says we're still learning the facts, but he did say this is part of a broader, shared fight against terrorist networks. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BARACK OBAMA: I'm confident that we can and we will defeat those who offer only death and destruction, and we will always remember, even as there are those who are trying to divide us, that we are stronger when we come together and work toward a better world together. SIEGEL: Working together seemed to be a big theme of the North American leaders today. HORSLEY: That's right. President Obama and his counterparts from Mexico and Canada seem determined to showcase what an integrated continent looks like. They took some steps to ease travel among the three countries and to further harmonized trade. The centerpiece of this summit was their ambitious new pledged to boost clean energy production. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says in less than a decade, these three countries hope to be getting half of their electricity from carbon-free sources that don't contribute to climate change. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JUSTIN TRUDEAU: This is what can happen when countries come together in pursuit of a common goal, when we have a big idea and the political will to make it happen. Today's climate agreement stands as proof that cooperation pays off and that working together always beats going it alone. SIEGEL: Hearing Trudeau speak of going it alone, it sounds like a reference to the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, Donald Trump, whose campaign has been antagonistic to both Mexico and Canada. How did that color today's summit? HORSLEY: Yeah, there were some veiled and not-so-veiled references to Donald Trump in a joint news conference that the three leaders held after their summit meeting. And there's no question that if Donald Trump were to be elected in November, it would mark a sharp reversal from this spirit of continental cooperation. Trump has talked about building a wall along the U. S. border with Mexico and about either renegotiating or withdrawing altogether from the North American Free Trade Agreement. Both the Canadian prime minister and the Mexican president said they would of course work with whomever American voters choose as the next president, but it's pretty clear they don't like the idea of Donald Trump in the White House. And Obama also chimed in at that news conference this afternoon, challenging the idea that Trump is running as a populist. He suggested the presumptive Republican nominee has never shown any regard for workers or fought for social justice. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)OBAMA: Somebody who labels us versus them or engages in rhetoric about how we're going to look after ourselves and take it to the other guy - that's not the definition of populism. HORSLEY: Obama suggested a few other -isms of his own, including nativism and cynicism. He also expanded on the ideas of international cooperation during a speech later this evening to the Canadian Parliament. SIEGEL: OK. That's NPR's Scott Horsley. Scott, thanks.

First here's NPR's Leila Fadel who spent time today at Ataturk Airport where the attack took place. (CROSSTALK)LEILA FADEL, BYLINE: People are rolling their bags through the arrivals hall. I overhear a conversation from a diplomat about French nationals. I see parts of the ceiling missing, and behind me there's radiating cracks in the glass windows. Just yesterday there was a huge tragedy right here, and today the airport is open and functioning. RACHA HAMZA: Oh, my God.

In the terminal, the blood has been wiped away. Workers are painting, repairing the ceiling and building scaffolds to fix the damage and get back to business as usual. The floors are newly bleached, but there's still the faint smell of stale flesh and blood. And Hamza was here trying to make this same trip home yesterday when the attack occurred. HAMZA: Everything was normal. It was time to go to our gate. We went to the gate. We sat. We ate. And we were just sitting there, and then we heard something like - everything was shaking. Like, the sound was very strong. At the same moment, we saw people running. FADEL: She describes mass panic. Today Turkey is trying to put together the details through video, pictures, witness accounts and official statements. Three men showed up at the airport in a taxi. They drew suspicion because they wore jackets in the middle of summer. It seems right now that security forces slowed their entry deep into the airport. The men opened fire. Two of them detonated their suicide vests inside the arrivals hall, and a third detonated in the parking lot just outside. The exact sequence of events is still unclear, and amid all this, Hamza and her sister were with a group of people that forced through a door onto the plane they were supposed to take.

But the ground staff had run away. These two women survived uninjured. So many others did not. Less than five miles away, distraught family members sit outside a hospital. EMINEH: (Foreign language spoken). FADEL: A Turkish woman named Emineh sits on a bench, waiting to hear news of her brother. He's in his second surgery already. He was picking up her daughter from the airport. She lives in Germany and was going to surprise her mom. When the first blast went off, he tried to help the wounded, but in the second bombing, he was hit with shrapnel. She's praying for him to live. EMINEH: (Through interpreter) I've been here since last night. I haven't had a wink of sleep. We are feeling great pain now. May God prevent bigger pain. FADEL: She only gives her first name because she's critical of the government and doesn't want to get in trouble. She says government officials sit in their seats of power while regular people like her family face atrocities like this. Like other Turks, she blames the government for not preventing these attacks. This is the fourth in Istanbul this year. She says a few extremists are turning the country into hell. (CROSSTALK)FADEL: He's in the intensive care (unintelligible).

S. -led coalition that's fighting ISIS. The president's special envoy on ISIS Brett McGurk says Turkey has already done a lot in that fight, namely serving as a base for air missions to Syria. But McGurk says the U. S. will press Turkey to do more after this attack in Istanbul. I asked him what that might look like, and he talked about an operation that's underway now. BRETT MCGURK: We call it the Manbij Gap. It's about a 98-kilometer strip of border that ISIL has controlled with Turkey for some years now. And we're working now to close it up. We launched a surprise attack against ISIL about three weeks ago across the Euphrates River. They've now enveloped the city of Manbij. That's important because Manbij is the city in which the Brussels attacks, the Paris attacks were kind of organized. As we are in the midst of that operation, we are collecting really a bonanza of information about their foreign fighter network, about their external operations planning arms. And that's something that will continue. And with Turkey, we're working with a number of opposition groups to push east to kind of close off this border area which ISIL continues to try to transit. It's a tough fight. We're actually making a lot of progress, but Turkey will be part and parcel of the success of that operation. MCEVERS: You told Congress yesterday that the threat of an ISIL or ISIS attack like the one in Istanbul here in the U. S. is real, and if that's true, what does that say about the strategy against ISIS up until now? MCGURK: Yeah. There's different types of attacks. There's the lone wolf attack that they inspire deranged individuals such as - I think we saw the terrible tragedy, the horrible crime most recently in Orlando. But then there's the very sophisticated attacks such as Brussels, such as Paris which are planned in Raqqah, which are organized in Syria and which are launched from there, their kind of phony caliphate. And it's pretty clear that what's driving so many people to join this movement is this notion of this caliphate that it's a historic movement, that it's expanding and that's why it's so important to show that, one, you're not going to have a safe haven to plan attacks abroad, and, secondly, you're not an expanding movement. You're actually shrinking and shrinking rapidly. But that said, the numbers of foreign fighters that they have been able to indoctrinate really over the last five years is something that we all have to remain vigilant about. We cannot let up our guard. We can't let up our guard this month, this year and for years to come. MCEVERS: You say we know that some of these more coordinated attacks were planned from places where ISIS holds territory. But could they not plan those from a basement somewhere else? I mean, this idea of taking territory doesn't necessarily seem to be working. MCGURK: Well, the network that did the Brussels and Paris attacks was a very sophisticated network of planners, of bomb-makers, of tacticians. That's the kind of thing that actually does take real organization and real skill. And those skills are, you know, in shorter supply than you might think. So what we're trying to do is identify the networks and really unravel them. That does not mean you'll be able to stop every lone wolf attack, but what we want to be able to do is make it much harder for them to plan a very sophisticated horrific attack such as we saw in Brussels, Paris and appears here in Istanbul. MCEVERS: President Obama has said it would take three years to defeat ISIS. We're about two years into that process. Yesterday, you told Congress you think this will be done sooner than the three-year mark. So game this out for me exactly. You know, what's next - the Iraqi city of Mosul, the Syrian city of Raqqa? Where are you going after ISIS next? MCGURK: Look, when we started this in the fall of 2014, there was very few forces on the ground that could stand up to ISIL. And since then, we've taken back about half their territory in Iraq, about 20 percent in Syria. But most importantly, it's not just the landmass. It's the strategic territory. Next on the list certainly is Mosul and then Raqqa. That is the brain and the heart of ISIL. And as I speak at this hour, there's a number of very important maneuvers going on south of Mosul to set the conditions for Mosul. MCEVERS: How long is it going to take? MCGURK: I'm just not going to put a timeframe on it. MCEVERS: Yeah, because, you know, we've talked to people at the Pentagon who say, you know, these are things that could take months. In those months, we have to think that more of these attacks will come. MCGURK: What we're doing before we move into Raqqa proper is isolating Raqqa entirely. We've cut off all the roadways between Raqqa and Mosul, and we're now in the process of cutting off all the access routes from the Turkey border into Raqqa. In the meantime, there are terrorists in Raqqa who are planning external attacks. We're trying to find them, and when we do find them, we target them. We're getting more information every single day on ISIL. We're learning who the leaders are. We're learning who they're connected to, and when we find out where they are, we target them. We're taking out about one leader now every three days. MCEVERS: That's Brett McGurk. He is the White House's point person on the fight against ISIL. Thanks so much for being with us.

This attack is the latest of more than a dozen in the past year alone. Some of those Turkey has blamed on a Kurdish separatist group it's been fighting for years. Other attacks, including this one, it has blamed on ISIS. Soner Cagaptay is the director of the Turkish Research Program at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, and he says this attack on the airport is different from all the ones that came before. I asked him why. SONER CAGAPTAY: This is the third-busiest airport in Europe, eleventh-busiest in the world and the airport which is the entry point for a majority of the more than 35 million people who visit Turkey. It's also an image of Turkey being a safe place to visit and to do business. So this will not only unfortunately kill Turkey's very lucrative tourism industry, but also it will hurt the country's economic standing, investment credibility. And I think as a result of that, Turkey will have to come down on ISIS with full vengeance. SIEGEL: Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan has fashioned himself as a strong man. He's turned the presidency of Turkey. . . CAGAPTAY: Correct. SIEGEL: . . . Into a very powerful office. He doesn't look so strong if his country's being attacked by terrorists. CAGAPTAY: That's also correct. Erdogan has thrived on an image of a right wing, strongman president. He does not let anybody get away with insulting him. We have seen him go after journalists. He's also obviously been a strong man in foreign policy. He's just got the Israelis to apologize as a condition for normalizing relations. He cannot let the Islamic State get away with this attack, so he has to come down very strongly. Two ways he can do that - one is with the U. S. He's going to now increase cooperation with the United States, but he also has to go into Syria where the root cause of the ISIL problem is. SIEGEL: But Turkey's main concern in Syria in the war next door has been ousting President Bashar al-Assad, not fighting against ISIS's or the Islamic State. This now changes. CAGAPTAY: Correct. It changes as of yesterday. Until yesterday, Turkey had one priority in Syria. It was ousting Assad. Turkey's entire Syria policy has been based on one premise. It is that Assad will go. Good guys will take over. And if a few bad guys have gone in in the meantime, that's OK. They will help accelerate Assad's demise. Well, guess what? Assad is not going. And I think Turkey hasn't acknowledged that reality until today. So now it faces, first, the prospect that Assad is staying and, second, that those bad guys that went into Syria, some of whom have morphed unwillingly in front of Turkey's eyes into what's called ISIS, are now a threat to Turkey. And Turkey has to go after that threat now more than it goes after Assad. SIEGEL: In this odd three-cornered conflict that Turkey is involved in in which it's against ISIS - it's also against the Syria Kurds, and the Syria Kurds are in fact fighting against ISIS - I mean, it would seem to me that the Turks would regard ISIS at a great bother that can stage terrorist acts and murder people but doesn't threaten the integrity or the existence of the Turkish republic. Will they ever regard ISIS as a bigger threat than a Kurdish movement? CAGAPTAY: The perception that Turkish leaders did not see ISIS as an existential threat was probably correct until yesterday's attack. That has changed with the attack. Until yesterday, ISIS was engaging in what I call limited warfare against Turkey. Yes, it carried out suicide bomb attacks in Turkey, but they were nowhere near in terms of destruction, scope and impact compared to what you saw at the Istanbul Airport attack. And I think ISIS has gone now from having being engaged in limited warfare against Turkey to being engaged in full-scale warfare, and Turkey will react with full war as well. I would expect Turkey's vengeance to come down on ISIS like rain from hell. SIEGEL: I'm trying to imagine myself as a U. S. policymaker right now. Would I be pleased to see that Turkey is now saying, OK, we're going to give up the project of ousting Bashar al-Assad as president; instead, we'll mobilize, send forces into Syria and take on ISIS? CAGAPTAY: I think that this is a closer alignment of Turkish-U. S. positions. For a long time now, the U. S. has prioritized defeating ISIS or ousting Assad regime. Turkey's priorities have been the opposite until yesterday, and I think the ISIL attack in Turkey now of course makes it necessary that Turkey, too, prioritizes defeating and combating ISIS just as the U. S. has been doing. So the U. S. and Turkey will be much more closely aligned as of today than they were before the attack. SIEGEL: Soner Cagaptay of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, thanks for talking with us. CAGAPTAY: It's always a pleasure. ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:  Turkey is no stranger to terrorism. This attack is the latest of more than a dozen in the past year alone. Some of those Turkey has blamed on a Kurdish separatist group it's been fighting for years. Other attacks, including this one, it has blamed on ISIS. Soner Cagaptay is the director of the Turkish Research Program at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, and he says this attack on the airport is different from all the ones that came before. I asked him why. SONER CAGAPTAY: This is the third-busiest airport in Europe, eleventh-busiest in the world and the airport which is the entry point for a majority of the more than 35 million people who visit Turkey. It's also an image of Turkey being a safe place to visit and to do business. So this will not only unfortunately kill Turkey's very lucrative tourism industry, but also it will hurt the country's economic standing, investment credibility.

The country's military says that along with the U. S. -led coalition, it has destroyed hundreds of ISIS vehicles and killed many fighters in the last few days. NPR's Alice Fordham joins us to talk about this from Beirut. Hello. ALICE FORDHAM, BYLINE: Hi, Kelly. MCEVERS: So why is this video getting so much attention? FORDHAM: Well, it's very striking. It's been shot from a plane, and it shows a whole convoy of vehicles being hit there like a row of smoking dots along what looks like a desert road. And the video was shot late Tuesday night. The Air Force says this is a convoy in an area close to the city of Fallujah, really not too far away from Baghdad, as you know. And it's one of several ISIS convoys hit over the last three days. The U. S. -led coalition, as you said, have also been involved in these strikes. They say they took out about 55 vehicles on Tuesday night and 120 yesterday. We haven't seen any confirmation from ISIS yet, but it's certainly true that until recently, they had a big presence in this province, in Anbar Province, and that they have been on the run lately. MCEVERS: All right, so these vehicles in this convoy that were shot in this video, where are they going? FORDHAM: The city of Fallujah was recently lost. And the Iraqi Security Forces and their allies went in and took it back from ISIS. And it seems like from what the Iraqi Security Forces are saying, the ISIS fighters were trying to proceed along the Euphrates River Valley all the way into Syria where ISIS still hold a lot of territory. This is a real time of triumph for Iraqis. Military commanders and the prime minister have been celebrating in Fallujah this week, even though there are still tens of thousands of people from Fallujah displaced, stuck in the desert nearby in inadequate camps. It's not clear when they'll be able to go home. And the provincial capital Ramadi, which was retaken six months ago, much of that still has explosives, it has mines. And that's not really fit for people to go back to either. MCEVERS: So is this a big win for the Iraqi military? FORDHAM: Yeah, well, the Iraqi Security Forces and their allies are definitely making progress. The retaking of Fallujah happened relatively quickly, something in the region of five weeks. And reports indicate that the destruction in the city is nothing like as bad as the destruction in the provincial capital Ramadi were very widely damaged in the fighting. But it's worth noting that it was two years ago this week that ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi announced what he called the caliphate in the largest mosque in the big city of Mosul further north in Iraq. We haven't heard from Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi recently, but ISIS does still hold Mosul. And there's maybe more than five times as many people live there as lived in Fallujah. And it's also maybe worth thinking about the fact that Iraq still doesn't really have a stable political structure to replace ISIS in these areas. There's still something of a political vacuum, which has really slowed down things like reconstruction and reconciliation projects. MCEVERS: That's NPR's Alice Fordham. Thank you.

One was Russian, one Kyrgyz, one Uzbek. Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan are former republics of the Soviet Union. To learn more about what the bombers' origin say about the Islamic State these days, we turn now to Andrew Weiss who specializes in Russia and Eurasia at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and who joins us via Skype. Welcome to the program. ANDREW WEISS: Great to be here. SIEGEL: Are you surprised that this team evidently came from places that used to be in the former Soviet Union? WEISS: Not entirely. Part of the attraction of ISIL seems to be its ideology, and so we've seen radicals from all around the world descend on Syria to fight and to be part of the jihad. There are a significant number of fighters from Russia and other parts of the former Soviet Union. The numbers are not exact, but it's probably in the low thousands. SIEGEL: If ISIS is the draw - is the pull, what's the push out of Uzbekistan or Kyrgyzstan these days? WEISS: The radical movements - the most visible radical movements in that part of the world actually were pushed out about 15 years ago, and they've been largely headquartered in Afghanistan and now in Pakistan since then. Some of them have made jihad and have moved to the Middle East and have been based in Syria or in Turkey. SIEGEL: This is from a Reuters' story about Uzbekistan. It says Uzbekistan has banned beards, outlawed Islamic dress, shut restaurants that refused to sell alcohol and warned teahouses not to celebrate the nightly end of the Ramadan fast with Iftar meals. It sounds like a very anti-religious, anti-Islamic regime in Uzbekistan. WEISS: Absolutely. It's a very authoritarian government and by basically cracking down on people they see as pious Muslims and basically conflating being a pious Muslim with being an Islamic radical, the government probably has a much harder time identifying who it really should be worried about. We should bear in mind that much of the flow of foreign fighters from the former Soviet Union in Dutch Syria is actually gone from Russia to Syria. So what you would most likely see is people tend to be radicalized inside Russia where they're working as migrant workers, and then they somehow find their way to Syria as foreign fighters. SIEGEL: How easy is it for militants to travel from those countries to Islamic state strongholds in Syria? I mean, is it - did you get stopped at border crossings along the way? WEISS: Well, until very recently, until the famous shoot down of the Russian military jet last fall, there was actually visa-free travel between Russia and Turkey. So the amount of Russians who transited back and forth to Turkey was in the hundreds of thousands, if not millions, every year. So that - the transit routes, though, for Islamic fighters are believed to largely go through the South Caucasus and then over land into Turkey. SIEGEL: Turkey and Russia have just made overtures to strengthen what had been tense relations. Do you think there'll be tighter cooperation now between the two on counterterrorism? WEISS: That reconciliation is really only a day or two old. President Putin spoke to President Erdogan just yesterday to bury the hatchet over the shoot down incident last fall. But basically the world's cooperation with Russia on counterterrorism has always been something that looks more attractive in theory than in reality. The Russian approach to counterterrorism has largely focused on basically treating all young men who are socioeconomically dispossessed or who may be religious Muslims as potential terrorist suspects. They've taken a kind of blunt force approach to the problem, which is very different than the way most western governments target terrorist groups. SIEGEL: It sounds, though, from what you're describing that whatever you want to attribute the ability of these bombers to carry off the Istanbul airport attack - if indeed they did - it wasn't lack of a hard line against the movements that they belong to. WEISS: No, but the borders are porous, and we're living in a world where determined transnational terrorist organizations are able to operate. And they're able to maneuver fighters and goods and financial support to places where we're vulnerable. That's just the reality. SIEGEL: Andrew Weiss, thanks for talking with us today.

It's like being in \"Avatar. \" I mean, like, you've got mountains and jungles and animals you've only seen on television. Sometimes you've never even see them on television. I mean, just creatures of all sort everywhere. And then amazing food - sometimes you are eating your food while it's still alive. As a New Mexican, I love my green chili. And there are these tiny little beetles. You pluck the head off, pop them in your mouth, and they taste exactly like green chili. And then the people, man - tattooed on their faces. And they have these really cool, like, nose plug things, and, you know, the guys are dressed in loin cloths. And I think to them, Westerners probably look amazing because not that many people travel through this area. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VILLA: So at the time, I had been travelling for two years. I had lost a ton of weight, gotten even darker than I already am, had stopped shaving, had stopped cutting my hair. And so I had a big fluffy beard atop this really emaciated body, so I kind of looked like an Osama bin Laden Pez dispenser, if you can imagine that. You know, I started hitchhiking through this area and eventually was picked up by this man who told me about this really incredible place. He said it was the most pious, the most religious town in the entire region. And so this area has been heavily religiously colonized by Christian missionaries. And so I arrive at this village, and I put on my backpack. I start walking toward the square. There's this little center square. And normally, when you arrive at a new village, the first people to see you are the children and the animals, and, you know, it's the same reaction. They stare, and then they scamper. And I was expecting that same thing to happen in this village, except it didn't. When I arrived, there were children playing in the square. They looked up, and they saw me. And immediately they all fell to their knees and clasped hands together, right? And so I'm thinking, well, this is new. And I got closer, and one of the children, you know, on his knees - he was looking at this little piece of paper. And he would look at me, and he would look back down at this little pamphlet. And I got close enough to see what was on the pamphlet, and I saw it was an image of Jesus. And that's when it hit me (laughter). They think I'm Jesus. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VILLA: And so I decide to have a little bit of fun, right? So I put one ankle in front of the other. I splayed my arms out nice and wide. I hung my head, let my hair drape over my shoulder to get the full effect. And it had the desired effect. I heard the gasp - right? - of the children. And next thing I know, I'm on the ground writhing in pain because this little kid who had come up to me - he just came up to me, looked up and down and then punched me where it really, really hurts. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VILLA: And this lady comes running at me, and she tells me in English, that was my son. My son angry. My son loved his grandmother. And I'm still thinking, I don't understand, but then she goes on. My son loved his grandmother, and when she died, we told him that Jesus took her away. And so, like, I guess the moral of the story is if you're going to impersonate Jesus, then you better be willing to pay the price.

The Islamic State is claiming responsibility. The attacks come weeks after Iraqi security forces recaptured Fallujah from the Islamic State. To hear more on this, we reached Susannah George. She's a Baghdad correspondent with The Associated Press. I asked her what we know about the attack so far. SUSANNAH GEORGE: This was the deadliest attack in nearly a year. It was a very large bomb. We're hearing it was a pickup truck that was loaded with explosives. But it also struck at one of the busiest times of the year for this particular neighborhood in Baghdad. It's a busy commercial area on your average day. But after sundown during Ramadan, it's completely packed with families and a lot of young people who are out at restaurants, shopping for clothing and hanging out at cafes. So that's one of the reasons that we're seeing this large death toll. SUAREZ: This attack comes just weeks after the Iraqi army recaptured Fallujah, which had been under ISIS control for two and a half years. What does this say about the security situation overall in Iraq? GEORGE: While bombings on a small scale still happen pretty regularly in Baghdad - you know, a few times a week there'll be IED attacks that have, you know, relatively low casualty figures - big attacks like the one that we just saw in Karada, especially in this part of Baghdad, we haven't seen that regularly at all. You know, as you said, Iraq's military was just celebrating this big territorial victory against IS in Fallujah. And so I think a lot of Iraqis were feeling relatively secure. There was a lot of talk here in Baghdad about how the streets were more packed this Ramadan in the evening after people were breaking their daytime fasts than people had seen in recent years. So I think there was a lot of optimism. But it's turning out that these territorial victories that we're seeing on the battlefield against IS, they're not translating into improved security in the capital, in Baghdad. SUAREZ: Is it the same set of security forces both winning on the ground in western and northern Iraq and apparently unable to protect the capital city of the country? GEORGE: Well, those are two very different fights. You know, waging a conventional warfare against IS when it's protecting a city or protecting a certain piece of territory like a road is a very different fight than when it comes to protecting your own city against an insurgent threat. And while the U. S. -led coalition is really helping Iraqi forces out a lot in the fights against IS on the front lines with airstrikes, with a lot of close operational support, when it comes to protecting Baghdad and manning checkpoints, effectively searching cars, sharing intelligence, that's something that Iraqi security forces just aren't getting right. And that's something that they haven't been getting right for more than 10 years. And so that's why you've seen a lot of anger in response to this attack and other large-scale attacks like it. SUAREZ: Well, you've been out and about in Baghdad after the bombing. What's the environment been like? GEORGE: Well, this morning the shock of what had happened, just as the death toll was beginning to jump, turned very, very angry. The prime minister visited the site and his convoy was mobbed. People were shouting insults at him, throwing rocks at the SUVs that brought him to the site. It's not new for Iraqis to be disappointed with their politicians, but this is something that you're seeing more and more as these attacks continue and as the security situation in Baghdad doesn't improve. When we returned to the site later in the day, there wasn't yelling anymore. People were tired. Families who had shown up in the early hours of the day who were hoping to receive news about loved ones who were still there were realizing that they probably weren't going to receive the good news that they were hoping for. So it really was a sense of just fatigue and frustration with these ongoing security flaws that a lot of people blame their corrupt political leadership for.

At least 109 people died when a truck packed with explosives was detonated in a busy shopping area as people were out celebrating Ramadan. ISIS quickly claimed responsibility for the attack. Meanwhile, in Bangladesh, that country begins a two-day period of mourning after 22 people were killed in a terrorist attack on a popular dining spot in that nation's capital. An Islamic State propaganda wing claimed the attackers were affiliated with ISIS. That has yet to be confirmed. We reached out to Bruce Hoffman. He's a terrorism expert at Georgetown University. And I asked him if it was new to see an attack like the one that happened in Bangladesh carried out in the name of ISIS in that part of the world. BRUCE HOFFMAN: I think it is new, and I don't think it's surprising. In recent years - over the past two years - both al-Qaida and ISIS have made significant inroads in Bangladesh. They've seen it as fertile grounds for expansion. There's been over 40 persons killed in terrorist acts, mostly al-Qaida-related, over the past two years. But, of course, ISIS and al-Qaida are competing on a worldwide canvas. So wherever al-Qaida goes, ISIS tends to follow. MARTIN: Is ISIS looking globally for parts of the world, countries that have a history of civil war, of instability, of Islamist movements that they can then exploit? Is that what's happening? HOFFMAN: Absolutely, although I would put it that they're actively looking for opportunities for expansion. And I think that's why often they follow on al-Qaida's heels or sometimes are ahead of al-Qaida. MARTIN: Remind us of the current relationship between al-Qaida and ISIS. HOFFMAN: At the moment, intense rivalry and competition. But, of course, ISIS is an offshoot of al-Qaida, and their ideology isn't completely separate. MARTIN: Of course, the tool the Obama administration has used the most to combat the threat from terrorism, whether ISIS or al-Qaida, is the drone program. We saw on Friday the White House released a long anticipated report about civilian casualties. It seems like a good moment to ask a big question. Has the Obama drone program made us safer? Has it done what it was set out to do? HOFFMAN: I think it has been successful tactically in that I believe it has likely disrupted terrorist attacks, kept terrorists off-balance, compelled them to spend more time looking over their shoulder and being concerned about their own security than in planning and plotting attacks. But I think one also has to say that strategically, it hasn't been successful. Al-Qaida's present in twice as many places today than it was in 2008. ISIS has eight provinces throughout the world and some 50 different affiliates in 21 countries. So it's been successful, perhaps, in minimizing the immediate threats, but I don't think we should confuse activity with strategic progress in actually eliminating the threats that these groups pose. MARTIN: Have you been surprised at how this threat has metastasized over the past decade? HOFFMAN: Yes, absolutely. I've been surprised how it's metastasized over the past five years. It was just in 2011 that virtually everyone at the top of the U. S. government, including the president, was heralding that al-Qaida was on the verge of strategic collapse and implying that we had turned a decisive corner in the war on terrorism. And the situation today, I think, is fundamentally alarming in the sense that since November, we've had really an unprecedented concatenation of terrorist attacks throughout the world that have been enormously lethal. Now, you know, many people say, well, in the 1980s there were far more terrorist attacks than there were today. But that's true. But they were killing in the ones and twos. For instance, in 1985, the Abu Nidal Organization staged a simultaneous attack on the Rome and Vienna airports. It was enormously tragic. Nineteen persons were killed. More than double were killed the other day in Istanbul. And I think that's an important exemplar that terrorism is becoming much more lethal than it's been in the past. It is targeting these soft targets. The other difference between, let's say, a lot of the terrorist attacks in the 1980s and today, those groups were giving warnings. That's what we don't see from these groups. There's no warning involved. They're just out for bloodshed and mayhem. MARTIN: Bruce Hoffman is the director of Security Studies at Georgetown University.

It was on that trip that two of our colleagues were killed in a Taliban ambush, photographer David Gilkey and Zabihullah Tamanna, an interpreter and journalist. The NPR team wanted to see what had changed since last year, when Tom Bowman saw Afghan troops open up on Taliban fighters with artillery. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: Here's water. Here's some water. (SOUNDBITE OF EXPLOSION)SIEGEL: The round fell short by nearly a mile. There's been improvement since then. This summer, an Afghan artillery academy will open. And NPR's Tom Bowman spent time last month with U. S. military trainers instructing the Afghan army on the proper use of artillery and mortars. TOM BOWMAN, BYLINE: This is the final exam for the artillery course held by American military trainers in Kandahar, all under the watchful eye of Major Kevin McCormick. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: (Foreign language spoken). UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: (Foreign language spoken). MAJOR KEVIN MCCORMICK: They did very well. We had a group up on top of the berm identify an enemy location. They successfully called for fire, and the mortar shot off three rounds that landed on target. BOWMAN: What used to be there? MCCORMICK: (Laughter) Used to be some broken down vehicle, but it's gone. BOWMAN: Was it a Russian vehicle? MCCORMICK: I don't know if it was Russian or not, but it has disappeared. BOWMAN: What has not disappeared is a U. S. and ally training effort now going on for about a decade. But the higher-level skills, such as employing effective artillery fire, are only now being taught in a systemic way. Effective artillery fire is vital for the Afghans or any army. You want to be able to hit your enemy with what's called indirect fire before he can hit you. That's why artillery is known as the King of Battle. MCCORMICK: It takes a long time. It's not a short process. These skills are perishable, so they require continuous training, continuous mastery to be proficient. BOWMAN: Continuous training - that's what's been going on all year at this vast and flat desert range. It's where Osama bin Laden also trained his fighters. McCormick and the instructors are wrapping up the seventh class of the year for the Afghan army's 205th Corps. Each one is 14 days. And that training can quickly evaporate. That's because the Afghan army is suffering high numbers of dead and wounded in its fight against the Taliban. Many other soldiers simply quit or desert. MCCORMICK: There's always an influx of new Afghan soldiers coming in, so making sure that the 205th Corps has the capability to sustain their proficiency using artillery, using air assets to employ the capabilities that the Taliban don't have. BOWMAN: Another challenge for artillery trainers? Large numbers of Afghans are illiterate. And it's not just the regular soldiers, says Afghan Army First Lieutenant Hayatullah Froton. HAYATULLAH FROTON: And still now we have a lot of officers, a lot of generals - they don't know how to write, how to read. And leadership is very, very important. So I'm young officer. If my brigade commander, he is general, he don't know how to lead us, use us - so what can I do? It's the most unfortunate problem that we have in our military and our country. BOWMAN: Artillery skills require technical prowess, all the more difficult when you have a limited education. A firing team must be able to calculate the correct coordinates, adjust the weapon's targeting mechanism, choose the correct fuse. So the trainers need some patience. And they're not only Americans. Some come from NATO countries. One of them is Romanian Master Sergeant Mihail Costel. He's learned a few words of Dari to help with the training. MIHAIL COSTEL: (Laughter) I have the notebook, I have the pen. I'm write everything what - new words and new words I didn't understand. (Foreign language spoken). UNIDENTIFIED MAN #4: (Foreign language spoken). UNIDENTIFIED MAN #5: (Foreign language spoken). UNIDENTIFIED MAN #6: (Foreign language spoken). UNIDENTIFIED MAN #7: (Foreign language spoken). COSTEL: (Foreign language spoken). BOWMAN: Sergeant Costel assembles his firing team, four Afghans standing in a line. They pass along a training mortar shell. What they're using is a water bottle in place of a mortar round. They actually dropped it into the tube. Then they start all over. They're doing well? COSTEL: Yes, very good. Very good. Today, I have more time for rehearsal. BOWMAN: Sergeant Costel might have time, but the Afghan government does not. The Taliban fighting season is now in full swing, and those artillery skills will be needed in the field. Just a two-hour drive from here, the Taliban is gaining ground. Tom Bowman, NPR News.

The NPR team wanted to see what had changed since last year, when Tom Bowman saw Afghan troops open up on Taliban fighters with artillery. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: Here's water. Here's some water. (SOUNDBITE OF EXPLOSION) SIEGEL: The round fell short by nearly a mile. There's been improvement since then. This summer, an Afghan artillery academy will open. And NPR's Tom Bowman spent time last month with U. S. military trainers instructing the Afghan army on the proper use of artillery and mortars. TOM BOWMAN, BYLINE: This is the final exam for the artillery course held by American military trainers in Kandahar, all under the watchful eye of Major Kevin McCormick. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: (Foreign language spoken). UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: (Foreign language spoken). MAJOR KEVIN MCCORMICK: They did very well. We had a group up on top of the berm identify an enemy location. They successfully called for fire, and the mortar shot off three rounds that landed on target. BOWMAN: What used to be there? MCCORMICK: (Laughter) Used to be some broken down vehicle, but it's gone. BOWMAN: Was it a Russian vehicle? MCCORMICK: I don't know if it was Russian or not, but it has disappeared. BOWMAN: What has not disappeared is a U. S. and ally training effort now going on for about a decade. But the higher-level skills, such as employing effective artillery fire, are only now being taught in a systemic way. Effective artillery fire is vital for the Afghans or any army. You want to be able to hit your enemy with what's called indirect fire before he can hit you. That's why artillery is known as the King of Battle. MCCORMICK: It takes a long time. It's not a short process. These skills are perishable, so they require continuous training, continuous mastery to be proficient. BOWMAN: Continuous training - that's what's been going on all year at this vast and flat desert range. It's where Osama bin Laden also trained his fighters. McCormick and the instructors are wrapping up the seventh class of the year for the Afghan army's 205th Corps. Each one is 14 days. And that training can quickly evaporate. That's because the Afghan army is suffering high numbers of dead and wounded in its fight against the Taliban. Many other soldiers simply quit or desert. MCCORMICK: There's always an influx of new Afghan soldiers coming in, so making sure that the 205th Corps has the capability to sustain their proficiency using artillery, using air assets to employ the capabilities that the Taliban don't have. BOWMAN: Another challenge for artillery trainers? Large numbers of Afghans are illiterate. And it's not just the regular soldiers, says Afghan Army First Lieutenant Hayatullah Froton. HAYATULLAH FROTON: And still now we have a lot of officers, a lot of generals - they don't know how to write, how to read. And leadership is very, very important. So I'm young officer. If my brigade commander, he is general, he don't know how to lead us, use us - so what can I do? It's the most unfortunate problem that we have in our military and our country. BOWMAN: Artillery skills require technical prowess, all the more difficult when you have a limited education. A firing team must be able to calculate the correct coordinates, adjust the weapon's targeting mechanism, choose the correct fuse. So the trainers need some patience. And they're not only Americans. Some come from NATO countries. One of them is Romanian Master Sergeant Mihail Costel. He's learned a few words of Dari to help with the training. MIHAIL COSTEL: (Laughter) I have the notebook, I have the pen. I'm write everything what - new words and new words I didn't understand. (Foreign language spoken). UNIDENTIFIED MAN #4: (Foreign language spoken). UNIDENTIFIED MAN #5: (Foreign language spoken). UNIDENTIFIED MAN #6: (Foreign language spoken). UNIDENTIFIED MAN #7: (Foreign language spoken). COSTEL: (Foreign language spoken). BOWMAN: Sergeant Costel assembles his firing team, four Afghans standing in a line. They pass along a training mortar shell. What they're using is a water bottle in place of a mortar round. They actually dropped it into the tube. Then they start all over. They're doing well? COSTEL: Yes, very good. Very good. Today, I have more time for rehearsal. BOWMAN: Sergeant Costel might have time, but the Afghan government does not. The Taliban fighting season is now in full swing, and those artillery skills will be needed in the field. Just a two-hour drive from here, the Taliban is gaining ground.

The Interior Ministry says to NPR at least 172 people died, and other estimates are even higher. The attack was claimed by ISIS, and it came as the extremists are suffering on the battlefield and losing ground. NPR's Alice Fordham joins us from Beirut, Lebanon, where she's been monitoring the developments. Good morning. ALICE FORDHAM, BYLINE: Good morning. MONTAGNE: So we saw pictures of Iraqi security forces celebrating victories against ISIS in recent weeks and even an entire convoy of ISIS fighters destroyed in air strikes. So how are they able to do such a huge and damaging attack like this? FORDHAM: You're right. ISIS just lost the city of Fallujah which was a huge blow to them. I'm not saying that there's a direct connection between the loss of Fallujah and this truck bombing because, as I understand it, such attacks take weeks or months of planning. But as ISIS loses the territory that they were administering as their self-declared state, we have seen a rise in insurgent tactics. They are taking some of that energy that they were putting into running these areas and putting it into bombings often in Baghdad, also in other parts of the country. And so while from some - one perspective driving ISIS out of towns and cities is a victory for the Iraqi security forces and for the U. S. -led coalition, for many Iraqis, actually, it doesn't necessarily have an immediately positive impact, which kind of indicates maybe a difference in priorities or perspectives depending on whether you're in - on the ground in Iraq or not. MONTAGNE: Well, what kind of difference actually in priorities? FORDHAM: Well, so the coalition is focused on destroying ISIS, and they're using air power and they're backing local forces in Iraq and Syria to drive ISIS out of its strongholds like Fallujah. And that's in large part because that group is more of a threat to the West than all the other groups operating in Iraq and Syria. But if you were actually in Iraq, if you're an Iraqi person, there's a lot of people who are frightened of the chaos that comes after ISIS is kicked out of their areas because, as I said, the militants turn to insurgency and also because there are civilians that stream out of these ISIS-held areas during the battles. They often can't go back to their houses quickly because large parts of their city are destroyed or rigged with explosives. Millions of people already like this in Iraq and as there are more battles against ISIS, aid agents predict we're going to see hundreds of thousands more. And there's a security dimension to this which is that ISIS operatives can hide among these civilians and equally in a country with a strained economy, it's really hard to look after these people and politically it's proved very difficult to run these host ISIS areas. So it's chaotic. MONTAGNE: What, though, about the city of Mosul - it's been held by ISIS for two years. Iraq's army has been talking about taking it back. Is it getting anywhere near ready to do that? FORDHAM: Yeah. They think so. The prime minister said in Fallujah that the assault on Mosul would come soon, and it's begun to a limited degree already, but there's likely to be a lot more supports now. There's hundreds of thousands of people living in Mosul. There's concerns that the problems of civilians fleeing Fallujah and there not really being a plan to house them and to water them in the desert. It will be repeated on a bigger scale in Fallujah, so the defeat of ISIS in Iraq is getting closer, although stability isn't necessarily. MONTAGNE: NPR's Alice Fordham speaking to us from Beirut.

He recently spent a month in the country on a reporting trip that claimed the lives of two of our colleagues, photographer David Gilkey and interpreter Zabihullah Tamanna, an Afghan journalist. Tom is with me in the studio. Hey, Tom. TOM BOWMAN, BYLINE: Hey, David. GREENE: I guess the first question I have for you is - how hard was it to turn to the journalism after what happened there? BOWMAN: You know, frankly, it wasn't all that hard, I mean, once we got David and Zabi home, once we knew we were safe. You wanted to focus on the journalism. That's why you went there in the first place. There's almost this fierce desire to finish these stories. GREENE: David always talked about wanting to get back to that country. And he, like you, I mean, seemed even more determined recently because there was a feeling of a lot of Western journalists sort of pulling out and not telling the story of this war. BOWMAN: That hit David especially hard - that everyone was leaving, that the networks wouldn't go anymore. You have some of the larger newspapers here. But people largely had forgotten about the story. Journalism had pretty much forgotten about it and then focused on ISIS now or something else. But the story's still out there. There are 10,000 American troops there. And this year, they're actually leaning forward more, helping the Afghans. They're going to be closer to the front lines. There are going to be more American airstrikes to try to push back the Taliban. So if anything, the story's more important because the Americans are getting more involved than they were last year. GREENE: So you were in the south of the country and targeted by the Taliban, which is where David and Zabi were killed. What does that tell us about the state of the country right now. I mean, what's it like there? BOWMAN: Well, it's still very dangerous in this area, Helmand Province, where the Marines lost a lot of their comrades over the years. Last year, the Afghans were in complete control of their own security. And consequently, the Taliban pushed in, grabbed a lot of the areas where a lot of Marines died - where the Marines had fought for. So this year, the Americans sent trainers out there to Helmand Province. They're going to do more airstrikes. And they're completely rebuilding the Afghan 215th Corps, who we spent a lot of time with out there. And that's one of the stories we worked on. So it's more dangerous, really, than it was when we were there three, four, five years ago. GREENE: More dangerous - I mean, what does that tell us about the future? I mean, what is the best hope for this country I mean, now that it's in a place where, you know, we've had this withdraw of U. S. forces? I mean, there's still a presence there. The country is supposed to be sort of taking on the role of security on its own. I mean, what's the best hope? BOWMAN: You know, I talk to a lot of people about Afghanistan, people who have spent years there - civilians and military. And the consensus seems to be that the cities will be able to push back the Taliban - that the cities will be safe - relatively safe. They'll - and the highways will be able to be maintained. But in the countryside, it will largely be a pretty strong insurgency. The Taliban will still hold sway outside the major cities. That's the best case scenario. And that's a long way from what American officials had told the American people they expected and hoped for back in 2002. GREENE: Tom, I know we'll be hearing your stories on this show and also on All Things Considered. And I am looking forward to them because, I mean, this is what David would have wanted - to get this journalism on the air. And, you know, this has been a tough period for all of us here.

Today, we hear about Afghanistan's poppy production, which accounts for more than 90 percent of the world's heroin. The profits of this go to the Taliban to pay fighters, to buy weapons and also to pay off government officials. Now the new governor of the top poppy growing area has an idea. Have the Afghan government control the poppy harvest by licensing farmers and processing the poppies for medical morphine to be used in hospitals. Governor Hayatullah Hayat of Helmand province told NPR this plan could relieve a worldwide need for morphine. HAYATULLAH HAYAT: I know this will take very long time with the security situation that we have in this country. But I think that is an option which can be worked, at least in the areas where we have security. GREENE: Our colleague Tom Bowman was recently in Afghanistan. And that's where he spoke with the governor about this idea. Hey, Tom. TOM BOWMAN, BYLINE: Hey. Good morning, David. GREENE: So is this idea brand new? BOWMAN: You know, it's not. It's been around for nearly a decade, but there's been no movement. Advocates say having the government take over production would serve two purposes. Bring in more money for Afghanistan, where the economy right now is based on foreign handouts and opium, and also take that money away from the Taliban. Right now, medical morphine for hospitals in the developed world comes mostly from Turkey, India and Australia. So experts, even some lawmakers, said this might be a good idea for Afghanistan. Now here's Senator Dianne Feinstein of California back in 2009. She chaired the Senate Caucus on International Narcotics Control. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH)DIANNE FEINSTEIN: Actually, the manufacturing of some poppy for morphine in a very controlled way seems to me - would make some sense. It would have to be a strictly government-regulated industry. BOWMAN: But there has been opposition from the State Department, though. A State Department official said the department still supports destroying the entire poppy crop, even though that hasn't happened in years. The department also cautions that some portion of any legal poppy crop might be diverted to the illegal market. And of course, right now, 100 percent of that crop's in the hands of the Taliban and drug traffickers. And the department also said there's enough morphine being produced elsewhere. There's really no demand. GREENE: No - I mean, there's no demand for medical morphine around the world? BOWMAN: Well, there's no shortage in the U. S. or Europe. But there are shortages elsewhere - Africa, China and also Afghanistan itself. I spoke with Jorrit Kamminga. He's an international counternarcotics expert in Holland. And this is what he had to say. JORRIT KAMMINGA: Countries like Afghanistan - they fail to address moderate and severe pains because of the fact that they don't have any morphine, which is still the gold standard of painkilling medicines. GREENE: OK. So debate here, Tom, about how much demand there would be for medical morphine, which would be key to a new program like this. Let's just take the State Department's argument that there's not enough demand. What about just eradicating the poppies in Afghanistan? BOWMAN: Well, they've tried that over the years. The U. S. has spent billions of dollars eradicating the poppy. Also, the Afghan government has been involved in this effort to get rid of the poppy crop. But it's in fits and starts. Now, this year, we were just in Helmand Province. The entire poppy crop was grown and is now being processed into opium and heroin. They didn't touch the poppy crop this year. GREENE: Might tell you why the governor is so determined to do something right now. So, I mean, could this be the moment of momentum where he gets an idea like this - gets it through? BOWMAN: Well, it could be. Again, there's resistance in the U. S. to doing this. But he would like to at least have a pilot project. He also wants to do things like grow watermelons, wheat, cotton. The problem with cotton is - there's a law in the U. S. that - you can't support overseas programs that compete with American cotton farmers. GREENE: Tom, thanks a lot. BOWMAN: You're welcome. DAVID GREENE, HOST:  This week, we're taking a look at the ongoing war in Afghanistan, where 15 years later, there are still 10,000 American troops on the ground. Today, we hear about Afghanistan's poppy production, which accounts for more than 90 percent of the world's heroin. The profits of this go to the Taliban to pay fighters, to buy weapons and also to pay off government officials. Now the new governor of the top poppy growing area has an idea. Have the Afghan government control the poppy harvest by licensing farmers and processing the poppies for medical morphine to be used in hospitals. Governor Hayatullah Hayat of Helmand province told NPR this plan could relieve a worldwide need for morphine. HAYATULLAH HAYAT: I know this will take very long time with the security situation that we have in this country. But I think that is an option which can be worked, at least in the areas where we have security. GREENE: Our colleague Tom Bowman was recently in Afghanistan. And that's where he spoke with the governor about this idea. Hey, Tom. TOM BOWMAN, BYLINE: Hey. Good morning, David. GREENE: So is this idea brand new? BOWMAN: You know, it's not. It's been around for nearly a decade, but there's been no movement. Advocates say having the government take over production would serve two purposes. Bring in more money for Afghanistan, where the economy right now is based on foreign handouts and opium, and also take that money away from the Taliban. Right now, medical morphine for hospitals in the developed world comes mostly from Turkey, India and Australia. So experts, even some lawmakers, said this might be a good idea for Afghanistan. Now here's Senator Dianne Feinstein of California back in 2009. She chaired the Senate Caucus on International Narcotics Control.

They agreed to send military units to Poland and the Baltic states. People in those three small NATO countries on Russia's western border - Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania - have vivid memories of living under Soviet occupation. As Corey Flintoff reports from Vilnius, Lithuanians say they're ready to resist any Russian aggression. COREY FLINTOFF, BYLINE: It's possible to cross Lithuania by car in a little over four hours, and people here know they could be overrun very quickly if Russia ever chose to attack. NATO allies are pledged to come to its defense, but the country could be firmly in Russian hands by that point. That's why the defense minister, Juozas Olekas, says Lithuanians don't plan to sit around waiting for help. He recalls that Lithuanian partisans fought a nearly 10-year guerilla war against the Soviet occupation after World War II. JUOZAS OLEKAS: Our civilian men and women in the forest - they fight for our freedom. And in this situation, our civilian society - they are ready to defend their country. FLINTOFF: Lithuania has a professional army of only about 8,000 soldiers, but it also has a civilian draft. Conscription for both men and women was reinstated in 2014 after Russia seized the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine. The plan is to draft up to 4,000 people each year for nine months of tough military training. So far, most of the trainees are young people who volunteered for the draft. We caught up with some of them at an army base near Vilnius where draftees are in their seventh month of training. They're hidden in the forest to provide stealthy communications for an artillery battalion. The first sign that there's a military operation here comes when a camouflage sentry materializes from among the trees.

FLINTOFF: He says he has the feeling that conflict with Russia could break out at any time, and he wants to be ready. Julija Gailliusaite volunteered for the draft at 19 because she says she wanted to give herself a challenge and give something to the country. She says it was much harder than she imagined. JULIJA GAILLIUSAITE: (Through interpreter) I can see now that every one of us has gotten better. We can't catch up to the professional soldiers, but I think we're getting some respect from them. They're not thinking of us as civilians anymore. We're soldiers now. FLINTOFF: Grinkevicius says he's heartened by the fact that NATO soldiers from other countries are now training regularly in Lithuania. Right now, he says, his base has Danish, Portuguese and German troops. GRINKEVICIUS: I see them every day, so it is the feeling that we are not alone in the world.

S. commitment in Afghanistan. Since the fall of the Taliban in 2001, the U. S. has had thousands of troops there. Despite a plan to withdraw most of them by this coming January, President Obama says he will keep more soldiers in Afghanistan longer than he planned. He made this announcement this past week. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Instead of going down to 5,500 troops by the end of this year, the United States will maintain approximately 8,400 troops in Afghanistan into next year, through the end of my administration. MARTIN: The president did point to some successes in Afghanistan, but he acknowledged the Taliban had retaken some parts of the country. There is still the threat from ISIS and al-Qaida. We are joined by someone with long experience in Afghanistan. Sarah Chayes covered the fall of the Taliban for NPR. Afterwards, she remained in the country to start a manufacturing co-op. And later, she went on to work as special assistant to chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mike Mullen. Chayes is now a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, and she joins me now. Thanks for being with us, Sarah. SARAH CHAYES: Thanks for having me. MARTIN: The U. S. has spent $65 billion building up Afghan security forces over so many years now. And we hear all the time about how U. S. forces are increasingly standing down so Afghan troops can stand up. But they seem to be faltering. After so much time, so much investment, why? CHAYES: I think the problem is that this isn't fundamentally a tactical problem. Troops are only an instrument in the hands of a government. And so if the government is so either dysfunctional or actively hostile to its own population, it's really hard to imagine how an army can become a stronger and more professional organization belonging to that government. MARTIN: What do you think about the idea of keeping this number of U. S. troops on the ground in Afghanistan? Do you think it's a footprint that's too big? Is it too small? CHAYES: I don't think it makes any difference. I think zero has a certain psychological impact on Afghans. But the difference between 2,000 or 5,000 or 8,000 is absolutely immaterial. I think this decision is entirely aimed at the United States. If the president were to continue drawing down and if something blew up, it could be blamed on his decision to draw down. MARTIN: You lived in Afghanistan. I imagine you still keep in touch with some friends who are there. What do they tell you about what kind of presence they want to see from the U. S. in the short and long term? CHAYES: Most of my friends would prefer more rather than less U. S. presence, but they all agree that this isn't the heart of the problem. And they literally said the problem here is administrative corruption. If you people don't fix the administration of this country, you can send 100,000 - you can send a million soldiers here - it's - you're never going to get security. MARTIN: OK. So allegations of widespread corruption. What does that look like in Afghanistan today, in 2016? What kind of examples can you give? CHAYES: It means every time you interact with a government official, you get shaken down for money. As part of the counterinsurgency process, we put, you know, more soldiers out into villages. The soldiers would steal the wood. They steal your produce. Police shake you down - you know, several checkpoints - three to five checkpoints on an hour and a half drive. You have to pay bribes to pay your electricity bill. And the other thing that's really important to bear in mind is, you know, when a cop shakes you down for money, he doesn't do it politely. I mean, think about that young man in Tunisia who had been slapped in the face by a police officer who was shaking him down. And he lit himself on fire, and we got the Arab Spring. I mean, this is what is generating a lot of the support for the Taliban. MARTIN: Ashraf Ghani is the new president. He's got strong ties to the U. S. , but does he want the U. S. telling him what to do? CHAYES: Of course not. But I do think it is possible to relook all of the ways that we continue to interact with Afghanistan and figure out how, at least, to shape those interactions so that at least they don't reinforce corrupt practices and where Ashraf Ghani seems to be making a good faith effort to address the problem, to support him, but don't give him a blank check. Don't take anybody at face value. MARTIN: Sarah Chayes is a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Her most recent book is titled \"Thieves Of State: Why Corruption Threatens Global Security. \" Sarah, thanks so much. CHAYES: Pleasure. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:  But now we're going to turn to the U.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)RECEP TAYYIP ERDOGAN: (Foreign language spoken). SHAPIRO: His comments are being broadcast by Turkey's Fox TV apparently recorded earlier in the evening. Erdogan says the uprising was carried out by a minority within the military who can't stomach the country's unity. He also said tonight's events will be a reason to clean up the army. He says he will stay with his people, that he isn't going anywhere. And he said those responsible will pay a heavy price for their treason. Dion Nissenbaum is a Wall Street Journal correspondent based in Istanbul. Welcome to the program. DION NISSENBAUM: Thanks, Ari. SHAPIRO: Before these latest comments were broadcast, President Erdogan landed in Istanbul, got in a vehicle, came out and greeted supporters. What did he say, and what kind of reception did he receive? NISSENBAUM: He's been greeted by thousands of supporters who flooded the airport to welcome him. They heeded his call early in the coup attempt to head to the streets and defy the military, and they did. In remarkable scenes, they swarmed over tanks. They headed to the airport. They were wrestling in the streets with soldiers - amazing scenes both in support of the president but also in opposition to the military coup. SHAPIRO: The government clearly seems to be asserting its control. And yet at the same time, there are reports of explosions in the parliament building in the capital, Ankara, and apparently President Erdogan has said his general secretary was abducted by the people behind the coup. He has no information on the chief of the military staff. It does not sound like this is over by any stretch. NISSENBAUM: No, this definitely is not over. It seems at this hour that President Erdogan has the support of the military chief of staff and the majority of the military. But the coup plotters are not going to give up without a fight. This is going to literally be a fight for their lives. They will be tried for treason for this, and there's no reason for them to give up without a fight. And we are hearing explosions and jet fighters overhead, and this is not over. SHAPIRO: Is this a fight for their lives in the streets or in the courtroom? Are you talking about something that resembles a civil war or merely a dissenting faction? NISSENBAUM: Those are the questions that are going to be answered in the coming hours, Ari. I think if you're a military coup leader and you see that you're failing. You have to realize that you'll either have to fight for your lives when the - when Erdogan's allies come for you, or you'll be hanged as a traitor by the government after a court proceeding. So it is a fight for their lives one way or another. And you know, there was an interesting comment made to President Erdogan at the press conference today as he was speaking. It was a - guy got up and said, I'm a Kurd, and I'm standing with you. And the Kurds are his enemies out there, you know? The Kurds could stand to lose a lot from this at the end because Erdogan sees their political leaders as terrorists. So you're seeing a remarkable unity here in support of Turkey's democracy as much as in support of President Erdogan. SHAPIRO: And yet does Turkey's democracy emerge with a more authoritarian sheen if this coup attempt does in fact fail? NISSENBAUM: Right. I think that's the - sort of the tragedy of this now, is that it frees President Erdogan to crack down even further on his dissidents, on the Kurds, on the secularists, on journalists who report on his actions. It gives him a free hand to do much more. And he basically said tonight that this is the beginning of an even tougher crackdown on the people that are his opponents. SHAPIRO: It seems as though the media has been a pawn all night long with the state broadcaster first being seized by the military then reclaimed by the government forces. And CNN Turk at one point was broadcasting President Erdogan via FaceTime on a cell phone. And then at one point the network went dark. What is happening there? NISSENBAUM: Yeah, it's remarkable, remarkable scenes here. CNN Turk was just broadcasting an empty studio for what seemed like an eternity. And you could hear the journalists fighting, arguing with the coup plotters off the set. Apparently someone was even - one of the journalists was even injured in those arguments. But you just had a gripping scene of an empty CNN Turk set, and you could hear the argument going on over Turkey's democracy off to the side. It's things I've never seen myself. It's incredible. SHAPIRO: Well, what's the sense in Istanbul at this moment where you are? Are you still hearing any gunfire or explosions? NISSENBAUM: So I'm not far from Taksim Square, which was the main center of the Gezi Park protest against President Erdogan in 2013. And the streets here are deserted. This is a part of the city that would be lively into the evening. There's very few cars in the streets. There have been F-16s overhead carrying out massive, jarring sonic booms. But right now it is quiet, and I think we're in the - you know, I think everybody wants to see where this is headed when the sun comes up. SHAPIRO: Turkey's obviously such an important country, a member of NATO and more. What are the implications for American interests? NISSENBAUM: Right, well, if President Erdogan emerges unscathed and things sort of return to normal, this this will sort of stabilize for the U. S. government. This is of course this site of Incirlik Air Base, which is the main hub for U. S. coalition air strikes against Islamic State in neighboring Syria and Iraq. And that's an important ally in the fight against Islamic State. This is at the epicenter of the efforts to contain the global refugee crisis. So it - we'll have to see how things end up. It's going to be shaky for a while. But the leader of the military has backed President Erdogan. He is seen as pro-Western. And it does seem at this point that it is a minority within the military that has carried this out. And so the military itself as an institution may retain its stature. SHAPIRO: We should note that the White House, the Obama administration have expressed support for Turkey's democratically elected government. Secretary of State - former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has said the same thing. Donald Trump earlier this evening tweeted that people were taking their country back as they may soon do in the United States - obviously a lot of interest in what is happening but also a tremendous amount at stake not just in Turkey but around the world. NISSENBAUM: Yeah, it's a gripping time. We're not going to know where things are headed until morning. This is not what the U. S. needs. SHAPIRO: So many of the reports we've heard tonight have been from Istanbul and the capital, Ankara. Do you have a sense of what else is happening in other parts of the country? This is a country of 75 million people. NISSENBAUM: Yeah, it's - we don't know a lot, you know? We've been a bit consumed by what's been happening in Ankara and Istanbul. There was a sense that there was not much of a move in other parts of the country as there was in Ankara and Istanbul. But like any country, there's - you know, the major cities are where things are turned, and that's what we saw today. SHAPIRO: Dion Nissenbaum with the Wall Street Journal speaking with us from Istanbul, thank you very much. NISSENBAUM: Thank you. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:  Turkish television is carrying comments from President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after hours of uncertainty which began with a declaration by armed forces that they were taking over the country. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) RECEP TAYYIP ERDOGAN: (Foreign language spoken). SHAPIRO: His comments are being broadcast by Turkey's Fox TV apparently recorded earlier in the evening. Erdogan says the uprising was carried out by a minority within the military who can't stomach the country's unity. He also said tonight's events will be a reason to clean up the army. He says he will stay with his people, that he isn't going anywhere. And he said those responsible will pay a heavy price for their treason. Dion Nissenbaum is a Wall Street Journal correspondent based in Istanbul. Welcome to the program. DION NISSENBAUM: Thanks, Ari. SHAPIRO: Before these latest comments were broadcast, President Erdogan landed in Istanbul, got in a vehicle, came out and greeted supporters. What did he say, and what kind of reception did he receive? NISSENBAUM: He's been greeted by thousands of supporters who flooded the airport to welcome him. They heeded his call early in the coup attempt to head to the streets and defy the military, and they did. In remarkable scenes, they swarmed over tanks. They headed to the airport. They were wrestling in the streets with soldiers - amazing scenes both in support of the president but also in opposition to the military coup. SHAPIRO: The government clearly seems to be asserting its control. And yet at the same time, there are reports of explosions in the parliament building in the capital, Ankara, and apparently President Erdogan has said his general secretary was abducted by the people behind the coup. He has no information on the chief of the military staff. It does not sound like this is over by any stretch. NISSENBAUM: No, this definitely is not over. It seems at this hour that President Erdogan has the support of the military chief of staff and the majority of the military. But the coup plotters are not going to give up without a fight. This is going to literally be a fight for their lives. They will be tried for treason for this, and there's no reason for them to give up without a fight. And we are hearing explosions and jet fighters overhead, and this is not over. SHAPIRO: Is this a fight for their lives in the streets or in the courtroom? Are you talking about something that resembles a civil war or merely a dissenting faction? NISSENBAUM: Those are the questions that are going to be answered in the coming hours, Ari. I think if you're a military coup leader and you see that you're failing. You have to realize that you'll either have to fight for your lives when the - when Erdogan's allies come for you, or you'll be hanged as a traitor by the government after a court proceeding. So it is a fight for their lives one way or another. And you know, there was an interesting comment made to President Erdogan at the press conference today as he was speaking. It was a - guy got up and said, I'm a Kurd, and I'm standing with you. And the Kurds are his enemies out there, you know? The Kurds could stand to lose a lot from this at the end because Erdogan sees their political leaders as terrorists. So you're seeing a remarkable unity here in support of Turkey's democracy as much as in support of President Erdogan. SHAPIRO: And yet does Turkey's democracy emerge with a more authoritarian sheen if this coup attempt does in fact fail? NISSENBAUM: Right. I think that's the - sort of the tragedy of this now, is that it frees President Erdogan to crack down even further on his dissidents, on the Kurds, on the secularists, on journalists who report on his actions. It gives him a free hand to do much more. And he basically said tonight that this is the beginning of an even tougher crackdown on the people that are his opponents. SHAPIRO: It seems as though the media has been a pawn all night long with the state broadcaster first being seized by the military then reclaimed by the government forces. And CNN Turk at one point was broadcasting President Erdogan via FaceTime on a cell phone. And then at one point the network went dark. What is happening there? NISSENBAUM: Yeah, it's remarkable, remarkable scenes here. CNN Turk was just broadcasting an empty studio for what seemed like an eternity. And you could hear the journalists fighting, arguing with the coup plotters off the set. Apparently someone was even - one of the journalists was even injured in those arguments. But you just had a gripping scene of an empty CNN Turk set, and you could hear the argument going on over Turkey's democracy off to the side. It's things I've never seen myself. It's incredible. SHAPIRO: Well, what's the sense in Istanbul at this moment where you are? Are you still hearing any gunfire or explosions? NISSENBAUM: So I'm not far from Taksim Square, which was the main center of the Gezi Park protest against President Erdogan in 2013. And the streets here are deserted. This is a part of the city that would be lively into the evening. There's very few cars in the streets. There have been F-16s overhead carrying out massive, jarring sonic booms. But right now it is quiet, and I think we're in the - you know, I think everybody wants to see where this is headed when the sun comes up. SHAPIRO: Turkey's obviously such an important country, a member of NATO and more. What are the implications for American interests? NISSENBAUM: Right, well, if President Erdogan emerges unscathed and things sort of return to normal, this this will sort of stabilize for the U. S. government. This is of course this site of Incirlik Air Base, which is the main hub for U. S. coalition air strikes against Islamic State in neighboring Syria and Iraq. And that's an important ally in the fight against Islamic State. This is at the epicenter of the efforts to contain the global refugee crisis. So it - we'll have to see how things end up. It's going to be shaky for a while. But the leader of the military has backed President Erdogan. He is seen as pro-Western. And it does seem at this point that it is a minority within the military that has carried this out. And so the military itself as an institution may retain its stature. SHAPIRO: We should note that the White House, the Obama administration have expressed support for Turkey's democratically elected government. Secretary of State - former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has said the same thing. Donald Trump earlier this evening tweeted that people were taking their country back as they may soon do in the United States - obviously a lot of interest in what is happening but also a tremendous amount at stake not just in Turkey but around the world. NISSENBAUM: Yeah, it's a gripping time. We're not going to know where things are headed until morning. This is not what the U. S. needs. SHAPIRO: So many of the reports we've heard tonight have been from Istanbul and the capital, Ankara. Do you have a sense of what else is happening in other parts of the country? This is a country of 75 million people. NISSENBAUM: Yeah, it's - we don't know a lot, you know? We've been a bit consumed by what's been happening in Ankara and Istanbul.

Secretary of State John Kerry also urged Americans in Turkey to stay indoors. Journalist Dalia Mortada is in Istanbul, and she joins us now via Skype. Welcome to the program. DALIA MORTADA: Thank you, Ari. SHAPIRO: Such a chaotic night with so much uncertainty - can you say who is controlling the country right now? MORTADA: The question - I wish the question was much more - you know, the answer to that question was much more simple. I think - the government is controlling the country right now. We still have the President Recep Tayyip Erdogan as the president. There is a lot of activity. There is a lot of confusion going on. But it does appear that the coup - the attempted coup has not succeeded, at least not as of right now. SHAPIRO: And yet at the same time we are getting reports that in the capital Ankara, the parliament building has been hit by explosions. What can you tell us about that? MORTADA: Yes, live on television we were witnessing these massive explosions, sparks flying everywhere and large plumes of smoke hitting parliament. There's been reportedly three large explosions like that, but we're not hearing anything from within parliament as to injuries or anything like that. SHAPIRO: And are we to conclude that this is the faction of the military that was trying to overthrow the government attacking Turkey's own parliament? MORTADA: Presumably that's what we're understanding. SHAPIRO: Now, we've also seen crowds in the streets, people taking to Taksim Square, the main square in Istanbul. Have you spoken to people who are out in the streets tonight, and can you tell us what you've heard from them? MORTADA: Well, my neighbors were just milling about in the street. So when the attempted coup began, the military had imposed the - a curfew. And so people - but no one was really abiding by that. People were out in the street talking about what was going on kind of in disbelief. And then later on in the evening, just people took - went inside and are just watching what's going on. No one really expected this to come. That being said, especially after President Erdogan and other leaders in the AKP - the party that governs Turkey - condemned the coup and encouraged people to take to the streets, large groups of supporters of the AKP went to Taksim Square, went to the airport to greet Erdogan coming back from his vacation in Bodrum reportedly and in other parts of the city. SHAPIRO: And you say this was not expected, and yet there were certainly tensions building to this point. MORTADA: Oh, absolutely. There were definitely tensions building to this point, but to the extent that a coup from a faction of the military which has been significantly weakened under Erdogan and the AKP over the last decade and a half just wasn't really on most people's radars. There has been a lot of tension, a lot of political tension. There's been a lot of criticism of the government for consolidating power under Erdogan and - but to this extent, it was definitely not expected. SHAPIRO: All right.

The military has attempted a coup, at one point taking over state TV and declaring martial law. The government now reports that it has taken back the country's broadcaster and arrested several coup-attempting soldiers. The state news agency also now says that an F-16 has shot down a helicopter that was being used by the military. To help us sort out what is happening, we are joined by Henri Barkey. He's the director of the Middle East program at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, and he joins us from Istanbul where it is now 3:30 in the morning. Thank you for staying up and joining us once again. HENRI BARKEY: OK. Thank you. SHAPIRO: What is your sense of what is happening now? Do we know who is in control of the country? BARKEY: Well, from the looks of it, this was a coup attempt not by the military but by a faction in the military. And it was a faction that clearly miscalculated and thought maybe that the rest of the military would join them once they started, and it has failed. And so the current government is in charge, and we will see the repercussions of this in the days and weeks to come. But this is actually a terrible thing for Turkey. I mean, this is a coup attempt where you have no winners. Everybody loses, including the government that survived it. So the repercussions in terms of Turkish constitutional process, repercussions in terms of the self-confidence of Turkey, the repercussions in terms of Erdogan's ability to govern even if he assumes greater powers through a constitutional change (unintelligible) question. And now you have a military which is, you know, is clearly affected. And how do you rebuild that military? How do you - essentially they'll have to purge. And how do you purge it without doing a great deal of damage? SHAPIRO: Can I just ask? From where you're sitting, you say it appears clear that the coup has failed. We're hearing so many different conflicting reports from here. What leads you to that conclusion? BARKEY: Well, I from the beginning did not think that this was a coup that was going to succeed only because I've seen and I've studied Turkish coups in the past. Whenever you have a coup, the high command is always in control. And they move swiftly, and they arrest the prime minister, the president and the cabinet and members of the parliament. This did not happen this time. They - the coup plotters did not know where even - the president was, it seems to me so. So when you have a coup that is so disorganized, it is not likely to succeed. SHAPIRO: Now. . . BARKEY: The only thing - yeah. SHAPIRO: Recep Tayyip Erdogan had been clamping down on civil liberties, press freedoms, freedom of speech before this coup attempt. If in fact he does retain power, what does that imply about the steps he might take next? BARKEY: Well, the interesting thing is that the automatic corollary of this coup is that he's going to increase his powers at the expense of society, expense - at the expense of opponents, at the expense of everybody. That is kind of if you want a linear expectation. But I will submit to you that this president now is much more weakened. Even though he will have probably extra constitutional powers, he's weakened because he's - the face that he projected of an impregnable confident leader is now not there anymore. So he's going to be looking over his shoulder all the time. He's going to be less trusting. He already was not trusting of the opposition. I suspect that relations will get much tenser in Turkey, and he will not be able to govern with consensus. Instead he's going to be governing more and more through dictate, and that is. . .

MICHELE KELEMEN, BYLINE: Hi, Ari. SHAPIRO: Turkey is such an important NATO ally for the U. S. Explain why this is a crucial country as far as America is concerned. KELEMEN: Well, as you said, it is a key ally. I mean, the U. S. military works very closely with Turkey, and that's particularly important now in this fight against ISIS in Syria and Iraq, which is right in that neighborhood. The U. S. uses the Incirlik airbase, and we're told some of those flights are on hold for now as everyone tries to figure out what's happening. So there is a lot at stake here. SHAPIRO: And at the same time, President Obama has had tense relationships for a couple of years with President Erdogan and his team in Turkey. What is at the center of that tension? KELEMEN: Well, he has - and it's partly Syria policy. Erdogan does not like the idea that the U. S. is supporting Kurdish fighters in Syria. And on the other hand, the Obama administration has been very nervous about how Erdogan has been consolidating power, about human rights abuses in the country and a crackdown on the media. SHAPIRO: Some of those issues which may have led to the attempted coup tonight. KELEMEN: That's right. I mean, there was a lot of buildup to this.

And Kerry did manage to get his Turkish counterpart, the foreign minister, on the phone. And the message is basically calling on all sides to show restraint, to respect the democratically elected government, to avoid bloodshed.

S. ally is in chaos tonight in the midst of an attempted coup. Turkey sits at the edge of Asia and Europe. It is a key NATO ally to the United States in the fight against ISIS. It's also a major tourist destination for people from around the world, and Turkey is home to 75 million people. Tonight civilians and soldiers are facing off in the streets of Istanbul and other cities. There are competing claims of who is running the country, the president or the military. The military has taken over a television network and announced that it is placing the country under curfew and martial law. Our next guest, freelance journalist Noah Blaser, is in Istanbul, and he joins us via Skype. Welcome. NOAH BLASER: Hi, Ari. SHAPIRO: Tell us what you've been seeing tonight. BLASER: Just out on the streets, there's been complete chaos in this city. In a space of about three hours, life has gone from normal to governed by checkpoints, confusion over how long this coup may last. People are lining up at some stores to buy water and food. And on the streets there are, you know, these clashes between the government and, you know, police and soldiers trying to overthrow the government. I was just in the square, Taksim Square, which is very center - in the center of Istanbul. And there were protesters. There were police. There were soldiers firing in the air, and it was a scene of incredible chaos. SHAPIRO: Now, the military has declared a curfew and martial law while the government is urging people into the streets to protest. Do people in the streets all seem to be of one mind, or are there two sides converging? BLASER: Well, in fact all four major parties of Parliament have called for their supporters to go on the streets and to oppose the military coup. Turkey is a country that has witnessed three previous military coups, hard military coups. And they have a very - they have a bad connotation in Turkey. And that would be at least really an understatement I think. So I think most people are opposed to this coup currently. And there are people - I can see outside of my window there's a group of hundreds of people facing off against a military checkpoint here. They're shouting slogans, but they don't seem to be slogans just in support of the government but simply against the notion of a military coup. SHAPIRO: So far we've really primarily heard reports from Istanbul and the capital, Ankara. Is there any indication of what is happening in other cities around the country? BLASER: It's more of the same. Turkish media outlets have been showing similar scenes from around the country. The most intense action has been happening in the country's capital, where there are parts that helicopters have fired from the air on protesters, and there have been explosions reported at the state broadcaster. One thing that we do know about the rest of the Turkey is that President Recep Tayyip Erdogan was vacationing in Southern Turkey when this coup attempt happened. He is not in the hands of those who attempted the coup, and so his absence from Ankara has certainly benefited him and been of great detriment to the people attempting this coup. SHAPIRO: That's journalist Noah Blaser speaking with us from Istanbul, covering this attempted coup in Turkey as we wait to find out whether the coup has been successful or not. We will continue bringing you details throughout the night. Noah Blaser, thank you very much. BLASER: Thank you. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:  A vital U.

That is the assessment of Soner Cagaptay. He's the director of the Turkish Research Program at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. He joins us now on the line. Welcome. SONER CAGAPTAY: It's a pleasure to be with you. SHAPIRO: So this is an unfolding situation, and it is not at all clear who is in control of Turkey. You have been talking this evening about two very different possible outcomes. Explain the thinking behind them. CAGAPTAY: So either the coup plot will fail, and tomorrow we'll wake up to a more repressive Erdogan government who will not only crack down on the coup plotters rightfully so but also any potential opposition that remains outside of his power. So Turkey will become an even more oppressive country, even more oppressive under the current government and president. Or the coup plotters will succeed, and it will still become more oppressive then on their military regime - so two bad outcomes unfortunately at this stage, none of which looks to be promising stability. SHAPIRO: We have heard tonight about the military firing on people in Istanbul who were out in the streets. What do you make of those reports, and has anything like that happened in past coups in Turkey? CAGAPTAY: If that's indeed true, that would be very unfortunate. There is no history of the Turkish military firing at its own people even during coup times in the past. Decades ago, that is, when the military carried out coups, it never fired on people. These were carried out very swiftly without any bloodshed, so that would be very dramatic. And I think the call of President Erdogan for his supporters to take on the streets has not only built up public support but has also precipitated some of this violence but as well as the military firing its own people. So it's a very unusual development for people in a country where if this is indeed, as people say, a coup within the military both against the military, against the government, it's unusual because the military is a very hierarchical institution, and it does everything top to bottom. So if this is indeed a military bottom-up process, it goes against everything we know about the military in Turkey. And secondly the fact that the military is firing at its own people and the fact that the people are firing at the military is very unusual because this is a conscript-based military, meaning everybody participate in it. So it's as if people are firing at people in the country. It's almost like an unspoken highly polarized country going through an unspoken, uncalled civil war, unfortunately. SHAPIRO: This is not entirely a surprise. You wrote a piece back in October for the Washington Institute called \"Turkey Is In Serious Trouble,\" and you laid out what you describe as a toxic combination of political polarization, government instability, economic trouble and threats of violence from inside and outside of Turkey. And so what do you make of this moment? Was it inevitable? CAGAPTAY: Unfortunately this had been brewing, this kind of political tensions which have of course produced a result that nobody wanted to see - an attempt by the military to oust the democratically elected government. But it doesn't mean Turkey's tensions will be over tomorrow. This is a highly polarized country, and I think today's events of the people's army firing at the people and people firing back at the army only shows to you that the country's so polarized that these tensions won't go away for a while. That polarization is at least in part due to President Erdogan's electoral strategy. Yes, he does win elections on a platform of economic good governance and conservative social policies, but he's also oppressive of dissent, cracks down on opposition, demonizes groups that won't vote for him and even encourages violence against them. So it has produced a violence-prone political environment. And if you add to this mix attacks by both the PKK and ISIS, two terror groups that are active in Turkey and its neighborhood, of course it does create a very combustive and dangerous environment. My wish is for Turkey to wake up to a stability tomorrow, but unfortunately, analytically speaking, it looks like either way this unfolds it will become a less-free, less-democratic and less-peaceful place at least in the short-term. SHAPIRO: That's Soner Cagaptay, director of the Turkish Research Program at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. Of course we will continue to update this story as it unfolds throughout the night and beyond. Soner Cagaptay, thank you very much. CAGAPTAY: My pleasure. Thank you.

At this moment, there are competing claims for who is in control of the country. Earlier this evening, the military took control of a state television station. An announcer read a statement that said, the armed forces were running the country. Not long after that, the president spoke to network television in the country. The news anchor at the desk held a cellphone while Recep Tayyip Erdogan spoke on the small screen of the phone. He vowed to retaliate against the military and said, the people behind the uprising would be punished. NPR's diplomatic correspondent Michele Kelemen has been following the U. S. response to this and is here in the studio with us. Hi, Michele. MICHELE KELEMEN, BYLINE: Hi, Ari. KELEMEN: What kind of reaction have we heard so far? KELEMEN: So far, mainly a lot of watching with concern. President Obama, we're being told, is being briefed and regularly updated on this. We heard from Secretary of State John Kerry, who is in Moscow. He said, he hopes for stability, peace and continuity. But he didn't have much to say. He had been spending the whole day cloistered away in talks with his Russian counterpart about Syria. We're also hearing words of concern from many other places, from the United Nations and from U. K. and mainly appeals for calm. SHAPIRO: Partially because this just seems so unstable right now. It seems that nobody really knows what is going on. What advice is the State Department offering to Americans living in Turkey? KELEMEN: To shelter in place and to update their friends and family as possible to let them know that they're safe. The embassy is warning Americans that major bridges in Istanbul have been closed, that some buildings are under blockade. And while the U. S. is telling people to stay indoors, Ari, President Erdogan has been calling on his supporters to get out in the streets to protest. SHAPIRO: Turkey is such an important U. S. ally, particularly in the context of NATO. How does this complicate American policy? KELEMEN: It is a key ally. The U. S. worked very closely with Turkey, particularly now in the fight against ISIS. The U. S. uses the Incirlik Air Base, for instance, which is in Turkey. We're told some of those flights are on hold now as everyone tries to figure out what's happening. So there is a lot at stake. But while the military ties have been close, the U. S. and Turkey do have a lot of differences, particularly between Presidents Obama and Erdogan. They've had some tense clashes over, for instance, U. S. concern about human rights in Turkey and a crackdown on media. And they have differences over Syria policy. President Erdogan has been complaining about U. S. support for Kurdish fighters in Syria, so there is a lot of tension. But obviously, no one wants to see any kind of protect - protracted conflict in Turkey over this. SHAPIRO: Turkey has had coups in the past. But why would the military now try to overthrow the Erdogan government? KELEMEN: Erdogan has been consolidating power, cracking down on the media. So there are a lot of domestic things going on. There's also a lot of concern internationally. I mean, he - there was a recent ISIS bombing at the Istanbul airport. He came under a lot of fire, a lot of criticism for not doing enough to protect people. His government also has a lot of conflicts with regional neighbors, with many other governments. And it's so fascinating, Ari, because it's a government that came to power talking about a - no-problem-with-neighbors policy. And they seem to be in a fight with just about everybody now.

SHAPIRO: Have you heard any of the gunfire or explosions that we are seeing reports about? AYDINTASBAS: We've heard a bit of gunfire. I live on the Bosphorus in Istanbul. And we've also heard fighter jets flying across about an hour ago - several rounds, actually. There are reports of people. Erdogan was just on television. He has gone on one of the networks via a cell phone, actually, and he called on his supporters to get on the streets. SHAPIRO: And are people doing that? AYDINTASBAS: Well, it's hard to say. I mean, some people are, and - but it's hard to say how many. I - I haven't seen really too many people in terms of the footage. Some networks particularly close to Erdogan are showing people on the streets, but not - we're not talking about thousands of people. So it's hard to say. I think we heard a communique from a group, a military council which is called Peace at Home Council, and they said the Turkish - Turkish Armed Forces has taken over. And they said it was for democracy and human rights and because the constitutional order had been put on hold. SHAPIRO: And so, if I understand this correctly, it sounds like the military and the government are each claiming to be in charge and each urging people to come to their support. Is that what's happening? AYDINTASBAS: No. The military has said we have taken over. The government has come out and said - both Erdogan and other ministers that are on the air are saying it's a minority group within the military, it's not sanctioned by the chain of command and that people should resist. So the military statement said, have taken over. It's to impose democracy and human rights and because the Constitution has been put on hold. And they said we're going to impose a curfew, et cetera. And then, shortly thereafter, we heard from the government people and Erdogan himself saying this is a minority within the military and that people should get out on the streets and resist and also that they should get to the airport and to city centers. Erdogan is - I think had been on vacation, so he still is not in Ankara or Istanbul, where he has residences. And we do not know his location. But it's clear that the government is going to try to use the police force to counter the sort of effort to take over. What we do not know is what branches of the military are involved, whether or not this is the military - you know, Turkish armed forces en masse or certain groups within the military.

A statement being read by an announcer cites rising autocratic rule and increased terrorism. At the same time, the country's leadership has only gone so far as to say that there is an uprising in the military. To help us sort out what is happening, we are joined by Henri Barkey. He's the director of the Middle East program at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, and he joins us from Istanbul. Welcome to the program. HENRI BARKEY: Thank you. SHAPIRO: What is your sense of what is happening right now in Turkey? BARKEY: Look, I think it's too early to tell. I think we have to wait and see what's going on. If it was a real serious coup attempt, I don't think it was very well-planned because clearly the prime minister spoke on television, and the president also is out there urging people to go out in the streets. So this - if this was a real - real serious coup attempt, I would have expected those two - those two gentlemen to have been arrested immediately. So we don't know. I mean, it may - it may be a coup in the making, in the sense that it started off small or medium-sized and maybe other units will join. Or it may be that it is only a coup that will be overwhelmed by the rest of the - of the military. I don't think we know enough, but something certainly is going on. And this is going to have very serious repercussions for Turkish policy, Turkish domestic security, Turkish stability and whether or not Erdogan and the prime minister remain or whether or not they topple. I think we've got to deal with a very, very different Turkey either way. SHAPIRO: It does seem like very contradictory messages, where the military - or at least facets of the military - say we are in control, and the president and prime minister say this was an attempted coup within the military, and we're still doing fine, and we are in control. BARKEY: Right. I mean, look, I think it's - I think it's very clear that whatever this is, it's not a full blown coup that originates with a high command. It is clearly within the military - a faction of the military. So it - it must - we don't know the size of that faction. If that faction is very, very strong, it will maybe overwhelm the rest of the military. If it's not, it's going to succumb. So that's - that's what we don't know at the - at the moment. And that's why you have confusing stories out there. Initially, I thought that this was a very small attempt, but clearly it has legs, and it is most serious than I personally thought it was. But at the moment, because of the confusion, we will not know for - for a while. And what we're seeing is. . . SHAPIRO: Can you briefly - can you briefly explain what would have motivated elements of the military or the military in its entirety to rebel against the country's leadership? BARKEY: Look, the military has been unhappy with Erdogan for a while. Now that's he's president and with his authoritarian style, it's not that the military is essentially a democratic force. It is not. But until very recently, the president and - had a very strong ally against the military. He and his ally, - this organization called (unintelligible) - they broke. So the - the president has tried to align himself with the military, and I think the military is smelling weakness. SHAPIRO: All right, we're going to have to leave it there.

Welcome to the program. AYLA JEAN YACKLEY: Hi, thanks for having me. SHAPIRO: What is the latest that we've heard from the country's leadership? YACKLEY: The last message that we got was from the military, in which they issued a statement on their website, as well as an email saying that they had taken control of power, that they were now in charge. After that, we had a report from the state's news agency that members of the senior military leadership were being held at the General Staff - held against their will at the General Staff headquarters in Ankara. So prior to that statement, we had the prime minister go live on a private news channel and say that there had been an attempt at a coup, but he stopped short of saying that it was - that it had succeeded. So we have - there is some confusion at this moment about who exactly is in charge. SHAPIRO: There have been so many reports in the last six months about Turkey's military gaining power and strains with the civilian leadership. What is leading up to this upheaval? YACKLEY: For a year now, Turkey has been - the Turkish military has been actively engaged in conflict with the Kurdistan Workers' Party, an outlawed armed Kurdish autonomy-seeking group. That has really changed the dynamic here in Turkey. The military is a much more present force, just by virtue of the fact that it's battling this armed insurgency. And that has really pushed them to the forefront. But we haven't actually seen much in the way of open conflict or tension between the government and the military to date. I think that most people in Turkey are extremely surprised by what's happening tonight. SHAPIRO: Do we have any idea whether this apparent uprising within the military is a few low-level people or senior leadership?

That would suggest that no, it's not the leadership, which in fact seems to have, from everything that we can discern, has had good relations with the civilian government to date.

MARTIN: So do you or does your news organization feel it has a handle on who is behind this? FOUKARA: No, we don't. There's obviously a lot of uncertainty. There has been some expectation that trouble was brewing for some time, especially that he, Erdogan, has been talking about a possible coup for well over a year now. But he's always accused - well, for some time he's been accusing a former partner of his who is now living in exile here in the United States, Fethullah Gulen, of trying to foment trouble back in Turkey. And he accuses Gulen here in the United States of being at the top of it. MARTIN: Who is Fethullah Gulen? And can you walk us through the political tensions or the tensions between him and the president? FOUKARA: Fethullah Gulen is somebody who had partnered with Erdogan to sort of counter in Turkey the leftists and the Kemalists and the liberals - had been very critical of Erdogan, saying that he wants to reestablish the caliphate. However, a few years ago, they parted company. They disagreed on the strategy. So Gulen is much more than just a religious leader. He's also a businessman. He runs schools, religious schools, even here in the United States. And Erdogan has been pressing the Obama administration to extradite him back to Turkey. But the Obama administration has been saying, look, this is a Turkish domestic row, and the United States has no place in it. What we've heard from Kerry seems to suggest that issue will be strongly revisited now that Erdogan has yet again accused Gulen of being behind the attempted coup. MARTIN: What have been Gulen's role in the view of Erdogan? FOUKARA: Well, his influence is quite tentacular (ph). He has followers inside Turkey, not just among the population. He has followers in the army and the police, in the legal corps inside Turkey. Whether he is actually behind the coup, we don't know. He has actually - Gulen has condemned the attempted coup after it happened. MARTIN: What has been the reaction in Turkey to the moves that Erdogan has taken in response to this attempted coup? FOUKARA: There's been a wave of arrests touching various places of political power and military power and legal power in Turkey. But it's quite clear that obviously even Erdogan's critics did rally to his call to actually take to the streets to prevent the coup from succeeding. What the next step is going to be, we still don't know. The speaker of the parliament has said that the coup will bring everybody closer together - easier said than actually done in the current climate. It's very difficult to actually see what the next - even the next week will bring to the political climate in Turkey. MARTIN: What do you believe this coup - or attempted coup, rather - indicates about the state of Turkish governance right now? FOUKARA: The image that it has projected to the outside world is that Erdogan's position is actually - is much more tenuous than we have been led to believe over the last few years. Now he has a divided army. Will he be able now to confront all these external challenges with a fractured army in addition to - once the wave of support has worn out - will he be able to carry the day?

And also people driving through the streets honking horns, saying that they saved the country's democracy. They saved the country, and they're out to show solidarity and celebrate the country, but away from those scenes of festivities, a sense of sadness and great tension. I spoke to one man who told me, our soldiers are really honest and really good. I don't trust our president. And he seemed really genuinely afraid of what will happen next. MARTIN: To that end, the president Erdogan has vowed to punish those responsible. Has he taken any steps to do that so far? What's he done? FADEL: So far, we've seen thousands of troops detained in bases around the country, including some top-ranking commanders, two top-ranking ground commanders, nearly 3,000 judges who were suspended because they're linked to what Erdogan says are the people who plotted the coup against him. He's also calling for the extradition of a Turkish cleric who is in Pennsylvania who he says is behind the plan to overthrow him. MARTIN: So those are some sweeping moves. Have you been able to discern how people feel about that? How are they responding to the steps that he's taken so far? FADEL: Well, what I've found so far is a country that's divided. Erdogan came into power with the slim majority. He's ruled, but his opponents are worried about the amassing of his power. His critics say that year after year, he goes after his opponents in a more harsh way, going after journalists, labeling his opponents terrorists, assassins. And so those who don't support him worry that this attempted coup is a pretext for him to have an even bigger crackdown. So there is a lot of concern. There is also a lot of true celebration and happiness that this democracy was saved, that this was a victory. And so what - you're seeing both of these things. So you're seeing a divided society and a divided military. And one thing I also noticed is that a lot of people who are not in the square celebrating that we spoke to had some hope that maybe this coup would actually work. They wanted it. Some people - we have to acknowledge that. And there was a sadness when they saw soldiers surrendering on TV. Turks have a lot of pride in their army. MARTIN: That's NPR's Leila Fadel in Istanbul.

SCOTT SIMON, BYLINE: As what President Francois Hollande has described as this unspeakable act was probably underway in Nice, my family and I are enjoying the same kind of Bastille Day festivities in Deauville, Normandy. (SOUNDBITE OF FIREWORKS EXPLODING)SIMON: Fireworks along the beach were spectacular, streaking the sky with stripes of red and blue and starbursts of bright white light. Bastille Day is France's national holiday. It's just not the birth of the French Republic, but the start of summer, with long family meals and late night strolls which the French believe in as a constitutional right. Every big town and small village in France has these ceremonies. Many of the people in our town had gathered in the town square. A British regimental band, Brexit be damned, played oom-pah-pah (ph) music while people lit candles and paper lanterns as the sky darkened and the gaggle of happy families and fired-up teenagers set out to march through the town to the beach. But in these times, after so many acts of terror, no public gathering in France, from the Euro Cup tournament to a beach town parade, can be carefree. We've seen terror and bloodshed strike in a moment. You don't want to be silly, but you also don't want to be stupid, especially when you hold on to the hand of a child. But you also don't want anxieties to make you scared to do what you cherish, so we walked through town. We looked up at people who looked on from their balconies, including a man in a bathrobe, and sometimes waved and also saw French security forces on roofs. They don't wave. When we got to the beach the fireworks began. At one point a couple of sullen, unsmiling kids began to push their way through the crowd just in front of us. My wife and I confessed later that we'd each thought of the brothers who bombed the Boston Marathon. The fireworks show was glorious, but we were glad to hear the last pop from the sky and see the last glowing ash drift down. As the crowd began to walk back over the promenade that runs along the beach here in Deauville, you could hear beeps and trills from cell phones, alerts from the BBC or Le Monde about the truck attack along the promenade in Nice. It is probably impossible for anyone in France not to feel that it could have been their town, their family, their friends, which I suppose is the whole point of terror. A parent has to weigh the risk that something terrible could happen against the risk of raising children in fear. LINDA WERTHEIMER, HOST:  Scott Simon has been in France with his family during this week of the attack in Nice, and he sends us these thoughts. SCOTT SIMON, BYLINE: As what President Francois Hollande has described as this unspeakable act was probably underway in Nice, my family and I are enjoying the same kind of Bastille Day festivities in Deauville, Normandy. (SOUNDBITE OF FIREWORKS EXPLODING) SIMON: Fireworks along the beach were spectacular, streaking the sky with stripes of red and blue and starbursts of bright white light. Bastille Day is France's national holiday. It's just not the birth of the French Republic, but the start of summer, with long family meals and late night strolls which the French believe in as a constitutional right. Every big town and small village in France has these ceremonies. Many of the people in our town had gathered in the town square. A British regimental band, Brexit be damned, played oom-pah-pah (ph) music while people lit candles and paper lanterns as the sky darkened and the gaggle of happy families and fired-up teenagers set out to march through the town to the beach. But in these times, after so many acts of terror, no public gathering in France, from the Euro Cup tournament to a beach town parade, can be carefree. We've seen terror and bloodshed strike in a moment. You don't want to be silly, but you also don't want to be stupid, especially when you hold on to the hand of a child. But you also don't want anxieties to make you scared to do what you cherish, so we walked through town. We looked up at people who looked on from their balconies, including a man in a bathrobe, and sometimes waved and also saw French security forces on roofs. They don't wave. When we got to the beach the fireworks began. At one point a couple of sullen, unsmiling kids began to push their way through the crowd just in front of us. My wife and I confessed later that we'd each thought of the brothers who bombed the Boston Marathon. The fireworks show was glorious, but we were glad to hear the last pop from the sky and see the last glowing ash drift down. As the crowd began to walk back over the promenade that runs along the beach here in Deauville, you could hear beeps and trills from cell phones, alerts from the BBC or Le Monde about the truck attack along the promenade in Nice. It is probably impossible for anyone in France not to feel that it could have been their town, their family, their friends, which I suppose is the whole point of terror.

One place of concern is a tiny outcrop called the Scarborough Shoal which China seized from the Philippines in 2012. As Michael Sullivan reports from Manila, it's a big deal. MICHAEL SULLIVAN, BYLINE: Here's the thing. The Scarborough Shoal - it's just a bunch of rocks and coral in the middle of the ocean, a place the U. S. used to use for target practice back in the day when Clark Air Base and Subic Bay Naval Station near Manila were the biggest U. S. bases in Asia. But it's real close to the coast of the Philippines - just 110 nautical miles. ANTONIO CARPIO: Strategically, China did not seize Scarborough Shoal in 2012 just to seize it. It was always for a purpose. Every reef that they seized in the Spratlys, they have created an island. SULLIVAN: And a Chinese presence on Scarborough Shoal, Philippine Supreme Court Associate Justice Antonio Carpio says, will be no different. CARPIO: If you have an airfield there, maybe it will take just 15 minutes for the fighter jets there to reach Manila, and the U. S. forces, using Clark and Subic - they are all within range. SULLIVAN: Which helps explain why the U. S. military has been so visible in the contested waters and in the air the past few months - two aircraft carrier groups on joint patrol in the Philippine Sea and U. S. warplanes flying near Scarborough Shoal, making it clear the U. S. considers reclamation of and construction on Scarborough a red line China shouldn't cross. And the international court's smackdown of China, analysts here say, doesn't help Beijing's cause. JAY BATONGBACAL: Even their strategists would know, I think, the Scarborough Shoal will be a tipping point for the U. S. and Japan. SULLIVAN: Jay Batongbacal heads the Institute for Maritime Affairs and Law of the Sea at the University of the Philippines. BATONGBACAL: Because it would complete the so-called strategic triangle that could finally establish full control over the South China Sea. And they would know that the U. S. and Japan will not allow that to happen easily. SULLIVAN: But how red is that red line? Richard Heydarian teaches at De La Salle University in Manila. He's the author of \"Asia's New Battlefield: The U. S. , China And The Struggle for the Western Pacific. \"RICHARD HEYDARIAN: We already heard this red line statement on Syria, and we clearly saw how it was not a red line after all. So the fear of a lot of Filipinos, I think surely President Duterte, is that we have the same artificial posturing red line here when it comes to Scarborough Shoal that doesn't mean anything in operational terms. SULLIVAN: And that mistrust, he says, helps explain why the Philippines new president, Rodrigo Duterte, is taking a softly, softly approach with China. HEYDARIAN: The Philippines not flaunting and taunting the verdict. In exchange for that, China will give guarantees that in the short run, at least, it will not up the ante. It will not establish facilities in the Scarborough Shoal, and it will actually perhaps give the Filipino fishermen more leeway to gain access to that area. SULLIVAN: Both the Philippines and China have been cautious in their response to the court's verdict, and there's an expectation here that this restrained approach will last for a few months, anyway. But Justice Carpio remains convinced China will go ahead with reclamation and construction on Scarborough Shoal. CARPIO: That's my personal assessment, yes. SULLIVAN: And the question then, Carpio says, is if the U. S. red line bleeds. CARPIO: Whether it will turn yellow or pink or purple. But they will lose a lot of credibility if they say there's a red line and the red line just disappears. SULLIVAN: Not just in the Philippines, Carpio says, but in Japan, Vietnam and other countries engaged in maritime disputes with China, too. For NPR News, I'm Michael Sullivan in Manila.

The World Anti-Doping Agency asked a Canadian law professor to conduct the inquiry. It could lead to the entire Russian team being excluded from next month's Rio Olympics. Professor Richard McLaren talked about his report at a press conference in Toronto this morning. And NPR's Corey Flintoff has been listening from his post in Moscow. Welcome to the program. COREY FLINTOFF, BYLINE: Good morning, Renee. MONTAGNE: Hi. Good morning. These allegations first surfaced in The New York Times a few months ago. Did McLaren confirm any of those reports? FLINTOFF: Well, he did. As you said, the most explosive allegation here was that the Russian government was basically in charge of a sports doping system. It was state-sponsored. It was overseen by the Russian minister of sports and with the participation of the Russian security services. McLaren said he confirmed all that beyond a regional - reasonable doubt. And, you know, that's absolutely key. This wasn't just a few athletes and coaches who cheated. It was the Russian government. He also found that Russia's main doping lab in Moscow operated a system for doping athletes and a system to cover up positive samples by some of them. He found that the lab in Sochi - you know, during the Winter Olympics two years ago - actually had a scheme to protect doping athletes by swapping out their samples. I mean, if they tested positive for drugs, their samples would be swapped for clean ones. And he said he confirmed that there was a very sophisticated system for tampering with so-called tamper-proof sample bottles. So the Sochi allegations basically mean that this cheating extended way beyond Russia's track and field athletes. MONTAGNE: Well, so the Russian government has already, you know, sort of poo-pooed the original New York Times reports. But have the athletes and the government got a chance to react to this, and what does it all mean? FLINTOFF: So far, they just seem to be basically absorbing this latest news. You know - but before this came out, a lot of Russian athletes said, they think it's unfair to punish clean athletes for the actions of a few cheaters. Russia's state-owned sports TV channel actually is planning to air a - sort of a mini documentary that claims that Russian athletes were unfairly smeared and that it's all about politics. It's all anti-Russian. And I think that'll pretty much reflect what Russian officials have to say about this. MONTAGNE: So now the fate of the Russian athletes goes before - becomes whatever the International Olympic Committee says. FLINTOFF: Well, there's some other hurdles that have to be gone over. Some of these athletes - more than 60 of them have appealed their cases to the Court of Arbitration for Sports, so that'll be more input for the IOC, basically. The individual federations for the various sports have to weigh in as well. MONTAGNE: OK. FLINTOFF: And some of them have said, that they don't believe in a blanket - blanket. . . MONTAGNE: All right - OK, good, great. NPR's Corey Flintoff, he's been listening from Moscow to a press conference about the Russian involvement with drugs. Thanks. FLINTOFF: Thanks, Renee.

He's a professor at Loyola University who has written a book about Gulen. Welcome to the show. JOSHUA HENDRICK: Thank you. MCEVERS: This is a man who hasn't lived in Turkey for a long time. He lives in a small town in Pennsylvania. What does that tell us about how big and pervasive his following is inside Turkey? HENDRICK: It's a little bit of a challenge to give a specific number. There's no card-carrying identification that says, I'm a member of the Gulen movement. Estimates range from a quarter million to 4 million adherents in Turkey and around the world. MCEVERS: And so how would you describe him? He's called a cleric. He's called the head of a charity. Who is he? HENDRICK: Fethullah Gulen is a religious community leader. While working as a religious teacher in the early part of his career in the 1960s, he developed a following of primarily young men. His teachings offered a focus on modern sciences, on professional economic pursuits that were argued by him to be completely parallel and harmonious with the teachings of Islam. MCEVERS: Fethullah Gulen and Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan at one time were allies. How did that happen, and then how did they eventually come to differ? HENDRICK: They are two different brands of Islamic political identity in Turkey that share far more in common in their worldview than they do not. Where they united, more specifically domestically, has to do with removing the military's capacity to act as an oversight force over Turkish government. When that obstacle was perceived by both to have been handled, they then turned on each other, and it's been proven over the past two years that the AKP is far more powerful and has effectively purged members of the Gulen movement from a variety of institutions to the last stronghold of Gulens within the Turkish state - was in the Turkish judiciary and then in segments of the military, which then. . . MCEVERS: Right. HENDRICK: . . . Leads to the allegations that he was behind the coup. MCEVERS: So if you look at the purges now - such high numbers of people being purged from the ranks. What does this mean? I mean the government is saying these are terrorists; these are people who attempted to take our lives. What is your sense of this? HENDRICK: I have no problem intellectually seeing how the Gulens could be pointed to as the perpetrators of this event. I also, however, knowing Turkey can see how that is a very neat and tidy scapegoat that does provide rationale for a cleansing and a purging of a variety of state institutions that so far have made things somewhat difficult for Erdogan to realize his full goals. MCEVERS: How do you think these purges inside Turkey will affect Gulen's movement? HENDRICK: If this coup was perpetrated by the Gulen movement, which there's certainly enough circumstantial things to point at that would lend credence to that, it was so ill-conceived and is so antithetical to their collective identity that I view it as being cataclysmic to not only their activities in Turkey but around the world. Their whole collective identity has to do with advocacy for interfaith dialogue, for conflict resolution, for democracy. This event flies in the face of all three of those things, and thus it really would prove what many of the Gulen movement's critics have been saying for some of which over 40 years that they are wolf in sheep's clothing, a Trojan horse waiting patiently until their time to strike. MCEVERS: Turkish state media says Turkey has now sent a formal request to the United States to extradite Gulen. Will this happen, do you think, and does this put the U. S. in a difficult position? HENDRICK: Absolutely puts the U. S. in a difficult position. Will it happen? There's been lip service to that for years. The burden of proof will be on the Turkish state to provide the evidence required for extradition for somebody who holds a permanent residency in the United States, which Fethullah Gulen has since November of 2008.

The government today imposed a three-month state of emergency that will intensify the crackdown on dissent that's been happening since an attempted coup over the weekend. We're going to check in now with NPR's Peter Kenyon in Istanbul. Hi, there, Peter. PETER KENYON, BYLINE: Hi, Kelly. MCEVERS: So, first, what is the government saying about this state of emergency? Why are they imposing It? KENYON: Well, we're just getting the broad outlines at the moment. It gives broad powers to security forces and the government. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan says it's necessary to protect the rule of law and democracy. But he also made clear these would be used as extensively against the Pennsylvania-based cleric Fethullah Gulen. That's a former ally now accused of fomenting this failed coup. Erdogan basically said it will make everything more efficient - easier to round up people, try them, question them. There's about 10,000 accused of backing the coup and another 50,000 or more accused of supporting Gulen. So this will also allow more laws to be passed, so there could be new powers in the future that we don't know about yet. Constitution says this could last six months, which means this could be extended for another three if Erdogan wants to. MCEVERS: Well, let's talk more a little bit about that rounding up of people. Is that still ongoing? And what is it looking like these days? KENYON: Still ongoing and continuing. Erdogan told Al Jazeera English there were 9,004 people detained and nearly 20,000 arrested - that means charged by a court. And he said the interrogations are yielding more and more names, so we can expect this to continue. And on the street, there's basically a lot of very worried Turks - anyone with views not aligned with keeping Erdogan a very low profile. But there's also a large segment of the population that's kind of proud they faced down a coup. There's been several in the past. There was a big crowd at Taksim Square in Istanbul tonight. They fell very quiet as the speech began - stayed quiet - but at the end there was a round of applause. It's a deeply divided population. They're clinging at the moment to the one thing they hope they all share - a deep loathing of military governments. MCEVERS: That's NPR's Peter Kenyon in Istanbul. Thanks a lot.

And he said the interrogations are yielding more and more names, so we can expect this to continue. And on the street, there's basically a lot of very worried Turks - anyone with views not aligned with keeping Erdogan a very low profile. But there's also a large segment of the population that's kind of proud they faced down a coup. There's been several in the past. There was a big crowd at Taksim Square in Istanbul tonight. They fell very quiet as the speech began - stayed quiet - but at the end there was a round of applause. It's a deeply divided population. They're clinging at the moment to the one thing they hope they all share - a deep loathing of military governments. MCEVERS: That's NPR's Peter Kenyon in Istanbul. Thanks a lot.

That group has lost territory across Syria and Iraq, even as ISIS, or ISIL as it's also known, continues to claim devastating attacks. This morning in Washington, U. S. Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter is meeting with defense ministers from the coalition of nations against the Islamic State. That gathering comes at a turbulent time. A key member Turkey is reeling from an attempted coup, and its president is blaming followers of an Islamic cleric now in exile in the U. S. When I sat down with Secretary Carter at the Pentagon yesterday, I asked him what the turmoil in Turkey might mean for the fight against ISIS. ASHTON CARTER: Well, we didn't know this was coming. But I don't think it's going to affect our campaign against ISIL. And in fact, I spoke to my Turkish counterpart earlier today, and he told me as much. As far as we know, the entire military wasn't involved. This was a faction or a group within the military. And the Turkish military is very large, very professional organization. They're a NATO ally. We've worked with them for decades, and I expect our relationship there to continue. MONTAGNE: And does - and your counterpart, is there anything you can tell us about what he said? CARTER: Yes. No, he simply said that they had gained control of events there. He was very pleased to hear from me. He and I have a good relationship. And I told him I was very glad to hear of his safety. MONTAGNE: Well, talk about attacks in other parts of the world. Obviously, Western Europe - we've seen some terrible attacks in France, in Brussels. How much of this is being directed out of Raqqa? You talk about defeating ISIS. You've got to talk about some - a real place. It's Raqqa, Syria, and also the city of Mosul. CARTER: Raqqa in Syria and Mosul in Iraq are our two primary objectives because they're large cities. And in the case of Raqqa, this is the self-proclaimed capital of the self-proclaimed caliphate. And. . . MONTAGNE: So what's the plan? CARTER: Well, the plan will be to take Raqqa away from them and make sure that there aren't - isn't any ISIL planning done there. It's important to show that there cannot be and will not be an Islamic State based upon this ideology. In answer to your question about inspiration or direction, you see both. Sometimes you see direction of attacks in other countries coming out of Raqqa or Mosul. Sometimes it's just the inspiration. It's just the idea that there's this thing called this Islamic State. But either way, it's important that we destroy the fact of and the idea of an Islamic State. MONTAGNE: Secretary of State John Kerry is working with the Russians to help coordinate air strikes in Syria against ISIS and a Syrian al-Qaida affiliate as well, the Nusra Front. Russia came into the conflict on the side of the Assad regime. If the Pentagon coordinates airstrikes with the Russians, would this not help Bashar al-Assad stay in power? CARTER: Well, that's not in the cards at the moment. What we're discussing with the Russians is the possibility - which still only remains a possibility - that they will begin to do, in fact, what they said they were going to do when they first intervened in Syria. What they said they were going to do was promote a transition away from Assad and therefore toward the end of the civil war, which started this whole thing. And then they said they were going to fight the terrorists, but that's not what they've done. They've instead propped up Assad in fighting the moderate opposition. MONTAGNE: Pulling Russia away from attacking Western-backed rebels, when it chooses to do that, and getting it focused on ISIL - will there potentially be a partnership at that very moment in time? There's the same. CARTER: No, well, we'd always - we have our differences with Russia. And obviously, Syria is one. Ukraine is another. At the same time, we stand ready to work with Russia, as with others around the world, where our interests coincide and overlap. So, for example, the Russians worked with us on the Iranian nuclear deal. They've worked on us in some aspects of nonproliferation affecting North Korea. So there are areas where we found it's possible. But up to now in Syria - and we'll see about the future - they have been more intent on operating in ways that are not consistent with our interests than in ways consistent with our interest. So we'll see what the future holds. MONTAGNE: Defense Secretary Ashton Carter. We went on to talk about Afghanistan. The U. N. estimates the Taliban holds more ground in Afghanistan now than since the U. S. -led invasion in 2001. President Obama aimed, from day one, to leave office with no American troops in Afghanistan. He thought it was the good war. He said we could do good things there, but they - we're going to be out. Several dates came and went. And now, he has agreed to leave 8,500 troops through 2017. For most people - most Americans haven't thought of the war that much. What can that mean? How valuable can that be? CARTER: Well, it is a much smaller number than used to be there. And that is because our role there now is to assist the Afghan security forces. Remember, there were no - was no Afghan army. There was no Afghan air force. There was nothing. We laboriously built up the Afghan security forces. And  they're capable of fighting largely on their own - but not entirely on their own. So we're helping them. So that's what the American presence there is for. And you're right, the president has constantly assessed and adjusted what we're doing there in consideration of the conditions. So if you like, he took out a little extra insurance policy on the success of the Afghan security forces and, therefore, asked us to make some adjustments. But in the military sense it's mostly in the hands of the Afghan security forces now. And as you know from years - of the past, they are, today, a capable force. They were nothing a few years ago. MONTAGNE: Likely to see thousands of American troops there for some years to come? CARTER: Oh, I think probably future presidents will continue to adjust that. And I think as the Afghan security forces get stronger and the Taliban and other forces get weaker or more dispirited, that not just the U. S. , but the other international presence there can go down. I think we'll always want to keep a close eye on counterterrorism in South Asia. That'll probably be an enduring interest of the United States for quite some time. MONTAGNE: That was Defense Secretary Ashton Carter who was hosting defense ministers from nations in the counter-Islamic State coalition today in Washington. RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST:  When the conventions are over and a new president takes office, one of the biggest challenges will be the Islamic State.

It has suspended over 15,000 education workers, ordered the resignation of university deans across the country and imposed a temporary travel ban on academics. Those who are overseas on assignment are being asked to report to the government and might be sent home. Sinan Ciddi is executive director of the Institute for Turkish Studies at Georgetown University. He taught in Turkey for four years, from 2004 to 2008. He says his colleagues there now are afraid for their lives, and I asked him why the government is targeting academics. SINAN CIDDI: I mean, this wouldn't be the first time. I mean, in past coups, particularly following 1980 coup, the military order at that time also made an example of going after a considerable number of scholars and defanging the critical sort of perspective of academia. MCEVERS: Right. CIDDI: And it's also no secret from the perspective of Erdogan that he's had a rough ride with academics who don't necessarily see eye-to-eye with his world view. Erdogan doesn't like the fact that academia and scholars and critical opinion basically tries to fine tune what should be Turkey's democratic credentials for the future. And ever since the mid-2000s, the tone of Erdogan against scholars has increasingly become more and more vitriolic. MCEVERS: Right, I was going to say - and that would have a chilling effect on those academics who remain. CIDDI: It does, and it's very chilling. And it's also - they would have to define what their role would be. I mean, now that, you know, new deans are likely to be appointed, possibly new university presidents, they might come down with very severe directives on what they can write, what conferences they can participate at. Are they going to be feared of being listened to or reported on if they take a critical tone? We've had a lot of defiant, a lot of brave scholars in the past who did what they were supposed to do, which was critically analyze what their expertise is and how that relates to Turkey. MCEVERS: Yeah. CIDDI: I just feel at this stage more might be coming down in the way of these sort of punitive measures, which may endanger their livelihood. MCEVERS: Turkey's government has blamed this failed coup on followers of a cleric named Fethullah Gulen. He's based here in the United States and has set up a network of schools inside Turkey. Are many Turkish academics followers of Gulen? CIDDI: I'm sure there are certain universities in Turkey that are explicitly sort of Gulenish and that affiliate with the cleric, but also a considerable number of universities I don't think have anything to do with the movement. It's very hard to say, you know, who's who and who's what. But again, I mean, just the mere fact that these individuals might be sympathetic to or affiliated with Gulen movement does not make them criminals. This is why we fear that the wide net that's been cast to go after people is possibly a witch-hunt. MCEVERS: How do you think this will all play out? I mean, what's the end game here for academics? I know you talked about people just being worried about where this is going to go. What's your sense? CIDDI: It's hard. I mean, right now it's so fluid and so developing on a daily basis. My ultimate sense is this is not going to bode well, end well for the academy. It's not going to end well for journalism. It's not going to end well, I think, for a lot of voices who are not necessarily opponents of Erdogan, but, oh, you know, would like to live in a society that is broadly critical and analytic. I think right now Erdogan's in such a position that he is basically unparalleled and unrivaled in his ability to basically be able to eradicate, if not most, then maybe even all of it just by intimidation and fear. MCEVERS: Sinan Ciddi is executive director of the Institute for Turkish Studies at Georgetown University. Thanks for your time today. CIDDI: Thank you very much.

Hundreds of people around the world have died in attacks by the Islamic State, and one of the worst happened earlier this month in Baghdad where a suicide bomber killed more than 250 people. One of the victims was a young man named Adil Al-Faj (ph). He was known online as Adel Euro, a hip-hop dancer. And NPR's Denise Guerra has his story. DENISE GUERRA, BYLINE: Adel Euro desperately wanted out of Iraq, and he had a plan. Adel wanted to dance in New York. He heard that Jonathan Hollander, the founder of Battery Dance Company there, had gone to Iraq to work with professional dancers. Adel never went to school for dancing. He learned how to dance from YouTube, mainly breakdancing tutorials and old Michael Jackson videos. He needed to get Jonathan's attention, so Adel made his own video and sent it to him. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)GUERRA: The video shows a wide gray pavement, a grove of trees covering cars zooming by. There's an artist, but Jonathan can't see what he's painting. Adel enters and starts dancing. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)GUERRA: Straight break dancing, pop and lock poses - then, Jonathan sees what's in the painting. JONATHAN HOLLANDER: Painter is finished the portrait and it's my picture. It was like an electrical shock had gone through my body. I couldn't believe it. Tears came into my eyes. GUERRA: It definitely got Jonathan's attention. He and Adel began talking through Facebook, text messages, and Skype. They got so close that Adel started calling him his other dad. Here's one of Adel's messages to Jonathan. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)ADIL AL-FAJ: Surprise. Hey, Dad, how are you? I - at training today in my home with exercise and the contemporary. So thank you so much, Dad, and take care. HOLLANDER: Adel had a limber body. He could do a split in any direction. He had everything in place. So it was just a question of teaching him the technique. GUERRA: But how could you teach someone in Baghdad from Manhattan? (SOUNBITE OF SKYPE RINGING)GUERRA: Skype. Jonathan asked Sean Scantlebury, one of his top students, to teach Adel. They practiced almost every day for six months. Sometimes the video connection was so bad they'd skip the dance lesson altogether. And Sean said they would just talk. SEAN SCANTLEBURY: And he told me a story about practicing in a park. I think he was trying to make a film. And the cops came by and stopped him and asked him, like, what are you doing? And quickly, he said, oh, I'm practicing martial arts. BILAL: In my country, if people saw you dance, they say you are gay. GUERRA: That's Adel's younger brother, Bilal (ph). He lives in Belgium as a refugee. He's also a dancer. BILAL: If they see him, you know they will threat him or they will kill him. It's just the way Iraq is. GUERRA: Still, Adel put everything he did on YouTube and gained a small following. In his videos, he expressed his frustrations about still being in Iraq. (SOUNDBITE OF YOUTUBE VIDEO)AL-FAJ: I'm just a person who has this talent. But no one cares about me. And no one cares about this talent. With all these reasons, I will never give up. GUERRA: Adel's message gave his brother Bilal, his fans and his friends hope. BILAL: He give me more motivation to do more and more. Like, he was my best example. When I see him, I want to be better. GUERRA: Adel went on to finish law school and propose to his girlfriend. Last year, he even performed at the Amman Contemporary Dance Festival in Jordan where he met Sean and Jonathan in person. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)GUERRA: He danced to this song. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)GUERRA: Earlier this month, Adel went back to Baghdad. He was watching the Euro Cup with his friends at a busy shopping mall. It was the end of Ramadan. And the mood was festive, until an ISIS suicide blast killed almost 300 people. Adel was one of them. His mentor Jonathan Hollander received an anonymous Facebook message about Adel's death. He told the sender not to tell him the details. HOLLANDER: I loved Adel like a son. Please don't send me the pictures, I can't see them. I want to remember him as the beautiful, happy young man whom I knew. GUERRA: Adel's friends and family continue to mourn him on social media. They say the older generation knows him as a lawyer and a loving son. To them, his dancing is just a footnote. Denise Guerra, NPR News.

It was the end of Ramadan. And the mood was festive, until an ISIS suicide blast killed almost 300 people. Adel was one of them. His mentor Jonathan Hollander received an anonymous Facebook message about Adel's death. He told the sender not to tell him the details. HOLLANDER: I loved Adel like a son. Please don't send me the pictures, I can't see them. I want to remember him as the beautiful, happy young man whom I knew. GUERRA: Adel's friends and family continue to mourn him on social media. They say the older generation knows him as a lawyer and a loving son. To them, his dancing is just a footnote.

JENNIFER GLASSE, BYLINE: It's a pleasure being on air. MARTIN: Can you tell us any more about the circumstances this morning? What happened? How many people were involved? GLASSE: Well, there were thousands of people demonstrating in Kabul. The streets have been blocked off by the government to prevent the demonstration from getting to the presidential palace, and so the demonstrators had been setting up tents in the middle of this street when the suicide bombers detonated, killing dozens of people. And because the roads were closed because of the demonstration, it was very difficult for people to get to the hospitals. After the explosions went off, there were bodies scattered down the street. It was a very grim sight. MARTIN: How do we know that the Islamic State was responsible? GLASSE: They claimed responsibility for the attack, saying that they targeted mainly the Shia Hazaras. The Islamic State believed that the Shia don't rate as people. Now, this is the first time the Islamic State has made any kind of attack in an urban area in Afghanistan. They've basically been limited to rural eastern Afghanistan where they've done some nasty things in villages and terrorized villagers in small villages in Nangarhar province. But this is the first time they've attacked in the Afghan capital. MARTIN: Did they give some reason why they targeted this particular group of people? You mentioned that they were members of the Hazara minority. Was there some reason given for this? GLASSE: Well, the Islamic State has been resurgent in recent weeks and President Ghani told his military to launch an offensive, which they did this week against the Islamic State in eastern Afghanistan. So that may be what precipitated this attack - the fact that the Hazaras were all together and in one place, maybe made it an attractive target. The government says it didn't have any intelligence that the - it would be targeted by Islamic State. And it does mark the very first time that the Islamic State has been able to strike in central Kabul. These were men dressed in burkas who detonated themselves in this crowd. And I think it's going to make many Afghans wonder if there are more Islamic State bombers who have gotten past the security services and maybe could attack again.

That's because the last remaining road in and out of the city, the road that brought food and supplies and aid has now been cut off. It's called Castello Road and Chicago surgeon Samer Attar traveled that road earlier this month. SAMER ATTAR: They were bombed on buildings on either side. You'd see smoke rising from ordinance that had dropped previously. We passed burnt vehicles, which literally littered the road. Whether or not you made it through, depended on whether or not it was being bombarded by helicopters or jets. MCEVERS: Attar did get through, and then he spent two weeks volunteering at a hospital in Aleppo that is now underground. Hospitals have been repeatedly targeted by Syrian government airstrikes. Attar has been to Aleppo many times, but he says this was the worst he's ever seen it. ATTAR: The first patient I saw was a 5 year old in the intensive care unit that was paralyzed from the chest down when shrapnel embedded in his spinal cord. And as we walked in, they were putting a breathing tube down to help him breathe, and he passed away a few days later. And next to him was a mother in her 30s who - she was at home when a barrel bomb landed, and she lost her 3-month-old, her unborn child, her fetus. She lost two of her children, and that was my first day there. And then after that, the bombings never stopped. MCEVERS: Are there any other memories that still stay with you, you know - things that you still think about from your time there? ATTAR: I still keep thinking about this little girl I took care of. She was one of the last people I operated on. She was around 8. She had her hand blown up from a bomb, and it was right after a big massacre where the emergency room was flooded with people. And all the operating rooms were full, and some people were having operations done in the hallway. Everyone knew that Castello Road might get cut at some point, but I didn't know it was going to be happening right around the time I was there. So that night, when I finished operating, I was told that the road was closed. And that we were permanently sieged with no way in or no way out. That's not a pleasant sensation, and it was my - the closest I felt to tasting the fear and the horror and the despair, which the people of Aleppo are experiencing right now because the road is cut. But a few days thereafter, the road was permanently sealed off. It's - now it's just a catastrophe. MCEVERS: What are people who are still in Aleppo telling you about what it's like now that this road has been cut? ATTAR: Well, before there were some pockets of life. There were kids going to underground schools. There were fruit markets. But now I got a text two days ago from one of the last remaining neurosurgeons in Aleppo. He told me that he's exhausted. He's working around the clock. There's been no fresh fruit, no fresh meat, no fresh cooking oil. And he's eating dry dates to keep him going to give him energy. So on top of that, they're being bombarded, and he's working around the clock. And I don't know how long they can last like this. MCEVERS: You wrote in your op-ed in The Washington Post that you were pleading with American officials to do something. What do you want them to do? ATTAR: Anyone in Aleppo, any doctor, any rescue worker - the one thing they'll ask for is protection - protection from the skies - and I think a stern, firm warning to the Syrian government and the Russian government to keep the Castello Road open, to stop bombing civilians, schools and hospitals and residential areas. MCEVERS: Will you go back? ATTAR: I would go back. MCEVERS: What does your family think about that? ATTAR: That's - those are always tough discussions. But this is just what makes me tick, so I think they understand that. MCEVERS: That's Chicago surgeon Samer Attar. He recently spent a couple weeks volunteering at a hospital in the Syrian city of Aleppo. Doctor Attar, thank you very much for your time today. ATTAR: Thank you very much.

They took five people hostage, and they killed a priest before French police shot and killed them. The Islamic State claimed responsibility. One of the assailants had been jailed for trying twice to enter Syria and had been placed under surveillance with an electronic bracelet. Reporter Jake Cigainero is with us now. And first, Jake, briefly describe what happened inside the church in Saint-Etienne-du-Rouvray. JAKE CIGAINERO: Hi, Robert. Yes - so this morning around 9:43 during a daily mass service, two men entered with knives and attacked the priest and slit his throat. One of the nuns who was attending the service saw the two men enter with the knives, and before they attacked the priest, she was able to run out and raise the alarm with authorities. And so police responded very quickly within about 20 minutes but unfortunately not before this priest had been killed. SIEGEL: Now, as I mentioned, one of the attackers was known to the police. What do we know about him? CIGAINERO: That's right. So he has formally been identified according to the French Press Agency, and French media are calling him Adel K. Apparently he tried to go to Syria twice last year and was stopped the first time in Munich and the second time in the Istanbul airport. He was detained and then questioned for association with terrorist groups. And then he was released earlier this year in March with an electronic bracelet to keep tabs on him. But we do know that he was allowed to leave his house in the morning on a daily basis. So that's when he took this opportunity to attack this church. SIEGEL: Now, one detail I've heard attributed to people who were in the church was that the two men recorded themselves inside the church and were saying something in Arabic inside the church. What was that about? CIGAINERO: That's right. One of the nuns said that the two men made the priests kneel and then filmed themselves slitting his throat, and they yelled Allahu akbar, which is, God is the greatest, God is great in Arabic. SIEGEL: In the last three major terror attacks in France - the Charlie Hebdo attacks, the killings at the Bataclan Concert Hall and other places in Paris and then the Bastille Day attack in Nice - in each case, one or more of the attackers was already known to French anti-terrorism services or had a police record. Does this raise questions of whether the anti-terror police forces in France and the state emergency forces are doing enough to prevent these attacks? CIGAINERO: You know, after the Nice attack, there's been a huge uproar from people saying that the police and that the government particularly didn't do enough to prevent the Nice attack even though the attacker was not known to intelligence services. He was on the radar of local police for domestic violence, but he wasn't known to intelligence services who monitor potential terrorists. And so I think France is still in shock over what's happened in this small town church today, and it's only a matter of days before they start accusing the government again. SIEGEL: Was the idea of an attack on a church something that French authorities were expecting at all? CIGAINERO: The country's been concerned about the threat against churches for about a year. Last year, authorities arrested a man named Sid Ahmed Ghlam, who's a 24-year-old Algerian man who had amassed a trove of weapons in his Paris apartment, and he was thought to be planning an attack on at least one church. So authorities have been on high alert across the country for all places of worship, not just Christian churches but synagogues and mosques as well. SIEGEL: What did to French President Francois Hollande have to say about this today? CIGAINERO: Francois Hollande said this is a vile act, and he said to attack a Christian church is to profane France. He said the terror alert is still very high and will remain very high, especially now that we're facing this group he calls Daesh, ISIS, which has declared war. And Prime Minister Manuel Valls said it's an attempt to provoke a religious war. SIEGEL: Reporter Jake Cigainero in Paris - Jake, thanks for talking with us. CIGAINERO: Thank you, Robert.

There was champagne, dignitaries like Prince Albert of Monaco and an army band which played the national anthem of the United Arab Emirates. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)KELLY MCEVERS, HOST: Why all the fuss? This flight was the final leg of a trip all the way around the world using solar power - two pilots, 17 flights, 23 days in the air over the course of a year and a half, no fuel. SIEGEL: We reached pilot Piccard by Skype fresh off the celebration on the tarmac. BERTRAND PICCARD: You know, I'm arriving now in the hotel room. I don't know where is the light. SIEGEL: Piccard has been going nonstop. Even from the cockpit he did interviews promoting clean energy technology. On this latest flight, he took a call from U. N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who called the trip historic for humanity. MCEVERS: But Piccard says most of the time you're flying, it's pretty quiet, just you and the sun for days. PICCARD: You live in the cockpit. You eat. You go to the toilet. You sleep little naps of 20 minutes. You wash yourself with wet wipes. And you fly the plane. MCEVERS: This last flight was complicated by the heat of the Middle East along with turbulence and the need to navigate no-fly zones. It also was long - took two days and 37 minutes. The plane can be in the air so long because it doesn't need to refuel. PICCARD: It flies forever. It's endless endurance because it takes the sun during the day to charge the batteries and run the motors, and the batteries are used at night to run the motors until the next sunrise. And then you continue. SIEGEL: It'll be a long time before we board a solar plane at the airport. Even with these one-man flights, the plane's batteries got fried at one point, and the whole project was delayed for months. Then there's the weather. The plane can only take off when conditions are just right. MCEVERS: Piccard takes all that in stride. He's a fierce advocate for solar technology and its promise and says Solar Impulse 2 is just the start. PICCARD: Going around the world, it's a first in the history of aviation. But it's also a first in the history of energy, and this is what we want to demonstrate. SIEGEL: Right now Piccard told us he's mostly just relieved that they finally did it. PICCARD: Actually, you know, I'm just so happy and elated to have succeeded in this dream that I had since 15 years. Of course I'm also moved to because it's finished now. I was quite sad this morning when I shut down the engines for the last time. I might never fly again with that plane, so it was very, very moving. MCEVERS: Among those who greeted pilot Bertrand Piccard in Abu Dhabi were his three daughters and his wife, Michele. She also works for Solar Impulse in communications. Just before the final takeoff, she spoke about how proud she was of her husband's adventure, and she quoted Victor Hugo, who said nothing is more powerful than an idea whose time has come.

Russia is suspected of stealing thousands of internal emails from the Democratic National Committee, and in sports, Russia is once again at odds with the West, this time over a state-sponsored doping scheme. So it seems like an odd time for the U. S. to share military intelligence with Russia. But as NPR's David Welna reports, that is just what Secretary of State John Kerry is proposing. DAVID WELNA, BYLINE: Secretary Kerry started pushing for a deal to cooperate in Syria 12 days ago with a trip to Moscow where he met with Sergey Lavrov, his Russian counterpart. Yesterday the two met again, this time in Laos. Kerry spoke to reporters there after that meeting. (SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE)JOHN KERRY: In simple terms, what everybody knows we're trying to do is strengthen the cessation of hostilities, provide a framework which allows us to actually get to the table and have a real negotiation. WELNA: The negotiation would be to end Syria's brutal civil war and set up a transitional government. To get there, Kerry would have the U. S. share intelligence with Russia to target airstrikes against an al-Qaida affiliate called The Nusra Front. In exchange, Russia would prevail on its ally, the regime of Bashar al-Assad, to stop bombing moderate rebel groups and civilians. ROBERT FORD: I think there are many questions about Russia's intent in all of thisWELNA: That's Robert Ford, the last American ambassador to Syria. He's now a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute. Things have changed a lot, Ford says, since last fall when Russia joined the fighting in Syria and Obama administration officials saw Moscow ending up in a quagmire. FORD: Russians and their Syrian government allies are winning on the battlefield right now. The Russians have escalated sharply. The Iranians have also escalated sharply, sent in many more men. And the Syrian government had advanced on the ground. WELNA: Which may be why officials at the Pentagon seem wary about the deal Kerry's trying to cut with Moscow. Defense Secretary Ash Carter was asked about it earlier this week at a news conference. (SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE)ASH CARTER: I'm very enthusiastic about the idea of the Russians getting on side and doing the right thing. I think that would be a good thing if they did. I think we're a ways from getting that frame of mind in Russia. WELNA: And that's because, Carter added, Russia's been bombing Syria's moderate opposition groups instead of extremists. (SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE)CARTER: They obviously have been backing the regime, which has had the effect of prolonging the civil war, whereas we had hoped that they would promote a political solution and transition to put an end to the civil war. WELNA: Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Joe Dunford was asked at the same news conference about reports that Russia hacked the Democratic National Committee's computers. He did not dismiss those reports. (SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE)JOSEPH DUNFORD: We're well aware of state actors who include Russia that have attempted to penetrate our network. WELNA: Still, Dunford insisted the deal being pursued with Russia on Syria is not founded on trust. (SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE)DUNFORD: There will be specific procedures and processes in any transaction we might have with the Russians that would account for protecting our operational security. WELNA: The deal's details remain under wraps. Secretary Kerry says more homework still has to be done in what he calls a series of quiet meetings. (SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE)KERRY: In order to make certain that the doubts expressed by Secretary Carter, by Chairman Dunford or the doubts expressed by President Putin or the Russians are going to be addressed ahead of time. WELNA: Removing those doubts may not be easy. Some officials in Washington, especially in the intelligence community, say Kerry's being played by Moscow - that while he's holding in his hand fives and sixes, Russia's got the face cards in Syria.

Once they get here, many ask for asylum, but applying for asylum isn't easy. So they turn to alternatives, like a visa program that was once obscure, but is now overwhelmed with applicants. NPR's Richard Gonzales reports. RICHARD GONZALES, BYLINE: Alex and Edson Escobar are brothers who traveled to the U. S. separately from El Salvador. Alex, who's 18, came in the summer of 2014. His 16-year-old brother arrived earlier this year. As they sit in their grandparents' modest home in central Virginia, Alex remembers the day he says he knew he would have to leave El Salvador. ALEX ESCOBAR: (Speaking Spanish). GONZALES: \"My father came home drunk one day,\" he says, \"and, for no reason, started hitting my mother. My younger brother Edson and I tried to defend her. \"ESCOBAR: (Speaking Spanish). GONZALES: \"My father was so enraged he grabbed billiard balls and threw them at us. He hit me in the chest. \" Alex says he crashed through a window, cutting his arms, back and hands, and that's when, he says, he knew he had to escape. It wasn't the first time Alex, his brother Edson and their mom had been abused by their father. Violence was always a part of growing up, he says. ESCOBAR: (Speaking Spanish). GONZALES: \"And that was my life in El Salvador,\" he says. As Alex speaks, his younger brother Edson is looking at an iPad with a picture of their mother, who is still in El Salvador. She isn't eligible for a visa. EDSON ESCOBAR: Yes, mi mama. (Speaking Spanish). GONZALES: \"She's my mother, and sometimes I feel sad when I think I may not see her again. Yes, I miss my mother a lot,\" he says. ESCOBAR: (Speaking Spanish). GONZALES: The boys left home hoping to join their maternal grandparents, who migrated legally to the U. S. about five years ago. But because the brothers came separately, two years apart, they face possibly different outcomes. There's a visa called Special Immigrant Juvenile Status for kids just like Alex and Edson who have been abused, abandoned or neglected. The visa was designed for humanitarian reasons, but it has its critics. DAVID NORTH: We're tolerating a whole lot of illegal immigration. GONZALES: David North is with the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank in Washington, D. C. , advocating for reduced immigration. NORTH: As we tolerate a lot of illegal immigration, we create massive income inequality. And so you have a question of what's good for society, and then you've got a question of what's good for these young men. And you've got a conflict. LENNI BENSON: To the restrictionists, I would say - is that all this country can do? GONZALES: Lenni Benson teaches immigration law at the New York Law School in Manhattan. BENSON: They don't come at the border and say, hey, I want to apply for an I-360 based on the Fourth Preference Employment-Based Special Immigrant Juvenile 101A-27J. They say, I can't go home. GONZALES: Still, the demand for this visa is exploding. In 2010, less than 1,600 such visas were issued. Last year, the number shot up to over five times that. That's why the State Department in April announced that visas for young people from El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala had maxed out until the new fiscal year, creating a backlog of applicants. TANISHKA CRUZ: And that has never happened before in the past, so it's a completely novel issue. GONZALES: Tanishka Cruz is a lawyer with the Legal Aid Justice Center, a group that helps low-income residents in Virginia, like Alex and Edson. She's talking about their case outside a fast food restaurant where the boys have stopped to eat. CRUZ: Prior to that announcement, I was able to tell a child, you know, this is what you should expect at every stage of litigation, but now it's a lot more unclear. GONZALES: What's unclear is how long the special immigrant juvenile will have to wait to get a visa and, with it, a green card and work authorization. As for Alex Escobar, in May, he went before an immigration officer. And he was told he would get a visa when one becomes available, perhaps in October, but there are no guarantees when it will happen. Meanwhile, his brother Edson's case could take years to resolve because he just arrived here, and there are so many other Central American juveniles ahead of him. He says he's trying to stay positive. ESCOBAR: (Speaking Spanish). GONZALES: \"I would feel sad if it didn't work out, as all my dreams collapsed and the possibility to succeed and better myself disappeared because it's not possible to do that in El Salvador,\" he says. The problem, says law professor Lenni Benson, is that no one knows how long someone like Edson could remain in limbo. BENSON: I think the important thing about the Central American issue is to see it as another refugee crisis and not to see it as the same as other patterns of overstay or unlawful entry migration. GONZALES: The good news, says Benson, is that Alex and Edson Escobar have legal help. There are thousands of kids, she says, who were abused, abandoned or neglected who have no help at all.

The latest government decree issued under a state of emergency will force 130 media outlets to close. NPR's Peter Kenyon joined us from Istanbul for more. Good morning. PETER KENYON, BYLINE: Morning, Renee. MONTAGNE: Now, this clampdown seems to just keep expanding. What can you tell us about the latest people or group of people to be affected? KENYON: Well, starting with the media, there's, as you said, about 130 closures. Now, this means newspapers, magazines, radio and TV stations, also things like publishing houses, all kinds of media the government says are connected to the cleric Fethullah Gulen. Now, the government says Gulen was behind this attempted coup. He denies it. He's trying not to get extradited from the U. S. , where he lives. Under these emergency rules here in Turkey, the media can be closed, they say, for spreading propaganda designed to panic the population. We also probably should note that some of those media organizations listed were already shut down. I mean, two of the best-known pro-Gulen media - the Cihan news agency and Zaman newspaper group, a couple of the best-known program-Gulen media outlets - they were seized by court-appointed trustees back in March, well before this coup attempt. They were not publishing anything critical of the government. And yet a number of Zaman journalists were arrested yesterday. So basically, we just have to wait and see what kind of evidence the government offers in the future. But at the moment, critics say it just looks like having some kind of tie to Gulen is itself reason to be rounded up. MONTAGNE: Well, I mean, Turkey has had a pretty lively media, although, as you just mention, there was a media crackdown going on at somewhat of a lower pace even before this coup. But how are people - Turks - reacting to this? KENYON: Well, the reaction is dismay and protest from those who are media advocates and free speech advocates. But the public in general, it's pretty muted. A lot of people here, especially government critics, are laying low. They're worried that any criticism of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan or the government right now could mean they too could be caught up in this crackdown. MONTAGNE: Now, this new emergency decree also affects the military. It continues a purge of the armed forces. What about that? KENYON: Well, the government decree says 1,684 military personnel are getting the sack, dishonorable discharges. This is enlisted men all the way up to generals and admirals. And this comes just as a promised overhaul of the armed forces is getting underway. And the military was long an independent power center here in Turkish politics, but no longer. The Supreme Military Council is meeting as early as today to discuss this shakeup. And they are brought under day-to-day control of the government by this state of emergency. That means the government gets to be in charge of all the hiring, firing, all the basic decisions. And now the coast guard and Gendarmerie are also added to that by this latest decree. MONTAGNE: And our people there are asking where this is leading and when is it going to end? KENYON: Oh, yes. The questions are there. It's answers that are needed. The state of emergency's supposed to last three months. Government's giving very mixed signals. Some officials say maybe it will be over in a few weeks. Others say, well, it could be extended if necessary. There's kind of a feeling here the government wants to strike quickly and strongly while it's got these extra powers.

Israeli authorities have reduced the flow to hundreds of thousands of Palestinians, and some Israelis, too. The water shortage has to do with a hot summer and a political battle between the two sides. NPR's Daniel Estrin reports from the West Bank. DANIEL ESTRIN, BYLINE: One day in early June, people in the Palestinian village of Sarta and neighboring villages opened their taps and out came a trickle. Many people haven't had running water for months now. In some places, Israeli authorities have cut the flow by up to two-thirds, says Palestinian water engineer Eyad Yaqob. EYAD YAQOB: If you go to the home, and you don't have water more than two weeks in your home. You don't have - when you open the tap or you open in the toilet, you'll not find any water. It is miserable. ESTRIN: And expensive. Yaqob took me to see Awela Musleh, a mother of six who's been buying water at a premium from enterprising Palestinians who truck it in from other areas. She keeps the water in buckets and uses it to shower by hand and flush the toilet and clean her dishes. AWELA MUSLEH: (Foreign language spoken). ESTRIN: \"Look at how dirty my house is. I'm embarrassed,\" she says. \"I focus on drinking, not cleaning. \"Israel's water authority controls the water system in the West Bank and says it reduced the flow in some areas for a few reasons. It's been an especially hot summer, and people were using too much. Even in Jewish settlements there have been disruptions. But they're much more severe in Palestinian areas. Israel blames the Palestinians for tapping into pipes and stealing water. And it says Palestinian pipes are leaking. But Palestinians refuse to coordinate with Israel to repair them, as required by the Oslo Peace Accords signed about 20 years ago. Emmanuel Nahshon is the spokesman of the Israeli Foreign Ministry. EMMANUEL NAHSHON: We would like very much to have a joint working mechanism in order to deal with those water issues. But the Palestinians have systematically refused to participate in the coordinating mechanism. ESTRIN: That coordinating mechanism is a joint water committee that both sides must convene to approve any water projects in the West Bank, whether it be for Jewish settlers or Palestinians. NAHSHON: Unfortunately, we do not have this kind of joint effort that we would like to see. ESTRIN: Palestinian water engineers say the problem isn't leaky pipes. The U. S. government has laid new water infrastructure for the Palestinians in the area where water's been cut. Something else is going on here, Yaqob says. YAQOB: The problem - Israelis, they want to pressure the Palestinians, to put the pressure in the Palestinian Water Authority, to tell them come and sit in the table in the joint water committee. ESTRIN: And that's where you get into politics. Fadi Abdel Ghani of the Palestinian Water Authority says the Palestinians refuse to participate in the committee because the Israeli members will only approve water improvements for Palestinians if the Palestinians approve projects for Jewish settlements. Palestinians oppose Jewish settlements because they're built in occupied territory they want for their own state. FADI ABDEL GHANI: In the end, no one of us can sign such documents for them. If you want to give me water, I have to approve projects for the settlements? No. ESTRIN: Palestinian village leaders say they're rotating water between villages to share the little they have. They complain of people going to the main valve at night and redirecting the supply out of turn, and residents have staged sit-ins to protest the shortages. Palestinian water expert Yaqob says Palestinians and Israelis in the area are drawing from the same aquifer, and they need to work together. YAQOB: The water and environment, you cannot live without us and we cannot live without you. If we don't have any cooperation between us and water - and wastewater and environment, you will face a problem. If not - you not face it now, you will face it in the future. ESTRIN: Yaqob notes that the 1995 Oslo peace agreement gave Israel control over most of the West Bank's water. But over the years, Israel has increased its own water supply with desalination plants. Yaqob says it's time to renegotiate the old deal, to share more with the Palestinians. Daniel Estrin, NPR News, Sarta in the West Bank. SCOTT SIMON, HOST:  There's a water crisis in parts of the West Bank this summer. Israeli authorities have reduced the flow to hundreds of thousands of Palestinians, and some Israelis, too. The water shortage has to do with a hot summer and a political battle between the two sides. NPR's Daniel Estrin reports from the West Bank. DANIEL ESTRIN, BYLINE: One day in early June, people in the Palestinian village of Sarta and neighboring villages opened their taps and out came a trickle. Many people haven't had running water for months now. In some places, Israeli authorities have cut the flow by up to two-thirds, says Palestinian water engineer Eyad Yaqob. EYAD YAQOB: If you go to the home, and you don't have water more than two weeks in your home. You don't have - when you open the tap or you open in the toilet, you'll not find any water. It is miserable. ESTRIN: And expensive. Yaqob took me to see Awela Musleh, a mother of six who's been buying water at a premium from enterprising Palestinians who truck it in from other areas. She keeps the water in buckets and uses it to shower by hand and flush the toilet and clean her dishes. AWELA MUSLEH: (Foreign language spoken). ESTRIN: \"Look at how dirty my house is. I'm embarrassed,\" she says. \"I focus on drinking, not cleaning. \" Israel's water authority controls the water system in the West Bank and says it reduced the flow in some areas for a few reasons. It's been an especially hot summer, and people were using too much. Even in Jewish settlements there have been disruptions. But they're much more severe in Palestinian areas. Israel blames the Palestinians for tapping into pipes and stealing water. And it says Palestinian pipes are leaking. But Palestinians refuse to coordinate with Israel to repair them, as required by the Oslo Peace Accords signed about 20 years ago. Emmanuel Nahshon is the spokesman of the Israeli Foreign Ministry. EMMANUEL NAHSHON: We would like very much to have a joint working mechanism in order to deal with those water issues. But the Palestinians have systematically refused to participate in the coordinating mechanism. ESTRIN: That coordinating mechanism is a joint water committee that both sides must convene to approve any water projects in the West Bank, whether it be for Jewish settlers or Palestinians. NAHSHON: Unfortunately, we do not have this kind of joint effort that we would like to see. ESTRIN: Palestinian water engineers say the problem isn't leaky pipes. The U. S. government has laid new water infrastructure for the Palestinians in the area where water's been cut. Something else is going on here, Yaqob says.

It has taken back the key city of Fallujah outside of Baghdad. And now, Iraq is turning its attention to the north and the country's second-largest city, Mosul. Mosul has been under ISIS control for the last two years. And for more, I spoke with Lukman Faily. He was Iraq's ambassador to the U. S. for three years before stepping down this summer. And as Ambassador Faily sees it, the U. S. was slow to react to the threat from ISIS. LUKMAN FAILY: There were some politics. I do understand that the administration 2008 said we will pull out of Iraq. 2011, they did pull out of Iraq. So I do understand that. But I also understand that the threat were there, that the stability of the country was not there and the ramification of endangering to - the security of Iraq will have a major effect on the geopolitics of the region and globally. It's an important country. So to that effect, I think we need to focus on the bigger long-term threat we have here and hence collaboration and cooperation moving forward. So I think we need to not forget, learn from history, but not be shackled by history. MONTAGNE: Well, tell us then, in your view, what does need to be done in the next few years? FAILY: We do need to make sure that the politics in the region do allow for dialogue to take place. At this moment, we have issues with security in more or less all the countries. We have issues of immigration, migration to Europe and so on. You see the situation in Europe as well security-wise. So we do have a new phenomenon, as much as global warming was a phenomenon we had, or we still have. We need to get the politics aligned with the security threat we all face. MONTAGNE: But, I mean, exactly how do you do that? The politics have not lined up very well with this security threat these last few years. FAILY: No, because we all have short-termism. We're all thinking about our own elections and - rather than thinking about the strategic leadership needed. U. S. can play a significant role in leading the tide. We're not talking about troops on the ground. Nobody is asking for that. Iraqis have not asked for it. We're paying the - dearly every day for our own liberation. We need to make sure that we have a positive mindset in - for cooperation where we can support each other. This has been an endemic problem in the region. It will have ramifications to the the globe. You cannot run away from it. That's - the geography and the geopolitics of that region is important. Here I think the U. S. needs to have a long view. It can't be solely linked to where this President X or President Y comes into power next - the White House next January. It has to go beyond that. And this - hence my point about what took place after 2008. MONTAGNE: Which was? FAILY: It was the troop withdrawal to an extent where Iraq did not have a single fighter plane, no single fighter plane in 2011 when the American troops left. I think anybody, let alone experts, should tell you you could not - you should never leave a country without a single fighter plane. Whose fault it is - it's our fault, Iraqis. It's your fault, U. S. But put that aside. Let's not be shackled by the history here. We need to look forward. MONTAGNE: So do you believe that your countrymen, that Iraqis are willing to look forward? FAILY: We do because the areas where occupied by ISIS were all Sunnis. If we said, OK, let's have Shiastan (ph), Sunnistan (ph), Kurdistan, we - no fighting would have taken place. But now majority of the fighters are from the south, tribes, local tribes, collaboration with each other, with the Kurd peshmerga fighters, braveheart days (ph). They're fighting on. So this fight does - has told us what I might call a wake up call for us, that we need to have a win-win approach, otherwise we will all lose out. And here includes a U. S. role. When the U. S. were positive in the fight against ISIS, we all won. When the U. S. were somewhat hesitant, we all lost out. MONTAGNE: Lukman Faily just stepped down weeks ago as Iraq's ambassador to the United States. Thank you very much for joining us. FAILY: Thank you again for having me.

S. -based cleric living in Pennsylvania's Pocono Mountains. And many Turks have jumped to a further conclusion. They think the U. S. had a role in the coup attempt. Washington denies this, but let's listen to some of those voices from Turkey. Here's NPR's Peter Kenyon. PETER KENYON, BYLINE: Turks are overwhelmingly convinced the cleric Fethullah Gulen was behind the coup, although some of the evidence is a bit mysterious. Take this 20-second ad from the pro-Gulen Zaman newspaper, which aired last fall, more than nine months before the coup attempt. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)KENYON: It opens with an aerial view of a city as a siren wails. Then the siren cuts off and the silence is broken by a baby's laughter and a boom. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)KENYON: You may ask, how does this prove Gulen was behind the coup? And the social media users who were passing this video around online might reply, the baby is laughing. And what's the Turkish word for laughing? Gulen. But if Gulen was behind the coup and Gulen is in America, does that mean America backed the coup? At an Istanbul barbershop, a knot of men gather around a reporter to say, you bet it does. Ship captain Ugur Yazgan, these days, he mainly runs a yacht for tourists, says everybody knows America's deep state had a hand in the failed coup. UGUR YAZGAN: (Foreign language spoken). KENYON: \"It's obvious the deep state in America was behind this,\" he says, \"including the CIA. The CIA was definitely in on it. And Fethullah Gulen is their tool. \" Turks are well acquainted with the concept of a deep state. Last century, it referred to the secular military elite. In this century, it's come to mean a shadowy network of Gulen supporters. But how do they know the CIA is involved? A man who gives his first name, Levent, says you only need to look at how Gulen got his U. S. residency visa. He's referring to the fact that one of the people who wrote letters supporting Gulen's greencard application is Graham Fuller, a former CIA official. Fuller has written that he wrote the letter as a private citizen and believes Gulen to be a force for moderation in the Islamic world. Turkey experts are watching this expanding anti-American sentiment closely. Asli Bali, director of UCLA's Center for Near East Studies, says so far, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is maintaining two narratives, telling domestic audiences the U. S. does back coups while assuring the West that Turkey doesn't believe America was involved. She wonders if that can last. ASLI BALI: Out of one of those narratives, specifically the narrative alleging a U. S. involvement, becomes the dominant narrative. I think that will signal a decision on the part of the Turkish government to double down on a position that jeopardizes those relationships with NATO, bilaterally with the United States, arguably with the European Union. KENYON: Turkey has talked about pivoting toward the East before. And Russia expert Akin Unver, at Istanbul's Kadir Has University, says the current tensions will certainly look like an opportunity to Moscow, which is worried about NATO forces coming closer to its borders. AKIN UNVER: If NATO is expanding, then Russia's priority is to create disunity, discord. So when Turkey and the United States disagree over something, of course, that rift benefits Russia immensely. KENYON: Unver and his colleague, analyst Ahmet Kasim Han, agree that Turkey's overriding interests remain aligned with those of the West. But Han thinks this immediate crisis may turn on one question, how willing or able Washington may be to turn over Fethullah Gulen to Turkish authorities. AHMET KASIM HAN: It is very, very important. Of course, Turkish side should also realize that much hinges on how to the dossier of extradition is prepared. But nevertheless, the U. S. should be showing the Turkish public that it is genuinely concerned and it's not turning a blind eye or a deaf ear. KENYON: Turks already detect a certain tone deafness in the U. S. response, sending a military general instead of a diplomat as its first post-coup visitor. If Gulen isn't extradited, many Turks will believe their suspicions about the U. S. have been confirmed.

Republican Donald Trump has promised to be a strong president, yet the party platform became less tough on Russia. In particular, it reduced the level of support that would be promised to a government under pressure from Russia. NPR's Brian Naylor reports. BRIAN NAYLOR, BYLINE: When Republican Party leaders drafted the platform prior to their convention in Cleveland last month, they had relatively little input from the campaign of Donald Trump, except perhaps on the one issue, Ukraine. It started when platform committee member Diana Denman tried to insert language calling for the U. S. to provide lethal defensive weapons to the government of Ukraine. DIANA DENMAN: I had no idea I was going into a firefight (laughter). But it has been an interesting exchange to say the least. NAYLOR: Denman is a longtime GOP activist from Texas. Here's how she describes what happened when she presented her proposal during a subcommittee meeting. DENMAN: Two gentlemen came over - that were attending our meeting came over and looked at it and discussed it with the chairman. And then one of the chairmen suggested to our committee and to me that it be set aside for further review, and it was. NAYLOR: The two gentlemen were from the Trump campaign, who convinced the platform committee to change Denman's proposal that the U. S. provide lethal defensive weapons to the more benign phrase appropriate assistance. It's more than semantics. Many Republicans have been demanding the Obama administration provide a more robust response to Russia's incursions. MELINDA HARING: She was steamrolled. She was absolutely steamrolled, and the Trump supporters found someone else to put another amendment forward with this weaker language with appropriate assistance. NAYLOR: That's Melinda Haring with the Atlantic Council, a Washington, D. C. , think tank. She says it's anyone's guess what Trump would do regarding Ukraine and Russia. HARING: One could conclude from Donald Trump's recent statements that he might not even back appropriate assistance to Ukraine. NAYLOR: Haring was referring to Trump's appearance on ABC's \"This Week With George Stephanopoulos\" last month. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"THIS WEEK WITH GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS\")DONALD TRUMP: He's not going into Ukraine, OK? Just so you understand, he's not going to go into Ukraine, all right? You can mark it down. You can put it down. You can take it any way you want. GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, he's already there, isn't he? TRUMP: OK. Well, he's there in a certain way. But I'm not there. You have Obama there. NAYLOR: Of course, Russia did go into Ukraine, invading Crimea two years ago and backing separatist fighters in other parts of the country. Trump later said that he meant Putin would not go into Ukraine on his watch if he were president. Still, that comment combined with his campaign manager Paul Manafort's work for former Ukraine President Viktor Yanukovych, a Putin ally, has raised eyebrows. Rachel Hoff is another GOP delegate who was on the platform committee. Hoff is also a national security analyst with the American Action Forum. RACHEL HOFF: What this signals to me is that they would also refuse to send lethal defensive weapons. And this puts Trump, then, out of step with, certainly Republican leadership, but I would also say, mainstream sort of conservative foreign policy or national security opinion. NAYLOR: Republicans in Congress have approved providing arms to the Ukrainian government, but the White House has resisted, saying that would only encourage more bloodshed. It's a rare Obama administration policy that the Trump campaign seems to agree with. Brian Naylor, NPR News, Washington.

NAYLOR: That's Melinda Haring with the Atlantic Council, a Washington, D. C. , think tank. She says it's anyone's guess what Trump would do regarding Ukraine and Russia. HARING: One could conclude from Donald Trump's recent statements that he might not even back appropriate assistance to Ukraine. NAYLOR: Haring was referring to Trump's appearance on ABC's \"This Week With George Stephanopoulos\" last month. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"THIS WEEK WITH GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS\") DONALD TRUMP: He's not going into Ukraine, OK? Just so you understand, he's not going to go into Ukraine, all right? You can mark it down. You can put it down. You can take it any way you want. GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Well, he's already there, isn't he? TRUMP: OK. Well, he's there in a certain way. But I'm not there. You have Obama there. NAYLOR: Of course, Russia did go into Ukraine, invading Crimea two years ago and backing separatist fighters in other parts of the country. Trump later said that he meant Putin would not go into Ukraine on his watch if he were president. Still, that comment combined with his campaign manager Paul Manafort's work for former Ukraine President Viktor Yanukovych, a Putin ally, has raised eyebrows. Rachel Hoff is another GOP delegate who was on the platform committee. Hoff is also a national security analyst with the American Action Forum. RACHEL HOFF: What this signals to me is that they would also refuse to send lethal defensive weapons. And this puts Trump, then, out of step with, certainly Republican leadership, but I would also say, mainstream sort of conservative foreign policy or national security opinion. NAYLOR: Republicans in Congress have approved providing arms to the Ukrainian government, but the White House has resisted, saying that would only encourage more bloodshed. It's a rare Obama administration policy that the Trump campaign seems to agree with. Brian Naylor, NPR News, Washington.", "section": "Politics", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.

This brutal world has a strict organizational hierarchy and a sophisticated communications network. With us to talk about this is Rukmini Callimachi. She's a foreign correspondent with The New York Times, and she joins me now. Welcome. RUKMINI CALLIMACHI: Thank you for having me, Ailsa. CHANG: So you managed to speak with a German ISIS operative named Harry Sarfo. Tell us a little bit about him. CALLIMACHI: Harry is, to me, an extremely interesting person. He was recruited into ISIS last year from Germany. So he drove from Germany to Turkey and then was smuggled across the border. And because of his nationality - he's a German national, but he also grew up in England and speaks both fluent English and fluent German. He was very quickly recruited by a secretive branch of ISIS known as the Emni, which is the branch that is responsible for dispatching fighters abroad to carry out attacks. He said that the recruiters told him that they had more than enough fighters for France. By contrast, he said that they were weak in Germany and in England, which is why his profile was so interesting to them. CHANG: Sarfo also explains that the person behind the international ISIS network is a man named Abu Muhammad al-Adnani. CALLIMACHI: Yes. CHANG: Who is he? And tell us about him. CALLIMACHI: Adnani is a figure that really should be much more famous. He should be as well-known as Osama bin Laden. He is the spokesman of the group. He's the head of their propaganda. But more importantly, he is the head of the Emni, which is the body that is responsible for exporting terror abroad. CHANG: He's both a strategist and a commander. CALLIMACHI: Exactly, exactly. And from Harry we also see the propaganda of the Islamic State goes hand in hand with their efforts to hit the West. So, for example, before the Paris attacks, we had months and months and months of videos that they were releasing on the order of, you know, practically every two or three weeks showing French foreign fighters threatening France. And we end up not even reporting on these things because, A, they're so frequent and, B, we don't want to elevate and amplify their message. CHANG: Has al-Adnani been linked directly to the Paris attack? CALLIMACHI: He has been linked directly to it as the head of external operations as the person who was leading the body that is carrying out the attacks, yes. CHANG: So eventually Sarfo became disillusioned with ISIS. What happened? CALLIMACHI: There were - there were numerous points along the way, I think, where the reality of the Islamic State started to clash with the idea of this utopia that he had in his head. So it's now, I think, the month of July, 2015. He has been enlisted into ISIS' special forces. Other German fighters come and approach him and ask him to take part in a propaganda video. The main moment in the video is going to involve the execution of men that are allegedly spies. CHANG: They were going to be executed just to be filmed. CALLIMACHI: Just to be filmed, just to be filmed, and they bring out these prisoners. They are introduced as Assad soldiers fighting against the Islamic State. And they've even made them wear camouflage pants to make them look like soldiers. And one of the men who was kneeling starts protesting, and he says, I have nothing to do with the military. I'm just a Sunni Muslim. I'm actually an imam, and he went to name the mosque that he was in. And at that very moment, they shot him. When he realized that they were actually killing a Sunni Muslim and not just any Sunni Muslim but an imam. . . CHANG: Right. CALLIMACHI: . . . Of a mosque, it was one of the moments when their message rang hollow. CHANG: What surprised you the most about what you found out when you were studying this secret global network? CALLIMACHI: What surprised me is I had thought that the purpose of this secret body was mostly to export violence to Europe and specifically to France. And it was from talking to Harry that I realized that, no, it's actually a global effort. And he said there's a department of European affairs. There's a department of Asian affairs. There's a department of North African affairs. And there's a department of Arab affairs. And he gave me examples of attacks that we had covered as attacks but not necessarily connected to ISIS - the Bardo museum attack, as well as the attack on a beach in Tunisia. The fighters who carried out those attacks had trained in Syria. He had met people who had met them and that they had been sent back by the Emni. CHANG: Right. They trained them in Syria or wherever and then they send them back to the home country. That's one model. CALLIMACHI: That's - so that's one model. Those are the directed attacks. But in addition to that, they have a system of clean men (laughter). He describes them as new converts to Islam who are therefore not in the databases in North America or in Europe. They will help that person find explosives. They will give him instructions on how to pledge the oath of allegiance to ISIS. And that was - that was something I hadn't heard of before because what happens after all of these attacks is officials quickly say, we can't find a direct link to ISIS. CHANG: Yeah. CALLIMACHI: And I've now noticed that with a lot of the attacks that have happened, months later we will find that link. It's not necessarily direct. It'll usually involve a go-between. But there will be a link. So among the attacks that were described as lone wolves that are clearly not is the Garland, Texas, attack by Elton Simpson and another young man from Arizona who drove and attacked a community center in Texas. And I can give you many other examples. But Harry's testimony is, I think, important because it suggests that law enforcement, that they're perhaps looking for the wrong variable. It shouldn't be that they're looking for people that are ISIS operatives or directly inside the Islamic State. They should be looking for people that are one degree removed.

This happened to its customers all over the world. A power outage caused a computer network to go down, and that forced the airline to put a ground stop on all of its scheduled flights for several hours. Flight operations have resumed, but hundreds of flights are still delayed, and many more are being canceled. NPR's David Schaper reports the problems may continue for a couple of days. DAVID SCHAPER, BYLINE: It still is not exactly clear what went wrong. Delta says it experienced a power outage at a facility in Atlanta where Delta is based at about 2:30 this morning which in turn caused a computer system failure affecting flight planning and dispatch operations worldwide for several hours. Flights already in the air were not affected. The local electric company, Georgia Power, blames the outage on a piece of Delta's equipment that failed, but a Delta spokesman would not confirm that, saying that the airline is still investigating what caused the outage. Regardless, it made for a miserable day to be scheduled on an early Monday morning Delta flight. GARY NATALE: My flight is 7:15 in the morning generally. SCHAPER: Gary Natale takes the same flight every week from Atlanta to Washington, D. C. NATALE: So I guess it was about a four-and-a-half-hour delay - is what it ultimately came to. SCHAPER: Fortunately for Natale, a co-worker texted him before he left his house, so he stayed and worked from home for a few hours before heading to the airport to stand in line. NATALE: Looks like there's still system problems because we can't get boarding passes on our mobile apps, and it's not pulling up on the kiosks either. So we're forced to stand in line here. SCHAPER: Many travelers got erroneous information in texts, online and on airport departure screens saying that their flights were on time when in reality, they'd be stranded at the airport for hours. Some, such as Terry Lively, just took it all in stride. TERRY LIVELY: It's a business trip, so I've already alerted my customer and said, well, just be aware. And they go, I know; just see what you can do, and if you can't get here, we'll reschedule. So. . . SCHAPER: But others had a lot more at stake. VICTOR THEODORE VIOLETTE: It's kind of sad right now because I was really hoping to see my Grandpa Papier earlier today. SCHAPER: So 11-year-old Victor Theodore Violette had to wait at the airport for a few more hours before visiting grandpa. DANIEL BAKER: It's really a disaster. SCHAPER: Daniel Baker is CEO of the flight tracking company flightaware. comBAKER: To have this sort of disruption where zero flights were taking off for hours - it's one of the largest airlines in the world - it's absolutely massive. So tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of folks are impacted or will be impacted. SCHAPER: The computer outage at Delta as well as other recent technology meltdowns at Southwest a couple of weeks ago, at United earlier this summer and at American Airlines last year all raise questions about whether the airlines have adequate backup systems. BAKER: I think there's no question that with United's and Southwest's and now Delta's outages and experiences, we're going to see a huge investment on behalf of the airlines towards more reliable infrastructure.

NPR's Peter Kenyon has more from Istanbul. PETER KENYON, BYLINE: These days, Turks tend to look on Russians with a smile and Americans with suspicion, quite the reverse of the mood less than a year ago. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED CROWD: (Chanting, unintelligible). KENYON: At a massive Istanbul rally Sunday honoring the Turks who died resisting the coup effort, Erdogan condemned the U. S. -based cleric Fethullah Gulen, accused of ordering the coup. Many Turks are angry that Gulen is finding shelter in America despite the elderly cleric's denials of any involvement. They cheered as Erdogan, heard here through an interpreter, promised to go after Gulen and what he called the powers behind him. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT RECEP TAYYIP ERDOGAN: (Through interpreter) We are joining forces, and this I am sure is saddening our enemies as it did on the 16th of July, the following morning after the coup attack. We are going to be one Turkey, one single country. KENYON: For decades, Turkey has joined forces with the West, with NATO, with Europe and the United States. It was a frontline NATO state against the Soviet Union during the Cold War. But now some are wondering if Erdogan's Russia visit coming at a time of strong anti-American feelings at home should be seen as something more than a symbolic diplomatic foray. AKIN UNVER: Well, of course it should. KENYON: Akin Unver, a Russia expert at Istanbul's Kadir Has University, says Russia has an overriding strategic objective to keep NATO forces as far from its borders as it can, and that means any dispute among NATO members, especially tension between Turkey and the U. S. , is a gift to Moscow. UNVER: That rift benefits Russia immensely because if Turkey and United States and the rest of NATO countries work together really well, it's bad news for Russia. KENYON: Until recently, Turkey and Russia were exchanging hostile rhetoric and more. In November, Turkey shot down a Russian fighter jet it said strayed into Turkish airspace from Syria. Moscow promptly banned the import of Turkish goods and barred its citizens from vacationing in Turkey, a sharp economic blow. Restoring trade would be a big help to both countries right now. There's even renewed talk of running Russian natural gas through Turkey. And analyst Unver says with Russian jets still active in Syria, mending ties will reduce one of the many potential threats facing Turkey these days. UNVER: Does Russia have any chance of having any military threat to Turkey? Normally no, but now that Russia's deployed in Syria, Turkey is going to find itself militarily pressured both from the north and from the south. KENYON: Unver believes Turkey's overriding goals remain much more in line with Washington than Moscow, but that won't stop the West from watching this diplomatic engagement very closely.

Many of his colleagues gathered at the hospital to remember him, which is when a bomb exploded at that hospital killing more than 60 people. We're going to talk about this with Fahd Husain, a columnist and top editor with Express News in Lahore. Welcome to the program, sir. FAHD HUSAIN: Thank you very much. INSKEEP: What's known about the man whose killing came first? HUSAIN: Well, just happened this morning, and it started when a top lawyer was killed. And then when they took his body to the morgue, that's when the other attack happened, which, according to police, was a suicide bomber. Now, this clearly means that it was a targeted operation. And it was meant to inflict maximum casualties, and that it has. It has been a terrible, terrible day, a big tragedy in Pakistan at a time when a general perception was that things are improving. . . INSKEEP: What does it mean - and forgive me, there's a bit of a delay on the line here, so it might be a bit awkward. But what does it mean that a lawyer, particularly, would be killed in this city that's near the border with Afghanistan in a province where there's been an insurgency over the years - there's been a lot of problems there. But what does it mean that a lawyer would be targeted? HUSAIN: Well, in the past, there have been a number of people who have been targeted in different capacities in Quetta's history because the violence has been so wide-expressed. And there are so many different terror groups, including (unintelligible) sectarian groups, who've been targeting different people. But it's very difficult to say why this particular lawyer was killed. It could be a sectarian. It could be anything else. And it's not obvious because nobody's actually claimed responsibility for this. So it would be a guess why he in particular was targeted. INSKEEP: One other thing - you mentioned that this is a period where it had seemed that things were becoming calmer in Pakistan. What was the mood in the country before this attack? HUSAIN: Well, the mood has been upbeat. The last couple of years, the condition has improved dramatically. The number of terror incidents and attacks so far have come down. Terror groups are on the run. And generally, the comfort level is high. There are occasional attacks here and there. But this - an attack on this scale hasn't happened for a while. So generally, there's a sense of shock that at a time when we felt that things were getting better, the terrorists have made a comeback with this horrific attack. And I think it has damaged that perception that things were getting under control. INSKEEP: Fahd Husain, thank you very much for taking the time to speak with us this morning, appreciate it. He's a columnist and top editor with Express News in Lahore. And he's talking with us on this day when we've learned of a double attack in Pakistan. First, a lawyer was killed. And then when friends, colleagues, loved ones gathered at a hospital to remember his death, to mourn his death, what is believed to have been a suicide bomber struck. There was an explosion. And the latest information is that more than 60 people have been killed. We'll bring you more on this story as we learn it. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:   Here's what happened in a major Pakistani city today - someone shot and killed a lawyer in Quetta. Many of his colleagues gathered at the hospital to remember him, which is when a bomb exploded at that hospital killing more than 60 people. We're going to talk about this with Fahd Husain, a columnist and top editor with Express News in Lahore. Welcome to the program, sir. FAHD HUSAIN: Thank you very much. INSKEEP: What's known about the man whose killing came first? HUSAIN: Well, just happened this morning, and it started when a top lawyer was killed. And then when they took his body to the morgue, that's when the other attack happened, which, according to police, was a suicide bomber. Now, this clearly means that it was a targeted operation. And it was meant to inflict maximum casualties, and that it has. It has been a terrible, terrible day, a big tragedy in Pakistan at a time when a general perception was that things are improving. . . INSKEEP: What does it mean - and forgive me, there's a bit of a delay on the line here, so it might be a bit awkward. But what does it mean that a lawyer, particularly, would be killed in this city that's near the border with Afghanistan in a province where there's been an insurgency over the years - there's been a lot of problems there. But what does it mean that a lawyer would be targeted? HUSAIN: Well, in the past, there have been a number of people who have been targeted in different capacities in Quetta's history because the violence has been so wide-expressed. And there are so many different terror groups, including (unintelligible) sectarian groups, who've been targeting different people. But it's very difficult to say why this particular lawyer was killed. It could be a sectarian. It could be anything else. And it's not obvious because nobody's actually claimed responsibility for this. So it would be a guess why he in particular was targeted. INSKEEP: One other thing - you mentioned that this is a period where it had seemed that things were becoming calmer in Pakistan. What was the mood in the country before this attack? HUSAIN: Well, the mood has been upbeat. The last couple of years, the condition has improved dramatically. The number of terror incidents and attacks so far have come down. Terror groups are on the run. And generally, the comfort level is high. There are occasional attacks here and there. But this - an attack on this scale hasn't happened for a while. So generally, there's a sense of shock that at a time when we felt that things were getting better, the terrorists have made a comeback with this horrific attack.

Trump does have the support of a longtime Democrat, retired Lieutenant General Michael Flynn. Flynn is a former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, and he's a critic of President Obama's Syria policy. He spoke at the Republican Convention. He's also written a book called \"The Field Of Fight,\" which portrays the United States facing a loose coalition of enemies, such as Iran and Russia. If Trump is friendly toward Russia, Flynn thinks that's OK. There must be some relationship. And like his candidate, Flynn also sees a problem with radical Islam. MICHAEL FLYNN: Something is happening in this Islamic ideology. And the rise of radical Islamism is really dangerous for the world. And we cannot have this just sort of, well, we're always going to have to deal with this problem. I don't think that that's a good answer. INSKEEP: Do you think that banning Muslims from entering the United States and sending that signal to all of them around the world is going to encourage Muslims to take a friendlier posture toward the West? FLYNN: This is not about a permanent ban. This is about understanding what is happening with this rapid rise of radical Islamism. And we know, Steve, that the Islamic State has - and they've stated it - they actually stated it in their various media outlets - that they are going to infiltrate into the refugee populations that are entering different countries around the world. They've said that. So I think that what we have to do is we have to recognize, how do we screen, vet and properly, you know, document those individuals who are coming into our country. . . INSKEEP: You raise a good point, General, when you talk about. . . FLYNN: Yeah. INSKEEP: . . . Clarifying this. And I appreciate you saying that because Trump initially did say he wanted not a permanent, but a temporary ban of. . . FLYNN: Right. INSKEEP: . . . All Muslims. . . FLYNN: Right, right. INSKEEP: Then he began making exceptions. Maybe there's some Muslims he would let in. Then he gave a national security speech at which he, instead of a religion, which was widely criticized, talked about banning people from particular countries where terrorists were active. Critics have since noted that you'd have to ban people from France. You'd have to ban people from the United States from coming to the United States because there's been terrorist acts all over the world. In the end, do we have here a laudable effort to protect the United States from all harm that is just not workable at all? FLYNN: Well, I think that's a great question to ask. And I would love to hear that question, Steve, asked in one of the upcoming debates. I think that our responsibility is for safety and protection of American citizens abroad and at home. I think that's the principal duty, you know. . . INSKEEP: But does that. . . FLYNN: . . . What. . . INSKEEP: I asked, is this just not workable to ban whole classes of people? You agree with that - that it's not working. FLYNN: Well, I - yeah. I mean, you can't just say, you know, blanket. But what you have to do is recognize that we have a completely different threat environment that we are dealing with now. So we have to think differently, and we have to use some imagination. And we have to still protect our American values and what we represent to the rest of the world. So to put a blanket on any organization, any segment of the population, is not workable. But we do have to recognize what types of things must we be able to do to continue to protect our own country and our way of life. INSKEEP: One other thing I want to ask about, General Flynn. . . FLYNN: Yeah. INSKEEP: . . . Some people will know that you spent more than 30 years in the military. How much does experience matter when you're trying to make wise decisions about foreign policy? FLYNN: Yeah, I think experience matters a lot. I think judgment matters a lot. I think that instincts come with experience. I do think that there is also something to be said about accountability and responsibility. I believe that we have a political class in our country that has - doesn't even know what accountability and responsibility even means anymore to the American public. And that includes one of the, you know, one of the candidates running for president United States, and that's Hillary Clinton. I just - I don't see that. INSKEEP: I want to zero in on one thing that you said you said. You said experience was important for so many reasons, one of them being that it helps you develop the right instincts. You're supporting a candidate who has no experience in foreign policy and says that he relies on his instincts, rather than reading a lot of books, for example. What evidence, specifically, have you seen that he has mastered foreign policy questions? FLYNN: Well, I would say, one, is he's got a good grasp for the kind of people that he does bring around him, and he's a great listener. I know that in some of the conversations - very strategic conversations about, you know, the way the world is and the way the world can be if America remains very strong, especially economically, you know, there's an awful lot of presidents that, prior to becoming the president, had very little experience, to include Barack Obama. I mean, Barack Obama had almost zero foreign policy experience, if any. INSKEEP: Lieutenant General Michael Flynn. Thanks very much, General. FLYNN: Thanks, Steve. INSKEEP: General Flynn has advised Donald Trump and is the author of \"The Field Of Fight: How We Can Win The Global War Against Radical Islam And Its Allies. \" STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  Fifty Republican security experts released a letter yesterday saying Trump is unfit to be president, said he'd be the most reckless president in American history.

It is also blaming foreigners for having instigated the coup. One of them is Henri Barkey, a scholar who was born in Turkey and now runs the Middle East Program at the Woodrow Wilson Center here in Washington. Welcome to the show. HENRI BARKEY: Thank you. SHAPIRO: On the night of the coup attempt, you were attending a conference in Istanbul, and then Turkey accused you of playing a role in the coup. Before we get into the significance of that, I just have to ask. Did you play any role in this? BARKEY: (Laughter) Of course not. I mean I was on an island 45 minutes from Istanbul, and actually it was a conference that I had organized - actually a workshop on Iran and its neighbors - had nothing to do with Turkey. SHAPIRO: What was your reaction when you heard that you were being blamed in part for this? BARKEY: Well, at first I thought, you know, there are a lot of conspiracy theorists in Turkey, so couple of them decided to go after me. Although there were a couple of worrying signals that this was actually more significant than that because one of the first articles that appeared on me had the exact time I actually went through passport control coming in and going out of Turkey. And this is something only the security services would have, not some columnist who doesn't do much research, and so that was worrying. And then it turned into a massive campaign against me, America in general, my colleagues at the Wilson Center but also my colleagues who had come with me to Istanbul to do this workshop and, most importantly, my Turkish colleagues who were part of organizing this workshop. So it was actually very upsetting in that sense. SHAPIRO: What has happened to some of the people in Turkey who have been targeted? What have you heard from your friends and colleagues? BARKEY: Well, what I've heard is that two of the Turkish participants were suspended from their academic jobs, although only one person's name has appeared in the press. My co-organizer was brought into security headquarters and interrogated about all the details of the conference. And there are all these stories that they have open court cases or they're planning to open court cases against all the participants, including all the foreigners and myself, obviously. And this one citizen that I know of - he's gone on television to say that he has formally asked a prosecutor to indict me on all kinds of crimes. SHAPIRO: Why do you think this is happening? What are the larger implications of these accusations? BARKEY: From the beginning, there was an attempt to essentially pin the blame on the United States. Partially it's the fact that in Turkey, everybody believes in conspiracy theories, and always those conspiracy theories are focused on the United States for a whole variety of reasons. I mean United States is the most powerful country in the world, and therefore it has the capability of doing these things presumably. Secondly, it's being used for domestic purposes. It's being used to mobilize people, to essentially put the blame on somebody else. And of course the fact that the Turks blame Fethullah Gulen, the self-exile cleric who happens to live in Pennsylvania now - the fact that he's here is convenient of course in completing the narrative. SHAPIRO: Why do you think Turkey would crack down on scholars and intellectuals specifically? BARKEY: Well, they're going after everybody they think is a follower of Fethullah Gulen. Now, it's sometimes hard to figure out who's a Fethullah Gulen follower and who is not. I mean they've closed universities which they thought were associated with Fethullah Gulen, so a lot of scholars there who may or may not have been associated with him, who just were, you know, just good, decent academics, lost their jobs. But they're also trying to crack down on other dissent. SHAPIRO: So you're saying this is a way of cracking down on free expression more generally. BARKEY: Yes, yes. SHAPIRO: How far do you think Turkey will go on this path? Do you expect that ultimately it will return to the country we knew before the coup attempt, or is this crackdown on free expression, these mass arrests the new normal for Turkey? BARKEY: I think Turkey has changed. I think there's been a significant change in Turkey, and there will not be a return to the old Turkey, whatever that was, anytime soon. That is to say you will see a constant pressure on dissent and especially constant pressure on what they think is a Gulen movement, which may be very extensive. But you will see purges continuing for many months and maybe many years to come.

This month, she wrote about her lengthy jailhouse interview with a German man who joined ISIS and lived in a training camp in Syria. She's interviewed women who were forced to become sex slaves for men in ISIS. She reported on how money from ransoms is one of the main sources of revenue for al-Qaida. In addition to her reporting on the ground, she follows ISIS's encrypted social media channels and communicates through social media with people on the fringes of the terror group. Before joining The New York Times, she was the AP's West Africa bureau chief. And in that job, back in 2013, she found thousands of pages of al-Qaida documents in a complex of buildings that served as the headquarters of the group's North Africa branch. She spent much of this summer reporting from Germany and France, which have been the target of terrorist attacks. Rukmini Callimachi, welcome back to FRESH AIR. So early on when ISIS was formed, a distinction that was often made between ISIS and al-Qaida was that al-Qaida was targeting the far enemy, the West - America, Europe - whereas ISIS wanted to focus on building a caliphate. And they wanted to wipe out their enemies in that region. But they weren't focusing on the West. Now we know that ISIS is targeting Europe and ISIS is targeting the U. S. Did their mission change or did the experts get it wrong? RUKMINI CALLIMACHI: I think the experts got it wrong. From the earliest days of the Islamic State as we know it today, they were sending fighters back to Europe. The earliest case that I could identify was a man called Ibrahim Putina who leaves ISIS-held territory in December of 2013 and is arrested in France with three TATP bombs in February of 2014. That's roughly six months before ISIS even declares a caliphate. I think what's happened is that we didn't notice these early returnees. And we didn't notice them because the majority of their plots were foiled. GROSS: You recently had an article based on your lengthy interview with Harry Sarfo, who was recruited into ISIS' special forces training camp in Syria. He is German. But he's also lived in London. We'll hear his British accent in a moment. I guess we're going to hear a clip of your interview. And you spoke to him in prison 'cause he's serving a three-year sentence for terrorism. . . CALLIMACHI: Right. Right. GROSS: . . . In Germany. So why did he want to join ISIS? CALLIMACHI: His story for joining ISIS is very similar to that of thousands of others. He had veered off-course in his life. He was involved in petty crime. He had recently gotten caught stealing money out of a safe from a supermarket in Germany and ended up having to spend a one-year sentence in jail. And in jail, he meets a hardcore Islamist who was serving a terrorism sentence. He becomes radicalized through this man. And when he comes out, he begins to think that Syria with the Islamic State - this black and white ideology - that this might provide the framework that he needs to basically stay out of trouble and lead what he thought would be a holy life. Of course, he goes to Syria. And within not much time, he realizes the grave error he had made. GROSS: So he was valuable to ISIS because of his German-London background. CALLIMACHI: Right. GROSS: And he told you that while he was in Syria, he was privy to ISIS's plans to launch attacks in Europe, and they proposed that he go back to Germany to recruit people to carry out attacks there on behalf of ISIS. Let's hear a little bit about what he told you about that. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)HARRY SARFO: Then one man approached me, said I heard you used to live in London, and I heard you were born in Germany. Do you have any contacts or any networks in Germany who are willing to give their life for the emir Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi? And I told him, no, I don't have no one. I'm not willing to go back at all. Then he said, especially in Germany and in England it's lacking of people who are willing to give their life. My friend asked him, so what about France? Because where they were asking about - England and Germany - that they don't have people who were ready to give their life, and then my friend asked him what about France? And they started laughing and really serious laughing with tears in their eyes, saying don't worry about France. (Speaking Arabic) in Arabic means no problem. France's - don't worry about France. France - we have enough people. CALLIMACHI: Wow. And that was probably in April. So five, six months. . . SARFO: Yeah. CALLIMACHI: . . . Before the November 13 attacks. SARFO: Exactly. CALLIMACHI: Interesting. GROSS: And the November 13 attacks were the attacks in Paris on the concert hall and other areas - you know, restaurants, the outside of the stadium around there. CALLIMACHI: Right. GROSS: And we just heard my guest Rukmini Callimachi who's a New York Times reporter who covers ISIS interviewing Harry Sarfo, a former ISIS recruit who's now serving a prison sentence in Germany. CALLIMACHI: Right. GROSS: Why do you think he's willing to talk? CALLIMACHI: What his lawyer and what he and what German intelligence have told me is they really believe that he's remorseful for what he's done, that he's in a way seen the error in the path he took, and they're hoping that he can become a counter-narrative, a voice from the inside that can warn others as to the realities on the ground if you join the Islamic State. GROSS: So Harry Sarfo told you that he was told by leaders of ISIS that they have lots of people in France. It's hard to get people to get into the United States. CALLIMACHI: Yes. GROSS: What did he tell you about the U. S. ? CALLIMACHI: So there's two obstacles to the U. S. One is that anybody that trains in Syria - and he said that they do have Americans training in Syria and also Americans inside the Emni - which is this body that is responsible for sending them back - but the first obstacle is obviously you have to go there by flight. You know, whether it's directly onto U. S. soil or through Canada or through Mexico, there's a flight involved, and it's a long-haul flight. And in general, the security checks there are more intensive than they are at small provincial airports in Europe. The second thing he said is that despite that obstacle meaning that it's hard for them to get fighters back, they have a great advantage in the U. S. which is, as he put it, the fact that our gun laws are, quote, \"dumb. \" He was quoting ISIS when he was saying this. And what he means is that it's much easier to get guns in America as we know than it is in Europe. In Europe, they're looking for fighters who have a criminal background. The reason they're doing that is they're hoping that that criminal background will allow them to be part of an underworld that makes it easier to get weapons because it's not easy to get weapons in Europe. GROSS: So they mention how dumb - literally dumb is the word he used. . . CALLIMACHI: Yes. GROSS: . . . Our gun laws are. . . CALLIMACHI: Right. GROSS: . . . Because it lets people get weapons. CALLIMACHI: Yes. GROSS: What did you learn about the training process in Syria for ISIS fighters from Harry Sarfo? CALLIMACHI: It varies greatly. So on the one hand, there's a network of dormitories just across the border from Turkey and Syria where they house new recruits as soon as they arrive. And in those dormitories, they triage them. They do a lengthy intake interview with each one where they're asking them all sorts of questions about their backgrounds. A doctor comes and gives them a physical, draws blood, takes their fingerprints. And in that initial intake interview, they identify the ones that they want to send back right away. When the Emni - which is this body - comes and gets them, we've seen that the training can be as little as a couple of days, which is the case for Reda Hame who was sent back in July of last year, or a couple of weeks. And it's rare that it goes beyond that. The reason for that is ISIS - when they're recruiting fighters from the West, from Europe etc. , they give them instructions that when they're coming to Syria. They need to try to make it look like a holiday, so they teach them to book a return ticket. They teach them to go ahead and pay for an all-expensive, one-week vacation at a resort on the Turkish coast. And the note - the idea is to make it look like they're, you know - they're there just having a fun time. And if they go to Syria for more than a couple of weeks, it becomes harder to justify the so-called vacation when they're returning through European checkpoints. Harry is approached as soon as he arrives. He was very much a desirable target for them, given his German passport and his experience living in London - two countries that they're still trying to infiltrate. And they ask him if he wants to be a suicide bomber right away in Germany. He says no. At that point, they then funnel him to ISIS's special forces, which is this very grueling training program - 10 levels. He makes it through part of the first level when they come to him again and say, would you like to go? He again turns them down. He goes to the second level. He's again approached. So my impression - I mean, again, this is single source. It's his experience. But my impression is that if you have the chops - meaning the passport, the criminal background, et cetera - to be one of the people that they would like to send back, they aggressively recruit you throughout the process that you're in Syria. And the training is not that important. And I think the reason for that is that they've realized that with an automatic weapon, you can cause a lot of harm even if you're not, you know, a trained commando. GROSS: I should mention here that an excerpt of the interview you did with him is online on The New York Times website. . . CALLIMACHI: Right. GROSS: . . . If anybody wants to actually see him 'cause his face is on camera. CALLIMACHI: Right. GROSS: So one of the things he told you was that he was exposed to atrocities. He witnessed atrocities. . . CALLIMACHI: Yes. GROSS: . . . Including a beheading, which just sickened him. CALLIMACHI: Right. GROSS: And he was trying to withdraw. It was hard to do. They became suspicious of him. And then one day, he was asked to make a video. There were hostages who were tied up. And he explains to you that he didn't really want to do the things that they were asking him to do. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)SARFO: Abousamra arrived with seven Syrians. He said, what? I said, soldiers of Assad. Their hands were tied and the eyes were as well-clothed. They couldn't see nothing. And then he started asking, who wants to execute them? And everybody was raising their hands. I didn't raise my hand. CALLIMACHI: I mean, it seems to me that many times along the way, you said no. SARFO: Yeah. CALLIMACHI: You said no when they asked you to go back as a suicide bomber. SARFO: Yeah. CALLIMACHI: You said no a second time when they asked you a second time. You didn't take the gun. SARFO: Yeah. CALLIMACHI: They weren't getting suspicious of you? SARFO: Yeah, they were. When I said, I don't want to take part in the execution, they were all looking at me. And they were asking me, why are you here then? CALLIMACHI: Right. SARFO: And then they said, OK. Obviously then - but you have to take the black flag in the video. (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO)SARFO: And how can I say this? You're black. You're German. It's going to be a good look for the video if a black man carries the black flag. And obviously, I said yes to the lesser - 'cause it was less worse than killing a person. GROSS: And you saw the video that Harry Sarfo's in, carrying the black ISIS flag. CALLIMACHI: I saw the video last year when it came out. That's one of the things that's so incredible about meeting him now. The video was put out through ISIS's, you know, regular propaganda channels. And it's a video of only German fighters. So they're speaking in German. And at the bottom, they have Arabic subtitles. And it's aimed at recruiting people from Germany. And I remember looking at it. Everybody in - all of the other Germans that are in the cast, as one could say, are white. And he stands out because he's a black man. And he's the one who's holding the flag. That's one of the most incredible things to me - is that, you know, so often, Terry, when you're working on this beat, you'll talk to extremists. You'll talk to people who are on the edges of the group or who claim to be in the group. And oftentimes, you might have a general gut sense that they're telling you the truth. But it becomes almost impossible to say with certainty. And here's a case where Harry is willing to be photographed, videotaped. He's showing his face. He's letting his real name be used. And his belonging to this group is not in question because we see him in one of their premier propaganda productions that they released last year. GROSS: I think it's so interesting that he says that the ISIS leaders making the video say, you should carry the black flag 'cause you're black. . . CALLIMACHI: Right. GROSS: . . . And it would be a good look. CALLIMACHI: A good look - right, right. GROSS: They have such a sense of media and how to manipulate the images. CALLIMACHI: Absolutely. Absolutely. And I think what he's getting at is there have been accusations that ISIS, because of their leadership being Arab - that they're racist. And it just so happens that Harry is black. And one other member of ISIS that I was speaking to last year was African-American. He was a U. S. citizen. And they've both gone to lengths to sort of prove to me that ISIS was not racist - you know, that they were fully integrated into the ranks of this group. GROSS: Well, I think we need to take a short break here. Let me reintroduce you. My guest is Rukmini Callimachi. She is a reporter for The New York Times who covers ISIS. So we're going to take a short break and then talk more about ISIS. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is Rukmini Callimachi. She covers ISIS for The New York Times. And she's been doing some extraordinary reporting, including a recent interview in a German prison with a German who spent time in a Syrian training camp, an ISIS training camp, and then decided he really didn't want to be a part of it. He's spending three years in a German prison but is telling his story. So Harry Sarfo was radicalized in prison, where he was doing time. . . CALLIMACHI: Yes. GROSS: . . . For a petty crime. CALLIMACHI: Right. GROSS: Was he from a Muslim background? Was he already Muslim? CALLIMACHI: No, he was a Christian kid. His parents are from Ghana. He grew up partly in Germany, partly in London. He says he converted to Islam in London, but he was going to a moderate mosque. And his real radicalization began in jail, which is a very common story. We're hearing many of the November 13 attackers and the Charlie Hebdo attackers went through this particular trajectory where they become Muslims in a casual sense. And then the hard-line ideology is something that they become inoculated with in prison. GROSS: So what was Sarfo expecting when he joined ISIS? I mean, I think everybody knows that they. . . CALLIMACHI: Right. GROSS: They behead people. They execute. . . CALLIMACHI: Right. GROSS: . . . People. They force people - they commit genocide of minority. . . CALLIMACHI: Yes. GROSS: . . . Groups. CALLIMACHI: Yes. GROSS: But why was he surprised that he was sickened when he witnessed a beheading? CALLIMACHI: Yeah. Well, the narrative that ISIS puts out is that they are a homeland for Muslims, that this is the only place in the world where a Muslim can feel safe. And by Muslims, they mean something very specific. They mean Sunni Muslims that are adhering to their brand of Salafi extreme Islam. He talks about during the execution scene that happens in that video that he was part of one of the moments of great disillusionment for him came when they brought out the captives, they're kneeling down to be killed. And the other Germans who were in the film are saying to the camera that these are Assad's soldiers. These are soldiers from the regime of Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad, that they opened fire on the Islamic State, et cetera. And they had - they - at least one of them is wearing camouflage pants, you know, to make him look like a soldier. And as this man is kneeling, Harry says that he starts screaming and protesting and says I'm not a soldier. I've never been in any military. I'm just a Sunni Muslim. In fact, I'm the imam of such and such a mosque. And it was when he said those words that the guy pulled the trigger. And I asked Harry, do you think that man was telling the truth? And he said, yeah, I think he was. And so suddenly he realized that this wasn't a place that was a homeland for anybody. Even Sunni Muslims are being killed here. And to back up a little, Terry, one of the interesting, you know, wrinkles in Harry's narrative is that he gets radicalized in prison. He comes out and he starts going to an extremist mosque, and he goes pretty deeply into this ideology. But he actually pulls himself out before he goes to Syria. The reason he pulls himself out is it's at the point in time when they're making the point to him that he's now part of the Muslim ummah, the Muslim community, and that it was inappropriate for him to have any kind of ties with anybody who was not a good Muslim. So he's Christian - he grew up Christian, and most of his friends in Germany happen to be Christian. And so he explained to me how he remembered thinking that that was stupid, you know, like, this - that just doesn't make sense. Why should these guys who are his drinking buddies and the people that he's hung out with since childhood, why should they be considered the enemy? And he talks about how he pulled away, and he tried to pull out of the group. But unfortunately, because he'd been going to this well-known radical mosque, at that point he was already in the database of German intelligence. And German police began raiding his apartment. The police would come; they'd kick down the door. It would be incredibly embarrassing. You know, the neighbors would see this kind of fuss. And at that point, the people from the mosque came back to him and said, see? They hate you because you're a Muslim. You're not safe here. This is a country where you will never be able to live in peace as a Muslim. And at that point, in his frustration at how the police were treating him, he basically went headlong back into the group thinking, this is a place where as a Sunni Muslim I'm going to be safe, I'm going to be valued. I'm going to be part of this caliphate-building project. And he realizes during the recording of that execution, which happens on camera - I mean, that video is out there, Terry - he realizes that even that promise was empty. GROSS: Why was Harry Sarfo just given a three-year sentence? Why isn't the sentence longer? CALLIMACHI: (Laughter) Yes, that's a really good question. And I think that that goes to the heart of how different our legal systems are. You'd imagine that in America, somebody like him would spend considerably more in jail. In Europe, they just - the laws are just very different. The sentencing guidelines are drastically shorter. And some European countries, it's only recently that they've added laws dealing with the law that we call material support to terrorism, which is what Harry is being charged with. He provided material support to a terrorist organization. He never killed anybody, according to his own testimony. But, yeah, it is a bit startling to think that somebody trained by ISIS's special forces is going to be free and - in two years because he's already done one year in jail. GROSS: My guest is Rukmini Callimachi, who covers ISIS and al-Qaida for The New York Times. After we take a short break, she'll talk about interviewing women who have been forced to serve as sex slaves for ISIS. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. We're talking about ISIS with Rukmini Callimachi, who covers ISIS and al-Qaida for The New York Times. She's made several recent trips to Europe to report on ISIS. This month, she wrote an article based on her jailhouse interview with a German man who joined ISIS and was trained in Syria before becoming disillusioned. So there have been - what? - three recent attacks in Germany. And, like, can you - do you know if those are attributed to ISIS and how seriously we can take the attribution? CALLIMACHI: So there have been two. There have been two recent ISIS attacks. One was on a train in the small town of Wurzburg, Germany where an immigrant, a young man, he was 17 years old, began stabbing passengers on the train. He left behind a video pledging allegiance to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of the Islamic State, which was uploaded on the Amaq News Agency. That's ISIS' premier propaganda channel. And he left that before he carried out his act showing that at a minimum, there was a digital connection to ISIS before he carried out the violence. The second was in Ansbach, Germany, another small town, a man with a backpack went to an area outside of an open-air concert. We think that something went wrong because he ended up - the backpack bomb exploded. It killed only him. And it's possible that it exploded before he intended it to because there were no casualties. Same thing, he too left a video that was - that police found on his phone and that in the hours after the attack, was uploaded on the Amaq New Agency, again, pledging allegiance using this formal religious language that we have seen in numerous videos now showing a kind of template for how to pledge allegiance to the Islamic State. GROSS: So ISIS actually has a template showing how to pledge allegiance. So if you want to just do something at home and you've had no contact with any ISIS members, you know what the process is of pledging your allegiance to ISIS. CALLIMACHI: It seems that there is. And the rule is as follows, you need to pledge allegiance to the leader of the Islamic State, to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. It's not enough to just pledge allegiance to the group, though some have. The reason for this, I've been told, is it goes back to the hadiths and to stories of the Prophet Muhammad that he required a personal allegiance from his followers. When they pledge allegiance to Baghdadi, they don't just call him Baghdadi. They use his formal long name, which is Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi al-Qurashi al-Husseini. The name al-Qurashi is important. That's the tribe from which the Prophet Muhammad came. And so we believe that in using this longer name, it's a way to essentially bow down to the alleged lineage of this man who claims that he derives his ascendancy from the Prophet Muhammad. GROSS: So ISIS is really encouraging individuals to take violent action and attribute it to ISIS and pledge their allegiance. In 2014, the ISIS spokesperson Muhammad al-Adnani wrote if you are not able to find an IED or a bullet, then single out the disbelieving American, Frenchmen or any of their allies. Smash his head with a rock or slaughter him with a knife or run him over with your car or throw him down from a high place or choke him or poison him. Do not lack. Do not be contemptible. Let your slogan be may I not be saved if the cross worshipper and taghut patron, which means ruler ruling by man-made laws, survives. If you are unable to do so, then burn his home, car or business. So what is your understanding about why ISIS took on this strategy when it did and how effective it's been? CALLIMACHI: The lone wolf strategy is something that ISIS is borrowing from al-Qaida. What is unique about ISIS is they've taken this idea and because of their savoir faire in propaganda, because of their cutting edge social media strategy and their ability to create these propaganda films that truly energize their base, they've been able to inspire a much larger public to carry out these attacks. The question for me that remains is it's clear that once somebody has pledged allegiance to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and especially when they use kind of this formal language and these long honorifics for him, it's clear that they've been steeped in the propaganda. So there's at least that level of connection. There's a second level of connection that I'm trying to understand right now, which is that in the last, I would say, six or so months, we're seeing that when people pledge allegiance to the Islamic State, they're also able to get those pledges via video, via a print statement or photographs. They're able to find a means to get them uploaded to Amaq News Agency, which is ISIS's premier propaganda channel. What we don't yet know is are these fighters directly in contact with Amaq, which means at that point, to me, it almost becomes an ISIS-directed attack because if you're in touch with Amaq, which is their premier propaganda channel, you're really in touch with ISIS' core. Or is there something else happening? Is there an intermediary? Are they passing this video to an intermediary who is then passing it to Amaq directly or through a series of intermediaries? And that, to me, is the next question because that will explain the level of connective tissue between these attacks and the terror group. GROSS: Do you ever wonder if some of the people who commit violent acts are, you know, like, mentally ill and on the verge of violence? And they want to find a larger cause to latch onto. . . CALLIMACHI: Sure. GROSS: . . . And they want to get more attention for what they're doing. They want to be in the media. They don't want to just be dismissed as, like, a killer or, you know, a mass murderer. They want to be attached to a cause and to be glorified by somebody somewhere. CALLIMACHI: Right. GROSS: Therefore, ISIS is an easy way to go in the sense you know if you pledge allegiance to ISIS, you're ISIS. Do you think that there are cases like that, I mean, 'cause it seems to me like that would be qualitatively a little bit different than somebody who truly was radicalized and truly was in touch with ISIS. CALLIMACHI: I think that the majority of - from what I can tell, the majority of the cases include young men that at some level, have, when you start digging into their case, have some degree of mental illness. I mean, it goes without saying that if you're going to go into a nightclub in Florida and open fire with automatic weapons on innocent people that you're not well mentally. But from ISIS' perspective, that's OK. And that's the same as - the fact that somebody is mentally unwell, the fact that somebody has some other grievance and yet has taken on their mantle versus the guy who has been radicalized, you know, since birth and carries it out, they're all equal because the purpose of this group is to spread terror, to spread it all over the world, to make the kafir, the infidel, which is us, feel as if they're not safe anywhere, that somebody could pop out of a train and stab you, that you could be at a Fourth of July parade and suddenly somebody's going to use their SUV to mow you down, that's their end goal. And so in the end, the individual motivations of the people doesn't really matter because they are succeeding in propagating that notion of terror. GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is Rukmini Callimachi. She covers ISIS for The New York Times. We're going to take a short break. And when we come back, we're going to talk about her story on ISIS' sex slaves. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And I'm back with my guest Rukmini Callimachi, who covers ISIS and al-Qaida for The New York Times. So you've done a couple of remarkable stories about these sex slaves, the women that ISIS has taken and turn them into their sex slaves. And this year, you wrote about how these women are forced to use contraceptives. And you tried to find out the reason why. Like, why would ISIS care? Tell us the reason that you discovered. CALLIMACHI: Well, I had made multiple trips to Iraq last year to work on the first story that I did on ISIS' system of sexual slavery. And I wanted to understand the theological underpinnings of this because all of the women were telling me that the fighters would say to them, the hadiths in the Quran give us the right to do this to you. And I wanted to know if that was true. So I ended up reaching out to a Muslim scholar, Professor Kecia Ali, who's at Boston University and who has written books on this and a chapter in the Oxford Encyclopedia regarding slavery in Islam. And the first question she asked me was are they checking if the women are pregnant because if they're not checking, meaning what - so the women are bought by one of these fighters. When he tires of her after abusing her for some time, she is sold to another fighter and so on. And some of the victims, these poor people, have been sold 15 or more times. And you can imagine that at every step along the way, they're being raped. So she asked me, are they checking for pregnancy between the sales? And I didn't have an answer. I didn't know. So Professor Ali then pointed me to the hadiths. And this is the words and deeds of the Prophet Muhammad that talked about the importance of ascertaining paternity. That seemed to be just about the only right that a slave in this reading of scripture has, the right to know who the father of her child is. And so in antiquity, according to these laws that are put out in these texts on Islamic jurisprudence, a fighter who - an owner who buys a new slave is supposed to wait basically one moon, so one month to determine whether she's pregnant or not, to see whether she has her period, right? And so I ended up going back to Iraq to see if I could answer this question because it was fascinating to me. And in my early interviews, a lot of the women had told me that they were forced to take pills. And I had, you know, I had sort of jotted that down in my notebook. But I hadn't really digested it. And so I went back to Iraq to the Kurdish areas around the city of Dahuk. And I went to the camps with my fixer. And we went back to the women that I had already interviewed the first time. And then I went to seek out others. And what was, I mean, what was shocking was the extent to which they were aggressively pushing contraception. Some women were forced to take tablets, others were given the Depo-Provera injection. This is an injection that makes it so that you don't get pregnant for up to three months. And others were taken for ultrasounds in between the sales. At the same time, there were numerous violations. So there were numerous - there were women who tell me that they were with fighters one through three and fighters one through three gave them birth control and then tested for pregnancy. And then they'd go to fighter number four and five and those guys didn't check. So it was not uniform. There were people who were violating it. But the fact that they were mostly applying it, there's something quite sickening to me about it. There's something so calculated about essentially treating these women like an object that would become damaged if it became pregnant. Everything else you do to it is OK, but that's the one thing that needs to be avoided. GROSS: Did the women know that they were being given birth control? Did they know what the pills were? CALLIMACHI: Initially, some of them said that - some of these girls were so young. They're 16, 17 and younger. And one of them that I interviewed, who I think is in the lead of my story, she talks about how he came and he gave her this packet of pills. And it had three lines of white pills and then one line of red pills. And she didn't know what it was, you know? And he would come and berate her every day and watch her put the pill under her tongue. And then it was, I think, another woman in the house who explained to her what it was for. The interesting thing is that this, of course, was the one aspect of their perverted theology that very much was in line with what the victims wanted. None of them wanted to get pregnant. So when they learned that the pills, the injections, the trips to the doctor, that that was to avoid pregnancy, they were onboard because they, of course, did not want to be carrying their rapist's child. GROSS: So the ISIS men who raped these women and used them as sex slaves, they believed that the Quran gave them justification to do it as long as the women didn't get pregnant? CALLIMACHI: Yes, yes. The Quran has about more than a dozen references to the phrase those your right hand possesses. And what scholars of Islam have explained to me is that phrase means a slave. And that phrase comes up in sections that deal with what are the licit forms of sexual intercourse that a man can have? So you can have sex with your wife. You can't have sex with anybody else except those your right hand possesses, right? Now, what scholars explain to me is that even though the Quran lays out slavery as one of the licit forms of sex with a woman, what ISIS has done is, of course, taken it to a different level. They're not just saying that it's licit. They're saying that it's holy. They're saying that because it was, in their eyes, practiced by the Prophet, Muhammad it is, therefore, a sacred duty to rape these poor women. And some of the most heartbreaking interviews I did were with women who described how the fighters would pray before they raped them. They would then rape them. They would go and take a shower, and then they'd come back and pray again because, to them, the act of the rape was - I don't know how else to put it - but almost like an act of communion. GROSS: Leaves me speechless. And the women who you interviewed who were used as sex slaves. . . CALLIMACHI: Yeah. GROSS: . . . They were mostly Yazidi women, members of a religious minority who. . . CALLIMACHI: Right. GROSS: . . . ISIS basically practiced genocide on. I mean, they. . . CALLIMACHI: Yes. GROSS: Yeah. CALLIMACHI: Yes. GROSS: So these were women who were taken while other Yazidis were being just, like, wiped out. CALLIMACHI: Right. The only women I've spoken to are Yazidi women. And it seems that ISIS singled out this particular ethnic group for this very crime. There have been a few anecdotal cases of Christian women being taken as sex slaves and a few anecdotal cases of Shia women being taken. And, of course, we know the terrible story of the American aid worker, Kayla Mueller, who was also taken in this manner. But those accounts are very much at the anecdotal level. There's very few of them, whereas with the Yazidis, it was a systematic, planned-out orchestrated thing that they did. They showed up on Sinjar Mountain on August 3 and 4 of 2014 with empty trucks, specifically to fill them with women and to take them back to use them in this underground sex trade. GROSS: And they're still doing this? I mean, they're still practicing. . . CALLIMACHI: They're still. . . GROSS: They're still, like, raping women and. . . CALLIMACHI: Absolutely, absolutely. There's about. . . GROSS: . . . And holding them hostage. . . CALLIMACHI: Yeah. There were. . . GROSS: . . . And in slavery. CALLIMACHI: Right. There were 5,000 - more than 5,000 Yazidi people that were taken by ISIS starting in August of 2014. And Yazidi community leaders and the U. N. say that there's around 3,000 that are still in captivity. That includes women, children and a handful of men who were allowed to live. But yes - and they - a lot of them have had, at some level, contact with their families because when you go to the camps in northern Iraq, a lot of the families are spending every ounce of their strength right now trying to come up with the ransoms to essentially pay the smugglers to get their girls out. So they know that they're alive. The girls will take the fighter's cell phone and run off to the bathroom and make a quick phone call or hide his phone and wait for him to leave the house and then call. And so there's contact. We know that they're - we know that many of them are still alive. And it's just absolutely gutting to think what's happening to them. GROSS: So the women who you interviewed, did they escape? Or were they released in return for ransom? CALLIMACHI: Almost all of the ones that I spoke to, what they would do is they would run away from the house of the man who was holding them. They would seek shelter in another civilian's house - Muslim, Kurdish, etc. In many cases, they would be handed back over to the abuser, and then terrible things would happen. But in the lucky instances, those people would then allow them to call their families. Their families are in touch with the smuggling network, and they're paying smugglers $5,000 - $6,000 - $10,000 per girl to get them out. There's been a big debate as to whether that money is a ransom or not. There are many cases, I think, where the money is purely going to the smugglers. There are also cases of girls that I interviewed where the fighters themselves tired of her and agreed to allow her to call her family and to negotiate a ransom for her direct release. GROSS: All right. It sounds like virtually all the sex slaves that ISIS has taken have been. . . CALLIMACHI: Yes. GROSS: . . . Yazidi women. GROSS: Why. . . CALLIMACHI: Yes. GROSS: . . . Are they Yazidi? CALLIMACHI: ISIS put out a pamphlet soon after they invaded Sinjar, which is the homeland of the Yazidi people explaining why, theologically, the Yazidi people were targeted for enslavement and why their enslavement is in their eyes legal. And it rests on the idea that the Yazidis are polytheists. The Yazidis actually believe in a single god. But underneath the single god, there are a number of sacred angels. It's not that different from Christianity, where you have Christ, God and, you know, the Holy Spirit. But anyway, because of this belief in these angels, they have determined that they're polytheists. And polytheists are the worst category, according to ISIS, that needs to - they need to be - the earth needs to be cleansed of them, in their eyes, in order to create the way for the monotheistic faith that they're trying to instill. And so they have essentially created a legal framework to do these horrific things to these young women. GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is Rukmini Callimachi who covers ISIS and al-Qaida for The New York Times. We're going to take a short break here. Then we'll be back. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is Rukmini Callimachi. She covers ISIS and al-Qaida for The New York Times. So your family is from Romania. CALLIMACHI: Yes. GROSS: And when you were 5, your family fled Romania, which was under the dictatorship of Nicolae Ceausescu. CALLIMACHI: Yes. GROSS: And officially, you weren't allowed to leave unless you pledged to come back. . . CALLIMACHI: Right. GROSS: . . . Because people weren't allowed to leave and not return. CALLIMACHI: Right. GROSS: So what you did in leaving was illegal. Had you been turned away by any of the countries that you went to afterwards? And had you been returned against your will to Romania, your mother or perhaps your mother and your grandmother would've been imprisoned. Fortunately, you found safe haven first in Switzerland and then, a few years later, in the United States. CALLIMACHI: Actually, the very first country we came to was Germany - Munich, strangely enough. And we stayed there not for very long. And then from there, Switzerland took us in. But as an - as a former refugee myself, it's actually been painful to write these stories about how ISIS is using the refugee flow to get into Europe. But as a reporter, of course, I can't turn my eyes away from it. They are using the refugee flow to get in. They are using the generosity of Germany, specifically, and Europe overall to infiltrate and carry out heinous acts. GROSS: How do you know that? CALLIMACHI: Well, we know that the November 13 attackers - 9 out of 10 of them slipped back into Europe from Syria. Of those nine, we know at least four that came on a refugee boat and were checked into the island of Theras (ph) in Greece. It's true that we don't know. . . GROSS: And you're talking about the attacks on Paris in November? CALLIMACHI: Yes, yes. Exactly. Exactly. The two guys who blew themselves up at the Stade de France - they were the first suicide bombers to carry out their attacks. They came on a refugee boat. We don't know how the others came through. But given that at least four of them came in this manner, I think it's logical to assume that the others may have, as well. And now in Germany, we're seeing - the Wuerzburg attacker was an immigrant, allegedly from Afghanistan, who was given refuge. And the Ansbach attacker was a Syrian refugee. So it doesn't - you know, even though these people are a tiny percentage of the tens of thousands of people that have come through, it does poison the water. And it does make it very difficult for leaders in Europe to deal with the policy of open borders in the face of what's happened. GROSS: Yeah. And you said it's hard for you to even write these stories because. . . CALLIMACHI: Yeah, I mean, I have. GROSS: . . . As a refugee yourself, you know. . . CALLIMACHI: Yeah. GROSS: . . . What drives somebody to face such danger - to leave. But at the same time. . . CALLIMACHI: I do. I do. GROSS: . . . You recognize that ISIS is using this as a way to get people in. CALLIMACHI: Yeah. And I find it so incomprehensible that when you're fleeing a place such as Syria - and, of course, Syria is so much worse than communist Romania ever was. You know, my family was at no point facing the peril that these families are facing. But I find it incomprehensible that you would abuse the generosity of the country that takes you in. I am forever grateful to both Germany and Switzerland for giving my family a chance and even more grateful to the United States for taking us in a couple of years later. If I hadn't, I would never be what I am today. GROSS: Rukmini Callimachi, thank you so much for talking with us. CALLIMACHI: It's my pleasure, Terry. I love to be on your show.

TERRY GROSS, HOST:  This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. It's very difficult to report on the inner workings of a terrorist group like ISIS. But my guest, Rukmini Callimachi, has been doing an extraordinary job covering ISIS and al-Qaida for The New York Times. This month, she wrote about her lengthy jailhouse interview with a German man who joined ISIS and lived in a training camp in Syria. She's interviewed women who were forced to become sex slaves for men in ISIS. She reported on how money from ransoms is one of the main sources of revenue for al-Qaida. In addition to her reporting on the ground, she follows ISIS's encrypted social media channels and communicates through social media with people on the fringes of the terror group. Before joining The New York Times, she was the AP's West Africa bureau chief. And in that job, back in 2013, she found thousands of pages of al-Qaida documents in a complex of buildings that served as the headquarters of the group's North Africa branch. She spent much of this summer reporting from Germany and France, which have been the target of terrorist attacks. Rukmini Callimachi, welcome back to FRESH AIR. So early on when ISIS was formed, a distinction that was often made between ISIS and al-Qaida was that al-Qaida was targeting the far enemy, the West - America, Europe - whereas ISIS wanted to focus on building a caliphate. And they wanted to wipe out their enemies in that region. But they weren't focusing on the West. Now we know that ISIS is targeting Europe and ISIS is targeting the U. S. Did their mission change or did the experts get it wrong? RUKMINI CALLIMACHI: I think the experts got it wrong. From the earliest days of the Islamic State as we know it today, they were sending fighters back to Europe. The earliest case that I could identify was a man called Ibrahim Putina who leaves ISIS-held territory in December of 2013 and is arrested in France with three TATP bombs in February of 2014. That's roughly six months before ISIS even declares a caliphate. I think what's happened is that we didn't notice these early returnees. And we didn't notice them because the majority of their plots were foiled. GROSS: You recently had an article based on your lengthy interview with Harry Sarfo, who was recruited into ISIS' special forces training camp in Syria. He is German. But he's also lived in London. We'll hear his British accent in a moment. I guess we're going to hear a clip of your interview. And you spoke to him in prison 'cause he's serving a three-year sentence for terrorism. . . CALLIMACHI: Right. Right. GROSS: . . . In Germany. So why did he want to join ISIS? CALLIMACHI: His story for joining ISIS is very similar to that of thousands of others. He had veered off-course in his life. He was involved in petty crime. He had recently gotten caught stealing money out of a safe from a supermarket in Germany and ended up having to spend a one-year sentence in jail. And in jail, he meets a hardcore Islamist who was serving a terrorism sentence. He becomes radicalized through this man. And when he comes out, he begins to think that Syria with the Islamic State - this black and white ideology - that this might provide the framework that he needs to basically stay out of trouble and lead what he thought would be a holy life. Of course, he goes to Syria. And within not much time, he realizes the grave error he had made. GROSS: So he was valuable to ISIS because of his German-London background. CALLIMACHI: Right. GROSS: And he told you that while he was in Syria, he was privy to ISIS's plans to launch attacks in Europe, and they proposed that he go back to Germany to recruit people to carry out attacks there on behalf of ISIS. Let's hear a little bit about what he told you about that. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) HARRY SARFO: Then one man approached me, said I heard you used to live in London, and I heard you were born in Germany. Do you have any contacts or any networks in Germany who are willing to give their life for the emir Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi? And I told him, no, I don't have no one. I'm not willing to go back at all. Then he said, especially in Germany and in England it's lacking of people who are willing to give their life. My friend asked him, so what about France? Because where they were asking about - England and Germany - that they don't have people who were ready to give their life, and then my friend asked him what about France? And they started laughing and really serious laughing with tears in their eyes, saying don't worry about France. (Speaking Arabic) in Arabic means no problem. France's - don't worry about France. France - we have enough people. CALLIMACHI: Wow. And that was probably in April. So five, six months. . . SARFO: Yeah. CALLIMACHI: . . . Before the November 13 attacks. SARFO: Exactly. CALLIMACHI: Interesting. GROSS: And the November 13 attacks were the attacks in Paris on the concert hall and other areas - you know, restaurants, the outside of the stadium around there. CALLIMACHI: Right. GROSS: And we just heard my guest Rukmini Callimachi who's a New York Times reporter who covers ISIS interviewing Harry Sarfo, a former ISIS recruit who's now serving a prison sentence in Germany. CALLIMACHI: Right. GROSS: Why do you think he's willing to talk? CALLIMACHI: What his lawyer and what he and what German intelligence have told me is they really believe that he's remorseful for what he's done, that he's in a way seen the error in the path he took, and they're hoping that he can become a counter-narrative, a voice from the inside that can warn others as to the realities on the ground if you join the Islamic State. GROSS: So Harry Sarfo told you that he was told by leaders of ISIS that they have lots of people in France. It's hard to get people to get into the United States. CALLIMACHI: Yes. GROSS: What did he tell you about the U. S. ? CALLIMACHI: So there's two obstacles to the U. S. One is that anybody that trains in Syria - and he said that they do have Americans training in Syria and also Americans inside the Emni - which is this body that is responsible for sending them back - but the first obstacle is obviously you have to go there by flight. You know, whether it's directly onto U. S. soil or through Canada or through Mexico, there's a flight involved, and it's a long-haul flight. And in general, the security checks there are more intensive than they are at small provincial airports in Europe. The second thing he said is that despite that obstacle meaning that it's hard for them to get fighters back, they have a great advantage in the U. S. which is, as he put it, the fact that our gun laws are, quote, \"dumb. \" He was quoting ISIS when he was saying this. And what he means is that it's much easier to get guns in America as we know than it is in Europe. In Europe, they're looking for fighters who have a criminal background. The reason they're doing that is they're hoping that that criminal background will allow them to be part of an underworld that makes it easier to get weapons because it's not easy to get weapons in Europe. GROSS: So they mention how dumb - literally dumb is the word he used. . . CALLIMACHI: Yes. GROSS: . . . Our gun laws are. . . CALLIMACHI: Right. GROSS: . . . Because it lets people get weapons. CALLIMACHI: Yes. GROSS: What did you learn about the training process in Syria for ISIS fighters from Harry Sarfo? CALLIMACHI: It varies greatly. So on the one hand, there's a network of dormitories just across the border from Turkey and Syria where they house new recruits as soon as they arrive. And in those dormitories, they triage them. They do a lengthy intake interview with each one where they're asking them all sorts of questions about their backgrounds. A doctor comes and gives them a physical, draws blood, takes their fingerprints. And in that initial intake interview, they identify the ones that they want to send back right away. When the Emni - which is this body - comes and gets them, we've seen that the training can be as little as a couple of days, which is the case for Reda Hame who was sent back in July of last year, or a couple of weeks. And it's rare that it goes beyond that. The reason for that is ISIS - when they're recruiting fighters from the West, from Europe etc. , they give them instructions that when they're coming to Syria. They need to try to make it look like a holiday, so they teach them to book a return ticket. They teach them to go ahead and pay for an all-expensive, one-week vacation at a resort on the Turkish coast. And the note - the idea is to make it look like they're, you know - they're there just having a fun time. And if they go to Syria for more than a couple of weeks, it becomes harder to justify the so-called vacation when they're returning through European checkpoints. Harry is approached as soon as he arrives. He was very much a desirable target for them, given his German passport and his experience living in London - two countries that they're still trying to infiltrate. And they ask him if he wants to be a suicide bomber right away in Germany. He says no. At that point, they then funnel him to ISIS's special forces, which is this very grueling training program - 10 levels. He makes it through part of the first level when they come to him again and say, would you like to go? He again turns them down. He goes to the second level. He's again approached. So my impression - I mean, again, this is single source. It's his experience. But my impression is that if you have the chops - meaning the passport, the criminal background, et cetera - to be one of the people that they would like to send back, they aggressively recruit you throughout the process that you're in Syria. And the training is not that important. And I think the reason for that is that they've realized that with an automatic weapon, you can cause a lot of harm even if you're not, you know, a trained commando. GROSS: I should mention here that an excerpt of the interview you did with him is online on The New York Times website. . . CALLIMACHI: Right. GROSS: . . . If anybody wants to actually see him 'cause his face is on camera. CALLIMACHI: Right. GROSS: So one of the things he told you was that he was exposed to atrocities. He witnessed atrocities. . . CALLIMACHI: Yes. GROSS: . . . Including a beheading, which just sickened him. CALLIMACHI: Right. GROSS: And he was trying to withdraw. It was hard to do. They became suspicious of him. And then one day, he was asked to make a video. There were hostages who were tied up. And he explains to you that he didn't really want to do the things that they were asking him to do. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) SARFO: Abousamra arrived with seven Syrians. He said, what? I said, soldiers of Assad. Their hands were tied and the eyes were as well-clothed. They couldn't see nothing. And then he started asking, who wants to execute them? And everybody was raising their hands. I didn't raise my hand. CALLIMACHI: I mean, it seems to me that many times along the way, you said no. SARFO: Yeah. CALLIMACHI: You said no when they asked you to go back as a suicide bomber. SARFO: Yeah. CALLIMACHI: You said no a second time when they asked you a second time. You didn't take the gun. SARFO: Yeah. CALLIMACHI: They weren't getting suspicious of you? SARFO: Yeah, they were. When I said, I don't want to take part in the execution, they were all looking at me. And they were asking me, why are you here then? CALLIMACHI: Right. SARFO: And then they said, OK. Obviously then - but you have to take the black flag in the video. (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO) SARFO: And how can I say this? You're black. You're German. It's going to be a good look for the video if a black man carries the black flag. And obviously, I said yes to the lesser - 'cause it was less worse than killing a person. GROSS: And you saw the video that Harry Sarfo's in, carrying the black ISIS flag. CALLIMACHI: I saw the video last year when it came out. That's one of the things that's so incredible about meeting him now. The video was put out through ISIS's, you know, regular propaganda channels. And it's a video of only German fighters. So they're speaking in German. And at the bottom, they have Arabic subtitles. And it's aimed at recruiting people from Germany. And I remember looking at it. Everybody in - all of the other Germans that are in the cast, as one could say, are white. And he stands out because he's a black man. And he's the one who's holding the flag. That's one of the most incredible things to me - is that, you know, so often, Terry, when you're working on this beat, you'll talk to extremists. You'll talk to people who are on the edges of the group or who claim to be in the group. And oftentimes, you might have a general gut sense that they're telling you the truth. But it becomes almost impossible to say with certainty. And here's a case where Harry is willing to be photographed, videotaped. He's showing his face. He's letting his real name be used. And his belonging to this group is not in question because we see him in one of their premier propaganda productions that they released last year. GROSS: I think it's so interesting that he says that the ISIS leaders making the video say, you should carry the black flag 'cause you're black. . . CALLIMACHI: Right. GROSS: . . . And it would be a good look. CALLIMACHI: A good look - right, right. GROSS: They have such a sense of media and how to manipulate the images. CALLIMACHI: Absolutely. Absolutely. And I think what he's getting at is there have been accusations that ISIS, because of their leadership being Arab - that they're racist. And it just so happens that Harry is black. And one other member of ISIS that I was speaking to last year was African-American. He was a U. S. citizen. And they've both gone to lengths to sort of prove to me that ISIS was not racist - you know, that they were fully integrated into the ranks of this group. GROSS: Well, I think we need to take a short break here. Let me reintroduce you. My guest is Rukmini Callimachi. She is a reporter for The New York Times who covers ISIS. So we're going to take a short break and then talk more about ISIS. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is Rukmini Callimachi. She covers ISIS for The New York Times. And she's been doing some extraordinary reporting, including a recent interview in a German prison with a German who spent time in a Syrian training camp, an ISIS training camp, and then decided he really didn't want to be a part of it. He's spending three years in a German prison but is telling his story. So Harry Sarfo was radicalized in prison, where he was doing time. . . CALLIMACHI: Yes. GROSS: . . . For a petty crime. CALLIMACHI: Right. GROSS: Was he from a Muslim background? Was he already Muslim? CALLIMACHI: No, he was a Christian kid. His parents are from Ghana. He grew up partly in Germany, partly in London. He says he converted to Islam in London, but he was going to a moderate mosque. And his real radicalization began in jail, which is a very common story. We're hearing many of the November 13 attackers and the Charlie Hebdo attackers went through this particular trajectory where they become Muslims in a casual sense. And then the hard-line ideology is something that they become inoculated with in prison. GROSS: So what was Sarfo expecting when he joined ISIS? I mean, I think everybody knows that they. . . CALLIMACHI: Right. GROSS: They behead people. They execute. . . CALLIMACHI: Right. GROSS: . . . People. They force people - they commit genocide of minority. . . CALLIMACHI: Yes. GROSS: . . . Groups. CALLIMACHI: Yes. GROSS: But why was he surprised that he was sickened when he witnessed a beheading? CALLIMACHI: Yeah. Well, the narrative that ISIS puts out is that they are a homeland for Muslims, that this is the only place in the world where a Muslim can feel safe. And by Muslims, they mean something very specific. They mean Sunni Muslims that are adhering to their brand of Salafi extreme Islam. He talks about during the execution scene that happens in that video that he was part of one of the moments of great disillusionment for him came when they brought out the captives, they're kneeling down to be killed. And the other Germans who were in the film are saying to the camera that these are Assad's soldiers. These are soldiers from the regime of Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad, that they opened fire on the Islamic State, et cetera. And they had - they - at least one of them is wearing camouflage pants, you know, to make him look like a soldier. And as this man is kneeling, Harry says that he starts screaming and protesting and says I'm not a soldier. I've never been in any military. I'm just a Sunni Muslim. In fact, I'm the imam of such and such a mosque. And it was when he said those words that the guy pulled the trigger. And I asked Harry, do you think that man was telling the truth? And he said, yeah, I think he was. And so suddenly he realized that this wasn't a place that was a homeland for anybody. Even Sunni Muslims are being killed here. And to back up a little, Terry, one of the interesting, you know, wrinkles in Harry's narrative is that he gets radicalized in prison. He comes out and he starts going to an extremist mosque, and he goes pretty deeply into this ideology. But he actually pulls himself out before he goes to Syria. The reason he pulls himself out is it's at the point in time when they're making the point to him that he's now part of the Muslim ummah, the Muslim community, and that it was inappropriate for him to have any kind of ties with anybody who was not a good Muslim. So he's Christian - he grew up Christian, and most of his friends in Germany happen to be Christian. And so he explained to me how he remembered thinking that that was stupid, you know, like, this - that just doesn't make sense. Why should these guys who are his drinking buddies and the people that he's hung out with since childhood, why should they be considered the enemy? And he talks about how he pulled away, and he tried to pull out of the group. But unfortunately, because he'd been going to this well-known radical mosque, at that point he was already in the database of German intelligence. And German police began raiding his apartment. The police would come; they'd kick down the door. It would be incredibly embarrassing. You know, the neighbors would see this kind of fuss. And at that point, the people from the mosque came back to him and said, see? They hate you because you're a Muslim. You're not safe here. This is a country where you will never be able to live in peace as a Muslim. And at that point, in his frustration at how the police were treating him, he basically went headlong back into the group thinking, this is a place where as a Sunni Muslim I'm going to be safe, I'm going to be valued. I'm going to be part of this caliphate-building project. And he realizes during the recording of that execution, which happens on camera - I mean, that video is out there, Terry - he realizes that even that promise was empty. GROSS: Why was Harry Sarfo just given a three-year sentence? Why isn't the sentence longer? CALLIMACHI: (Laughter) Yes, that's a really good question. And I think that that goes to the heart of how different our legal systems are. You'd imagine that in America, somebody like him would spend considerably more in jail. In Europe, they just - the laws are just very different. The sentencing guidelines are drastically shorter. And some European countries, it's only recently that they've added laws dealing with the law that we call material support to terrorism, which is what Harry is being charged with. He provided material support to a terrorist organization. He never killed anybody, according to his own testimony. But, yeah, it is a bit startling to think that somebody trained by ISIS's special forces is going to be free and - in two years because he's already done one year in jail. GROSS: My guest is Rukmini Callimachi, who covers ISIS and al-Qaida for The New York Times. After we take a short break, she'll talk about interviewing women who have been forced to serve as sex slaves for ISIS. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. We're talking about ISIS with Rukmini Callimachi, who covers ISIS and al-Qaida for The New York Times. She's made several recent trips to Europe to report on ISIS. This month, she wrote an article based on her jailhouse interview with a German man who joined ISIS and was trained in Syria before becoming disillusioned. So there have been - what? - three recent attacks in Germany. And, like, can you - do you know if those are attributed to ISIS and how seriously we can take the attribution? CALLIMACHI: So there have been two. There have been two recent ISIS attacks. One was on a train in the small town of Wurzburg, Germany where an immigrant, a young man, he was 17 years old, began stabbing passengers on the train. He left behind a video pledging allegiance to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of the Islamic State, which was uploaded on the Amaq News Agency. That's ISIS' premier propaganda channel. And he left that before he carried out his act showing that at a minimum, there was a digital connection to ISIS before he carried out the violence. The second was in Ansbach, Germany, another small town, a man with a backpack went to an area outside of an open-air concert. We think that something went wrong because he ended up - the backpack bomb exploded. It killed only him. And it's possible that it exploded before he intended it to because there were no casualties. Same thing, he too left a video that was - that police found on his phone and that in the hours after the attack, was uploaded on the Amaq New Agency, again, pledging allegiance using this formal religious language that we have seen in numerous videos now showing a kind of template for how to pledge allegiance to the Islamic State. GROSS: So ISIS actually has a template showing how to pledge allegiance. So if you want to just do something at home and you've had no contact with any ISIS members, you know what the process is of pledging your allegiance to ISIS. CALLIMACHI: It seems that there is. And the rule is as follows, you need to pledge allegiance to the leader of the Islamic State, to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. It's not enough to just pledge allegiance to the group, though some have. The reason for this, I've been told, is it goes back to the hadiths and to stories of the Prophet Muhammad that he required a personal allegiance from his followers. When they pledge allegiance to Baghdadi, they don't just call him Baghdadi. They use his formal long name, which is Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi al-Qurashi al-Husseini. The name al-Qurashi is important. That's the tribe from which the Prophet Muhammad came. And so we believe that in using this longer name, it's a way to essentially bow down to the alleged lineage of this man who claims that he derives his ascendancy from the Prophet Muhammad. GROSS: So ISIS is really encouraging individuals to take violent action and attribute it to ISIS and pledge their allegiance. In 2014, the ISIS spokesperson Muhammad al-Adnani wrote if you are not able to find an IED or a bullet, then single out the disbelieving American, Frenchmen or any of their allies. Smash his head with a rock or slaughter him with a knife or run him over with your car or throw him down from a high place or choke him or poison him. Do not lack. Do not be contemptible. Let your slogan be may I not be saved if the cross worshipper and taghut patron, which means ruler ruling by man-made laws, survives. If you are unable to do so, then burn his home, car or business. So what is your understanding about why ISIS took on this strategy when it did and how effective it's been? CALLIMACHI: The lone wolf strategy is something that ISIS is borrowing from al-Qaida. What is unique about ISIS is they've taken this idea and because of their savoir faire in propaganda, because of their cutting edge social media strategy and their ability to create these propaganda films that truly energize their base, they've been able to inspire a much larger public to carry out these attacks. The question for me that remains is it's clear that once somebody has pledged allegiance to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and especially when they use kind of this formal language and these long honorifics for him, it's clear that they've been steeped in the propaganda. So there's at least that level of connection. There's a second level of connection that I'm trying to understand right now, which is that in the last, I would say, six or so months, we're seeing that when people pledge allegiance to the Islamic State, they're also able to get those pledges via video, via a print statement or photographs. They're able to find a means to get them uploaded to Amaq News Agency, which is ISIS's premier propaganda channel. What we don't yet know is are these fighters directly in contact with Amaq, which means at that point, to me, it almost becomes an ISIS-directed attack because if you're in touch with Amaq, which is their premier propaganda channel, you're really in touch with ISIS' core. Or is there something else happening? Is there an intermediary? Are they passing this video to an intermediary who is then passing it to Amaq directly or through a series of intermediaries? And that, to me, is the next question because that will explain the level of connective tissue between these attacks and the terror group. GROSS: Do you ever wonder if some of the people who commit violent acts are, you know, like, mentally ill and on the verge of violence? And they want to find a larger cause to latch onto. . . CALLIMACHI: Sure. GROSS: . . . And they want to get more attention for what they're doing. They want to be in the media. They don't want to just be dismissed as, like, a killer or, you know, a mass murderer. They want to be attached to a cause and to be glorified by somebody somewhere. CALLIMACHI: Right. GROSS: Therefore, ISIS is an easy way to go in the sense you know if you pledge allegiance to ISIS, you're ISIS. Do you think that there are cases like that, I mean, 'cause it seems to me like that would be qualitatively a little bit different than somebody who truly was radicalized and truly was in touch with ISIS. CALLIMACHI: I think that the majority of - from what I can tell, the majority of the cases include young men that at some level, have, when you start digging into their case, have some degree of mental illness. I mean, it goes without saying that if you're going to go into a nightclub in Florida and open fire with automatic weapons on innocent people that you're not well mentally. But from ISIS' perspective, that's OK. And that's the same as - the fact that somebody is mentally unwell, the fact that somebody has some other grievance and yet has taken on their mantle versus the guy who has been radicalized, you know, since birth and carries it out, they're all equal because the purpose of this group is to spread terror, to spread it all over the world, to make the kafir, the infidel, which is us, feel as if they're not safe anywhere, that somebody could pop out of a train and stab you, that you could be at a Fourth of July parade and suddenly somebody's going to use their SUV to mow you down, that's their end goal. And so in the end, the individual motivations of the people doesn't really matter because they are succeeding in propagating that notion of terror. GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is Rukmini Callimachi. She covers ISIS for The New York Times. We're going to take a short break. And when we come back, we're going to talk about her story on ISIS' sex slaves. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And I'm back with my guest Rukmini Callimachi, who covers ISIS and al-Qaida for The New York Times. So you've done a couple of remarkable stories about these sex slaves, the women that ISIS has taken and turn them into their sex slaves. And this year, you wrote about how these women are forced to use contraceptives. And you tried to find out the reason why. Like, why would ISIS care? Tell us the reason that you discovered. CALLIMACHI: Well, I had made multiple trips to Iraq last year to work on the first story that I did on ISIS' system of sexual slavery. And I wanted to understand the theological underpinnings of this because all of the women were telling me that the fighters would say to them, the hadiths in the Quran give us the right to do this to you. And I wanted to know if that was true. So I ended up reaching out to a Muslim scholar, Professor Kecia Ali, who's at Boston University and who has written books on this and a chapter in the Oxford Encyclopedia regarding slavery in Islam. And the first question she asked me was are they checking if the women are pregnant because if they're not checking, meaning what - so the women are bought by one of these fighters. When he tires of her after abusing her for some time, she is sold to another fighter and so on. And some of the victims, these poor people, have been sold 15 or more times. And you can imagine that at every step along the way, they're being raped. So she asked me, are they checking for pregnancy between the sales? And I didn't have an answer. I didn't know. So Professor Ali then pointed me to the hadiths. And this is the words and deeds of the Prophet Muhammad that talked about the importance of ascertaining paternity. That seemed to be just about the only right that a slave in this reading of scripture has, the right to know who the father of her child is. And so in antiquity, according to these laws that are put out in these texts on Islamic jurisprudence, a fighter who - an owner who buys a new slave is supposed to wait basically one moon, so one month to determine whether she's pregnant or not, to see whether she has her period, right? And so I ended up going back to Iraq to see if I could answer this question because it was fascinating to me. And in my early interviews, a lot of the women had told me that they were forced to take pills. And I had, you know, I had sort of jotted that down in my notebook. But I hadn't really digested it. And so I went back to Iraq to the Kurdish areas around the city of Dahuk. And I went to the camps with my fixer. And we went back to the women that I had already interviewed the first time. And then I went to seek out others. And what was, I mean, what was shocking was the extent to which they were aggressively pushing contraception. Some women were forced to take tablets, others were given the Depo-Provera injection. This is an injection that makes it so that you don't get pregnant for up to three months. And others were taken for ultrasounds in between the sales. At the same time, there were numerous violations. So there were numerous - there were women who tell me that they were with fighters one through three and fighters one through three gave them birth control and then tested for pregnancy. And then they'd go to fighter number four and five and those guys didn't check. So it was not uniform. There were people who were violating it. But the fact that they were mostly applying it, there's something quite sickening to me about it. There's something so calculated about essentially treating these women like an object that would become damaged if it became pregnant. Everything else you do to it is OK, but that's the one thing that needs to be avoided. GROSS: Did the women know that they were being given birth control? Did they know what the pills were? CALLIMACHI: Initially, some of them said that - some of these girls were so young. They're 16, 17 and younger. And one of them that I interviewed, who I think is in the lead of my story, she talks about how he came and he gave her this packet of pills. And it had three lines of white pills and then one line of red pills. And she didn't know what it was, you know? And he would come and berate her every day and watch her put the pill under her tongue. And then it was, I think, another woman in the house who explained to her what it was for. The interesting thing is that this, of course, was the one aspect of their perverted theology that very much was in line with what the victims wanted. None of them wanted to get pregnant. So when they learned that the pills, the injections, the trips to the doctor, that that was to avoid pregnancy, they were onboard because they, of course, did not want to be carrying their rapist's child. GROSS: So the ISIS men who raped these women and used them as sex slaves, they believed that the Quran gave them justification to do it as long as the women didn't get pregnant? CALLIMACHI: Yes, yes. The Quran has about more than a dozen references to the phrase those your right hand possesses. And what scholars of Islam have explained to me is that phrase means a slave. And that phrase comes up in sections that deal with what are the licit forms of sexual intercourse that a man can have? So you can have sex with your wife. You can't have sex with anybody else except those your right hand possesses, right? Now, what scholars explain to me is that even though the Quran lays out slavery as one of the licit forms of sex with a woman, what ISIS has done is, of course, taken it to a different level. They're not just saying that it's licit. They're saying that it's holy. They're saying that because it was, in their eyes, practiced by the Prophet, Muhammad it is, therefore, a sacred duty to rape these poor women. And some of the most heartbreaking interviews I did were with women who described how the fighters would pray before they raped them. They would then rape them. They would go and take a shower, and then they'd come back and pray again because, to them, the act of the rape was - I don't know how else to put it - but almost like an act of communion. GROSS: Leaves me speechless. And the women who you interviewed who were used as sex slaves. . . CALLIMACHI: Yeah. GROSS: . . . They were mostly Yazidi women, members of a religious minority who. . . CALLIMACHI: Right. GROSS: . . . ISIS basically practiced genocide on. I mean, they. . . CALLIMACHI: Yes. GROSS: Yeah. CALLIMACHI: Yes. GROSS: So these were women who were taken while other Yazidis were being just, like, wiped out. CALLIMACHI: Right. The only women I've spoken to are Yazidi women. And it seems that ISIS singled out this particular ethnic group for this very crime. There have been a few anecdotal cases of Christian women being taken as sex slaves and a few anecdotal cases of Shia women being taken. And, of course, we know the terrible story of the American aid worker, Kayla Mueller, who was also taken in this manner. But those accounts are very much at the anecdotal level. There's very few of them, whereas with the Yazidis, it was a systematic, planned-out orchestrated thing that they did. They showed up on Sinjar Mountain on August 3 and 4 of 2014 with empty trucks, specifically to fill them with women and to take them back to use them in this underground sex trade. GROSS: And they're still doing this? I mean, they're still practicing. . . CALLIMACHI: They're still. . . GROSS: They're still, like, raping women and. . . CALLIMACHI: Absolutely, absolutely. There's about. . . GROSS: . . . And holding them hostage. . . CALLIMACHI: Yeah. There were. . . GROSS: . . . And in slavery. CALLIMACHI: Right. There were 5,000 - more than 5,000 Yazidi people that were taken by ISIS starting in August of 2014. And Yazidi community leaders and the U. N. say that there's around 3,000 that are still in captivity. That includes women, children and a handful of men who were allowed to live. But yes - and they - a lot of them have had, at some level, contact with their families because when you go to the camps in northern Iraq, a lot of the families are spending every ounce of their strength right now trying to come up with the ransoms to essentially pay the smugglers to get their girls out. So they know that they're alive. The girls will take the fighter's cell phone and run off to the bathroom and make a quick phone call or hide his phone and wait for him to leave the house and then call. And so there's contact. We know that they're - we know that many of them are still alive. And it's just absolutely gutting to think what's happening to them. GROSS: So the women who you interviewed, did they escape? Or were they released in return for ransom? CALLIMACHI: Almost all of the ones that I spoke to, what they would do is they would run away from the house of the man who was holding them. They would seek shelter in another civilian's house - Muslim, Kurdish, etc. In many cases, they would be handed back over to the abuser, and then terrible things would happen. But in the lucky instances, those people would then allow them to call their families. Their families are in touch with the smuggling network, and they're paying smugglers $5,000 - $6,000 - $10,000 per girl to get them out. There's been a big debate as to whether that money is a ransom or not. There are many cases, I think, where the money is purely going to the smugglers. There are also cases of girls that I interviewed where the fighters themselves tired of her and agreed to allow her to call her family and to negotiate a ransom for her direct release. GROSS: All right. It sounds like virtually all the sex slaves that ISIS has taken have been. . . CALLIMACHI: Yes. GROSS: . . . Yazidi women. GROSS: Why. . . CALLIMACHI: Yes. GROSS: . . . Are they Yazidi? CALLIMACHI: ISIS put out a pamphlet soon after they invaded Sinjar, which is the homeland of the Yazidi people explaining why, theologically, the Yazidi people were targeted for enslavement and why their enslavement is in their eyes legal. And it rests on the idea that the Yazidis are polytheists. The Yazidis actually believe in a single god. But underneath the single god, there are a number of sacred angels. It's not that different from Christianity, where you have Christ, God and, you know, the Holy Spirit. But anyway, because of this belief in these angels, they have determined that they're polytheists. And polytheists are the worst category, according to ISIS, that needs to - they need to be - the earth needs to be cleansed of them, in their eyes, in order to create the way for the monotheistic faith that they're trying to instill. And so they have essentially created a legal framework to do these horrific things to these young women. GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is Rukmini Callimachi who covers ISIS and al-Qaida for The New York Times. We're going to take a short break here. Then we'll be back. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is Rukmini Callimachi. She covers ISIS and al-Qaida for The New York Times. So your family is from Romania. CALLIMACHI: Yes. GROSS: And when you were 5, your family fled Romania, which was under the dictatorship of Nicolae Ceausescu. CALLIMACHI: Yes. GROSS: And officially, you weren't allowed to leave unless you pledged to come back. . . CALLIMACHI: Right. GROSS: . . . Because people weren't allowed to leave and not return. CALLIMACHI: Right. GROSS: So what you did in leaving was illegal. Had you been turned away by any of the countries that you went to afterwards? And had you been returned against your will to Romania, your mother or perhaps your mother and your grandmother would've been imprisoned. Fortunately, you found safe haven first in Switzerland and then, a few years later, in the United States. CALLIMACHI: Actually, the very first country we came to was Germany - Munich, strangely enough. And we stayed there not for very long. And then from there, Switzerland took us in. But as an - as a former refugee myself, it's actually been painful to write these stories about how ISIS is using the refugee flow to get into Europe. But as a reporter, of course, I can't turn my eyes away from it. They are using the refugee flow to get in. They are using the generosity of Germany, specifically, and Europe overall to infiltrate and carry out heinous acts. GROSS: How do you know that? CALLIMACHI: Well, we know that the November 13 attackers - 9 out of 10 of them slipped back into Europe from Syria. Of those nine, we know at least four that came on a refugee boat and were checked into the island of Theras (ph) in Greece. It's true that we don't know. . . GROSS: And you're talking about the attacks on Paris in November? CALLIMACHI: Yes, yes. Exactly. Exactly. The two guys who blew themselves up at the Stade de France - they were the first suicide bombers to carry out their attacks. They came on a refugee boat. We don't know how the others came through. But given that at least four of them came in this manner, I think it's logical to assume that the others may have, as well. And now in Germany, we're seeing - the Wuerzburg attacker was an immigrant, allegedly from Afghanistan, who was given refuge. And the Ansbach attacker was a Syrian refugee. So it doesn't - you know, even though these people are a tiny percentage of the tens of thousands of people that have come through, it does poison the water. And it does make it very difficult for leaders in Europe to deal with the policy of open borders in the face of what's happened. GROSS: Yeah. And you said it's hard for you to even write these stories because. . . CALLIMACHI: Yeah, I mean, I have. GROSS: . . . As a refugee yourself, you know. . . CALLIMACHI: Yeah. GROSS: . . . What drives somebody to face such danger - to leave. But at the same time. . . CALLIMACHI: I do. I do. GROSS: . . . You recognize that ISIS is using this as a way to get people in. CALLIMACHI: Yeah. And I find it so incomprehensible that when you're fleeing a place such as Syria - and, of course, Syria is so much worse than communist Romania ever was. You know, my family was at no point facing the peril that these families are facing. But I find it incomprehensible that you would abuse the generosity of the country that takes you in. I am forever grateful to both Germany and Switzerland for giving my family a chance and even more grateful to the United States for taking us in a couple of years later. If I hadn't, I would never be what I am today. GROSS: Rukmini Callimachi, thank you so much for talking with us. CALLIMACHI: It's my pleasure, Terry. I love to be on your show.

And as Deepa Fernandes reports, the locals in one small fishing village are mixed on whether they want more foreign beachgoers.

And in the early evenings, when the sun is going down, locals start coming out. ROGEL: Hola, me llamo Rogel.

MILEIDY ALVAREZ LA ROSA: (Through interpreter) This was our vacation house where my girls, my husband and I would come for the summer months. And then about five years ago, we decided to move here permanently and make this house a business by renting rooms.

PETER KENYON, BYLINE: With Turkey's jails already overcrowded and thousands of soldiers, judges, prosecutors and police due to face charges in connection with the failed coup, some Turks have wondered where the government will put all the alleged coup plotters. Turkey's Justice Minister Bekir Bozdag posted the answer to his Twitter account. Thirty-eight-thousand of Turkey's more than 200,000 inmates are going home early. He says no one convicted of murder, sexual assault or terror-related crimes will get early release, and it will only apply to those within two years of finishing their sentences.

As NPR's Jennifer Ludden reports, he aims to convince people to have fewer children. JENNIFER LUDDEN, BYLINE: Travis Rieder is not a climate scientist. He's a philosopher with the Berman Institute of Bioethics at Johns Hopkins, and his arguments are moral. When we meet, he's in a tweedy jacket and sneakers, speaking to several dozen students at James Madison University. TRAVIS RIEDER: How old are you going to be in 2036? Are you thinking about having kids? How old are your kids going to be in 2036? LUDDEN: Dangerous climate change will be happening by then, he says, and the world's poorest nations will suffer most even though rich countries like the U. S. create far more carbon emissions per capita. T. RIEDER: So here's what's happening when I have a kid. I'm creating a being who's doing the much greater proportion of the contribution to the harm. And she's not going to suffer for it. The other kid is. And that seems unfair. LUDDEN: What about that big climate deal in Paris. Rieder tell students it doesn't cut emissions nearly enough to avoid a catastrophic tipping point. But this might. He cites a study that finds reducing global fertility by just half a child per woman could have a huge impact if it happens soon. T. RIEDER: Thank you all for your attention. (APPLAUSE)GARRETT WILSON: It was kind of terrifying. LUDDEN: Student Garrett Wilson says before this, he never would have connected climate and kids. Valerie Smith has thought about that. She's even argued with her mom over it. VALERIE SMITH: We always have people asking, well, why wouldn't you have kids? And I think it's a great point that he makes, saying, well, no, like, you don't have to explain yourself. The people who are choosing to have children - like, maybe they're the ones that need to explain their reasons. LUDDEN: The people choosing to have children. . .

RIEDER: . . . To go through a pregnancy and everything. That mattered to me a lot. LUDDEN: In fact Sadiya wanted a big family, so Rieder caved, sort of. He decided, you can't deny someone the hard-wired human fulfillment of creating a child, but he also convinced Sadiya that the moral bar for a second one is higher. They are one and done. T. RIEDER: When I write online, I get some nasty comments, and a lot of the things that people say is, well, he obviously doesn't have any children the way he talks about it. So look; I think it's important that I exactly know the value. She's the most amazing thing we've ever done with our lives. LUDDEN: So how do you convince millions of people around the world to forgo that? Rieder has a plan.

For richer nations, Rieder says the U. S. and others should do away with tax credits for new parents and actually impose penalties like a carbon tax on kids. And he knows that sounds crazy. T. RIEDER: But children, in a cold way of looking at it, are an externality. We as parents, we as family members, we get the good, and the world, the community pays the cost. REBECCA KUKLA: What that will actually translate into is it becoming much easier for wealthy people to have children than for other people to have children. LUDDEN: Rebecca Kukla is a bioethicist at Georgetown University. She also worries that poor and minority women who have more children would be stigmatized. Of course Travis Rieder does not expect the U. S. or other countries to embrace his ideas. He'd be happy to simply change people's assumptions about having kids. But still, compared to so many ideas for addressing climate change, he says this would be easy. T. RIEDER: It's not a feat of geoengineering or econo-engineering.

The two Russian whistleblowers who provided key information on the doping scandal Vitaly Stepanov and his wife, Yuliya, are still living in a secret location in the United States. Hajo Seppelt interviewed them for his film. And Vitaly said their lives are currently in danger. Here's that clip. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"DOPING - TOP SECRET: SHOWDOWN FOR RUSSIA\")VITALY STEPANOV: In our situation, we had to out to a different country because there are thousands of messages on social networks in general and newspaper articles that just tell her, don't come back. You might be killed. MARTIN: Hajo Seppelt joins us now from Rio. Thank you so much for being with us. HAJO SEPPELT: Thank you. MARTIN: I understand that you, yourself, are under police protection. What has happened? What has changed? SEPPELT: I will not tell you because this is, as you can imagine, a confidential situation. And what I can tell you that I have received insults and threats. And so it was our decision to say that we should have a protection for me during the Olympics. That's what I can say. But please, understand - no more. MARTIN: Of course. Can you tell us more about the two whistleblowers who were profiled in your documentary? We mentioned Yuliya Stepanova, who aspires to be an Olympic runner. And her husband Vitaly was actually a former anti-doping official. SEPPELT: Yes. They came forward with information as whistleblowers. And the reaction from the IOC, you have told us about a state-run system, but now you get a punishment. You get a sanction. You're not allowed to compete at the Olympics. This sends a very worrying message to the whole world because international sports' governing bodies always try to encourage athletes, at least officially, to come forward with information to blow the whistle. And when they do so (laughter), then they're not allowed to compete at the Olympics. That doesn't make any sense from my point of view. MARTIN: It has been reported that Yuliya's World Anti-Doping Agency online profile has recently been hacked. Are the Stepanovs feeling immediately under threat? SEPPELT: People like Yuliya and Vitaly, they are not people who you can scare easily. They have done a lot. They have risked so much for sports and for helping to clean up sports. As they have always been aware about risks they could face after revealing this unbelievable system of state-run doping and cover-up in Russia so I would not say that they are scared now. But they are at least cautious. And that is exactly the reason for - they move eight or nine times within one and a half year, so it causes a lot of problems. MARTIN: They also have a young son. Correct? SEPPELT: That's what I wanted to say. They have a 2-years-old (ph) son, and that makes it even more complicated, as they have to take the responsibility of the situation. But they do it - and from my perspective - in a very courageous and very impressive way. MARTIN: So there's no one who's come to aid them and to protect them to give them some kind of cover after they shined a light on this? SEPPELT: There are some people supporting them in the internet, asking for money for donations for them. I know from a German, for example, who offered them five years free living in his apartment in Germany in order to respect and to say thank you for the enormous contribution. But officially, IOC didn't support them in the way it should have. MARTIN: How do they pass their time? SEPPELT: Training. Yuliya wants to train? And Vitaly is - at the time when Yuliya is training, Vitaly has to take care about his little son. They want to stay in the United States, and they need work permits. They need a residence permit? They want to stay in that country, as they fell protected. And maybe - I can imagine that Yuliya's dream is to become an American, a U. S. citizen in order, in the future, to compete for the United States of America in big competitions like the Olympics.

SEPPELT: People like Yuliya and Vitaly, they are not people who you can scare easily. They have done a lot. They have risked so much for sports and for helping to clean up sports. As they have always been aware about risks they could face after revealing this unbelievable system of state-run doping and cover-up in Russia so I would not say that they are scared now. But they are at least cautious. And that is exactly the reason for - they move eight or nine times within one and a half year, so it causes a lot of problems. MARTIN: They also have a young son. Correct? SEPPELT: That's what I wanted to say. They have a 2-years-old (ph) son, and that makes it even more complicated, as they have to take the responsibility of the situation. But they do it - and from my perspective - in a very courageous and very impressive way. MARTIN: So there's no one who's come to aid them and to protect them to give them some kind of cover after they shined a light on this? SEPPELT: There are some people supporting them in the internet, asking for money for donations for them. I know from a German, for example, who offered them five years free living in his apartment in Germany in order to respect and to say thank you for the enormous contribution. But officially, IOC didn't support them in the way it should have. MARTIN: How do they pass their time? SEPPELT: Training. Yuliya wants to train? And Vitaly is - at the time when Yuliya is training, Vitaly has to take care about his little son. They want to stay in the United States, and they need work permits. They need a residence permit? They want to stay in that country, as they fell protected. And maybe - I can imagine that Yuliya's dream is to become an American, a U. S. citizen in order, in the future, to compete for the United States of America in big competitions like the Olympics. MARTIN: German reporter Hajo Seppelt - his new documentary is called \"Doping - Top Secret: Showdown For Russia. \" He joined us from Rio, where he has been attending the Olympics and reporting from there.

Nearly 27 percent of the people there are 65 or older. NPR's Ina Jaffe covers aging, so, of course, she wanted to go there and check it out. She did, and she's now back sharing her reporting. This week on NPR, you'll hear her stories on how Japan is changing as its population grows older. Ina joins us now from our studios at NPR West. Hi, Ina. INA JAFFE, BYLINE: Hi, Rachel. MARTIN: First off, why is Japan the oldest nation in the world? JAFFE: Well, it's not really because people live longer, although they do have a life expectancy about five years more than in this country. But really it's because the population is shrinking. Women there just aren't having as many babies. So if nothing changes by the year 2060, people aged 65-plus will make up at least 40 percent of the population there. MARTIN: Wow. So I imagine that could, in turn, have an impact on the economy. JAFFE: Yeah, that's a real concern there because you have both this big decline in working-age population and then a strain on the social security system. So one of the government's ideas for dealing with this is to get more older people into the workforce and keep them there longer. MARTIN: How do they do that? I mean, you can't force people to work longer - or can you? JAFFE: Well, actually the bigger problem in Japan is that you can force people to retire. They have mandatory retirement there. And the age has been 60, though they're gradually raising it to 65. And you can keep working past mandatory retirement age sometimes, but there's not a lot of incentive because once you hit 60, your salary usually drops to a fraction of what you made before. So, you know, Americans would be on the phone to their lawyers, right? MARTIN: Yeah. JAFFE: But this is an accepted practice in Japan, and it's one of the things that some people I talked to say will have to change. MARTIN: Something else that goes along with an aging population, unfortunately, can be Alzheimer's, other forms of dementia. Is that a concern there? JAFFE: Oh, definitely. You know how one of the symptoms of Alzheimer's, for example, is wandering, right? So in Japan last year, more than 12,000 people with dementia were missing long enough to be reported to the police. And while most were found alive within a week, nearly 500 were found dead and 150 were never found. MARTIN: Oh my. So what is Japan doing about this? I mean, can the government do anything about that? JAFFE: Well, I went to a city called Matsudo that's taken a sort of community approach. For a few years now, they've been giving dementia awareness training to pharmacists and postal clerks and just people who volunteer to take it. And part of the thinking is that if you can't keep people from wandering, maybe you have a whole community that can keep them safe when they do. And this approach is now part of Japan's nationwide plan to deal with dementia, and millions of people there have already taken this training. MARTIN: So what's it like to just spend some time in that country? I mean, do you see evidence of that aging population? JAFFE: Oh, you do. In the cities, for example, (laughter) one of the places you see it is convenience stores. And one of the things they're doing to compete is finding ways to cater to their aging clientele. You'll find products there you'd never see in your local mini mart like prepackaged meals for people who have trouble chewing. But really the place that you see aging of Japan most clearly is in the rural areas. There's a term you hear in Japan, it's village on the edge, as in village on the edge of extinction. I went to one a few hundred miles south of Tokyo where the population has gone from around 300 people to just 30. MARTIN: Wow. JAFFE: It's now known as Scarecrow Village because a woman who lives there has repopulated the place by making scarecrows and putting them at the bus stop and in the school and in all the places people used to be. MARTIN: That is a haunting image. JAFFE: It is. It's amazing to be there. MARTIN: You can hear Ina's stories on the aging of Japan this week on other NPR programs or find them online at npr. org.

You can say one thing about these games - they have not lacked for drama. NPR's Lulu Garcia-Navarro has been covering the Olympics from outside the arenas. She joins us now to talk about how things went for the host city, Rio de Janeiro. Hi, Lulu. LOURDES GARCIA-NAVARRO, BYLINE: Hi. MARTIN: So let's start with soccer briefly. I mean, we just heard Melissa's report there. It must have been so satisfying for Brazil to win this, right? GARCIA-NAVARRO: Oh my gosh, you have no idea. It was just a glorious way for these games to end for Brazil, you know, an amazing moment. My neighborhood erupted into cheers. There were fireworks over the city. You know, Brazil's had such a hard year politically, economically. It was just a great moment for them. MARTIN: All right, so let's talk about some of the hard stuff. Before the games even began, there was all this talk about, of course, the Zika outbreak, terrorism even, the water quality. Did these end up being issues in the games? GARCIA-NAVARRO: You know, Zika and terrorism, thankfully not. Water quality did. You know, at least one Olympian got sick. Sailing teams did complain of trash in the bay slowing them down. And then there were those green pools in the aquatic center, if you'll remember, though they had apparently - that had something to do with people dumping the wrong chemicals in the water. You know, other challenges - empty seats, organizational problems with transport, food - it seemed that there was some sort of crisis, big or small, every single day. So that was the bad. What really elevated these games were the Brazilians themselves. You know, their hospitality, their joy. Many Brazilians in Rio really warmed to these games, embraced them, and that was beautiful to see. MARTIN: OK, we have to mention it, the scandal you cannot turn away from, try as you might. Ryan Lochte and what has ended up turning into a diplomatic incident. How big of a shadow did this cast over the games? GARCIA-NAVARRO: It's still generating multiple news stories in the Brazilian press. You know, Lochte in an interview last night on NBC said, quote, he \"over-exaggerated that story. \" He also gave an interview to Brazilian TV, and that's made headlines here all over again. He apologized. But, you know, the Lochte story really tapped into something here. Brazilians don't feel like Lochte's various apologies have really cut it, so I'm not sure he should be vacationing here anytime soon. MARTIN: OK, so now let's turn to the Paralympics also being held in Rio. But they're in a lot of trouble now. What's going on? GARCIA-NAVARRO: Yeah, you know, the Paralympic Committee announced unprecedented cuts to the event. Rio 2016 has simply run out of money, Rachel, and they're scaling back. Only 12 percent of tickets have been sold. So the question is why did they run out of cash? Why won't they open up their books to show what happened? And also, why was so little muscle put into promoting these Paralympics, which were such a success in London? That's what many people are asking themselves. The spokesman for Rio 2016 has denied reports that they took money from the Paralympic budget to pay for the Olympics. Lots of criticisms. We heard Britain's most prominent Paralympian, Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson, saying it sends out the message that the Paralympic Games doesn't mean as much to the organizing committee. And she warned that it risks making Paralympians into second-class citizens. MARTIN: And just real briefly, Lulu, you live in Rio. You've been covering the buildup to the games. What's your take? Was this an Olympics that Brazilians could be proud of? GARCIA-NAVARRO: I think it was, but I think it's a mixed review. And I'm going to let Brazilians speak for themselves on this. A new poll came out this morning, and it was ambivalent. Sixty-two percent of the population believe the Olympics brought more costs than benefits, and yet 57 percent believe it improved Brazil's image abroad. And I think that's what I've experienced here. People feel that the games could've been organized better. They know that the bill is going to come due. But they also feel that Brazil was presented in a positive way to the world, and they're extremely proud of that. MARTIN: NPR's Lulu Garcia-Navarro in Rio. Thanks so much, Lulu.

The attack Saturday was on a wedding celebration in the city of Gaziantep. More than 50 people were killed, and more than 20 of them were children. Turkey's leaders initially pointed the finger at ISIS, but now say they're still investigating. Gaziantep is near the Syrian border. It's a place NPR's Deborah Amos knows well. And she's been following the situation and joins us now. Deb, you've been getting more information on the target of this attack. What have you found out? DEBORAH AMOS, BYLINE: First of all, the casualties of this one were really heart-wrenching. One mother lost four of her five children and her husband was gravely injured. This was a wedding. The groom is the nephew of a Kurdish member of parliament. So this was a big political affair in the city in one of its big wedding halls. The dancing spilled out onto the street. And according to people I talked to in the city, this is where the bombers struck, which is why it could be that so many children died in the attack - they were outside. The bride and groom survived. The early reporting of this was that it was a child suicide bomber. And Turkish authorities said that earlier in the attack. And then they walked that back. They're now saying they're not sure who it was, how old that person is and who actually did it. SIEGEL: Now, at first, the Turks said that ISIS was behind this. If that were the case, why would ISIS attack Kurds in Turkey now? AMOS: There's no one in the city who doesn't think that it was ISIS in the calls I made today. And what they think is it is payback for the capture of Manbij. It's a city on the Syrian side of the border. It was controlled by ISIS. In fact, it was the capital of their smuggling operation. This is where they stored their big earthmovers to get at ancient artifacts, you know, for funding. And it was a Kurdish militia that played the central role in the recent capture of Manbij. They also had American airpower. They kicked ISIS out. And it was seen as a major defeat. So it appears that ISIS decided to take the fight inside Turkey's southern border. There may be some complex messaging going on here because this was an attack on a Kurdish wedding. So it could be an attempt to drive Turks and Kurds further apart. There were protests in the city from Kurds saying the Turks didn't do enough to protect them at this wedding. SIEGEL: You know the area. Is - Gaziantep is the city where this happened. Is it an especially volatile place? AMOS: You know, Robert, I used to go before the Syrian uprising. And it was just the opposite. Before the war, this was a Turkish city where Kurds and Turks lived in relative harmony. The Syrians crossed the border to shop. Kurds make up about a third of the population. The economy was dynamic. Money makes harmony possible. It was a big city - 1. 5 million thriving restaurants and businesses. SIEGEL: Well, how does what's happening in Gaziantep and this explosion, how does it or might relate to the Syrian civil war next door? AMOS: Well, almost everybody will tell you that Gaziantep has been hijacked by the Syrian conflict. It's about an hour's drive to the border. Refugees poured into this city. It's even hard to know how many there are. We could be talking about one-third of the city are Syrian refugees. That border is porous. It's been a transit city for the militants of ISIS. It's been a haven for displaced Turkish Kurds who've come from the east. You know, there is conflict on that side of Turkey. So it's a hub of all of these tensions. It makes it incredibly explosive. And that's what we saw on Saturday with the attack on this wedding. SIEGEL: Now, we should note that there's another conflict, and that is between Turkey and at least some of its Kurdish citizens. There's an insurgency and a counterinsurgency that Turkey has been waging. Might this relate to that? AMOS: Well, certainly it does with the people who were at the wedding. These are displaced Kurds. They came from the east. They are in neighborhoods in Gaziantep, say people who live there, that are very nationalistic. And so it's interesting that, if this is ISIS, they picked those particular people to attack because that does drive a wedge between Turks and Kurds. And there is a historic population of Kurds in Gaziantep that've been there for a long time. These are newcomers. And their politics are very, very strident on what they want for their people. SIEGEL: That's NPR's Deborah Amos following the news of the bombing in southern Turkey. Deb, thanks. AMOS: Thank you, Robert.

He ended up in Egypt, teaching at the American University in Cairo, and it was there that the man from Texas started his obsession with the Middle East. Since then, Wright has written a lot about the region and about terrorism as a staff writer for The New Yorker. His book is a compilation of his magazine pieces called \"The Terror Years: From al-Qaeda to the Islamic State. \" Wright says his interest in terrorism goes back before 9/11 when he was asked to write a movie. LAWRENCE WRIGHT: You know, it came out in 1998. It was called \"The Siege\" with Denzel Washington and Bruce Willis and Annette Bening. And the question that the movie ask is, what would happen if terrorism came here as it already had in, say, London and Paris? You know, how would we react if it happened in New York? (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"THE SIEGE\")TONY SHALHOUB: (As Agent Frank Haddad) It's a Broadway theater. It went off just as people were getting up for intermission. There are bodies everywhere. MCEVERS: You write in the forward to your book that the movie, at the time in 1998, didn't do super well, but you know, people sort of went back to it and said, whoa, this was kind of predicting some things. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"THE SIEGE\")DENZEL WASHINGTON: (As Anthony Hubbard) What if they really want is for us to heard children into stadiums like we're doing and put soldiers on the street and have Americans looking over their shoulders, bend the law, shred the Constitution just a little bit because if we torture him, General, we do that. And everything that we have bled and fought and died for is over, and they've won. WRIGHT: It was the most-rented movie in America after 9/11. MCEVERS: And what do you think was it - it was that resonated with people after 9/11? WRIGHT: I think there were two things. One was it explained and looked at the problem of terrorism. But the other thing is, the movie has a happy ending, and after 9/11, people weren't sure how this movie was going to end. MCEVERS: So 9/11 happens, and then there was this piece that you wrote about a man named John O'Neill. It's called \"The Counter-Terrorist. \" I will never forget reading this piece for the first time in The New Yorker. You came across him when you were combing through obituaries. . . WRIGHT: Yeah. MCEVERS: . . . After 9/11, trying to find a way to understand it. And that's when you first read about O'Neill. WRIGHT: You know, if you recall, the planes were all grounded at that time. And I live in Austin, so I was unable to get to New York for several days. And I was desperate to get involved in this. I didn't know how to reduce this vast tragedy just to a human scale. So I was combing through obituaries, streaming online, and on this Washington Post site, I found O'Neill's obituary. And it made him out to be something of a disgrace. He had been the head of counterterrorism in New York, and he had been washed out of the bureau because he had taken classified information out of the office. MCEVERS: Right. WRIGHT: And then he wound up getting a job as the head of security at the World Trade Center. You know, his job was to get Osama bin Laden, and instead, bin Laden got him. And I thought at the time it was ironic. But I don't see it that way anymore. He took that job because he knew that al-Qaida would come and try to finish the job on the World Trade Center. They had bombed it once before in 1993, so he instinctively put himself at Ground Zero. MCEVERS: I mean is that what fascinated you about him - not just that it's this tragedy in the most classic sense but that here was a person who, had he lived, maybe would have known a lot about this organization and their motives? WRIGHT: As I read more about him and talked to his colleagues, I realize he was one of the very few people in America, especially in the American intelligence community, who really appreciated the danger that al-Qaida posed and fought against it, oftentimes fighting against his own bureau which just did not have al-Qaida on a top priority. It was O'Neill and a handful of people that really recognized the peril that America was in. MCEVERS: The most recent piece in this book is a piece where you write about the Americans held captive by the so-called Islamic State and then of course later executed. WRIGHT: Right. MCEVERS: And you also write about the efforts to negotiate their release. What, if anything, in your opinion could have been done differently? WRIGHT: I'm not saying that they might have been able to survive unless the American government had taken the same policy as the Europeans, which was simply to pay off the kidnappers. But the American government opposes that and also, at the time, opposed any American, even the parents of these individuals, paying for the - to ransom their child. So essentially these parents were left by themselves. They had no idea how to deal with ISIS. MCEVERS: Right. WRIGHT: And they got very little help from the State Department or the FBI. The - when the - you know, the father, for instance, of Steven Sotloff, one of those killed, said that, you know, every week at the same time, the FBI would call him, but they wouldn't call him to give information. They were calling to find out if he had anything to tell them. There was. . . MCEVERS: Wow. WRIGHT: . . . You know, rarely any moment when the FBI or the State Department shared information or offered to help in any meaningful way. MCEVERS: Now that the Islamic State has taken territory in Iraq and Syria and is sponsoring attacks in the West, it seems that al-Qaida as we knew it isn't as relevant anymore, you know? Ayman al-Zawahiri of course now runs the show, but he's viewed as a much less fearsome leader than Osama bin Laden. Should we still care about al-Qaida? WRIGHT: Well, al-Qaida is the parent with, you know, all the progeny it has multiplied all over the world. So yes, the mother organization has been reduced. It's not extinct. MCEVERS: Yeah. WRIGHT: But it has certainly been confined. But the idea that they have put forward is alive in the world and spreading rapidly, unfortunately. MCEVERS: You have watched and written about and reported on al-Qaidaism for so many years. You've also watched America in this time. How has this changed us? WRIGHT: Well, I was reflecting about how when I was in high school, I took a date to Love Field in Dallas. That was actually the name of the airport. But it was a place where a lot of dates went when you didn't have any money. MCEVERS: (Laughter). WRIGHT: And I remember that we climbed into this airliner that had just come from some European place. We decided it must have been Paris. And we sat in the first class compartment, and the stewardesses, as you called them then, brought us a snack. MCEVERS: No way. WRIGHT: And we pretended that we were really cosmopolitan, and then we went up in the FAA tower. Come on in, Kids. And so we sat down and watched these airplanes land. Now, that was America. And I'm so struck, you know, just going into an office building where you have to be photographed. You go visit the Liberty Bell in Philadelphia, and you have to take off your shoes and your belt. These impingement on ordinary liberty the kinds of things we took entirely for granted - those are gone. But if they're forgotten, they'll be permanently gone, and I think it's important that we keep in our minds the idea of that kind of freedom. And if we lose that, then I think that terrorism really will have won. MCEVERS: Well, Larry Wright, thank you so much. WRIGHT: It's been my pleasure, Kelly.

Freshta Ibrahimi is a senior at the school. She just walked out of a campus cafeteria with a group of friends when she heard the attack begin. FRESHTA IBRAHIMI: We were talking, and we were having chat and were just laughing, and we heard the gunfire. We were shocked - and suddenly the bomb blast. I saw red color, and that color was from the blast. SIEGEL: And during that blast, she lost sight of her friends. Security guards told students to stay put, but Freshta and others decided it was safer to leave campus, so they ran. And Freshta says she cried as she did so, fearing the students were the targets. IBRAHIMI: I couldn't feel my body, and there were other girls that were helping me to just run. There were boys that - they bought me water because I couldn't breathe anymore. When I got to a main street, I was feeling better, yeah, because there were more people. SIEGEL: For more on what happened, we turn to reporter Jennifer Glasse in Kabul. Jennifer, how did this attack unfold? JENNIFER GLASSE: Robert, it started with an explosion outside the south wall of university, and then the attackers were able to get into the university - a terrifying evening for the Students - hundreds of students on campus at 7:00 when this attack started. It is because many people work during the day and then go to evening classes. So you think as many as 300 or 400 students were on the campus, and then as Freshta told you, there was gunfire. Some of the students sheltered where they were, hid, tried to find places where they could be safe. And some ran outside another gate. And that's how that's they got out. So some got out initially, but many were trapped inside. SIEGEL: Has anyone claimed responsibility for this attack? GLASSE: So far no one has claimed responsibility for this attack. SIEGEL: Now, this happened just two weeks after two members of the American University of Afghanistan staff, an American and an Australian, were kidnapped by gunmen. Is it clear whether these events are linked, and are the whereabouts of those two known? GLASSE: We don't know, and we've got no information on the whereabouts of those two men who were kidnapped in a bold attack. Right after evening classes two weeks ago on a Sunday night about 8:30 in the evening, they were pulled from their car. No one's claimed responsibility for that. We don't know their whereabouts, and it's unclear whether these two events are linked. But of course it's a terrible blow for the American University in Afghanistan. More than a thousand students full- and part-time go there, some of the best and brightest in Afghanistan. So it'll be a very difficult time for this university to get students who will be concerned about what's going to happen next with the University. This - the university closed for a couple of days after the kidnapping, and of course the siege is still underway now and the future of the university right now uncertainSIEGEL: The American University opened in 2006 with U. S. support. It's a liberal arts school. It's based on the American system. What else can you tell us about it? What can tell us about the students who are enrolled there? GLASSE: Well, it's a very modern campus. It is a liberal arts school, the only one here in Afghanistan. And so you have men and women together on the campus. They all - all the classes are in English, so they all speak very good English. So they tend to be well-educated, modern, forward-thinking Afghan. Some of them have full-time jobs and go to university in the evenings. Some of them have very prestigious jobs and are trying to better their lives. So it is a big blow for Afghanistan because this is the university that educates those who really have decided to stay here and get their education here in Afghanistan, which is critical of course at a time when so many Afghans are leaving.

S. That's why Vice President Joe Biden went there today to try to smooth things over. Relations have been particularly tough between the two countries since the failed military coup in Turkey last month. Many Turks accuse the U. S. of being involved. So Joe Biden wanted to reassure Turkey's leadership the U. S. supports them. And his visit coincided with a Turkish offensive in Syria with U. S. support against ISIS. NPR's Peter Kenyon's been following all this. And he joins us from Istanbul. Hi there. PETER KENYON, BYLINE: Hi, Kelly. MCEVERS: So a mission by Vice President Joe Biden to help mend rocky relations between these two countries - how did it go? KENYON: Well, he seems to have accomplished one thing. He has calmed down the tone. And he's quieted some of these tensions and conspiracy theories and rumors that have just been rising here among the public and fueled by a pro-government media and some officials, we must say. And one suspicion, of course, has been that the U. S. might have known in advance about the coup, if not had a role in it. Biden today denied that very emphatically. At one point, he was saying that this first news of the coup attempt took both him and President Obama completely by surprise. Here's how he put it. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: I remember at the time, when he and I heard the news, we weren't sure whether it was real or whether it was some concoction made up on the internet, on the web. I'm serious. It was so startling. KENYON: So he did a lot in that regard of emotionally showing support and solidarity. He then later met with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. And Erdogan was quite cordial. He called the Turkey-U. S. relationship a model partnership under President Barack Obama. But he repeated the demand for the extradition of this cleric, Fethullah Gulen, blamed by Turkey for the coup. Erdogan says, OK, maybe extraditions do take a while in America. But why isn't he under provisional detention? Why is he free to keep running what Erdogan calls this terrorist organization, giving interviews, trying to shape opinion? So clearly, things are getting better, but there are areas of tension still. MCEVERS: Another thing, as we said, that coincided with this visit by Biden is this Turkish offensive in Syria. It's something the U. S. has been wanting for a long time. How is that going? KENYON: Well, it started with Turkish artillery, slamming ISIS targets in northern Syria. Then Turkish fighter jets got into the act - scores of targets hit. And then the tanks went rolling in. Special forces went in. And later, the Americans chimed in with their own airstrikes. So this was largely a Turkish-led operation, certainly at the start. And later in the evening, President Erdogan announced that now this important border city of Jarabulus has been taken. It's now under the control of the Free Syrian Army. MCEVERS: And so what's your sense now? I mean is the U. S. -Turkish relationship maybe back on a more positive direction or is there still reason to worry about Turkey turning eastward, toward Russia and Iran? KENYON: Yeah, big question. As you said, this is a key relationship, has been for decades. We saw the role today of Turkey in the anti-ISIS fight. It's also a longtime NATO member. It allows U. S. jets to use the Incirlik Air Base for strikes in Syria, key actor in the migrant crisis - it goes on and on. Both countries have good reasons to keep this relationship going. But the differences aren't going away either. And President Erdogan has already been to Moscow, might go to Tehran. So it's no time for the West to be overconfident.

Then Turkish fighter jets got into the act - scores of targets hit. And then the tanks went rolling in. Special forces went in. And later, the Americans chimed in with their own airstrikes. So this was largely a Turkish-led operation, certainly at the start. And later in the evening, President Erdogan announced that now this important border city of Jarabulus has been taken. It's now under the control of the Free Syrian Army. MCEVERS: And so what's your sense now? I mean is the U. S. -Turkish relationship maybe back on a more positive direction or is there still reason to worry about Turkey turning eastward, toward Russia and Iran? KENYON: Yeah, big question. As you said, this is a key relationship, has been for decades. We saw the role today of Turkey in the anti-ISIS fight. It's also a longtime NATO member. It allows U. S. jets to use the Incirlik Air Base for strikes in Syria, key actor in the migrant crisis - it goes on and on. Both countries have good reasons to keep this relationship going. But the differences aren't going away either. And President Erdogan has already been to Moscow, might go to Tehran. So it's no time for the West to be overconfident. MCEVERS: That's NPR's Peter Kenyon in Istanbul. Thanks. KENYON: Thanks, Kelly.", "section": "World", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Ties have been strained between the two countries since an attempted coup last month. Some Turks believe the United States knew about the plot in advance or even supported it. After meeting Turkey's prime minister, Vice President Biden was emphatic in his denial. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)VICE PRES JOE BIDEN: The people of the United States of America abhor what happened and under no circumstances would support anything remotely approaching the cowardly act of the treasonous members of your military. GREENE: Now, let's remember, Turkey is an important ally for the United States. It's a NATO member and central in the fight against ISIS, working closely with the U. S. military. Biden reminded Turks that this is a relationship that benefits both sides. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BIDEN: The people of Turkey have no greater friend - if you'll excuse me for being so self-serving - have no greater friend than the United States of America. GREENE: OK, let's talk about this with our correspondent who's based in Istanbul. NPR's Peter Kenyon is on the line. Peter, good morning. PETER KENYON, BYLINE: Hi, David. GREENE: So are they patching things up? KENYON: Well, yes and no. The tone of the meeting between Biden and Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim was very friendly and respectful as best we can tell from the news conference they did afterwards. But it was also clear that some of what happened in the meeting was an airing of views, not necessarily a meeting of minds. GREENE: (Laughter) Good way to put it. KENYON: Biden even joked - yeah, well, Biden was moved to joke towards the end about having had a frank and candid exchange of views, which, as you know, is standard diplomatic speak for not getting along. GREENE: Yeah, when you hear frank and candid you wonder how angry things got if they got angry. KENYON: Yeah, a good question. But a big part of Biden's visit beyond that is to clear the air about some of the suspicions, the claims that have been circulating - you've already mentioned some of them - starting in the pro-government media, but even extending to some members of the government, about whether America really supports Turkey's elected government. And Biden was all in on that. He denied it all. And he, you know, saluted the Turkish people. But there are still some differences of opinion remaining, and they're not going to disappear immediately. GREENE: And one of those differences involves this Islamic cleric, who is based in Pennsylvania right now, who the Turks really blame for masterminding the coup. I mean, is this something that we believe came up in these meetings? KENYON: Oh, it did. It's the really big issue for Turkey. There's no chance it wasn't going to come up on their side. Fethullah Gulen - he's lived in Pennsylvania for years - denies any involvement in the coup attempt. But most Turks, many Turks at least, are convinced he was behind it. The government has warrants out for his arrest, demanding his return. Biden was quite sympathetic - he spoke directly to this - about the anger felt on the streets of Turkey. But he didn't budge on the need to satisfy due process in the legal world. Here's what he said. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BIDEN: We have no, no, no, no interest whatsoever in protecting anyone who has done harm to an ally. None. But we need to meet the legal standard requirement under our law. KENYON: Now, the prime minister on the Turkish side was pretty appreciative of some of what's happened - the U. S. expert delegation that just spent two days here going over the evidentiary issues and other technical things. But he did repeat that Turkey's wish is that all this legal procedure could just happen instantly, as he put it, and result - let's get to the end game and get Fethullah Gulen back here to face charges. So clearly that's still a difference. GREENE: OK. So Biden's saying this is something that would have to work through the legal process. You know, Peter, interesting timing here because this meeting is taking place at a moment when the Turkish military has just moved into Syria going after ISIS. I mean, the U. S. and Turkey have been working hand in hand in that fight. What is the latest there? KENYON: Well, it's a big deal for the Turkish military, you know, which as we know is still recovering from this failed coup attempt. Turkish tanks, special forces entered Syria in an unusual show of military force on the ground. This is largely a Turkish effort. There is some U. S. air surveillance support. There's ground troops from the Free Syrian Army and other Western-backed rebel groups but an unusually strong role for Turkey this time. And President Recep Tayyip Erdogan says, last weekend's bombing in Gaziantep - 54 dead at a wedding - that was the last straw. And the big goal is to clear ISIS out of the border area, but it also has another effect. It makes sure that Syrian Kurdish forces do not take this border town of Jarablus. And that's something Turkey is eager to prevent. GREENE: And just remind us there about the Kurds, Peter, because some disagreement - I mean, Turkey has always considered Kurdish militias as terrorist groups coming after Turkey within its borders. But the United States has been working with Kurds in the fight against ISIS, right? KENYON: Well, that's exactly right. And it's a red line for the Turks - the Euphrates River in Syria. And the Kurdish fighters crossed that river when they took the city of Manbij from ISIS. Turkey wants them back across to the west side of the river. And today, Vice President Biden was explicit, saying we have told the Kurds that they better get back across the river or they're going to lose American support. GREENE: OK, lots to talk about as Vice President Joe Biden visits Turkey today. We've been speaking with NPR's Peter Kenyon in Istanbul. Peter, thanks a lot. KENYON: Thanks, David.

It can be a slow, frustrating art, especially with allies who cooperate on some issues and disagree sharply on others. Turkey is one of them - vital on challenges like ISIS, Iraq, Syria and the migrant crisis. NPR's Peter Kenyon has our report, the latest in the NPR project with member stations called A Nation Engaged. PETER KENYON, BYLINE: After a violent coup attempt against the Turkish government last month, relations with the U. S. plummeted. Some Turks accused the U. S. of being behind the uprising, and the U. S. watched as a government it once hailed as a democratic model arrested thousands and squashed dissent. But then just last week came signs that Ankara and Washington were getting back on the same page in both military and diplomatic terms. (SOUNDBITE OF GUNFIRE)KENYON: News footage showed Turkish tanks moving into Syria to fight Islamic State forces. It was sweet music to U. S. officials who've been pushing Turkey to do more against the militants next door. (SOUNDBITE OF GUNFIRE)KENYON: Hours later, Vice President Joe Biden was in Ankara, heaping American praise on Turkey's controversial leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan and declaring undying friendship. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: We say it again. You have no greater friend than the United States of America. We've seen that borne out each time we stand together, face down threats to our shared security and our common values. KENYON: But few people think this visit solved the problem. It's a good example of how Washington relies on its allies in troubled regions, but as we'll see, those allies have agendas of their own. In Turkey's case, that was clear during the run up to the 2003 U. S. invasion of Iraq. Turkey opposed it, worried about violence spilling back over its borders. But the U. S. was determined to go in via Turkey. Turkey's former ambassador to Washington Faruk Logoglu recalls the U. S. arm-twisting. FARUK LOGOGLU: They really wanted to put American soldiers into Iraq through Turkey, and they didn't want to hear anything else. This is what they wanted, and they wanted it now. They were in a hurry. KENYON: Turkey said no, and the troops had to be rerouted through Kuwait. Relations went into the deep freeze. Right about then, America named a new ambassador to Turkey - Eric Edelman, former advisor to Dick Cheney and, to Turks, the embodiment of what they saw as America's my-way-or-the-highway approach to Mideast policy. Edelman still remembers how his predecessor greeted him. ERIC EDELMAN: You told me, you're very lucky. You're arriving at the absolute nadir of the U. S. -Turkish relationship. Things can only go up from here. That turned out to be not completely accurate (laughter). KENYON: Edelman went on to be labeled the worst U. S. ambassador in history by pro-government Turkish columnists. He remembers waiting weeks for meetings with top leaders. But even when the relationship sours, one symbol of Turkish-American cooperation endures. It's deep in southeast Turkey just 70 miles from the Syrian border. (SOUNDBITE OF JET ENGINE)KENYON: That's a war plane taking off from Incirlik Air Base used by the U. S. Air Force for decades. Incirlik was built by the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers in the early 1950s with the Cold War underway. Incirlik village adjacent to the base is where generations of American military families grew up alongside Turks. They shopped in Turkish markets, and to hear local resident Sadat Kayhan tell it, everyone got along fine. He works on the base and thinks back to the 1990s when Americans were everywhere. SADAT KAYHAN: (Through interpreter) We took them all to tourist areas. We would ride in cars with big American eagles on them. Everyone knew we were with the Americans, and no one would bother us. KENYON: But amid several terror attacks in Turkey last year, Americans were restricted to the base. The fortunes of Incirlik village which had begun to decline in 2003 fell further. Many military family members have been sent home. The off-base houses they rented sit empty, and shops that cater to them are boarded out. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: (Speaking Turkish). UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: (Speaking Turkish). KENYON: Two retirees who worked for decades on the base say there's no reason for the Americans to be cut off. \"There was life. It was fun, people all around,\" says Mustafa Tutkal. \"It shouldn't be locked down,\" adds Jumali Yamur, who thinks the based restrictions are more about politics than terrorism. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: (Speaking Turkish). KENYON: As to where Turkish-American ties are heading, there are things the U. S. can offer - support for Turkey's essentially stalled bid to join the EU. The U. S. could help rein in the ambitions of Kurdish factions, longtime Turkish adversaries in Syria and Iraq. And trade and investment would be welcomed in Turkey's fragile economy. At the same time, Washington is worried by Turkey's democratically elected president Recep Tayyip Erdogan's crackdown on the media, freedom of expression and civil liberties. Former ambassador to Turkey Eric Edelman thinks the relationship is in for an extended bumpy period. And just like the last crisis when he was in Ankara, it's vital that Turkish politicians don't go too far in whipping up anti-American feelings. EDELMAN: You know, my concern was then, while I was there - and I repeatedly told the government - you know, if you guys don't tamp this down a bit, some American is going to get hurt. And then there's really going to be hell to pay. KENYON: For its part, Turkey wants the U. S. to extradite an elderly Islamic cleric in Pennsylvania it says orchestrated the failed coup. And if it doesn't do that or the U. S. pressures Turkey on human rights, it could turn eastward to boost relations with Russia or Iran. But ex-ambassador Faruk Logoglu says in the end, Turkey remains fundamentally aligned with the West. LOGOGLU: No, I think it's not going to be an earthquake type of rupture.

I sat down with him this morning shortly before he flew to China for the next G20 meeting. We were at the Brookings Institution in Washington to talk about trade and other global economic issues, and I began by asking him, at this point, are the TPP and a proposed deal with Europe, the TTIP, dead? JACK LEW: No. There's a strong case for a good trade agreement, which TPP is, and we're going to continue to press forward, as the president has indicated. We're going to continue to work with the Europeans. Whether we can finish it or not I can't guarantee, but we're going to still try to get that done. SIEGEL: But on TPP where you've lost Secretary Clinton as a supporter it seems, do you read the opposition to that as just an election year kerfuffle, or is there something changing in the way Americans see trade agreements and in the way Washington had better negotiate trade agreements? LEW: You know, Robert, I think that the benefits of the market access for American workers are clear. I think what we need to be more clear at is how the benefits of trade agreements get to workers, how workers are equipped with the training they need to have the jobs in the new economy, how companies share the benefits of growth with workers. We have to make a stronger case, a better case, but the substance, the facts are clear. SIEGEL: Secretary Lew, I'm not hearing you feeling the tectonic plates about trade policy shifting in the United States. I hear you feeling things haven't been presented exactly right; they could be sold better. I'm not hearing you detect some fundamental change in this issue. SIEGEL: Look; what I believe is that there's a lot of anxiety and anger amongst working people around the world. It's not just in the U. S. We're seeing it in many, many parts of the world. I think that is a message to global financial policymakers that what we've been saying for a long time has to become central. And that is, how do we make sure that the benefits of a growing economy reach working people? It will not help working people to have a shrinking economy. Right now the United States economy would be doing better if global growth was stronger. That would mean more demand for U. S. goods and services. So we need a stronger global economy, but we also need to make sure the benefits are broadly shared. SIEGEL: What do you tell an American who's anxious about the budget deficit and the debt and who sees the economy not strong enough for us to undertake either the spending cuts or the tax increases that might reduce the deficit and not strong enough to grow in a way that there would be more revenues and just watching the deficit grow? LEW: You know, people have to focus on not just the nominal number of what the size of the deficit is but the deficit as a share of the economy. When we came into office, it was roughly 10 percent of GDP. It's now under 3 percent of GDP. That is the most dramatic reduction in deficit in history. It's comparable with the post-World War II reduction. SIEGEL: Isn't that share moving up a little bit right now? LEW: It is ticked up a little bit, but it's in the zone of a sustainable level. And when - if you ask me today, what is the most pressing need, it is more important to invest more in infrastructure and training today to build the economic foundation for growth that will throw off more income and more revenue in the future than to get an incremental amount of deficit and debt reduction over the next few years. SIEGEL: When I ask you about Ireland, Apple and taxes. Why is the U. S. critical of the European Commission billing Apple for billions in taxes to pay Ireland? Aren't they trying to cope with global tax evasion, something which we think is a problem that should be handled? LEW: We have a shared view that companies should not be able to avoid taxation by shifting profits and by using loopholes in international tax laws. What's not appropriate is for, in the name of state aid, Europe to be rewriting tax law retroactively, reaching into a tax base that properly should be a U. S. tax base because it's U. S. income and doing it in a way that I think ultimately will hurt the business environment because it's going to create uncertainty in Europe. SIEGEL: But it sounds - in the case of Apple, it sounds odd. It sounds as if the U. S. is saying to Europe, how dare you do something about this? We're busy not doing something about this. It's our job not to do. LEW: I think that the process of working tax reform through Congress typically takes many years. It's not unusual for it to start in one administration and end in another. What's not appropriate is for Europe to preempt the ability for the United States to address that, which is what I've said is a potential outcome of the European action. SIEGEL: Secretary Lew insists he's optimistic about the economy, although he says policymakers should pay attention to the global economic debates that have been so heated this year. He says more attention should be paid to spreading the benefits of trade, not reducing it. And he paints a glowing picture of an economic future that he says is possible. LEW: It will be a 21st century economy. It will have technology that's different. It will have trade practices that are different. But we can have high standards that protect workers' rights, the environmental standards, good business practices and global markets that give U. S. workers and businesses the ability to get a fair share of the global markets. That's who we're fighting for. SIEGEL: That sounds like a beautiful world. I mean that sounds a far cry from the anxiety you've described of working people all around the world. LEW: I don't disagree that the anxiety is there, but I also take optimism from the fact that there are policies to address that. And if you look, for example, at the TPP, there are labor provisions in the TPP that are already driving an improvement in labor standards in countries like Vietnam and Mexico. And it is already having an impact to level the playing field and improve the ability for U. S. competition. What we can't do is pull away from the world. SIEGEL: But what are the chances of the TPP being approved in the lame duck session? LEW: We are going to continue to press for it. We think the case is strong, and the opportunity is there. And we're determined to get it done. SIEGEL: Treasury Secretary Jack Lew, thanks a lot for talking with us once again. LEW: Great to be with you, Robert. ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:  One person convinced of the benefits of global trade to the American economy is Treasury Secretary Jack Lew. I sat down with him this morning shortly before he flew to China for the next G20 meeting. We were at the Brookings Institution in Washington to talk about trade and other global economic issues, and I began by asking him, at this point, are the TPP and a proposed deal with Europe, the TTIP, dead? JACK LEW: No. There's a strong case for a good trade agreement, which TPP is, and we're going to continue to press forward, as the president has indicated. We're going to continue to work with the Europeans. Whether we can finish it or not I can't guarantee, but we're going to still try to get that done. SIEGEL: But on TPP where you've lost Secretary Clinton as a supporter it seems, do you read the opposition to that as just an election year kerfuffle, or is there something changing in the way Americans see trade agreements and in the way Washington had better negotiate trade agreements? LEW: You know, Robert, I think that the benefits of the market access for American workers are clear. I think what we need to be more clear at is how the benefits of trade agreements get to workers, how workers are equipped with the training they need to have the jobs in the new economy, how companies share the benefits of growth with workers. We have to make a stronger case, a better case, but the substance, the facts are clear. SIEGEL: Secretary Lew, I'm not hearing you feeling the tectonic plates about trade policy shifting in the United States. I hear you feeling things haven't been presented exactly right; they could be sold better. I'm not hearing you detect some fundamental change in this issue. SIEGEL: Look; what I believe is that there's a lot of anxiety and anger amongst working people around the world. It's not just in the U. S. We're seeing it in many, many parts of the world. I think that is a message to global financial policymakers that what we've been saying for a long time has to become central. And that is, how do we make sure that the benefits of a growing economy reach working people? It will not help working people to have a shrinking economy.

N. secretary general. Ban Ki-Moon's term ends this year, and there are 10 candidates vying to replace him. The one leading the straw polls is the former head of the U. N. 's refugee agency. He's well-respected, but this election process is not playing out the way many had hoped. NPR's Michele Kelemen explains why. MICHELE KELEMEN, BYLINE: At a time when the world is facing so many global challenges, the U. N. needs a skilled diplomat with moral authority, says Mogens Lykketoft, who's president of the U. N. General Assembly. MOGENS LYKKETOFT: There were very high expectations, and the world needs the best possible person. KELEMEN: The Danish diplomat tried to pry open this election process beyond just the 15 Security Council members, letting all U. N. member states hear from the candidates directly in a first-ever televised debate. But these days, the council is back to its usual non-transparent straw polls where the 15 members either encourage or discourage each candidate. LYKKETOFT: It's a little ridiculous that there's no official announcement, but half an hour after the end of the straw polls, all the media know the results. KELEMEN: Lykketoft also has been surprised that women haven't polled well, even though many U. N. member states would like to see a woman at the helm. That frustrates Jean Krasno, too. She teaches at the City College of New York and runs a website devoted to the female candidates. JEAN KRASNO: It's so, so frustrating that the Security Council is just not really listening. KELEMEN: There are still five women in the running, including a Bulgarian who heads the U. N. 's cultural organization, Argentina's foreign minister, a New Zealander who runs the U. N. 's development program and a Costa Rican woman who led successful international climate negotiations, but who came in last in Monday's straw poll. There are various reasons for these outcomes, says Richard Gowan, who teaches at Columbia University. RICHARD GOWAN: Some people believe that this is because, in secret, a lot of male ambassadors in New York prefer the U. N. to be a boys' club. I think there is some truth in that, but I think there are also a lot of political games involved. KELEMEN: And as usual, he says, it mostly comes down to the U. S. and Russia. GOWAN: Susanna Malcorra from Argentina is seen as being very close to the U. S. , which has been to her disadvantage with Russia and China. Irina Bokova from Bulgaria is seen as being very close to Russia, which means that Western powers are wary of her. So it's partly about gender, but it's also a lot to do with big power politics at a time when the U. N. is a very divided place. KELEMEN: This U. S. -Russia struggle could prove difficult for the front runner, too. The former head of the U. N. 's Refugee Agency, Antonio Guterres, is from Portugal, and Gowan points out Russia says it is Eastern Europe's turn to have a U. N. secretary general. GOWAN: Moscow feels that if the next U. N. chief is from one of its near neighbors, it will have additional power over him or her. However, the Russians are realists, and they may eventually be prepared to make a deal. And there have been some hints that they might even be willing to accept Guterres as secretary general. KELEMEN: That is, if Guterres appoints a deputy from Eastern Europe. Gowan says that's the kind of horse trading going on now as candidates campaign before the next straw poll. The voting only gets serious when the veto-holders use color-coded ballots, and candidates learn whether they're being discouraged by a powerful permanent member.

He was one of the architects of its propaganda strategy and oversaw its attacks overseas. The Pentagon confirmed yesterday that Adnani was a target of a strike yesterday, a U. S. strike. This morning, Russia jumped in claiming on the official Facebook page of its Ministry of Defense that Russian airstrikes had killed Adnani. The Pentagon, in fact, has not confirmed that Adnani is even dead. NPR's counterterrorism correspondent, Dina Temple-Raston, has been following the story and joins us now. Good morning. DINA TEMPLE-RASTON, BYLINE: Good morning. MONTAGNE: Well, tell us something about Adnani the person. TEMPLE-RASTON: Well, what makes Adnani different from a lot of ISIS members was that he had real ties to al-Qaida in Iraq, the precursor group to ISIS. He's Syrian, and he was one of the first foreign volunteers to fight in Iraq against the U. S. He has ties to Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the Jordanian who launched al-Qaida in Iraq after the U. S. invasion in 2003. And like the head of ISIS, Adnani spent time in Camp Bucca, the U. S. military detention facility in Iraq. So he has quite an ISIS pedigree, and symbolically at least that makes this a big loss for the group. MONTAGNE: And he has been known as the spokesman for the Islamic State. But as we've just suggested, he was much more than that. TEMPLE-RASTON: Yes, he was much more than that. The bloody videos that ISIS puts on the web are a huge part of its recruitment strategy. And Adnani was in charge of that. He was also in charge of these external operations, basically an overseas attack arm. He was very good at finding disaffected young Muslims in the West, luring them to Syria for training and then sending them back home to attack. And the external operations unit answered directly to him, and he answered directly to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. The terrorists who were behind the November 13 Paris attacks on cafes and concert halls, they were a product of that operations unit. MONTAGNE: And why was he so effective? TEMPLE-RASTON: He was very smart in setting up language-specific living arrangements for foreign fighters in Syria and Iraq. So, for example, all the French speakers were together, and that made for a lot of unity in the group, which helped ensure that attacks would actually be carried out. More recently, he changed course as ISIS began to lose territory. And he began asking Muslims in the West to attack right where they were. Now, we have a recording that he's thought to have made back in May. Take a listen. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)ABU MOHAMMED AL-ADNANI: (Foreign language spoken). TEMPLE-RASTON: So what that message is saying is during the holy month of Ramadan, you need to mark this holiday or the celebration by attacking wherever you are. And it appears some people in the West took him up on that because there were a rash of small attacks across Europe this spring and summer. MONTAGNE: If his death is confirmed, what does that mean for ISIS? TEMPLE-RASTON: If he's in fact dead, that would take one of ISIS' most important leaders off the battlefield. But there are real mixed feelings about whether this so-called decapitation effort, killing top leaders, really works in dismantling a terrorist group. I mean, ISIS is particularly bureaucratic, almost like a corporation. So the idea is that even if a key leader is killed, the enterprise can continue. Traditionally, these kinds of deaths disrupt operations for a short period of time. And then the group replaces a leader and they continue on. And I think that's what'll happen here.

Since that vote a couple of months ago, the British economy has not completely crashed. But the pound has fallen against the dollar - one of the things that's creating uncertainty for American finance firms and automakers based in Europe. This week, we're hearing about America's role in the world in a project called A Nation Engaged. Today, we're going to explore how the Brexit referendum has affected U. S. business and political interests there. NPR's Frank Langfitt was on the line with us from London. Good morning. FRANK LANGFITT, BYLINE: Hey. Good morning, Renee. MONTAGNE: Well, let's start with the mood of American business in the U. K. these days. LANGFITT: You know, Renee, the actual Brexit is years off. But there are certain sectors here that are already anxious and bracing for it. GM is talking about cutting hours for workers at two German plants because of lower demand in the U. K. based just on the Brexit vote alone. Ford's talking about raising prices, even looking at closing factories. The company's already taking a financial hit. Now, this is Bob Shanks. He's the company's chief financial officer. Here's how he put it in an investor call earlier this summer. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BOB SHANKS: We are expecting to have headwinds of about $200 million this year associated with Brexit, and we see the impact on Ford being somewhere in the range of 400 to 500 million dollars in each year. LANGFITT: And that's just based on the vote in June. MONTAGNE: And that is also just Detroit's view. There's also the view from London. It is Europe's financial capital. Lots of American investment banks are headquartered there. How do they see things? LANGFITT: Well, I've been talking to a lot of people on the future of finance in London, and we'll be hearing from them in a moment. But you can start even before the June referendum - what people were saying. Take Jamie Dimon - he's the CEO of JP Morgan. He came here and warned that after Brexit, the company's operation in the U. K. might not be able to do certain work in Europe, which is what most people expect. And he told workers in the U. K. office here that a lot of their jobs might actually end up going to continental Europe. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JAMIE DIMON: Today, we can service EU companies here, freely, with systems, technology, research, investment banking. After a Brexit, we cannot do it all here. And we will have to start planning for that. I don't know if it means a thousand jobs, 2,000 jobs. It could be as many as 4,000. ANDREW GRAY: This is hugely too complicated because the organizations have evolved in London over decades. LANGFITT: Andrew Gray is a partner with PricewaterhouseCoopers. He advises investment banks, insurance companies and other firms on Brexit planning. GRAY: A number of banks have estimated to replicate even part of their infrastructure in Europe could take between five and 10 years. LANGFITT: So you mean to take what they do here in the city of - in London and move it to Europe? GRAY: Yeah, I mean if. . . LANGFITT: That's a lot. GRAY: It's a huge amount of time. There are 2 million people working in financial services in the U. K. There is no capacity in a number of other European locations simply to replicate what we have. LANGFITT: Gray says companies are considering cities ranging from Dublin to Amsterdam to Paris and Luxembourg, assuming they can find the space. GRAY: You have to be looking at real estate as an option. Yeah, there is a - only a finite supply of suitable real estate in a number of these locations. And if they choose a particular location, they've got to think about issues around - you know, the people issues, which will include some of the social aspects, housing, schools. They've got to look at language skills. LANGFITT: The United Kingdom's auto business, which is seen as very successful, sends more than half its exports to the European Union. So naturally, it's worried, as well. TAMZEN ISACSSON: It's our single most important trading partner. LANGFITT: Tamzen Isacsson works for the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, a U. K. industry group. ISACSSON: It's vital for our U. K. automotive manufacturing and for our, you know, huge retail market here that we secure unfettered access to the European markets. LANGFITT: Otherwise, companies, such as GM, could face tariffs to export to the EU. And that could make it harder for plants here to win new work. GRAY: The big issues are going to be large-scale models coming up for renewal during the period of uncertainty. LANGFITT: Graham Armitage is an auto analyst for KPMG. GRAHAM ARMITAGE: You're talking about tens of thousands of jobs that could be affected. You know, not all of those under - no one would say that all of those decisions will go against the U. K. , but they're going to be tougher decisions than they would otherwise have been. MONTAGNE: So American business is anxious, uncertain about Brexit. Where is the U. S. government in all of this? LANGFITT: Well, you know, you remember, President Obama actually came here, and he urged the British to vote, stay in the EU. And it wasn't just for economic reasons, but political ones as well. And it is all connected. The U. K. has been seen as a reliable, influential ally for the U. S. on its own and in Europe. And I was talking to a guy named Anand Menon. He's a professor of European politics at King's College here in London, and this is the way he analyzed it. ANAND MENON: First and foremost, I think the United States wants a cohesive Europe. This obviously - this Brexit decision - undermines that cohesiveness to an extent. The United States wants an economically strong Europe, and in so far as Brexit has negative economic consequences for the U. K. and for continental Europe. That's not something the United States would welcome. MONTAGNE: All of that explains why the U. S. really wanted the U. K. to stay in the EU, right? LANGFITT: Absolutely. I mean, the U. K. has been very helpful to American interests in Europe and speaking for the United States on the continent. But this guy, professor Menon at King's College - he said more broadly that it was about a united Europe and that a united Europe with the U. K. - in it was a key to manage the influence of China - rising China. You know, the U. S. , the U. K. , Europe - they all shared democratic systems and values. And people see it as important for these countries to stick together as an authoritarian nation, as exerting more power across the globe. And with Brexit, you know, managing China's rise may make it just a little bit harder for the U. S. MONTAGNE: Frank, thanks very much. LANGFITT: Happy to do it, Renee. MONTAGNE: That's NPR's Frank Langfitt speaking to us from London, as part of our series A Nation Engaged. RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST:  When the United Kingdom decided to pull out of the European Union, there were dire predictions about the impact on the economy. Since that vote a couple of months ago, the British economy has not completely crashed. But the pound has fallen against the dollar - one of the things that's creating uncertainty for American finance firms and automakers based in Europe. This week, we're hearing about America's role in the world in a project called A Nation Engaged. Today, we're going to explore how the Brexit referendum has affected U. S. business and political interests there. NPR's Frank Langfitt was on the line with us from London. Good morning. FRANK LANGFITT, BYLINE: Hey. Good morning, Renee. MONTAGNE: Well, let's start with the mood of American business in the U. K. these days. LANGFITT: You know, Renee, the actual Brexit is years off. But there are certain sectors here that are already anxious and bracing for it. GM is talking about cutting hours for workers at two German plants because of lower demand in the U. K. based just on the Brexit vote alone. Ford's talking about raising prices, even looking at closing factories. The company's already taking a financial hit. Now, this is Bob Shanks. He's the company's chief financial officer. Here's how he put it in an investor call earlier this summer. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BOB SHANKS: We are expecting to have headwinds of about $200 million this year associated with Brexit, and we see the impact on Ford being somewhere in the range of 400 to 500 million dollars in each year. LANGFITT: And that's just based on the vote in June. MONTAGNE: And that is also just Detroit's view. There's also the view from London. It is Europe's financial capital. Lots of American investment banks are headquartered there. How do they see things? LANGFITT: Well, I've been talking to a lot of people on the future of finance in London, and we'll be hearing from them in a moment. But you can start even before the June referendum - what people were saying. Take Jamie Dimon - he's the CEO of JP Morgan. He came here and warned that after Brexit, the company's operation in the U. K. might not be able to do certain work in Europe, which is what most people expect. And he told workers in the U. K. office here that a lot of their jobs might actually end up going to continental Europe.

It is his last trip to Asia as president, and it's uncertain whether his policy of trying to shift U. S. focus and military forces to that region is going to go on. NPR's Anthony Kuhn joins us from the eastern city of Hangzhou. Anthony, thanks so much for being with us. ANTHONY KUHN, BYLINE: Greetings, Scott. SIMON: President Obama and the Chinese president had a meeting this morning ahead of the G-20 summit. Do we know what came out of it? KUHN: Their main achievement was that they submitted documents to the United Nations, formally joining the Paris climate agreement. And on the occasion President Obama said that some day we may see this as the moment that we finally decided to save our planet. President Xi Jinping, meanwhile, called on other countries to follow their example. Now, a lot more countries still have to formally join this agreement for it to take effect. But the U. S. and China submitted their documents ahead of schedule, and this just means that the commitments that these countries made in Paris can be put into action that much sooner. SIMON: This is the first time China has hosted this summit. Does it have a goal in mind as to why it's doing it? KUHN: Well, first of all, you know, by hosting this for the first time, to many Chinese it really marks the first time that they've had an equal seat at the rulemaking table since World War II. They feel that they're now the world's second-largest economy, and they want a say that's commensurate with that status. So far, a lot of the rules have been made by the Group of Seven or Group of Eight industrialized nations. China has not been a part of that, and they want a more equitable system represented by the G-20 that does a better job of taking into account the needs of developing nations like itself. SIMON: Do we know what's on the agenda? KUHN: The main thing they're going to focus on, Scott, is how to keep the global economy growing. The U. S. and China play a key role in that. This is a time, of course, when there's a lot of mistrust of globalization in general, and the G-20's message basically is that there's no turning back from globalization but that globalization cannot leave massive numbers of people behind. And it's got to be environmentally sustainable. And so they're going to focus very much on implementing development goals and also on climate change, as we mentioned. SIMON: Anthony, does this G-20 meeting represent any kind of farewell for U. S. policymakers to what was called the the U. S. pivot to Asia that the Obama administration had hoped to make? KUHN: Well, there's certainly no guarantee that it will continue. And, you know, President Obama is certainly expected to defend and talk about this policy a lot. But it's controversial, and it's under a lot of criticism. One of the criticisms is that the U. S. has tried to guide China's choices to follow the U. S. -led international order. But China, in many respects, does not want to accept that guidance on issues, for example, such as the South China Sea or on human rights. Also the U. S. has tried to build up a positive momentum by working on issues such as climate change, but that has not outweighed or dispelled the deep mutual strategic distrust that exists between Beijing and Washington.

Reporter Christopher Livesay was there and joins us now from Rome. Chris, first of all, just describe what must have been an amazing scene for us. CHRISTOPHER LIVESAY, BYLINE: People were from all over the world. They were standing elbow to elbow in a packed St. Peter's Square. And those most visible were waving flags from India, where Mother Teresa devoted so much of her ministry. I caught up with a delegation from West Bengal as they were singing a song. UNIDENTIFIED MEN: (Singing in foreign language). LIVESAY: That was Mother Teresa's favorite Bengali song. They played it at her funeral in 1997. Almost everyone I spoke to commented not just on Mother Teresa's work with the poor, but also how that dovetails with the person who is proclaiming her a saint today - Pope Francis. He's championed the poor since he became pope in 2013. MARTIN: And it's not just good people who become saints. It's a complicated process, right? LIVESAY: It is. A short answer to that process is basically you have to live a life that the Catholic Church would consider exemplary. But the long answer is really, really long. Canon law lists 150 articles for becoming a saint. But one of the most important requirements is to perform at least two miracles that the Vatican can verify. The beneficiary of one such miracle is Marcilio Haddad Andrino from Brazil. He spoke here at the Vatican this weekend. He said he was suffering from a fatal brain infection, but thanks to his wife's prayers to Mother Teresa he was miraculously healed. MARTIN: Mother Teresa, though, did have some critics, right? LIVESAY: She did indeed. Some disagreed with her outspoken opposition to birth control and abortion. Here she is accepting the Nobel Peace Prize in 1979. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MOTHER TERESA: If a mother can murder her own child in her own womb, what is left for you and for me? To kill each other. LIVESAY: Now, that's the Catholic Church's own policy, so no surprise critics of the church might disapprove of Mother Teresa on this point. But then there was also the company she kept. For instance, she took money from Charles Keating, the man behind the infamous savings and loan scandal of the late 1980s. She even spoke as a character witness during his trial. Another unsavory character in her circle was Jean-Claude Baby Doc Duvalier, the dictator of Haiti in the '70s and '80s. She accepted the country's Legion of Honor from him. And some critics say she simply didn't do a very good job taking care of the poor. They cite unhygenic conditions at her facilities where needles were routinely swapped without being sterilized. MARTIN: So she wasn't perfect. LIVESAY: She was flawed. But you don't have to be perfect to become a saint. In fact, Pope Francis himself said at the mass today that she deserved it.

Not another story about Hillary Clinton - this is about a U. S. Marine named Jason Brezler. Four years ago, Brezler sent an urgent message to a fellow Marine in Afghanistan warning him about a threat. The warning was not heeded. And two weeks later, three U. S. troops were dead. Now, the Marine Corps is trying to kick Brezler out because the warning used classified information. NPR veterans correspondent Quil Lawrence has the story. QUIL LAWRENCE, BYLINE: Jason Brezler deployed four times, including a tour of urban combat in Fallujah. In 2010, he was at a remote base in Helmand, Afghanistan. The mission was to support Afghan forces against the Taliban. Brezler says his biggest problem was a corrupt local police chief. JASON BREZLER: Sarwar Jan - he was a threat to not only the Afghans but our own Marines. LAWRENCE: Sarwar Jan was maybe linked to the Taliban. He was also a pedophile who preyed on local boys, something alarmingly common among Afghan warlords. Recently, there's been a debate about whether U. S. forces should tolerate Afghan allies who keep kids at their barracks. Back in 2010, there was no policy. Brezler couldn't fire Sarwar Jan, but he could kick him off the base. BREZLER: We put Sarwar Jan on the next helicopter, and once he left, we could've probably had a parade the next day through the bazaar. The Afghans were absolutely elated. LAWRENCE: Brezler went home. In the summer of 2012, he was in the Marine Reserves and working as a Brooklyn firefighter. On the side, he was getting a master's degree. BREZLER: So I'm sitting at a conference table in Oklahoma taking, I believe, a public budgeting class, and I received an email, and the title was \"Sarwar Jan Is Back\" - all caps, exclamation point, exclamation point. LAWRENCE: It was a forwarded request for information from a Marine in Helmand. Sarwar Jan was living on a U. S. base again. He'd brought a small group of underage Afghan boys to serve him there. BREZLER: And my reaction, it was largely a visceral one. I was like, are you freaking kidding me? LAWRENCE: Brezler searched his laptop - it was the same one he'd had with him in Helmand - and he found the dossier on Sarwar Jan. He hit reply all and send. That set off a chain of consequences but not the one Brezler intended. MIKE BOWE: As soon as he sends it, and then the Marine on the other side in Afghanistan says, this is marked classified. LAWRENCE: That's Jason Brezler's lawyer, Mike Bowe. He sat in on our interview. BOWE: And so at the first break during class, he calls on his cellphone to his CO and he says, look, this is what just happened. So he self-reports right away like he's supposed to do. BREZLER: My boss, my battalion commander, who at that point professionally I had known for several years - we had served in Fallujah together at the height of the insurgency - and he said, all right, it sounds like minor spillage. BOWE: He explained it all to his CO. His CO told him to report it to the intelligence officer. They counseled him, said, OK, well, you know, you shouldn't have done that. The NCIS concluded within a few months that, yes, technically there was a violation of the rules, but no action needed to be taken. LAWRENCE: Amid all the investigations into Brezler's handling of classified material, the warning he sent got lost. Seventeen days later in Helmand, one of Sarwar Jan's underaged servants grabbed an assault rifle and shot dead three unarmed Marines at the base gymnasium. BREZLER: I don't know if I've ever been so angry and so sad at the same moment in my life. I mean, this is precisely what we didn't want to happen. LAWRENCE: Brezler felt worse a few months later when he heard that the parents of one of the murdered Marines had no details about their son's death. They were asking help from their congressman, New York Republican Pete King. BREZLER: And it was at that point that I said to myself this isn't OK. And that family probably don't even really know this attack was in the preventible range. LAWRENCE: Brezler met with Congressman King, and King started pushing the issue, and that got some press. And that's when the U. S. Marine Corps got serious about investigating Jason Brezler. Here's Brezler's lawyer again. BOWE: Almost a year had gone by, and he had moved on, the Marine Corps had moved on. And then a new story comes out that reveals that he's talking to Congressman King about these murders. And three days later, he is sent to a board of inquiry to be kicked out of the Marine Corps. LAWRENCE: Bowe says there were hundreds of similar cases of spillage in the same year, and only two were punished. The inquiry was retaliation, he says, for embarrassing the Marine brass. A Pentagon inspector general report concluded it was not retaliation. BREZLER: On day three of the hearing, the BOI, the board recommended that I be separated with an honorable discharge. LAWRENCE: That's an honorable discharge - no real loss of benefits. Jason Brezler just wouldn't be a Marine anymore. BREZLER: A huge punch in the gut. In light of my very strong desire to continue to serve and lead Marines, it didn't feel honorable. LAWRENCE: A spokesman said the Marine Corps has confidence in legal and administrative processes against Jason Brezler but declined to comment further because the case is ongoing. Brezler sued in federal court to stay in the Marines. The case could go to trial this fall. Quil Lawrence, NPR News.

Four years ago, Brezler sent an urgent message to a fellow Marine in Afghanistan warning him about a threat. The warning was not heeded. And two weeks later, three U. S. troops were dead. Now, the Marine Corps is trying to kick Brezler out because the warning used classified information. NPR veterans correspondent Quil Lawrence has the story. QUIL LAWRENCE, BYLINE: Jason Brezler deployed four times, including a tour of urban combat in Fallujah. In 2010, he was at a remote base in Helmand, Afghanistan. The mission was to support Afghan forces against the Taliban. Brezler says his biggest problem was a corrupt local police chief. JASON BREZLER: Sarwar Jan - he was a threat to not only the Afghans but our own Marines. LAWRENCE: Sarwar Jan was maybe linked to the Taliban. He was also a pedophile who preyed on local boys, something alarmingly common among Afghan warlords. Recently, there's been a debate about whether U. S. forces should tolerate Afghan allies who keep kids at their barracks. Back in 2010, there was no policy. Brezler couldn't fire Sarwar Jan, but he could kick him off the base. BREZLER: We put Sarwar Jan on the next helicopter, and once he left, we could've probably had a parade the next day through the bazaar. The Afghans were absolutely elated. LAWRENCE: Brezler went home. In the summer of 2012, he was in the Marine Reserves and working as a Brooklyn firefighter. On the side, he was getting a master's degree. BREZLER: So I'm sitting at a conference table in Oklahoma taking, I believe, a public budgeting class, and I received an email, and the title was \"Sarwar Jan Is Back\" - all caps, exclamation point, exclamation point. LAWRENCE: It was a forwarded request for information from a Marine in Helmand. Sarwar Jan was living on a U. S. base again. He'd brought a small group of underage Afghan boys to serve him there. BREZLER: And my reaction, it was largely a visceral one. I was like, are you freaking kidding me? LAWRENCE: Brezler searched his laptop - it was the same one he'd had with him in Helmand - and he found the dossier on Sarwar Jan. He hit reply all and send. That set off a chain of consequences but not the one Brezler intended. MIKE BOWE: As soon as he sends it, and then the Marine on the other side in Afghanistan says, this is marked classified. LAWRENCE: That's Jason Brezler's lawyer, Mike Bowe. He sat in on our interview. BOWE: And so at the first break during class, he calls on his cellphone to his CO and he says, look, this is what just happened. So he self-reports right away like he's supposed to do. BREZLER: My boss, my battalion commander, who at that point professionally I had known for several years - we had served in Fallujah together at the height of the insurgency - and he said, all right, it sounds like minor spillage. BOWE: He explained it all to his CO. His CO told him to report it to the intelligence officer. They counseled him, said, OK, well, you know, you shouldn't have done that. The NCIS concluded within a few months that, yes, technically there was a violation of the rules, but no action needed to be taken. LAWRENCE: Amid all the investigations into Brezler's handling of classified material, the warning he sent got lost. Seventeen days later in Helmand, one of Sarwar Jan's underaged servants grabbed an assault rifle and shot dead three unarmed Marines at the base gymnasium. BREZLER: I don't know if I've ever been so angry and so sad at the same moment in my life. I mean, this is precisely what we didn't want to happen. LAWRENCE: Brezler felt worse a few months later when he heard that the parents of one of the murdered Marines had no details about their son's death. They were asking help from their congressman, New York Republican Pete King. BREZLER: And it was at that point that I said to myself this isn't OK. And that family probably don't even really know this attack was in the preventible range. LAWRENCE: Brezler met with Congressman King, and King started pushing the issue, and that got some press. And that's when the U. S. Marine Corps got serious about investigating Jason Brezler. Here's Brezler's lawyer again. BOWE: Almost a year had gone by, and he had moved on, the Marine Corps had moved on. And then a new story comes out that reveals that he's talking to Congressman King about these murders. And three days later, he is sent to a board of inquiry to be kicked out of the Marine Corps. LAWRENCE: Bowe says there were hundreds of similar cases of spillage in the same year, and only two were punished. The inquiry was retaliation, he says, for embarrassing the Marine brass. A Pentagon inspector general report concluded it was not retaliation. BREZLER: On day three of the hearing, the BOI, the board recommended that I be separated with an honorable discharge. LAWRENCE: That's an honorable discharge - no real loss of benefits. Jason Brezler just wouldn't be a Marine anymore. BREZLER: A huge punch in the gut. In light of my very strong desire to continue to serve and lead Marines, it didn't feel honorable. LAWRENCE: A spokesman said the Marine Corps has confidence in legal and administrative processes against Jason Brezler but declined to comment further because the case is ongoing. Brezler sued in federal court to stay in the Marines. The case could go to trial this fall. Quil Lawrence, NPR News.", "section": "National Security", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.

Fifteen years later, the war in Afghanistan has become this country's longest armed conflict. For many Americans, including the presidential candidates, it has also become the forgotten war. And yet, as NPR's David Welna reports, America's presence in Afghanistan is bound to continue no matter who becomes the next commander in chief. DAVID WELNA, BYLINE: On an early autumn Sunday afternoon in 2001, the U. S. was still in shock from the 9/11 attacks. That's when President George W. Bush announced another nation on the other side of the world had just come under fire. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)GEORGE W. BUSH: On my orders, the United States military has begun strikes against al-Qaida terrorist training camps and military installations of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan. WELNA: Fewer than five dozen Americans died in the campaign to overthrow the Taliban regime and chase al-Qaida into the mountains. Then, exactly a year to the day after invading Afghanistan, President Bush asked Congress to authorize invading Iraq. This, according to military historian Andrew Bacevich, was a clear signal the Bush administration had moved on from the war in Afghanistan. ANDREW BACEVICH: When we enjoyed the initial success of toppling the Taliban, they decided that the job was basically done. WELNA: But in 2008, a Democratic senator from Illinois running for the White House reminded Americans that al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden remained at large. (SOUNDBITE OF ARVHICED RECORDING)PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: And that is why, as president, I will make the fight against al-Qaida and the Taliban the top priority that it should be. This is a war we have to win. WELNA: Bacevich, whose latest book is \"America's War For The Greater Middle East,\" says via Skype that as the anti-Iraq war candidate, Barack Obama had to show he was not soft on matters of national security. BACEVICH: And one way to do that was to draw this contrast between the Iraq War, as the stupid war, with the Afghanistan War, which he described as the necessary war and which he vowed to win. WELNA: As president, Obama surged troop levels in Afghanistan and drew them down in Iraq. On his orders, U. S. forces captured and killed bin Laden. And nearly two years ago, Obama declared U. S. combat operations in Afghanistan over. But getting out of Afghanistan, which depends heavily on international support, has been a lot harder than getting in. Obama once planned to remove most of the nearly 10,000 U. S. troops left in Afghanistan by the end of this year. Then, last year, he said only about half of those troops would leave. This summer, calling that country's security situation precarious, Obama revised that figure once again. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)OBAMA: Instead of going down to 5,500 troops by the end of this year, the United States will maintain approximately 8,400 troops in Afghanistan into next year, through the end of my administration. WELNA: Meaning a war in which nearly 2,400 American service members have now died will continue into the next administration. But both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton seldom mention Afghanistan on the campaign trail. KAEL WESTON: The longest war in American history has been easy to push aside. WELNA: That's Kael Weston. He was posted in Afghanistan as a U. S. diplomat and writes about it in a new book, \"Mirror Test. \"WESTON: Our military has been told to go fight a very tough war and report back occasionally. And that has had consequences in an election year when other issues seem to be dominating the discussion. WELNA: Nearly a year ago, Trump deplored the invasion of Afghanistan when asked on CNN if he believed American boots should stay on the ground there. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)DONALD TRUMP: We made a terrible mistake getting involved there in the first place. We had real brilliant thinkers that didn't know what the hell they were doing. And it's a mess. It's a mess. WELNA: During a Republican debate on Fox News in March, Trump was asked about his terrible mistake comment. He claimed he'd meant Iraq not Afghanistan. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: I think you have to stay in Afghanistan for a while because of the fact that you're right next to Pakistan, which has nuclear weapons. WELNA: And shortly after Obama announced last year he'd be keeping thousands of troops in Afghanistan, Hillary Clinton was asked on CNN if she'd pledge those troops would be out by the end of her possible presidency. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)HILLARY CLINTON: I can't predict where things will be in January of 2017. But I support the president's decision. WELNA: The refusal by both candidates to pull the plug on Afghanistan reminds historian Bacevich of another war that would haunt three presidents - Vietnam. BACEVICH: It was painful indeed for the United States to extricate itself from Vietnam. But no politician up to this point is willing to make that same call with regard to Afghanistan.

Australia has placed some refugees on that island, vowing they will never be allowed into the country. RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: In recent weeks, we've heard their stories - refugees who have no idea of their future, a woman who attempted suicide, aid workers who said the abuse of refugees was effectively ignored. INSKEEP: Today we hear from Peter Dutton, who is Australia's Immigration Minister, who offers a reason for the policy his country has pursued since 2013. Australia, he says, wanted to stop refugees from coming and often dying on dangerous boat journeys. PETER DUTTON: I've spoken to the sailors on our boats, on our vessels who were pulling half-eaten bodies out of the water. Now, I don't want to return back to those days. And the fact that, in two years, we have not had one drowning at sea, I think that is something to be very proud of. INSKEEP: Dutton says that outcome is worth all of those stories of people left in permanent limbo, stories he plays down. DUTTON: This is where I think it's important to stick with the facts and not the emotion. There is a big body of argument, generally from the extreme left, in the Australian political debate that are completely opposed to strong border protection policies. So they advocate a position of effectively open borders. And as we said, as we're seeing in Europe, as you've experienced in the United States, we have to have. . . INSKEEP: I just have to stop you for one thing, Minister, to note that people use the phrase open borders in the U. S. political campaign, and it's completely inaccurate. Are you sure that open borders is actually the policy of your political opponents in Australia? DUTTON: This is what they advocate. And as I say, this is the extreme view of the argument, and they're very active on social media because, in the end, what they want to do is disrupt the policy that the government's implemented. And we're very keen to provide significant support to our two neighbors who are offering the regional processing centers. We have settlement packages that we offer to people to return back to the country of origin. So we have an absolute desire to treat people with dignity and respect. And in the end, though, people do want to come to Australia, and many of them resist any offers to go back to their country of origin, even when they've been found not to be refugees. INSKEEP: And some of them are found - in fact, most of them are found to be refugees, aren't they? DUTTON: Well, some of them certainly are, but we've been clear in saying that we are not going to take people off boats. We will take people in an orderly way. The United Nations points out that Australia is one of the leading countries in the world in terms of the amount of assistance that we provide to refugees. We want people to lead a dignified existence. But we've said we are not going to settle people under that situation. INSKEEP: What is the fear if you were to let some people into Australia this way? DUTTON: The fear is that the 50,000 would come again on 800 boats and we would have 1,200 hundred people drowning at sea. The image that people saw on the television screens of the little boy who died in the waters of the Mediterranean - that played out out 1,200 times. INSKEEP: As you know, there's been quite a lot of publicity about allegations of abuse, including sexual abuse of children, on the island of Nauru. I know you've disputed how many of these are serious, but you've also said that you will not tolerate any cases of sexual abuse. How many people have been prosecuted? DUTTON: Well, if you look at the report to which you make reference, there were 2,107 documents. Twenty-one - so 1 percent - were classified as critical, which includes, for example, an adult female disciplining her child. That was considered as a critical incident. Clearly, in my mind, that is not a critical incident. Now, there are a number of cases where some people have made complaints of sexual abuse. And when the police have investigated, they've withdrawn their complaints. Now, that may be for cultural reasons. It might be for other reasons. So there have been no prosecutions, but there have been investigations. Nobody wants to tolerate any instance of sexual abuse. Now, we will work with the Nauruan authorities to investigate matters, and we've provided significant support through Australian Federal Police and other agencies, significant amounts of Australian taxpayers' money to provide a humane environment on Nauru. But in the end, as the United Nations points out, there are 65 million people who are forcibly displaced and people who would want to come to a country like ours or yours tomorrow. And the intake system must be conducted in an orderly way, and that's what I intend to do as immigration and border protection minister. INSKEEP: We interviewed an Iranian refugee. We've got a document in front of us here stating that he's been certified as a refugee. He doesn't think that he can safely go back. He says he'd like to go to some other country, if he would be able to go to Canada or the United States or anywhere, but he doesn't really know how to do that. He's not allowed into Australia. He feels stuck there permanently, and his wife has attempted suicide - tried to hang herself. That's what he said. Are you comfortable with that outcome, given the policy imperatives that you've described? DUTTON: We already have one of the biggest intakes of refugees in the world, but the reality is that we provide a humane and safe environment for people. We do it in an orderly way. We don't do it in a way which is dictated to us by organized criminal syndicates who have taken money from people that want an outcome. But we can only provide as much support as we can. And we provide it in a record number and in a very significant way. And of that, Australia is very proud. INSKEEP: Minister Dutton, thanks very much for taking the time. Really appreciate it. DUTTON: Thanks, Steve, pleasure. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  We now have a defense of parking refugees on a remote Pacific island.

And in the end, though, people do want to come to Australia, and many of them resist any offers to go back to their country of origin, even when they've been found not to be refugees. INSKEEP: And some of them are found - in fact, most of them are found to be refugees, aren't they? DUTTON: Well, some of them certainly are, but we've been clear in saying that we are not going to take people off boats. We will take people in an orderly way. The United Nations points out that Australia is one of the leading countries in the world in terms of the amount of assistance that we provide to refugees. We want people to lead a dignified existence. But we've said we are not going to settle people under that situation. INSKEEP: What is the fear if you were to let some people into Australia this way? DUTTON: The fear is that the 50,000 would come again on 800 boats and we would have 1,200 hundred people drowning at sea. The image that people saw on the television screens of the little boy who died in the waters of the Mediterranean - that played out out 1,200 times. INSKEEP: As you know, there's been quite a lot of publicity about allegations of abuse, including sexual abuse of children, on the island of Nauru. I know you've disputed how many of these are serious, but you've also said that you will not tolerate any cases of sexual abuse. How many people have been prosecuted? DUTTON: Well, if you look at the report to which you make reference, there were 2,107 documents. Twenty-one - so 1 percent - were classified as critical, which includes, for example, an adult female disciplining her child. That was considered as a critical incident. Clearly, in my mind, that is not a critical incident. Now, there are a number of cases where some people have made complaints of sexual abuse. And when the police have investigated, they've withdrawn their complaints. Now, that may be for cultural reasons. It might be for other reasons. So there have been no prosecutions, but there have been investigations. Nobody wants to tolerate any instance of sexual abuse. Now, we will work with the Nauruan authorities to investigate matters, and we've provided significant support through Australian Federal Police and other agencies, significant amounts of Australian taxpayers' money to provide a humane environment on Nauru. But in the end, as the United Nations points out, there are 65 million people who are forcibly displaced and people who would want to come to a country like ours or yours tomorrow. And the intake system must be conducted in an orderly way, and that's what I intend to do as immigration and border protection minister. INSKEEP: We interviewed an Iranian refugee. We've got a document in front of us here stating that he's been certified as a refugee. He doesn't think that he can safely go back. He says he'd like to go to some other country, if he would be able to go to Canada or the United States or anywhere, but he doesn't really know how to do that. He's not allowed into Australia. He feels stuck there permanently, and his wife has attempted suicide - tried to hang herself. That's what he said. Are you comfortable with that outcome, given the policy imperatives that you've described? DUTTON: We already have one of the biggest intakes of refugees in the world, but the reality is that we provide a humane and safe environment for people. We do it in an orderly way. We don't do it in a way which is dictated to us by organized criminal syndicates who have taken money from people that want an outcome. But we can only provide as much support as we can. And we provide it in a record number and in a very significant way. And of that, Australia is very proud. INSKEEP: Minister Dutton, thanks very much for taking the time. Really appreciate it.

S. and Syria are all up in the air. That's after a U. S. coalition airstrike hit Bashar al-Assad's forces in eastern Syria killing at least 62 and wounding dozens more. For more on the story, we turn now to NPR's Pentagon correspondent Tom Bowman. Tom, thanks so much for joining us. TOM BOWMAN, BYLINE: Sure. Good to be here. MARTIN: So exactly what happened and how could this have happened? BOWMAN: Well, that's what the Pentagon is trying to find out. An investigation has started, of course. Now, military officials say U. S. and coalition warplanes were targeting what they thought were Islamic State forces in an area around the town of Deir ez-Zor. Now, they said they'd been watching this location for days, and right before the strike, they called the Russians and said, hey, we'll be bombing in this area. The Russians said simply, thank you, according to a military official I spoke with. Then they launched the airstrikes, and they hit a tank and a half dozen vehicles. Twenty five minutes into this attack, the Russians called and said you're bombing Syrian troops, and the attacks stopped. Now, the question is - you're right. How could this possibly have happened? The U. S. uses sophisticated means for hitting a target. There's a drone surveillance, sometimes intercepts of phone or radio conversation to make sure they have the right target. So this is clearly a massive intelligence bungle. In the past, you know, my time in Iraq or Afghanistan, you may see a mistake hitting a wedding party or friendly forces, but the scale of this is unusual - dozens dead and wounded. Now it also comes at a particularly bad time. There was a cease-fire worked out with Secretary of State John Kerry and his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov. And as part of that deal, the Syrians were not supposed to fly any combat missions against rebels. Humanitarian aid was supposed to flow to hundreds of thousands of stranded Syrians, and the U. S. and Russia was supposed to coordinate bombing runs against both the Islamic State and al-Qaida. And that was supposed to start on Monday. MARTIN: You know, you've given us what we know so far about the U. S. officials' account of what occurred. Have we heard from either the Russians or the Syrians about this? BOWMAN: Well, the Russians have basically said, listen, you guys never wanted this coordination center anyway, you know, there was tensions within the U. S. government. The White House was pushing - or the State Department. The Pentagon was dragging its feet. They didn't want it. So the Russians are saying, you guys, you know, never wanted this anyway. What the Syrians are saying is, listen, you don't want Bashar al-Assad, our leader, to stay in power. You're basically serving as the air force of the Islamic State. So they don't buy that it was a mistake. They think it was actually intentional. MARTIN: Does this signal the end of this week-old cease-fire? Is it being viewed that way? BOWMAN: Well, the Russians say it's very shaky at this point, and that's going to be the big question into this week. Now, again, the cease-fire wasn't doing all that well anyway. The - there was still fighting between the Syrians and the rebels, and there was supposed to be that movement of humanitarian aid, food, water and medicine. That has yet to flow. So it was all pretty questionable anyway. Now we have no sense of the way ahead. Again, the Russians are complaining about it and so are the Syrians. So we'll just have to see starting this week whether they can put this back together again. That's very questionable. MARTIN: Finally, world leaders are gathering at the UN General Assembly meeting in New York this week. I imagine this would be a big part of the conversation. BOWMAN: Absolutely it will be. And there's already a meeting of the UN Security Council on Saturday called by the Russians, and Russian officials sharply criticized the U. S. And the American UN Ambassador Samantha Power criticized the Russians for calling the meeting saying it was a stunt. And the Russians said of Samantha Power, you're being pretty heavy-handed here. So very undiplomatic talk at the UN from the Russians and the Americans. It really smacked of the Cold War. So you're right. The president will be at the UN this week. And clearly this will be a huge topic of discussion. MARTIN: That's NPR Pentagon correspondent Tom Bowman. Tom, thank you. BOWMAN: You're welcome.

This week, world leaders will come together for the annual general assembly debate, and Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon is planning to use this time to make a big push to bring the climate deal into force. As NPR's Michele Kelemen reports, he's getting close. MICHELE KELEMEN, BYLINE: U. N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon is in a race against time to get the Paris climate change agreement into force before the end of his term and before a new U. S. president gets to the White House. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)SECRETARY-GENERAL BAN KI-MOON: I'm using every opportunity to push for the early entry into force of the Paris agreement before the end of this year. KELEMEN: Ban needs at least 55 countries representing 55 percent of climate change emissions, to formally join the deal for it to go into effect. And the secretary-general is asking as many countries as possible to deliver their letters of ratification at a ceremony this Wednesday in New York. One of his aides on this, Selwin Hart, says it's been remarkable to see how quickly countries are moving through complicated political debates at home. SELWIN HART: It usually takes years and sometimes decades (laughter) - and sometimes never - for major international agreements like this to cross these thresholds that have been put in place and enter into force. KELEMEN: Hart is expecting about 20 countries to join on Wednesday, bringing the total close to 50. The recent decision by the two largest greenhouse gas emitters, the U. S. and China, to join added momentum. And Secretary of State John Kerry continues to rally other countries, says Assistant Secretary of State Bethsheba Crocker. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)ASST SEC OF STATE SHEBA CROCKER: The secretary and numerous other U. S. government officials are talking all the time to other counterparts in other governments to try to encourage other countries to sign up this year so that, hopefully, the agreement will come into force this year. KELEMEN: Why the rush? In part, the U. S. election calendar is driving this. While Democrat Hillary Clinton has been on board with the Paris agreement, Republican Donald Trump has said he would walk away from it. If the Paris climate change agreement goes into force by the end of the year, the U. S. technically wouldn't be able to withdraw from its commitments for four years, almost the duration of the next president's term. And a top adviser to the U. N. secretary-general on climate change, Robert Orr, says with American businesses invested in this, it will be hard for even Trump to back out. ROBERT ORR: The movement in the world is towards lower carbon intensity economies is accelerating rapidly, and the U. S. can't afford to lose in this race, or its economy and its jobs will suffer. KELEMEN: Orr, who is dean of the University of Maryland School of Public Policy, says this is part of the success of the deal. He says the secretary-general managed to bring in businesses, banks and others who recognize the dangers of climate change and see opportunities in renewable energy and other low-carbon industries. ORR: The real world has entered the negotiating room, which left no room for negotiators to continue to dawdle. And that is a huge legacy for Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. Mobilizing those forces made the achievement and the Paris agreement possible. It will also make the implementation of the Paris agreement possible. KELEMEN: Orr describes it as a race to the top. A global competition for industries to become more efficient and competitive. And he argues, if America aspires to remain a global superpower, this is one area where it must lead.

The U. S. has been supporting opposition forces trying to unseat President Bashar al-Assad. Russia has been supporting Assad's regime. The cease-fire agreement happened because the U. S. and Russia decided to work together and coordinate airstrikes against ISIS in Syria. But then yesterday, a U. S. -led airstrike that was supposed to target the Islamic State instead hit some of Bashar al-Assad's forces. Russia then accused the U. S. of actually supporting ISIS. Russia also said they'd call an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council. It's a complicated situation with serious consequences for the region. To talk more, we're joined by Liz Sly of The Washington Post. She's been following developments from Beirut, and she joins us via Skype. Liz, thanks so much for being with us. LIZ SLY: Thank you. MARTIN: What more can you tell us about how this airstrike on Syrian government troops happened? This is a grave mistake. SLY: Well, yes, we don't really know many details about how it happened. First of all, we had an allegation from the Syrian government. Then we had a very angry statement from the Russians saying that this strike had killed over 60 Syrian soldiers. Then we heard from the Pentagon, which said it had called off a strike in that area at the location mentioned after receiving telephone calls from Russia to say these are Syrian troops, stop bombing. They called off the strike. Now, they did say that they had informed Russia in advance about this location of the strike. They said that - hit it before, that ISIS has been there before. Apparently, the front lines had moved and the Pentagon didn't know the front lines had moved. MARTIN: So it took so long to craft this cease-fire agreement. It was very fragile from the get-go. Now what are the odds that the cease-fire will hold after this strike? SLY: Well, it's looking very, very shaky indeed. I don't think anybody ever held out much hope that this cease-fire was going to work. It really wasn't premised on any solution to the Syrian war. It was premised more on U. S. -Russian cooperation than it is about events on the ground in Syria. And neither site on the ground is particularly interested in cooperation, so all of them are very skeptical about the cease-fire in the first place. And this strike has come at an extremely inopportune time. We're supposed to start the U. S. -Russian cooperation tomorrow. Instead we have probably got huge amounts of diplomatic traffic between Moscow and Washington trying to unravel this mess that has occurred, and the cease-fire itself has sort of gone by the by. MARTIN: What does this mean for the humanitarian crisis? I mean, the cease-fire was in essence supposed to give U. N. aid workers in particular the opportunity to finally get supplies in, especially to Aleppo, where the devastation has been so severe. SLY: Well, this was why we could already see that the cease-fire wasn't working because the terms of the deal were that there would be a pause in fighting for seven days during which aid would flow unimpeded to these areas and especially Aleppo. Now, on the fifth day of that, which was yesterday, we still hadn't seen any aid move, so the cease-fire already wasn't working. Now, last night at the U. N. the Russian ambassador said, oh, it was going to move this morning. It was all ready to move. But now we don't know if it will. But you don't know whether it would have or not because they haven't done it in the past five days. So that key plank of the cease-fire had already basically gone.

He writes, (reading) no rose will complain of excessive petal-droop in a still life. No cheese will take you to task over inaccurate veining. But portraiture is answerable as no other specialty to something lying beyond the artist's creativity. That something is the sitter paying the bill. Schama, who is a professor of both history and art history, has written 500 often very entertaining pages called \"The Face Of Britain. \"It's about the faces immortalized in Britain's National Portrait Gallery and the stories behind the paintings. Simon Schama, welcome, once again. SIMON SCHAMA: Thank you, Robert. SIEGEL: First, after your immersion in hundreds of portraits, people who knew power, love, fame, notoriety, what essential truth about the portrait did you come away with? SCHAMA: Well, I think it has an extraordinary power beyond its beginnings in vanity or self-congratulation. All portraits are really, or most of them, are triangular relationships because quite apart from a person saying, now, do me at my finest and the artist saying, we'll see about that, sunshine, there is the public - people other than you who'll be looking at it. So very unusually for a work of art, it's an active collaboration. And things can go swimmingly. That collaboration can produce a kind of enriched image of truly hypnotic power or things can go terribly wrong. SIEGEL: One of my favorite chapters in your book is the one devoted to David Garrick, the 18th century Shakespearean actor - such a Shakespearean you call him a Bardolater - and especially the painting of him playing Richard III, the painting by William Hogarth. How important was Garrick as a public figure? SCHAMA: Garrick was extraordinary because he was an overnight star. And the word star was actually used for the very first time. And the public, who had been used to watching Shakespeare being declaimed in a very grandly portentous kind of way, were very surprised to see this small man, this very nimble, athletic man, apparently speak the lines of something as grandly rhetorical as Richard III. So Garrick himself had the sense in which if he was going to make it as a young man, he needed people to know who he was as a personality. So he went into partnership with a brilliant artist who had a very strong sense of theater, William Hogarth. And before long, there was an enormous painting of Garrick at an extraordinary moment, the moment of Richard III's comeuppance, when he has a bad night and is visited by the ghosts of his many victims. And it was all very well to do this as an extraordinary, huge painting, much bigger than anything else Hogarth did. Hogarth always knew that it was going to become a print. And once you put that star moment into a print, it could circulate all around the country. And Garrick became, overnight, a sensation. And it was due entirely to the manufacture of his portrayed image. SIEGEL: You write this wonderful description of David Garrick's eyebrows. You write, (reading) one more arched than the other, they were themselves a theater company of two, those eyebrows - tragedy and comedy, sorrow and slapstick, dancing on the stage of his face. SCHAMA: Yes, it was one of my more understated passages. . . (LAUGHTER)SCHAMA: . . . As usual. It's a subject so rich that you do, as a writer, dangerously fall in love both with artist and with the portrayed. And there is something very odd and paradoxical. We think of sitting for the portrait as a torment, that you have to sit still. And as you sit still, of course, your face and your body freezes. So actually, the challenge for a really great artist who wants to embody vitality, and it was essential in the story we've been talking about, in Garrick, is somehow to unfreeze that personality, to unlock it from a kind of rictus position. That really does bring out the best, actually, whether it's a photographer or a painter. The picture of Churchill that everybody out there, I think, knows, the bulldog warrior scowling - right? - was actually taken by an extraordinary photographer in Canada. Churchill did not want to have his photograph taken. He'd just given a long speech to the Canadian Parliament in the middle of the war. He was ill and he was tired. He comes into a room at the end of the speech. And the photographer goes over to Churchill and does something extraordinary. He takes the lit cigar out of Churchill's mouth. And that produced the famous look of bulldog fury. And as I say, we think of this as the expression of a man who is determined to see the war through to the end. But it was actually the expression of a man who's had his cigar confiscated. SIEGEL: (Laughter) This was the photographer Yousuf. . . SCHAMA: Yes. SIEGEL: . . . Karsh who did that. But you begin your book, actually, with the description of a portrait that does not and cannot hang in the National Portrait Gallery in London because it doesn't exist anymore. And this was. . . SCHAMA: You're giving the game away. Yes, but that's all right. It doesn't. . . SIEGEL: Graham Sutherland's 1954 portrait of Winston Churchill 13 years later. He's been prime minister twice. He's going to be honored by this grand portrait. He sits for one of the trendiest painters in Britain and. . . SCHAMA: Yes, Graham Sutherland. It's his 80th birthday. It's going to be the moment when the nation, in the shape of Parliament, is going to thank him for saving the country during the war. And Parliament indeed picks this fashionable and rather brilliant portraitist. And then they have a kind of testy relationship. It's a testy relationship because Churchill, you'll remember, is himself a painter. So Churchill thinks of it as a partnership. But he has certain political issues that are desperately important to him. Unbeknownst to the country, he'd had a stroke a few months before. And because he had a stroke, his own party, the Conservatives, were very keen to get him out of the door in time for the next election. Churchill accepted but he kept on thinking of reasons why he didn't want to go. So when portrait time happened, he wanted a version of himself where he was still in the full prime of his veteran power - an old man but a perpetually energetic man. And what he got from Sutherland, as became quickly apparent, was a portrait of a magnificent ruin, as I say. And he said, I don't want this presented to me. But the ceremony had to go ahead. And it was a shocking moment. Churchill very stagily got his revenge by facing this huge audience, a television audience as well as the audience in Westminster Hall, and saying, this is a very remarkable example - heavy pause - of modern art. And everybody fell about laughing except for the poor artists, who felt destroyed by the moment. SIEGEL: Modern art, at the moment, not a positive or even neutral phrase. . . SCHAMA: That's right, Churchill knew exactly what he was doing. But this wasn't good enough because when the portrait was given to the family, it was not long before they put it on a bonfire and burnt it. SIEGEL: So what you have is a picture, a photograph. . . SCHAMA: We have a slide. . . SIEGEL: . . . Of the painting. . . SCHAMA: We have a slide, which, for me, shows that it was - if it had survived, it would have been one of the grandest and most expressive and moving portraits ever done of a statesman, I think. SIEGEL: Simon Schama, thank you very much for talking. SCHAMA: It's a pleasure. SIEGEL: Simon Schama's book is called \"The Face Of Britain: The Nation Through Its Portraits. \" ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:  Portraiture, according to Simon Schama, is the least free of painterly genres. He writes, (reading) no rose will complain of excessive petal-droop in a still life. No cheese will take you to task over inaccurate veining. But portraiture is answerable as no other specialty to something lying beyond the artist's creativity. That something is the sitter paying the bill. Schama, who is a professor of both history and art history, has written 500 often very entertaining pages called \"The Face Of Britain. \" It's about the faces immortalized in Britain's National Portrait Gallery and the stories behind the paintings. Simon Schama, welcome, once again. SIMON SCHAMA: Thank you, Robert. SIEGEL: First, after your immersion in hundreds of portraits, people who knew power, love, fame, notoriety, what essential truth about the portrait did you come away with? SCHAMA: Well, I think it has an extraordinary power beyond its beginnings in vanity or self-congratulation. All portraits are really, or most of them, are triangular relationships because quite apart from a person saying, now, do me at my finest and the artist saying, we'll see about that, sunshine, there is the public - people other than you who'll be looking at it. So very unusually for a work of art, it's an active collaboration. And things can go swimmingly. That collaboration can produce a kind of enriched image of truly hypnotic power or things can go terribly wrong.

And today, the assembled world leaders hear from their host. President Obama has defined U. S. foreign policy for almost eight years now, both by what he's done and what he chose not to do. His legacy ranges from an international climate deal to the Syrian civil war. Now, Obama addresses the U. N. General Assembly one more time. NPR's Scott Horsley reports. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Aides say President Obama has used his annual meetings at the General Assembly to deal with international crises of the moment and to pursue an agenda for U. S. engagement with the rest of the world. There are crises aplenty this year, including the ongoing terror threat posed by ISIS and nuclear saber-rattling from North Korea. But Derek Chollet, who served under Obama at both the State Department and the Pentagon, argues the U. S. is better positioned to deal with such challenges thanks to Obama's patient engagement throughout his time in office. DEREK CHOLLET: I contend that by almost every measurement we are better off today than we were eight years ago. That's not to discount the turmoil in the world. But the question is what the U. S. can do about it. HORSLEY: Chollet argues the U. S. has done a lot under Obama, such as brokering the Iran nuclear deal, combating the Ebola virus in West Africa and restoring diplomatic ties with Cuba. But Obama's legacy is also defined by areas where he's resisted action. The president famously summarizes his cautious approach as don't do stupid stuff and Chollet, who's now defense and security adviser at The German Marshall Fund think tank, says that takes discipline when even some of the president's own advisers are clamoring for more action. CHOLLET: He is willing to buck the trend - what sometimes passes for the conventional wisdom - in service of what a long-term strategy is, and that's of course what successful presidents have to do. HORSLEY: The most glaring example is Syria where Obama initially resisted calls to arm the rebels battling President Bashar al-Assad and later backed down from his own threat to retaliate for Assad's use of chemical weapons. Obama has used drone strikes and special forces aggressively to target suspected terrorist overseas, including Osama bin Laden. But he's been wary of large scale military involvement. That's partly a reaction to what he sees as the mistakes of the George W. Bush administration. But editor David Rothkopf of Foreign Policy magazine worries Obama has over learned that lesson. DAVID ROTHKOPF: I think the president viewed his mandate as getting us out of Iraq and getting us out of Afghanistan and not getting us into any more wars. What we have seen is if you get out too fast, that creates a void, which contributed to the rise of ISIS. If you don't get in, we have seen some others who have opportunistically gotten involved and made the situation worse. HORSLEY: Conservative critics go further, saying Obama's reluctance to engage militarily against adversaries like Assad has emboldened other leaders, like Russia's Vladimir Putin and China's Xi Jinping. Here's former Vice President Dick Cheney speaking last year on CNN. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)DICK CHENEY: We got the Chinese on the march in Southeast Asia. We've got Russia on the march in Europe. We've got ISIS and the caliphate established now in the Middle East. We think the threats against the United States are as great as any time since the end of World War II. HORSLEY: Obama's defenders are not persuaded that a more aggressive U. S. posture in Syria would have made the situation there any better. What it would have done, they argue, is sap the energy from every other piece of the president's foreign policy agenda. Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes made that case on \"The Axe File\" podcast. (SOUNDBITE OF PODCAST, \"THE AXE FILES\")BEN RHODES: What the president has done is he has refused to allow his presidency to be dragged into the quicksand of the Middle East. And in doing so, he's found enormous opportunities that are going to transform the standing of the United States in the world. HORSLEY: Supporters point to the Paris climate agreement, which Obama spearheaded in partnership with China's Xi. And they say the administration's diplomatic opening to Cuba has paved the way for improved relations throughout the Western Hemisphere. One of the president's top foreign policy priorities has been the effort to raise America's profile in the fast-growing Asia Pacific region. But a central piece of that effort, a 12-nation trade deal, could be jeopardized by political opposition here at home. The White House warns if Congress fails to pass the trade deal, U. S. credibility in Asia would suffer a serious blow. Obama told reporters last week, he's not giving up. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: The reason that I'm pushing this so hard is because I know and other countries know and China know that if we get this done, advantage America. And if we don't, then we're going to be disadvantaged for a long time to come. HORSLEY: Because much of the president's foreign policy is crafted with an eye on the long term, it doesn't necessarily lend itself to scorekeeping at a convenient eight-year interval. But Chollet, the former administration official, thinks historians will view this president more favorably than many foreign policy observers do today. CHOLLET: Often it takes historical hindsight to appreciate the avoidance of mistakes. And, you know, President Obama certainly has made some mistakes, but I think he's avoided a lot. HORSLEY: Even as he's tried to focus on the long term, though, Obama's been repeatedly tripped up by crises of the moment. And some, like the Syrian civil war, now in its sixth year, turn out to have lasting consequences of their own. Scott Horsley, NPR News.

At a United Nations summit on Monday, nations did not commit to resettle millions of refugees. Meeting with President Obama on Tuesday, a selection of world leaders and corporate executives did make some commitments. NPR's Deborah Amos is covering all this in New York. Deborah, good morning. DEBORAH AMOS, BYLINE: Good morning. INSKEEP: What did the president do? AMOS: Well, this was a high priority for the White House after Obama has been criticized for not taking in Syrian refugees. INSKEEP: Yeah. AMOS: Everybody had to pledge before they could get into the room. Some are going to double resettlement. There's more money for humanitarian aid. The private sector added a half a billion dollars - this is companies like Microsoft, Goldman Sachs, LinkedIn. But Obama had a loftier goal to build empathy for refugees. There was a catch in his voice when he talked about that iconic picture of that dazed 5-year-old from Aleppo, Syria - he was wiping blood from his hands in the back of an ambulance. So Obama talked about a letter he got from Alex, an American boy who offered to share his bike and his home. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: We will give him a family, and he will be our brother. Those are the words of a 6-year-old boy. He teaches us a lot. (APPLAUSE)INSKEEP: Deborah, this sounds impressive, but I'm just doing some math in my head. You said the private sector contributed - said they'd contribute half a billion dollars - sounds great. You divide it by the number of refugees in the world - it's not even $10 a refugee. What can the private sector do with something this vast? AMOS: You're right. It is vast. But there's some interesting innovations - having educational courses on your cell phone, pledges of jobs. There's a Texas company making handbags that say 90 percent of the workforce will be refugees. Here's another approach offered by Bruce Cohen. He's co-founder of Talent Beyond Boundaries. He's working on a database. Now, he's got about 2,500 work resumes from Syrian refugees just in Lebanon. And here's what he said. BRUCE COHEN: It seemed obvious to us that somebody should be matching skilled and talented with opportunities, project, places in the world where there are skill gaps. The refugee population includes many skilled people - engineers, nurses, IT professionals, teachers. AMOS: Now, Cohen talked about hundreds of, for example, skilled Syrian nurses who are now refugees. His expectation is job placements, maybe in Africa, Latin America, Australia. This is all in the early stages. There's lots of details to work out. But his idea is that many highly educated refugees would jump at the chance of a work visa rather than waiting a long time for resettlement. INSKEEP: And lots of people observing this have noticed not only that refugees have skills, but a lot of countries have a deficit of skills or they're being depopulated and could use extra populations. How much is this summit going to do, really, to match up countries that would possibly like incoming residents with refugees? AMOS: There was lots of new ideas. The president says you can't keep doing the same old things in a crisis this large. He's been very late to address it. His farewell speech at the U. N. - this is all about wars and violence. You know, that is the anguishing challenge for this administration, for example, in Syria. If you can't stop the wars, you can't stop this huge mass migration crisis.

The president says you can't keep doing the same old things in a crisis this large. He's been very late to address it. His farewell speech at the U. N. - this is all about wars and violence. You know, that is the anguishing challenge for this administration, for example, in Syria. If you can't stop the wars, you can't stop this huge mass migration crisis. INSKEEP: Dealing with symptoms rather than the cause because that's the situation they're in. Deborah, thanks very much. AMOS: Thank you.

In New York today he addressed the United Nations General Assembly, and he talked about the nuclear deal that began this year. But for two British men, better relations would mean freedom for their loved ones. They came to New York to lobby for the release of family members imprisoned in Iran. NPR's Michele Kelemen has more. MICHELE KELEMEN, BYLINE: President Hassan Rouhani is trying to cash in on the nuclear deal and show the Iranian people the economic benefits of this diplomacy. Speaking through an interpreter, he told the U. N. General Assembly that Iran is a good place to invest. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT HASSAN ROUHANI: (Through interpreter) Only eight months after the removal of the cruel nuclear-related sanctions, the economy of Iran is showing clear improvement. KELEMEN: But a young British man, Richard Ratcliffe, says hardliners in Iran seem to be trying to undercut Rouhani, and he says his Iranian-born wife is a victim in this power struggle. She was arrested six months ago, and their 2-year-old daughter had her passport seized and is staying with her grandparents. RICHARD RATCLIFFE: His government is trying to build positive relations and improve things with the West. I mean, you know, taking a mother and a baby in this way just so gets in the way. And I mean it's shameful. KELEMEN: His wife, Nazanin Zaghari, works for the Thomson Reuters Foundation which trained journalists, though Ratcliffe says she wasn't working in Iran, just visiting her parents as she did often. And she was just sentenced by a secretive Iranian court to five years in prison. RATCLIFFE: I think she's a bargaining chip. There's been a foreigner taken every month since March. She was one of them. KELEMEN: In January the U. S. negotiated a prisoner exchange agreement with Iran to free several Iranian-Americans, though several more have been arrested since then. The U. S. also cleared longstanding Iranian financial claims in what looked to many critics like a ransom payment. British Prime Minister Theresa May raised Ratcliffe's case and others when she met President Rouhani here at the U. N. this week. British officials say Iran is holding five British-Iranian dual nationals. One of them is the father of Kamran Faroughi. KAMRAN FAROUGHI: We have no family in Tehran. We're all living in London. And he hasn't seen his wife, children, and grandchildren for well over five years. KELEMEN: His father, Kamal Faroughi, was working for a Malaysian energy company when he was arrested and convicted of espionage, and his son has come to the U. N. three years in a row to press his case. FAROUGHI: It's become very urgent because a few weeks ago he was diagnosed with cataracts. He needs an urgent operation to avoid blindness. This is a very standard operation that can be done very quickly. But the longer you - we leave it, the more likely it is that he will go blind. KELEMEN: His father is 77 years old. Ratcliffe is worried, too, about the health of his 37-year-old wife. She was too frail to pick up their daughter in one of the family visits this year, and the rare phone calls he's had with her have been tough. RATCLIFFE: She was deeply, deeply sad the previous phone call - like, desolate. But actually this time she was angry, which is a sign of being a bit stronger. So she was angry with the British government. She was angry with me, asked what was I doing. There was some fight in her, which, you know, I'm - yeah, I'm grateful that there's still some spirit. KELEMEN: He and Faroughi are meeting as many diplomats as they can to try to press their case, but so far President Rouhani is said to be stonewalling when he's asked why so many dual nationals who could be helping Iran open up to the West are instead languishing in jail.

In 1978, he kidnapped a South Korean actress and her movie director husband and forced them to work for him. A new documentary tells that story. NPR's Neda Ulaby spoke with one of the filmmakers. ROSS ADAM: It's just too bizarre to be real. NEDA ULABY, BYLINE: Ross Adam is one of the two directors who tracked down actress Choi Eun-hee. Now she's nearly 90 years old. In the documentary she remembers getting lured to Hong Kong with an offer to star in a movie. (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"THE LOVERS AND THE DESPOT\")CHOI EUN-HEE: (Through interpreter) There was no reason to be suspicious. ULABY: Choi went to visit a home by the sea she thought was owned by a producer. (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"THE LOVERS AND THE DESPOT\")CHOI: (Through interpreter) There was a speedboat with three or four strong men. All of a sudden a guy grabbed me by the arms. Before I knew it, I was onboard. All the blood drained from my head to my toes. ULABY: Choi was drugged and dragged to North Korea. She awoke as a captive of Kim Jong Il. (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"THE LOVERS AND THE DESPOT\")CHOI: (Through interpreter) He had a projection room in every house so he could watch movies any time. Having seen very many movies, he wanted North Korea cinema to be just that great. But he thought his comrades were too simple. To me, he seems like an artist who loved films. ULABY: And he intrigued documentary directors Robert Cannan and Ross Adam. ADAM: We're equally terrified but also attracted to dictators and their inner world and their particular kind of ego. ULABY: Kim Jong Il's ego is captured secretly on tape by the actress as he complained about North Korea's underwhelming film industry. (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"THE LOVERS AND THE DESPOT\")KIM JONG IL: (Through interpreter) Why do all of our films have the same ideological plots? There's nothing new about them. Why are there so many crying scenes? All of our films have crying scenes. This isn't a funeral, is it? ULABY: It's compelling to hear Kim Jong Il's voice partly because we think of him as a powerful visual icon. SUK-YOUNG KIM: Wearing his glasses, wearing this ridiculous Maoist suit.

(SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"THE LOVERS AND THE DESPOT\")KIM: (Through interpreter) Let's show the West what we are capable of. ULABY: Over the course of eight years, Kim Jong Il forced his pet actress and her director husband, Shin Sang-ok, to make nearly 20 films - historical traumas, martial arts movies, even a North Korean version of \"Godzilla\" and more, as actress Choi Eun-Hee says in the film. (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"THE LOVERS AND THE DESPOT\")CHOI: (Through interpreter) In North Korea, there were no love stories. Films were about loyalty, dedication and hard work. But we made the first love story in North Korean history. ULABY: After these movies made their way to film festivals mostly behind the Iron Curtain, Kim Jong Il started allowing the couple to travel. ADAM: Shin and Choi were his prize toys, and he wanted to show them off to the world. ULABY: Director Ross Adams says in 1986 at a film festival in Austria, the two escaped to the U. S. Embassy. But even though Choi and Shin escaped their captor, some people wondered how the director in particular had ended up in his clutches to begin with. KIM: Like many South Koreans, I have my doubts about Shin's true motivation to go to North Korea. ULABY: Professor Suk-Young Kim says Shin was a rebel, a political dissident in South Korea. And although he was then its most celebrated filmmaker, his movies had started to be censored by the military government. Some believe he defected to North Korea on purpose. Shin died in 2006 and the whole story may never be known. But coming to it as outsiders was useful, says British documentary director Ross Adam. ADAM: We had no kind of ulterior motives or no preconceptions about the story. We were going to approach it with an open mind. ULABY: And that's apparent, says film professor Suk-Young Kim. She's seen lots of interviews with the documentary's only surviving main character, actress Choi Eun-Hee, but this one felt surprisingly honest. KIM: There was depth to it. I mean you could really hear what she was going through. (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"THE LOVERS AND THE DESPOT\")CHOI: (Speaking Korean). KIM: Choi Eun-Hee says it so well. There's acting for film, and there's acting for life. And in North Korea, those could be one and the same thing. ULABY: Suk-Young Kim says North Korea remains a highly cinematic society, a stage set of sorts for another dictator obsessed with spectacle and drama. In that way, the documentary \"The Lovers And The Despot\" is a movie about a movie, she says, but one whose unwilling actors will mostly never escape. Neda Ulaby, NPR News.

I'm Dave Davies in for Terry Gross. In 2009, the largest American diplomatic mission in the world was in Kabul, Afghanistan, where the U. S. embassy's budget of $4 billion was four times the country's domestic income. President Obama was sending more troops and civilian personnel to reverse alarming gains the Taliban had made. And so much cash was flowing into the country that President Hamid Karzai's chief of staff had a money counting machine in his office. Those are some details in a new book from our guest, Washington Post foreign correspondent Joshua Partlow. Partlow was in Afghanistan from 2009 to 2012, and his account of those years is a story of government dysfunction, rampant corruption and increasing civilian hostility to American military operations. Partlow looks at the Afghanistan experience through the prism of the Karzai family, the president and his brothers, many educated in America, who became important players in the political strife, corruption and violence in the country. Besides his tour in Afghanistan, Joshua Partlow has done reporting in Iraq and Latin America. He's now The Washington Post's Mexico bureau chief. His book is \"A Kingdom Of Their Own: The Family Karzai And The Afghan Disaster. \"Well, Joshua Partlow, welcome to FRESH AIR. This is a big family, an influential family in Afghanistan. It includes Hamid Karzai, the president, but many others. You know, we have famous political families in this country. I mean, the Taft's going way back, the Kennedys, probably the most famous. Tell us about this family and why you wanted to focus on them. JOSHUA PARTLOW: This was the family who was in charge in Afghanistan and was involved in all aspects of Afghanistan when I arrived in the summer of 2009, just before President Hamid Karzai's election to his second term. And they had - they had come to define the decade-long war at that point. And they would be in power in the years that followed as well. And they had - they struck me just as a fascinating and frustrating and intriguing family, I mean, starting with the president himself. He was full of contradictions. He was the commander in chief at a time when the U. S. military had 100,000 troops in Afghanistan and yet he was - had these pacifistic tendencies. He was - he was extremely sensitive to violence. He would cry in public. He was - he had started the war in 2001 as a pro-American Muslim leader, and he had become the greatest critic of the U. S. military's presence in Afghanistan. And he was, you know, the leading figure in this family that had enriched itself during the course of the war, and yet he had these tendencies to live a very humble life. And he'd scorned material wealth, and he changed the way the palace was run in order to have things more plain and more simple. So I was intrigued by all these factors and wanted to explore this family more deeply. DAVIES: I want to talk about some of his brothers and half-brothers who played really important roles in Afghanistan. But speaking generally, it's - what's one of the fascinating things is that these brothers, when the Soviets invaded in 1979, many of them made their ways - their way to the United States and had careers then. You want to just give us a little bit of a picture of these brothers and where they were in America? PARTLOW: Yeah. The family was scattered by the Soviet war in Afghanistan in the 1980s. Some people, like Hamid Karzai, moved to Pakistan and got involved in the resistance to the Soviet war in Afghanistan, working with the mujahedeen groups. And others moved to the United States and had completely different careers. Qayum Karzai was the first to arrive here. He was an elder brother, and he came on an Afghan air force program and trained in U. S. military bases in Oklahoma and then got airsick and realized being a pilot wasn't for him. And he scraped money together and drove a car cross-country and ended up in Washington, D. C. And he was - he found work as a waiter in restaurants that no longer exist here in Washington. He worked at a golf course. He had all sorts of jobs and established a presence here and his brothers quickly followed. And several brothers lived in Maryland. They set up restaurants here in Baltimore, in Boston, in Chicago, in San Francisco and had a fairly vibrant business career by the time September 11 happened. DAVIES: It was striking to me that many of them really worked hard. I mean, they didn't have money. They worked as busboys and waiters to start. But then when their brother Hamid becomes president of Afghanistan, they go back and become big players. PARTLOW: Yeah, it was amazing. There's a - there's a hotel in the D. C. suburbs, the Bethesda Marriott hotel that has a restaurant there. And almost all of the president's brothers worked at that restaurant as busboys or waiters. Many of the Karzai's attended community college at Montgomery College in Montgomery County, Md. So they have these deep connections to the United States. And they also after September 11, when there was the miraculous turn of events that their brother was selected the leader of the country, they - several of them took advantage of that to realize some of their even larger business ambitions and set these projects in motion that, you know, a decade later became these enormous business projects, in some cases scandals. DAVIES: So let's kind of reset the scene here. In 2001, when the September 11 attacks had happened, the Taliban was in control in Afghanistan. They'd taken control after warlords fought one another following the Soviet's departure. You had the Taliban in power. The United States comes in after the 9/11 attacks, sweeps them from the capital and into the hills. And there's a need for a new government. The United States loves Hamid Karzai, makes sure he is the guy in charge. Why? What did he bring? PARTLOW: He checked a lot of boxes that the U. S. was interested in at that time. He was a Pashtun. He came from the largest ethnic group in Afghanistan, which they thought was crucial to - for the leader of the country. He spoke English. He was educated. He was rather moderate compared to the other political leaders in Afghanistan at the time. He was - he didn't have a lot of blood on his hands. He wasn't a militia leader who had war crimes in his background. He was somebody who was considered the least threatening politician by a lot of the interested parties. So the other ethnic groups were OK with him because he wasn't necessarily a threat. The Tajik, the Northern Alliance at the time thought he was someone they could work with, maybe someone they could manipulate. He was the least threatening candidate to all involved. It also happened to be that two of the other prominent charismatic Afghan political leaders were killed right before or after September 11. DAVIES: So you have Hamid Karzai coming in, a guy who speaks English pretty fluently, as do his brothers, who is educated, seems to be open to, if not outright embrace, Western values. And then fast forward to 2009 when President Barack Obama has - you know, has won the election and been inaugurated. This is eight years later. While during the Bush administration there was all this focus on Iraq, things had changed drastically in Afghanistan. What were the American goals then when Obama came into power? PARTLOW: Yeah. The situation with - in terms of the American relationship and President Karzai had changed dramatically by that point. He was seen as the leader of a corrupt government. He was seen as ineffectual in terms of developing the other institutions of government. He was widely disliked on a personal level. There had been fight after fight after fight with the United States, mostly about civilian casualties or the collateral damage of the U. S. military operation in Afghanistan. So he was seen as the source of a lot of the problems and a lot of - the reason why the United States wasn't succeeding in Afghanistan. And so when President Obama's administration came into power, the message to President Karzai was clear. It was we're not going to have the type of close, brotherly relationship that President Bush and President Karzai had. It's going to be much more distant. We're not going to talk to you as much. We're not going to meet with you as much. And President Karzai was both offended by that, but he also saw it as a sign that the U. S. government was trying to push him from power. And so while that election in 2009 took place, he became convinced that the U. S. was intent on making him lose the election and drive him from power. And so that set the tone for the relationship in the years to come. DAVIES: That was the election for president of Afghanistan. PARTLOW: Yes, that was the election in 2009 for president. DAVIES: You know, the Americans seem to be saying to Karzai, well, we're not just going to keep spending money here. We want some change, and we want some results from you. What was Karzai's style as a leader? I mean, the Americans wanted somebody who would have an efficient administration, clear chains of command, make data-driven decisions. What was his style of leadership like? PARTLOW: Right. He was much more of a tribal leader. He performed his - he presided over his citizens. People would come and have an audience with him in the palace. He greeted dozens of people each day, peasant farmers from around the country would come into the palace to air their grievances. And he would spend hours, late into the night with political leaders from all levels of the country and regular citizens across Afghanistan. And he - he did not have the type of organized, efficient palace operation that the U. S. wanted. In the book, I discuss the National Security Council, which the U. S. government had spent a lot of time and money trying to set up and make it become an efficient organization to communicate with other branches of government and solve these national security crises that came up constantly in the war. And. . . DAVIES: That's a national security council in Kabul. . . PARTLOW: Yeah. DAVIES: . . . An Afghan National Security Council. PARTLOW: Yeah, the National Security Council in Afghanistan, which was - which basically mimicked the White House version of the same office. And they printed up these elaborate committee sheets and who would brief who and who would meet with who. And that all got disregarded. And people would gather in President Karzai's office or in informal settings and hash these decisions out amongst themselves when there were no Americans present. And he basically rejected the Western style of governance that was being imposed on him. DAVIES: The other striking thing you write about in the National Security Council in Afghanistan was how many people were supposed to be employed and how many actually showed up for work. PARTLOW: Right, yeah. There were these huge - and that happened across the government ministries. There were - there were the official roles of employees and paychecks going out the door to these people who either didn't exist or didn't show up. And that was part of the broader problem of corruption that you saw across the Afghan government. And it became the real fixation of the U. S. mission in Afghanistan was how can we clean up this government? How can we make it less corrupt? And that really also set the scene for some of the greatest battles between the U. S. and Karzai's palace. DAVIES: And how much of the salaries and other costs of the Afghan government were being underwritten by American aid? PARTLOW: It was almost all of it. There was also other Western European countries that provided a lot of aid. But for the vast majority of the funding for the Afghan government, for their security forces, for their soldiers and police came from the U. S. government and U. S. taxpayer money. Just to give one example, the Afghan army and police force - it was more than $10 billion a year just to pay for their weapons, their trucks, their uniforms, their food. Everything they needed to operate came from the United States. DAVIES: Joshua Partlow's book is \"A Kingdom Of Their Own: The Family Karzai And The Afghan Disaster. \" We'll continue our conversation after a short break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR, and we're speaking with Washington Post foreign correspondent Joshua Partlow. He spent a lot of time in Afghanistan. His new book is \"A Kingdom Of Their Own: The Family Karzai And The Afghan Disaster. \" Now, corruption was a huge issue. And let's talk about how the brothers of President Karzai figured into that picture. There are some interesting characters, one of them, Mahmoud, who you describe as the Afghan Donald Trump. Tell us about him. PARTLOW: Right. He has a very enormous personality. He's - he's a talker. He has no filter. He'll say whatever he wants. And he also has these extraordinarily ambitious business projects. So he had been - had run restaurants in the United States and then moved back to Afghanistan. And his first big idea was to build a gated city in Kandahar, which is a dirt - you know, dirt poor desert farming community, extremely harsh conditions, houses made of mud, pretty rudimentary in a lot of cases, most people live in poverty. And his idea was basically to replicate a subdivision from suburban Virginia or from suburban - in the Bay Area in California where he had lived and turn Afghanistan into this modern country that he hoped it could be. And he had received $3 million from the U. S. government to get this project off the ground, even though there were a lot of problems with his proposal and they had not raised enough money on their own to get it going, and plus the land was owned by the Afghan Ministry of Defense, which nobody was quite clear about at the beginning when it started. But so he put this grand project into motion, and he actually completed it and - until there was eventual struggles over the ownership of the project and the ownership of the land. DAVIES: And this development called Aino Mina, you say like an American subdivision. Do you mean like with swimming pools and landscaping and nice houses? PARTLOW: Yeah. It had a very Western, modern look. There were granite countertops in the kitchens. There were - there was regular trash pickup at the houses. There were swimming pools, manmade lakes, hotels, mosques, hospitals. It was a city in essence. Mahmoud had driven me around the subdivision at one point, and he was pointing out fountains that were in the median in one of the main highways. And he said he'd been in Rome, and he'd seen this fountain. And so he wanted to replicate it, and some of the apartment buildings he said had - were based on the ones in Concord, Calif. , where he had lived before. So this was truly a product of his own imagination. DAVIES: Yeah, and we're talking about hundreds of millions of dollars. I mean, no ordinary developer gets something like this. He was connected. Was there a market? Did people - could people afford the houses? Did they move in? PARTLOW: People did move in. It was ultimately - he had built some of the houses to be low-income housing and he said that he wanted to cater to all the people of Kandahar and give them an opportunity to live inside here. But it ultimately turned out to be housing for the elite, the wealthy, the politically connected, including plenty of allegations of drug money being used to buy the houses or drug traffickers themselves. It also became a place as the Taliban became more violent and Kandahar became a place where people moved because it was safer. And so the demand for these houses went way up as the war got more violent in, you know, the period around 2010, 2011, 2012 because he had plenty of police and security guards, and it was a gated community. So it was walled off to some degree from the violence outside. DAVIES: So this is Mahmoud, a brother of the president. He was also involved in the scandal involving the Kabul Bank. This is a complicated story, but did he cheat? Did he make a fortune here? PARTLOW: Yeah. This is a complicated story, but the short answer is yes. He took millions of dollars in loans from this bank that - and there was no intention or expectation that these loans would be paid back. He had told me at one point Kabul Bank was his dream business, and you could see why. It was a piggy bank of money for the politically connected and the wealthy in Afghanistan. It was set up by another businessman who had lived in Dubai and moved to Afghanistan. And the idea was to take in - the way the bank actually worked was that it would take in depositors' money and loan that money out to the wealthy businessman in Afghanistan so they could jumpstart whatever other businesses or projects they had going. So Mahmoud used Kabul Bank to help finance a cement plant that he owned. He used the money for other business ventures in Afghanistan and that was common. The vice president's brother did the same thing, and several of the most prominent important Afghan businessmen used this bank in that way. And the bank ultimately came crashing down. And he was caught up in the repercussions of that. DAVIES: So Mahmoud Karzai, the president's brother comes, makes a fortune on a variety of deals some of them enveloped in scandal. Let's talk about one other brother Ahmed Wali Karzai. He is in some ways the most interesting. Tell us about him. PARTLOW: Yeah. He was an amazing figure. He was, in some ways, the most powerful of the Karzai brothers. He had been alongside the president early on. He had moved to Kandahar at the beginning of the war. He had worked closely with the U. S. Special Forces, with the CIA as they're setting up their bases in Kandahar to. . . DAVIES: And let's just explain. Kandahar is a southern province which is the kind of ancestral home of the Karzai family, right? PARTLOW: Right. Yeah. He had moved to Kandahar which was the ancestral home of the Taliban and was the - also the hometown of the Karzai family. And it was the place where both the Taliban and the U. S. military really fought for control over the course of the war. He had moved there with President Karzai in the first days after the Taliban were pushed from power. And he worked closely with the CIA and the U. S. Special Forces. He was the - a right-hand man for them to find fighters to join their militias that would work with the CIA to pursue Taliban targets. He was constantly providing intelligence. He was on the CIA payroll for the duration of his life more than a decade in the war. At the same time, Ahmed Wali was at the center of allegations about being in control of a drug empire in Kandahar. He was accused of being the kingpin figure who presided over a vast heroin-shipping operation in Afghanistan and using that money to bolster the president's political popularity or pay off friends and rivals. So when I was in Afghanistan that question about whether he was our friend or our enemy was central for the U. S. military and a lot of effort was spent investigating his personal life, his business life to try to find evidence that he was involved in the drug trade and that there would be justification for kicking him out of Afghanistan. DAVIES: Ahmed Wali Karzai had a lot of businesses that made a lot of money, but he also had a - an unofficial but very powerful political role in the province, right? He wasn't the governor, but he ran things, right? PARTLOW: Right. His official title was - he was the head of the Kandahar provincial council. But in reality, he was the most powerful man in Southern Afghanistan across several provinces. DAVIES: Joshua Partlow's book is \"A Kingdom Of Their Own: The Family Karzai And The Afghan Disaster. \" After a break, he'll tell us about some bitter feuds and rivalries within the Karzai family and the murder of one of its most powerful members. I'm Dave Davies, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies in for Terry Gross. We're speaking with Washington Post foreign correspondent Joshua Partlow. He was in Afghanistan from 2009 to 2012 when President Obama was sending more U. S. military forces and civilian aid to stem alarming gains the Taliban had made in the country. Partlow's new book looks at President Hamid Karzai and his huge family, including many brothers who were powerful figures in the country. some deeply involved in the corruption spawned by the infusion of American dollars. Partlow's book is \"A Kingdom Of Their Own. \"The United States put a lot of effort into fighting corruption. They brought in investigators, a DEA agent named Kirk Meyer and some Army folks that were determined to investigate these figures, make arrests. And, of course, they made their case to President Karzai that this was terrible, it was undermining his authority, it was undermining the war. How did the president react? PARTLOW: The president was furious. He saw these corruption investigations ultimately as an attack on his palace, as a way to weaken him in Afghanistan, to ultimately drive him from the palace. It was a - you know, it was a paranoid reading of events, I think. But these corruption investigators really took this problem personally. Kirk Meyer, you mentioned, was a DEA agent who ran a group called the Afghan Threat Finance Cell inside the U. S. embassy. And initially it had been set up to cut off the funding for the Taliban. But quickly their investigations shifted to the Afghan government, to cabinet members, to Karzai's palace and family and inner circle. And he had all these tools and an Afghan police team working for him, and they had wiretapping. And they would - they started to understand more about where the U. S. taxpayer money was going and who was stealing it. And they became infuriated, I think, both with the scope of the problem - and Kirk Meyer, in particular - and others who worked for them - he took it very personally. He saw this as taxpayer money that was being stolen right in front of their eyes. And he was willing to do anything he needed to do to stop it. And he set up a series of raids and investigations which culminated in the arrest of a man you mentioned, Mohammed Zia Salehi, who who was an aide in Karzai's palace. And he had worked with the CIA and had been involved in payments to supporters of the government. And he kind of worked in a behind-the-scenes, shadowy role. And ultimately, the - he was arrested inside his home. And President Karzai was infuriated, and he threatened to send Afghan troops to free him. It was another one of the fights between him and the U. S. government that really undercut this relationship. DAVIES: And, of course, the U. S. investigators felt that, look, if we can arrest somebody, if we can charge them and make it stick, it will send a signal throughout the country that this kind - this stuff is over and that we're going to run things fair and square. What happened to this guy who was arrested, Salehi? Did it stick? PARTLOW: No, it didn't stick. So a few hours after he went to prison, President Karzai ordered him to be freed. And the Afghan attorney general sent the order, and he was taken out of the American-run prison where he was being held. Beyond that, then Karzai issued a series of orders that prevented these U. S. -run Afghan teams from investigating corruption cases. They made it much more difficult for them to do their work. He ultimately did - he hadn't been paying much attention, to be honest, to the work of these groups before this arrest. But afterwards, he made it much more difficult for the Americans to pursue these types of cases. And it was at the same time, incidentally, where the U. S. military really got involved in Afghan anti-corruption work. So at the same time as Karzai's decided he's going to shut this stuff down, whole other operations and teams get going to try to make him investigate the very same things that he's now opposed to accepting. So I think for the American anti-corruption investigators in Afghanistan, the whole experience was very - left them very embittered ultimately because they felt that the U. S. government and Washington didn't do enough to back up their warnings, basically. They felt that the U. S. government should have cut off some of the aid to Karzai's palace and that would be the only way that he would take this message seriously and that he would do anything about the corruption problem. But to preserve whatever was left of the already tattered relationship, no one in Washington was willing to take that step. This was after all our ally in Afghanistan, and this is the government we had helped set up to try to fight the Taliban. And so we - they were - nobody was willing to go that far to actually weaken the government that we were there to work with. DAVIES: When these investigators did their work, what did they learn about the scale of the corruption, how much U. S. aid might be siphoned off to corrupt activities, payoffs? PARTLOW: They were stunned. People who'd studied corruption professionally described it to me as the first live kleptocracy they'd ever seen. There were tens of millions, hundreds of millions of dollars leaving the country on commercial airplane flights and gold bars. I mean, there was money flying out the door faster than anyone could keep track of it. The Kabul Bank scandal, which we talked about, ended up costing hundreds of millions of dollars and required a bailout that was ultimately American money and donor money to pay for. So we were paying for billions of dollars that were ultimately being stolen. DAVIES: As much as 50 percent of the American aid was - what? - leaking into the corruption? PARTLOW: Yeah, estimates as high as 50 percent of American aid was being squandered or stolen. DAVIES: Ahmed Wali was murdered by somebody he knew. Do we know what it was about? PARTLOW: Ahmed Wali was murdered by his closest lieutenant, his right-hand man, a man named Sardar Mohammed, who had been a bodyguard for the Karzai family. He'd been - he'd guarded an elder brother's home and cars. He'd guarded the family cemetery. He had - he held one of those hybrid rolls which was part militiaman, part Afghan policeman. And he was - he commanded a couple of hundred men in Kandahar, and he was accused of assassinations on Ahmed Wali's behalf. And he ultimately walked into Ahmed Wali's home one afternoon in July of 2011 while Ahmed Wali was greeting his guests on the couch and asked for a private word in a back room and then shot Ahmed Wali pointblank. And there were a lot of explanations for why that was. I think the most likely explanation to me is that he had - Ahmed Wali had taken away a lot of his influence as a militia commander. He had lost control of certain checkpoints. But there were also allegations that the CIA had killed Ahmed Wali. That was something that the - Pakistan's intelligence chief had told President Karzai directly that the CIA was responsible for the death. That was something I never really believed because Ahmed Wali had worked so closely with the CIA and was such an asset to them. There were other allegations that it - the dispute had to do with a rivalry over a woman or because he was molesting young boys. There were plenty of stories about him. But ultimately, Ahmed Wali was betrayed by one of his closest allies. DAVIES: Before we leave the story of Ahmed Wali, I mean, one of the fascinating points that you make about the Karzai family, I mean, these were - there were brothers who made a fortune from their connections to the president. But in the larger family, there were rivalries that led to violence at times - you know, murders and retaliation. PARTLOW: That's right. You know some of the worst most critical comments I heard about the Karzai's came from other members of the family, and this was a family that was divided. And what I concluded after doing this research was the course of the war, the infusion of so much money into Afghanistan and their rivalry for money and power really tore this family apart in a similar way that it tore Afghanistan apart. It was a personal tragedy for many members of the Karzai family as they were pitted against each other for control of that country. There's one story that we used down through the generations of the Karzai's starting decades back when an uncle of the president was murdered by another member of the Karzai family, and his son devotes his life to avenging that murder. And that creates a series of killings over the years that sucks in the U. S. military and becomes on a minute level an illustration of how the U. S. military often got involved in these personal feuds and tribal disputes. DAVIES: Joshua Partlow's book is \"A Kingdom Of Their Own. \" Its about the Karzai family in Afghanistan. We'll talk some more in just a moment. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR, and we're speaking with Washington Post foreign correspondent Joshua Partlow. He has a new book called \"A Kingdom Of Their Own\" about his time in Afghanistan with the Karzai family. You also note that in some respects, the Americans were having to relearn the country again and again because commanders and diplomats would rotate in and out so often. PARTLOW: That's right. It was - there's a joke that it wasn't a 10-year war. It was 10 one-year wars. And that - there was - there were grains of truth to that. Every summer the - many of the diplomats in the U. S. Embassy would rotate out. The soldiers would be on one-year rotation. So all this institutional memory that would get built up over the course of someone's tour would then - it would then go back to zero and people would start learning the name of the provinces again, and they would start, you know, learning the basic facts about Afghanistan. And that was something that I saw a repetition of - of Americans investigating and thinking about the same questions that they'd spent months earlier debating and trying to find an answer to, and they would start back at the beginning again. DAVIES: You know, it's fascinating because when I read this, you see the Americans coming in, you know, in good faith thinking they're there to defeat the Taliban and build relationships with the Afghan population. But these ethnic conflicts and tribal relations are so complicated, and they don't always get them. And it leads them to - blundering into mistakes or being manipulated into settling a personal grudge with U. S. military force. And it made me wonder that as you spent time there and spent time with these players and got to know them, do you feel - did you feel at times you knew more than the American military commanders about the country and what they needed to know? PARTLOW: That's an interesting question. I feel like I had access to certain information that most diplomats, for example, or maybe commanders wouldn't know just because I was spending so much time with Afghans as a lot of the journalists there were. And the Karzai's are great for that. Also they speak English. You can - they can explain things to you in a way that, you know, if you're learning through translation, it's - a lot gets lost. And so yeah, I became very familiar with their political rivals, how things worked on the ground that I don't think you got that nuance if you were sitting in an air-conditioned office in Kandahar Airfield. DAVIES: You talked to American military personnel a lot. Did you ever feel like telling them, look, you don't get this? PARTLOW: There's a story that I thought was funny that I heard. There was an American general who - there was a killing that was this horrible atrocity that took place where an American sergeant went out and killed maybe 16 Afghans in a village, and he was later convicted - Sergeant Bales. And the general in Kandahar at the time was distraught over this, the American general. And he had asked the Qayum Karzai, one of the elder brothers, you know, how should I deal with this? How would an Afghan deal with this situation? Should I give the families - the victims' families money? Should I buy them livestock? And those were all practices that were common when the U. S. military would inflict some collateral damage. And what Qayum Karzai said is you can't do it the way we would do it because we would give them a daughter. You know, we would trade a daughter to another tribe or family, and then, you know - and those types of customs were so foreign and so sometimes you talked to the Karzai's and you'd think I'm just like you. We both have this experience in the United States. But then there were the other aspects of Afghan culture that were so different, and were lost on a lot of Americans. DAVIES: You're no longer in Afghanistan. You're in Mexico City now, right? PARTLOW: Yeah. That's right. DAVIES: What's your sense of where Afghanistan's headed and where American policy is headed? PARTLOW: I'm really worried about what's going on now. I think the situation is a lot worse than it was even a couple of years ago. The Taliban's much stronger. They control more of the country. They're surrounding the major cities. It seems like the Afghan government basically only rules the cities now and the rural areas are the domain of the Taliban. At the same time, the government's a lot weaker than it used to be. There's been a fragile ethnic coalition for the last couple of years that have tried to rule the country with a Pashtun president and a Tajik chief executive. And there are lots of strains on that relationship and threats that that government will fall apart. So I think the situation is much more precarious than it was even a couple of years ago. DAVIES: You know, when you look at the story of Hamid Karzai in power, you see, you know, a leader who didn't have an interest in the military campaigns that the Americans were trying to run, tended to oppose and complain about American activities, tolerated enormous corruption within his government. And yet you write that a lot of people who found him so frustrating still regard him very fondly. What's your sense of him as a man and as a leader, his place in Afghan history? PARTLOW: I developed more respect for him than I initially had when I got to Afghanistan. And he impressed me in several ways. I thought he was a real patriot, a nationalist leader and a man who ultimately cared about the suffering of Afghans and their well-being. And that was driving to a large degree his opposition to the U. S. military operations in Afghanistan. I think he became paranoid about the U. S. role, particularly in the latter years. He started believing lots of conspiracy theories about what the U. S. government was up to. And I think he - what started out as opposition turned into something far darker and farther away from reality. But I think his ultimate goal, the way I saw it, was to keep the ethnic groups of Afghanistan from reverting to civil war. I think what he considered the worst and most dangerous period of Afghan history was the civil war years of the early '90s, after the Soviets had withdrawn, when there were rockets in the streets of Kabul and widespread damage and refugees flooding out of the country. And I think he was willing to overlook a lot of other crimes if he could keep the warlords and the regional strongmen from fighting against each other. So he would let his friend or let some militia commander be in charge of an Afghan ministry. And if they stole half the budget, well, that was better than that person using their artillery to fight their rival. So I think he had different goals than the United States, and that was - and different interests - and that was the source of a lot of the problems. DAVIES: Well, Joshua Partlow, thanks so much for speaking with us. PARTLOW: Thank you. It's been great to be here. DAVIES: Joshua Partlow is a foreign correspondent who's now the Mexico City bureau chief for The Washington Post. His book about Afghanistan is \"A Kingdom Of Their Own. \" Coming up, Ed Ward tells the story of the earliest Beach Boys recordings. This is FRESH AIR. DAVE DAVIES, HOST:  This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies in for Terry Gross. In 2009, the largest American diplomatic mission in the world was in Kabul, Afghanistan, where the U. S. embassy's budget of $4 billion was four times the country's domestic income. President Obama was sending more troops and civilian personnel to reverse alarming gains the Taliban had made. And so much cash was flowing into the country that President Hamid Karzai's chief of staff had a money counting machine in his office. Those are some details in a new book from our guest, Washington Post foreign correspondent Joshua Partlow. Partlow was in Afghanistan from 2009 to 2012, and his account of those years is a story of government dysfunction, rampant corruption and increasing civilian hostility to American military operations. Partlow looks at the Afghanistan experience through the prism of the Karzai family, the president and his brothers, many educated in America, who became important players in the political strife, corruption and violence in the country. Besides his tour in Afghanistan, Joshua Partlow has done reporting in Iraq and Latin America. He's now The Washington Post's Mexico bureau chief. His book is \"A Kingdom Of Their Own: The Family Karzai And The Afghan Disaster. \" Well, Joshua Partlow, welcome to FRESH AIR. This is a big family, an influential family in Afghanistan. It includes Hamid Karzai, the president, but many others. You know, we have famous political families in this country. I mean, the Taft's going way back, the Kennedys, probably the most famous. Tell us about this family and why you wanted to focus on them. JOSHUA PARTLOW: This was the family who was in charge in Afghanistan and was involved in all aspects of Afghanistan when I arrived in the summer of 2009, just before President Hamid Karzai's election to his second term. And they had - they had come to define the decade-long war at that point. And they would be in power in the years that followed as well. And they had - they struck me just as a fascinating and frustrating and intriguing family, I mean, starting with the president himself. He was full of contradictions. He was the commander in chief at a time when the U. S. military had 100,000 troops in Afghanistan and yet he was - had these pacifistic tendencies. He was - he was extremely sensitive to violence. He would cry in public. He was - he had started the war in 2001 as a pro-American Muslim leader, and he had become the greatest critic of the U. S. military's presence in Afghanistan. And he was, you know, the leading figure in this family that had enriched itself during the course of the war, and yet he had these tendencies to live a very humble life. And he'd scorned material wealth, and he changed the way the palace was run in order to have things more plain and more simple. So I was intrigued by all these factors and wanted to explore this family more deeply. DAVIES: I want to talk about some of his brothers and half-brothers who played really important roles in Afghanistan. But speaking generally, it's - what's one of the fascinating things is that these brothers, when the Soviets invaded in 1979, many of them made their ways - their way to the United States and had careers then. You want to just give us a little bit of a picture of these brothers and where they were in America? PARTLOW: Yeah. The family was scattered by the Soviet war in Afghanistan in the 1980s. Some people, like Hamid Karzai, moved to Pakistan and got involved in the resistance to the Soviet war in Afghanistan, working with the mujahedeen groups. And others moved to the United States and had completely different careers. Qayum Karzai was the first to arrive here. He was an elder brother, and he came on an Afghan air force program and trained in U. S. military bases in Oklahoma and then got airsick and realized being a pilot wasn't for him. And he scraped money together and drove a car cross-country and ended up in Washington, D. C. And he was - he found work as a waiter in restaurants that no longer exist here in Washington. He worked at a golf course. He had all sorts of jobs and established a presence here and his brothers quickly followed. And several brothers lived in Maryland. They set up restaurants here in Baltimore, in Boston, in Chicago, in San Francisco and had a fairly vibrant business career by the time September 11 happened. DAVIES: It was striking to me that many of them really worked hard. I mean, they didn't have money. They worked as busboys and waiters to start. But then when their brother Hamid becomes president of Afghanistan, they go back and become big players. PARTLOW: Yeah, it was amazing. There's a - there's a hotel in the D. C. suburbs, the Bethesda Marriott hotel that has a restaurant there. And almost all of the president's brothers worked at that restaurant as busboys or waiters. Many of the Karzai's attended community college at Montgomery College in Montgomery County, Md. So they have these deep connections to the United States. And they also after September 11, when there was the miraculous turn of events that their brother was selected the leader of the country, they - several of them took advantage of that to realize some of their even larger business ambitions and set these projects in motion that, you know, a decade later became these enormous business projects, in some cases scandals. DAVIES: So let's kind of reset the scene here. In 2001, when the September 11 attacks had happened, the Taliban was in control in Afghanistan. They'd taken control after warlords fought one another following the Soviet's departure. You had the Taliban in power. The United States comes in after the 9/11 attacks, sweeps them from the capital and into the hills. And there's a need for a new government. The United States loves Hamid Karzai, makes sure he is the guy in charge. Why? What did he bring? PARTLOW: He checked a lot of boxes that the U. S. was interested in at that time. He was a Pashtun. He came from the largest ethnic group in Afghanistan, which they thought was crucial to - for the leader of the country. He spoke English. He was educated. He was rather moderate compared to the other political leaders in Afghanistan at the time. He was - he didn't have a lot of blood on his hands. He wasn't a militia leader who had war crimes in his background. He was somebody who was considered the least threatening politician by a lot of the interested parties. So the other ethnic groups were OK with him because he wasn't necessarily a threat. The Tajik, the Northern Alliance at the time thought he was someone they could work with, maybe someone they could manipulate. He was the least threatening candidate to all involved. It also happened to be that two of the other prominent charismatic Afghan political leaders were killed right before or after September 11. DAVIES: So you have Hamid Karzai coming in, a guy who speaks English pretty fluently, as do his brothers, who is educated, seems to be open to, if not outright embrace, Western values. And then fast forward to 2009 when President Barack Obama has - you know, has won the election and been inaugurated. This is eight years later. While during the Bush administration there was all this focus on Iraq, things had changed drastically in Afghanistan. What were the American goals then when Obama came into power? PARTLOW: Yeah. The situation with - in terms of the American relationship and President Karzai had changed dramatically by that point. He was seen as the leader of a corrupt government. He was seen as ineffectual in terms of developing the other institutions of government. He was widely disliked on a personal level. There had been fight after fight after fight with the United States, mostly about civilian casualties or the collateral damage of the U. S. military operation in Afghanistan. So he was seen as the source of a lot of the problems and a lot of - the reason why the United States wasn't succeeding in Afghanistan. And so when President Obama's administration came into power, the message to President Karzai was clear. It was we're not going to have the type of close, brotherly relationship that President Bush and President Karzai had. It's going to be much more distant. We're not going to talk to you as much. We're not going to meet with you as much. And President Karzai was both offended by that, but he also saw it as a sign that the U. S. government was trying to push him from power. And so while that election in 2009 took place, he became convinced that the U. S. was intent on making him lose the election and drive him from power. And so that set the tone for the relationship in the years to come. DAVIES: That was the election for president of Afghanistan. PARTLOW: Yes, that was the election in 2009 for president. DAVIES: You know, the Americans seem to be saying to Karzai, well, we're not just going to keep spending money here. We want some change, and we want some results from you. What was Karzai's style as a leader? I mean, the Americans wanted somebody who would have an efficient administration, clear chains of command, make data-driven decisions. What was his style of leadership like? PARTLOW: Right. He was much more of a tribal leader. He performed his - he presided over his citizens. People would come and have an audience with him in the palace. He greeted dozens of people each day, peasant farmers from around the country would come into the palace to air their grievances. And he would spend hours, late into the night with political leaders from all levels of the country and regular citizens across Afghanistan. And he - he did not have the type of organized, efficient palace operation that the U. S. wanted. In the book, I discuss the National Security Council, which the U. S. government had spent a lot of time and money trying to set up and make it become an efficient organization to communicate with other branches of government and solve these national security crises that came up constantly in the war. And. . . DAVIES: That's a national security council in Kabul. . . PARTLOW: Yeah. DAVIES: . . . An Afghan National Security Council. PARTLOW: Yeah, the National Security Council in Afghanistan, which was - which basically mimicked the White House version of the same office. And they printed up these elaborate committee sheets and who would brief who and who would meet with who. And that all got disregarded. And people would gather in President Karzai's office or in informal settings and hash these decisions out amongst themselves when there were no Americans present. And he basically rejected the Western style of governance that was being imposed on him. DAVIES: The other striking thing you write about in the National Security Council in Afghanistan was how many people were supposed to be employed and how many actually showed up for work. PARTLOW: Right, yeah. There were these huge - and that happened across the government ministries. There were - there were the official roles of employees and paychecks going out the door to these people who either didn't exist or didn't show up. And that was part of the broader problem of corruption that you saw across the Afghan government. And it became the real fixation of the U. S. mission in Afghanistan was how can we clean up this government? How can we make it less corrupt? And that really also set the scene for some of the greatest battles between the U. S. and Karzai's palace. DAVIES: And how much of the salaries and other costs of the Afghan government were being underwritten by American aid? PARTLOW: It was almost all of it. There was also other Western European countries that provided a lot of aid. But for the vast majority of the funding for the Afghan government, for their security forces, for their soldiers and police came from the U. S. government and U. S. taxpayer money. Just to give one example, the Afghan army and police force - it was more than $10 billion a year just to pay for their weapons, their trucks, their uniforms, their food. Everything they needed to operate came from the United States. DAVIES: Joshua Partlow's book is \"A Kingdom Of Their Own: The Family Karzai And The Afghan Disaster. \" We'll continue our conversation after a short break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR, and we're speaking with Washington Post foreign correspondent Joshua Partlow. He spent a lot of time in Afghanistan. His new book is \"A Kingdom Of Their Own: The Family Karzai And The Afghan Disaster. \" Now, corruption was a huge issue. And let's talk about how the brothers of President Karzai figured into that picture. There are some interesting characters, one of them, Mahmoud, who you describe as the Afghan Donald Trump. Tell us about him. PARTLOW: Right. He has a very enormous personality. He's - he's a talker. He has no filter. He'll say whatever he wants. And he also has these extraordinarily ambitious business projects. So he had been - had run restaurants in the United States and then moved back to Afghanistan. And his first big idea was to build a gated city in Kandahar, which is a dirt - you know, dirt poor desert farming community, extremely harsh conditions, houses made of mud, pretty rudimentary in a lot of cases, most people live in poverty. And his idea was basically to replicate a subdivision from suburban Virginia or from suburban - in the Bay Area in California where he had lived and turn Afghanistan into this modern country that he hoped it could be. And he had received $3 million from the U. S. government to get this project off the ground, even though there were a lot of problems with his proposal and they had not raised enough money on their own to get it going, and plus the land was owned by the Afghan Ministry of Defense, which nobody was quite clear about at the beginning when it started. But so he put this grand project into motion, and he actually completed it and - until there was eventual struggles over the ownership of the project and the ownership of the land. DAVIES: And this development called Aino Mina, you say like an American subdivision. Do you mean like with swimming pools and landscaping and nice houses? PARTLOW: Yeah. It had a very Western, modern look. There were granite countertops in the kitchens. There were - there was regular trash pickup at the houses. There were swimming pools, manmade lakes, hotels, mosques, hospitals. It was a city in essence. Mahmoud had driven me around the subdivision at one point, and he was pointing out fountains that were in the median in one of the main highways. And he said he'd been in Rome, and he'd seen this fountain. And so he wanted to replicate it, and some of the apartment buildings he said had - were based on the ones in Concord, Calif. , where he had lived before. So this was truly a product of his own imagination. DAVIES: Yeah, and we're talking about hundreds of millions of dollars. I mean, no ordinary developer gets something like this. He was connected. Was there a market? Did people - could people afford the houses? Did they move in? PARTLOW: People did move in. It was ultimately - he had built some of the houses to be low-income housing and he said that he wanted to cater to all the people of Kandahar and give them an opportunity to live inside here. But it ultimately turned out to be housing for the elite, the wealthy, the politically connected, including plenty of allegations of drug money being used to buy the houses or drug traffickers themselves. It also became a place as the Taliban became more violent and Kandahar became a place where people moved because it was safer. And so the demand for these houses went way up as the war got more violent in, you know, the period around 2010, 2011, 2012 because he had plenty of police and security guards, and it was a gated community. So it was walled off to some degree from the violence outside. DAVIES: So this is Mahmoud, a brother of the president. He was also involved in the scandal involving the Kabul Bank. This is a complicated story, but did he cheat? Did he make a fortune here? PARTLOW: Yeah. This is a complicated story, but the short answer is yes. He took millions of dollars in loans from this bank that - and there was no intention or expectation that these loans would be paid back. He had told me at one point Kabul Bank was his dream business, and you could see why. It was a piggy bank of money for the politically connected and the wealthy in Afghanistan. It was set up by another businessman who had lived in Dubai and moved to Afghanistan. And the idea was to take in - the way the bank actually worked was that it would take in depositors' money and loan that money out to the wealthy businessman in Afghanistan so they could jumpstart whatever other businesses or projects they had going. So Mahmoud used Kabul Bank to help finance a cement plant that he owned. He used the money for other business ventures in Afghanistan and that was common. The vice president's brother did the same thing, and several of the most prominent important Afghan businessmen used this bank in that way. And the bank ultimately came crashing down. And he was caught up in the repercussions of that. DAVIES: So Mahmoud Karzai, the president's brother comes, makes a fortune on a variety of deals some of them enveloped in scandal. Let's talk about one other brother Ahmed Wali Karzai. He is in some ways the most interesting. Tell us about him. PARTLOW: Yeah. He was an amazing figure. He was, in some ways, the most powerful of the Karzai brothers. He had been alongside the president early on. He had moved to Kandahar at the beginning of the war. He had worked closely with the U. S. Special Forces, with the CIA as they're setting up their bases in Kandahar to. . . DAVIES: And let's just explain. Kandahar is a southern province which is the kind of ancestral home of the Karzai family, right? PARTLOW: Right. Yeah. He had moved to Kandahar which was the ancestral home of the Taliban and was the - also the hometown of the Karzai family. And it was the place where both the Taliban and the U. S. military really fought for control over the course of the war. He had moved there with President Karzai in the first days after the Taliban were pushed from power. And he worked closely with the CIA and the U. S. Special Forces. He was the - a right-hand man for them to find fighters to join their militias that would work with the CIA to pursue Taliban targets. He was constantly providing intelligence. He was on the CIA payroll for the duration of his life more than a decade in the war. At the same time, Ahmed Wali was at the center of allegations about being in control of a drug empire in Kandahar. He was accused of being the kingpin figure who presided over a vast heroin-shipping operation in Afghanistan and using that money to bolster the president's political popularity or pay off friends and rivals. So when I was in Afghanistan that question about whether he was our friend or our enemy was central for the U. S. military and a lot of effort was spent investigating his personal life, his business life to try to find evidence that he was involved in the drug trade and that there would be justification for kicking him out of Afghanistan. DAVIES: Ahmed Wali Karzai had a lot of businesses that made a lot of money, but he also had a - an unofficial but very powerful political role in the province, right? He wasn't the governor, but he ran things, right? PARTLOW: Right. His official title was - he was the head of the Kandahar provincial council. But in reality, he was the most powerful man in Southern Afghanistan across several provinces. DAVIES: Joshua Partlow's book is \"A Kingdom Of Their Own: The Family Karzai And The Afghan Disaster. \" After a break, he'll tell us about some bitter feuds and rivalries within the Karzai family and the murder of one of its most powerful members. I'm Dave Davies, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies in for Terry Gross. We're speaking with Washington Post foreign correspondent Joshua Partlow. He was in Afghanistan from 2009 to 2012 when President Obama was sending more U. S. military forces and civilian aid to stem alarming gains the Taliban had made in the country. Partlow's new book looks at President Hamid Karzai and his huge family, including many brothers who were powerful figures in the country. some deeply involved in the corruption spawned by the infusion of American dollars. Partlow's book is \"A Kingdom Of Their Own. \" The United States put a lot of effort into fighting corruption. They brought in investigators, a DEA agent named Kirk Meyer and some Army folks that were determined to investigate these figures, make arrests. And, of course, they made their case to President Karzai that this was terrible, it was undermining his authority, it was undermining the war. How did the president react? PARTLOW: The president was furious. He saw these corruption investigations ultimately as an attack on his palace, as a way to weaken him in Afghanistan, to ultimately drive him from the palace. It was a - you know, it was a paranoid reading of events, I think. But these corruption investigators really took this problem personally. Kirk Meyer, you mentioned, was a DEA agent who ran a group called the Afghan Threat Finance Cell inside the U. S. embassy. And initially it had been set up to cut off the funding for the Taliban. But quickly their investigations shifted to the Afghan government, to cabinet members, to Karzai's palace and family and inner circle. And he had all these tools and an Afghan police team working for him, and they had wiretapping. And they would - they started to understand more about where the U. S. taxpayer money was going and who was stealing it. And they became infuriated, I think, both with the scope of the problem - and Kirk Meyer, in particular - and others who worked for them - he took it very personally. He saw this as taxpayer money that was being stolen right in front of their eyes. And he was willing to do anything he needed to do to stop it. And he set up a series of raids and investigations which culminated in the arrest of a man you mentioned, Mohammed Zia Salehi, who who was an aide in Karzai's palace. And he had worked with the CIA and had been involved in payments to supporters of the government. And he kind of worked in a behind-the-scenes, shadowy role. And ultimately, the - he was arrested inside his home. And President Karzai was infuriated, and he threatened to send Afghan troops to free him. It was another one of the fights between him and the U. S. government that really undercut this relationship. DAVIES: And, of course, the U. S. investigators felt that, look, if we can arrest somebody, if we can charge them and make it stick, it will send a signal throughout the country that this kind - this stuff is over and that we're going to run things fair and square. What happened to this guy who was arrested, Salehi? Did it stick? PARTLOW: No, it didn't stick. So a few hours after he went to prison, President Karzai ordered him to be freed. And the Afghan attorney general sent the order, and he was taken out of the American-run prison where he was being held. Beyond that, then Karzai issued a series of orders that prevented these U. S. -run Afghan teams from investigating corruption cases. They made it much more difficult for them to do their work. He ultimately did - he hadn't been paying much attention, to be honest, to the work of these groups before this arrest. But afterwards, he made it much more difficult for the Americans to pursue these types of cases. And it was at the same time, incidentally, where the U. S. military really got involved in Afghan anti-corruption work. So at the same time as Karzai's decided he's going to shut this stuff down, whole other operations and teams get going to try to make him investigate the very same things that he's now opposed to accepting. So I think for the American anti-corruption investigators in Afghanistan, the whole experience was very - left them very embittered ultimately because they felt that the U. S. government and Washington didn't do enough to back up their warnings, basically. They felt that the U. S. government should have cut off some of the aid to Karzai's palace and that would be the only way that he would take this message seriously and that he would do anything about the corruption problem. But to preserve whatever was left of the already tattered relationship, no one in Washington was willing to take that step. This was after all our ally in Afghanistan, and this is the government we had helped set up to try to fight the Taliban. And so we - they were - nobody was willing to go that far to actually weaken the government that we were there to work with. DAVIES: When these investigators did their work, what did they learn about the scale of the corruption, how much U. S. aid might be siphoned off to corrupt activities, payoffs? PARTLOW: They were stunned. People who'd studied corruption professionally described it to me as the first live kleptocracy they'd ever seen. There were tens of millions, hundreds of millions of dollars leaving the country on commercial airplane flights and gold bars. I mean, there was money flying out the door faster than anyone could keep track of it. The Kabul Bank scandal, which we talked about, ended up costing hundreds of millions of dollars and required a bailout that was ultimately American money and donor money to pay for. So we were paying for billions of dollars that were ultimately being stolen. DAVIES: As much as 50 percent of the American aid was - what? - leaking into the corruption? PARTLOW: Yeah, estimates as high as 50 percent of American aid was being squandered or stolen. DAVIES: Ahmed Wali was murdered by somebody he knew. Do we know what it was about? PARTLOW: Ahmed Wali was murdered by his closest lieutenant, his right-hand man, a man named Sardar Mohammed, who had been a bodyguard for the Karzai family. He'd been - he'd guarded an elder brother's home and cars. He'd guarded the family cemetery. He had - he held one of those hybrid rolls which was part militiaman, part Afghan policeman. And he was - he commanded a couple of hundred men in Kandahar, and he was accused of assassinations on Ahmed Wali's behalf. And he ultimately walked into Ahmed Wali's home one afternoon in July of 2011 while Ahmed Wali was greeting his guests on the couch and asked for a private word in a back room and then shot Ahmed Wali pointblank. And there were a lot of explanations for why that was. I think the most likely explanation to me is that he had - Ahmed Wali had taken away a lot of his influence as a militia commander. He had lost control of certain checkpoints. But there were also allegations that the CIA had killed Ahmed Wali. That was something that the - Pakistan's intelligence chief had told President Karzai directly that the CIA was responsible for the death. That was something I never really believed because Ahmed Wali had worked so closely with the CIA and was such an asset to them. There were other allegations that it - the dispute had to do with a rivalry over a woman or because he was molesting young boys. There were plenty of stories about him. But ultimately, Ahmed Wali was betrayed by one of his closest allies. DAVIES: Before we leave the story of Ahmed Wali, I mean, one of the fascinating points that you make about the Karzai family, I mean, these were - there were brothers who made a fortune from their connections to the president. But in the larger family, there were rivalries that led to violence at times - you know, murders and retaliation. PARTLOW: That's right. You know some of the worst most critical comments I heard about the Karzai's came from other members of the family, and this was a family that was divided. And what I concluded after doing this research was the course of the war, the infusion of so much money into Afghanistan and their rivalry for money and power really tore this family apart in a similar way that it tore Afghanistan apart. It was a personal tragedy for many members of the Karzai family as they were pitted against each other for control of that country. There's one story that we used down through the generations of the Karzai's starting decades back when an uncle of the president was murdered by another member of the Karzai family, and his son devotes his life to avenging that murder. And that creates a series of killings over the years that sucks in the U. S. military and becomes on a minute level an illustration of how the U. S. military often got involved in these personal feuds and tribal disputes. DAVIES: Joshua Partlow's book is \"A Kingdom Of Their Own. \" Its about the Karzai family in Afghanistan. We'll talk some more in just a moment. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR, and we're speaking with Washington Post foreign correspondent Joshua Partlow. He has a new book called \"A Kingdom Of Their Own\" about his time in Afghanistan with the Karzai family. You also note that in some respects, the Americans were having to relearn the country again and again because commanders and diplomats would rotate in and out so often. PARTLOW: That's right. It was - there's a joke that it wasn't a 10-year war. It was 10 one-year wars. And that - there was - there were grains of truth to that. Every summer the - many of the diplomats in the U. S. Embassy would rotate out. The soldiers would be on one-year rotation. So all this institutional memory that would get built up over the course of someone's tour would then - it would then go back to zero and people would start learning the name of the provinces again, and they would start, you know, learning the basic facts about Afghanistan. And that was something that I saw a repetition of - of Americans investigating and thinking about the same questions that they'd spent months earlier debating and trying to find an answer to, and they would start back at the beginning again. DAVIES: You know, it's fascinating because when I read this, you see the Americans coming in, you know, in good faith thinking they're there to defeat the Taliban and build relationships with the Afghan population. But these ethnic conflicts and tribal relations are so complicated, and they don't always get them. And it leads them to - blundering into mistakes or being manipulated into settling a personal grudge with U. S. military force. And it made me wonder that as you spent time there and spent time with these players and got to know them, do you feel - did you feel at times you knew more than the American military commanders about the country and what they needed to know? PARTLOW: That's an interesting question. I feel like I had access to certain information that most diplomats, for example, or maybe commanders wouldn't know just because I was spending so much time with Afghans as a lot of the journalists there were. And the Karzai's are great for that. Also they speak English. You can - they can explain things to you in a way that, you know, if you're learning through translation, it's - a lot gets lost. And so yeah, I became very familiar with their political rivals, how things worked on the ground that I don't think you got that nuance if you were sitting in an air-conditioned office in Kandahar Airfield. DAVIES: You talked to American military personnel a lot. Did you ever feel like telling them, look, you don't get this? PARTLOW: There's a story that I thought was funny that I heard. There was an American general who - there was a killing that was this horrible atrocity that took place where an American sergeant went out and killed maybe 16 Afghans in a village, and he was later convicted - Sergeant Bales. And the general in Kandahar at the time was distraught over this, the American general. And he had asked the Qayum Karzai, one of the elder brothers, you know, how should I deal with this? How would an Afghan deal with this situation? Should I give the families - the victims' families money? Should I buy them livestock? And those were all practices that were common when the U. S. military would inflict some collateral damage. And what Qayum Karzai said is you can't do it the way we would do it because we would give them a daughter. You know, we would trade a daughter to another tribe or family, and then, you know - and those types of customs were so foreign and so sometimes you talked to the Karzai's and you'd think I'm just like you. We both have this experience in the United States. But then there were the other aspects of Afghan culture that were so different, and were lost on a lot of Americans. DAVIES: You're no longer in Afghanistan. You're in Mexico City now, right? PARTLOW: Yeah. That's right. DAVIES: What's your sense of where Afghanistan's headed and where American policy is headed? PARTLOW: I'm really worried about what's going on now. I think the situation is a lot worse than it was even a couple of years ago. The Taliban's much stronger. They control more of the country. They're surrounding the major cities. It seems like the Afghan government basically only rules the cities now and the rural areas are the domain of the Taliban. At the same time, the government's a lot weaker than it used to be. There's been a fragile ethnic coalition for the last couple of years that have tried to rule the country with a Pashtun president and a Tajik chief executive. And there are lots of strains on that relationship and threats that that government will fall apart. So I think the situation is much more precarious than it was even a couple of years ago. DAVIES: You know, when you look at the story of Hamid Karzai in power, you see, you know, a leader who didn't have an interest in the military campaigns that the Americans were trying to run, tended to oppose and complain about American activities, tolerated enormous corruption within his government. And yet you write that a lot of people who found him so frustrating still regard him very fondly. What's your sense of him as a man and as a leader, his place in Afghan history? PARTLOW: I developed more respect for him than I initially had when I got to Afghanistan. And he impressed me in several ways. I thought he was a real patriot, a nationalist leader and a man who ultimately cared about the suffering of Afghans and their well-being. And that was driving to a large degree his opposition to the U. S. military operations in Afghanistan. I think he became paranoid about the U. S. role, particularly in the latter years. He started believing lots of conspiracy theories about what the U. S. government was up to. And I think he - what started out as opposition turned into something far darker and farther away from reality. But I think his ultimate goal, the way I saw it, was to keep the ethnic groups of Afghanistan from reverting to civil war. I think what he considered the worst and most dangerous period of Afghan history was the civil war years of the early '90s, after the Soviets had withdrawn, when there were rockets in the streets of Kabul and widespread damage and refugees flooding out of the country. And I think he was willing to overlook a lot of other crimes if he could keep the warlords and the regional strongmen from fighting against each other. So he would let his friend or let some militia commander be in charge of an Afghan ministry. And if they stole half the budget, well, that was better than that person using their artillery to fight their rival. So I think he had different goals than the United States, and that was - and different interests - and that was the source of a lot of the problems.

But today, the Senate will vote to do just that. The bill in question is popular with both Republicans and Democrats. It would allow families of the victims of the September 11 attacks to sue Saudi Arabia for allegedly supporting those attackers, 15 of whom were Saudi nationals. On Monday, White House spokesman Josh Earnest explained the president's decision. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JOSH EARNEST: We're not just concerned about the impact that this bill would have on the U. S. relationship with Saudi Arabia. We're deeply concerned about the impact that this bill would have on the U. S. relationship with countries all around the world. And that's why the president vetoed it at the end of last week. MONTAGNE: The House is likely to take up the override veto by the end of the week. And for more, we turned to NPR's congressional correspondent, Ailsa Chang. Good morning. AILSA CHANG, BYLINE: Good morning, Renee. MONTAGNE: Before we get into this probable first-ever override of a veto, take us back for a moment for a look at this bill. CHANG: Yeah, so this is a bill that would give 9/11 families the right to pursue legal claims against any country they feel played some role in any terrorism attack on U. S. soil. In this case, it would be Saudi Arabia. These families have been looking to demand monetary compensation for years. Many of them believe Saudi Arabia was somehow involved in the attacks. Saudi Arabia has denied this adamantly. And the bill has been circulating the Capitol for a really long time. It just never got to the floor and passed until this year. MONTAGNE: But can't these families do that already? I mean, civil lawsuits have been allowed against state sponsors of terrorism. Have they not? CHANG: That's absolutely correct. Congress has allowed Americans to sue countries that had been designated as state sponsors of terrorism. But that list is limited to only three countries right now - Iran, Syria and Sudan. MONTAGNE: And those are the key words - state sponsors of terrorism. CHANG: Right. And you notice that Saudi Arabia is not on that list. The White House says those designations are made only after very careful review by national security, intelligence and foreign policy officials. They're not decisions that should be left to private litigants and judges in courtrooms. And what this 9/11 bill does is it allows lawsuits against any country that any U. S. citizen believes helped or financed a terrorism attack on U. S. soil. MONTAGNE: And, of course, Saudi Arabia is an ally - a longtime ally - of the United States. But, Ailsa, the president vetoed this on a bigger principle that even some senators are now worried about. CHANG: That's right. There are a lot of concerns about a principle known as sovereign immunity. It's this idea that a country should remain immune from lawsuits in the courts of another country. It's a long-held principle under international law. And although there are some very limited exceptions to that principle, some lawmakers and the White House believe this 9/11 bill carves out too expansive of an exception. And they fear that other countries might reciprocate and drag U. S. government officials or members of our own military into lawsuits in foreign courts under this theory that those people helped cause some injury abroad. In fact, Republican Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee told me that was his biggest concern right now about the bill. BOB CORKER: Let's face it, we're the greatest nation on Earth. We have more involvements around the world than any country. We've got assets deployed all around the world, more than any country. So if sovereign immunity issues recede, we're the nation that is most exposed. CHANG: So he's worried that the U. S. would be exposed to a flood of litigation. And what would the discovery process look like in such litigation? Might it force the U. S. to hand over sensitive national security information? Those are all concerns that are bubbling around the Capitol right now, just as this override vote is upon Congress. MONTAGNE: And what do supporters of this bill say to those concerns? CHANG: Well, essentially there's a perception that it's a little alarmist to think this bill is going to erode the principle of sovereign immunity, that there will be a flood of litigation. Many lawmakers think the White House's concerns are a bit overblown, that the concept of sovereign immunity is not absolute anyway. There are already exceptions to it. And they feel that the White House's concerns about interfering with our global relationships are a bit overblown. This bill is ultimately about giving 9/11 victims a chance to be heard in court to the supporters of the bill. Here's Democratic Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon. He's a senior member of the Intelligence Committee. RON WYDEN: The issue it's fundamentally about is whether someone would have the opportunity to raise their concerns in the judicial system. It's not a judgment about how a case would come out. But it seems to me that it is appropriate - particularly in light of the families - that they should have a chance to raise their concerns in court. MONTAGNE: OK, Ailsa, so this idea of the families being able to at least experience some sense of justice and raise their concerns, I imagine made it easier for lawmakers on both sides of the aisle to embrace the bill originally. But it takes two-thirds of each chamber to override a presidential veto, and it sounds like there are some lawmakers who are beginning to think about backing off. CHANG: Well, concerns do seem a little late in the game now. But remember, when this bill was working its way through Congress, it had an enormous amount of goodwill because it was considered a bill that helped 9/11 families. Everyone is onboard with that idea. But then this bill sailed through both chambers through voice votes - or a voice vote in the House, what's called unanimous consent in the Senate, meaning members didn't have to go on the record as a yes or no vote on the bill. But now this override vote is going to be the first time members will have to attach their names to a yes or no vote on this bill. And that's why many of them are just beginning to study the bill and are just beginning to have concerns about it. MONTAGNE: Still though, this override is expected to be successful. CHANG: That's right. Leaders in both chambers are confident about that. MONTAGNE: NPR's congressional correspondent Ailsa Chang, thanks very much. CHANG: You're welcome. RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST:  President Obama almost got through eight years in office without having any of his vetoes overridden by a hostile Congress. But today, the Senate will vote to do just that. The bill in question is popular with both Republicans and Democrats. It would allow families of the victims of the September 11 attacks to sue Saudi Arabia for allegedly supporting those attackers, 15 of whom were Saudi nationals. On Monday, White House spokesman Josh Earnest explained the president's decision. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JOSH EARNEST: We're not just concerned about the impact that this bill would have on the U. S. relationship with Saudi Arabia. We're deeply concerned about the impact that this bill would have on the U. S. relationship with countries all around the world. And that's why the president vetoed it at the end of last week. MONTAGNE: The House is likely to take up the override veto by the end of the week. And for more, we turned to NPR's congressional correspondent, Ailsa Chang. Good morning. AILSA CHANG, BYLINE: Good morning, Renee. MONTAGNE: Before we get into this probable first-ever override of a veto, take us back for a moment for a look at this bill. CHANG: Yeah, so this is a bill that would give 9/11 families the right to pursue legal claims against any country they feel played some role in any terrorism attack on U. S. soil. In this case, it would be Saudi Arabia. These families have been looking to demand monetary compensation for years. Many of them believe Saudi Arabia was somehow involved in the attacks.

Modern Iraq is a land that once contained some of the most important places in human civilization, including Babylon and Mesopotamia. This week, a new museum opened its doors, aiming to preserve that heritage with help from curators from the British Museum. It's in Basra in southern Iraq in the palace of a dictator, and that is symbolic, says the director of the Basra museum, Qahtan al-Abeed. We reached him by Skype. Welcome to the program. QAHTAN AL-ABEED: Thank you very much. MONTAGNE: The museum, it's housed in one of Saddam Hussein's former palaces, old palaces. And what does that mean to you? Because obviously there must be some bad connotations to one of Saddam's buildings. AL-ABEED: You know why we turned this building to be a museum? It's to let the bad memory of Iraqis during the Saddam Hussein time to be a civilization place, a cultural place, not a dictatorian (ph) place. MONTAGNE: Right because I know Iraqis are very proud of their very, very long place in history. AL-ABEED: Yes. We have a grand history, and we have the Mesopotamians for humanity. This is the civilization. It's not only for Iraq. So that's why we're trying to make a museum to exhibit objects from all the periods. MONTAGNE: And describe for us what is on display at this moment in time. For you, the most prized items are antiquities. AL-ABEED: All the objects are very important, but we have some unique coins in this exhibitions. This is the first time for presentation, this coins. It's Parthian, Sasanian, Islamic period. which mean 400 B. C. until the 18th century. For me, this is very interesting, but we have 440 different artifacts - pottery jar, glazed jar, mosque decoration, different plates and bronze and different objects from Basra's excavated sites. But the difference between the Basra museum and other museums in Iraq, we are planning to make Basra museum as a model for other Iraqi museum and maybe for the region. MONTAGNE: How so? AL-ABEED: Our aim, it's not just to put the object inside the showcases and ask the visitors come to see. No, our idea, it's the education first and the cultural activities. Also we opened education room. This is for the teaching the students how to make pottery, glass, how to write cuneiform or drawing, painting, different activities. MONTAGNE: You've been working on this for years. It is your museum, in a sense. You're the director. What does it mean to you that the doors have opened on this Basra museum? AL-ABEED: I feel proud. I really feel very happy because we did very hard time 2008, 2007 and '06, very dangerous time. We have a religious problem in the country that was really very difficult, but we did our best. And supporting by our friends from outside Iraq, it was really very strong. And that's why we have this very good succeed. I think if we all together be in one hand at the end, we will have the peace. So this is the most important things. MONTAGNE: Qahtan al-Abeed is the director of the Basra museum in southern Iraq.

It was Sunday in Guelph, Ontario. And no tailor shop was open. Jo Du didn't want to walk down the aisle to marry Earl Lee with pins in the back of her dress. But no one in the wedding party knew how to make the repair. An enterprising bridesmaid knocked on a neighbor's door to ask David Hobson if he might have a pair of pliers they could borrow. Mr. Hobson took in the situation - the bridesmaid, the lacy, white dress and a request for pliers - and said, I've got better than tools. I've got a master tailor. David Hobson had a family of Syrian refugees from Aleppo living in his home for a few days, a mother, father and three children. A local businessman, Jim Estill, has helped 50 Syrian families enter Canada and settle in the Guelph area - people from one of the most hellish landscapes on earth brought to live in one of the safest, tidiest and most serene towns in Canada. The father of the Syrian family is Ibrahim Halil Dudu. He was indeed a master tailor in Aleppo for 28 years. And as soon as he saw the dress, Ibrahim Dudu got out his sewing kit and set to work. He literally sewed her wedding dress back on to her, Lindsay Coulter, the wedding photographer, told CTV News. Everyone was so grateful. They said thank you a million times. Turns out both the Du and Lee families are immigrants to Canada, too. Many of the bridesmaids were from China and were bowing to say thanks, said Lindsay Coulter, who posted photos and wrote on her Facebook page, every weekend, I take photos of people on the happiest days of their lives. And today, one man who has seen some of the worst things our world has to offer came to the rescue. I was so excited and so happy, Ibrahim Halil Dudu said through a translator. I like to help Canadian people from my heart. Earl Lee called the master tailor's masterly repair an incredible act of kindness from a complete stranger who had only stepped foot in this country days ago.

Stephen O'Brien, the United Nations' head of Humanitarian Affairs, said this week that the Syrian city is, quote, \"well into its terrible descent into the pitiless and merciless abyss of a humanitarian catastrophe. \"Bombing by Russia intensified in the city. Over the past week, it killed hundreds of people. Secretary of State John Kerry struggled toward diplomatic solutions with his Russian counterparts to no result. Erika Solomon is a reporter for the Financial Times who's covered the war in Syria and joins us from Beirut. Thanks for being with us. ERIKA SOLOMON: Thanks for having me. SIMON: As you can piece it together, how do you describe daily life in Aleppo? SOLOMON: One of the things that I found really interesting in my reporting this week was I stepped away from the bombing - which, as we all know, is absolutely horrific - to try and figure out exactly what it is that it's like to get through a day in Aleppo. And it was actually kind of stunning talking to people about the moment they wake up and realizing how much time they could calculate they had to get things like water and food. These are things that aren't a given right now in Aleppo because of the siege that has been imposed on the rebel-held areas of Aleppo. If you can imagine, on top of bombings that don't usually stop until anywhere from 4 to 6 in the morning and you get a break til, maybe, 10 in the morning, you get four to five hours of sleep. And then you start your day looking for medicine, food, water, whatever it is that you don't have. SIMON: How do they eat? SOLOMON: Most of the things people are eating are things like pasta, rice, bulgur wheat - things that they've stored up, canned foods. Strangely, one of the few vegetables that are available is eggplant, and I asked a lot of residents why that is. And it seems that early on, when residents got the sense that there was going to be a siege, they started trying to grow vegetables. And apparently, eggplant is easy to grow in an urban setting, and it grows quickly. So I spoke to a lot of people who are very tired of eating eggplant. And other than that, the only type of green vegetable you might find would maybe be mint or parsley because that's things that you can easily grow - and even that is running short. I spoke to people who were saying that they were already down to two meals a day, and they knew a lot of people who were eating just one, if that. One of the most heartbreaking moments for me this week was talking to people who described, you know, having to share bread with neighbors that had run out of food and had had to sort of go up to them and say, I'm so sorry, but I haven't eaten in two days. Can you share some bread with me? So if you can imagine people really kind of losing any sense of hope from the skies, from the bombings or even, you know, from just the ability to feed themselves or their children. SIMON: Yeah. How do you talk to people in Aleppo, Erika? SOLOMON: Most of us are actually speaking on mobile texting apps, like WhatsApp. So the first thing you do when you wake up - before you try and get water, before you try and get bread - is just to check the WhatsApp groups that you've created with friends and colleagues to find out what's going on in the city and where is being bombed and what that might mean for the place that you're living in. And for me as a journalist, it means that's the way I speak to them as well. They'll send me messages, videos, pictures. And I kind of try and build a picture of what's going on from those communications. SIMON: Do you have any idea how many doctors might be left in Aleppo and if they have supplies? SOLOMON: The World Health Organization says there's about 35 doctors left in Aleppo. The first thing that's really going right now is the machinery. You need generators. So when some of the bombs started hitting this week, suddenly, oxygen machines couldn't work. And doctors described having to make choices, essentially, about who will live and who will die - choosing between a 70-year-old who needed some kind of treatment and a 3-year-old who, you know, had a whole life ahead of him. And then they have to go and tell people that they've made these choices. So if you can imagine that as well as another really kind of heartbreaking element of what's going on there. SIMON: Have people in Aleppo - well, do they no longer look to the outside world for help? SOLOMON: I think that they do really want to get their message out. There's a level of cynicism that is sometimes hard to bear really just watching it as a journalist because everything to them, at this point, seems like a conspiracy. And everything seems like something being done intentionally against them. But obviously, as one of the outsiders, it's hard. There is a sense of resentment there of what they're going through and this feeling that the world has let them down. And that can lead somewhere because, as you probably know, there is an issue with jihadist militant groups in northern Syria, in the rebel-held territories. And that's where these sympathies often end up heading when they feel that the world is ignoring them. SIMON: Erika Solomon of the Financial Times, thanks so much for being with us. SOLOMON: Thank you. SCOTT SIMON, HOST:  The world is running short of startling language to describe the situation in Aleppo.

These are things that aren't a given right now in Aleppo because of the siege that has been imposed on the rebel-held areas of Aleppo. If you can imagine, on top of bombings that don't usually stop until anywhere from 4 to 6 in the morning and you get a break til, maybe, 10 in the morning, you get four to five hours of sleep. And then you start your day looking for medicine, food, water, whatever it is that you don't have. SIMON: How do they eat? SOLOMON: Most of the things people are eating are things like pasta, rice, bulgur wheat - things that they've stored up, canned foods. Strangely, one of the few vegetables that are available is eggplant, and I asked a lot of residents why that is. And it seems that early on, when residents got the sense that there was going to be a siege, they started trying to grow vegetables. And apparently, eggplant is easy to grow in an urban setting, and it grows quickly. So I spoke to a lot of people who are very tired of eating eggplant. And other than that, the only type of green vegetable you might find would maybe be mint or parsley because that's things that you can easily grow - and even that is running short. I spoke to people who were saying that they were already down to two meals a day, and they knew a lot of people who were eating just one, if that. One of the most heartbreaking moments for me this week was talking to people who described, you know, having to share bread with neighbors that had run out of food and had had to sort of go up to them and say, I'm so sorry, but I haven't eaten in two days. Can you share some bread with me? So if you can imagine people really kind of losing any sense of hope from the skies, from the bombings or even, you know, from just the ability to feed themselves or their children. SIMON: Yeah. How do you talk to people in Aleppo, Erika? SOLOMON: Most of us are actually speaking on mobile texting apps, like WhatsApp. So the first thing you do when you wake up - before you try and get water, before you try and get bread - is just to check the WhatsApp groups that you've created with friends and colleagues to find out what's going on in the city and where is being bombed and what that might mean for the place that you're living in. And for me as a journalist, it means that's the way I speak to them as well. They'll send me messages, videos, pictures. And I kind of try and build a picture of what's going on from those communications. SIMON: Do you have any idea how many doctors might be left in Aleppo and if they have supplies? SOLOMON: The World Health Organization says there's about 35 doctors left in Aleppo. The first thing that's really going right now is the machinery. You need generators. So when some of the bombs started hitting this week, suddenly, oxygen machines couldn't work. And doctors described having to make choices, essentially, about who will live and who will die - choosing between a 70-year-old who needed some kind of treatment and a 3-year-old who, you know, had a whole life ahead of him. And then they have to go and tell people that they've made these choices. So if you can imagine that as well as another really kind of heartbreaking element of what's going on there. SIMON: Have people in Aleppo - well, do they no longer look to the outside world for help? SOLOMON: I think that they do really want to get their message out. There's a level of cynicism that is sometimes hard to bear really just watching it as a journalist because everything to them, at this point, seems like a conspiracy. And everything seems like something being done intentionally against them. But obviously, as one of the outsiders, it's hard. There is a sense of resentment there of what they're going through and this feeling that the world has let them down. And that can lead somewhere because, as you probably know, there is an issue with jihadist militant groups in northern Syria, in the rebel-held territories. And that's where these sympathies often end up heading when they feel that the world is ignoring them. SIMON: Erika Solomon of the Financial Times, thanks so much for being with us.

For more than 2,000 years, a hallmark of Rosh Hashanah has been the blowing of the shofar, a ram's horn. It's piercing call, so reminiscent of the work of BJ Leiderman who writes our theme music, called people together in ancient times. Now, as Judith Kogan reports, the shofar makes house calls. JUDITH KOGAN, BYLINE: The sound of the shofar is meant to be jarring. (SOUNDBITE OF SHOFAR SOUNDING)KOGAN: Rabbi Leanna Moritt of New York's Roosevelt Island Jewish Congregation explains. LEANNA MORITT: We're asked to take stock of our life, to compare our is and our ought. And in that way, the shofar works as a tool - it's like a wake-up call. KOGAN: This shofar is also said to express the cry for which there are no words. As Rabbi Chaim Prus of Beth Menachem Chabad in Newton, Mass. , reflects. . . CHAIM PRUS: It's not a beautiful instrument. It's not a beautiful, musical sound. But it really comes from the depth of the heart and the soul. KOGAN: Jews who attend synagogue services will hear several distinct calls - the single moan of Tekiah. . . (SOUNDBITE OF SHOFAR SOUNDING TEKIAH)KOGAN: . . . The three shorter blasts of Shevarim, the sound of sighing or trembling. . . (SOUNDBITE OF SHOFAR SOUNDING SHEVARIM)KOGAN: . . . And the nine staccato blasts of Teruah, the uncontrollable sob. (SOUNDBITE OF SHOFAR SOUNDING TERUAH)KOGAN: Not everyone goes to synagogue, though. Formerly tight-knit Jewish communities have splintered, and many Jews are less religious than their parents and grandparents were. So the shofar, which used to call people to it, is now being taken to them says Rabbi Mark Sokoll, president of the Jewish Community Center of Greater Boston. MARK SOKOLL: It's a central theme of our time, meeting people where they are at. Synagogues, Jewish community centers have had to become much more nimble and flexible in our thinking. KOGAN: So during the month before Rosh Hashanah, Rabbi Leanna Moritt travels New Jersey and blew a shofar for those too elderly or infirm to attend synagogue. She says that sound is meant to help them take stock of their entire lives. MORITT: The shofar can help them connect the dots of different experiences or remind them of things that have been meaningful in their lives. (SOUNDBITE OF DOOR KNOCKER)MORITT: Hello. KOGAN: Brooklyn-born-and-bred Florence Holtzman is 92 and living in a one-room apartment in Hoboken. I brought my shofar. FLORENCE HOLTZMAN: Oh. MORITT: Yeah. HOLTZMAN: Are you going to blow it? MORITT: You bet you. KOGAN: An only child of refugees from Austria, she never married. She can hardly walk now, but hearing Moritt's shofar reminds her of her childhood during the Great Depression. HOLTZMAN: It used to be if you were Jewish, you didn't say you were - kept it quiet - but not now, not here. You have to be proud of what you are, and I certainly am proud. KOGAN: But in the Ukraine, Boris and Ina Sultanovich had to hide who they were. (SOUNDBITE OF DOORBELL)BORIS SULTANOVICH: Oh, hi. MORITT: Hi. B. SULTANOVICH: How are you? KOGAN: Boris remembers that when his father died, he had to say Kaddish, the Jewish prayer for the dead, at 5 a. m. , under the cover of darkness. The Sultanoviches emigrated in 1982, and Boris describes the first time he heard shofar in the United States. B. SULTANOVICH: Oh, it was such a experience. We had such feelings that finally we don't have to hide our Jewishness because over there in Soviet Union, people suffered a lot. KOGAN: Boris's wife, Ina, is hunched over in a wheelchair. She can't really get to synagogue. When Moritt pulls out her shofar, Ina's twinkling blue eyes convey a longing. INA SULTANOVICH: Can you blow? MORITT: Yeah (laughter). (SOUNDBITE OF SHOFAR SOUNDING TEKIAH)I. SULTANOVICH: I like it. I like it. I like it. (LAUGHTER)KOGAN: And with that, Moritt packs away her shofar and wishes them Shana Tova, Hebrew for good year. MORITT: That sound can help them to find more peace because, really, at a certain point in your life, that's often what it is that people are searching most for - a sense that their lives haven't been in vain, that they've made a difference, that they're still vital.

Rabbi Julia Neuberger has made use of a law that allows descendants of people who were stripped of their German citizenship by the Nazis to have it reinstated. Rabbi Julia Neuberger, who is senior rabbi at West London's reformed synagogue and is also the Baroness Neuberger and a member of Britain's House of Lords, joins us from the BBC. Thanks so much for being with us. JULIA NEUBERGER: I'm just delighted to be with you. SIMON: Let me try and understand this. Is this a German passport to the exclusion of British citizenship? NEUBERGER: No, no. I'm a member of the House of Lords, and I'm a proud British citizen. And, you know, if you want to meet monarchists, I'm about as monarchist as you can get. Now, I'm absolutely a proud Brit. But I do want a German passport as well, which we're able to have, because I want to be able to travel freely throughout Europe. And I do feel that my ancestry is European. All four of my grandparents were German, and my mother and her parents came to this country before the war as refugees, and Britain was wonderful to them. But now that I discover I am entitled to a German passport as well as my British one - I'm a proud British subject - that's what I'm going to do. SIMON: Is your decision impelled, or at least hastened, by the vote on Brexit? NEUBERGER: Oh, absolutely. I'm not sure I'd have done it if it hadn't been for that. Indeed, it was my son who got particularly concerned and particularly felt strongly as that he wanted to go for a German passport. So it's not only just me as my mother's daughter, but it's also her grandchildren who can apply. And so once we've found some documents that I've been looking for and I know I've got somewhere, we will actually put in a formal application. But apparently, the German embassy here in London has been flooded with applications. SIMON: Yeah. We were told about 400 British Jews have already applied for German passports. NEUBERGER: Yes, and a lot more in the wings who are doing what I'm doing, trying to find the documents. SIMON: You are a well-known personage in Great Britain, and I wonder if - what kind of reaction you've received from people. NEUBERGER: I was expecting to have a very hostile reaction from some of the survivors and some of the refugees who are still alive. Actually, I was at a conference for the Association of Jewish Refugees here in Britain speaking - in fact, speaking about some of this as well, thinking that some of the older people there would have a real go at me. What was fascinating was that, although most of them, in their 90s, don't want to have German citizenship back, they were saying that their children and grandchildren are also applying. SIMON: I try to be careful with questions that are premised on what someone who is gone would think. But I'm going to chance one in your case. If your parents were here, what do you think they'd make of your decision? NEUBERGER: I've been thinking about that a great deal. And my mother only went back to Germany once, and she only went back when my father said - my father was born in Britain - when my father said to her, Liesel, if you don't go to Germany now, I won't be alive, and I won't be able to come with you. And she went back. And she had an amazing time, and she saw her all old school friends. And what would she have felt? I think she'd have felt ambivalent, to be honest. My father would have just been completely relaxed about it, I think. But it's been very interesting because my son feels very strongly that he wants German citizenship. My daughter's not at all sure. She can't see it, and she just says, you know, why would you want it, given the history? But I have to say Germans - unlike, I think, other countries that were responsible for the Holocaust, Germans have tried to come to terms. They teach it. They are doing what they can. We can't forgive the perpetrators. How can we? The people who died are not alive to do the forgiveness. But nevertheless, I think the Germans have made a huge effort, and I admire them hugely for the number of migrants and refugees that they've taken in. And it was partly that that swung my decision.

Airstrikes and bombs by both sides have led to an appalling milestone this weekend. Nearly 100 children have been killed since Friday, that according to the United Nations Children's Fund or UNICEF. We reached UNICEF Deputy Executive Director Justin Forsyth in New York to talk more about this. Hello, Mr. Forsyth. JUSTIN FORSYTH: Hello. MARTIN: Now, you've said that the suffering and the shock among children is definitely the worst that we have seen. How has it gotten so bad? FORSYTH: Well, the violence in Aleppo is just horrific. I mean, not only 100 children being killed, but over 200 have been injured. Children huddle in cellars every night, fearful for their lives, with their families. I just heard this morning that the water is being cut off again for the whole of Aleppo. The fighting around two of the pumping stations has led to both the east and the west being without water again, which leads to water-borne diseases. So the attacks, the bombing, the mortar fire, the shelling actually from both sides has led to this devastating situation. MARTIN: The governments of Russia and Syria say that they are only targeting rebel forces in Aleppo and not civilians. Do these images that we are seeing suggest something else? FORSYTH: Well, we've seen attacks on hospitals and we've seen water pumping stations being attacked. Whether it's deliberate or inadvertent, by dropping such bombs on these areas you're going to have huge casualties. This is a very built-up area. And we've seen also the rebels fire rockets and mortars. Children were killed yesterday in western Aleppo from rebel attacks. So nobody is without blame in this situation. And what we're saying is we need a cease-fire. I mean, we've got to a state where this is like a medieval siege. Water is turned off, food is running out and the medical facilities have been attacked. Eight convoys have been bombed and eight workers killed. So we're having a catastrophic situation. This is a living nightmare for the children living in Aleppo. MARTIN: In a war, which this is, I think most people would expect to see - and I'm not celebrating this, but I am simply saying that in a war, one might expect to see a larger population of adult males being killed. Why is it that children seem to be bearing the brunt of this? Why are there so many children in this area? FORSYTH: There's a lot of children in Aleppo. Some of them have been displaced from other parts of Syria. Also, the types of explosives that are being used in these built-up areas - and we've seen this in other conflicts - hurt and kill children particularly because they're more vulnerable. We're also seeing the psychological impact on these children. I mean, many are so frightened that they shake physically. And also, their moms and dads are feeling that fear. We've seen a big rise in suicide rates. So the combination of all of these factors - of malnutrition, of the bombing, of the mortar attacks, of the shelling - particularly hurt children. But they also hurt moms who are weak from malnutrition. MARTIN: U. S. Secretary of State John Kerry on Wednesday warned that the United States would stop talking to Moscow about ending the civil war unless Moscow stops the airstrikes in Aleppo. Does UNICEF have other recommendations about how the U. S. should be responding right now? FORSYTH: Well, we're a humanitarian actor on the ground working in Aleppo, so we have to be very careful not to take sides. We're to say to all the different sides of this conflict is to firstly allow the evacuation of these very injured children - hundreds of them in eastern Aleppo. They need emergency help. Ultimately, we need an end to the war. But even in the midst of this conflict, we can stop murdering children. And we should be honest - this is murdering children. Children are being bombed. They're being mortared. And on both sides of this conflict, children are being killed, so we need to stop firing these mortars or dropping these bombs in built-up areas. MARTIN: Justin Forsyth is the deputy executive director of UNICEF, the United Nations Children's Fund. As he described, it's a humanitarian organization which provides aid to children and their mothers in developing nations. He was kind enough to join us from New York. Mr. Forsyth, thank you so much for speaking with us. FORSYTH: Thank you.

Does UNICEF have other recommendations about how the U. S. should be responding right now? FORSYTH: Well, we're a humanitarian actor on the ground working in Aleppo, so we have to be very careful not to take sides. We're to say to all the different sides of this conflict is to firstly allow the evacuation of these very injured children - hundreds of them in eastern Aleppo. They need emergency help. Ultimately, we need an end to the war. But even in the midst of this conflict, we can stop murdering children. And we should be honest - this is murdering children. Children are being bombed. They're being mortared. And on both sides of this conflict, children are being killed, so we need to stop firing these mortars or dropping these bombs in built-up areas. MARTIN: Justin Forsyth is the deputy executive director of UNICEF, the United Nations Children's Fund. As he described, it's a humanitarian organization which provides aid to children and their mothers in developing nations. He was kind enough to join us from New York. Mr. Forsyth, thank you so much for speaking with us. FORSYTH: Thank you.", "section": "World", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

They convey a mix of fatigue and resilience. For two weeks, forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad have attacked the rebel-held eastern side of the city. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says more than 300 civilians have died there. NPR's Alison Meuse spoke to people there who try to keep life going. ALISON MEUSE, BYLINE: For the past four years, opposition factions have controlled the eastern half of Aleppo. It's always been dangerous there, frequently bombed by the regime and its allies. But opposition leaders have tried to maintain a semblance of governance. I speak with Britta Haji Hassan, who's headed the opposition city council there for the past year. BRITTA HAJI HASSAN: (Through interpreter) There's the basic municipal services, then there's supervising education and health and overseeing the distribution of relief. MEUSE: Hassan is an engineer and father, who normally oversees 600 employees, managing schools, hospitals and food distribution. They even had a plan to grow food in the city's green spaces. But now, he says, they're facing an unprecedented air assault, and everything's changed. The morning I spoke with him, two hospitals were bombed. HASSAN: (Through interpreter) The situation is very, very hard. There's anxiety and horror, and we can't do anything about it. MEUSE: Now, he says, his focus is rescue work - clearing rubble from roads and distributing strictly rationed bread. He sounds overwhelmed, but determined to keep trying. Speaking with other Aleppans in these opposition areas who are trying to keep things running, that tone becomes familiar. Ahmad Deiri is an ambulance driver whose charity, Shafak, is supported by Save the Children. Just two weeks ago, he was leaving home on a rescue mission when his house got hit. AHMAD DEIRI: (Through interpreter) I was buried an hour under the rubble. MEUSE: His wife wasn't hurt, but she was eight months pregnant and gave birth prematurely. The baby clothes they'd bought were incinerated. Now, they're living with neighbors, and he's recovering from burns. But 24-year-old Deiri is eager to get back on the job. DEIRI: (Through interpreter) When you're working in the rebel areas, you really feel bad when you're not working. Say there's a bombing and a massacre, you don't feel you can sit at home. You want to go and help people. The people here are really impoverished - people without money, without anywhere else to live. MEUSE: Deiri says it's those people that keep him here. Another young man, who asked that his name be withheld so the regime won't target his family, tells NPR he used to distribute food delivered by an aid agency. But now, with his area under siege, there's no food to distribute. He fears people will soon go hungry. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: And they will be in really bad situation. They will not find food to eat. MEUSE: His parents have gone to safer areas, but he doesn't want to leave, even if he gets the chance. He's trying to figure out a new way to help - maybe join a rescue team or work at a hospital. He says, I hope I can do something. Alison Meuse, NPR News, Beirut. RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST:  Let's hear now voices from the divided city of Aleppo in Syria. They convey a mix of fatigue and resilience.

UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: Does my life feel sustainable - no. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #3: You're rushing to get home for your child care. You're not sleeping well. You're probably not eating well.

UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #5: I feel like I have three full-time jobs - yes. MCEVERS: The big reason why life is so hard for many new parents is they often have to rush back to work after having their baby mostly because they don't have paid leave, and they can't afford to go long without a paycheck. All of this makes the United States an outlier. It is the only developed country without a national paid leave law. And that made us wonder what new parents outside the U. S. have come to expect. So ALL THINGS CONSIDERED producer Jessica Deahl went to find out. JESSICA DEAHL, BYLINE: The story of how paid parental leave became adopted by most of the world started more than a hundred years ago. That's according to Jody Heymann of UCLA's World Policy Analysis Center. JODY HEYMANN: Beginning in the 1800s with the Industrial Revolution, when women started to go into the formal workforce, leaving working at home to working in factories, countries realized they needed to do something. And they started to pass paid maternity leave. DEAHL: Heymann says this happened in Europe, in Latin America, and later, representatives from all over the world got together and agreed to international standards on paid leave - just not the U. S. So what does this difference in national policy mean when it comes to the real life experience of a new parent? To answer that, I called up a bunch of moms and dads outside the U. S. I found a lot of Europeans who wanted to talk about this. BRIGITTE BELTRE: Hi, my name is Brigitte. I live in Toulouse, France. When I had my second child, I left six weeks before the birth as any mom would do. And afterwards, I stayed with him for one year. I was receiving, like, 65 to 70 percent of my full salary, and I would get my job back as soon as my maternity leave was over. DEAHL: So coming from France, that might not be terribly surprising. But I also heard this from a mom in China. MENG MENG: My Chinese name is Meng Meng. I'm living in Shengjin, a big city in south China. In China, mothers will have four months to five months maternity leave, fully paid. DEAHL: And in India, new moms get three months fully paid unless you work for the government like this next mom. She got even more time. MEDULA: My name is Medula (ph), and I live in a state in India that is Orissa. So when my son was born, I was paid 100 percent of my salary, and I got 180 days of leave. DEAHL: And finally, our neighbors to the north similar to us in so many ways are wildly different when it comes to paid parental leave. TATIANA MELLEMA: My name is Tatiana, and I live in Vancouver in Canada. When my son was born two years ago, I was working at the Vancouver Art Gallery. The leave that I got - it was for a full year. And as part of the leave, the government would pay about 40 percent of my wage at the gallery. DEAHL: By this point, you might be thinking, this cannot be cheap. BELTRE: You have to know that it's not for free. DEAHL: That's Brigitte Beltre of France. BELTRE: In France, you have to work a certain amount of time to have paid maternity leave. You have to give to the system. It's like a savings account. DEAHL: So in a lot of the world, the leave is paid for through a social insurance fund. It's kind of like Social Security in the U. S. This is one of the most common arrangements, and it's how they do it in Canada, too. Tatiana Mellema in Vancouver told us being able to dip into that fund gave her enough time to bounce back from giving birth and care for her new baby at his most vulnerable stage. MELLEMA: The financial support was essential to getting us through that year and to giving me that time with him. Had I not have had it, I would have probably had to have gone back to work fairly quickly after I had him, which I can't even imagine doing at that point because my experience of just having that year with him was just so important. DEAHL: Over the years, a few countries have added paid paternity leave, too. And I talked to a few dads about that, like, Per Einarsson of Stockholm, Sweden. New parents there get about 16 months of paid time off to divvy up between them. Per and his partner, Kristina, split that time off evenly. And he says that time helped him be a more engaged dad. PER EINARSSON: It was nice to be educated, if you may, to learn how to take care of my children and to bond with them. And then of course it was nice to give Kristina the possibility to get back to her job and focus on her career as well. DEAHL: Their kids are now 3 and 5 years old, and he says that time off set a tone in their home. EINARSSON: I think in their eyes we were always very equal to them and still are. DEAHL: Now, most countries don't offer equal leave to men and women. Policies around the world tend to be mom-centric, and I heard over and over again about one unintended downside - when moms get or take more paid leave than dads, it can make it harder for women to get hired or promoted. Lama Dossary is from Saudi Arabia. Women there get 10 weeks of paid time off. Dad's get three days. Dossary says when she went back to her job at an oil company after her baby was born, she had a hard time. LAMA DOSSARY: When I went back, I did feel like it did affect how I was looked at, how I was treated. My promotions kind of got stopped for a while. I wasn't given the same amount of work. I wasn't given the same amount of responsibility. I don't know how it would affect things, but I do think that maybe if other people were able to take such leaves off, whether to take care of their older parents or, you know, a father maybe has to take some time off because he has a child that needs special care for a while - I think that would at least change the perception. DEAHL: So that's some of what I heard from moms and dads outside the U. S. Now, when Jody Heymann of UCLA looks out at the global picture, she does see one way the U. S. is out front. The American Family and Medical Leave Act offers unpaid but job-protected leave equally to moms and dads and to others, like those caring for an ill parent. HEYMANN: That's a good basis. The problem is, the fact that it's unpaid means it's unaffordable to many Americans. And all of the caveats that come with the Family Medical Leave Act that have to do with how many hours you've worked, how big your employer is, et cetera, mean that millions of Americans aren't covered. DEAHL: But there's talk of change. Both major party presidential candidates have expressed support to varying degrees for national paid leave programs. So it's possible the days of the U. S. being a global outlier on this are numbered. Jessica Diehl, NPR News.

Tens of thousands of people were displaced because their homes were destroyed. The death toll is in the hundreds and is growing. U. N. officials are calling it Haiti's worst humanitarian crisis since the earthquake that struck six years ago. We wanted to hear more, so we reached Joshua Partlow. He's Mexico City bureau chief for The Washington Post, but he was able to get to Les Cayes, Haiti, which is on the south on the Caribbean coast. Joshua, thanks so much for joining us. JOSHUA PARTLOW: Thank you. MARTIN: So what is the extent of the damage that you've seen so far? And we're hearing very different casualty figures. So can you shed some light on that as well? PARTLOW: Yeah, sure. And the extent of the damage from what I've seen has been pretty massive. I flew into the country from the Dominican Republic on a helicopter with a medical group a couple of days ago. And you could see a lot of houses had been destroyed, roofs torn off, I mean, thousands. There's a lot of flooding along the southern coast of Haiti. You could see signs of the storm surge. And in the towns I've explored since, on the ground, I mean, it's just only looked worse. I'm in Les Cayes, which is one of the main towns along the southern coast. But in the remote villages all up and down the coast, there are these palm tree groves, and the trees have been knocked over by the wind and smashed these houses that are, you know, made of cinder blocks with tin roofs or sometimes thatch huts. So there's a lot of devastation. There're roads that have been washed out and blocked by trees, and there have been bridges that have been washed out as well. So it's hard to access a lot of these areas. MARTIN: What is the government saying as far as loss of life, and why are there different figures coming out? PARTLOW: The death toll has been rising pretty much every day since the storm. Right now the government has confirmed about 400 deaths. A news organization has published their own independent tally that puts it more than 800. It's just hard to determine because I've heard estimates that half a million people just along the southern coastline haven't even been reached outsiders yet because their towns and villages are cut off, you know, only accessible by helicopter, basically. And the phone lines have been cut as well, so communication is difficult. So that's why you're not seeing a good solid number about how many people have died in the storm. MARTIN: Now, you mentioned that you were able to fly in with a medical aid group. Are aid and relief efforts able to get underway at this point? PARTLOW: There have been some. There are supplies coming in. The Western aid groups have given medicine to some clinics, but no, I mean, it's not a very robust relief effort so far. I mean, people are - who have been - had their homes destroyed - are now staying in makeshift shelters. I was in a school today where more than 1,200 hundred people are camping out. I mean, all of them that I talked to said their homes were damaged or destroyed. They've had one shipment of rice at the school in a week, they said. And one presidential candidate is here, who's known as - he's a banana businessman - had delivered a truckload of bananas. So you know, there's - they're hungry, people are worried about cholera, people are worried about fresh water. So it's really elemental needs at this point. MARTIN: Haiti had been scheduled to hold elections this Sunday, as I understand it. What is going to happen with that? PARTLOW: Yeah, so the election got postponed after the storm, and there's no date that's been set for a new election at this point. That presidential candidate I talked about - Jovenel Moise - he had arrived in Les Cayes yesterday. He toured the South and then delivered some food and fruit, like I mentioned, to some people down here. He's one of the leading candidates. He was hoping that the election will happen as soon as possible. But, you know, he fears that the government will postpone the election indefinitely, and there's already been, you know, more than a year of uncertainty about who the elected president is here.

He served as an adviser to secretaries of state of both Republican and Democratic administrations. Aaron, thanks very much for being back with us. AARON DAVID MILLER: A pleasure to be here. SIMON: Did Russia use those talks between Russia and the U. S. - did the Assad regime use them to buy time while they destroyed Aleppo and other areas? MILLER: I mean, now in hindsight, I don't think there's any doubt that Putin used phony cease-fire talks as a sort of clever way to allow Moscow to keep one hand in diplomacy and to calibrate it but also to keep its feet on the Syrian battlefield in defense of Assad. SIMON: Is it worthwhile to make another attempt to talk to Russia? MILLER: You know, I think Mr. Putin is most comfortable, frankly, when he has a diplomatic process going and a military process on the ground. He fashions himself not simply a combatant but a broker and a mediator and a great power. It is high time that the United States remove right now this sort of Potemkin Village fraud in which Mr. Putin seems to have the best of both worlds. Pull it away, keep the focus on Vladimir Putin as aggressor, tar him with the responsibility and the Assads for the humanitarian catastrophe and don't give him the legitimacy to argue that in fact he can play both on the battlefield and in the diplomatic corridors of Geneva and New York. SIMON: There have been reports again that the administration's considering applying more U. S. military power in the region. How do you feel about that? MILLER: You know, I think it's late for the U. S. to intercede, and I think this administration largely in response to its predecessor has clearly determined that it needs to be very cautious and risk averse on Syria. You could implement any number of what I would argue are half measures - no-fly zones, demilitarized area safe zones, humanitarian corridors. You could supply more sophisticated weapons to the rebels. You could attack Assad directly. And I think the one question I would ask is Putin, Assad, the Iranians, Hezbollah, are prepared to die in defense of their national interests in Syria. And the question, really, Scott, is are we? If in fact Congress is willing to empower the president, the American public is prepared for a major investment in another Middle Eastern war in the wake of Iraq and Afghanistan, then sure, make Syria a major priority - perhaps the priority. But it's not just the day-after problem for the United States in Syria. It's the decade-after problem. SIMON: At the same time, isn't there a cost, even a lot of cost, for doing nothing? MILLER: I think that Obama will be judged very harshly as a consequence of his failure to do more. So yes, there is a cost, but I would argue to you that with respect to humanitarian interventions, this is not just a Barack Obama problem. From the Nazi Holocaust to Cambodia to Rwanda to Darfur to Congo, the United States simply does not have, for any number of reasons, a consistent or terribly uplifting record in terms of interceding in conflicts which involve mass slaughter and mass killing.

The one place in the judicial system where it remains hard to take legal action is against individual countries. They're covered by what's known as sovereign immunity. This week, Jason Rezaian, The Washington Post reporter who was imprisoned by the Iranian government for 544 days, filed suit with his family against Iran for what they called irreparable harm due to torture and other cruel treatment. Now, this comes after Congress passed a law overriding President Obama's veto that permits the families of those killed in the attacks of 9/11 to sue Saudi Arabia for financing the hijackers. How do you go about suing a country? Stephen Vladeck is a professor of law at the University of Texas. He specializes in U. S. foreign relations law. Thanks very much for being with us, Professor. STEPHEN VLADECK: Thanks for having me. SIMON: So sovereign immunity, what does that mean? VLADECK: It's the basic background principle that countries have special protection in both their own courts and the courts of their sister and, you know, brother countries around the world. And it basically requires individual countries to make exceptions before other countries can be brought into that country's courts. SIMON: And that law is there for what reason? VLADECK: So I think the idea is sort of twofold. First, that you don't necessarily want the courts of one country being the first movers when it comes to setting foreign policy. And so we prefer that disputes between sovereigns really be resolved at the diplomatic stage as opposed to the private civil litigation stage. And second, I think the reciprocity piece of it is a very important idea, that otherwise you'd have a race to the bottom where countries would hail each other into each other's courts. So it's all just to sort of protect and preserve friendly relations between countries that at least usually are on friendly terms with each other. SIMON: I know we can't prejudge these things, but would the Iranian government have to provide testimony in a U. S. court? VLADECK: Countries take different positions over how they litigate cases. Some just never show up. And so you'll have a default judgment entered against them. Some litigate these cases. SIMON: (Unintelligible) Collecting it. VLADECK: Right. But then the - and so the real question at the end of the day is not whether you can get a judgment against a foreign country but whether you can enforce it, whether you can actually collect the damages that a federal court might say you're entitled to. SIMON: We're told about the case of Terry Anderson. He was held hostage in Lebanon. He received a sum that's reported to be in the neighborhood of $26 million, right? VLADECK: That's right. SIMON: When Terry Anderson won that judgment, he was also fortunate enough, though, to be suing at a time when the United States had a lot of Iranian assets locked up here. VLADECK: Indeed. And so when the assets are here on U. S. soil, the question is not whether the federal courts have the power to seize them. They unquestionably do. The question is simply whether those assets are accessible to the court or whether they've already been frozen by the executive branch. And we've actually seen in the specific case of Iran Congress several times intercede to open up assets seized by the president to be used to satisfy judgments in these kinds of cases. SIMON: Of course, the Rezaian case is being filed at a time when the United States is eager to get Iran to curtail its nuclear development and therefore might be less inclined to seize any assets. VLADECK: Indeed. I mean, I think the issue that arises in cases like the Rezaian case is not whether the case will get to a judgment. It almost certainly will. The question is simply if he actually wins and obtains the money judgment, is the U. S. government going to have any interest in releasing some of the Iranian assets that they have already seized and frozen to satisfy that judgment? SIMON: The 9/11 families can now sue Saudi Arabia. Reportedly, though, Congress has what amounts to veto override remorse. VLADECK: Yeah. I mean, I think - the bill that Congress passed last week over President Obama's veto is, I think, a really interesting example of this phenomenon because, on the one hand, you have a very strong lobby pushing to open the courthouse doors. On the other hand, because of the U. S. government does not treat Saudi Arabia as a state sponsor of terrorism, it's actually unprecedented to allow these kinds of claims as a waiver of foreign sovereign immunity. That's where all the diplomatic relations concerns come from and where at least I think some of Congress' buyer's remorse comes from. So it's a very difficult tightrope to navigate. And so that's why the reciprocity concern is such a dominant and pervasive theme of debates over foreign sovereign immunity because the last thing that you want is a race to the bottom.

A massive boom followed as South Africans and foreigners alike mined the world's richest gold deposit. That was then. Today, gold mining companies, the powerhouses of South Africa's economy, are in the midst of a 20-year decline in production. But as Peter Granitz reports, illegal miners are heading underground. PETER GRANITZ, BYLINE: The way James Moyo tells it, he's an expert at getting valuable things out of the ground. JAMES MOYO: Gold, nickel, diamond, everything. GRANITZ: Moyo says he mined it all in his native Zimbabwe, but he left for a better life in South Africa, migrating illegally in 2010. After piecing together odd jobs, he turned once again to the mines in 2014. MOYO: Zimbabwe, there is no money. There is no job. At least if I'm coming here, I've got something. GRANITZ: He says the price of gold fluctuates. This day, he thinks he can get 540 rands a gram. That's about $38 U. S. Moyo spends two nights a week underground, descending 100-year-old tunnels, squeezing through tiny holes and, working in the light of a headlamp, pick stones out of walls and pillars in the mine. MOYO: And then we crush and then we crush and then we crush. GRANITZ: And once above ground, he says it's easy to find black market buyers in the poor townships near the mines. Moyo is a zama zama, the local term for illegal miners. He and countless others mine shafts deemed no longer profitable to mining companies. It's inherently dangerous, and the South African government is trying unsuccessfully to crack down. Department of Mineral Resources Minister Mosebenzi Zwane says the government has arrested 800 zama zamas has this year. MOSEBENZI ZWANE: Most of the people who are here involved in illegal mining activities are not even South African citizen. Some of them are even under the age of 12 years. GRANITZ: Zwane had just suspended a rescue operation at the Langlaagte mine shaft in Johannesburg. This is where gold was found in 1886 and set off the whole bonanza. Companies stopped mining here more than 20 years ago, but at any given time, you can find zamas coming out of the shafts and ventilation holes up and down the Witwatersrand Basin, the rock formation that once held the world's healthiest gold deposits. It stretches for dozens of miles south, east and west of Joburg. There's a police station across the street from the Langlaagte shaft. Daroh Tsikwe's brothers Sibangani died in a recent underground fire at Langlaagte. Sibangani lost his job as a gardener the previous month and turned to the mine to make ends meet. He died on his maiden trip underground. The Tsikwe brothers are also from Zimbabwe. Daroh, who stopped mining in 2013 when he found work as a truck driver, says desperation forces unemployed men underground. DAROH TSIKWE: More than 2,000 people entering in this mine - more than 2,000. GRANITZ: South Africa's Chamber of Mines, the trade association for the legal mining companies, says a surge in the gold price earlier this century led to an increase in illegal mining. Nash Lutchman, head of security for Sibanye, one of South Africa's largest gold producers, says multi-tier crime syndicates run illegal mining operations just like a business from the low-level zamas on up. NASH LUTCHMAN: When we're talking the organized crime syndicates, we are actually talking a real proper crime boss, Al Capone-type of syndicate. GRANITZ: He says the syndicates don't follow the environmental and safety precautions that his company has to. Back at Langlaagte, Moyo says he's preparing to go back in soon. He has a wife and three kids he needs to feed. MOYO: It's dangerous, but there is no choice. GRANITZ: The government of South Africa plans to seal up the Langlaagte shaft soon. That will do little to deter the zamas from entering elsewhere. For NPR News, I'm Peter Granitz in Johannesburg.

GRANITZ: Moyo says he mined it all in his native Zimbabwe, but he left for a better life in South Africa, migrating illegally in 2010. After piecing together odd jobs, he turned once again to the mines in 2014. MOYO: Zimbabwe, there is no money. There is no job. At least if I'm coming here, I've got something. GRANITZ: He says the price of gold fluctuates. This day, he thinks he can get 540 rands a gram. That's about $38 U. S. Moyo spends two nights a week underground, descending 100-year-old tunnels, squeezing through tiny holes and, working in the light of a headlamp, pick stones out of walls and pillars in the mine. MOYO: And then we crush and then we crush and then we crush. GRANITZ: And once above ground, he says it's easy to find black market buyers in the poor townships near the mines. Moyo is a zama zama, the local term for illegal miners. He and countless others mine shafts deemed no longer profitable to mining companies. It's inherently dangerous, and the South African government is trying unsuccessfully to crack down. Department of Mineral Resources Minister Mosebenzi Zwane says the government has arrested 800 zama zamas has this year. MOSEBENZI ZWANE: Most of the people who are here involved in illegal mining activities are not even South African citizen. Some of them are even under the age of 12 years. GRANITZ: Zwane had just suspended a rescue operation at the Langlaagte mine shaft in Johannesburg. This is where gold was found in 1886 and set off the whole bonanza. Companies stopped mining here more than 20 years ago, but at any given time, you can find zamas coming out of the shafts and ventilation holes up and down the Witwatersrand Basin, the rock formation that once held the world's healthiest gold deposits. It stretches for dozens of miles south, east and west of Joburg. There's a police station across the street from the Langlaagte shaft. Daroh Tsikwe's brothers Sibangani died in a recent underground fire at Langlaagte. Sibangani lost his job as a gardener the previous month and turned to the mine to make ends meet. He died on his maiden trip underground. The Tsikwe brothers are also from Zimbabwe. Daroh, who stopped mining in 2013 when he found work as a truck driver, says desperation forces unemployed men underground. DAROH TSIKWE: More than 2,000 people entering in this mine - more than 2,000. GRANITZ: South Africa's Chamber of Mines, the trade association for the legal mining companies, says a surge in the gold price earlier this century led to an increase in illegal mining. Nash Lutchman, head of security for Sibanye, one of South Africa's largest gold producers, says multi-tier crime syndicates run illegal mining operations just like a business from the low-level zamas on up. NASH LUTCHMAN: When we're talking the organized crime syndicates, we are actually talking a real proper crime boss, Al Capone-type of syndicate. GRANITZ: He says the syndicates don't follow the environmental and safety precautions that his company has to. Back at Langlaagte, Moyo says he's preparing to go back in soon. He has a wife and three kids he needs to feed. MOYO: It's dangerous, but there is no choice. GRANITZ: The government of South Africa plans to seal up the Langlaagte shaft soon. That will do little to deter the zamas from entering elsewhere. For NPR News, I'm Peter Granitz in Johannesburg.", "section": "World", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.

And according to a new report, from Amnesty International, just 10 countries are hosting more than half of them. The report finds that the world's wealthiest nations are doing little to address the refugee crisis, which is the worst one since World War II. Salil Shetty is the secretary general of Amnesty International. He joins me on the line from the BBC in London. Thanks so much for being with us. SALIL SHETTY: Thank you. MARTIN: Which countries have taken in the most refugees in this crisis? SHETTY: The crisis has got two, sort of, broad elements to it. On the one hand, it's, of course, what we see in the Middle East right now. So Syria is really what's been in the news a great deal. But let's not forget that there are some other long-term conflicts and crises, like Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia, Sudan. So if you think about these 10 countries, they're, essentially, the countries which are neighbors to the countries in conflict. So as far as the Syrian crisis is concerned, Turkey is, by far, the largest host for Syrian refugees. But Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq, all of these, host very large numbers of Syrian refugees. Eighty-six percent of the Syrian refugees, approximately, are in these neighboring countries. And then, if you look at Sudan, Somalia, then - you know, Kenya is one of the big host countries for the Somalia, Sudanese refugees. Also, if you take Afghanistan, Pakistan would be the single biggest and Iran as well. MARTIN: So how do you change that? I mean, how do you incentivize wealthier countries to take in more refugees? SHETTY: One of the early calls that Amnesty International made is that, you know, this is a global crisis of proportions we've not seen since the second world war. So it needs a global response. So finally, we had a leaders meeting of the United Nations just a couple of weeks ago. But unfortunately, it was a spectacular failure. There was not a single binding, precise target which came out of that. We need groups of countries who are more willing to come forward and start taking people in. Also, like - and we've seen this. Canada, for example, has already accepted 25,000 more Syrian refugees. Germany has accepted 1 million. So it's really boiled down to a leadership choice. The surveys we've done with the public, you know, it completely busts this myth that the local population in these rich countries don't want to accept refugees. Like, if you take the U. S. , for example, our surveys show that over 70 percent of the U. S. population do welcome refugees. In fact, 15 percent are ready to take them into their own houses. So I think it's indicative that, you know, the public is ahead of the leaders. MARTIN: Although you mentioned Germany, which, in Europe, has been the country to accept the most refugees from the Syrian conflict. The chancellor there, Angela Merkel, has suffered a real political hit because of that. SHETTY: She has, and there's no question about it. But, you know, you can't change things overnight. So we need long-term process of educating the population, getting them to hear the facts because what happens is that the third or so who are against refugees coming in are very vocal. And they're creating a whole atmosphere of fear, which is totally not based on the facts. I mean, one of the things I always tell people is that since I've spent time in these camps, I've not met a single woman, man or child who's told me, from Syria, that they would like to come to Europe. It's not a lifestyle choice, you know, to traverse the Mediterranean where thousands of people died through drownings. Or, you know - most of these European countries have signed on to the 1951 Refugee Convention, so they're simply in violation of that. MARTIN: When you talk about solutions to this, you say you just need more wealthy countries to be willing to resettle refugees. And you do point to Canada as a country that has been successful in that. They've taken in more than 30,000 Syrians since 2015, compared to the U. S. , which has taken in a little over 12,000 Syrian refugees. What is it about Canada's system that works? SHETTY: At the global level, the problem is we don't have a system. You know, right now, we have a completely ad hoc process where the neighboring countries simply end up carrying this burden for decades. So our proposal is that instead of 10 countries taking the load, can we share this across 60 to 90 countries on an objective basis - you know, depending on your size of your country, your population, your wealth? But in the case of Canada, it is really a political choice. We've been told that Canadians don't like refugees. They don't want refugees. So what happened suddenly - they suddenly changed their mind? That's not true. I mean, it was really Trudeau and, you know, their leadership. And they said that this is what Canadian values are about. And really, you know, the U. S. is another country where - it's a country that was created by people coming in from outside. I mean, if you look at what Ellis Island and the Statue of Liberty is all about, it's about creating a - you know, a diverse, inclusive country, which has become so powerful because of its diversity. But, you know, in practice, the U. S. is hardly taking anybody. MARTIN: What about aid, though? The United States, for example, has given more than $5 billion toward the Syrian refugee crisis. That's a lot of money. Is that not making a difference? SHETTY: So - I mean, absolutely it does. And don't forget, again, that, you know, a lot of these are pledges, you know, these announcements which come in meetings. You finally look at what the actual money that goes across - it's close to nothing. But the main point I'd make is, humanitarian financing, very important as it is, is not a substitute for resettling people and receiving refugees. MARTIN: Salil Shetty is the secretary general of Amnesty International. Thank you so much. SHETTY: Thank you.

A three-month state of emergency billed as a temporary measure has just been extended for another three months. NPR's Peter Kenyon reports that some Turks say their leaders are using emergency powers to bypass democratic checks and balances. PETER KENYON, BYLINE: When President Recep Tayyip Erdogan came before a gathering of neighborhood leaders recently, he knew what his audience wanted to hear. An extended state of emergency with more decrees and more purges? Bring it on. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)RECEP TAYYIP ERDOGAN: (Foreign language spoken). KENYON: \"We're in a race against time to root out terrorism,\" the president said. He added that three months wasn't nearly enough time. It could take as long as a year. In response to a question, he mused that maybe even a year wouldn't be long enough. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)ERDOGAN: (Foreign language spoken). (APPLAUSE)KENYON: The warm applause that greeted Erdogan's remarks was not just Turkish respect for a strong leader. Surveys show continued popular support for the government even as the purge reaches well beyond those suspected of actively supporting the coup. But worries about where Turkey is heading are beginning to grow. Istanbul's main commercial artery, Istiklal Street, still draws street musicians and crowds. But more and more shops are shuttered as the economy struggles. At a tiny sidewalk tea shop, columnist and author Mustafa Akyol says many Turks will continue to back the government as long as they believe it's trying to prevent another coup. But he says a growing minority fears the government is using the state of emergency to enact unpopular policy goals that have nothing to do with protecting Turkey's democracy. MUSTAFA AKYOL: Actually, the governor of Yozgat, a small city in the middle of Anatolia, he used the state of emergency to get rid of not terrorism but something much more innocent, which is alcoholic bars and clubs. And he said, actually, I couldn't do this in normal times. Now I have the power to do it. Well, that's precisely the point (laughter). That's precisely the point that if you give any government too much power, the government tends to do things that it fancies but that's not acceptable for some parts of the society. KENYON: Akyol finds another example disturbing, the recent closure of nearly two dozen small, left-wing or pro-Kurdish radio and TV outlets. Just up the street, I meet one of those journalists, newly out of a job. Eyup Borc is holding a sort of wake for IMC TV, where he was editor in chief when police moved in and silenced the channel's outspoken, left-wing broadcast. Borc sees the current situation as a struggle between a government bent on increasing its power and a steadily shrinking pro-Democratic opposition. EYUP BORC: (Through interpreter) The state of emergency is now targeting the democratic forces in society, not coup suspects. The coup that failed in July actually gave birth to a more successful coup, one that gets rid of opposing voices and allows for a more authoritarian government. KENYON: Borc doesn't agree with critics who say the post-coup purge is out of control. He says it's a determined and focused effort to silence dissent. But he's not defending the U. S. -based cleric Fethullah Gulen, who denies the government's charge that he backed the coup. BORC: (Through interpreter) If Fethullah Gulen had succeeded in the coup attempt, the result for us would have been exactly the same.

Many Chinese cope by sending their babies back to relatives in China. These satellite babies return to their parents in the U. S. when they're old enough to go to school. Beth Fertig of member station WNYC met some of them at a New York City elementary school. BETH FERTIG, BYLINE: It's the first day of kindergarten at P. S. 176 in Brooklyn, and the parents and children are crowded around tiny desks. But while most kids are already busy drawing, one girl with bangs and a ponytail has scrawled only a few little shapes. HONG ZHENG: She can't speak English. And she's been in America just three months. FERTIG: Her mother, 31-year-old Hong Zheng says Vivien was born here. But she took her to southeastern China when she was a few months old to live with grandparents in Fujian province. This way, she and her husband could keep working in a restaurant until Vivien started kindergarten. ZHENG: (Speaking Mandarin). FERTIG: WNYC producer Richard Yeh translated. RICHARD YEH, BYLINE: She says, \"As you know, in Fujian, we have a lot of these cases. \"FERTIG: Cases where kids are sent to grandparents because it's common in China for families to help out this way. Zheng says she cried for about a month after Vivien left. And she stayed in touch with her through video chats every day. She's happy to hold her child again, but Vivien now misses her family in China. ZHENG: (Speaking Mandarin). YEH: \"Every morning, she demands a video chat with Grandpa. Grandpa is the one who spoils her, and she asks for him every morning. \"FERTIG: Her principal, Liz Culkin, says more than two thirds of her students are Asian. She says many were sent to China and feel torn between two countries and two families. LIZ CULKIN: They're coming back to people that they basically don't know. FERTIG: Culkin says these students rarely speak English. Sometimes they cry more than usual or don't participate. CULKIN: They're always looking around to see who's there with them. And that - they always need that sense of knowing where they are and who is there to protect them. LOIS LEE: They're angry. Why did you send me away? How come my brother is here but you sent me away? FERTIG: Lois Lee is with the Chinese American Planning Council, which runs after school and day care programs. She's in charge of a site in Flushing, Queens, which has a big Chinese community. Researchers have found these satellite babies can suffer from attachment disorder and other mental health problems, though there aren't any long-term studies on how they turn out. Lee says more free day care could prevent families from sending children abroad. But in the meantime, she's trying to help by getting the kids to talk. LEE: Out of all the people in this room right now, how many were born in the United States and went back to China or to another country. . . FERTIG: Over the summer, Lee met with students going into fourth grade at a day camp run by her program. LEE: Eleven, 12, 13, 14, 15 - thank you very much. Now the children who had their hands raised, you know that is what we call the satellite babies. FERTIG: Everyone's heard this term before. And these 8 and 9-year-olds are able to talk pretty candidlyUNIDENTIFIED GIRL: I was, like, on a airport. My mom was, like, pulling my hand. I was like, (imitating sobbing) Grandpa, Grandma - why are you leave me now? And then my grandmother started crying. UNIDENTIFIED BOY #1: I felt angry. LEE: OK. What about you? UNIDENTIFIED BOY #2: I felt frustrated 'cause. . . LEE: Frustrated? UNIDENTIFIED BOY #2: Because I had been, like, with my grandma and grandpa, like, for three years. And I didn't even know that parents exist. FERTIG: We're not using any of the children's names because the families want to maintain their privacy. As the kids talk with Lee, she reminds them how far they've come. She recalls a boy they know who refused to go to class when he arrived in kindergarten. LEE: Every morning, I would see him. I would take his hand, and I would walk him to class. Maybe I was, like, the substitute mama or something, you know. (LAUGHTER)FERTIG: This helps. Chinese community groups have been holding parenting workshops, too. Schools are also very involved. VIVIEN: Daddy is running. FERTIG: At P. S. 176 in Brooklyn, Vivien is flipping through picture books in her bilingual Chinese kindergarten class. It's a few weeks after the start of school, and her teacher, Brenda Tang, says she's doing really well. She plans to encourage her mother to keep building on their relationship. That way, time apart doesn't have to be a permanent setback. For NPR News, I'm Beth Fertig in New York.

Grandpa is the one who spoils her, and she asks for him every morning. \" FERTIG: Her principal, Liz Culkin, says more than two thirds of her students are Asian. She says many were sent to China and feel torn between two countries and two families. LIZ CULKIN: They're coming back to people that they basically don't know. FERTIG: Culkin says these students rarely speak English. Sometimes they cry more than usual or don't participate. CULKIN: They're always looking around to see who's there with them. And that - they always need that sense of knowing where they are and who is there to protect them. LOIS LEE: They're angry. Why did you send me away? How come my brother is here but you sent me away? FERTIG: Lois Lee is with the Chinese American Planning Council, which runs after school and day care programs. She's in charge of a site in Flushing, Queens, which has a big Chinese community. Researchers have found these satellite babies can suffer from attachment disorder and other mental health problems, though there aren't any long-term studies on how they turn out. Lee says more free day care could prevent families from sending children abroad. But in the meantime, she's trying to help by getting the kids to talk. LEE: Out of all the people in this room right now, how many were born in the United States and went back to China or to another country. . . FERTIG: Over the summer, Lee met with students going into fourth grade at a day camp run by her program. LEE: Eleven, 12, 13, 14, 15 - thank you very much. Now the children who had their hands raised, you know that is what we call the satellite babies. FERTIG: Everyone's heard this term before. And these 8 and 9-year-olds are able to talk pretty candidly UNIDENTIFIED GIRL: I was, like, on a airport. My mom was, like, pulling my hand. I was like, (imitating sobbing) Grandpa, Grandma - why are you leave me now? And then my grandmother started crying. UNIDENTIFIED BOY #1: I felt angry. LEE: OK. What about you? UNIDENTIFIED BOY #2: I felt frustrated 'cause. . . LEE: Frustrated? UNIDENTIFIED BOY #2: Because I had been, like, with my grandma and grandpa, like, for three years. And I didn't even know that parents exist. FERTIG: We're not using any of the children's names because the families want to maintain their privacy. As the kids talk with Lee, she reminds them how far they've come. She recalls a boy they know who refused to go to class when he arrived in kindergarten. LEE: Every morning, I would see him. I would take his hand, and I would walk him to class. Maybe I was, like, the substitute mama or something, you know. (LAUGHTER) FERTIG: This helps. Chinese community groups have been holding parenting workshops, too. Schools are also very involved. VIVIEN: Daddy is running. FERTIG: At P. S. 176 in Brooklyn, Vivien is flipping through picture books in her bilingual Chinese kindergarten class. It's a few weeks after the start of school, and her teacher, Brenda Tang, says she's doing really well. She plans to encourage her mother to keep building on their relationship. That way, time apart doesn't have to be a permanent setback. For NPR News, I'm Beth Fertig in New York.", "section": "Education", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

The presidential election was supposed to be held next month, but the country's election commission says that a lack of funds and logistical obstacles will prevent a new poll from being held before December of 2018. And that means President Joseph Kabila would remain in power for more than two terms, and that would violate the country's constitution. There have been protests and the opposition has been met with threats, violence and arrest from authorities. Mvemba Phezo Dizolele, a lecturer from Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, joins us in our studios. Mr. Dizolele, thanks very much for being with us. MVEMBA PHEZO DIZOLELE: Thank you, Scott. SIMON: The head of the U. N. mission in the DRC told the U. N. Security Council this week that the country is entering what he called a period of extreme risk to its stability. Why is this moment so critical? PHEZO DIZOLELE: I think it's critical because, you know, we have had a lot of protests in the streets, especially in Kinshasa, the capital, which actually led to a lot of deaths. If you ask the government they will say that about 17 people have been killed, including police officers. And one of them was actually set ablaze. But if you ask civil society groups they will say that number is much bigger. These people are simply fighting for the respect of the constitution. President Kabila has been in power for 15 years. He came to power after his father was assassinated. He served five years and then after that a new constitution was put in place via a referendum. He was elected. But the Constitution only allows him two terms, five years each. And now he's trying to wiggle his way to stay for longer. SIMON: And is he using government to try and stay in control of the government? PHEZO DIZOLELE: Absolutely - he's using the military. He's using security forces, intelligence services. So now I think he's just trying to slide through, what the Congolese call glismo (ph), kind of slippage. By that I mean, the government has not funded the electoral commission. And if the election commission doesn't have money. . . SIMON: Well, that makes it hard to hold an election. PHEZO DIZOLELE: Correct. SIMON: And that's the idea? PHEZO DIZOLELE: That's exactly the idea and that's where we are today. So you kind of keep the country in limbo. And you say, as long as there's no election then I get to be president. SIMON: Have there been any calls for President Kabila to be investigated, forced to step down, impeached, put on trial for violating the constitution? PHEZO DIZOLELE: There's some quarters that call for that. For the most part though, at this time, the Congolese simply want him to respect the Constitution. If he were to respect the Constitution and step down, this would be the greatest part of his legacy. It will be the first time that a president in Congo has transferred power to his successor in a peaceful manner. SIMON: What form is the opposition taking at this particular point, and is there is any concern that if they're frustrated peacefully they might resort to other means? PHEZO DIZOLELE: So at this moment we have a semblance of a dialogue going on between some opposition parties and the president. But in the process, the government has actually restricted political space, which means people are being arrested. People are disappearing. People are being killed. And that's gives the opposition very little choice but to take to the streets. We can expect to see more violence if the government does not make arrangements to have an inclusive dialogue. So we are in for a long haul. SIMON: Mvemba Phezo Dizolele of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. Thanks so much for being with us. PHEZO DIZOLELE: Thank you, Scott.

When ISIS fighters seized control of Mosul more than two years ago, many inhabitants fled the city and surrounding villages. But many remained and fell under the harsh rule of the Islamic State. It was in Mosul that the leader of the Islamic State officially declared a caliphate. The offensive to retake the city is expected to last weeks, even months, and will involve thousands of Iraqi troops backed by American advisers and air support. For more, we reached Alice Fordham in Iraq. Good morning. ALICE FORDHAM, BYLINE: Good morning, Renee. MONTAGNE: And let's start with the basics of what exactly is happening. FORDHAM: OK. Well, Iraqi security forces are approaching Mosul from the south and from the northeast. It's important to note, they're not all that close to the city itself right now. They're 20 or 30 miles away in some places. And what they're going to have to do is fight their way through territory, which is mostly villages - some abandoned, some not abandoned - all currently held by ISIS. Now, the various forces are reporting progress. But it doesn't seem very rapid. There's a lot of different forces involved in this operation. In the place close to where I am, it's Iraqi-Kurdish forces. And soldiers who are on the front line there say they have been facing resistance from ISIS in these little villages. It's a similar story on the southern front, which is mainly the Iraqi army. There's been an advance of a few miles along the road to Mosul. But there is fighting reported there as well. MONTAGNE: And the reason Mosul has been so much talked about is it is a key city to wrest away from ISIS, there in Iraq. FORDHAM: Absolutely, yes. I was here a bit more than two years ago when it fell to ISIS abruptly in really kind of a lightning assault. At the time, there was about 2 million people living in the city. There might be a million people still there. It's their largest piece of territory, their most significant city. And it's their last urban holdout in Iraq. So it's tremendously important, both strategically and symbolically, to take back Mosul from ISIS. Also, just looking forward a little bit, if the taking of Mosul goes well - which is to say that the security forces are able to do the operation effectively in a way that guarantees the safety of the people inside Mosul, and maybe even people can return to their homes, looking well forward - that is significant for Iraq as well as for the fight against ISIS because it will do a lot to restore relations between people in Iraq and their security forces in government, which, especially in Mosul, have not been good for a long time. MONTAGNE: Although ISIS forces, it's been reported these last few days, have been really preparing for this long-awaited offensive on Mosul. So when security forces - Iraqi security forces - do get there, what do they expect? FORDHAM: Well, security officials are telling us that there are still thousands of ISIS fighters inside the city. The estimates that we have been given vary from 3,000 to 8,000. Residents of the city who are still there describe concrete defenses that have been erected - trenches and tunnels. Urban fighting is difficult. And although there have been reports of some ISIS leaders fleeing - people who left the city very recently told us that they believe that a lot of the ISIS leadership has run away into Syria - in other cities, we have seen them hang on with quite small numbers. They are famously prepared to fight to the death. We see suicide attackers, snipers. And they've had lots and lots of time to lay improvised explosive devices, booby traps. And what people here are terrified of is what's going to happen to the civilians inside the city, hundreds of thousands, maybe a million, maybe even more. They have been urged to stay in their houses in leaflets that have been dropped from the sky by the Iraqi security forces. But we hear from inside that a lot of people are secretly making plans to run away. And if they do that, there might be no safe route out. And aid agencies could be overwhelmed with hundreds of thousands of displaced people that they don't really have the capacity to help. MONTAGNE: NPR's Alice Fordham, speaking to us from Iraq.

The report alleges that Arab Sunni men and boys fleeing ISIS-held areas have been victims of torture, mass abductions and killings at the hand of predominantly Shia militias and possibly government forces. Joining us now via Skype to talk about this is Diana Eltahawy. She is the Iraq researcher for Amnesty International and the lead author of the report. Welcome to the program. DIANA ELTAHAWY: Thank you. SIEGEL: And your report details a number of specific incidents of what you allege are war crimes. What would you say are the most important findings? ELTAHAWY: Amnesty International's findings really show a consistent pattern of abuse committed by predominantly Shia militias but also by members of the government forces. I can give you one example from the recent operations to retake Fallujah and surrounding areas. SIEGEL: Fallujah, a city that had been taken by ISIS and then was retaken by the Iraqi government. . . ELTAHAWY: Yes, yes. The prime minister, just like now in the operations for Mosul, has called for the protection of civilians. What happened in reality was very different. We spoke to a number of survivors from an area just north of Fallujah who told us that they were intercepted by a large force of men in different uniforms. And then the men were separated from the women and marched off to be shot dead. And this is 14 men and four boys. And this is just one incident. SIEGEL: Does the government regard, say, Sunni Arab men who remain in cities that have been taken by ISIS rather than fleeing them - do they regard them with suspicion as collaborators as opposed to captives of the Islamic State? ELTAHAWY: Amnesty International spoke to many civilians, and they tell us that once they come out, they frequently get questioned by security forces as to why they have remained under ISIS control for such a long time. SIEGEL: Typically why have they remained? ELTAHAWY: There are a variety of reasons. Paramount among them is that escape routes were not so easy and so safe. And we have documented cases where the Islamic State has executed people who tried to flee. SIEGEL: I guess, though, if there are a million people still in Mosul - and I believe there at one time were 2 million - I mean some of them must support the Islamic State, no? ELTAHAWY: Certainly Amnesty International acknowledges that the Iraqi and the Kurdish authorities have every right to protect the life and physical security of all civilians in their territory. If there are suspicions against anyone for having committed crimes, these people should be brought to trials but to fair trials. What we see today is that people are being rounded up arbitrarily and kept in detention sometime for months, if not years, without even seeing a judge. SIEGEL: Has the Iraqi government responded to the Amnesty International report? ELTAHAWY: Well, even before the report, Amnesty International has sent a very detailed memorandum addressed to the prime minister. We didn't receive a reply to this memorandum, but at previous meetings, the prime minister acknowledge that there have been abuses and again saying that there have been efforts to investigate. The main concern is that whenever officials acknowledge that abuses have been committed, they insist that they're individual acts. What needs to happen is an acknowledgment of the scale and gravity of violations and people actually being punished and being removed from duty when they commit such atrocities.

Mosul has been under the control of that terrorist group for more than two years, and it is home to hundreds of thousands of civilians, as many as a million, trapped between the opposing sides in this battle. To better understand the challenges of retaking Mosul, we're joined by retired Colonel Peter Mansoor on Skype. He served twice in Iraq, including during the surge. Good morning. PETER MANSOOR: Good morning, Renee. MONTAGNE: Now, you know Mosul. What will it take to drive out ISIS? MANSOOR: Well, there's two challenges. There's military challenges, and then there is the more critical political challenges, but first to the military challenges. As you mentioned, ISIS has had two years to dig in. They've wired houses to explode. They've planted thousands, maybe tens of thousands, of roadside bombs in the streets. They have a very dedicated and hardcore cadre of fighters, upwards of 5,000, ready to fight to the death for Mosul. And they have pools of oil that they've set on fire to darken the skies to try to make it harder for aircraft to target them. So these are all military challenges that we're all pretty trained and our forces and the Iraqi forces are pretty good at combating. The more important challenges will be the political challenges that follow the end of the battle of Mosul, which is probably weeks and maybe months away. MONTAGNE: There have been reports in the news of small signs of resistance by local Mosul men against ISIS itself. I'm hearing about the offensive reports that young men in Mosul are calling on each other to rise up against the Islamic State when this battle begins. Do you think if that - something like that occurs that would have any effect on ultimately on how the battle goes? Could they be of help if this is - this happens? MANSOOR: Obviously, the locals rising up against ISIS is something that we would applaud. I don't think it would have a lot of impact on the outcome of the battle, which is preordained anyway. What it would have an impact on is the aftermath because if the locals are part of the solution to fighting ISIS rather than part of the problem in supporting them, that's obviously a very, very good thing. And after living under ISIS' grip for two years, you can imagine that many locals are probably fed up with its administration. So I think that in small ways this is probably happening, but I would be surprised if it's a large movement. MONTAGNE: Well, the Red Cross just this morning says it's preparing for enormous civilian casualties, including possibly from chemical attacks, and civilian populations have been talked about as being used as human shields. Is that your expectation? MANSOOR: It's unlikely that ISIS is going to allow the population to flee. There is one corridor that's been left open to allow the population to move out of the city to the west. But ISIS probably wants a humanitarian catastrophe in Mosul. It's part of their narrative that this is the West versus Islam and see what happens when they support forces that attack us. So the population is likely to suffer a great deal in the upcoming fighting unfortunately. MONTAGNE: Well, just briefly, when you spoke about the political implications - I mean, this is far away, but must be of great concern now - after the battle. MANSOOR: Well, you have Iraqi army forces, Kurdish peshmerga. You have Turkish forces and Shiite militias all vying for control of the same piece of terrain in the aftermath of the fighting. A political solution to enable a stable government to emerge from the end of the fighting has got to be worked out. And this is probably job number one for our diplomats over there in Baghdad. MONTAGNE: Well, thank you so much for joining us. MANSOOR: My pleasure. MONTAGNE: Colonel Peter Mansoor, now retired, served in Iraq twice, including during the period of the surge in 2007 and '08. RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST:   The offensive to take back Iraq's second-largest city from the Islamic State is underway. Mosul has been under the control of that terrorist group for more than two years, and it is home to hundreds of thousands of civilians, as many as a million, trapped between the opposing sides in this battle. To better understand the challenges of retaking Mosul, we're joined by retired Colonel Peter Mansoor on Skype. He served twice in Iraq, including during the surge. Good morning. PETER MANSOOR: Good morning, Renee. MONTAGNE: Now, you know Mosul. What will it take to drive out ISIS? MANSOOR: Well, there's two challenges. There's military challenges, and then there is the more critical political challenges, but first to the military challenges. As you mentioned, ISIS has had two years to dig in. They've wired houses to explode. They've planted thousands, maybe tens of thousands, of roadside bombs in the streets. They have a very dedicated and hardcore cadre of fighters, upwards of 5,000, ready to fight to the death for Mosul. And they have pools of oil that they've set on fire to darken the skies to try to make it harder for aircraft to target them. So these are all military challenges that we're all pretty trained and our forces and the Iraqi forces are pretty good at combating. The more important challenges will be the political challenges that follow the end of the battle of Mosul, which is probably weeks and maybe months away. MONTAGNE: There have been reports in the news of small signs of resistance by local Mosul men against ISIS itself. I'm hearing about the offensive reports that young men in Mosul are calling on each other to rise up against the Islamic State when this battle begins. Do you think if that - something like that occurs that would have any effect on ultimately on how the battle goes? Could they be of help if this is - this happens? MANSOOR: Obviously, the locals rising up against ISIS is something that we would applaud. I don't think it would have a lot of impact on the outcome of the battle, which is preordained anyway. What it would have an impact on is the aftermath because if the locals are part of the solution to fighting ISIS rather than part of the problem in supporting them, that's obviously a very, very good thing. And after living under ISIS' grip for two years, you can imagine that many locals are probably fed up with its administration. So I think that in small ways this is probably happening, but I would be surprised if it's a large movement. MONTAGNE: Well, the Red Cross just this morning says it's preparing for enormous civilian casualties, including possibly from chemical attacks, and civilian populations have been talked about as being used as human shields.

This leaves civilians with a choice - whether to stay, whether to flee and, if they flee, where to go. Filippo Grandi, the United Nations high commissioner for refugees, is in northern Iraq and making preparations. He told us via Skype he's been visiting refugee camps outside Mosul. How many beds do you have available, if that's the way to think about it for people coming out of the city. FILIPPO GRANDI: No, it's more how much shelter we have available. You know, unfortunately, we're not talking about beds here. We're talking about tents and other shelter options. We estimate that, between everybody - the government, the relief organizations, the UN - you know, we can provide some form of rudimentary shelter to up to 400,000 people. The problem is sites have been identified, except that there are too few. And we've insisted that they be placed in locations that are out of the way of the fighting. So far, so good. But, you know, many will stay with relatives, so maybe we'll have to give a little help to the families. Others will stay in ruined buildings. You need to give them emergency kits to fix places that are not suitable for living. So we will have to adapt accordingly. And I think that we will need all these options, not just one. INSKEEP: Do you think it is safer for people in Mosul - civilians in Mosul to leave or to stay in their homes and get in the basement, if they can? GRANDI: I really don't know, but I know one thing based on my long experience in this area - they know better. So what I told the government is that - let them decide. Then we need to help them, but let them decide. What I got back from the authorities was positive. INSKEEP: What do you mean you heard something positive back? What did they say? GRANDI: The government told us that they are fully aware that protection of civilians should be part of their strategy and is part of the strategy, which was not the case in previous offensives in this country, that there should be no space for retribution. We've seen this in previous offensives. This has made people to flee in greater numbers. And it has discouraged them from coming back. My concern is make sure that this goes down to the ground level that will respect the people. You know, it's always difficult in a war, especially in fragile states, to go down the chain of command and have good decisions implemented in a good way. INSKEEP: Granting that you can't predict the future, as you plan, do you assume that at the end of this campaign there will be an inhabitable city? GRANDI: I don't know. We have little idea of the damage that has been inflicted on Mosul for the past couple of years. But one thing is sure - we know that there will have to be massive infrastructure interventions, private housing and public infrastructure. Education, health system, energy - all that will have to be restored and will require huge resources. And I think the most difficult part will be to restore the social fabric of the city. That's why the way the war will be conducted will determine the viability of this reconstruction of the social fabric. If it is conducted in a humane manner that does not include retribution, targeting of groups, the civilian population, then we have a chance to restore the very diverse city that Mosul was in the past. If not, I foresee a long period of instability in and around the city. INSKEEP: Filippo Grandi of the United Nations, thanks very much. GRANDI: Thank you. Bye-bye.

Iraqi generals say it may take months to clear that large city of ISIS. And a man who knows Mosul says the military operation that began this week is just the start. General David Petraeus is focused on what happens after Iraqi forces move in. Petraeus is the retired U. S. Army general who once commanded all U. S. forces in Iraq. And back in 2003, he led the 101st Airborne Division as it entered the city of Mosul. What's it like? DAVID PETRAEUS: It's the most complex human terrain in all of Iraq. Mosul is a city that used to be of nearly 2 million people. It's probably about a million civilians or more in there still. It has a Sunni Arab majority, but there are also Shia Arabs there. There are Turkmen Shia as well as Sunni. There are Kurds, and they're in three different parties. There are Yazidis. There are Christians. There are Shabak. There are innumerable tribes and other elements of society. And so, again, the order of magnitude of the complexity and the sheer scale is beyond anything that the Iraqi security forces have had to contend with so far. INSKEEP: What are the implications of that complexity? Does that mean, as you're going into the city, if you make friends with someone, you don't know if you might be making an enemy at the same time? PETRAEUS: I think the implication is really more about post-Islamic-State governance. That's the real issue here. There's no question that the Iraqi security forces - with all of the enablers, the advice, the assistance being provided by the U. S. and the coalition against the Islamic State, no question that they are going to defeat the Islamic State in Mosul. The question really comes down to post-Islamic-State governance. The Iraqi government is obviously going to influence this, the Kurdish regional government. There's a Turkish element lingering on the outskirts of the city. And as I said, there are all of these different elements within it, and a number of those have grievances. There will be some that want to settle scores. And certainly all of them are going to be competing for power and resources and influence. INSKEEP: Past visits to Mosul - I have a memory of some very tightly packed neighborhoods of a rather extensive metropolitan area. It seems that if you're going house to house and trying to clear the area that even a few people resisting could cause you a lot of trouble for a long time. PETRAEUS: That's exactly right, and that's the challenge of urban fighting. And, of course, this is urban fighting where the enemy has had two years to occupy, to prepare tunnels, to dig in, to have overhead cover, to have sniper holes, to have improvised explosive devices, to have houses that are rigged to blow. They've even reportedly got a trench that's filled with oil that they've torched to create smoke and obscure some of the optics on our unmanned aerial vehicles and so forth. So again, there will be tough battles in this without question. But the outcome, I think, is absolutely certain. In fact, I think, in truth, the Islamic State, they know that they are going to be defeated. And, in fact, a number of them have tried to desert already and is typical that they have been shot by the Islamic State. They've shot and killed civilians who they believed were plotting against them. There has been contact with civilians in the city. Reportedly they're going to rise up at the first shot once it's inside the city. So again, they face a very, very difficult task that, ultimately, is going to end in their defeat. INSKEEP: Given the broad strategic concerns that you've laid out, does it matter particularly if Islamic State fighters are killed in the fighting or if some of them get away to fight another day? PETRAEUS: Well, I think, look, any military guy always will tell you that you don't want to let fighters get away to fight another day, that we don't want them to retreat to Raqqa or perhaps even retreat all the way to their home country, if they're from outside of Iraq and Syria. We don't want to see our European allies have to face a bunch of returning extremists from the battlefields in Iraq and Syria. So again, always in the interest of either detaining or killing them, if they put up resistance. INSKEEP: But is it a big deal if they get away? PETRAEUS: It is. It depends on the number that get away, depends on the skills that escape. You know, if some of these are the great explosives device makers, if they are the inspirational leaders, if they are technical experts in some aspect of the Islamic State army's activities. Keep in mind, by the way, this is - we call it a terrorist group, and it is. This is an Islamic extremist organization that carries out horrific terrorist activities. But in this manifestation, it's an army. And there's no army that is going to stand up against the combined capabilities of a force that has been reconstituted, retrained and equipped and remanned and enabled now by the constellation of assets that the United States and the coalition members can put over top of it with unmanned aerial vehicles, lots of precision-strike assets, and then the intelligence fusion that is helping them as well. As we provide advice, as we provide assistance, as we provide enabling, having done already the train-and-equip and continuing that, and even already planning now to take some of them back off the line after this is complete to spool them up, if you will, to focus on what will be the remnants. There will be guerrillas. There will be insurgents. And there are certainly still terrorist cells in cities like Baghdad and around it. INSKEEP: So what does winning look like, then? PETRAEUS: Winning looks like a city that is cleared of the Islamic State that ultimately has a provincial government that is based in Mosul. Although I hasten to add, we can put a stake through the heart of the organization, certainly the army, ultimately, perhaps, all the guerrilla cells and terrorist cells that will remain and maybe even their leader, Baghdadi - you know, you can't run an army and run a caliphate without ending up on the X, as we say - but we can't put a stake through the heart of the ideas and the ideology - these horrible ideas that have inspired individuals to carry out extremist actions, terrorist acts. And that's what we're going to have to contend with. And that's why I have said that this is very likely a generational struggle, not just the fight of a few years or a decade. And it has already gone on obviously some 15 years at this moment anyway. INSKEEP: General Petraeus, thanks very much. PETRAEUS: Great to be with you again, Steve. INSKEEP: Retired U. S.

Iraqi forces are pressing against the Islamic State there. Reporter Fazel Hawramy has been on the frontlines with various Iraqi forces. And he joined us earlier via Skype. He was just watching Kurdish forces seize villages outside the city proper. FAZEL HAWRAMY: If the last four days have been any indication for how ISIS is going to fight in Mosul, it appears that they're not going to, you know, last long. And the Peshmerga and the Iraqi security forces may be able to take Mosul even quicker than most analysts and most generals expect. INSKEEP: Is there fear that the resistance by ISIS will become stronger as Iraqi forces move into the city of Mosul itself, where you would have urban combat and many, many obstacles? HAWRAMY: I mean, that's a possibility. But in the surrounding of Mosul, there hasn't been much resistance. The Iraqis and the Kurds have managed to take village after village. And - I mean, this morning, I was really surprised because when they started the operation, literally within like an hour, they took the first village without any resistance. Then the second village, there was a bit of resistance there. But it wasn't that much. So it seems ISIS has pulled out its militants towards Mosul. So one explanation could be that they want to resist in Mosul, and they want to fight really hard the Iraqi army and the Peshmerga forces. Or they're basically - they just know that they're going to be defeated, and they're pulling out of these areas north and east of Mosul. INSKEEP: As the Iraqi forces have moved forward, have you seen any civilians in these village areas or fleeing the area? HAWRAMY: Well, yesterday, I went to the south of Mosul, to a village called Ibran Kali (ph). And there, there was the Iraqi army in the village. ISIS fled about three days earlier. And we saw about 100 civilians in the village. I spoke to several of them, and they were complaining about lack of food, lack of medicine. But they were happy that the Iraqi army treated them with respect, and they treated them well. And then you could see in the village, the remnants of ISIS and what they've done - the tunnels, all these punishments for various so-called, like, crimes such as homosexual relations, such as adultery, such as drinking alcohol. INSKEEP: What do you mean that you could see the punishments? What did you see? HAWRAMY: Well, basically, we went into a school and they put up a flyer on the wall. And it says the Islamic State. And it says, like - it broke down various offenses, such as adultery, drinking alcohol, homosexual relations. And underneath, it said, like, what punishment should be meted out to this or that offense - mainly lashing people, whipping people and, specifically for homosexual relations, it was death. INSKEEP: And did you see very many civilians in these areas? HAWRAMY: There were around hundred civilians, mainly young men, children. And I sat down with some of them. We spoke about life there before ISIS and after ISIS. And they complained about how brutal this organization was. And they seem to be happy that the Iraqi army has taken back the village. But I think there is a concern by some of the residents in this area that if there is no reinforcement by the Iraqi army and the ISIS counterattacks, which they did about two days ago and they took back two villages, the lives of these civilians may be put at risk.

BEARDSLEY: Though nothing has been confirmed, Chretien and other residents fear the government is going to place thousands of refugees in an abandoned industrial site on the outskirts of town. So this month, they formed an association called Save Louveciennes. Other surrounding towns created similar associations. CHRETIEN: We talk a lot together. We don't want to be the new Calais, you understand? Because Calais, we've seen that there was no dignity for the people and there were lots of problem of security.

They're some of the young women who were kidnapped at their school by Boko Haram two and a half years ago. Boko Haram still holds almost 200 students, but the ones who've been released or who've escaped are still dealing with the trauma of being kidnapped and the stigma of going back home. We talked about this with Kim Toogood from the NGO International Alert. She's worked with other cases of girls and women who've been abducted by Boko Haram. And she told us one reason these girls face stigma is because people associate them with the violence of Boko Haram. KIMAIRIS TOOGOOD: If you think about it, many of these community members have also experienced extreme violence at the hands of Boko Haram. And in many cases that is where the stigma and discrimination against women and girls and children born of sexual violence is coming from. MCEVERS: I mean, does this happen often? And is it - it sounds like it's just because people can still be scared, right? TOOGOOD: Right, exactly. I mean, it's a natural reaction that you fled from extreme violence, in many cases witnessed your own loved ones being murdered in front of your very eyes. And you know that this individual, this woman or girl or child, has been associated with this arms group which has committed so much violence against you. And you're not quite sure if they have accepted the ideology. You're not sure if they've been co-opted, if they're really supportive of the ideology. And so once they come home and they're standing next to you in the line for the food, there's a sense of fear that's inside you, whether you know that that person was taken without their choice or they went willingly, there's just a natural fear that kind of comes with the territory of living side by side with people you're not quite sure you can trust anymore. MCEVERS: And what about women who return with babies, you know, that were conceived with men in the camp? TOOGOOD: Yeah, it's hard I think for women and girls that return with children born of sexual violence with Boko Haram. They face an additional stigma. In our work, we have realized that many of these women and girls have found amazing capacity to love these children. The challenge is that other community members have the kind of understanding that if a child shares a bloodline with an insurgent, they will grow up to be an insurgent. Actually, you know, violent extremism in their minds is generational, and so that child is actually the next generation of violence that will be committed against them. MCEVERS: Should Nigeria be doing more to help these women and girls reintegrate into society? TOOGOOD: I think the Nigerian government or authorities are dwarfed by the need that's actually on the ground. And so at this time, I would say yes, they have a lot of desire to be helping. They do do as much as is within their capable hands to be able to do. But you're talking about millions of people in displacement. You're talking about livelihoods and entire cycles of agriculture that have been wiped away over years of insurgency. There are just not enough resources (unintelligible) readily available to be able to address so many needs at a very concrete basic human needs level. And then you add this element of psychosocial support and reintegration, and in many cases people do actually take these two pieces as two separate things, like rebuild schools now and then eventually everyone will go in the schoolhouse together. But we know that if people don't trust each other, they're not going to go in that school together. So this support really does need to be infused in all of the reconstruction plans that are being done, whether it's by the Nigerian government or by international organization.

Well, that's what environmental activist Emily Penn decided to find out. EMILY PENN: I grew up eating food mostly from the back garden. My parents are hugely keen gardeners. RAZ: You were not eating processed food? PENN: I wasn't eating processed food. I was the one who showed up at my friend's birthday party with, like, freshly-pulled beetroot with its sprouts all attached to give to my friends, when everyone else showed up with a box of chocolates. RAZ: So you're thinking, like, my body is not exactly loaded with toxic chemicals? PENN: Exactly. RAZ: But recently, Emily decided to have her blood tested for 35 toxic chemicals that are banned by the United Nations. PENN: And of those 35 chemicals that we tested for, we found 29 of them inside my body. RAZ: And that included traces of pesticides and flame retardants. PENN: I should point out here that the levels of chemicals I have inside me, they're not alarmingly high that I need to be immediately concerned about my health.

And Emily is focused on just one of those ways - through plastics. So think about how much plastic you use every day - a plastic fork, a phone, little baggies for sandwiches. . . PENN: The smell of a new shower curtain. RAZ: Oh, I love that smell. PENN: Yeah (laughter). That's. . . RAZ: That's not good? PENN: No, that's not good. RAZ: One problem with plastic - it's made to last a very, very long time. PENN: And then we go and design products like plastic bags and plastic water bottles that are designed to be used just once out of that material that's designed to last forever. RAZ: And there's really not a lot of great options for how to deal with all that plastic. Emily explained why on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TEDx TALK)PENN: Only about 10 percent of the plastic that we use actually gets recycled. And that number's so low because plastic is really a term that we give to hundreds of different materials. They all have different properties. And to give them those properties, they need different chemical structures. But when you recycle something, the first thing you have to do is separate out all those different types of plastic. You need to clean them. And it's a very lengthy and expensive process. And it's much, much cheaper to take virgin plastic and make new products from scratch. And so instead, we see a lot of this plastic going to landfill. And also, 8 million tons of it annually washing down streams, down rivers and waterways. And eventually everything runs downhill to the ocean. RAZ: A couple of years ago, Emily went on a boat trip organized by environmental activists to see the problem firsthand. PENN: We would be in a part of the ocean a thousand miles from the nearest human being, you know, in the middle of the Pacific. And we'd - you'd see everything. You'd see plastic bags, plastic fragments, a washing basket. . . RAZ: In the middle of the ocean? PENN: . . . A TV - in the middle of the ocean. You'd jump in for a swim and you'd find a toothbrush. You know, it just totally boggled my mind about how we have managed to just disperse our waste literally across the whole of our planet. RAZ: But it wasn't until they put a fine net into the ocean, when they realized there is a much bigger problem. (SOUNDBITE OF TEDx TALK)PENN: The bigger problem was actually the smaller pieces. Because when we bring that net on deck, turn that sock inside out, this is what we find. We find thousands of tiny fragments of plastic smaller than your little fingernail, what we call micro plastics. And most of the plastic in our ocean is actually that big. When we get these samples on board, we see the same thing all the way from the tropics up to the Arctic. And it's almost like there's this fine mist of plastic pieces that just vary in concentration across our whole ocean. And so when we get those samples back onboard, the next thing we have to do is analyze them and work out what's plastic and what's plankton. And it made me wonder how the fish would cope, working out what was their food and what wasn't. And then we start finding things like fish with actually fragments of plastic inside its stomach. RAZ: So basically, these toxins that are going into the fish are just, like, climbing up the food chain? PENN: Yes, exactly. So the fact that when that plastic - so much of it does end up in our ocean. We are now finding a lot of - definitely the bigger marine mammals that you would have seen in the media, whales being washed up, turtles being found with stomachs full of plastic. It is rather scary that we know that this plastic, which has a lot of toxic chemicals, that actually getting into the food chain, that of course we are at the top of. RAZ: So I know that you take groups out to show them the effects of plastic in our environment. PENN: Yeah. RAZ: You also - you do the same blood tests for people in those groups. And so are you finding that everyone you test is just full of toxins? PENN: So before you get too depressed, we did have some interesting results when we looked at DDE - the derivative of DDT - inside our bodies. And of the whole group that we were sampling, we found that one of our members of the group had very, very high levels of DDE, way above the national average. And the rest of us, way below the national average. And she was actually 67 years old, and the only one of us who was alive prior to 1972, prior to that ban of DDT. What we can kind of draw from that small set of results is that those of us who have just been living post the ban have actually got very little of that chemical inside us. So when we do decide to make a change and we enforce it really as a global community, then we can see positive results in our own bodies. RAZ: Emily Penn is an environmental activist. You can see her full talk at ted. npr. org. GUY RAZ, HOST:  So how much of these toxins are actually inside our bodies? Well, that's what environmental activist Emily Penn decided to find out. EMILY PENN: I grew up eating food mostly from the back garden. My parents are hugely keen gardeners. RAZ: You were not eating processed food? PENN: I wasn't eating processed food. I was the one who showed up at my friend's birthday party with, like, freshly-pulled beetroot with its sprouts all attached to give to my friends, when everyone else showed up with a box of chocolates. RAZ: So you're thinking, like, my body is not exactly loaded with toxic chemicals? PENN: Exactly. RAZ: But recently, Emily decided to have her blood tested for 35 toxic chemicals that are banned by the United Nations. PENN: And of those 35 chemicals that we tested for, we found 29 of them inside my body. RAZ: And that included traces of pesticides and flame retardants. PENN: I should point out here that the levels of chemicals I have inside me, they're not alarmingly high that I need to be immediately concerned about my health. PENN: For me, it's more of a scary indication of the direction that we're heading. RAZ: As we just heard from Tyrone Hayes, there are tons of ways these chemicals get into our bodies.

It's the second biggest city in Iraq, and Iraqi forces are trying to take the city back from ISIS, which has held it for the last two years. To talk more about what's going on, we're joined now by NPR's Alice Fordham, who's in Erbil, Iraq. Hi, Alice. ALICE FORDHAM, BYLINE: Hello. MARTIN: And Tom Bowman, Pentagon correspondent, is here with me in Washington, D. C. Hi, Tom. TOM BOWMAN, BYLINE: Good to be with you. MARTIN: So thanks to you both for speaking with us. Alice, I'm going to start with you. You're in northern Iraq, not in Mosul, but you're not far away. Can you give us a sense of what's happening? FORDHAM: Well, since Monday, there has been an array of Iraqi security forces and some Western advisers approaching Mosul from two main directions. They're still a ways out of the city of Mosul. They're fighting their way through rural areas, villages, mountains. In the south, it's mainly the Iraqi army. They are fighting their way through populated villages, which is messy. Sometimes there are people joining with the army to fight against ISIS. Sometimes there is house-to-house fighting against ISIS. Then closer to where I am right now in the north, it's been mainly the Kurdish forces, Iraqi forces called Peshmerga. They're moving through a largely depopulated area, but they say they have been surprised by the number of traps set for them by ISIS - car bombs, truck bombs, mines plus mortar attacks and snipers. In addition, in the last couple of days a chemical plant, part of a chemical plant, has been set alight, which is filling some of the air to the south of Mosul with clouds of toxic smoke. MARTIN: Wow. So, Tom, what are you hearing from the Pentagon about the battle plan? BOWMAN: They say it is on schedule, but they're not being specific about how long it's going to take before they can actually retake Mosul. What we've seen so far is a lot of delaying tactics from ISIS. It's - they're setting off huge numbers of car and truck bombs. They're lighting pits on fire with oil in them to obscure their movements so aircraft can't see them. But they are optimistic. Defense Secretary Ash Carter told reporters traveling with him today in Turkey that listen, things seem to be going well, there's momentum, but this is very, very complex. And also, as they get closer to Mosul, that's when it's going to get really complex. It's an urban fight. You have hundreds of thousands of civilians, so you have to kind of sort them out, give humanitarian aid. This is going to be going on for a very long time. MARTIN: You know, it is sometimes the case that the way things are conveyed in Washington are different from the way they seem on the ground, closer to the fighting. So, Tom, I'm going to ask you - how is this whole situation being conveyed to you? And then I'm going to ask Alice to see whether that squares with what she's seeing. BOWMAN: Well, I've been covering the military for about 20 years now and through the various wars. And they're always more optimistic in Washington. And this is no different. But clearly, privately, they're very worried about all sorts of things. The Peshmerga and the Iraqis are complaining about not enough air strikes. They're worried about possibly chemical weapons being used by ISIS fighters, either chlorine or some sort of a mustard-type agent. That's why they've distributed 24,000 gas masks to Iraqi and Kurdish forces. FORDHAM: I actually think, Tom, I'm going to take the liberty of interrupting you there. I think that the concern on the chemical weapon is a bit more immediate than that. Yes, there are reports that ISIS had bomb-making factories in Mosul for some time. They've held the city for more than two years. But what's happened is that al-Mishraq plant, it's called, part of that has been set alight by ISIS as a kind of giant chemical weapon that is spreading over a large area, including over where American, Western advisers are based, as well as Iraqi forces. So the situation is in some ways quite urgent in terms of the chemical concerns. MARTIN: Why now? Why is this battle taking place now? BOWMAN: Well, we've been told it was going to start really for the past year and a half, but there were always some sort of delays. The Iraqi forces needed a lot more training. They had to work out differences between Kurdish forces and the Iraqi government forces, the various grievances the Kurds have with the Iraqi government. And, I think, also the White House has been pushing this to get underway before the president leaves office. They want to have a lot of momentum, you know, taking down ISIS in its two major cities - Mosul in Iraq and Raqqa, the de facto headquarters next door in Syria - before the president leaves next January. MARTIN: What's the vision for what happens next, after the fighting is over? FORDHAM: Well, this is something that I am personally enormously interested in. When ISIS took over large parts of Iraq a bit more than two years ago, the line from the U. S. -led coalition against ISIS was that there had to be both a political and a military plan for getting rid of ISIS. What we're seeing now is quite an advanced and a complex military plan for kicking ISIS out of this city of Mosul. There's a million people still living there. It is, by some distance, their biggest and most prestigious holdout. But there does seem to be not so much in terms of a stabilization plan, any kind of way of guaranteeing to the people that go back to Mosul that there won't be a lot of retribution and revenge killing, that there will be rule of law, that there will be good governance - all things that were lacking in Mosul prior to 2014, which is part of the reason, perhaps, that some of the people there did support ISIS when they first came in. However, most of the people I'm talking to now - people who've left very recently, even occasionally people inside Mosul - say that Iraq has long been a violent place. And they have seen difficult times in Mosul, but they have never seen anything like life under ISIS. And they want them out at any cost. MARTIN: And Tom, where does this fit into the larger fight against ISIS? BOWMAN: Well, if ISIS is defeated in Mosul, that's a huge win for the coalition because ISIL in Mosul - Mosul is the second biggest town in Iraq. It's the biggest city they have in Iraq right now. And after that, you'll see the fight move into Syria, to the city of Raqqa, which is the de facto capital for the Islamic State. And that would be the the final battle, really, here. But one of the problems with Raqqa is you don't have enough ground forces there. You don't have enough Kurdish forces and Syrian-Arab forces, according to the Pentagon, to really press Raqqa. Right now, you're seeing a lot of American air strikes there. You have some American special operations forces assisting those ground forces. But they still have to get a lot more local forces on the ground in Syria to press Raqqa. That'll be the next big step after Mosul. MARTIN: That's NPR's Alice Fordham. She's in Erbil, Iraq. NPR's Tom Bowman was here with me in Washington, D. C. Thank you both so much for speaking with us. BOWMAN: You're welcome. FORDHAM: Thanks for having me.

President Duterte has been in China this week. He told an audience of business people there, I've realigned myself in your ideological flow. Maybe I will also go to Russia to talk to Putin and tell him that there are three of us against the world - China, Philippines and Russia. It's the only way. Thomas Pepinsky is an associate professor at Cornell University who specializes in Southeast Asia. Professor, thanks very much for being with us. THOMAS PEPINSKY: Thanks very much for having me. SIMON: What do you make of this? PEPINSKY: This is a bit of a perplexing set of statements from Duterte. If you want to be even more confused, you can check out the fact that he has since walked back some of those comments. SIMON: What are the implications for the United States to lose that partnership, if you please, with the Philippines? PEPINSKY: Well, it's unlikely that this partnership will be lost entirely. But the real implications of Duterte's statements are that they signal a sort of disconnect between him as an individual and as a leader and his foreign policy establishment in this population. It signals a kind of instability or volatility in the way that he makes decisions, in the way that he conveys what he believes Filipino national interests to be. SIMON: I'm going to just guess now - you mean people in government and perhaps the military think the partnership is important for the Philippines and he has another idea? PEPINSKY: Absolutely. It's, again, very hard to see exactly what Duterte himself believes the interests are. But the U. S. remains quite popular in the Philippines. And even members of his own cabinet appear to be a bit perplexed or baffled by some of these statements. And they very quickly hastened to walk back his own statements. SIMON: At the same time, has being an ally of the U. S. made it a little harder for the Philippines to do business with China, which, after all, is the big dog in that neighborhood? PEPINSKY: I don't really think so. My sense is that had Duterte not said anything about U. S. -Philippine relations in Beijing, he would have signed most of the deals that he signed anyway. In fact, the Obama administration has put some emphasis on encouraging the Philippines to invest with partners in the region as well, including China. So this probably wasn't even necessary. SIMON: President Duterte was elected in a landslide this year. He declared what he called a bloody war on drugs, which, in fact, sounds pretty bloody. Hundreds of people have been killed each month. The U. N. and U. S. has criticized this. But has it been popular at home? PEPINSKY: It has indeed been popular at home. And this is ultimately the source of his current sky-high popularity rating as president. SIMON: And it's been popular because? PEPINSKY: It's hard to say exactly why the Filipino population is so concerned with drugs, given that drugs and drug use is not particularly any more of a national scourge there than it would be in any other country in the region. I believe that the core source of Duterte's popularity in this action is that Filipinos believe that this is a signal of his ability to enforce a kind of order that the country has not seen in quite some time. SIMON: In your judgment, should the U. S. make some kind of response to what President Duterte has said in China or kind of let it ride? PEPINSKY: I dont think the U. S. is going to let it ride. I think that the Obama administration has so far been fairly measured in how it responds to these periodic outbursts. In the past, the United States has responded to Duterte's insulting of Obama himself by refusing to meet with him, and that actually led to a pretty quick apology. And my guess is that the response from the Obama administration will be, once again, to clarify that it tends to live up to its treaty obligations with the Philippines and it expects the Philippines to do the same. SIMON: Thomas Pepinsky, associate professor at Cornell. Thanks so much for being with us. PEPINSKY: Thank you very much. SCOTT SIMON, HOST:  President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines said his country is done with the United States. President Duterte has been in China this week. He told an audience of business people there, I've realigned myself in your ideological flow. Maybe I will also go to Russia to talk to Putin and tell him that there are three of us against the world - China, Philippines and Russia. It's the only way. Thomas Pepinsky is an associate professor at Cornell University who specializes in Southeast Asia. Professor, thanks very much for being with us. THOMAS PEPINSKY: Thanks very much for having me. SIMON: What do you make of this? PEPINSKY: This is a bit of a perplexing set of statements from Duterte. If you want to be even more confused, you can check out the fact that he has since walked back some of those comments. SIMON: What are the implications for the United States to lose that partnership, if you please, with the Philippines? PEPINSKY: Well, it's unlikely that this partnership will be lost entirely. But the real implications of Duterte's statements are that they signal a sort of disconnect between him as an individual and as a leader and his foreign policy establishment in this population. It signals a kind of instability or volatility in the way that he makes decisions, in the way that he conveys what he believes Filipino national interests to be. SIMON: I'm going to just guess now - you mean people in government and perhaps the military think the partnership is important for the Philippines and he has another idea? PEPINSKY: Absolutely. It's, again, very hard to see exactly what Duterte himself believes the interests are. But the U. S. remains quite popular in the Philippines. And even members of his own cabinet appear to be a bit perplexed or baffled by some of these statements. And they very quickly hastened to walk back his own statements. SIMON: At the same time, has being an ally of the U. S. made it a little harder for the Philippines to do business with China, which, after all, is the big dog in that neighborhood? PEPINSKY: I don't really think so. My sense is that had Duterte not said anything about U. S. -Philippine relations in Beijing, he would have signed most of the deals that he signed anyway. In fact, the Obama administration has put some emphasis on encouraging the Philippines to invest with partners in the region as well, including China. So this probably wasn't even necessary. SIMON: President Duterte was elected in a landslide this year. He declared what he called a bloody war on drugs, which, in fact, sounds pretty bloody. Hundreds of people have been killed each month. The U. N. and U. S. has criticized this. But has it been popular at home? PEPINSKY: It has indeed been popular at home. And this is ultimately the source of his current sky-high popularity rating as president. SIMON: And it's been popular because? PEPINSKY: It's hard to say exactly why the Filipino population is so concerned with drugs, given that drugs and drug use is not particularly any more of a national scourge there than it would be in any other country in the region. I believe that the core source of Duterte's popularity in this action is that Filipinos believe that this is a signal of his ability to enforce a kind of order that the country has not seen in quite some time. SIMON: In your judgment, should the U. S. make some kind of response to what President Duterte has said in China or kind of let it ride? PEPINSKY: I dont think the U. S. is going to let it ride. I think that the Obama administration has so far been fairly measured in how it responds to these periodic outbursts. In the past, the United States has responded to Duterte's insulting of Obama himself by refusing to meet with him, and that actually led to a pretty quick apology. And my guess is that the response from the Obama administration will be, once again, to clarify that it tends to live up to its treaty obligations with the Philippines and it expects the Philippines to do the same.

That's the storm that just pounded the Philippines. Meanwhile, Haiti still reels two weeks after Hurricane Matthew ravaged parts of that country. The Category 4 storm pummeled Haiti's southern shore. It uprooted trees, destroyed bridges and homes. Hundreds of people died, all of this as Haiti struggles to rebuild after the earthquake that ripped through the island six years ago. Dr. Joanna Cherry is the chief medical officer of Hospital Bernard Mevs' Project Medishare in Port-au-Prince. We reached her on Skype. Dr. Cherry, thanks for being with us. JOANNA CHERRY: Thank you for having me. SIMON: What are conditions like in the South, near as you can tell? CHERRY: So our team have done extensive reviews of the South. We can tell you that when our teams arrived, they compared the area to that of a bomb blast. There's no leaves left on any trees. There's very little foliage still standing. There's no shade in any areas. Multiple houses had their roofs taken off during the storm. In the last two weeks, there has been some work on trying to get houses covered again. Unfortunately, in the last 48 hours, we've had some pretty severe weather in the area, so some of the efforts have been somewhat reversed by flooding and by just poor conditions. SIMON: And this increases the risk of, say, tetanus and cholera? CHERRY: Absolutely. And one of our major concerns has always been waterborne disease. So part of the operations that we've been involved in has been trying to supply clean water sources to people. When the rains start again, we end up with a massive increase in the waterborne diseases in each area. So this is a real concern for us right now. SIMON: We've heard of a patient that your hospital took in, a boy who was under a tree when it fell. What can you tell us about him? CHERRY: Yes. We had a 12-year-old boy admitted to us after the storm. He'd actually been trapped under a tree for four days. He - unfortunately, his spine was broken in the initial injury. He also had a broken leg. He ended up having a wound that was in his buttock, which was right through the muscle. We got him to Port-au-Prince, and we realized pretty quickly that he also had active tetanus. I'm very sorry to say that he died yesterday. SIMON: Oh, my God. I didn't know. I'm so sorry. CHERRY: So this really shouldn't be happening in 2016, an hour and a half from Miami. These are preventable diseases from a simple vaccination. SIMON: I am so sorry. We didn't know. God bless. God bless him and you. CHERRY: Thank you. SIMON: Dr. Cherry, how do you do what needs to be done that's right in front of you and, at the same time, try and do all the work that has to be done to give Haiti a better future? CHERRY: Well, I think nobody is under any illusion that we still haven't got a long way to go here. But I think we have to give a lot of credit to the organizations that are here all the time trying to improve food security, trying to improve health care and trying to improve the social situations of the Haitians every day. So we're still working away at our original projects. We've just had to call in for help to respond to the immediate emergency. And I have to say that people have been very responsive to this.

MARTIN: What happens to the migrants living in this camp after it's dismantled? KONFORTI: So tomorrow, we will have several thousand people that go into accommodation centers throughout France in order to pursue their request for asylum. However, about half of them will not do this. And the big question is where do those people go? This camp, as difficult as the living conditions were, provided some shelter, some food, some clothing, some social ties. So this is going to be very, very difficult. MARTIN: Are they expected to just be absorbed into different aid agencies or shelters around France? KONFORTI: Just the people who are ready to ask for asylum. These will go into accommodation centers. The government dreams that it will be able to put the people who don't want to go - to ask for asylum in those same accommodation centers. However, if they go there, they will be forced to go back to their countries. The government has told those people, if we find you still hanging around Calais, trying to go to the U. K. , we will arrest you. And so we can only expect in the next few weeks literally a manhunt around Calais. MARTIN: I understand there are also unaccompanied minors who've been living in this camp. KONFORTI: Yes. So 1,200 unaccompanied minors in this camp. The French government has worked out a deal with the British government to allow the unaccompanied minors that have close family in the U. K. to go legally to the U. K. , but it only accounts for about 300 of the children. So you have another 900 or 1,000 for which we need to decide what to do. The French government, they want to put the children in what we call the container camp, which is the only humanitarian thing that the government had set up in Calais. However, this is not a legally proper structure for minors. MARTIN: Why is the camp being closed now? I mean, especially because migrants are still arriving. What are the external forces that are playing into this? KONFORTI: It's all a political thing. The government likes to call it a humanitarian operation. I can tell you it's going to be a humanitarian catastrophe, you know, that's sending people on the street. And we're at the eve of winter. And in France, there's a special rule whereby between the first of November and the first of March you cannot put somebody on the street.

For a broad look at this offensive, we are joined now by Jessica Lewis McFate. She's research director at the Institute for the Study of War in Washington D. C. Thanks for being with us. JESSICA LEWIS MCFATE: Thank you so much for having me. MCEVERS: So the U. S. and Iraqi governments say that the battle for Mosul is going well. Brett McGurk, the U. S. envoy to the coalition that's fighting ISIS, said in a tweet today, all objectives have been met thus far. What is your assessment of how this operation is going? MCFATE: Well, tactically and operationally, it is going well. The counteroffensive against ISIS with coalition members on the ground and in the air is proceeding north, east and south of Mosul and are making significant gains. So the offensive is proceeding now towards the outskirts of Mosul on the east side, which is a significant progress rate. MCEVERS: You talk about how they're closing in from the north, east and south, but when - you know, when you look at the maps of this, we're seeing that there's not a whole lot going on in the west. And that of course would be the way that presumably ISIS fighters could escape from Mosul and head into Syria. Why are they letting these fighters get away that way? Why are they not closing that corridor? MCFATE: Well, the majority of what exists outside of Mosul in the west is open desert. So on the one hand, it is a good planning assumption that if ISIS tries to withdraw by fleeing into the desert, that that withdrawal will be visible from the air. . . MCEVERS: I see. MCFATE: . . . And it will be possible to strike. The exception of course is any significant movement of refugees fleeing into Syria from Mosul with whom ISIS could also mask its own escape. And it is a vulnerability in the operation that ISIS could withdraw. However, I do think it is also appropriate to recognize that reclaiming Mosul is the significant objective of the operation regardless of whether or not all ISIS members are contained there. MCEVERS: We just heard in Alice Fordham's report from villagers near Mosul, and they talked about these tunnels between villages to smuggle ISIS fighters, to smuggle weapons. How much of a concern is that for Iraqi forces and their allies? MCFATE: Well, tunnels first and foremost are going to slow down the operation. As fighters are trying to retake villages and finding tunnel networks that also had to be cleared, it is literally a subterranean war that has to be fought on the ground, and that could cause various portions of the operation to proceed more slowly. If tunnels are not sufficiently cleared, it could also mean that counter-ISIS forces end up surrounded by ISIS forces. . . MCEVERS: Right. MCFATE: If ISIS forces are rolled over too quickly and allowed to attack friendly forces from two directions, that of course means that clearing the tunnels is very important. MCEVERS: ISIS has been launching counter attacks in recent days, most notably in the city of Kirkuk, which is not part of this offensive. Why would they take fighters away from Mosul? MCFATE: ISIS has fighters in place throughout Iraq and throughout Syria and honestly in other places in the region who clearly had been lying in wait for the Mosul counter-offensive to begin in order to participate in Mosul's strategic defense. So ISIS likely did not send fighters to Kirkuk. It had fighters there, and it deployed them in conjunction with the Mosul offensive. So we see that ISIS is very clearly trying to divert attention away from the Mosul operation, perhaps even in the case of Kurkuk, trying to draw Kurdish Peshmerga forces away from Mosul and back to the defense of Kirkuk. We haven't seen yet whether or not ISIS will be successful. MCEVERS: Jessica Lewis McFate is research director at the Institute for the Study of War. Thank you. MCFATE: Thank you very much.

Yesterday, Turkish forces got in the fight, firing on ISIS positions. To get a sense of what those refugees are experiencing and what's ahead for the many more - possibly hundreds of thousands more who are expected to flee - we turn to Ruaridh Villar of Save the Children via Skype. Good morning. RUARIDH VILLAR: Good morning. MONTAGNE: Now, I gather you have been visiting some of the camps where civilians around Mosul have fled to. Describe the conditions for us. VILLAR: Well, that's right. I'm just back from the town of Qayyarah, which is about 50 miles to the south of Mosul. I'm very close, indeed, to the front line with IS fighters. Now, this town is veiled in a plume of thick, dark black smoke from - smoke from oil wells that IS fighters set alight when they retreated from the town. And the whole town is covered in a dusting of black grime. And we met children and mothers, and they were covered in it. Children's hands were black. Their feet were black. Their hair was matted. And mothers told me that they're deeply worried about the health, now, of their children. The children are coughing. And they told me their bodies were covered in rashes. And right now the area designated by the United Nations as a safe area for displaced people to be is one that is filled with smoke from oil wells. MONTAGNE: Have you talked to families, as they've emerged, to find out if they're coming out together? Or are some families separated from each other as they flee Mosul? VILLAR: Well, one thing that struck us was there was a very clear picture. It was lone mothers with their children. And mother after mother told us that as the Iraqi army approached their village, IS had taken away their husbands and their brothers. And they had been left alone with their children. Now, some mothers said that when the Iraqi army arrived, they took them away immediately with just the clothes on their backs. And they didn't even have time to take their identity documents. The village - villages and towns around Mosul, where we're seeing people flee from now, have been under the control of Islamic State fighters. Now, this is a situation where the possession of a SIM card for a telephone leads to execution. Any hint of an attempt to flee or sympathy for the Iraqi coalition forces would similarly lead to execution. So many of these families could not make preparations to leave before the conflict swept over them. But the other thing I should mention is that right now, we're just not seeing people fleeing from inside Mosul city itself. These are the towns and villages to the south, to the north. And that's what we're responding to at the moment. But it's not a clean conflict. It's not some smooth siege around Mosul city itself. There are front lines, and there are small battles all the way up the 200-kilometer corridor leading to Mosul itself. MONTAGNE: And is there any difference between - we're talking about Mosul, a very big city - between, say, the north and the south? That is, are there significant differences between the readiness of some areas to provide shelter? VILLAR: Well, right now there isn't shelter ready. That's the problem. We know there are at least half a million children trapped inside Mosul right now. We don't know when, how many and in what direction they're going to flee. But we have maybe 60,000 shelter places ready for people who might escape. Now, we're expecting potentially up to a million people to flee. That's just simply not good enough. We've known this is a potential risk for months now. But international donors have not provided the funding that agencies need. MONTAGNE: Of all the families that you have met since this began in recent days, is there one story that has really stuck with you? VILLAR: Yes, I met one mother. And she told me that her husband had refused to join IS. Fighters had arrived. They'd taken all the household belongings out of her home, and they burnt them in front of them and then abducted her husband. It was at that point, she and her eight children decided to flee. And they'd had to pay a hundred dollars at every village they reached just so the local people would tell them a safe route through the mine fields. And we gave her water and emergency supplies. She had nothing. And she said to me, look, thank you. But what I need most right now is an education for my children. They're clever. They've been out of school for two years, and I want them to go back to school. And that really struck me because we often think about food and water being the priority in a response like this. But children have been out of school for two years. Parents have been terrified about sending their children to school, which is being run by IS and based around extreme violence. MONTAGNE: Well, thank you very much for talking with us. VILLAR: Thank you very much. MONTAGNE: Ruaridh Villar of Save the Children, speaking to us from Erbil, Iraq. RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST:  Thousands of residents who've been trapped by the Islamic State in the areas around Mosul have fled as Iraqi and Kurdish forces fight to take back Iraq's second-biggest city. Yesterday, Turkish forces got in the fight, firing on ISIS positions. To get a sense of what those refugees are experiencing and what's ahead for the many more - possibly hundreds of thousands more who are expected to flee - we turn to Ruaridh Villar of Save the Children via Skype. Good morning. RUARIDH VILLAR: Good morning. MONTAGNE: Now, I gather you have been visiting some of the camps where civilians around Mosul have fled to. Describe the conditions for us. VILLAR: Well, that's right. I'm just back from the town of Qayyarah, which is about 50 miles to the south of Mosul. I'm very close, indeed, to the front line with IS fighters. Now, this town is veiled in a plume of thick, dark black smoke from - smoke from oil wells that IS fighters set alight when they retreated from the town. And the whole town is covered in a dusting of black grime. And we met children and mothers, and they were covered in it. Children's hands were black. Their feet were black. Their hair was matted. And mothers told me that they're deeply worried about the health, now, of their children. The children are coughing. And they told me their bodies were covered in rashes. And right now the area designated by the United Nations as a safe area for displaced people to be is one that is filled with smoke from oil wells. MONTAGNE: Have you talked to families, as they've emerged, to find out if they're coming out together? Or are some families separated from each other as they flee Mosul? VILLAR: Well, one thing that struck us was there was a very clear picture. It was lone mothers with their children. And mother after mother told us that as the Iraqi army approached their village, IS had taken away their husbands and their brothers. And they had been left alone with their children. Now, some mothers said that when the Iraqi army arrived, they took them away immediately with just the clothes on their backs. And they didn't even have time to take their identity documents. The village - villages and towns around Mosul, where we're seeing people flee from now, have been under the control of Islamic State fighters. Now, this is a situation where the possession of a SIM card for a telephone leads to execution. Any hint of an attempt to flee or sympathy for the Iraqi coalition forces would similarly lead to execution. So many of these families could not make preparations to leave before the conflict swept over them. But the other thing I should mention is that right now, we're just not seeing people fleeing from inside Mosul city itself. These are the towns and villages to the south, to the north. And that's what we're responding to at the moment. But it's not a clean conflict. It's not some smooth siege around Mosul city itself. There are front lines, and there are small battles all the way up the 200-kilometer corridor leading to Mosul itself. MONTAGNE: And is there any difference between - we're talking about Mosul, a very big city - between, say, the north and the south? That is, are there significant differences between the readiness of some areas to provide shelter? VILLAR: Well, right now there isn't shelter ready. That's the problem. We know there are at least half a million children trapped inside Mosul right now. We don't know when, how many and in what direction they're going to flee. But we have maybe 60,000 shelter places ready for people who might escape. Now, we're expecting potentially up to a million people to flee. That's just simply not good enough. We've known this is a potential risk for months now. But international donors have not provided the funding that agencies need. MONTAGNE: Of all the families that you have met since this began in recent days, is there one story that has really stuck with you? VILLAR: Yes, I met one mother. And she told me that her husband had refused to join IS. Fighters had arrived. They'd taken all the household belongings out of her home, and they burnt them in front of them and then abducted her husband. It was at that point, she and her eight children decided to flee. And they'd had to pay a hundred dollars at every village they reached just so the local people would tell them a safe route through the mine fields. And we gave her water and emergency supplies. She had nothing. And she said to me, look, thank you. But what I need most right now is an education for my children. They're clever. They've been out of school for two years, and I want them to go back to school. And that really struck me because we often think about food and water being the priority in a response like this.

But 14 years on, the court which is based in the Hague is losing members - first Burundi, then South Africa said they would pull out. Other African countries have said they might do the same. I talked to Alex Whiting about this. He's a professor at Harvard Law School who used to work in the Office of the Prosecutor at the ICC. And we started with Burundi's decision to leave the court. ALEX WHITING: Last April, the prosecutor at the International Criminal Court announced that she was starting a preliminary examination into crimes, murder, torture, sexual violence that occurred in Burundi, and the government has apparently decided that rather than face that inquiry and face potential accountability, it will instead pull out of the International Criminal Court and avoid any kind of accountability. MCEVERS: So it seems like a fairly straightforward decision. What about South Africa? Their decision to withdraw I understand comes after a visit there last year by the Sudanese president. What happened there? WHITING: The story with South Africa is a little bit more complicated because of course South Africa's not under any investigation by the court. But Omar al-Bashir visited South Africa in June of 2015. And Bashir is himself wanted on an arrest warrant by the International Criminal Court, and the government failed to execute the arrest warrant of the International Criminal Court and arrest him and instead allowed him to leave the country. And they were called to task by the domestic courts for failing to honor their international and domestic legal obligations to arrest and also for failing to abide by a court order to keep him in the country while the issue was sorted out. And I think it's in light of this embarrassment domestically that the government has decided to itself withdraw from the court. MCEVERS: And now, you know, we've got other countries in Africa - Kenya, Namibia, Uganda - talking about leaving, and there's this claim that there's bias, that the court is biased against African nations. WHITING: It is true that 9 of its 10 current investigations are in Africa, but it's not a result of bias. It's because the court can only prosecute where it has jurisdiction and where it has a reasonable prospect of having successful investigations. And today, those cases have been in Africa. MCEVERS: Give us some examples of where that wouldn't apply. WHITING: The obvious candidate is Syria, where there's evidence of massive crimes being committed. But the court doesn't have jurisdiction in Syria, whereas it does have jurisdiction in Africa. MCEVERS: The United States has not joined the court - same with China, Russia, Israel, many other countries. Does this now give them more reason not to join? WHITING: No, I don't think so. I think it would be a mistake to see this event of South Africa, Burundi, maybe a couple of other African countries deciding to leave the court as catastrophic or the end of the International Criminal Court. The court has been in existence only for 14 years. And if you take the long view, countries like the United States and China and Russia have to decide that either joining the court or finding other ways to ensure that there is international criminal accountability in places like Syria and other places around the world - and that's, to bring it back to the question about Africa - that's the real problem. The real problem is not a bias of the court, but the real problem is the uneven justice around the world. MCEVERS: Alex Whiting is a professor at Harvard Law School. Thank you very much.

They're embedded with both the Kurdish fighters known as the peshmerga and Iraqi forces, and they've been live-streaming the fight against ISIS online. Recently, a crew from the network Rudaw came under attack live on the air. Among those watching was head of digital media Hemin Lihony. HEMIN LIHONY: An ISIS car bomb picked a group of peshmerga soldier as a target and drove to them very fast, full speed. We were glued to the screen, wondering if we were going to see this death of our own colleagues live on the TV. MONTAGNE: That vehicle was destroyed, hit by a rocket before it reached its target or those journalists. Broadcasting live on Facebook is not new. The social network pays NPR for videos we produce, for example. But Lihony says the tool is allowing Rudaw to be more nimble on the battlefield. LIHONY: For the live-stream, I can see we have two cameramen. We have sent them to the battlefield from different fronts. We keep in touch with them. When they see bombing or a big smoking, when they see airstrikes, they just call us and they inform us to be ready to go live. We give instant access to everyone to watch the battle live and they have their feeling at the same time - sad faces, like, dislike. MONTAGNE: Well, definitely I - sounds right that it's the first time anybody has been reacting to these kinds of scenes with emojis. Does it strike you at all as strange given the seriousness of the subject matter? LIHONY: Of course. We have to tell people welcome to the new world of technology. We have to get used to it. We have to study it. And also there are some families. They are watching our live-stream. They care about their sons and daughters who are now fighting, and they want to see them because we interview the peshmerga and the fighters. Reporters ask them how are the battle, and some of them their colleagues killed in the battle. It is really very tragedy and very, very sad moments sometimes. It's very hurting. MONTAGNE: But you don't show all of that it doesn't seem like. LIHONY: Of course, no, no, we monitor it. MONTAGNE: Right. So then, I mean, there is a limit. I mean, certainly to the - although I've seen bodies. LIHONY: Yeah, as I said, they are disadvantage to live-streaming. You have to ensure that the content does not include graphic footage of militants, yeah, injured soldiers because we don't know who is watching actually and how old they are and where they are from. This mean our team member are constantly monitoring the live-stream, and they do actually, to ensure it's stopped when needed. MONTAGNE: You know, because it's new - it's a new kind of coverage, obviously you're feeling your way through this. You got some pushback. . . LIHONY: Yeah. MONTAGNE: . . . For some coverage that you sent out a drone video following peshmerga convoy outside of Mosul. And people were saying, what do you want, to get the peshmerga killed? Like, that you were helping ISIS unintentionally. LIHONY: Actually, the drone footage, it was after the battle, not at the same time. Peshmerga went this villages and they controlled all of them. It's not close to the ISIS. MONTAGNE: So you were in what you might call friendly territory when you took these photographs. So there was no question of them being used for an attack. LIHONY: Yeah, yeah, yeah. With - this is work of media, to show everything. I think it's quite ironic that of course Islamic State uses the platforms such as Twitter and Facebook - yeah? - to make their cause known to recruit jihadis.

He fought in Iraq with the Marines and the Special Forces, and he recently went back to Iraq on assignment for Esquire magazine. He spent time with Iraqi counterterrorism forces who are fighting to retake Mosul from ISIS. These troops have been trained by the U. S. They're well-equipped, and they are supposed to represent all of Iraq. But Ackerman says that's not how it looked to him. ELLIOT ACKERMAN: From the back of their Humvees, you know, they're flying the Shia flags as they go towards Mosul. You know, and these are the supposedly secular forces that are - you're not supposed to be participating in any of the sectarian violence. You know, in the West, when we think of the Islamic State, I think what's first and foremost in our consciousness are these terrorist attacks, whether it's Paris or the Istanbul airport or the cells that have operated in the United States. But when you're on the ground in Iraq, what's really evident is that, you know, this is a Sunni-versus-Shia fight. And the Sunnis are represented by the Islamic State. And brutal as they are, a lot of everyday Sunnis are sort of withholding judgment to see what it's going to be like under the Iraqi security forces. And when the supposedly nonsectarian security forces come in flying Shiite banners, you know, it certainly sends the wrong message. And it's probably in the long run going to make work more difficult for the Iraqi security forces in securing Mosul and winning over the support of the Sunni population there. MCEVERS: You also went back to Fallujah. That's a place where you fought in what's called the second battle for Fallujah in late 2004. Fallujah has now gone through its fourth major battle. Iraqi forces have routed ISIS out of that city. What's it like now? ACKERMAN: Well, progress in Fallujah has been very slow. Only about a quarter of the population has come back to the city, and there's still no water in the city. There's no power. There's no sanitation. So the people who are there basically bring in their own potable water, and they're living off of generators. So if Fallujah is any predictor of what the rebuilding of a Mosul is like, you know, there are significant challenges ahead. MCEVERS: What was it like for you to be back there? ACKERMAN: You know, I mean I have a lot of memories having fought in that battle. And I wanted to visit a couple of key places, particularly where some friends had been killed. You know, the thing that was most striking to me is that in some respects, absolutely nothing had changed. You know, I remember standing on a rooftop that I - the platoon I was with - we wound up fighting basically a 12-hour firefight from this rooftop, and a number of us were hurt. And I was looking down, standing there today, looking down at that rooftop, and there was a very small cinderblock wall that formed a corner probably only four or five cinder blocks tall. And I remember when we ran out of this house in the middle of this firefight crouching down behind those five little cinder blocks. And I've thought about that day, to be honest, probably almost every day since it happened. And then coming back and looking at those five little cinder blocks and they haven't moved - you know, it sort of causes you to reflect on how much can change in your life and how absolutely nothing can change in these places that are so significant to you. MCEVERS: The United States invaded Iraq in 2003. We've been going to this place and - or talking about this place for 13 years now. I mean how many more years do you think Americans are going to be involved in Iraq? ACKERMAN: I wish I had an answer to that question. You know, I mean, you know, as much as the conflict that we're seeing in Iraq and Syria right now, you know, is really sort of a - it is an existential crisis for, you know, what is the future of Islam, what is the future of the Middle East? But I think what often gets missed - it's also a somewhat existential crisis for how the U. S. and in particular the U. S. military is engaged in the world. A war of this length in our country is without precedent. You know, the way we're fighting it is without precedent, you know, with an all-volunteer army and for many of the years in the past through deficit spending so no one spends more taxes. You know, so I hope as we go forward, you know, as a country, we can start asking ourselves questions. You know, is this the way we want to fight our wars? Are these wars we even want to fight? You know, what are the implications going forward in terms of perhaps the moral hazard we run if we keep outsourcing these wars to a very small sliver of our society?

NPR's Michele Kelemen explains why. MICHELE KELEMEN, BYLINE: U. S. Ambassador Samantha Power was among those applauding enthusiastically when the resolution calling for an end of the U. S. embargo on Cuba sailed through the General Assembly in a 191 to 0 vote. (APPLAUSE)KELEMEN: It was a surprising scene, but Ambassador Power says the U.

The statements have been coming thick and fast. Disgraceful, insulting, a bone-headed decision are just some of the ways the move is being described. NPR's Pentagon correspondent Tom Bowman has been following this story, and he's here to tell us where all of this righteous indignation might be headed. Tom, good morning. TOM BOWMAN, BYLINE: Good morning, Renee. MONTAGNE: First of all, do we have any clearer sense about why this is happening? BOWMAN: Well, Renee, first of all, the bottom line is that California National Guard, a decade ago, gave out millions of dollars in improper re-enlistment bonuses. Now, the bonuses were supposed to be narrowly targeted to key jobs - you know, linguists, special operations soldiers, civil affairs and the like. But thousands of Guard soldiers got them undeservedly because a California Guard was worried about losing soldiers. They had to keep their re-enlistments up. And remember, this is right in the middle of two wars. There were a lot of casualties at that time. So an investigation led to a jail term for a Guard recruiter. Others were implicated, too. And the Guard started an investigation that was recently completed. And they concluded, listen, we want the money back. California National Guard says, we have no choice; we can't waive these bonuses. The law says we have to get that money. Now, the Guard says it reached out to congressmen and other federal leaders, Renee, two years ago, encouraging them to forgive these debts. Not much happened until this past weekend, after a front-page story in the LA Times by David Cloud. MONTAGNE: And, of course, the veterans themselves, what are they saying about what happened to them? BOWMAN: Well, some veterans have ignored the repayment letters. Others have filed lawsuits. And many are writing their congressmen. And some veterans, like Chris Van Meter, who was wounded in Iraq, have paid up. At first, he told me the Guard started to garner his wages - 20 percent of his wages. And then this is what he said to me. CHRIS VAN METER: I owed $46,000 through a re-enlistment bonus, a student loan repayment and an officer accession bonus. BOWMAN: So Chris Van Meter told me he was stunned and angry when he was told to repay four years ago, with interest. Now, he never thought he got too much in bonuses. He thought they were deserved. And when he reached out to the Guard recently for help, they just told him, listen, you're just going to have to pay for this. MONTAGNE: Well, we're talking here about California, but are there troops from elsewhere in the country who are - might have been affected? BOWMAN: Well, Congress is looking into that now. Clearly, California had the biggest problem. There was criminal activity here. We know there have been reports about some improper payments in Oregon, New Mexico. And I'm told those audits are ongoing. And NPR reporters say the Guard is telling them they have no problems in other states, for example, Illinois, North Carolina and Tennessee. So the situation is different around the country. You know, right now, nobody seems to have a complete picture on this. And, of course, with these stories about it coming out now, there's a lot of focus, a lot of attention on it. MONTAGNE: So what about Congress? I mean, if they were - if it was informed - so going to do something now? BOWMAN: Well, first, you know, congressmen are saying, we want the Guard to try to stop these getting - trying to get back this money. And some congressmen are saying, we'll just add language in the upcoming defense bill to waive those repayments, right? But even if it stops, what happens to people who repaid their mistaken bonuses, like Chris Van Meter? Do they get the money back? There's still a lot of questions about how this is going to be resolved. MONTAGNE: That's NPR Pentagon correspondent Tom Bowman. Thanks very much. BOWMAN: You're welcome, Renee.

The inaugural parade and the festivities are over, and the new president of the United States is ready for his or her first day of work. NPR's Scott Horsley reports on what we might expect from a President Trump or a President Clinton on that first day and the 99 days that follow. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: The new president's first full day in office will be a Saturday, so they could take it easy, sleep in. But that's not likely. After a seemingly endless campaign, both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are eager to get down to business. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)DONALD TRUMP: What follows is my 100-day action plan to make America great again. HORSLEY: Trump recently sketched out his ambitious blueprint with a speech in Gettysburg, Pa. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: First, I will announce my intention to totally renegotiate NAFTA, one of the worst deals our country has ever made. HORSLEY: Trump also promises to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific trade deal that's been in the works. Benjamin Wittes of the Brookings Institution says both those moves would be well within the new president's authority. BENJAMIN WITTES: As a general matter, if the president wants to withdraw from a treaty, he simply gets to do that. And that's part of the powers of the office. HORSLEY: Trump would also have the power to make good on his pledge to deport more than 2 million immigrant criminals, to halt immigration from parts of the world he calls terror prone and to steer federal agencies in a sharply different direction than President Obama has. STEPHEN MOORE: You could literally have a stack of executive orders on Donald Trump's desk in the Oval Office that he could sign literally in his first hours of being president. HORSLEY: Campaign advisor Stephen Moore says Trump would act almost immediately to reverse the power plant rules at the heart of Obama's climate agenda, to undo orders limiting energy exploration and to cancel the reprieve from deportation that Obama granted to immigrants who were smuggled into the country as children. MOORE: If you're an administration that lives by the executive order, then you're going to die by the executive order, too. HORSLEY: Other parts of Trump's agenda would need support from a friendly Republican Congress. Those include his $6 trillion tax cut, the repeal of Obamacare and that big wall along the Southwest border with Mexico. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: Remember I said Mexico's paying for the wall - with the full understanding that the country of Mexico will be reimbursing the United States for the full cost of such a wall. HORSLEY: Hillary Clinton, meanwhile, has her own roadmap for the first hundred days if she winds up in the White House. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)HILLARY CLINTON: We're not going to build a giant wall. We're going to build roads and bridges and tunnels and ports and airports and water systems and a new electric grid. HORSLEY: Clinton told supporters in Johnstown, Pa. , this summer she'll also pursue immigration reform and big new investments in clean energy. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)CLINTON: Within the first 100 days of our administration, we are going to break the gridlock in Washington and make the biggest investment in new good-paying jobs since World War II. HORSLEY: Most of Clinton's plans would require congressional support. And because the House - if not the Senate - is expected to remain in Republican hands, former GOP Congressman Tom Davis says that will test Clinton's negotiating skills. TOM DAVIS: She was a senator. She was a fairly successful legislator. And her husband was just very good at working with a Republican Congress. She's got that in her background, but the world has changed since that time. HORSLEY: Washington, like the rest of the country, has grown more polarized. And Davis warns either Clinton or Trump will face strong political headwinds from their very first day in office. DAVIS: Remember this, the president, whoever it is, will come in with a high negative, probably close to 55 percent unfavorable view. That's not the traditional kind of mandate. HORSLEY: Even if there's no traditional honeymoon, though, whoever sits in the Oval Office will still wield considerable power, from nominating Supreme Court justices to pulling the many levers of the federal bureaucracy. Presidents generally try to deliver on their campaign promises, and in many cases they succeed. So, for better or worse, Benjamin Wittes us of the Brookings Institution says voters should take these pledges seriously. WITTES: When somebody promises to do something, you have to think about whether that's something that you would be willing to see happen because the powers are simply too vast. HORSLEY: And this election will entrust those powers to one of these candidates for far more than 100 days. Scott Horsley, NPR News, the White House.

It's that of a child who knows much hardship lies ahead. She was right. Sharbat Gula was about 12 when her picture was taken. She had fled Afghanistan after the Soviets invaded, killing her parents in an airstrike. Photographer Steve McCurry stumbled across her in a refugee camp in northwest Pakistan.

Gula is one of several million Afghans in Pakistan who've sought refuge from war back home. Most are registered refugees, but many are undocumented. Gula is accused of having forged ID papers. That's why she was arrested. Pakistan's government has previously set deadlines for the Afghans' repatriation and then postponed these. Now there's a new deadline, next spring.

Duterte made international headlines for his profane descriptions of President Obama and Secretary of State Kerry. Too bad God didn't get in touch before Duterte called the pope a son of a - oh.

But her planned three-week trip ended up lasting months and included 112 harrowing days in Iran's notorious Evin prison. HOMA HOODFAR: I didn't experience physical violence except that I could not sleep in the cell because the lights were on all the time. And also there were very little air in this very small cell.

It's the last major city in Iraq that's still in the grasp of the militant group. But now, after two weeks of fighting outside the city with U. S. assistance in the form of advisers and air strikes, the Iraqi counterterror forces have battled their way through to the outskirts of the city itself. More than a million people are thought to be living there still. NPR's Alice Fordham is in northern Iraq. And Alice, first, what more can you tell us about this latest advance? ALICE FORDHAM, BYLINE: Well, what the Iraqi security forces are doing now is just beginning to push into the eastern edge of the city proper. These are the counterterror forces that are leading this attack. And it's a culmination of a series of battles led by those counterterror forces but with other Iraqi security forces and American support. And what they've done is they have moved through deserted villages to the east of the city, where they faced resistance from ISIS. And they took a lot of casualties, but they also moved reasonably quickly. Commanders are now telling state media that they have taken the state TV station just on the eastern edge of Mosul, and now they're moving into neighborhoods. In terms of the kind of fighting that we're seeing here, it's now likely to change. These forces are moving from basically depopulated areas with small villages and open spaces into a densely populated urban area, so their progress is now likely to slow down. ISIS has dug in. We've reached people inside Mosul, and they're terrified of what happens next. CORNISH: And this is just one part of Mosul - right? - one side of the city. What about the rest of the area? FORDHAM: Right. So there are forces also progressing from all different directions. The Iraqi security forces are all working together, but there's a whole array of them. There's the army. There's the federal police. There's tribal fighters. There's paramilitaries. And they're moving at different rates, partly because some of them are moving through populated areas, which is slower going, and partly for political reasons. Things are complicated by the ethnic mix here in Mosul and in northern Iraq, more generally. CORNISH: But tell us more about that. What's going on with the demographics that's affecting all this? FORDHAM: Well, it's a very diverse area, and it has deep ethnic and sectarian divisions. So part of the forces that we have seen moving on Mosul are Kurdish forces in the north, which are Iraqi. They're known as Peshmerga. And they have been a big part of the initial effort to move into the area around Mosul, but they made an agreement that they wouldn't move further forward than where they are now around the north and eastern edge of Mosul because there's concerns that they would try to expand the ethnic Kurdish sphere of influence. And another thing that we're seeing is over to the west of the city there are Shiite Muslim paramilitary forces moving in. But they're moving into an area that's populated by another ethnic minority - they're ethnic Turkmen. And Turkey says that it feels a kind of connection with these ethnic Turkmen. They're very close to Turkey. And Turkey has threatened to attack these Shiite paramilitary forces. It's even massing some troops on the border if they move into this ethnic Turkmen area. So it's a complicated set of operations. CORNISH: And amidst all this, you have a million people still living in Mosul, right? I mean, what's going on with civilians? FORDHAM: Well, that is kind of the unanswered question, and it depends on how the fighting plays out in the city. One thing that ISIS has done previously is use people essentially as human shields. We're getting credible reports from inside the city that they have forcibly moved civilians from villages nearby to the city to use them as human shields. Another thing that might happen is that people might just get caught up in the fighting and be unable to escape. Or hundreds of thousands of people could flee and overwhelm aid agencies' capacity to assist them. CORNISH: That's NPR's Alice Fordham speaking to us in northern Iraq. Alice, thanks so much.

Iraqi forces, with U. S. support, are now on the outskirts of the city. Mosul has been under the control of ISIS for more than two years with a million, perhaps more, people still living there. We've got NPR's Alice Fordham on the line. She is covering the offensive in northern Iraq. And Alice, what is the latest? ALICE FORDHAM, BYLINE: Well, so elite counterterror forces are now on the eastern edge of the city. There are slightly different definitions of where the city begins, which area is a village outside and which is a neighborhood of the city. But either way, they're either there or they will be once they have advanced a few hundred more meters. And they are moving pretty fast. Now, it's important to note that the southern and the western fronts still have a ways to go. The forces that are fighting against ISIS in those areas are not on the outskirts of the city. The counterterror forces are pushing into the eastern area on their own. But there's no doubt that this is a huge psychological moment for Iraq. Mosul fell to ISIS more than two years ago, almost without a fight. It was a colossal failure to the army and the federal police who were holding the city at the time. So people here have been waiting for this moment, also somewhat anxiously. MONTAGNE: And the U. N. has been saying that the Islamic State has taken thousands of villagers into the city to serve as human shields. Are you seeing any sign of that yet? FORDHAM: Yeah, Renee. We have actually been able to reach people inside Mosul who say that they have, indeed, seen and spoken to people who have been forcibly displaced from villages south of the city and brought up to Mosul. They're living in abandoned buildings now. They said that they were tricked into coming. They were told they'd only be leaving their homes for a short time. We presume that they will be used as human shields. That's something that I've seen myself before in another Iraqi city, Ramadi. And ISIS have done this in other places. And people inside Mosul confirmed to us also that there are thousands of ISIS fighters there. They have erected defenses, and they have dug tunnels under houses that we now know go on for miles in some cases. MONTAGNE: Well, it sounds as though this will be a very harsh, urban combat situation once Iraqi forces actually enter the city. Is there a way to know how it will play out? FORDHAM: Yeah. The counterterror forces along with the Iraqi army and the Kurdish forces known as Peshmerga on this eastern front, thus far, have been fighting their way through depopulated areas. There's still been considerable resistance from ISIS. But fighting in a populated, urban area is much more difficult. And I've been through some of those villages that have been retaken. The destruction that is striking. So all the indications are that it is going to be worse inside Mosul. The assumption is that ISIS will fight hard for this. This is their most prominent, their most popular city. And accounts from inside the city suggest ISIS still have support there. There's a long-term mistrust of Iraqi authorities inside Mosul.

But it is really part of a bigger picture that stretches beyond the United States. In fact, Donald Trump's message to anyone who doubts he can win - look at what happened in the United Kingdom last summer. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)DONALD TRUMP: Believe me, this is Brexit times five. You watch what's going to happen. GREENE: Brexit, that was the vote to leave the EU in June. It was fueled by some of the same issues that Donald Trump is tapping into in his campaign. And to look more closely at the similarities and perhaps differences, we turn to NPR national political correspondent Don Gonyea and NPR's London correspondent Frank Langfitt. Guys, good morning. DON GONYEA, BYLINE: Good morning. FRANK LANGFITT, BYLINE: Hey, good morning, Dave. GREENE: Now I know you both are back from reporting trips. You, Don, in the United States and you, Frank, in the U. K. and you're going to compare notes. Don, let me just start with you. Where'd you go? GONYEA: So I went to two towns, both in far Southwestern Pennsylvania. GREENE: My old neck of the woods, near Pittsburgh, right? GONYEA: Monessen and Washington, Pa. GREENE: Which is more Pittsburgh than Pittsburgh. This is, like, coal mining steel country. GONYEA: And nothing like Washington, D. C. , we should add. GREENE: Very true. GONYEA: So this remains coal country. It used to also be steel country. But tens of thousands - literally - of steel jobs have been lost over the past few decades. Fair to call it Trump country this election. GREENE: OK. Frank, you? LANGFITT: I was in Southeastern England along the coast in a place called Margate, an old seaside resort. And like Don's areas, it suffered from globalization and technology, specifically jet travel and sort of discount packages to places like Spain decimated the tourism business there. And this place voted very strongly for Brexit. GREENE: OK. So it sounds like these are similar kinds of places. But I want to hear more. I mean, what did you guys find in common? LANGFITT: Well, I did talk to Don. And I think one thing we found is some similar themes. Certainly where I was, a lot of frustration with immigration. Margate's close to the English Channel. A lot of EU migrants pouring into the schools there, making it hard, frankly, for teachers to teach. I was talking to a pub owner. Her name's Ali Burke, she runs the Bulls Head. And her daughter actually had to translate for other students in school and was falling behind academically. And Ali said all this was kind of just overwhelming. ALI BURKE: I don't think anyone in this country has a problem with a certain amount of migration. It's just - there's too many. You know, we've got to draw the line somewhere. And we have got to start putting our own country first. I do believe that. GONYEA: And, David, in the town of Monessen, I talked to the mayor. He's 79-year-old retired steel worker Lou Mavrakis. First - and this is his important thing - he says communities like his have been ignored. He says billions have been spent on unnecessary wars. And that's cash that could have been used to revive a town like his. On immigration, the mayor says it's not a huge worry to him. But he does use really strong language to say they need to do it legally the way his Greek immigrant father did. LOU MAVRAKIS: Today what you have here, you pick up that phone and you try to call and say - press one for English, press two for se habla espanol. I mean, come on, you know. Now we have people that are coming across the border and they expect us to speak their language to accommodate them. I mean, that's [expletive]. You, know if you want to come to this country, learn the language. GREENE: OK, some strong views there. Let me ask you guys both this question. I mean, both of these movements driven - it sounds like, in large part - by economic frustration. Fair to say? GONYEA: Oh, yeah. And that's the main thing you hear over and over, even from people who have jobs. I spoke with Christina and Frank Zacconne over their kitchen table in Washington, Pa. He's a coal miner. She's a stay-at-home mom. Here's her take on the economy. CHRISTINA ZACCONNE: Statistically they say things are better, but you don't notice it here where we are. With the downturn in coal, with manufacturing leaving, with all that stuff happening, I mean, it's just in shambles. GONYEA: So her husband, Frank, is working as a miner. It's actually been a decent year for him. He's getting some overtime, but there are no guarantees. And they think Hillary Clinton would kill the coal industry, though Clinton says she wants to invest in new jobs in places like this. GREENE: Frank? LANGFITT: Yeah. So when I was in Margate, I talked to Rachel Parker (ph). She's 20 years old. She works at Bargain Busters, it's a discount store in the area. And she, you know, said after the decline of tourism, no new industry has emerged there. Rachel also told me this, I mean, it really made me so sad. She said only 20 percent of her high school class has a job. And I was talking to her dad, Chris (ph), who owns the store. And he says there's just no opportunity for young people. CHRIS PARKER: Possibly about the last 10 years, slowly got worse and worse and worse. It's like this seems to be forgotten. It's like a dumping ground. GREENE: God, the feeling of forgotten, it sounds like you're hearing that on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean. I wonder who people are blaming in these communities. Frank, let me start with you. LANGFITT: Yeah, sure. I mean, in Margate you just hear talk about the political elites, certainly in London but also Brussels. That's home, of course, of the European Union and where a lot of these migrants are coming from. GONYEA: And I heard the exact same thing in Pennsylvania, but with public enemy number one being Washington. David, listen to these two voices. We're going to play them back to back, one in Margate, the other in U. S. coal country. BURKE: So I think they're out of touch. I mean, they live in their bubble. They live in - obviously a land where there's plenty of money and plenty of work. And I don't know whether they actually know what's going on in places like Margate. I think that they need to come and visit and see for themselves. FRANK ZACCONE: Every one of them in Washington, who are in Washington, are the elites. GONYEA: Do they understand you? F. ZACCONE: No. They have no clue. They have never walked a day in my shoes. C. ZACCONNE: Never. F. ZACCONE: They may come on a tour underground, see, you know, oh, look, they're mining coal. They do - they have - they put the hard hat on, the belt. They don't get a speck of dirt on them. They got their coveralls on. It may - I come out every day as black as that microphone that you have in your hand. GONYEA: That second voice there is Frank Zaccone. He's the 30-year-old coal miner. LANGFITT: And before that, that was, of course, Ali Burke. She's the owner of the Bulls Head. GREENE: God, that's amazing. The different accents, but, I mean, the message and the feeling really very much the same. Did you guys find, I mean, were all the people you guys were talking to supporters of Donald Trump, supporters of Brexit or was it a mix? GONYEA: Mostly you drive around in this part of the state and Trump signs are everywhere. The Zaccones are strong Trump supporters. They say finally they have somebody on their side. Mayor Mavrakis says he's not for Trump or Hillary. He's a Democrat, but he says Trump says the same kinds of things he's been saying for years. GREENE: Frank? LANGFITT: You know, the answer to your question is yes and no. And this is the most fascinating part of the reporting. Almost everybody I talked to voted for Brexit. Not one person could stand Donald Trump. GREENE: Wow. LANGFITT: Even if they shared some of his fears on immigration, they found his political rhetoric just too extreme. Ali, the bar owner, she actually said she wished Michelle Obama was running. GREENE: Interesting. And briefly, guys, just takeaways from this reporting you've done? Frank? LANGFITT: You know, just how widespread this is. Not just in the U. K. , but we've also been seeing this in other parts of Western Europe, in France and in Hungary. You have the president there fighting to keep Muslim refugees out, saying they threaten the country's Christian identity. GREENE: Don? GONYEA: And if they're not really watching Brexit and what's happening in Europe all that closely, one guy told me he says it feels like the whole world is out of balance. You're seeing it in the U. S. You're seeing it elsewhere. And they just feel that the little guy is getting pushed down. GREENE: OK. Well, we're looking at that political trend on two continent with NPR's Don Gonyea and NPR's Frank Langfitt. Thanks, guys. GONYEA: Pleasure. LANGFITT: Happy to do it. GREENE: All right. Election night is coming in this country and we want to hang out with you. All of us here and reporters from stations across the country will be live that night and also the day after, going over results. Listen live and follow the races important to you at npr. org.

A mix of special forces, regular army and police with U. S. support have now battled their way into the eastern neighborhoods of Mosul, aiming to take back the city from the Islamic State. Aid agencies and the U. N. say there may be a million or more people inside Mosul. NPR's Alice Fordham joins us from northern Iraq now. Good morning. ALICE FORDHAM, BYLINE: Good morning, Renee. MONTAGNE: So, you - tell us what you know about the fighting so far today. FORDHAM: Well, commanders on the front tell us that they are still battling ISIS remnants in the little villages just on the edge of the city. But they have pushed past those villages. And they're now in a neighborhood of the east of the city. They took a branch of the state TV yesterday, which was also just on that eastern edge. The fighting just now, they say, is slightly slowed by a dust storm, which is engulfing Mosul and much of northern Iraq, as well as by these continuing ISIS attacks, which - they're happening on the front line. But they're also happening behind the front line. But there's certainly a jubilant mood here. Commanders, officials, people are broadcasting speeches on national television. It's an important moment. MONTAGNE: And Alice, what about those million-plus residents and other civilians inside the city? What do we know about them, including where their sympathies may lay, although I suspect not with ISIS for the most part? FORDHAM: Well, a lot of people here would like to say that. Military commanders are keen to highlight that there are acts of resistance against ISIS inside the city. And they say, you know, we're in touch with groups who say that they'll join the fight against ISIS once the armed forces come into Mosul. But if such groups exist, it's unlikely that they are very strong. It's unlikely that they're heavily armed. They may be - you know, some people bury a few weapons or hide them from ISIS. But they're not going to be a very effective force immediately. And when we speak to people inside Mosul, they say there is still support for ISIS. The people inside Mosul have long been deeply suspicious of the security forces in Iraq. They are mainly Sunni Muslims, who, in 2014, when ISIS took Mosul, they often complained that they were targeted and marginalized by the Shiite-dominated government in Baghdad. And because Mosul has been held by ISIS, it's been very difficult to get information about what's happening inside there. So it's a bit of a black hole. No one's really sure exactly how people are going to respond when the forces move in. MONTAGNE: Right. So, is it actually also a complex - a lot - number of layers here. So, what are you - what's expected in the next few weeks? FORDHAM: Well, this is the big question. We're actually two weeks into this campaign now, a little bit more. This is just one front of Mosul, the eastern front. And actually, people who were fighting on this eastern front did tell me at the beginning that they thought they would be in Mosul in two weeks' time. But then, for what happens inside the city, there are really well-informed people here who think about nothing but the battle inside Mosul. And they all say different things. We know that there are thousands of ISIS fighters there. We know from eyewitnesses that they have built fortifications and defenses. And we know that the progress that has been made so far in this offensive has come at a huge cost. There has been significant casualties in the security forces from dozens of ISIS truck bombs, other complex bombs that ISIS has been able to lay. The villages that I have been through that have been retaken from ISIS were very damaged. So the indications are that this urban fighting will be very tough. But there are people who point out that there are some places that ISIS has basically abandoned, some who speculate they might move from the eastern side of this city, over the rivers to the western side. It might be easier to defend only one side of the city. And although some people speculate hundreds of thousands of people might be displaced or caught in the fighting, that hasn't happened so far. Obviously, it would be a huge relief for civilians if those scenarios didn't materialize. MONTAGNE: A lot ahead here for everyone. Alice, thanks very much. FORDHAM: Thanks for having me.

Turn the dark night of infidels into day. That so far unverified message is the sort of thinking that inspired many of Mosul's residents to flee when ISIS seized the city more than two years ago. Among them, more than 100,000 Christians, including many from the surrounding villages who, centuries ago, were required to pay a tax to remain Christian when the ruling Muslims arrived. One man who is key to Iraq's Chaldean Catholic Church is Bashar Warda, archbishop from the nearby city of Erbil. He spoke to us via Skype as he, too, kept up with the fighting in Mosul. BASHAR WARDA: Yes. Yes, we are following every day the news as well as we are following some of the videos and photographs that being sent from our Christian villages every day from people who are visiting these sites. MONTAGNE: Now that they've been liberated. Is there any image or any moment that struck you? WARDA: I would say that being in a church and raising the cross again it's a momento of victory. And this is a momento that really has strengthened the hope that, yes, this evil will be defeated. MONTAGNE: Would it have been possible for the Christians to have stayed inside the city or even in their villages? Was there any way for them to coexist when ISIS was running things? WARDA: No, it's enslavement. It's enslavement. Some people would say, well, why you don't - did not pay the jizya and that's it? Not the jizya. . . MONTAGNE: That's the tax. That's the tax. WARDA: Yeah. No, the jizya, the taxation, it's not - some people would think wrongly that paying the taxation would save the Christians - not at all. I mean, it's better to be without property but with dignity. It's better to be without a job and house, but still you keep your dignity. So it's about being a Christian and being fully human. MONTAGNE: Could you just give us a small definition? The tax that would have been levied on a Christian who wanted to stay and live under the Islamic state - what would that tax be? WARDA: In the seventh century when the Arabs came, they have this condition - Islam or you could stay in the land of Islam, but you have to pay a jizya, which is taxation, money that we'd be giving every month to the ruler of the area. And this taxation also, jizya, have been widened to include different issues, like, for example, in the eighth or ninth century, it was forbidden for a Christian to build a house higher than the house of a Muslim. It was forbidden for a Christian to ride a horse; he should ride a donkey. It was forbidden for Christians, for example, to walk alongside a Muslim. All these procedures were added to this taxation, and these conditions were left, I think, even in the 14th century, 15th century. None of the people start talking about a jizya anymore because they knew that it's a counterfeit statements. MONTAGNE: So they were bringing it all back in the 21st century? WARDA: Yes, yeah. MONTAGNE: Well, the Christians in Iraq - and especially many of them were in Mosul and in villages around Mosul - they have, though, for centuries, lived peacefully at least with their Muslim neighbors. How much damage has been done to those relationships with the coming of ISIS? WARDA: Yeah - there is now a mistrust, I have to tell you. People are a bit worried about how they are going to go back into Mosul and live with neighbors who betrayed them. There are also some stories of, for example, neighbors who tried to protect the property but they were forbidden by the Islamic State because, you know, each - all of the houses were marked by this letter nun, which it mean Nasrani, Nazareth. MONTAGNE: Meaning Christian. WARDA: Christian houses. But we have to remind and rebuild the whole trust relationship again. I mean, I think that this is one of the tasks upon the church and the churches to do. I would say that our people will be reluctant for us to go outside Mosul before really having been assured that at least there is the basic trust. MONTAGNE: Before the U. S. -led invasion of Iraq in 2003, there were something like 2 to 2. 5 million Christians in Iraq. And there are now fewer than 300,000 - these are rough numbers. You have suggested that the U. S. has a moral responsibility to help those Chaldeans who are left, given that this was a U. S. -led invasion. WARDA: Not suggested - I do believe that the Americans have a moral responsibility concerning Iraq, as a whole country. They have to finish the job. They have to be really - because they promised that they'd come and bring democracy. OK. We have also our own responsibility. I'm not blaming the Americans of all the mess, but the mess is there. I mean, we cannot deny what's happened to the country. I mean, there is a mess, and there are a lot of political divisions, which is affecting the lives of the innocent people, not just the Christians - Christians, Yazidis, Muslims, so Shia, Sunnah, Kurds - everyone has been affected by the whole situation which is happening now in Iraq. So this is the moral responsibility that we say, well, you have to finish the job. You have to act. It's time for actions. MONTAGNE: Bashar Warda is archbishop of Erbil, speaking to us from Erbil in northern Iraq. Thank you so much for joining us. WARDA: Thank you. God bless you all. RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST:  As the battle to take back the Iraqi city of Mosul rages on, the leader of the Islamic State released a dramatic audio message - the war is yours. Turn the dark night of infidels into day. That so far unverified message is the sort of thinking that inspired many of Mosul's residents to flee when ISIS seized the city more than two years ago. Among them, more than 100,000 Christians, including many from the surrounding villages who, centuries ago, were required to pay a tax to remain Christian when the ruling Muslims arrived. One man who is key to Iraq's Chaldean Catholic Church is Bashar Warda, archbishop from the nearby city of Erbil. He spoke to us via Skype as he, too, kept up with the fighting in Mosul. BASHAR WARDA: Yes. Yes, we are following every day the news as well as we are following some of the videos and photographs that being sent from our Christian villages every day from people who are visiting these sites. MONTAGNE: Now that they've been liberated. Is there any image or any moment that struck you? WARDA: I would say that being in a church and raising the cross again it's a momento of victory. And this is a momento that really has strengthened the hope that, yes, this evil will be defeated. MONTAGNE: Would it have been possible for the Christians to have stayed inside the city or even in their villages? Was there any way for them to coexist when ISIS was running things? WARDA: No, it's enslavement. It's enslavement. Some people would say, well, why you don't - did not pay the jizya and that's it? Not the jizya. . . MONTAGNE: That's the tax. That's the tax. WARDA: Yeah. No, the jizya, the taxation, it's not - some people would think wrongly that paying the taxation would save the Christians - not at all. I mean, it's better to be without property but with dignity. It's better to be without a job and house, but still you keep your dignity. So it's about being a Christian and being fully human. MONTAGNE: Could you just give us a small definition? The tax that would have been levied on a Christian who wanted to stay and live under the Islamic state - what would that tax be?

JONATHAN TEPPERMAN: That's a really tough question. If you look at the long-term trend lines, I'd say no because there are so many more democracies on the planet today than there were 20, 30, 40 years ago. RAZ: This is Jonathan Tepperman. He's the managing editor of Foreign Affairs magazine. TEPPERMAN: But, you know, there's the big fact that we see just a spectacular level of dysfunction here in the United States, which is scary because it is seriously tarnishing what is, after all, the greatest model for a successful democracy in the world. RAZ: Right. TEPPERMAN: And you hear - you know, you go to China today, or you go to Russia and you hear a lot of people saying - why should we look at the United States for an example? You guys can't get anything right. RAZ: Right. TEPPERMAN: So democracy is in trouble. Do I think the disease is a fatal one? No. Because there's not really much sign that the appetite for democracy is diminishing. RAZ: So a few years ago, Jonathan decided to see for himself just how big a test democracy is facing and whether some countries around the world are figuring out solutions to those challenges. TEPPERMAN: I logged up about 100,000 frequent flyer miles. Brazil, Mexico - I went to Indonesia, spent some time in South Korea. I went to Canada, although I didn't get a lot of miles for that and I got to stay with my parents when I was there. And I went to Botswana as well. RAZ: OK. So let me ask you about Canada, which is a great example because Canada is, like, a cool country. Right? Like, everyone loves Canada. TEPPERMAN: Isn't it the best? RAZ: You guys are, like, the rock stars of the democratic world. TEPPERMAN: We are, and I'm loving every minute of it. RAZ: Needless to say, Jonathan isn't exactly impartial about Canada. But he went there to look at one major issue, an issue that is totally vexing for a lot of Western democracies but an issue that, in Canada, they seemed to have completely figured out - immigration. Jonathan picks up that idea from the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)TEPPERMAN: Canada, today, is among the world's most welcoming nations, even compared to other immigration-friendly countries. If you ask Canadians what makes them proudest of their country, they rank multiculturalism, a dirty word in most places, second, ahead of hockey. (LAUGHTER)TEPPERMAN: Hockey. In other words, at a time when other countries are now frantically building new barriers to keep foreigners out, Canadians want even more of them in. Canada wasn't always like this. Until the mid-1960s, Canada followed an explicitly racist immigration policy. So how did that Canada become today's Canada? Well, despite what my mom in Ontario will tell you, the answer had nothing to do with virtue. The real explanation involves the man who became Canada's leader in 1968, Pierre Trudeau, who's also the father of the current prime minister. (APPLAUSE)TEPPERMAN: The thing to know about that first Trudeau is that he was a French speaker in a country long-dominated by its English elite. He was an intellectual. He was even kind of groovy. The guy did yoga. He hung out with the Beatles. But he nevertheless pulled off one of the most progressive transformations any country has ever seen. First, Canada threw out its old race-based immigration rules and it replaced them with new colorblind ones that emphasized education, experience and language skills instead. And what that did was greatly increase the odds that newcomers would contribute to the economy. Then Trudeau created the world's first policy of official multiculturalism to promote the idea that diversity was the key to Canada's identity. And these two influences soon combined to create the passionately open-minded Canada of today. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)TEPPERMAN: Immigration in Canada is at an extraordinarily high level today. Canada admitted three times more Syrian refugees in the last year than did the United States. And, by the way, Canada is now really the only country in the developed world which has had no populist backlash against immigration. RAZ: OK, Canada, not bad, right? But what about a bigger and more complicated democracy? Well, another place Jonathan went is a country that often gets overlooked but a country with the fourth-largest population in the world, Indonesia. TEPPERMAN: Indonesia is a very messy place. It's made up of 17,000 islands, people speak close to a thousand languages and is the world's single-biggest Muslim country. And the country's politics are quite shambolic. But for all of that, the country is a pretty decent high-functioning democracy, especially considering the fact that it has managed to conquer the rise of political Islam and Islamic terrorism as well. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)TEPPERMAN: In 1998, the people of Indonesia took to the streets and overthrew their longtime dictator, Suharto. It was an amazing moment, but it was also a scary one. Experts feared that without him keeping a lid on things, the country would explode or religious extremists would take over and turn Indonesia into a tropical version of Iran. Since then, however, Indonesia has taken a surprising turn. While ordinary folks have grown more pious on a personal level, the country's politics have moved in the opposite direction. Indonesia is now a pretty decent democracy. Islamist parties have steadily lost support. As for terrorism, it's now extremely rare. In 2014, I went to Indonesia to ask its current president, a soft-spoken technocrat named Joko Widodo why is Indonesia thriving? Well, what we realized, he told me, is that to deal with extremism, we needed to deal with inequality first. See, Indonesia's religious parties, like similar parties elsewhere, had tended to focus on things like reducing poverty and cutting corruption. So that's what Jokowi and his predecessors did, too, thereby stealing the Islamist thunder. They also cracked down hard on terrorism. But Indonesia's democrats have learned that repression only creates more extremism, so they waged their war with extraordinary delicacy. They used the police instead of the army. They held public trials. They even sent liberal imams into the jails to persuade the jihadists that terror is un-Islamic. And all of this paid off in spectacular fashion, creating the kind of country that was unimaginable 20 years ago. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RAZ: OK, so if a place like Indonesia is figuring out how to handle this - right? - like, the challenges that democracy faces, I'm assuming that you are optimistic about the future of democracy. TEPPERMAN: I am. Number one, there are solutions to all of these big problems. Number two, these solutions tend to come at moments of existential peril, just when things look like they're at their absolute worst. And that's for a really simple reason, which is those moments make people serious about actually doing something and they sweep away a lot of the obstacles that ordinarily block reform. And, you know, the last lesson that I draw is, you know, we shouldn't give up hope because it's not productive and because it's not necessary because as I found time and time again, there are stories of many, many countries who came right to the brink and then not only managed to pull themselves back, but managed to make these fundamental changes that have allowed them to thrive in a way they never have before.

I'm Guy Raz. And on the show today - Democracy on Trial. Ideas about when democracy works and how to improve it, even if it'll never be perfect. YANIS VAROUFAKIS: It's good to strive for it. You never get there. It's a bit like the horizon. RAZ: This is Yanis Varoufakis. VAROUFAKIS: I was an academic all my life, teaching mathematical economics and political economy. I was Minister of Finance in Greece. RAZ: So should I call you Mr. Minister? VAROUFAKIS: I insist you call me Yanis. RAZ: OK, great. Just out of curiosity, has there ever been a functioning democracy in your view that worked well? VAROUFAKIS: No, there hasn't. But that doesn't mean that democracy is not a powerful weapon against tyranny. RAZ: A strong democracy, Yanis says, is just much better equipped to handle crisis than, say, a dictatorship is. And a couple of years ago he was at the center of a crisis. It was in Greece. The country was basically bankrupt. And Yanis had to negotiate paying Greece's debts to the European Union. VAROUFAKIS: People asked me, what was the worst part of the negotiations? Well, the worst part of the negotiations is that there were no negotiations. I was negotiating for the right to negotiate. RAZ: Yanis, like the Greek people, had very little say in what actually happened to his country, which ultimately was forced to accept a huge austerity plan. And the outcome made a lot of people in Greece and in Europe feel like democracy wasn't exactly living up to its promise. VAROUFAKIS: Liberal democracy is the child, if you want, of the Magna Carta. RAZ: Yeah. VAROUFAKIS: And later on the Federalist Papers. The whole point was to have legitimacy of an oligarchic structure. The idea was to keep the riffraff, to keep the hoi polloi out of power, but to consult with them and to have their representatives speak on their behalf in a Congress, in a parliament in order to create checks and balances. But it was never about empowering them with the right to govern. So the problem is that we haven't had democracy for quite a while, if ever. RAZ: Yanis argues that in an authentic democracy, the power has to sit with the demos - with the people. But today in most western democracies, he says, power is tied to money. Here's Yanis on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)VAROUFAKIS: In the West, we mistakenly believe that capitalism begets inevitably democracy. It doesn't. Allow me to point out an interesting paradox that is threatening our economies as we speak. I call it the twin peaks paradox. One peak is the mountain of debts that is - has been casting a long shadow over the United States, Europe, the whole world. But few people discern its twin, mountain of idle cash belonging to rich savers and the corporations, too terrified to invest it into the productive activities that can generate the incomes from which you can extinguish the mountain of debts. The result is stagnant wages and consequently low aggregate demand, which in a never-ending cycle reinforces the pessimism of the investors. This is my quarrel with capitalism, its gross wastefulness. The more capitalism succeeds in taking the demos out of democracy, the greater the waste of humanity's wealth. RAZ: So essentially what you're saying is that the notion of power residing in the people in a democracy is a smokescreen and that a capitalist system ultimately means that power will reside in the hands of corporations? VAROUFAKIS: Well, you just stated it. And there's nothing - I need to answer this. Isn't it so? Is there anyone who disagrees? The idea of, you know, people power because that's what democracy means. The demos is the people. It is the regime of the people by the people for the people. This is a wonderful, a splendid notion. It is something to aspire to and something to struggle for. But it's not a reality. The reality is there is a huge tension between capitalism and democracy. And this is the point I was making in my TED Talk. RAZ: So democracy and capitalism are not compatible in your view? VAROUFAKIS: There is a great deal of incompatibility that is baked into capitalism. Think about it. In political science departments throughout the United States - but everywhere else as well - professors like to compare and contrast two different kinds of voting systems. One is the one-person, one-vote that you have in general elections like the one in November now for the president of the United States. But there's another voting mechanism called the market. When you go to the supermarket, to a store and you purchase an iPhone or a bottle of fizzy water, you are voting for it. Except that you don't have one vote, you have as many votes as you have money. If you go to a shareholders meeting for any corporation, you'll find that there is voting. Except that it's not one-person, one-vote. So in capitalism the whole point about profit maximization is all about monopoly power. There is a quest for monopoly, which is exactly the opposite of what democracy's all about. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)VAROUFAKIS: Have you wondered why politicians are not what they used to be? It's not because their DNA has degenerated. (LAUGHTER)VAROUFAKIS: It is rather because one can be in government today and not in power because power has migrated from the political to the economic sphere which is separate. Earlier this year, while I was representing Greece, the newly elected Greek government in the eurogroup as its finance minister, I was told in no uncertain terms that our nation's democratic process - our elections - could not be allowed to interfere with economic policies that were being implemented in Greece. At that moment, I felt that there could be no greater vindication of some recalcitrant friends of mine who kept telling me that democracy would be banned if it ever threatened to change anything. In our democracies today, this separation of economic from the political sphere, the moment it started happening, it gave rise to an inexorable epic struggle between the two with the economic sphere colonizing the political sphere to such an extent that it is undermining itself causing economic crisis. RAZ: It seems like when you talk about capitalism undermining itself, I wonder whether the very same market forces that produced the inequality you talk about, you know, could also in theory produce the kind of democracy that you're looking for. VAROUFAKIS: That has always been my mindset, my way of thinking about history. History, as far as I'm concerned, is what happens when two forces clash - one is technological innovation which constantly destabilizes the existing order, and the second force is the social relations of production and the power relations production. And the result of this clash between the power relations generates history, but that, of course, I didn't invent this historical theory. This is Karl Marx. But think about it. Capitalism burst upon the scene historically in the 18th century in England, so we must never imagine that capitalism is a natural system of doing things. It is just one phase of human development. It will certainly pass. My great worry is what happens after capitalism? Capitalism is undermining itself magnificently with technologies which it is producing. Now we're going to have a multitude of machines capable of becoming our slaves, but at the same time capable of enslaving us. What we do with this magnificent technology - and don't get me wrong I'm completely gung ho about technology. I think that it is the greatest weapon against misery - but what do we do with this technology? It will depend on politics, and it better be democratic politics that determines our future. RAZ: What would an ideal democracy look like, one that you had a hand in in creating or one that you at least could influence? What would that democracy be like? VAROUFAKIS: So imagine a world in which our political rights and our economic rights were in sync. They're not in sync at the moment. Imagine that you worked in a corporation where the only people who had the right to be shareholders of a corporation is those who worked in it. But, you know, the kind of model that I'm describing to you is not just buying this kite. It exists. I know companies in the United States that operate on those lines. RAZ: Yeah. Profit sharing. Yeah, right. VAROUFAKIS: Profit sharing - this is a market system what I am describing, by the way, except that the rules are different. The whole point about democracy is that we have a capacity to control our lives on the basis of one person, one vote. If corporate power can shape our lives, can destroy our lives or in the case of a very small minority it can make us supremely rich, but that corporate power is not subject to democratic checks and balances then effectively what I am proposing a surge of democracy. Either we are going to democratize our societies and civilize our civilization or our societies are going to come tumbling down. RAZ: What are you optimistic about when it comes to democracy? Anything? VAROUFAKIS: I'm optimistic that the idea of democracy is consistent with the better side of humans and that it will always resonate with them. Democracy is the kind of regime that people who don't think they have all the answers favor. Those who believe that they know best and they know everything, they obviously don't like the idea of democracy because it's a constraint. But those of us who believe that none of us have the answers and the only way of finding the answers to the interesting questions about social life is to get together, we appreciate the possibility that democracy gives us. RAZ: Yanis Varoufakis is an economist and the former Greek finance minister. You can see his entire talk at ted. com. GUY RAZ, HOST:  It's the TED Radio Hour from NPR. I'm Guy Raz. And on the show today - Democracy on Trial. Ideas about when democracy works and how to improve it, even if it'll never be perfect. YANIS VAROUFAKIS: It's good to strive for it. You never get there. It's a bit like the horizon. RAZ: This is Yanis Varoufakis. VAROUFAKIS: I was an academic all my life, teaching mathematical economics and political economy. I was Minister of Finance in Greece. RAZ: So should I call you Mr. Minister? VAROUFAKIS: I insist you call me Yanis. RAZ: OK, great. Just out of curiosity, has there ever been a functioning democracy in your view that worked well? VAROUFAKIS: No, there hasn't. But that doesn't mean that democracy is not a powerful weapon against tyranny. RAZ: A strong democracy, Yanis says, is just much better equipped to handle crisis than, say, a dictatorship is. And a couple of years ago he was at the center of a crisis. It was in Greece. The country was basically bankrupt. And Yanis had to negotiate paying Greece's debts to the European Union. VAROUFAKIS: People asked me, what was the worst part of the negotiations? Well, the worst part of the negotiations is that there were no negotiations. I was negotiating for the right to negotiate. RAZ: Yanis, like the Greek people, had very little say in what actually happened to his country, which ultimately was forced to accept a huge austerity plan. And the outcome made a lot of people in Greece and in Europe feel like democracy wasn't exactly living up to its promise. VAROUFAKIS: Liberal democracy is the child, if you want, of the Magna Carta. RAZ: Yeah. VAROUFAKIS: And later on the Federalist Papers. The whole point was to have legitimacy of an oligarchic structure. The idea was to keep the riffraff, to keep the hoi polloi out of power, but to consult with them and to have their representatives speak on their behalf in a Congress, in a parliament in order to create checks and balances. But it was never about empowering them with the right to govern. So the problem is that we haven't had democracy for quite a while, if ever. RAZ: Yanis argues that in an authentic democracy, the power has to sit with the demos - with the people. But today in most western democracies, he says, power is tied to money. Here's Yanis on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) VAROUFAKIS: In the West, we mistakenly believe that capitalism begets inevitably democracy. It doesn't. Allow me to point out an interesting paradox that is threatening our economies as we speak. I call it the twin peaks paradox. One peak is the mountain of debts that is - has been casting a long shadow over the United States, Europe, the whole world. But few people discern its twin, mountain of idle cash belonging to rich savers and the corporations, too terrified to invest it into the productive activities that can generate the incomes from which you can extinguish the mountain of debts. The result is stagnant wages and consequently low aggregate demand, which in a never-ending cycle reinforces the pessimism of the investors. This is my quarrel with capitalism, its gross wastefulness. The more capitalism succeeds in taking the demos out of democracy, the greater the waste of humanity's wealth. RAZ: So essentially what you're saying is that the notion of power residing in the people in a democracy is a smokescreen and that a capitalist system ultimately means that power will reside in the hands of corporations? VAROUFAKIS: Well, you just stated it. And there's nothing - I need to answer this. Isn't it so? Is there anyone who disagrees? The idea of, you know, people power because that's what democracy means. The demos is the people. It is the regime of the people by the people for the people. This is a wonderful, a splendid notion. It is something to aspire to and something to struggle for. But it's not a reality. The reality is there is a huge tension between capitalism and democracy. And this is the point I was making in my TED Talk. RAZ: So democracy and capitalism are not compatible in your view? VAROUFAKIS: There is a great deal of incompatibility that is baked into capitalism. Think about it. In political science departments throughout the United States - but everywhere else as well - professors like to compare and contrast two different kinds of voting systems. One is the one-person, one-vote that you have in general elections like the one in November now for the president of the United States. But there's another voting mechanism called the market. When you go to the supermarket, to a store and you purchase an iPhone or a bottle of fizzy water, you are voting for it. Except that you don't have one vote, you have as many votes as you have money. If you go to a shareholders meeting for any corporation, you'll find that there is voting. Except that it's not one-person, one-vote. So in capitalism the whole point about profit maximization is all about monopoly power. There is a quest for monopoly, which is exactly the opposite of what democracy's all about. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) VAROUFAKIS: Have you wondered why politicians are not what they used to be? It's not because their DNA has degenerated. (LAUGHTER) VAROUFAKIS: It is rather because one can be in government today and not in power because power has migrated from the political to the economic sphere which is separate. Earlier this year, while I was representing Greece, the newly elected Greek government in the eurogroup as its finance minister, I was told in no uncertain terms that our nation's democratic process - our elections - could not be allowed to interfere with economic policies that were being implemented in Greece. At that moment, I felt that there could be no greater vindication of some recalcitrant friends of mine who kept telling me that democracy would be banned if it ever threatened to change anything. In our democracies today, this separation of economic from the political sphere, the moment it started happening, it gave rise to an inexorable epic struggle between the two with the economic sphere colonizing the political sphere to such an extent that it is undermining itself causing economic crisis.

S. forces in Iraq. Do you assume that the worst is to come simply because a densely populated urban area is a very difficult place to fight? GARY VOLESKY: I think that's part of it. ISIL's been there for two years. And so they've developed some pretty complex obstacles and done a lot of preparation. And so, you know, we expect the fight will be harder the closer we get into the inner parts of the city. Encouragingly, though, the Iraqis have gone much faster than I'd - than we had anticipated. But we expect the fight will be - I expect it'll be a little more difficult the closer they get inside of Mosul. INSKEEP: You said that Iraqi forces are moving faster than you anticipated? VOLESKY: Yeah. And I'll give you an example. You know, there was a town called Shirqat. We thought that that would take probably a week to 10 days. And they cleared it in three. And so that's just an example of how fast they've gone. And, you know, we're enabling that with a lot of strikes, you know, both by the air and by ground. But, you know, they're the ones fighting the enemy at the tip of the spear, if you will. INSKEEP: If the Iraqi forces are moving faster than expected, I'm trying to think what that might tell us about ISIS. One possibility that occurs to me is that they're pretty weak. Another is that they're strategically retreating to someplace they think they can better defend. Any idea which it is? VOLESKY: Well, you know, I think both. I don't think you can classify the enemy right now as one big element that's got one overarching plan. I think that there are those pockets that are coming back and going to defend and have that plan. I think others are just moving to try to get out of the way and survive and preserve their force. INSKEEP: Is there a risk that you could capture Mosul and really not reduce the level of violence in Iraq very much? VOLESKY: We're seeing the enemy trying to transition to some insurgency and terrorism. And you've heard about the attacks in Baghdad, these high profile attacks. . . INSKEEP: Yeah. VOLESKY: . . . Vehicle-borne IEDS. So we fully expect they're going to attempt to, you know, evolve or devolve, if you will, into an insurgency and a real terrorist-based model. INSKEEP: I want to make sure that people listening to us follow what we're saying. You're telling me you have signs that ISIS recognizes they may lose a lot of territory. And they're preparing to give up on trying to govern territory and transition to just blowing things up and causing disruptions. VOLESKY: Well, I wouldn't say it that dramatically. I would say - you heard Baghdadi two months ago when he clearly, in my opinion, recognized they were losing - said that, you know, taking over villages and cities isn't going to be the end of ISIL. We'll go back out into the deserts where we've come from, like we did before. And then we'll wait, bide our time and come back. So we expect that as they lose more terrain, they'll try to get into Baghdad and do more of these high-profile attacks to take people's attention off the losses that they're suffering and try to make the - you know, the ISIL brand still relevant. INSKEEP: Could that deflection increase the risk of attacks on the United States itself? VOLESKY: I mean, you've seen the incidents in Paris and Brussels and the United States. I mean, they've come out and said they want to take the fight outside of the borders and into borders like our country. So I would expect them to try to do something just to take attention off.

I'm Scott Simon. Iraqi forces and their allies continue their attempt to retake the city of Mosul from ISIS. Progress has been slow, but their advance is ongoing. We're joined now by Seth Jones. He's director of the International Security and Defense Policy Center at the RAND Corporation. He also served as an advisor with the commanding general of U. S. special operations forces in Afghanistan. Mr. Jones, thanks so much for being with us. SETH JONES: Thanks for having me on, Scott. SIMON: You argue that ISIS might lose the battle, but still wind up closer toward winning the war. JONES: Well, I think the issue here is to understand that groups like ISIS wax and wane over time. Just because they're weakening now and they're losing territory doesn't mean that this trend will continue. I think there are a range of factors that may increase their probability of coming back, and I think that's what I've argued. SIMON: Give us some historical context, if you could. You argue that, historically, insurgencies have often succeeded when they keep what amounts to - forgive this cliche - a light footprint. JONES: Right. So there are a couple of factors that if ISIS decides to learn - effectively learn - some of the lessons from successful insurgent groups, they'll do at least three things. One is that they will look for sanctuary - we've already seen them doing that in the Jazira areas along the Iraqi-Syrian border - where they'll refit, train and then wait for future operations. A second is a switch to a guerrilla campaign. That is, they're facing a much more powerful enemy right now - The Iraqi security forces, Shia militias, Sunni Arab forces, Kurdish Peshmerga backed by American and other special operations and air power. It makes very little sense for them at this point to conduct conventional campaigns, to take these kinds of forces on the battlefield, which means the tried and traditional method is guerrilla war. It's ambushes and raids. It's no set piece battles. And so that's the second issue that we look for. Third is to try to take advantage, over time, of grievances. There are plenty of them, both on the Iraqi and Syrian side, none of which have been effectively dealt with at this point. So those three things - I think, if they focused on them, they might be able to regain some of that territory. SIMON: Has the Iraqi government therefore made a strategic mistake by investing so much firepower and so much prestige in retaking Mosul? JONES: No. The Iraqi government, I don't think, has made a mistake in focusing so much of an effort, but what becomes very important is less the issue of taking Mosul and more what happens afterwards. Which of the state and non-state actors seize the territory? How effective is the Iraqi government in getting water back running, electricity back running, the delivery of services? These will become very important issues because if we see Kurdish forces into Sunni areas controlling territory, we see Shia - the popular mobilization Shia forces - controlling territory in Mosul itself, if we see poor governance with the Iraqi politicians that come in and take over areas that have been vacated by ISIS - these are all variables that may increase animosity among the local population. SIMON: What would you like to see the next president of the United States do? JONES: I'd like the next U. S. president to focus, in part, on taking territory away, but, even more important, to understand that wars in places like Iraq and Syria are first political and second military. So if you're going to make a decision to try to take territory away from a group like ISIS, then you've got to deal with some of the grievances that are underlying the whole conflict because if you don't deal with those, you will be right back where we started in 2018 or 2017. That lesson should have been learned in 2011, and it wasn't. SIMON: Seth Jones is director of the International Security and Defense Policy Center at the RAND Corporation.

This was a migrant camp in Calais, France, and the last stopping point for migrants and refugees before they tried to enter the United Kingdom, often hiding in trucks or containers bound for Britain. Now those refugees are being sent to centers across France to process them for asylum or deportation. There are roughly 1,600 unaccompanied minors and children that need to be relocated. Dr. Nick Maurice is a retired physician from Wiltshire in the U. K. He has spent time in that camp, the Jungle, and has met some of these children. He joins us now from the studios of the BBC. Thank you so much for being with us. NICK MAURICE: It's a great pleasure. MARTIN: I understand you were at the camp a little under a month ago. What was it like? MAURICE: I have to say it was a desperate, desperate situation - people living in just appalling conditions, maybe be under a piece of plastic with four poles stuck in the ground - no electricity, Portaloos in the most awful condition and so on. And, you know, we had to keep reminding ourselves that these are people who have fled the most terrible conditions in their countries of origin, have undertaken extraordinarily perilous journeys to get to Calais in the first place and find themselves living in these appalling conditions in that camp. MARTIN: So was it, then, a good thing that this camp has been closed down, if the conditions were so horrific? MAURICE: No, it was not a good thing because there was a sense of community in the camp. And many people had been there for as long as a year, attempting to get to the U. K. almost on a daily basis. But now they have been dispersed, as it were, to these 160 so-called CAOs, centres d'accueil et d'orientation - centers of welcome and orientation - dotted all over France. And I have no doubt that many of them will drift back to the north of France in order to continue their attempts to get to the U. K. MARTIN: It's my understanding that the U. K. has decided to allow some of the children to make their way to the U. K. So far, 300 of these children have been allowed in. And a Home Office spokesman told NPR that they do intend to accept several hundred more who qualify. Do you understand what criteria they use? Why take one child and not another? MAURICE: I don't. I don't understand that, and I'm not even sure that the Home Office understands that, frankly. Quite what the process is that they will go through, I really don't know. MARTIN: You're a doctor. What are the health conditions of some of the people, patients, you were tending to in the camp? MAURICE: The sorts of things that I was seeing were largely minor injuries sustained from falling off the backs of trucks. I saw a number of people with injuries, really, as a result of having walked from the south of Italy to Calais over the Alps. I saw people, for example, with swollen knees, people with upper respiratory infections and that kind of thing. I saw very few, frankly, serious conditions. And those that I did see, I was able to pass on to Medecins Sans Frontieres or to the hospital in Calais if I felt that they needed urgent treatment. MARTIN: I imagine you heard a lot of stories from those refugees. Is there one that stays with you? MAURICE: There is one in particular. A boy age 12 - his voice hadn't broken - called Ahmed, he came into my caravan. And through an interpreter, I questioned Ahmed about his story. I said, Ahmed, why did you come to Calais? He said, my father came to Calais and managed to climb onto a truck and got to London. He worked in London for four years, then the police caught him. They deported him back to Afghanistan. The moment he arrived in Afghanistan, the Taliban shot and killed him. My uncle came and said it was not safe for me to remain in Afghanistan. He sold some land. He took me to the border with Iran. He handed me over to some men who brought me to Calais. Ahmed, who have you left behind in Afghanistan? I've left my mother and my three sisters. Do you ever cry? No, my crying has stopped. Ahmed, age 12, was telling me this story. MARTIN: Dr. Nick Maurice is a retired physician who was working at the Calais migrant camp. It's now been dismantled in France. Dr. Maurice, thanks so much for your time. MAURICE: It's a pleasure. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:  This past week, French authorities finally closed the Jungle. This was a migrant camp in Calais, France, and the last stopping point for migrants and refugees before they tried to enter the United Kingdom, often hiding in trucks or containers bound for Britain. Now those refugees are being sent to centers across France to process them for asylum or deportation. There are roughly 1,600 unaccompanied minors and children that need to be relocated. Dr. Nick Maurice is a retired physician from Wiltshire in the U. K. He has spent time in that camp, the Jungle, and has met some of these children. He joins us now from the studios of the BBC. Thank you so much for being with us. NICK MAURICE: It's a great pleasure. MARTIN: I understand you were at the camp a little under a month ago. What was it like? MAURICE: I have to say it was a desperate, desperate situation - people living in just appalling conditions, maybe be under a piece of plastic with four poles stuck in the ground - no electricity, Portaloos in the most awful condition and so on. And, you know, we had to keep reminding ourselves that these are people who have fled the most terrible conditions in their countries of origin, have undertaken extraordinarily perilous journeys to get to Calais in the first place and find themselves living in these appalling conditions in that camp. MARTIN: So was it, then, a good thing that this camp has been closed down, if the conditions were so horrific? MAURICE: No, it was not a good thing because there was a sense of community in the camp. And many people had been there for as long as a year, attempting to get to the U. K. almost on a daily basis. But now they have been dispersed, as it were, to these 160 so-called CAOs, centres d'accueil et d'orientation - centers of welcome and orientation - dotted all over France. And I have no doubt that many of them will drift back to the north of France in order to continue their attempts to get to the U. K. MARTIN: It's my understanding that the U.

They're handing out mattresses and blankets to thousands of people every day. Many have crossed frontlines under fire to get here. I speak with recent arrival Mohammad al Daoudi, who lived more than two years under ISIS in a village on the outskirts of the city. MOHAMMAD AL DAOUDI: (Through interpreter) ISIS fighters came and tried to make us go into Mosul. FORDHAM: It was last week that Daoudi says he and other families were forced into their cars. ISIS wanted to use them as human shields. But when the fighters went to round up the rest of the village, he and about 150 families made a run for it. ISIS fired after them. AL DAOUDI: (Through interpreter) They attacked us very hard. One of us was injured, and we had to leave him behind. We have one, here, in the camp, who was injured by mortars also. FORDHAM: About half the people in his village got away. The others, including his brother and sister, are now on the front line. He weeps as he talks about it. AL DAOUDI: (Through interpreter) The only thing we want is that they get out safe. That's all. FORDHAM: In a tent nearby, several women are recovering from their journey.

When I was in Kandahar a few years ago, I spotted a poster of her image in a coffeehouse there. DAVID GREENE, HOST: The girl in that photo is now a woman who had fled Afghanistan all those years ago and now may be deported to her homeland. STEVE MCCURRY: Sharbat Gula is beloved by all Afghans. She's become a symbol of not only of Afghan refugees but also of Afghanistan itself. GREENE: The voice there is Steve McCurry, whose arresting image of Sharbat Gula in a refugee camp in Pakistan appeared on the cover of National Geographic magazine back in 1985. MCCURRY: Her life has been tragic from the beginning. She lost her parents in a bombing in her village, so she was an orphan. She fled to Pakistan as a refugee. She's lived in this refugee camp for some years. MONTAGNE: Sharbat Gula, now in her 40s, was recently arrested in Pakistan's northwestern city of Peshawar. Her crime - carrying fake identity papers. She pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 15 days in jail and fined 110,000 rupees. That's just over a thousand dollars - a lot of money in that place. On Friday, a judge ordered her to be deported to Afghanistan, but there are reports that Pakistan may be walking back that decision. MCCURRY: Pakistan perhaps feels a little embarrassed to treat this woman in this sort of disrespectful way, considering her circumstances. GREENE: Gula suffers from Hepatitis C. She lost her husband and daughter to that same disease. Since news has spread about her situation, there has been an international outcry to ensure her safety. McCurry says he is doing everything he can to help her. He has never forgotten the first time he met her in a refugee camp outside Peshawar, Pakistan. MCCURRY: Her shawl was ripped. She had a bit of dirt on her face, but she had this kind of glow and this is beauty and just a bit of a haunted quality to her stare. MONTAGNE: McCurry says he's heard that if Gula does return to her homeland, the president of Afghanistan has said he will present her with keys to a house in Kabul. But. . . MCCURRY: Her area, her region has been kind of overrun with Taliban and ISIS militants, so it's - it's a bit dangerous for her to go back to her village.

Now we're going to hear about reaction to his election in different parts of the world. We're joined by NPR international correspondents Carrie Kahn in Mexico City, Frank Langfitt in London and Peter Kenyon in Istanbul. And Carrie, I want to start with you first because one of the central issues of Trump's campaign was his promise to build a wall along the U. S. -Mexico border, make Mexico pay for it. What's been the reaction there? CARRIE KAHN, BYLINE: I think like many around the world, shock is the most resounding reaction. You see that word in newspaper headlines. And when you talk to Mexicans on the street, Trump is very unpopular here. And much of his ire at his rallies and his campaign were directed to Mexico. And there's a lot of concern over the economy, and the overnight plunge of the peso didn't delay those fears at all. It dropped nearly 10 percent. That's the biggest one-day fall in more than two decades. And that prompted Mexico's finance minister and the head of the central bank to come out early this morning and tell reporters about the strength and the fundamentals Mexico has going for it, including large dollar reserves and international lines of credit. You know, some economists are also urging caution too. They say it will be difficult for President-elect Trump to enact some of his most drastic proposals, including the repeal of the North American Trade Agreement, which is now more than two decades old and without doing damage to both economies that trade nearly a billion and a half dollars every day. CORNISH: But to follow that up, is there any sense of how Mexico's government could work with the Trump administration? KAHN: President Pena Nieto this afternoon gave a short message to the nation. He said he spoke personally with President-elect Donald Trump to congratulate him and said that he hoped the two could meet during the transition period and discuss the binational relationship. He also added that it is his job to defend the rights of Mexicans living in Mexico and the United States, and he's looking forward to a prosperous and friendly relationship with the United States. CORNISH: Now, Frank Langfitt, I want to talk to you about U. S. relations with Europe because Donald Trump has questioned U. S. support for NATO, for example, saying maybe the U. S. should only help those nations that would reimburse the country for the costs of protecting them. How is Europe reacting to Trump's election? FRANK LANGFITT, BYLINE: Well, Audie, I think there are a couple of views here. One is there's a certain skepticism that maybe a fair bit of his talk about NATO is campaign bluster and that over time, like past U. S. presidents, he'll come around to being supportive. But I was also talking to a security analyst today in London, and there is a bigger fear in part because obviously in Europe, they've never seen a president like this before. He has practically no background in foreign affairs, and the concern is that he won't go along with the U. S. traditionally shouldering a big chunk of the military burden in NATO. And this could feed a perception that Washington sort of no longer cares about this strategic alliance in Europe, and the fear there would be this - would play into the hands of Vladimir Putin and Russia and that Trump might see, like, the NATO deal kind of like a real estate deal where he's willing to sort of be very transactional and perhaps even carve up the region into spheres of influence, which is kind of what Putin would like. CORNISH: Donald Trump also supported the British exit from the European Union known as Brexit, and he's been largely anti-free trade. What could this mean for the trading relationship between, say, the U. K. and the U. S. ? LANGFITT: Well, there's a little more optimism here. You know, this is a very strong historical relationship between the two countries. And also, before the Brexit vote, Trump said he actually wanted to do a free trade agreement with the U. K. , and the U. K. would, quote, \"be treated fantastically. \"Now, what that means - of course there were no policy details. But if that comes along, that's actually certainly a better deal than the U. K. was getting from President Obama before Brexit. Obama was very much against the U. K. leaving the EU, and he said that the U. K. would actually have to go to the back of the queue if it wanted a bilateral free trade agreement with the United States. CORNISH: Finally, Peter Kenyon watching reaction in the Middle East from Istanbul - Donald Trump has questioned U. S. involvement in Syria. And what are leaders in the region saying today? PETER KENYON, BYLINE: Well, leaders are congratulating him, Audie, but there's a lot of questions. I mean Trump's win would seem, for instance, to be good news for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Trump never declared Assad must go. He says he wants to get along with Russia, Syria's most powerful ally. Opposition rebels, though, are not rejecting Trump out of hand. Some are calling for a new U. S. leadership in Syria, a reflection of dissatisfaction with Obama's policies. Others wonder if Trump really can work with Vladimir Putin of Russia maybe on finding a way to avoid civilian bloodshed in Aleppo. Now, of course Trump doesn't even take office till January, but you can see those watching the death toll mount and mount in Syria are just grasping at whatever they think might make a difference. CORNISH: Another major issue - the U. S. nuclear deal signed last year with Iran. Trump had already threatened to withdraw from it should he be elected. Does this effectively kill that deal? KENYON: Well, that's not clear yet, but certainly Iran's attention has been awoken. Many people were still dealing with the initial shock of the victory when Iran's foreign minister rushed out with a response, calling on Trump, please remain committed to the nuclear deal. On the campaign trail, candidate Trump called it the worst deal ever negotiated, but then he also said he might not just tear it up - or you know, this is a multi-party deal. It's got the blessing of the U. N. Security Council. What he could do - opt for very tough enforcement measures which analysts say would likely cause Tehran to walk away from it. Whatever happens to the deal inside Iran, Trump's rise is being seen as a blow to Hassan Rouhani, Iran's pragmatic president and as red meat for Iran's hard-liners. They're the ones who are already saying this is the real face of America, referring to Trump's behavior on the campaign trail. And with President Rouhani up for re-election next year, hard-liners are really looking to replace him. CORNISH: That's NPR's Peter Kenyon in Istanbul. Thanks so much, Peter. KENYON: You're welcome. CORNISH: We also heard from Frank Langfitt in London. And Carrie Kahn in Mexico. Thank you both. KAHN: You're welcome. LANGFITT: Happy to do it, Audie.

K. leaving the EU, and he said that the U. K. would actually have to go to the back of the queue if it wanted a bilateral free trade agreement with the United States. CORNISH: Finally, Peter Kenyon watching reaction in the Middle East from Istanbul - Donald Trump has questioned U. S. involvement in Syria. And what are leaders in the region saying today? PETER KENYON, BYLINE: Well, leaders are congratulating him, Audie, but there's a lot of questions. I mean Trump's win would seem, for instance, to be good news for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Trump never declared Assad must go. He says he wants to get along with Russia, Syria's most powerful ally. Opposition rebels, though, are not rejecting Trump out of hand. Some are calling for a new U. S. leadership in Syria, a reflection of dissatisfaction with Obama's policies. Others wonder if Trump really can work with Vladimir Putin of Russia maybe on finding a way to avoid civilian bloodshed in Aleppo. Now, of course Trump doesn't even take office till January, but you can see those watching the death toll mount and mount in Syria are just grasping at whatever they think might make a difference. CORNISH: Another major issue - the U. S. nuclear deal signed last year with Iran. Trump had already threatened to withdraw from it should he be elected. Does this effectively kill that deal? KENYON: Well, that's not clear yet, but certainly Iran's attention has been awoken. Many people were still dealing with the initial shock of the victory when Iran's foreign minister rushed out with a response, calling on Trump, please remain committed to the nuclear deal. On the campaign trail, candidate Trump called it the worst deal ever negotiated, but then he also said he might not just tear it up - or you know, this is a multi-party deal. It's got the blessing of the U. N. Security Council. What he could do - opt for very tough enforcement measures which analysts say would likely cause Tehran to walk away from it. Whatever happens to the deal inside Iran, Trump's rise is being seen as a blow to Hassan Rouhani, Iran's pragmatic president and as red meat for Iran's hard-liners. They're the ones who are already saying this is the real face of America, referring to Trump's behavior on the campaign trail. And with President Rouhani up for re-election next year, hard-liners are really looking to replace him. CORNISH: That's NPR's Peter Kenyon in Istanbul. Thanks so much, Peter. KENYON: You're welcome. CORNISH: We also heard from Frank Langfitt in London. And Carrie Kahn in Mexico. Thank you both. KAHN: You're welcome.

And as many of you listeners know, this is my last week hosting MORNING EDITION. DAVID GREENE, HOST: And, Renee, we are going to miss you on the show. And we've been listening to some of the great stories that you've told over the years, which has been wonderful. And I'm just - I'm ready to hear from Afghanistan because I know that's a country that means so much to you. MONTAGNE: We have one of my favorite stories from Afghanistan, a touching story of schoolgirls down in Kandahar. And, of course, I started going to Afghanistan soon after the Taliban government was driven out, back in 2001. It was a peaceful time. And it was filled with hope. And amazingly, in a way, hope continued even after the Taliban came back. When I went to Kandahar for this particular story in 2010, the place had grown so dangerous that the Taliban had taken to targeting even school girls, throwing acid in their faces - terrible, terrible story. GREENE: That's just awful. MONTAGNE: So on this trip, for the first time, I had to wear a burka just to visit a group of girls who, as it turned out, were unafraid. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)MONTAGNE: Follow me now down a street in Kandahar, through a tall iron gate, past a guard with a gun and into a courtyard. Here, little girls let their bright veils slip, and young women throw off their burkas. They're laughing and chatting now that they're within the walls of a place that promises to set them free. UNIDENTIFIED STUDENTS: I love my school. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: I like my school. (Speaking foreign language) I love my. . . UNIDENTIFIED STUDENTS: I love my school. MONTAGNE: Eleven-year-old Bilqis slipped away from her English class. Pretty in a ponytail and red sweater threaded with silver, she wanted to tell us why for her, learning is more precious than any possession. BILQIS: It's very great that everybody HAS to be educated because education is like a gold. When you get it, it will be always in your mind. And you can profit from that. Never - no one can steal it from your mind, education. We can do everything by education. It will shine your life. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)MONTAGNE: It would be fair to say that there's no world of girls more hidden, literally, than the world beneath the burkas of Afghanistan. In Kandahar, these voluminous coverings are often light brown, so on the street, they can appear like dust swirling in an autumn wind. But it would be a mistake to presume that all the women underneath are somehow pitiable or frightened or even meek. They aren't, mostly. And here at the Afghan Canadian Community Center is an especially determined bunch. The center offers courses in English and computer technology and business. The students aren't here just for the joy of learning. They want careers. Here's Bilqis' friend Nurzia, who's 14. NURZIA: I'm learning English because it's an international language. And English is very important for our life if we become a doctor because doctor needs to write prescriptions for the patient by English. MONTAGNE: Do you want to be a doctor, then? NURZIA: Yes. Yes, miss. BILQIS: Yeah, we need more female doctors because Afghans, their womans, they hide their face or then they don't want a male doctor exactly. They want to be treated by female doctors. Therefore, we need for female doctors. MONTAGNE: Yes, Kandahar is the heartland of the Taliban. But as you can hear, these girls have plans to be out in the world. TAHIRA SADISAIDI: My name is Tahira Sadisaidi (ph). SHAHIRA SADISAIDI: Shahira Sadisaidi (ph). We are sisters. And also, we are classmates. MONTAGNE: We found Tahira, who's 20, and Shahira, who's 19, sitting at computers along with a dozen other girls. Tahira's dark eyes shine beneath her gauzy, pink veil. Her sister, Shahira, is the conservative one, all in black. And when they speak of making up for the years under the Taliban when they weren't allowed to go to school, their words tumble out. S SADISAIDI: There was Taliban, so we were not going to school. We were just at home. My father is a doctor. He was teaching us. MONTAGNE: So you're pretty motivated. T SADISAIDI: Yeah. My father and my aunties, especially my mother - she's a housewife, but she really motivated us. Everything which we are studying because of my mother or my father. My mother didn't study because her family was just a little bit conservative. They didn't like schools. My mother said, no, my daughter will be a teacher or will maybe be a doctor - everything. But they have to study. MONTAGNE: Why do you think your mother was different? T SADISAIDI: I don't know. My mother never have gone to school because her father, her uncles, no one liked school. But my mother likes school. My mother - lots of people says that she's uneducated. But she said, no, my daughter will be educated. MONTAGNE: One irony of Kandahar being a war zone, there may just be more opportunities for girls who want to grow up to be working women. There's the U. N. , NATO and USAID, all hiring and paying well. Also offering desk jobs for women who can use computers and speak English, construction companies and the cellphone giant Roshan. The more obvious thing for a girl trying to learn and work here - it's dangerous. Somehow every girl and her family must come to terms with the possibility that harm could come to her. When I broach the subject with young Nurzia, she brushes off the threats that the community center has passed on to her parents. There is a war going on. Has it ever stopped you from coming to school? Is it dangerous or your mother doesn't want you to? NURZIA: No, no. MONTAGNE: And your parents have never been too scared for you? NURZIA: No. They always say that the center is warning. But it's lie. It's not true. MONTAGNE: So sometimes there are warnings for girls not to go to school? NURZIA: Yeah. Yeah. MONTAGNE: But you don't believe it? NURZIA: No I don't believe it because it's lie. MONTAGNE: Nurzia's family chooses to view threats as intimidation, pure and simple, by the Taliban or warlords or drug dealers - anyone who might benefit from fear and disorder. The family of Tahira and Shahira Sadisaidi do allow themselves to be scared, but not scared away. T SADISAIDI: Some months ago in - near to our house, one girl was killed by someone. She was working. She was our classmate. My mother always says, when you are coming, I'm just waiting. I'm looking at the door if they come or someone come and says that they are - they will be killed. So we are coming. We are just - we want to be brave. And we are coming to school. MONTAGNE: At the Afghan Canadian Community Center, a pushy horn signals the end of the school day. The young girls tighten their head scarves, the older ones pull on their burkas. They hold their books to their chests like a shield and once again, disappear onto the streets of Kandahar.

JIM ZARROLI, BYLINE: This is Donald Trump's new hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, not far from the White House. It's built in a grand old federal post office building.

The president-elect has borrowed from foreign banks his administration will regulate. He does business in countries that are vital U. S. allies. And he has lots of pending lawsuits working their way through federal court. POTTER: The number of problems is actually sort of mind-boggling.

It's normal for leaders to congratulate a new president. This week, some of the first congratulatory messages came from leaders who are known for committing broad crackdowns on human rights. One was Egypt's president. NPR's Jane Arraf joins us from Cairo. Hi, Jane. JANE ARRAF, BYLINE: Hi, Ari. SHAPIRO: So Egypt's president says he was the first foreign leader to call to congratulate President-elect Trump. Why the rush? ARRAF: Well, he really seemed to want to make a point. And the point was that he believes that Egypt will be better treated under a Trump administration than it was under Obama. Now, Egypt has not been badly treated by the U. S. by objective standards. It still gets billions of dollars in foreign aid. But the Egyptian leader really resents the criticism that goes along with that aid. He's been accused of human rights abuses of democratic rollbacks. And he says that he doesn't get nearly enough credit for the fight that he believes he has to fight here against political Islamists and against the Islamic State group. He thinks that might change under Trump. SHAPIRO: So how much of this is about language, praise or criticism? And how much is about actual U. S. policy towards Egypt? ARRAF: Well, a lot of it actually is just about language. As you know, authoritarian leaders around the world tend to be fairly thin-skinned. So as soon as they get a president who doesn't criticize them, in their view, incessantly over things like human rights and actually does show some support for the fights that they're fighting at home, that's going to be a real bonus in their view. But they're also looking for material support as well. They want more money. They will want more weapons. They will want more of everything from the U. S. in what they believe is a shared fight in many ways and without all the questions that have gone along with it as to how they're fighting that fight. SHAPIRO: Beyond Egypt, there are other controversial leaders who seem happy about Trump's election. What do they have in common? ARRAF: Well, according to Steven Cook, who I spoke with - he's the senior Middle East fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations in D. C. - he says that quite a few of them believe that human rights and democracy aren't going to be really high up on Trump's list of foreign priorities, and that's possibly because it isn't very high up on their list, seemingly. STEVEN COOK: They have projected a kind of view of Trump - and I think Trump projects this himself of getting down to the real important issues. And those things aren't questions of human rights and democracy but more of security and migration of people and countering extremism. All those things are very important, but quite obviously, people who are of authoritarians or have authoritarian streaks would like to deal with those things in different ways. SHAPIRO: So, Jane, who are some of the other leaders in this group we're talking about? ARRAF: Well, first, of course there is the Russian president, Vladimir Putin. And now Trump has said that the U. S. should let Russia do the fighting in Syria. The problem is of course that Russia is fighting to prop up the Syrian regime that's bombing its own people. There's the Hungarian president. His government has fenced off its border with Serbia to keep out migrants. And that might sound a little bit familiar. There's the president of the Philippines, who has used obscenities to describe President Obama. He's looking forward to turning a new page. Now, we don't know, Ari, if this will or how it will add up to changes in U. S. foreign policy. But these are just a few of the leaders who seem to think that Trump will indeed be good news for them. SHAPIRO: NPR's Jane Arraf speaking with us from Cairo. Thank you, Jane. ARRAF: Thank you, Ari.

This week, some of the first congratulatory messages came from leaders who are known for committing broad crackdowns on human rights. One was Egypt's president. NPR's Jane Arraf joins us from Cairo. Hi, Jane. JANE ARRAF, BYLINE: Hi, Ari. SHAPIRO: So Egypt's president says he was the first foreign leader to call to congratulate President-elect Trump. Why the rush? ARRAF: Well, he really seemed to want to make a point. And the point was that he believes that Egypt will be better treated under a Trump administration than it was under Obama. Now, Egypt has not been badly treated by the U. S. by objective standards. It still gets billions of dollars in foreign aid. But the Egyptian leader really resents the criticism that goes along with that aid. He's been accused of human rights abuses of democratic rollbacks. And he says that he doesn't get nearly enough credit for the fight that he believes he has to fight here against political Islamists and against the Islamic State group. He thinks that might change under Trump. SHAPIRO: So how much of this is about language, praise or criticism? And how much is about actual U. S. policy towards Egypt? ARRAF: Well, a lot of it actually is just about language. As you know, authoritarian leaders around the world tend to be fairly thin-skinned. So as soon as they get a president who doesn't criticize them, in their view, incessantly over things like human rights and actually does show some support for the fights that they're fighting at home, that's going to be a real bonus in their view. But they're also looking for material support as well. They want more money. They will want more weapons. They will want more of everything from the U. S. in what they believe is a shared fight in many ways and without all the questions that have gone along with it as to how they're fighting that fight. SHAPIRO: Beyond Egypt, there are other controversial leaders who seem happy about Trump's election. What do they have in common? ARRAF: Well, according to Steven Cook, who I spoke with - he's the senior Middle East fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations in D. C. - he says that quite a few of them believe that human rights and democracy aren't going to be really high up on Trump's list of foreign priorities, and that's possibly because it isn't very high up on their list, seemingly. STEVEN COOK: They have projected a kind of view of Trump - and I think Trump projects this himself of getting down to the real important issues. And those things aren't questions of human rights and democracy but more of security and migration of people and countering extremism. All those things are very important, but quite obviously, people who are of authoritarians or have authoritarian streaks would like to deal with those things in different ways. SHAPIRO: So, Jane, who are some of the other leaders in this group we're talking about? ARRAF: Well, first, of course there is the Russian president, Vladimir Putin. And now Trump has said that the U. S. should let Russia do the fighting in Syria. The problem is of course that Russia is fighting to prop up the Syrian regime that's bombing its own people. There's the Hungarian president. His government has fenced off its border with Serbia to keep out migrants. And that might sound a little bit familiar. There's the president of the Philippines, who has used obscenities to describe President Obama. He's looking forward to turning a new page. Now, we don't know, Ari, if this will or how it will add up to changes in U. S. foreign policy. But these are just a few of the leaders who seem to think that Trump will indeed be good news for them. SHAPIRO: NPR's Jane Arraf speaking with us from Cairo. Thank you, Jane. ARRAF: Thank you, Ari.", "section": "World", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

He started assembling choices for his cabinet and has called foreign leaders - among them, France's president, Francois Hollande. Sylvie Kauffmann is editorial director and columnist for Le Monde, the French newspaper. And she joins us from Paris. Thanks so much for being with us. SYLVIE KAUFFMANN: My pleasure. SIMON: What has been the range of reaction to Donald Trump's election throughout France? KAUFFMANN: Of course, the first reaction was surprise and shock because, as most people, the French had also bet on Hillary Clinton's victory. Since then, the polls have shown that most people are concerned. You know, people don't know much about Donald Trump. They are worried about the statements that have made him famous. And there's also a lot of concerns about the impact on domestic elections in France, for instance. SIMON: Now, your newspaper has written that, faced with Trump's America-first foreign policy, Europe needs to embrace a Europe-first foreign policy. What would that be? KAUFFMANN: Well, yes. The meaning, basically, is that there's a transition period now. There are 10 weeks. Instead of waiting for the president-elect to say what he wants to do with Europe, since, when he has been showing interest, it's been mostly disdain, Europe should seize the initiative and say what it wants to do, what kind of relationship it wants with the United States and how this relationship should be organized. SIMON: According to the polls, President Hollande has an approval rating of only 4 percent. And I wonder if Marine Le Pen, the National Front and her supporters think that there is some kind of encouragement in Donald Trump's victory in the United States. KAUFFMANN: Yes. This is another reason for concern (laughter) in France in particular because we have this presidential election in not even six months from now. And Marine Le Pen is already on top of the polls for the first round. The election result in the U. S. has really, I think, emboldened her. And she's - she was one of the first European politicians to congratulate Donald Trump on Wednesday morning. She sent her congratulations on Twitter. This wave of populism and of discontent, which has started with the Brexit vote in June - now in the U. S. And she hopes that the third stage will be France. SIMON: I wonder if you and your colleagues at Le Monde have wondered if journalists in France might be underestimating the strength of the National Front in a way that journalists and pundits in the United States underestimated Donald Trump's electoral strength. KAUFFMANN: It's a discussion we're having, absolutely. But the National Front has been around for more than 20 years now. We have seen the rise of this movement in the polls election after election. What our discussion is more focused on now is whether we understand the deep roots of this phenomenon. Why are these people angry? Why are blue-collar workers deserting the Communist Party and Socialist Party to join the National Front?

Over the past several years, U. S. -Russia relations have deteriorated. But President-elect Trump and President Vladimir Putin say they are hoping to forge stronger ties. And that worries some of Russia's neighbors. Baltic states Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia are all NATO members, and they are nervous about Trump's criticisms of NATO, especially as Russia seeks to weaken that alliance. NPR's Moscow correspondent Lucian Kim is in Tallinn, the capital of Estonia. Welcome, and thanks so much for joining us. LUCIAN KIM, BYLINE: Good to be with you, Michel. MARTIN: So what have you been hearing from Estonians? KIM: Well, probably the best words to describe the mood here are worried and puzzled. What's interesting is nobody actually wants to go on the record and talk publicly about it. Just by coincidence, the Estonian governing coalition collapsed the day after the U. S. elections. So politicians are sort of in their own negotiations, and they're taking a wait-and-see attitude towards what happens in the U. S. It should be said, though, that, you know, Brexit was really a big shock for the Estonians, and now the U. S. elections are coming as a second - second big shock. MARTIN: How closely do people follow the U. S. elections there? Are they aware that President-elect Trump took some positions on NATO? KIM: Oh, well, they're very aware of the comments here. Why it's so sensitive in the Baltic states is that they were annexed by the Soviet Union at the end of World War II. Once the Baltic countries gained independence in 1991, they really saw joining NATO and the European Union as the best guarantee for their security. And why they're now feeling uncertain was, well, first of all, there was the annexation of Crimea by Russia in 2014, and that really created new worries here. The Baltic states are really quite defenseless. They don't have their own air forces and they have no tanks. MARTIN: And we know that Donald Trump and former Putin are friendly. But how might that friendship, or whatever it is, effect the Baltic situation? KIM: Well, from what I'm hearing is the main worry for the Baltics is that some kind of deal will be struck above their heads. These are very small countries. And in their history, larger countries have often decided their fate. Interestingly enough, one name that I've been hearing ever since I arrived in Tallinn is Newt Gingrich. Of course, he's being considered as a possible secretary of state. And that makes people in Estonia especially very nervous. During the summer, Gingrich called Estonia a suburb of St. Petersburg and said it's probably not worth risking a nuclear war for that suburb. MARTIN: Well, before we let you go, Lucian, it's really hard to calibrate such a thing, but what is the sense there of how realistic these fears are of kind of further - of Russian aggression in this area? Is that deemed to be a real possibility? KIM: Well, I put that question to a former Estonian diplomat. It was actually interesting what he said. He said the threat isn't constant. He said if there is a strong deterrent, if the West is firm and unified, then the threat level is actually quite low. But if there is a weak deterrent or no deterrent, then the threat level goes up because the Kremlin might be encouraged to test NATO's commitment to that area. Actually, to counter that perception, any perception or misconceptions in Moscow, NATO has decided to deploy troops to the Baltic region starting next year. And Estonians are working under the assumption that that will not change under a Trump administration. MARTIN: That's NPR's Lucian Kim in Tallinn, the capital of Estonia.

That's because the European Union is built on principles like free trade and the free movement of people, the very things Trump repeatedly attacked during his presidential campaign. For more on how Trump's election might affect Europe, we turn to NPR's Frank Langfitt, who is in Brussels right now. Hi, Frank. FRANK LANGFITT, BYLINE: Hey. Good morning, Rachel. MARTIN: I happened to glance at the cover of Der Spiegel magazine, a German magazine that came out after the American election, and it had this picture of Donald Trump's face looking angry. And he was essentially screaming and chasing after - and looks like he's about to consume - the entire globe. And the title of the cover - on the cover - was \"The End Of The World (As We Know It). \" Is that the overall reaction in Europe? Is that an exaggerated reaction? What are you seeing? LANGFITT: I think that's an initial reaction. And I think what I've been hearing sort of is a mixture of fear, uncertainty and also a little - well, more than a little bit of contempt. People here are worried that his election is going to embolden right-wing nationalist parties in Europe. We've got some crucial elections coming up next year. Other people are afraid that he's going to align with Vladimir Putin, the Russian president who Trump has praised, and kind of sell out U. S. allies, which, I don't know, a few days ago would have been absolutely unthinkable. And then there's Jean-Claude Juncker. He's the head of the European Commission. He dismisses Trump as a know-nothing. And yesterday his money quote was we will waste two years before Mr. Trump tours the world he does not know. MARTIN: So what influence do you think Trump's victory could have on elections that are happening across the pond? LANGFITT: Well, I think the fear of liberal Democrats here is momentum. You know, first we had the surprise Brexit vote in the U. K. in June that was anti-immigrant, anti-globalization. Last week, Trump's victory. Next year, you've got elections in France, Germany and the Netherlands. Right-wing parties there look to kind of extend this as a win streak. Take France, Marine Le Pen - her National Front, very similar platform to Trump. She wants France to follow the U. K. and leave the EU. I was talking to Rosa Balfour - she follows European politics at The German Marshall Fund here in Brussels - and she says Trump's victory could be a boost. ROSA BALFOUR: You know, Marine Le Pen has seen that it is possible to become president of the United States, so why not become president of France? If France leaves the European Union, that's the end of the European Union. LANGFITT: And you know, Rachel, the way for Americans to think about this is to remember that the EU has helped bind Europe together and keep the peace on the continent, you know, after two world wars. And so the idea that it could disintegrate really frightens a lot of people here. And I was also talking to a guy named Steven Blockmans. He's with the Centre for European Policy Studies. And he's more optimistic about the EU being able to hold itself together, especially given the complexities the U. K. is already grappling with so far with Brexit. STEVEN BLOCKMANS: The socio-economic web, political web which has been woven throughout the European Union for decades now is so tight that indeed it becomes very costly and a lengthy process to disentangle a country from it. And this is what the Brits are now realizing. MARTIN: So there's been talk over here, Frank, about how Donald Trump said a lot of stuff on the campaign. LANGFITT: Right. MARTIN: But will he be that in office? Will he govern the way he campaigned? I mean, are EU officials thinking through that? Are they hoping that some of the stuff he said won't translate into policy? LANGFITT: Absolutely. And the contrast to the Der Spiegel cover that you mentioned is this hope that he is not who he said he was. Rosa Balfour, who we just heard from, she pointed out that Europe has seen populist politicians itself. It knows them well. She calls them mini Trumps. And they often promise radical change, but then once they get into power they scale it back. So that's what people here are hoping for. MARTIN: NPR's Frank Langfitt reporting from Brussels.

Even so, yesterday, a man armed with a suicide bomb found a way into the base, detonated that bomb and killed four Americans. The Taliban has taken responsibility for the attack. NPR's Pentagon correspondent Tom Bowman joins me now in the studio to talk about this. Hi, Tom. TOM BOWMAN, BYLINE: Hey, Rachel. MARTIN: What more can you tell us about how this happened? BOWMAN: Well, Rachel, what we're hearing from officials, both U. S. and Afghan, is that the suicide bomber somehow was able to get through security at the base. He detonated his vest on the main road, right on a sidewalk, near a group that was preparing for some sort of a fun run, a short race. Now, as you say, the Taliban has taken credit for this attack and said it was being planned for the past four months. A local governor, by the way, said this suicide bomber was part of a group of local workers, a detail, heading into the base. So they're still investigating. We don't know exactly what happened. And the attack left two American service members dead, two American contractors dead, and another 16 Americans were wounded along with a Polish soldier. MARTIN: Any idea about the condition of the wounded? BOWMAN: Well, officials I spoke with just a little while ago say five people were treated and returned to duty so, obviously, very light wounds. The remaining 12 were flown to Landstuhl Medical Center in Germany. It's a military hospital that provides a higher level of care. Now, there's a very good military hospital at Bagram. I was there just back in June. And the fact that these people were flown to Germany means that some were. . . MARTIN: Serious, yeah. BOWMAN: . . . Pretty seriously wounded, yeah. MARTIN: So you have been to Bagram numerous times, Tom. Describe just how hard it is to get through all the security. I mean, this is a really big deal. This is a big security breach. BOWMAN: Yeah, Yeah. This - you have to go through multiple levels of security. You have to show an ID, pass through metal detectors, full body scans, kind of like the ones you see at airports. And, now, I usually fly into Bagram on military aircraft. But over the years, there've been times when I've, you know, driven up from Kabul. And I would have a hard time getting in. I would show my ID, my passport. And I would end up having to call someone and have - they'd come back down to the gate and pick me up. MARTIN: So this means this had to have been some kind of an inside job. And how disconcerting is that? BOWMAN: Well, there are thousands of U. S. and NATO troops up there so this is very disconcerting. This has never happened before. And - so they're trying to figure out what happened. You know, it could be that there was some insider help here. Maybe bomb components got in, and they assembled it. It could be that someone was radicalized. This has happened in the past with Afghan soldiers where they're carefully vetted. But they go home for a while. They're radicalized by the Taliban, or the Taliban threatens them - basically saying, listen, unless you kill Americans, we're going to kill your family. So they're investigating. We don't have the answers right yet. But clearly, there was a problem at that gate. That shouldn't - this should not have happened. MARTIN: NPR's Tom Bowman. Thanks so much, Tom. BOWMAN: You're welcome. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:  Bagram Air Base, outside Kabul, Afghanistan, is among the most tightly secured military facilities in the world. Even so, yesterday, a man armed with a suicide bomb found a way into the base, detonated that bomb and killed four Americans. The Taliban has taken responsibility for the attack. NPR's Pentagon correspondent Tom Bowman joins me now in the studio to talk about this. Hi, Tom. TOM BOWMAN, BYLINE: Hey, Rachel. MARTIN: What more can you tell us about how this happened? BOWMAN: Well, Rachel, what we're hearing from officials, both U. S. and Afghan, is that the suicide bomber somehow was able to get through security at the base. He detonated his vest on the main road, right on a sidewalk, near a group that was preparing for some sort of a fun run, a short race. Now, as you say, the Taliban has taken credit for this attack and said it was being planned for the past four months. A local governor, by the way, said this suicide bomber was part of a group of local workers, a detail, heading into the base. So they're still investigating. We don't know exactly what happened. And the attack left two American service members dead, two American contractors dead, and another 16 Americans were wounded along with a Polish soldier. MARTIN: Any idea about the condition of the wounded? BOWMAN: Well, officials I spoke with just a little while ago say five people were treated and returned to duty so, obviously, very light wounds. The remaining 12 were flown to Landstuhl Medical Center in Germany. It's a military hospital that provides a higher level of care. Now, there's a very good military hospital at Bagram. I was there just back in June. And the fact that these people were flown to Germany means that some were. . . MARTIN: Serious, yeah. BOWMAN: . . . Pretty seriously wounded, yeah. MARTIN: So you have been to Bagram numerous times, Tom. Describe just how hard it is to get through all the security. I mean, this is a really big deal. This is a big security breach. BOWMAN: Yeah, Yeah. This - you have to go through multiple levels of security. You have to show an ID, pass through metal detectors, full body scans, kind of like the ones you see at airports. And, now, I usually fly into Bagram on military aircraft. But over the years, there've been times when I've, you know, driven up from Kabul. And I would have a hard time getting in. I would show my ID, my passport. And I would end up having to call someone and have - they'd come back down to the gate and pick me up. MARTIN: So this means this had to have been some kind of an inside job. And how disconcerting is that? BOWMAN: Well, there are thousands of U. S. and NATO troops up there so this is very disconcerting. This has never happened before. And - so they're trying to figure out what happened. You know, it could be that there was some insider help here. Maybe bomb components got in, and they assembled it. It could be that someone was radicalized. This has happened in the past with Afghan soldiers where they're carefully vetted. But they go home for a while. They're radicalized by the Taliban, or the Taliban threatens them - basically saying, listen, unless you kill Americans, we're going to kill your family. So they're investigating. We don't have the answers right yet. But clearly, there was a problem at that gate. That shouldn't - this should not have happened. MARTIN: NPR's Tom Bowman. Thanks so much, Tom.

Next door in Syria, local forces have just begun their own operations to recapture the city of Raqqa, the de facto capital of ISIS. NPR's Tom Bowman takes a step back and looks at the efforts by the United States to manage this massive operation. And he reports that while there are military challenges, the greatest obstacle could be coalition politics. TOM BOWMAN, BYLINE: The man in charge of the coalition to defeat the Islamic State in both Syria and Iraq is an American, Lt. Gen. Steve Townsend. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)STEPHEN TOWNSEND: Good morning. It's evening here in Baghdad. BOWMAN: That's Gen. Townsend speaking recently to Pentagon reporters. What the Americans bring to the fight are three things - hundreds of commandos to kill and capture ISIS leaders, thousands of trainers to help the Iraqi army and the Syrian rebels. And maybe more important - airstrikes, tens of thousands, hitting everything from ISIS troops and trucks to artillery pieces and headquarters buildings. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TOWNSEND: We will continue conducting precision strikes to reduce the enemy's freedom of movement, attack their leaders and command and control. Because we understand that defeating them in Iraq and Syria is an essential step in the defeat of ISIL around the world. BOWMAN: U. S. officials are confident Iraqi ground forces have the momentum in Mosul. And now the focus will shift Raqqa, next door in Syria. But the fighting force there is nothing like Iraq's organized army. It's more a collection of Syrian, Arab and Kurdish fighters. CHRIS KOZAK: We've been very hard pressed to find said partners and build said partners on the ground. BOWMAN: Chris Kozak is an analyst at the Institute for the Study of War. KOZAK: That's why Raqqa is going on a slower time scale than Mosul right now, I would argue, because of these difficulties. BOWMAN: Officials say Mosul could take weeks. Raqqa may take months. So this could be an early issue for President Trump. Still, Gen. Townsend said he supports heading toward Raqqa with the forces that have assembled. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TOWNSEND: I believe that there are sufficient local forces already available for that operation. However, we have a plan to recruit and equip and train more local forces for that operation. BOWMAN: But Gen. Townsend's confidence soon faded when talk turned to politics. The problem is this - the Kurds make up the backbone of those Syrian fighters, known as the SDF, heading toward Raqqa. And neighboring Turkey, a U. S. ally, doesn't want those Kurds taking part. That's because Turkey sees them as an extension of a group mounting terrorist attacks in Turkey. When a reporter raised all this with Gen. Townsend, who appeared by satellite link at the Pentagon, this is what he said. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TOWNSEND: That's a tough one. I would use my out and say that our connection is garbled, but the truth is I heard the question. As you've correctly laid out the problem there, Turkey doesn't want to see us operating with the SDF anywhere and particularly in Raqqa. BOWMAN: The Pentagon's top officer, Gen. Joseph Dunford, secretly flew to Turkey and worked things out, at least for the time being. The Raqqa offensive started with those Kurdish forces. But analysts like Aaron Stein at the Atlantic Council say the tensions with Turkey are not going away. AARON STEIN: The fundamental problem in Syria is that the Turks oppose the ground force that the United States works most closely with. That's their number one security threat, the expansion of Kurdish control in Syria. BOWMAN: And Turkey also presents a headache next door in Iraq. Turkish forces set up a base inside the country to keep an eye on the Kurds it deems terrorists and have a say in post-ISIS politics. PATRICK MARTIN: Turkey has a small military presence northeast of Mosul, ostensibly at a base to train a local militia. BOWMAN: Patrick Martin is also an analyst at the Institute for the Study of War. MARTIN: Most of the Iraqi political groups want them out. They want to expel the Turkish presence and make sure that they do not have this base. BOWMAN: So far, the Americans have had less luck dealing with the Turkish question in Iraq. The Turks plan on staying. And they're also lining up more troops on the Iraqi border. Tom Bowman, NPR News, Washington.

S. ties with NATO. Obama's assurances to Europeans on that score come after candidate Trump had raised doubts about U. S. commitments abroad. Trump had spoken of NATO as obsolete and questioned whether the U. S. is getting enough value out of its alliances. These things matter a lot in the three Baltic republics formerly part of the Soviet Union now independent and part of NATO. Well, joining us now via Skype is the foreign minister of Lithuania, Linas Linkevicius. And welcome to the program once again. LINAS LINKEVICIUS: Thank you. SIEGEL: Back in July, NATO agreed to build up its positions in your part of the world, and now Vladimir Putin's spokesman says that Donald Trump could bring about a kind of detente in Europe if NATO would slow down its expansion near Russia's borders. Are you concerned that NATO may back down on its buildup in the Baltic republics and Poland? LINKEVICIUS: We all would like to see improvement, less tensions. And any effort is commendable, so I do understand. But I also believe and hope that it will be done according to international law, not self-invented rules by Russia, what Russia usually likes to do. We are concerned about the future. We don't know what will happen. But I believe it's premature to dramatize, premature to be disappointed. It's - really we have to give a chance to a new administration to start at least working and to appoint key officials. And frankly these officials will not come out of the blue. They will be appointed from Republican team which will know quite well. And continuity for U. S. policy was always a feature - so many reasons to rely on our future cooperation, maybe some changes but not dramatic or revolutionary. I do not expect. SIEGEL: You have mentioned, though, your concerns about this time of transition between U. S. administrations, the vacuum of leadership, in your words. LINKEVICIUS: Yes. SIEGEL: What are you concerned that Russia might try doing during that time of vacuum? LINKEVICIUS: Unfortunately I'm afraid it will be done - Testing, also maybe intensifying some activities in Ukraine or - I'm afraid. I'm really - I'm afraid to pre-judge - but very, very dangerous situation with regard to Aleppo. So let's really take it very seriously. SIEGEL: You've mentioned your confidence that the Republican foreign policy team that takes over will be people whom you are familiar with and people whose ideas you're familiar with. Do President Obama's assurances about Donald Trump - are they important to you? Do they satisfy you? LINKEVICIUS: All signals are important. President Obama tries to calm down, so to say, and to not be afraid about substantial changes. I also remember my meetings with some associates very close to President Trump like Rudy Giuliani, former mayor of New York. And we had very good meeting some time ago and remember how enthusiastic he was about Baltic States, about our performance, about any security issues. I cannot expect that he changed his mind, for instance. And we really have to engage each other to convince that what we are doing together - it's not at the expense of each other but for the sake of each other. That's very important. SIEGEL: On the subject of spending, Trump raised questions during the campaign about whether NATO members are paying their fair share. NATO members are supposed to spend at least 2 percent of gross domestic product on defense. LINKEVICIUS: Sure. SIEGEL: Last year Lithuania was at 1. 1 percent. I think only five NATO members made it to the targeted level. Do you feel that the NATO guarantee has been in some way made conditional upon your country spending more? LINKEVICIUS: I believe it's not about guarantees. I trust these guarantees, and this is working. But what we have to do and what we did recently will substantially improve this defense spending and owe close to 1. 8. And by 2018, we will have reached 2 percent - no doubt about that. This is really a kind of wakeup call, and we have to address this issue very seriously - all Europeans, not just us I believe. This is legitimate criticism from President Trump.

Iraqi forces with help from allies including the U. S. have entered the city after pushing through its rural outskirts. As NPR's Alice Fordham reports, things for now have slowed down. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: (Speaking Arabic). ALICE FORDHAM, BYLINE: In a makeshift army base a few miles from Mosul's frontlines, Iraqi soldiers are unloading defused mortar shells from a truck. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: (Speaking Arabic). FORDHAM: They're adding them to a display of weapons captured from ISIS and posing for triumphant photos in front of them. They have reason to celebrate. Despite fierce fighting, Iraqi forces have pushed all the way into Mosul. But talking to the men recently back from the front, fighting inside the city is presenting challenges. QUSAY AL-JUBOURI: (Speaking Arabic). FORDHAM: \"Yeah, yeah, it's because of the civilians,\" says one soldier named Qusay al-Jubouri. ISIS is using civilians as human shields. There may be a million people still living inside Mosul, and ISIS launches attacks from civilians' houses. AL-JUBOURI: (Speaking Arabic). FORDHAM: Jubouri says that means it's much more difficult to use airstrikes against the extremists or other heavy weapons. Inside the base's improvised HQ, his commanding officer, General Shaker al-Shwaily, says there's another problem - narrow city streets. GENERAL SHAKER AL-SHWAILY: (Speaking Arabic). FORDHAM: He says, \"we've entered, but our movement's slowed down because we have vehicles like tanks. \" In fact this is an armored division, so their tanks and Humvees get stuck in the small streets and are easy targets for ISIS. Soldiers and civilians are dying, although the military don't give casualty figures. And another factor - before the operations began, military and civilian leaders said that people would rise up inside Mosul against ISIS and help the armed forces. I asked the general about that. AL-SHWAILY: (Speaking Arabic). FORDHAM: \"No, in our area, nothing like that happened,\" he says. AL-SHWAILY: (Speaking Arabic). FORDHAM: He doesn't seem surprised. \"These are poor people,\" he says. About 50,000 people have fled Mosul, and in a camp for the displaced a few miles away, I meet a man who fled that urban fighting recently and only just made it. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: (Speaking Arabic). FORDHAM: He won't give his name because he's still afraid of ISIS. He tells me, no, people in Mosul can't fight against ISIS whether they want to or not. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: (Through interpreter) It's hard for us to resist them. We don't have weapons, and we have our children with us. FORDHAM: ISIS fighters know who everyone is and where they live. They would kill the family of any rebels, he says. He agrees the fight inside the city will be tough, but he says while ISIS is brutal and fighting hard, there aren't many of that fighters left alive. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: (Through interpreter) I think their numbers are small, but they try to deceive the security forces by hiding themselves between houses and moving around on motorcycles. FORDHAM: They shoot from one building then race off and shoot from another to make out there's a lot of them. For the moment, progress remains slow. ISIS is still using car bombs and snipers. But commanders remain optimistic. One counter-terror commander tells me on a recent day, his men were only hit by five ISIS car bombs, a light day's battle in Mosul. Alice Fordham, NPR News, northern Iraq. KELLY MCEVERS, HOST:  In Iraq, an offensive to retake the ISIS-held city of Mosul has been going on for a month. Iraqi forces with help from allies including the U. S. have entered the city after pushing through its rural outskirts. As NPR's Alice Fordham reports, things for now have slowed down. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: (Speaking Arabic). ALICE FORDHAM, BYLINE: In a makeshift army base a few miles from Mosul's frontlines, Iraqi soldiers are unloading defused mortar shells from a truck. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: (Speaking Arabic). FORDHAM: They're adding them to a display of weapons captured from ISIS and posing for triumphant photos in front of them. They have reason to celebrate. Despite fierce fighting, Iraqi forces have pushed all the way into Mosul. But talking to the men recently back from the front, fighting inside the city is presenting challenges. QUSAY AL-JUBOURI: (Speaking Arabic). FORDHAM: \"Yeah, yeah, it's because of the civilians,\" says one soldier named Qusay al-Jubouri. ISIS is using civilians as human shields. There may be a million people still living inside Mosul, and ISIS launches attacks from civilians' houses. AL-JUBOURI: (Speaking Arabic). FORDHAM: Jubouri says that means it's much more difficult to use airstrikes against the extremists or other heavy weapons. Inside the base's improvised HQ, his commanding officer, General Shaker al-Shwaily, says there's another problem - narrow city streets. GENERAL SHAKER AL-SHWAILY: (Speaking Arabic). FORDHAM: He says, \"we've entered, but our movement's slowed down because we have vehicles like tanks. \" In fact this is an armored division, so their tanks and Humvees get stuck in the small streets and are easy targets for ISIS. Soldiers and civilians are dying, although the military don't give casualty figures. And another factor - before the operations began, military and civilian leaders said that people would rise up inside Mosul against ISIS and help the armed forces. I asked the general about that. AL-SHWAILY: (Speaking Arabic). FORDHAM: \"No, in our area, nothing like that happened,\" he says. AL-SHWAILY: (Speaking Arabic). FORDHAM: He doesn't seem surprised. \"These are poor people,\" he says. About 50,000 people have fled Mosul, and in a camp for the displaced a few miles away, I meet a man who fled that urban fighting recently and only just made it. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: (Speaking Arabic). FORDHAM: He won't give his name because he's still afraid of ISIS. He tells me, no, people in Mosul can't fight against ISIS whether they want to or not.

N. Outgoing Secretary General Ban Ki-moon steps down at the end of the year. And Trump has promised to drop out of the Paris climate change agreement, which is Ban Ki-moon's biggest legacy. That's not all U. N. diplomats are worried about these days as NPR's Michele Kelemen reports. MICHELE KELEMEN, BYLINE: Technically, the U. N. says the U. S. can't pull out of the Paris climate change agreement for four years, but Deputy Secretary General Jan Eliasson understands the U. N. can't force countries to meet their target to limit greenhouse gas emissions. And often countries take their cues from the U. S. JAN ELIASSON: So you have a four-year period where nothing can change the agreement. But, of course, we all realize that the agreement builds on voluntary action and national actions. KELEMEN: His boss, the U. N. secretary general, has spoken to Trump by phone and is planning a follow-up meeting soon in part to talk about this. Eliasson says the U. N. is appealing to Trump as a businessman. ELIASSON: Already, I see many parts of the business community already aiming for a green economy. Not only is it the right thing to do to save the environment or the planet, but it's also turning out to be good business. KELEMEN: Eliasson is no newcomer to American politics. He was Sweden's ambassador in Washington when the Bush administration took over from President Clinton. ELIASSON: What I recall was at that time when the shift Clinton-Bush took place that in fact a couple months into the new administration, the Bush administration withdrew from the Kyoto Protocol. KELEMEN: While the U. S. pulled out of the Kyoto Protocol, the climate agreement at the time, it did not leave the U. N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, a treaty ratified by Congress in 1992. There's some speculation a Trump administration may try to do that, but Ben Cardin, a Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has a hard time believing it. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BEN CARDIN: I would find it extremely difficult to understand how the United States would want to be the only major country in the world that's not part of the discussions as it relates to these issues. KELEMEN: The Maryland senator says such a move would marginalize the U. S. on the world stage and not just on the topic of climate change. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)CARDIN: Look, I've gone through a lot of different administrations. They handle things differently, but we've never seen the United States sort of give up its role on international diplomacy and international engagement on all fronts. KELEMEN: Trumps victory raises other questions for the U. N. system. He ran a campaign that tapped into anger about globalism and migration at a time when the U. N. is trying to cope with a massive migration crisis with 65 million people uprooted by war. The U. N. deputy secretary general says there is a debate now in the U. S. and in Europe that pits, in his words, classical liberal internationalism against nationalism with populist undertones. ELIASSON: I would say we are at a historic stage - what kind of direction we will go, and therefore I think the elections in United States like the Brexit in Europe and even the referendum in Colombia has international ramifications. We live in a world where we are all dependent on each other. KELEMEN: That will be a challenge for the next secretary general, Antonio Guterres who spent recent years as head of the U. N.

The book in question is a first-edition copy of \"100 Hundred Years Of Solitude\" by Gabriel Garcia Marquez. It was stolen from a book fair in Bogota, Colombia. Cases in that city can go unsolved because of lack of resources, but local law enforcement went all out to solve this crime. Daniel Alarc\u00f3n is the host of the podcast Radio Ambulante and he is here to tell us the story. Welcome. DANIEL ALARC\u00d3N, BYLINE: Hi, Kelly. It's good to be here. MCEVERS: So tell us what happened? ALARC\u00d3N: So this story was reported by my colleague Camila Segura, who's the senior editor of Radio Ambulante. She's a Colombian journalist. She lives in Bogota. She studied literature, in fact. And what happened was that they were celebrating Garcia Marquez's life the year after he passed away. They always invite a country to be like a, you know, a special guest at the book fair in Bogota. And that year they invited Macondo, which is the made-up country that Garcia Marquez wrote about in so many novels. MCEVERS: (Laughter). ALARC\u00d3N: So as part of the collection - or part of the exhibition about Macondo, they had a collection of first editions that were brought by a bookseller. And, you know, I've been to that book fair, Kelly, like, thousands of people come through there. I was there that year, in fact, though I did not steal the book. And it was just scores and scores of people. And in the midst of all that chaos, one day one of the booksellers that was in charge of looking over this collection of books saw, well, look at that, the window of this glass case is ajar and there's a book missing. And it was a first edition, signed, of \"100 Hundred Years Of Solitude. \"MCEVERS: Wow. And so what happened next? ALARC\u00d3N: What happened next was surprising. The theft of a book became national news, you know, and people were outraged. And there was just like this kind of visceral feeling that this was some kind of, like, attack on the national pride. And it's kind of unclear, but some booksellers had said someone had come around trying to sell something. There were competing stories, but the story that we heard involved a shootout. It involved, you know, a high-speed chase through downtown Bogota. MCEVERS: What? ALARC\u00d3N: It involved stakeouts and informants and people running away into the neighborhood and disappearing and finding the book in a box kind of on the street. MCEVERS: So they were being chased and they were running and they were just, like, I'm going to leave this here. That's the story that you heard? ALARC\u00d3N: Yeah. And what's interesting is that the case is both open and closed simultaneously in the sense that they have recovered the stolen property, but no one's been arrested for the crime itself. MCEVERS: Wow. So why are you interested in this story? ALARC\u00d3N: Well, I'm interested in any story that complicates our vision of Latin America, and really there's nothing more. When I started writing at the Writers' Workshop in Iowa, my peers - if they had read any Latin American writer, they'd read Garcia Marquez. And, you know, Garcia Marquez is both an iconic figure and, you know, he's not quite as relevant as he used to be. Like, we're reading different books, we're discussing different things. The world that he described is not the world that exists anymore in Latin America. Latin America is much more urban than it was when Garcia Marquez was telling his stories about Macondo, you know? MCEVERS: Right. ALARC\u00d3N: And so I was really interested in this clash. And I think Camila was, too. And the fact that these two worlds collided in front of an audience of hundreds of thousands of millions of people, who you know, followed the news of this stolen book in its recovery was also super attractive to me as a storyteller.

In just under two months, Donald Trump will take the oath of office, and there's no shortage of speculation about what sort of president he will be. Here's one example. He could either be a strongly pro-Israel president or someone seen by American Jews as accommodating anti-Semitism, or maybe both at the same time, as NPR's Tom Gjelten explains. TOM GJELTEN, BYLINE: Donald Trump's major speech before a Jewish audience was last March when he assured The American Israel Public Affairs Committee that he was a lifelong supporter and true friend of Israel. One promise in that speech got Trump a thunderous reception. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)DONALD TRUMP: We will move the American embassy to the eternal capital of the Jewish people, Jerusalem. (APPLAUSE)GJELTEN: Previous presidents have made that promise but haven't kept it. Trump insists he'll be the exception. One of his closest advisers, his son-in-law Jared Kushner, is himself an Orthodox Jew. For those reasons, some American Jews have a positive impression of Trump. Rabbi Mark Dratch is executive vice president of the Orthodox Rabbinical Council of America. MARK DRATCH: The general sense is that he has a love of the state of Israel, that he understands the security needs of the state of Israel, he understands the special relationship that exists between the United States and Israel. GJELTEN: And yet, Dratch says his group worries about the people around Donald Trump. DRATCH: The campaign and statements and tweets have opened the door for those with anti-Semitic for anti-minority or anti-black or anti-Muslim feelings express themselves in ways that we have not seen for quite a while in this country. GJELTEN: This is the challenge for Trump - being strongly pro-Israel may not be enough to assure American Jews his presidency will be good for them. For one thing, Jews are themselves a minority. Sentiments against immigrants or Muslims or other minorities, whether by Trump or his key supporters, can make Jews nervous. Jamie Kirchick is a columnist for Tablet magazine, which focuses on Jewish issues. JAMIE KIRCHICK: When you have a demagogic movement that targets people because of their race or ethnicity or whatever, it's only a matter of time before they come to the Jews. They might not be coming to the Jews now, but they will get around them eventually. GJELTEN: Then there's the issue of what Trump does not say, like when journalist Julia Ioffe wrote an article critical of Melania Trump and got subjected to a barrage of attacks on her as a Jew. Asked about those anti-Semitic slurs, Trump said only that Ioffe had written an inaccurate article. To Jane Eisner, that sounded like he was excusing the anti-Semitic attacks. Eisner is editor-in-chief of the Jewish newspaper the Forward. JANE EISNER: By doing that, he has encouraged a far-right fringe - and I hope it's just a fringe - to feel empowered and to do the nasty things that they do in his name. GJELTEN: Lots of attention right now is on Steve Bannon, the Breitbart News executive serving as Trump's strategic adviser. Under his leadership, Breitbart has published antifeminist, anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant articles and won a reputation as being allied with those nationalists who favor white European values here. He's also pro-Israel, an outspoken Zionist, but the Tablet's Jamie Kirchick says white nationalists see Israel as organized along ethnic lines. For that reason, he says, they can be pro-Israel and still anti-minority here in the United States. KIRCHICK: They see Israel as an ethno-nationalist state, and they want to mimic that in the United States. That's what they like. GJELTEN: The Zionist Organization of America held a big awards dinner last night. The group's leaders insist that Trump and Bannon are not anti-Semites, and they cite their pro-israel positions as evidence. The group's leader tells NPR Bannon asked to attend the dinner. In the end, however, he did not show up. Tom Gjelten, NPR News, Washington. DAVID GREENE, HOST:  All right. In just under two months, Donald Trump will take the oath of office, and there's no shortage of speculation about what sort of president he will be. Here's one example. He could either be a strongly pro-Israel president or someone seen by American Jews as accommodating anti-Semitism, or maybe both at the same time, as NPR's Tom Gjelten explains. TOM GJELTEN, BYLINE: Donald Trump's major speech before a Jewish audience was last March when he assured The American Israel Public Affairs Committee that he was a lifelong supporter and true friend of Israel. One promise in that speech got Trump a thunderous reception. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DONALD TRUMP: We will move the American embassy to the eternal capital of the Jewish people, Jerusalem. (APPLAUSE) GJELTEN: Previous presidents have made that promise but haven't kept it. Trump insists he'll be the exception. One of his closest advisers, his son-in-law Jared Kushner, is himself an Orthodox Jew. For those reasons, some American Jews have a positive impression of Trump. Rabbi Mark Dratch is executive vice president of the Orthodox Rabbinical Council of America. MARK DRATCH: The general sense is that he has a love of the state of Israel, that he understands the security needs of the state of Israel, he understands the special relationship that exists between the United States and Israel. GJELTEN: And yet, Dratch says his group worries about the people around Donald Trump.

And we have a story about giving back. Saboor Sahely grew up in Afghanistan with a large extended family. In 1978, he decided to move to the United States. And here he talks with his youngest daughter, Jessica, about coming to America and the Afghan traditions he brought with him. SABOOR SAHELY: I vividly remember there was a lot of happiness and joy in eastern Afghanistan. If there was a wedding, the entire villages would show up. And you felt very welcome to going to each other's homes. And we knew who had what for dinner every night. And if we didn't like what we had for dinner, we always went to the neighbor's house. JESSICA SAHELY: (Laughter). SAHELY: So the summers are very, very hot. Everyone slept on the rooftop. And I vividly remember this old lady next door to us that would talk every night about her grandson, a student in the United States. That's when I heard the name of a country called America. I kept thinking, you know, I'm going to figure out a way to get to this far-away, magic land someday. Then Afghanistan basically plunged into a long civil war. And my father wanted me to leave the country because he knew that things are going to get worse. SAHELY: So what did you do for work here? SAHELY: One Sunday, I came to this restaurant. I walk in there. And the dishwasher hadn't shown up. And the manager asked me, when can I start? And I said, right away. I did that for a few months. And he moved me on, as I became a cook and then assistant manager. After that, we opened the restaurant. And we've treated every single customer as if they were part of our family. We have many regulars that eat three meals a day in our restaurant. And if they don't show up, we call them to make sure they're OK. We go to their funerals. We go to their weddings. These people have put shoes on my children's feet. And they deserve the best. So we should turn around and give something back every single chance we get. You know, my grandmother - she knew that most of the village did not have enough to eat. So whatever we had for dinner every night - she'd made sure that you had a plateful that I had to carry to different homes. So when I was in a position to give something back, we thought, on Thanksgiving Day, we're going to open our doors to anybody and everybody. Last year, for instance, we had over 800 people that come to the door. We're very, very lucky. And I don't take that for granted at all. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)INSKEEP: That's Saboor Sahely and his daughter Jessica in Logan, Utah. This is the 26th year they provided free Thanksgiving dinner to their community.

Now they are living under assault from troops that are trying to free the city from ISIS control. The assault on the city started more than a month ago and civilians are caught in the crossfire. As winter approaches, things are getting worse. Alex Milutinovic is the International Rescue Committee's Iraq country director. He joins us via Skype from the city of Erbil, about an hour outside of Mosul. Welcome to the program. ALEX MILUTINOVIC: Thank you. SHAPIRO: What is life like for people who are living in Mosul now? MILUTINOVIC: Well, the life for people in Mosul is, you know, it's getting more and more complicated and difficult. People have been living under ISIS for two years. And they've endured all kind of horrible things. So, you know, now they're basically coming under direct conflict between the Iraqi army and ISIS. And as the conflict heats up and as the more neighborhoods are being taken, civilian lives are coming at risk. SHAPIRO: How many people are we talking about? How many civilians are still in the city? MILUTINOVIC: We're expecting between 1 and 1. 2 million people are still within the city. SHAPIRO: So people are caught in this direct conflict. Are they able to get food, water, electricity, the basic necessities to go about their daily lives? MILUTINOVIC: As you know, city is divided into two parts. There is a western part of city, which is, you know, on the western side of the Tigris River, and the eastern side. Basically western side is still open to Syria so we are seeing some supplies coming again, while eastern side is currently under attack by the Iraqi army. And that's where we are seeing more and more destruction. Unfortunately, the water connection is broken so people are not getting water. They're actually using water from dirty wells. So we are very concerned about the waterborne diseases coming up. The food is available still, but since the conflict and the shooting and snipers are active all day, it's very complicated for civilians to get outside to buy more products. We have seen a lot of casualties actually from people who actually venture outside to buy most-needed food. SHAPIRO: And I think many people think of Iraq as a hot desert country but Mosul is in the north. And as winter approaches temperatures are getting below freezing, aren't they? MILUTINOVIC: Absolutely, for the past three nights the temperatures are below freezing. So it's a very dire situation. And people don't have kerosene, which is usually used for heating. And for the past two years, the residents of Mosul since ISIS took over were not able to buy any heating products so they have to go and endure this cold weather with only blankets and winter clothes. SHAPIRO: People are caught in this sort of pincer between the Iraqi government and ISIS. Is the Iraqi government providing support and aid to civilians who are trapped in Mosul? MILUTINOVIC: Absolutely, the Iraqi government is doing the best they can to actually provide first aid and assistance to the civilians in Mosul. So they are trying to distribute food. They are trying to provide assistance any possible way. But also they're trying to fight a war at the same time. So that is a very complicated situation when they have to actually fight the battle but also ensure civilian safety. What we are seeing in Mosul right now is the Iraqi army is not using heavy weapons. So they are doing the best they can to not destroy the civilian infrastructure and not put the lives of civilian at risk. SHAPIRO: It's been more than six weeks since this assault began. What do you see as the next phase? Where do you expect things to go from here? MILUTINOVIC: I'm not a military expert, but looking to the situation on the ground it's very obvious that the eastern side will come under government control. And then anything can happen with the western side. And we expect on the western side there are 400,000 people that might come under siege. And we have seen how devastating siege can be in the situation of Aleppo and other cities. So we have a significant concern for people that remain in the city after eastern side is taken.

Iraqi forces have been waging that fight for some weeks with U. S. help. And NPR's Peter Kenyon is in Erbil, a city in northern Iraq not far away. Hi, Peter. PETER KENYON, BYLINE: Hi, Steve. INSKEEP: How's the Iraqi offensive going? KENYON: Slowly but it's still an advance. There's a brigadier general from the Iraqi Army who says new villages now taken in the South and Southwest of Mosul. U. S. trained counterterrorism forces have new territory in the East. That's all being cleared - mines, booby traps and the like. There's some controversy out in the West. This is an area - the city of Tal Afar. And the main road is now controlled by Iraqi-Shiite militias. They've been accused of sectarian abuses in the past. Tal Afar's largely a minority Turkmen area. And Baghdad is trying to reassure residents and allies like Turkey that these Shiite militias aren't going into the city. And there's a lot of skepticism here about that so people are watching it closely. INSKEEP: You've mentioned most of the points of the compass there, Peter - east, south, southwest, west - a reminder that there's fighting in most of the directions from this city. What does that mean for civilians in the area? KENYON: Well, as the pace of the military advance has slowed, the pace of civilian flight has picked up and is expected to keep picking up. Yesterday I was at the Hassan Shami camp, which is one that NPR visited just a few weeks ago. It was brand new then, nearly empty. Now it's packed and so is a new extension they just built. And there's more construction going on. As you can imagine, it's full of sad stories. I was talking to a middle-aged woman from Mosul about the destruction of the city that she loved. And then she mentioned that her own 25-year-old son had been beheaded by ISIS. And then as she was talking, another woman came up - quietly joined the conversation. Well, here's a bit of how it sounded. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: (Foreign language spoken). KENYON: Now, this first woman is saying her dead son left three children behind who need raising. And then the second woman came up and said they fled their Mosul neighborhood when a mortar hit their house. Her 8-year-old daughter was killed immediately, a 4-year-old son received light shrapnel wounds. She took me to the family's tent, showed me young Ahmed (ph) wounded in the head lightly. And then there's more of these stories, more families arriving every day. Aid groups are really scrambling to winterize the camps. There's rain coming in the forecast as early as Wednesday and the temperatures are down around freezing at night. INSKEEP: Do people at least have adequate food and supplies as the population of that camp keeps going up? KENYON: Yes. I would say they're keeping up but it's a scramble. They're slapping tarps on the tents to get ready for the rain. They're pouring gravel so they don't turn into swampy pits of mud all around. It's just blankets. There are some heaters, not enough gas to go around. Medical supplies are a bit scarce. Hospital beds in Erbil, in fact, in the emergency rooms are hard to find. So they're scrambling. It's not a crisis at this point, though. INSKEEP: We're talking with NPR's Peter Kenyon, who's in northern Iraq. Peter also covers Syria for us. And I want to ask about a major development in Syria, Peter, because we're told that Syria's government has continued attacking rebels in the city of Aleppo and they've taken some large part of the city. What have you learned? KENYON: Well, these are reports coming from the Syrian military state TV and a U. K. -based monitoring group - the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. They say this district of al-Sahur (ph) in Eastern Aleppo has fallen to government forces. That's seen as a significant blow to the rebels. They've been hit, of course, by intense airstrikes and bombardment, along with up to a quarter-million civilians living there. There are reports that thousands of those civilians have fled towards Syrian-Kurdish controlled parts of the city. The U. N. has condemned the assault and they say there is no military solution. But regime supporters have said breaking the hold on Aleppo could be a turning point. INSKEEP: They're offering their own military solution. That's NPR's Peter Kenyon. Peter, thanks.

There are reports that thousands of those civilians have fled towards Syrian-Kurdish controlled parts of the city. The U. N. has condemned the assault and they say there is no military solution. But regime supporters have said breaking the hold on Aleppo could be a turning point. INSKEEP: They're offering their own military solution. That's NPR's Peter Kenyon. Peter, thanks.

Conservatories got a boost after the 1959 revolution, producing several generations of talented musicians and composers. Harold Lopez-Nussa is part of a new crop of jazz players making their voices heard outside Cuba. Betto Arcos reports that Lopez-Nussa was trained in one of the country's classical conservatories. BETTO ARCOS, BYLINE: You can hear Harold Lopez-Nussa's training in his playing. (SOUNDBITE OF HAROLD LOPEZ-NUSSA SONG, \"LOBO'S CHA\")ARCOS: The 33-year-old pianist is reluctant to admit the classical influence on his jazz playing, but he's quick to acknowledge the education he and many others received. HAROLD LOPEZ-NUSSA: All of those great pianists that we have from Cuba now - they came from the classical training because this is the school that we have to learn music in Cuba. It's classical. So I did all my stuff there from 8 years old until 25. (SOUNDBITE OF HAROLD LOPEZ-NUSSA SONG, \"LOBO'S CHA\")NED SUBLETTE: He had a level of training that - it's really hard to get anywhere else. ARCOS: Ned Sublette is the author of \"Cuba And Its Music: From The First Drums To The Mambo. \"SUBLETTE: After the revolution in 1959, the new revolutionary government made culture a priority. And a system of conservatories has continued to this day. So you will meet Cuban musicians who have been trained from childhood to be competitive, professional musicians. And most of them have a conservatory background. ARCOS: But it's not just music school. Sublette quotes British musicologist Geoff Baker. SUBLETTE: There are four main streams of influence on Cuban musicians - family, conservatory, street and religion. ARCOS: Harold Lopez-Nussa certainly draws on the first two. (SOUNDBITE OF HAROLD LOPEZ-NUSSA SONG, \"FERIA\")ARCOS: His grandparents were musicians. His father is a respected drummer and music educator. LOPEZ-NUSSA: Before I was born, I have the music in my body and my blood. Eighty percent of what I am doing today and why I am a musician is because of my family. I have a lot of support from them - my father, my uncle, my mother, who was a piano teacher. ARCOS: As far as the last two streams of influence are concerned, Lopez-Nussa is not particularly religious, but he's certainly aware of the sounds of the street and Cuba's long tradition of popular music. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"FERIA\")LOPEZ-NUSSA: (Singing in Spanish). ARCOS: Lopez-Nussa started listening to jazz as a teenager with his friends at the conservatory. He says he's following in the footsteps of such great Cuban pianists as Ernesto Lecuona, Frank Emilio Flynn and Chucho Valdes. He remembers seeing Valdes up close when he was 10 years old. LOPEZ-NUSSA: He came to my school to play for the kids. And I was so impressed by his playing, this kind of freedom that he have with the keyboard. And I always thinking this experience. ARCOS: So it's no surprise that a tune Valdes made popular with his band Irakere turns up on Lopez-Nussa's new album. (SOUNDBITE OF HAROLD LOPEZ-NUSSA SONG, \"BACALAO CON PAN\")ARCOS: Harold Lopez-Nussa recently signed with an American label. He says improved relations between Cuba and the U. S. ushered in by the Obama administration have opened new opportunities. He'd like to see more Cuban musicians coming to play in the U. S. LOPEZ-NUSSA: And I also hope that more American musicians can come to Cuba and share with us his art and his music. I have a lot of hope about this approach that will be better for all of us.

The new Italian documentary \"Fire At Sea\" won top prize at this year's Berlin Film Festival for its look at today's refugee crisis. The newly translated novel These Are The Names won the Dutch equivalent of the Booker Prize for its look at the refugee crisis. Our critic-at-large John Powers says each offers an original way of looking at something it's easy to think you know all about. JOHN POWERS, BYLINE: If any image haunts TV news and perhaps our conscience, it's the seemingly ceaseless river of migrants seeking refuge from war, dictatorship and poverty. These desperate souls inspire pity, fear and election-year arguments about whether to offer them welcome or keep them out. Not surprisingly, many artists feel compelled to confront this refugee crisis. But the big question is how do you engage a humanitarian tragedy without haranguing the audience or laying on a guilt trip? You get different but complimentary answers and two prize-winning new works from Europe, one an observational documentary, the other a quasi-mythic novel. Gianfranco Rosi's ravishingly shot \"Fire At Sea\" takes place on the tiny, unglamorous Sicilian island of Lampedusa 70 miles from the coast of Africa. Year after year, tens of thousands of migrants turn up on disastrously overcrowded boats. So many come that the U. N. has an entire hazmat-suited system for handling them. They're rescued at sea, cleaned up, photographed, handed gold foil survival blankets and put in holding camps before being shipped to the mainland. Rosi cuts between these newly arrived refugees and an impressionistic look at the islanders for whom another boatload is basically something they hear about on the radio between golden oldies, like the one that gives its film its title. The newcomers don't affect the locals daily round of cooking, scuba diving or working as fishermen. Yes, there is one heroic doctor who helps the migrants, and he was outraged at the world's apathy. I salute you, Pietro Bartolo, but he's exceptional in every sense. The island's true exemplar is Samuele, a smart, naughty but decent preteen who practices the slingshot and pulls words out of his tight-lipped relatives like he was their therapist. While Samuele enjoys a happy, stable life, he's not without problems that feel a bit, well, metaphorical. He has a lazy eye that limits his vision and annoying anxiety he can't explain, although maybe we can because we know what's happening in the background of his life. Here, for instance, a radio dispatcher talks to a refugee boat in serious trouble. (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"FIRE AT SEA\")UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Please, faster, your position, please, your position. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: 33. 1. . . UNIDENTIFIED MAN: And then under, under. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: OK, 80. 52. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: How many people on board? UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: I think it's about 150 persons. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: What kind of boat? UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: It's between 130 and 150. Please, can you help us very quickly? Yeah, we are sinking. We are staying here in the same coordination. We will not move. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Madam, please, calm down because we will plan the rescue, but you need to calm down. OK, so save your battery. I will call you back, OK? POWERS: Without ever saying it, Rosi suggests that Samuele is like most of the West, which is cut off from the pain caught in that clip. Indeed, even as \"Fire At Sea\" moves us with the refugees' vulnerability, it shows us how their tragedy has become normalized. It's been so folded into the routine of life in Lampedusa that folks scarcely notice it. You get a very different approach to the refugee situation in These Are The Names, a taut novel by the acclaimed Dutch writer Tommy Wieringa, which possesses a symbolic sweep that recalls J. M. Coetzee's \"Waiting For The Barbarians. \" Set in the former Soviet empire, the book also interweaves two storyline's, yet Wieringa's point differs from the movie's. One of the stories centers on a boy who joins a small group of migrants traveling to the west from the republics of Central Asia. Abandoned in the middle of nowhere by crooked human traffickers, this ragtag group which includes a poacher, a small-time crook and a defenseless woman begins a grueling dog-eat-dog trek across a no-man's land that's every bit as harsh as Cormac McCarthy's \"The Road. \"Wieringa juxtaposes their story to that of a strangely named cop, Pontus Beg, a lonely 53-year-old in the imaginary city of Michailopol, who feels that his life and his society have become unmoored. This starts to change when he investigates the death of a local rabbi and uncovers truths about his own origins he never dreamed of. Even as the refugees make their journey across the landscape, Pontus Beg journeys into the past and into his own identity. Unlike \"Fire At Sea,\" the novel's two different realities intersect. I won't give away what happens, but I will say that unlike Samuele and his fellow islanders, Pontus Beg is pushed out of his comfort zone in a way that opens him up to life. Reading the biblical book of Exodus, the novel's title comes from his opening line. He realizes that these straggling migrants are living out a universal story about a search for the promised land. Taken together, \"Fire At Sea\" and \"These Are The Names\" offers us a two-step course in empathy. Where Rosi suggests we must stop ignoring the refugees' reality and acknowledge their presence as part of our lives, Wieringa reminds us that the refugees' desire to find a safe, nurturing place to call home doesn't make them unspeakably alien. It makes them just like us. GROSS: John Powers is film and TV critic for Vogue and vogue. com.

General Mattis retired as chief of U. S. Central Command just two years ago, and that's raised questions about whether the appointment so soon after his active service adheres to the spirit of civilian control over the military in this country. We will ask where that tradition comes from in just a few minutes this hour. But first, a newsmaker conversation with the man who will be General Mattis' British counterpart should the general win Senate approval. Sir Michael Fallon is the secretary of state for defence for the U. K. He's visiting the U. S. - the first visit from a British cabinet minister since the U. S. elections last month. He was kind enough to join us on Friday just off the plane at NPR West in Culver City, Calif. Mr. Secretary, thank you so much for speaking with us. MICHAEL FALLON: Pleasure. MARTIN: So we now know who you will likely be working with in the Trump administration - General Mattis. As I mentioned, he most recently led the Central Command which oversees military operations in the Middle East and Southeast Asia. And I just wondered if you'd ever met him or had a chance to speak with him. FALLON: I haven't met him myself, personally, yet. I'm looking forward to doing that. And let me congratulate him on his nomination and wish him well during the confirmation process. He is well known to our military. He's served, as you've said, in a number of commands and has also served with the NATO alliance. So our military are looking forward to working with him, and I'm looking forward to working with him because we're at a critical point now in the battle against ISIL in the Middle East, the need to stand up to Russian aggression in Eastern Europe and in many other trouble spots around the world, including Afghanistan. MARTIN: There's been so much change in the alliance on both sides of the Atlantic. I mean, certainly with Brexit on the U. K. side and then with the incoming Trump administration. Mr. Trump has espoused some very different views from our current president. For one thing, he's been a critic of NATO, at least he was while he was on the campaign trail. How is that received on your end? How do you hear that? FALLON: Well, we think he's got a point with his criticisms of NATO. First, he wants European countries to shoulder more of the burden and so do we. He's also, I think, made some criticisms of the NATO machinery. And, again, there were a number of reforms agreed back at the Wales and now the Warsaw summits this year to speed up the NATO decision-making, to cut through some of their bureaucracy and make sure that it can deploy its forces faster than it's been able to do before. So we're with president-elect on some of these criticisms. MARTIN: You also mentioned the battle against ISIL. Right now, U. S. and British forces are supporting Iraqi troops in the battle of Mosul. On the campaign trail, Donald Trump said the offensive has been a disaster. He said the American leaders planning it were quote, \"a group of losers for not launching a surprise attack. \" So two questions here. What is your view of the offensive? And given that Mr. Trump will be the commander in chief of American forces in about a month and a half or so, do you expect strategic changes in this broader campaign? FALLON: Well, if I can take the second one first, I think you have to aim off some of the campaign rhetoric, stuff he said during campaigns. That doesn't always translate through. I think Mario Cuomo famously said you campaign in poetry, and you govern in prose. And I'm not going to accuse President-elect Trump of perjury, but I think you can aim off some of the campaign rhetoric. And we'll judge the president-elect on what he says and what he does. Now, you asked me where the campaign is. The campaign in Iraq, the campaign is going well thanks to all the training that we and the United States have done and thanks to the airstrikes that we're putting in on top of the ground combat forces. In Syria, the campaign is not going well, but that's because of the civil war, which has still not been brought to an end and, at the moment, is beyond our power to bring it to an end because it is Russia that is the key to the Syrian regime there. MARTIN: You've been secretary of state for defence since 2014, if I have that right. FALLON: That's right. MARTIN: And this has been a time of increased tensions, you know, all over the world, really. I mean, we've seen, you know, the increased strength of - the rise, really, of ISIS or ISIL, as you've said. We've seen increased aggression from Russia. There's been a trend toward - how can I say - a more assertive nationalism in many countries around the world. And I think many people would argue that the Brexit vote was part of that. Many people might argue that Donald Trump's election was a part of that. I wondered whether this sort of more assertive nationalism has changed your job. FALLON: I don't think it's the rise of populism or nationalism itself. I think there are just a number of concurrent threats out there. And I draw the opposite conclusion, which is we should not withdraw individually into our shells. On the contrary, we should work harder at the partnerships and the alliances that bind us together. So the threats that are coming against us are international, and that's why the response has to be international as well, built around the key alliances that we have. MARTIN: That was Sir Michael Fallon. He is the secretary of state for defence for the U. K. We reached him on Friday as he passed through Los Angeles. Sir Michael, thank you so much for speaking with us. FALLON: Thank you. Pleasure.

And I just wondered if you'd ever met him or had a chance to speak with him. FALLON: I haven't met him myself, personally, yet. I'm looking forward to doing that. And let me congratulate him on his nomination and wish him well during the confirmation process. He is well known to our military. He's served, as you've said, in a number of commands and has also served with the NATO alliance. So our military are looking forward to working with him, and I'm looking forward to working with him because we're at a critical point now in the battle against ISIL in the Middle East, the need to stand up to Russian aggression in Eastern Europe and in many other trouble spots around the world, including Afghanistan. MARTIN: There's been so much change in the alliance on both sides of the Atlantic. I mean, certainly with Brexit on the U. K. side and then with the incoming Trump administration. Mr. Trump has espoused some very different views from our current president. For one thing, he's been a critic of NATO, at least he was while he was on the campaign trail. How is that received on your end? How do you hear that? FALLON: Well, we think he's got a point with his criticisms of NATO. First, he wants European countries to shoulder more of the burden and so do we. He's also, I think, made some criticisms of the NATO machinery. And, again, there were a number of reforms agreed back at the Wales and now the Warsaw summits this year to speed up the NATO decision-making, to cut through some of their bureaucracy and make sure that it can deploy its forces faster than it's been able to do before. So we're with president-elect on some of these criticisms. MARTIN: You also mentioned the battle against ISIL. Right now, U. S. and British forces are supporting Iraqi troops in the battle of Mosul. On the campaign trail, Donald Trump said the offensive has been a disaster. He said the American leaders planning it were quote, \"a group of losers for not launching a surprise attack. \" So two questions here. What is your view of the offensive? And given that Mr. Trump will be the commander in chief of American forces in about a month and a half or so, do you expect strategic changes in this broader campaign? FALLON: Well, if I can take the second one first, I think you have to aim off some of the campaign rhetoric, stuff he said during campaigns. That doesn't always translate through. I think Mario Cuomo famously said you campaign in poetry, and you govern in prose. And I'm not going to accuse President-elect Trump of perjury, but I think you can aim off some of the campaign rhetoric. And we'll judge the president-elect on what he says and what he does. Now, you asked me where the campaign is. The campaign in Iraq, the campaign is going well thanks to all the training that we and the United States have done and thanks to the airstrikes that we're putting in on top of the ground combat forces. In Syria, the campaign is not going well, but that's because of the civil war, which has still not been brought to an end and, at the moment, is beyond our power to bring it to an end because it is Russia that is the key to the Syrian regime there. MARTIN: You've been secretary of state for defence since 2014, if I have that right. FALLON: That's right. MARTIN: And this has been a time of increased tensions, you know, all over the world, really. I mean, we've seen, you know, the increased strength of - the rise, really, of ISIS or ISIL, as you've said. We've seen increased aggression from Russia. There's been a trend toward - how can I say - a more assertive nationalism in many countries around the world. And I think many people would argue that the Brexit vote was part of that. Many people might argue that Donald Trump's election was a part of that. I wondered whether this sort of more assertive nationalism has changed your job. FALLON: I don't think it's the rise of populism or nationalism itself. I think there are just a number of concurrent threats out there. And I draw the opposite conclusion, which is we should not withdraw individually into our shells. On the contrary, we should work harder at the partnerships and the alliances that bind us together. So the threats that are coming against us are international, and that's why the response has to be international as well, built around the key alliances that we have. MARTIN: That was Sir Michael Fallon. He is the secretary of state for defence for the U. K. We reached him on Friday as he passed through Los Angeles. Sir Michael, thank you so much for speaking with us. FALLON: Thank you. Pleasure.", "section": "World", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Thanks so much for being with us. MUHANNAD HADI: Thank you for having me. SIMON: What did you see? What did you discover? HADI: What I saw was heartbreaking. Even the second I started landing in Sana'a Airport, I was looking around in the faces of the people and I saw agony on their face. They were so puzzled by just seeing another U. N. convoy pass by, wondering if this U. N. convoy, if this mission bringing hope to them, an end to this war or just another U. N. mission going there for another assessment and maybe another talk. And that all before I even went to the field and before I even saw the catastrophes I saw in my own eyes. SIMON: There was a two-day cease-fire last month, which was intended to let food aid and other forms of aid in. Did that work? HADI: Two days is not enough. Three days is not enough. One month is not enough. What we need - we need unconditional access to reach the people where they are. I visited health centers. It was horrible. I looked at children lying in beds too sick even to cry, too tired to express their pain. But even next to them I saw mothers who were as in pain as their children, in pain because of seeing their kids sitting there sick, not having the right medical attention, but they themselves are tired. On top of that, when I spoke to those women, what brought you here, how did you come here? Basically they had to borrow money. They had to sell any of their assets just to take a long trip to bring a sick child to a hospital to receive treatment. Honestly, what I witnessed in my own eyes with the team is the worst thing I saw throughout my 25 years career with the World Food Program. SIMON: The United Nations estimates about 21 million people are in danger of not eating. HADI: Absolutely. There are 14 million people in Yemen who are food insecure. Out of the 14 million people, there are 7 million people who are severely food insecure. That means people will have to go and find anything to eat. It goes from even trying to look into a grass to eat. I have seen in my own eyes people looking into garbage trying to get something to eat in Yemen. What we need in Yemen is we need support. First of all, there needs to be an end to this crisis in Yemen. Politicians must do their job. They must find an end to this crisis. At the same time, humanitarians must be supported. We have to support Yemen through food but through other needs. The education must be supported in Yemen because it's obvious now where there is food insecurity, there is no security. And if you combine the lack of security with the lack of education, what do you get? You get a fertile environment for the terrorist organizations to act and to start recruiting the people there and spreading their venom in the head of the children who will then do this horrible suicide bombing and terrorist acts all over the world. The war in Yemen must end. There is a menu of needs that is required by the Yemeni people at different levels, and we must act before it's too late. SIMON: Mr. Hadi, while we have you in our studios this week, I would like to also ask about Syria where the World Food Program has been involved. Government forces have recently been able to push into formerly rebel-held areas of Aleppo. What are you hearing about the situation on the ground there? HADI: The latest reports we received in Syria, Aleppo, even before this latest crisis started, there were no functioning hospitals. The same scenario there. There are kids, children, women looking into garbage trying to find something to eat. But it's not only about eastern Aleppo. It's about anybody in Syria who is in a besieged area. There are about a million people in Syria who are in besieged areas, which we are unable to reach in Syria. Again, we give food to more than 4 million people, but that's not enough. Syria is another country that needs an immediate political solution. There are people just like us in Aleppo sitting under fire knowing that any second probably a bomb or something will land over their heads, and their children will die before them. How could we allow something like this to happen? SIMON: Muhannad Hadi, Middle East regional director for the World Food Program, thanks for being with us. HADI: Thank you, sir.

I'm Shankar Vedantam. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"PANIC IN THE STREETS\")VEDANTAM: In 1950, before he directed the film \"On The Waterfront,\" Elia Kazan made another dramatic thriller, a movie called \"Panic In The Streets. \" There's a reason you probably haven't heard of it. It isn't a great movie. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"PANIC IN THE STREETS\")UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: Herewith recorded is the story of a silent, savage menace. The events, incidents and emotions of the people who were a part of it who found time running out as they looked into the face of mortal peril. VEDANTAM: The film tells the fictional story of a murder in New Orleans. When the police investigate, they find the victim suffered from a deadly infectious disease, a version of the plague. Public health officials believe the killers may have contracted the disease as they carried the victim's body away. What follows is a race to track down the criminals and halt an epidemic, a collision of law enforcement and public health. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"PANIC IN THE STREETS\")RICHARD WIDMARK: (As Lt. Cmdr. Clinton Clint Reed M. D. ) If the killer is incubating pneumonic plague, he can start spreading it within 48 hours. PAUL DOUGLAS: (As Capt. Tom Warren) Forty-eight hours? WIDMARK: (As Lt. Cmdr. Clinton Clint Reed M. D. ) Yes, we have 48 hours. Shortly after that you'll have the makings of an epidemic. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Today on the show, we have a story where life imitates art. It's a story about disease and panic, but it's also a story about psychology. To control an epidemic takes more than medical skill. It requires an understanding of human behavior and the forces that drive people to act in certain ways. Our story starts in Monrovia, the capital of Liberia. A deadly crisis was sparking fear. News reports were filled with dramatic language and catastrophic warnings. (SOUNDBITE OF NEWS MONTAGE)UNIDENTIFIED JOURNALIST #1: The Ebola virus is back, an Ebola break out in West Africa is, quote, \"totally out of control. \"UNIDENTIFIED JOURNALIST #2: A catastrophe is unfolding - the world's deadliest outbreak of Ebola. UNIDENTIFIED JOURNALIST #3: Highly infectious, quick to kill, with no vaccine and no cure. VEDANTAM: The Ebola outbreak reached its peak in the fall of 2014. By the end of the year, it was subsiding. But then in early 2015, in a poor part of Monrovia, there was a new outbreak or cluster. And it led to the complex case we're focusing on today. ATHALIA CHRISTIE: I got a call from someone who said, if your passport isn't in my office in the next two hours, you won't make your flight to Liberia. VEDANTAM: Athalia Christie is an epidemiologist with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC. She flew to Monrovia to help track and stop the outbreak. Lots of CDC officials joined her, like Frank Mahoney. FRANK MAHONEY: People were scared. It was a crisis. You could drive through the city and see people that were being left out on the street, you know, for people to come pick them up. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Frank and Athalia told me how the case we're following today started. Police in Monrovia discovered a body in a warehouse, a young man dead with multiple stab wounds. VEDANTAM: Police were called in. A swab was taken as mandated by the official policy that any dead body be swabbed. So even the police who arrived there initially thought they were investigating a murder, they did follow the procedures and have the bodies swabbed, at which point we were alerted because the test came back positive. VEDANTAM: Positive for Ebola. Once police identified the youth, they quickly realized they had a major problem on their hands. It turned out the young man was actually part of a large street gang. MAHONEY: Yeah, it was like a gang. One of them, for whatever reason, he got stabbed by other members of the group. CHRISTIE: As we understand it, there was a knife fight and we're not quite sure how it happened but the friend turned on him. VEDANTAM: Just to review, a young man contracts Ebola. He gets in a fight and is stabbed repeatedly by fellow members of his gang. Ebola, remember, is highly contagious. Come into contact with an infected person's sweat or blood and you could fall sick, too. The gang had as many as 35 members, each had connections far and wide across the city. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: And just like in that movie, \"Panic In The Streets,\" public health officials needed to quickly stop the outbreak from spreading. They needed to try and find every person who could have come into contact with the young man. It's a process called contact tracing. CHRISTIE: It's exceedingly difficult to do. If you try to imagine constructing the last three weeks of your life and determining every single person that you came into contact with, whether it was casual contact or a family member who you saw every day, it's extraordinarily difficult to do. So we interview people multiple times. And we also talk to their family members and their friends to try to determine everyone who might have had any contact with this person during the time that they could have been infectious. VEDANTAM: Athalia and Frank knew the young man who died had sought medical treatment for his stab wounds. Had a health care worker sutured the young man's wounds and come into contact with his blood? Athalia visited a lot of clinics, trying to track down facilities the young man may have visited. She paged through logbooks of patient names with no luck. Then she got to one clinic. CHRISTIE: And I took this big, dusty log book and I opened it up and literally the page I opened it to, there's maybe 30 names to a page. And I read down them and there he was at the bottom of the first page. VEDANTAM: A health care worker at this clinic had sutured the young man's knife wounds. Athalia knew what she had to do. CHRISTIE: The most difficult part of these investigations come when you need to tell the clinicians and all of the staff who work in these health care facilities that someone with Ebola entered the facility. And I remember how nervous the individual was when I told him that the person he sutured had been positive for Ebola at the time. It's hard to imagine what he was going through. VEDANTAM: Can you recall what you told him and what he said? CHRISTIE: We were standing in the hallway. And I told him that there's no easy way to tell anybody this. And so we just told him very matter of factly and that we needed to maintain daily contact and monitoring with him coming in for treatment the moment that you have symptoms. And the reason I remember this so clearly is that he didn't do that. He was very reluctant to go to an Ebola treatment unit. VEDANTAM: The health care worker refused to be quarantined. He insisted he'd followed all safety procedures as he bandaged the young man's wounds. He told Athalia he'd get in touch if he started to have any symptoms. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Athalia knew there was a reason the health care worker had refused to come into an Ebola treatment unit. It had to do with a lack of trust in the system. In fact, the more Athalia and Frank saw, the more they realized that Ebola wasn't the only enemy they were fighting in Monrovia. They were dealing with an epidemic of mistrust. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: After a long history of civil war and corruption, a lot of people in Liberia simply didn't trust the government or international organizations. When Ebola broke out, the government's first response was to try and control it using coercion, cordoning off sections of towns. It created panic. MAHONEY: The government had attempted involuntary quarantine and they had a really bad experience in the slums of Monrovia. And so we talked about, you know, is this a viable strategy? And we all agreed, no, we can't use involuntary quarantine. This is not something that's going to build trust in the community. It's not a way to manage the outbreak. VEDANTAM: People also worried that if they did go into quarantine, they would never come out. Athalia pointed at the construction of one of the largest Ebola treatment units in Liberia. CHRISTIE: And it was chaotic and difficult. And they built it all and they forgot to put an exit in. They didn't build an exit because we weren't thinking about survivors at that time. And although this was many months later, many people, understandably so, thought that going to an Ebola treatment unit meant that you would not come home. VEDANTAM: Dealing with mistrust, the public health officials knew, was central as they began to trace all the leads of this complex case. As Athalia had been tracking down the health care worker, Frank had been pursuing a different strand of the investigation - tracking down the members of the young man's gang. MAHONEY: This was a community that was not on the best terms with the government, you know, they were very suspicious of the government. CHRISTIE: So it really is a trust-building exercise to go into this community to piece together all these pieces of the story. VEDANTAM: Very quickly Frank and Ophelia realized they were in over their heads. They needed help. MAHONEY: So when we did the investigation, I went with this Liberian. . . CHRISTIE: Fantastic Liberian epidemiologist. . . MAHONEY: . . . Person named Mosoka Fallah. CHRISTIE: . . . Mosoka Fallah. MOSOKA FALLAH: I am Mosoka P. Fallah. VEDANTAM: As a Liberian, Mosoka Fallah understood things far better than the Americans. He also understood the horrors of Ebola firsthand. The disease had killed his sister. Mosoka's first order of business was to help track down the young men in the gang. Surprisingly, they weren't hard to find, but they were scared. Scared that the police, who were still investigating the case as a homicide, would arrest them for their role in the knife fight. FALLAH: The police wanted to go in. However, if we allowed the police to go in, the gangsters would all escape and we'll have pretty close to 35 young men who are all high-risk contact on the loose. VEDANTAM: This is similar to what happened in \"Panic In The Streets. \"(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"PANIC IN THE STREETS\")MAHONEY: (As Capt. Tom Warren) Wait a minute, Neff. Wait a minute. DAN RISS: (As Neff) Wait for what, somebody else to die? FALLAH: Frank suggested that there should be no arrests. VEDANTAM: Mosoka says Frank sat down with the police. He told them that any investigation of the murder would send gang members into hiding and potentially spread Ebola further. VEDANTAM: If you allow the Ebola team to go in and negotiate so that we can have the contact. And the police agreed. And the police withdrew the arrest. And that's how we went in to negotiate. VEDANTAM: And this, everyone told us, is what allowed public health officials to start talking to the young men in the gang. So to recap, public health officials had tracked down the health care worker who treated the young man and identified all the people they could tell the young man had come into contact with. The epidemiologists quickly found themselves staring at a growing web. There were three important strands. First, the young men in the gang would have to be persuaded to enter an Ebola quarantine facility for 21 days. Second, there was a woman running a drug house who was connected to the gang. Gang members were in and out of her home all the time. Most worrisome, the public health officials heard the woman was sick and they thought that she might have Ebola. FALLAH: She had had diarrhea for two days and she was getting sick. VEDANTAM: Finally, there was one member of the gang they could not track down. During the fight, this man had held down the stabbing victim as the blades came out and the blood splattered. And now, Frank and others found, he'd run away. What was his name? MAHONEY: His name, ironically, was Time Bomb. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Coming up, how to stop the outbreak and find Time Bomb. Stay with us. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: This is HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. We're exploring how in early 2015, epidemiologists tried to stop Ebola from spreading in a poor slum in Liberia. They had three fires to put out. Time Bomb had gone underground. The rest of the gang had been identified, but were reluctant to be quarantined. And then there was the woman known as Drug Mama. She was the godmother of a drug den frequented by members of the gang. She was in her 30s and appeared to have symptoms that suggested Ebola. If Ebola struck the heart of the drug den, it would spread very quickly through the community. Frank and Mosoka realized they had to quickly run a test to get Drug Mama diagnosed, but they anticipated problems. FALLAH: Our dilemma was, how do we approach her such that she accepts us to do an Ebola test? VEDANTAM: The mere mention of Ebola was sending people into a panic. If they told her they were worried she had Ebola, would she vanish and go underground? They didn't want to take the chance. So rather than take her into confidence, they decided to trick Drug Mama. It wasn't ideal, but they were dealing with a crisis. They had to improvise. FALLAH: So Frank being the smart guy he is, we stopped at a pharmacy and we bought her malaria medicine. And we went there that night and Frank said, I heard you're not so well so we brought you some medicine. This is around 9 p. m. She said, yes. So Frank said, take this medicine. I will come back tomorrow and check on you. And so the goal was the next morning I asked for her blood to go check if she had malaria and then we'd run an Ebola test. VEDANTAM: The trick worked up to a point. The problem was the next morning when they took Drug Mama to the hospital to get her blood drawn, they had to tell health care workers at the hospital what was going on so everyone would take proper precautions. A nurse got scared when they told her they wanted to test for Ebola. Drug Mama noticed the nurse acting oddly. FALLAH: And then she suspected something else. The Drug Mama left and went back home and became angry with us. VEDANTAM: Mosoka and Frank realized the trickery was backfiring, so they tried bribery. FALLAH: We sat down with her. We negotiated and we told her we'd give her $100 U. S. if she allowed us to do a blood draw at her house. So we took the blood. And at 7 p. m. that night we got a response that she was negative. And we all went to bed breathing a sigh of release. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Frank and Mosoka turned their focus to the second strand in the web - the young men in the gang. Patiently, they explained to the young men that they would be safe from police harassment in the Ebola treatment unit. MAHONEY: We worked it out with them. We made a - we worked out an arrangement where they - if they agreed to come in to the isolation facility, you know, the CDC, I think we ended up paying their families some support costs 'cause they were no longer able to earn money for their families. And the government provided the families with food. And so it worked out really well. VEDANTAM: But even this was not enough. It turned out some of the young men were drug addicts. Frank realized he had to keep asking the government to bend the rules in the Ebola treatment unit or ETU. MAHONEY: I told the government that we had to anticipate that some of these young men may be drug users and they may go into withdrawal if we put them in the ETU. And, in fact, that was the case. About two to three days later they were - some of them getting agitated. And somehow they found a way to support their needs for drugs. VEDANTAM: Did you have to do some of that to help them get what they needed to keep them in this facility where they could be quarantined? MAHONEY: No. I - the CDC didn't pay for that or do that. But the government found a way for the communities to support them so they were doing that. VEDANTAM: So - in - but in some ways it's sort of an awkward situation for the government because in some ways you're asking. . . MAHONEY: Exactly. VEDANTAM: . . . The government to sort of look the other way while someone's doing something illegal here. MAHONEY: Yeah. I think that they - but at the same they - it'd be like any withdrawal. They needed treatment. It wasn't a conventional treatment, that's for sure. VEDANTAM: It was odd for public health officials to be sanctioning illegal drug use. But again, when you're in the middle of an unfolding catastrophe, you sometimes have to bend the rules. Even though CDC wasn't actually supplying anyone drugs, the arrangement produced lots of double takes. One day a Liberian government minister turned to Frank during a discussion and joked about the back door drug channel. MAHONEY: And (laughter) he says, and I understand that CDC is providing them with the marijuana. And I said excuse me, sir, I said I'd like to correct that. I said CDC is not providing the marijuana, that - but we're providing the cocaine. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Incredibly, the epidemiologists actually managed to quarantine the gang members. These were young men who no one thought would listen to the authorities. But by reposing trust in them and treating the young men as partners, the public health officials had found a solution that seemed to work better than coercion or trickery. Still, this wasn't the end. There was a third strand of the web they had to track down - Time Bomb. FALLAH: Time Bomb became very elusive. We could not find Time Bomb. VEDANTAM: At first, gang members did not want to tell Mosoka or Frank where Time Bomb was. FALLAH: But as we built friendship and rapport with the other criminals, one of them took us to his house. VEDANTAM: There they found a young man, a young woman and a baby. The epidemiologists asked the young man if he was Time Bomb. FALLAH: He said, I'm not Time Bomb. Time Bomb is gone out. I'm his younger brother. But if he comes back, I will let you know. Then I said, OK, thank you very much. VEDANTAM: It was at this point that Mosoka and Frank did something very kind and very wise that led to a breakthrough in the case. FALLAH: The wife had a young baby. And I remember giving the wife a hundred dollars and said, go ahead and buy milk for the baby. Feed the baby and we'll take care of you. VEDANTAM: Something changed in the young man's demeanor. FALLAH: After I did that, he turned to me and said to me, I am Time Bomb. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: Frank and Mosoka told Time Bomb and his wife that they would be back that night. They promised they would return with more food. FALLAH: Frank came to me with the food and said, Mosoka, we need to go to meet this guy. This was in the ghetto. MAHONEY: I went with Mosoka and it was like 10 o'clock at night. FALLAH: There was no electricity. This place was pitch black. We had to go and drive through the grass. This is - was like a slum community. It's known to have gangsters. And that's what Frank was emphasizing, that we had to keep our word. They had to trust us. VEDANTAM: This was the key. MAHONEY: So we brought food to him and his family, I think a couple sacks of rice and things. FALLAH: As walked towards them and they saw us coming with rice on our shoulder, for some reason they trusted us and they came to the car and helped us take the rice. VEDANTAM: Frank and Mosoka gently asked Time Bomb whether he was willing to come to the Ebola treatment facility to be quarantined. Time Bomb said he wasn't ready to do that. Frank and Mosoka said they understood, that they were willing to trust him to do the right thing. FALLAH: If you get sick, you call us. And he said, I will do that. I trust you guys. MAHONEY: And so I think it was a matter of building up a trust and comfort level for him to talk to us. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: In the end, none of the young gang members contracted Ebola, not even Time Bomb. The cluster did not spread in the ghetto. Drug Mama recovered from her illness. Only one person connected with the cluster was affected. The medical worker who'd sutured up the young man's wounds, the one that went into hiding after Athalia talked to him, he came down with Ebola-related symptoms. Eventually he did seek treatment, but it was too late. CHRISTIE: He died unfortunately in the Ebola treatment unit. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: We started today's episode with the 1950 movie \"Panic In The Streets. \" At the end of that movie, the hero - a public health worker - ends up in a warehouse with the criminals who are carrying the deadly plague. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"PANIC IN THE STREETS\")WIDMARK: (As Lt. Cmdr. Clinton Clint Reed M. D. ) I'm a doctor and I can cure you. VEDANTAM: He pleads for them to hand over their guns. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"PANIC IN THE STREETS\")WIDMARK: (As Lt. Cmdr. Clinton Clint Reed M. D. ) Come out now and surrender and I promise nothing will happen to you. VEDANTAM: But. . . (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"PANIC IN THE STREETS,\" GUNSHOTS HEARD)VEDANTAM: . . . They get into a climactic shootout and the criminals are killed. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"PANIC IN THE STREETS,\" GUNSHOTS HEARD)VEDANTAM: The public health workers in Liberia never solved things with guns. And really, when it came down to it, Athalia says, they achieved some of their best results without coercion or trickery. Building those invisible but very real bonds of trust took time, but it was essential to stopping an outbreak. CHRISTIE: When it comes down to what we were asking people to do, either to trust the health care system or to trust the government enough to agree to this voluntary precautionary isolation, that's an extraordinarily difficult thing to do. You're asking people to leave their friends and family for 21 days. Or we were asking people to change their burial customs. And it's difficult. It can sound simple. And I know that I spoke to people here who would say, I don't understand, why can't they just change the way they bury the dead or change the way they care for their family members if they're sick? But as a mother, I can't imagine not touching my child if he was sick and not trying to provide comfort. So it's really understanding what it is that's that's driving people. You have to understand their contexts, their concerns and their needs. I think it's about interpersonal relationships. You have to be honest and straightforward about what you need and why. And most importantly, I think you need to be human. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VEDANTAM: This episode of HIDDEN BRAIN was produced by Chris Benderev and edited by Tara Boyle and Jenny Schmidt.

He's Tom Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. He got in touch some time ago to say he loved the show, but wanted to know why we weren't doing more stories about public health. I told him those stories tended to be a little dry. He said, wait a minute, I've got a great one for you. Tom, you were right, this was a great story. If you have an idea for a HIDDEN BRAIN, episode a topic with interesting ideas and great characters, drop us a line at hiddenbrain. npr. org. I'm Shankar Vedantam and this is NPR. SHANKAR VEDANTAM, HOST:  This is HIDDEN BRAIN. I'm Shankar Vedantam. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"PANIC IN THE STREETS\") VEDANTAM: In 1950, before he directed the film \"On The Waterfront,\" Elia Kazan made another dramatic thriller, a movie called \"Panic In The Streets. \" There's a reason you probably haven't heard of it. It isn't a great movie. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"PANIC IN THE STREETS\") UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: Herewith recorded is the story of a silent, savage menace. The events, incidents and emotions of the people who were a part of it who found time running out as they looked into the face of mortal peril. VEDANTAM: The film tells the fictional story of a murder in New Orleans. When the police investigate, they find the victim suffered from a deadly infectious disease, a version of the plague. Public health officials believe the killers may have contracted the disease as they carried the victim's body away. What follows is a race to track down the criminals and halt an epidemic, a collision of law enforcement and public health. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"PANIC IN THE STREETS\") RICHARD WIDMARK: (As Lt. Cmdr. Clinton Clint Reed M. D. ) If the killer is incubating pneumonic plague, he can start spreading it within 48 hours. PAUL DOUGLAS: (As Capt. Tom Warren) Forty-eight hours? WIDMARK: (As Lt. Cmdr. Clinton Clint Reed M. D. ) Yes, we have 48 hours. Shortly after that you'll have the makings of an epidemic. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Today on the show, we have a story where life imitates art. It's a story about disease and panic, but it's also a story about psychology. To control an epidemic takes more than medical skill. It requires an understanding of human behavior and the forces that drive people to act in certain ways. Our story starts in Monrovia, the capital of Liberia. A deadly crisis was sparking fear. News reports were filled with dramatic language and catastrophic warnings. (SOUNDBITE OF NEWS MONTAGE) UNIDENTIFIED JOURNALIST #1: The Ebola virus is back, an Ebola break out in West Africa is, quote, \"totally out of control. \" UNIDENTIFIED JOURNALIST #2: A catastrophe is unfolding - the world's deadliest outbreak of Ebola. UNIDENTIFIED JOURNALIST #3: Highly infectious, quick to kill, with no vaccine and no cure. VEDANTAM: The Ebola outbreak reached its peak in the fall of 2014. By the end of the year, it was subsiding. But then in early 2015, in a poor part of Monrovia, there was a new outbreak or cluster. And it led to the complex case we're focusing on today. ATHALIA CHRISTIE: I got a call from someone who said, if your passport isn't in my office in the next two hours, you won't make your flight to Liberia. VEDANTAM: Athalia Christie is an epidemiologist with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC. She flew to Monrovia to help track and stop the outbreak. Lots of CDC officials joined her, like Frank Mahoney. FRANK MAHONEY: People were scared. It was a crisis. You could drive through the city and see people that were being left out on the street, you know, for people to come pick them up. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Frank and Athalia told me how the case we're following today started. Police in Monrovia discovered a body in a warehouse, a young man dead with multiple stab wounds. VEDANTAM: Police were called in. A swab was taken as mandated by the official policy that any dead body be swabbed. So even the police who arrived there initially thought they were investigating a murder, they did follow the procedures and have the bodies swabbed, at which point we were alerted because the test came back positive. VEDANTAM: Positive for Ebola. Once police identified the youth, they quickly realized they had a major problem on their hands. It turned out the young man was actually part of a large street gang. MAHONEY: Yeah, it was like a gang. One of them, for whatever reason, he got stabbed by other members of the group. CHRISTIE: As we understand it, there was a knife fight and we're not quite sure how it happened but the friend turned on him. VEDANTAM: Just to review, a young man contracts Ebola.

Come into contact with an infected person's sweat or blood and you could fall sick, too. The gang had as many as 35 members, each had connections far and wide across the city.

A nurse got scared when they told her they wanted to test for Ebola. Drug Mama noticed the nurse acting oddly. FALLAH: And then she suspected something else. The Drug Mama left and went back home and became angry with us. VEDANTAM: Mosoka and Frank realized the trickery was backfiring, so they tried bribery. FALLAH: We sat down with her. We negotiated and we told her we'd give her $100 U. S. if she allowed us to do a blood draw at her house. So we took the blood. And at 7 p. m. that night we got a response that she was negative. And we all went to bed breathing a sigh of release. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Frank and Mosoka turned their focus to the second strand in the web - the young men in the gang. Patiently, they explained to the young men that they would be safe from police harassment in the Ebola treatment unit. MAHONEY: We worked it out with them. We made a - we worked out an arrangement where they - if they agreed to come in to the isolation facility, you know, the CDC, I think we ended up paying their families some support costs 'cause they were no longer able to earn money for their families. And the government provided the families with food. And so it worked out really well. VEDANTAM: But even this was not enough. It turned out some of the young men were drug addicts. Frank realized he had to keep asking the government to bend the rules in the Ebola treatment unit or ETU. MAHONEY: I told the government that we had to anticipate that some of these young men may be drug users and they may go into withdrawal if we put them in the ETU. And, in fact, that was the case. About two to three days later they were - some of them getting agitated. And somehow they found a way to support their needs for drugs. VEDANTAM: Did you have to do some of that to help them get what they needed to keep them in this facility where they could be quarantined? MAHONEY: No. I - the CDC didn't pay for that or do that. But the government found a way for the communities to support them so they were doing that. VEDANTAM: So - in - but in some ways it's sort of an awkward situation for the government because in some ways you're asking. . . MAHONEY: Exactly. VEDANTAM: . . . The government to sort of look the other way while someone's doing something illegal here. MAHONEY: Yeah. I think that they - but at the same they - it'd be like any withdrawal. They needed treatment. It wasn't a conventional treatment, that's for sure. VEDANTAM: It was odd for public health officials to be sanctioning illegal drug use. But again, when you're in the middle of an unfolding catastrophe, you sometimes have to bend the rules. Even though CDC wasn't actually supplying anyone drugs, the arrangement produced lots of double takes. One day a Liberian government minister turned to Frank during a discussion and joked about the back door drug channel. MAHONEY: And (laughter) he says, and I understand that CDC is providing them with the marijuana. And I said excuse me, sir, I said I'd like to correct that. I said CDC is not providing the marijuana, that - but we're providing the cocaine. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Incredibly, the epidemiologists actually managed to quarantine the gang members. These were young men who no one thought would listen to the authorities. But by reposing trust in them and treating the young men as partners, the public health officials had found a solution that seemed to work better than coercion or trickery. Still, this wasn't the end. There was a third strand of the web they had to track down - Time Bomb. FALLAH: Time Bomb became very elusive. We could not find Time Bomb. VEDANTAM: At first, gang members did not want to tell Mosoka or Frank where Time Bomb was. FALLAH: But as we built friendship and rapport with the other criminals, one of them took us to his house. VEDANTAM: There they found a young man, a young woman and a baby. The epidemiologists asked the young man if he was Time Bomb. FALLAH: He said, I'm not Time Bomb. Time Bomb is gone out. I'm his younger brother. But if he comes back, I will let you know. Then I said, OK, thank you very much. VEDANTAM: It was at this point that Mosoka and Frank did something very kind and very wise that led to a breakthrough in the case. FALLAH: The wife had a young baby. And I remember giving the wife a hundred dollars and said, go ahead and buy milk for the baby. Feed the baby and we'll take care of you. VEDANTAM: Something changed in the young man's demeanor. FALLAH: After I did that, he turned to me and said to me, I am Time Bomb. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: Frank and Mosoka told Time Bomb and his wife that they would be back that night. They promised they would return with more food. FALLAH: Frank came to me with the food and said, Mosoka, we need to go to meet this guy. This was in the ghetto. MAHONEY: I went with Mosoka and it was like 10 o'clock at night. FALLAH: There was no electricity. This place was pitch black. We had to go and drive through the grass. This is - was like a slum community. It's known to have gangsters. And that's what Frank was emphasizing, that we had to keep our word. They had to trust us. VEDANTAM: This was the key. MAHONEY: So we brought food to him and his family, I think a couple sacks of rice and things. FALLAH: As walked towards them and they saw us coming with rice on our shoulder, for some reason they trusted us and they came to the car and helped us take the rice. VEDANTAM: Frank and Mosoka gently asked Time Bomb whether he was willing to come to the Ebola treatment facility to be quarantined. Time Bomb said he wasn't ready to do that. Frank and Mosoka said they understood, that they were willing to trust him to do the right thing. FALLAH: If you get sick, you call us. And he said, I will do that. I trust you guys. MAHONEY: And so I think it was a matter of building up a trust and comfort level for him to talk to us. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: In the end, none of the young gang members contracted Ebola, not even Time Bomb. The cluster did not spread in the ghetto. Drug Mama recovered from her illness. Only one person connected with the cluster was affected. The medical worker who'd sutured up the young man's wounds, the one that went into hiding after Athalia talked to him, he came down with Ebola-related symptoms. Eventually he did seek treatment, but it was too late. CHRISTIE: He died unfortunately in the Ebola treatment unit. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: We started today's episode with the 1950 movie \"Panic In The Streets. \" At the end of that movie, the hero - a public health worker - ends up in a warehouse with the criminals who are carrying the deadly plague. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"PANIC IN THE STREETS\") WIDMARK: (As Lt. Cmdr. Clinton Clint Reed M. D. ) I'm a doctor and I can cure you. VEDANTAM: He pleads for them to hand over their guns. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"PANIC IN THE STREETS\") WIDMARK: (As Lt. Cmdr. Clinton Clint Reed M. D. ) Come out now and surrender and I promise nothing will happen to you. VEDANTAM: But. . . (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"PANIC IN THE STREETS,\" GUNSHOTS HEARD) VEDANTAM: . . . They get into a climactic shootout and the criminals are killed. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"PANIC IN THE STREETS,\" GUNSHOTS HEARD) VEDANTAM: The public health workers in Liberia never solved things with guns. And really, when it came down to it, Athalia says, they achieved some of their best results without coercion or trickery. Building those invisible but very real bonds of trust took time, but it was essential to stopping an outbreak. CHRISTIE: When it comes down to what we were asking people to do, either to trust the health care system or to trust the government enough to agree to this voluntary precautionary isolation, that's an extraordinarily difficult thing to do. You're asking people to leave their friends and family for 21 days. Or we were asking people to change their burial customs. And it's difficult. It can sound simple. And I know that I spoke to people here who would say, I don't understand, why can't they just change the way they bury the dead or change the way they care for their family members if they're sick? But as a mother, I can't imagine not touching my child if he was sick and not trying to provide comfort. So it's really understanding what it is that's that's driving people. You have to understand their contexts, their concerns and their needs. I think it's about interpersonal relationships. You have to be honest and straightforward about what you need and why. And most importantly, I think you need to be human. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VEDANTAM: This episode of HIDDEN BRAIN was produced by Chris Benderev and edited by Tara Boyle and Jenny Schmidt.

He got in touch some time ago to say he loved the show, but wanted to know why we weren't doing more stories about public health. I told him those stories tended to be a little dry. He said, wait a minute, I've got a great one for you. Tom, you were right, this was a great story.

S. -China relations from a journalist who's made a study of how the two countries have dealt with each other since the 1700s. After winning the election, Donald Trump took a phone call from the president of Taiwan, and that broke with 40 years of U. S. policy. It raised questions about whether Trump will continue the One China Policy, the idea that Taiwan and mainland China - the People's Republic of China - are part of the same country and that Washington recognizes the government in Beijing as the government of that country. Trump fueled speculation by talking about that on Fox News over the weekend. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)DONALD TRUMP: I don't know why we have to be bound by One China Policy unless we make a deal with China. SIEGEL: And he mentioned trade, monetary policy and claims to the South China Sea as issues in need of a possible deal. Well, if the U. S. were to turn away from the One China Policy, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said the healthy, stable development of China-U. S. relations would be out of the question. John Pomfret, who covered China for The Washington Post, has written a new book called \"The Beautiful Country And The Middle Kingdom\" about America and China, and he joins us from San Francisco. Welcome to the program. JOHN POMFRET: Thanks for having me. SIEGEL: How important is the One China Policy to U. S. -China relations? POMFRET: It's this fiction that has undergirded the relationship between the two sides since they re-engaged in the 1970s. It's extremely important. SIEGEL: The fiction being that Taiwan, which is a de facto independent state, is not. It's part of China. POMFRET: Right. And there's a fiction that the United States sort of agrees with China on the status of Taiwan. SIEGEL: You describe all kinds of cycles and policies and attitudes in the U. S. toward China. Is what Donald Trump just did - is it out of line with what recent statements have been? POMFRET: Recent statements for sure, but there is a strain in America's views of China that believes that the United States has been way too supportive of the Chinese, should be impatient with China, should confront China head on. So he does fall with - he's not an outlier in his views on China from the historic perspective. There is a radical American approach to China, and he seems to be embracing that right now. SIEGEL: I've been asking about the relationship between Washington and Beijing, but on the other side is the relationship between Washington and Taiwan. They claim to be the government of China. That's pretty fictitious at this point. But if they went independent, that would blow the fiction out of the waters. POMFRET: Exactly, and that's the danger. It's part of the danger of Donald Trump's referring to Taiwan's president as the president of Taiwan as if there was a real state of Taiwan. Now, in fact there is, but the fiction is to say there's not. And that's one of the things that has kept the peace in Asia by maintaining this fiction. And so if you pull that out and if you basically say the emperor has no clothes, you run the risk of pushing China into a much more aggressive posture vis-a-vis Taiwan. At the end of the day, I don't particularly worry about a war between the United States and China right now, but I really worry that this will give people in the Mainland China a justification to squeeze Taiwan even more than it's already squeezing Taiwan. At the end of the day, I just worry that once again Taiwan's going to be thrown under the bus. SIEGEL: Your book covers almost two and a half centuries of U. S. -China dealings. And one point that you make is that while we may have heard a lot over time about one country taking advantage over the other country, the truth is that each country - China and the U. S. - has been very important in the other's growth and development. POMFRET: Exactly. Basically the founding fortunes of the United States were made on the basis of very productive and lucrative trade with China. And that money in turn was invested and formed the basis for the American industrial revolution. From the Chinese perspective as well, their first touches with modern education, modern technology came in contact with the United States. And the United States became a key factor in the whole modernization of China. All of the major Chinese universities today basically were initially founded by Western missionaries. SIEGEL: And of course there were lots of Chinese who were tapped to go study at American universities and who went back to become leaders of China. POMFRET: Exactly. In fact, the foundation of an example would be China's nuclear bomb program in the 1950s. Those students and those researchers actually had come from the United States and returned to China to help China build its bomb. SIEGEL: Another recurring point that you make in your book, whether it's about missionaries or journalists or policymakers, is that Americans have a terrible track record of misunderstanding China. What is it that we typically just don't get about the Chinese? POMFRET: I think partially because we considered ourselves to be the apex of the West, and the Chinese consider themselves. And we basically look at them as the apex of the East. We have often a powerfully emotive, romantic notion that we'll be able to form some type of unified sort of position on the world and then together solve the world's problems. We also believe that because of our friendship toward China and our warm feelings toward China, that naturally they will want to become more like us, and that has been a bet that Americans have been making since the 1840s. (Laughter) And in many cases, it really hasn't played out that way. SIEGEL: More like us might have been Protestant like most Americans or might have been more Democratic, more open. POMFRET: Exactly - or more capitalist. I mean all these bets that have been made - and this is not something that just started in the 1970s. This is something that goes way back into our history. And in many cases, it just hasn't turned out that way. SIEGEL: John Pomfret, author of \"The Beautiful Country And The Middle Kingdom\" - it's a book about America and China - thanks for talking with us today. POMFRET: Thank you for having me.

It's the largest deal made by a U. S. companies since international sanctions were lifted on Iran earlier this year. President-elect Donald Trump says he wants to derail the nuclear agreement that makes such deals possible. NPR's Jackie Northam reports. JACKIE NORTHAM, BYLINE: The deal involves the sale of 80 commercial aircraft. It's a mix of single-aisle and wide-body extended-range jets, including the best-selling version of the 777. In a statement, Boeing was careful to note the company worked closely with the U. S. government to secure a license to sell to Iran. And that the deal would affect Boeing's vendors and suppliers across the country. Gordon Johndroe is a spokesman for Boeing. GORDON JOHNDROE: Today's agreement will support tens of thousands of U. S. jobs directly associated with the production and delivery of the Boeing 777 and nearly 100,000 U. S. jobs in the U. S. aerospace supply chain. NORTHAM: Even before the ink was dry, there was speculation whether the deal would fall apart. Richard Aboulafia, an analyst with the Teal Group, an aerospace consultancy, says there are multiple risks involved with the sale. RICHARD ABOULAFIA: First of all, the ability of Iran to actually finance the large and ambitious jet purchase is highly suspect given oil prices and given the difficulty in lining up third-party finance. NORTHAM: Aboulafia says the bigger risk is just surviving President-elect Trump, who has called the Iran nuclear agreement signed by six world powers a disaster and the worst deal ever negotiated. But without the Iran nuclear agreement, sanctions would have prevented the Boeing deal from ever happening. Aboulafia says Trump will have to decide if he wants to renegotiate the nuclear agreement, cancel it or let the Boeing sale go ahead. ABOULAFIA: I mean, on the one hand he has a fondness for red meat for the base, which means move against trade, move against Iran. On the other hand, jobs, jobs, jobs. There's absolutely no way of telling how this will play out. NORTHAM: Matthew McInnis, an Iran specialist at the American Enterprise Institute - AEI, says House Republicans are already trying to block the deal. He says a lot will depend on who Trump chooses to surround him, especially as secretary of state. MATTHEW MCINNIS: I think President-elect Trump is going to find he's dealing with a lot of very negative perspectives on the deal. I mean, he has a lot of people around him reminding him there's a lot of bad stuff in this deal and the Iranians are still up to a lot of no good in the region. NORTHAM: If Trump does decide to renegotiate or unravel the Iran deal, it could be a boon for Boeing's fiercest competitor - Airbus. Iran has already announced it plans to buy $27 billion worth of aircraft from the France-based company. AEI's McInnis says Boeing has an army of lobbyists in Washington ready to press its case. He says the aircraft manufacturer is trying to establish a long-term stake in Iran, that the deal for new jetliners is as much a political arrangement as it is an economic arrangement for both sides. MCINNIS: A key part of the Iranian strategy, you know, is to build that relationship with Boeing because they see that relationship as crucial for, you know, having that - a very strong voice inside Washington.

S. election. The president made those remarks yesterday at the White House, which he leaves just over a month from now. He was in the Cabinet Room, where many past presidents have considered decisions about peace and war. In our conversation, the president addressed the hacking of the Democratic National Committee and other targets. U. S. intelligence agencies have blamed Russia. President-elect Trump has rejected their findings. The current president seemed to have no doubts, though there is the question of how much difference the stolen information really made. Did the Russian hack of the Democratic National Committee and other targets actually affect the results of the election in your view? PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: There's no doubt that it contributed to an atmosphere. . . INSKEEP: An atmosphere, he said, clouded by many political distractions. The president contends the release of hacked emails from the Democratic Party and Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman were among those distractions. OBAMA: That whole swirl that ended up dominating the news meant that, No. 1, issues weren't talked about a lot in the coverage. Huge policy differences were not debated and vetted. It also meant that what I think would have been a big advantage for Hillary objectively - her experience, her knowledge, her outstanding reputation around the world as secretary of state - all that stuff got lost. And I think in that scrum - in that swirl, you know, Donald Trump and his celebrity and his ability to garner attention and obviously tap into a lot of the anxieties and fears that some voters have, I think, definitely made a difference. This - how. . . INSKEEP: Did you say the election could have turned out differently? That's what I want to know. OBAMA: Well, elections can always turn out differently. You never know which factors are going to make a difference. But I have no doubt that it had some impact just based on the coverage. And, by the way, I'm talking about mainstream news coverage. I'm not talking about a whole separate set of issues around fake news. I'm talking about what was in The New York Times and The Washington Post and on the nightly news and even on NPR. INSKEEP: Was that the media's fault for focusing on the wrong things or the candidate's fault for not finding ways to get her message through? OBAMA: Steve, you know, I'd say that Monday morning quarterbacking's always easy to do. And what I've said already publicly - and I'll repeat - there is something about our current political ecosystem - and we're all a part of it - the parties, the candidates, the media, the voters - that leads us to avoid going deep into the issues that are really going to affect people's day-to-day lives. INSKEEP: You talked about this with the comedian Trevor Noah the other day. And you said a number of things in a row. You observed that there had been contacts between members of Mr. Trump's staff and Russian officials. You noted that Trump benefited from the hacks. Your spokesman, Josh Earnest, has gone on to say this week that it's obvious that Trump knew what was going on. To what extent are you suggesting some kind of cooperation between the president-elect and Russian officials here? OBAMA: I'm not suggesting cooperation at all. Keep in mind that those statements were in the context of everyone now acting surprised by the CIA assessment that this was done purposely to improve Trump's chances. And my only point was, that shouldn't be treated as a blockbuster (laughter) because that was the worst kept secret in this town. Everybody understood that. It was reported on. INSKEEP: Now, the president did not say exactly what he thinks Russian President Vladimir Putin's motives were. He's waiting for a formal report from intelligence agencies. But he notes that the United States publicly blamed Russia for the hacks back in October, and he says Trump's campaign understood the hacks were helping him. OBAMA: When you combine that with the fact that the president-elect has been very honest about his admiration for Putin and that he hopes to forge a more cooperative relationship with him and focus on the threat of Islamic terrorism, then my only point was we shouldn't now suddenly act as if this is a huge revelation. INSKEEP: Is it necessary for the security of the United States that Russia pay some price for doing this - if, as they said - as you said, they did it. OBAMA: I think there is no doubt that when any foreign government tries to impact the integrity of our elections that we need to take action - and we will - at a time in place of our own choosing. Some of it may be explicit and publicized. Some of it may not be. But Mr. Putin is well aware of my feelings about this because I spoke to him directly about it. And there is a - among the big powers, there has been a traditional understanding of - that everybody's trying to gather intelligence on everybody else. It's no secret that Russian intelligence officers or Chinese or, for that matter, Israeli or British or other intelligence agencies - that their job is to get insight into the workings of other countries that they're not reading in the newspapers every day. There's a difference between that and the kind of malicious cyberattacks that steal trade secrets or engage in industrial espionage, something that we've seen the Chinese do. And there's a difference between that and activating intelligence in a way that's designed to influence elections. So we have been working hard to make sure that what we do is proportional, that what we do is meaningful. One of the things that we're going to have to do over the next decade is to ultimately arrive at some rules of what is a new game, and that is the way in which traditional propaganda and traditional covert influence efforts are being turbocharged by the internet and by the cyberworld. INSKEEP: If whatever response you take is not completed by January 20, do you have any reason to have confidence that President Trump will continue it? OBAMA: My view is that this is not a partisan issue. And part of what we should be doing is to try to take it out of election season and move it into governing season. INSKEEP: The president knows that's tricky, though, since surveys show some Republican voters have warmed to Putin as Trump has campaigned. OBAMA: Think about that. Over a third (laughter) of Republican voters think Putin's a good guy. This is somebody - the former head of the KGB who is responsible for crushing democracy in Russia, muzzling the press, throwing political dissidents in jail, countering American efforts to expand freedom at every turn, is currently making decisions that's leading to a slaughter in Syria. And a big chunk of the Republican Party, which prided itself during the Reagan era and for decades that followed as being the bulwark against Russian influence, now suddenly is embracing him. INSKEEP: It sounds like you hope any response would continue after January 20. But do you have any reason to know that it would? OBAMA: Well, I - you know, I can't. . . INSKEEP: Is that - yeah. . . OBAMA: . . . Look into my crystal ball. And that's probably a question better directed to the president-elect. I can say that I've had a conversation with the president-elect about our foreign policy generally. INSKEEP: And Obama says he told Trump about something he believes the next president must preserve. OBAMA: Even our adversaries generally respect our adherence to rule of law, our transparency, our openness. And if we start losing that - if other countries start saying that, well, America doesn't care about these issues or it's just a might-makes-right environment and we're not speaking out on behalf of our values and demonstrating our values, then America's going to be significantly weakened.

He's the head of the International Rescue Committee and a former foreign secretary in Britain. Welcome to the program. DAVID MILIBAND: Thanks very much. CORNISH: Now, the International Rescue Committee has teams in Idlib, and this is where many of the people who fled Aleppo are going. And what are you hearing from your people on the ground there? MILIBAND: We've seen thousands of people - civilians - fleeing, some of them injured in the battle. And they are speaking of real terror because the house-to-house murder that the United Nations talked about - that's what these people have seen and experienced. CORNISH: And these are reports that militias loyal to Syria's president are going house to house to attack what they believe to be rebel homes? MILIBAND: That's exactly right. And what we see in numbers that are dozens when it comes to civilian deaths and thousands who have been strong-armed to join the Assad army are really reports that violate all the most fundamental basics of international humanitarian law, never mind the essential elements that would be necessary for peace to be restored in Syria because the way wars are won affects whether or not peace can follow. And so we as an international humanitarian organization are trying to hold people's lives together in frankly some of the worst circumstances that we've ever seen. CORNISH: You know, fleeing Aleppo doesn't necessarily mean escaping this war, right? Idlib is a rebel-held area. What are your concerns about the fight just moving there? MILIBAND: Obviously, the great fear is that the tactics that have been used in Aleppo and which tragically seem to be deemed successful by the Syrian government and their Russian and Iranian supporters - that those tactics, which combine, on the one hand, mass bombing from the air, are destroying hospitals and civilian centers. My own organization has had eight of our hospitals destroyed across Syria in bombing raids over the last year. That bombing from the air is then combined with two other factors that are utterly merciless. One is the siege tactics to prevent food and medical supplies getting in. And then the second is the house-to-house cold-blooded murder that's been reported over the last 72 hours. And so there is enormous fear in Idlib that the - exactly the wrong lesson will be learned from the Aleppo tragedy. CORNISH: One thing you have said is - you've said that we cannot say we don't know what's happening when the victims themselves are tweeting and sending messages out about the horrors that they face. Do you - are you hearing silence from the international community in the face of those cries? MILIBAND: Well, I think that there's certainly division in the international community. There's fragmentation of the voice, and there is frankly impotence from the top of the international system because of the division between Russia and its Syrian allies on the one hand and Western countries on the other. And I think it's very important that we're all witnesses to this tragedy. And at the moment, the danger is that we perceived by the Syrian civilians as being utterly enfeebled in helping them. CORNISH: With this fall of anti-government forces in Aleppo, what are the prospects of getting back to the negotiating table? Is that kind of faded altogether? MILIBAND: I think it's really important to remember that the end of every war involves some kind of political settlement. And wars are only settled in a durable way when there is a credible and legitimate sharing of power. In Syria, the political dimension has got to come into play. And frankly, the big players are going to be the Russians and the Iranians, and no one yet knows how they're going to play their cards. Are they going to seek to do in Idlib and in the southwest of the country what they've done in Aleppo, or are they now going to sue for peace? And I think that the stories of the bloodbath that happened in Aleppo can only raise the fear that, far from ending the war, we're going to see sporadic outbreaks of fighting across the country on a continuous basis. And that is dangerous both for Syrians, but frankly also for close allies of the United States next door, like Jordan, and also for Europeans, who are suffering now the waves of refugees are still coming despite the winter months.

This long war has claimed the lives of more than half a million people and displaced about half of Syria's population. It's being called one of the great tragedies of the century.

He's author of \"In The Lion's Den: An Eyewitness Account of Washington's Battle With Syria,\" and he's with us now from his home office in the Washington, D. C. -area. Mr. Tabler, thanks so much for speaking with us. ANDREW TABLER: Pleasure to be with you. MARTIN: So why is the fate of Aleppo considered to be such a turning point in the conflict? And do you think that it is? TABLER: It is a turning point. Aleppo is Syria's largest city. The rebels had taken over half of it in the summer of 2012. And controlling a major city in Syria was very important for the rebellion. And their attempt to hold it these last few years became sort of the heart of the revolution in many ways, particularly in the western part of the country. And the taking of Aleppo by the regime is a major setback for the rebels, but it's not going to end the war. MARTIN: It's not. Why not? TABLER: Well, two-thirds of Syrian territory is outside of Bashar al-Assad's control. Most famously, we have the eastern part of Syria, which is controlled by ISIS, but many of the rebel groups control areas in the northwest, the south. In the northeast, the Kurds and also other Arab tribes control other areas. So Syria's still a fragmented country, and Bashar al-Assad simply just does not have the troops to rapidly retake all those areas. So while Aleppo fell, and it's a victory for Assad, it is not the end of the war. And the dangers that have come out of the Syrian war for Syrians and those in the region and all over the world continue. MARTIN: Many people will have heard President Obama's press conference. The president was defending his position or his efforts to seek a diplomatic solution as opposed to using force. How do you think history's going to look back on the president's decisions here? TABLER: I think history's going to look very poorly on the president's decisions. By any measure, Syria's a humanitarian disaster, the largest since the Second World War. But, you know, to people like in the hometown that I'm from in Pennsylvania, the two things that really are going to continue driving this home and showing that President Obama's policy was a failure is the combined threat of terrorism and that of migrants that are coming out of this fragmented and broken country. And when these two streams crossed, they came to loosen up and to damage the societies throughout Europe that had been allies with the United States since the Second World War, brought Russia to the fore in the Middle East and even inspired, in the case of ISIS, a number of lone wolf attacks in the United States. And the war's not over. So I think that it's a stretch for President Obama to declare his Syria policy the best that we could have done. MARTIN: What do you see as the next steps here, particularly given the incoming Trump administration's perceived closeness to the Russians? TABLER: Right. I would imagine you're going to see two things. One is I would imagine a Trump administration will resurrect or implement what's called the Joint Implementation Group agreement, which was signed in late August and early September of this year but was not implemented when the U. S. accidentally bombed the regime position in the eastern part of Syria and then the Russians bombed an aid convoy coming into Aleppo. It's a quid pro quo. The U. S. agrees to target terrorist groups in Syria with Russia and synchronize their missions in exchange for aid deliveries to the opposition. They might have better luck doing that. So that's the first step. The second step could be, and this would be more controversial, the cutting off of covert aid program to the Syrian rebels. President-elect Trump has been critical of that. That would deny the rebels at least some U. S. military equipment. But cutting off that program would also deny the U. S. vital intelligence on those groups that are throughout Syria and could lead to unintended consequences for our intelligence gathering. MARTIN: That's Andrew Tabler.

Lucian, thanks so much for joining us. LUCIAN KIM, BYLINE: Great to be with you, Michel. MARTIN: Donald Trump seems to have much warmer feelings toward Russian President Vladimir Putin than any recent administration. He says he wants better relations. So do you think this might be the moment where that could actually occur? KIM: Well, first of all, I think it's important to remember that George W. Bush also famously looked into Putin's eyes when he came into office. And then eight years later, Obama had the reset. I think Trump is going to realize pretty quickly that the U. S. has obligations to its allies, and many of those allies are afraid of Putin. And so you're right. Trump has suggested that he can make a deal. But I think he's also going to learn that Putin, you know, single-mindedly pursues his goals no matter what the U. S. says. MARTIN: Why has it been so difficult for the U. S. to come up with a workable relationship with Vladimir Putin? You remember that Margaret Thatcher, the former British prime minister, famously said of Gorbachev, you know what? I can do business with him. Why is it that the U. S. seems to have such a hard time doing business with Vladimir Putin? KIM: The funny thing is that that is exactly what Obama tried. He said, we're going to work on the things we can agree on and sort of put aside the things we disagree on. And the things the U. S. and Russia agreed on was, you know, Iran nuclear deal, fighting the Taliban in Afghanistan, nuclear nonproliferation. But as I said, Putin was still really suspicious of what the U. S. is really up to. So I think that Trump, you know, might be able to win him over if he stops talking about things like individual rights or free elections. But it's really unclear that a better relationship, you know, personal relationship between the two men could really be the basis for a better long-term relationship between the U. S. and Russia as countries. MARTIN: Before we let you go, Lucian, what does this look like from where you sit in Moscow? How are Russians reacting to all of these recent stories in the news, the accusations about the Kremlin having directed these cyberattacks with an effort to tip the scales of the U. S. elections? How does all that look from your end? KIM: Well, I think if you had to describe it in one word it would be mockery. Just this evening, the head of Russia's main state-run news agency - his name is Dmitry Kiselyov - he had his weekly news show. And he said outright that the CIA is perpetrating a coup against Donald Trump. He said they're not providing any evidence, we don't know who the sources are. And so he says the real reason for all that's going on in the U. S. is that the military industrial complex in the U. S. is backing Clinton. So, you know, from the point of view of the Kremlin, all that the - all these accusations swirling around only prove that the U.

KENYON: Well, at first, all we had was that video and the audio we just heard. He's shouting both in Arabic and Turkish about Syria and Aleppo. Remember those places; if there's devastation there, there'll never be peace here - things like that. But the story's - just keeps unfolding. And now Turkey's interior minister has identified the attacker as an off-duty Turkish police officer. He was a man in his early 20s. His name was Mevlut Mert Altintas, assigned to the riot police. And now, this all happened at a modern art center in the Turkish capital. The Russian ambassador Andrey Karlov was speaking at the opening of a photo exhibit. There were other people wounded in the shooting. This is basically a very shocking event for Turkey.

SHAPIRO: Tell us more about Ambassador Karlov and his role in the Syria conflict.

And that means working on the Syria conflict which is the big thorn in the side of both countries here 'cause their positions are basically incompatible. Turkey wants President Bashar al-Assad out.

KENYON: Well, exactly - I mean Turkey's foreign minister heard of this killing as he was preparing to fly to Moscow for talks tomorrow with his Russian and Iranian counterparts on Syria. Moscow says those talks are going to go ahead, and this assassination of the Russian ambassador to Turkey will be addressed tomorrow. Turkey's president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan's, calling it a provocation aimed at ruining ties with Russia. The interior minister's calling it a bullet fired at our country.

JANE ARRAF, BYLINE: Well, Robert, to put it into a bit of historical perspective, according to some commanders I've spoken with, you'd actually have to go back to World War II to find urban fighting of this ferocity and this scale. So we're talking about a territory that's bigger than Washington, D. C. And then it's riddled with suicide bombers and snipers and explosive experts. And it's a really old city. There are winding alleys and narrow streets. When I was covering U. S. soldiers on patrol in Mosul in 2003, they had a tough time navigating those streets. But really the main reason it's going so slowly are the civilians. There are still at least 700,000 of them in there. SIEGEL: We're hearing about conditions for those civilians are worsening. How would you describe what's happening? ARRAF: Really dreadful and very, very worrying because it's winter now. It's freezing cold and basics are the biggest problem. So with the water, some of the water pipelines have been damaged in the fighting. They're digging wells or they're walking for miles with jerry cans to get water from places that still have it. And some are drinking water out of the river. There's a real lack of medical care. The U. S. -led coalition bombed the hospital there, saying it was an ISIS hideout. And the medical care there hasn't been great to begin with. Food is increasingly scarce, although it's in the markets. We're told that hardly anyone can afford it. It's really quite a grim situation. SIEGEL: Why don't people leave, or can they leave Mosul at this stage? ARRAF: They really can't. So at the beginning, the U. S. and Iraqi strategy was - they thought that people would actually rise up and they'd be able to leave on their own in some places. That hasn't happened. So now the situation is that ISIS isn't letting them leave. As the fighting moves over to the west side of the river, ISIS is actually herding people deeper into the city, essentially to use as human shields. Even if they could get beyond that barrier, there's really no place they can go because Iraqi forces with U. S. backing have the city surrounded. It's been a conscious strategy. They've surrounded the city. They've blown out all of the bridges but one. So while there might be a trickle of people who manage to get through that, there's really no corridor that's left for people to go through. And that's because the Iraqis and the Americans have made the decision that if you leave a corridor for civilians to get through, that means that ISIS fighters can also retreat. And they fear they will be fighting this war against ISIS forever if that happens. SIEGEL: Sounds terrible. What's likely to happen next? ARRAF: Well, now the fighting is concentrated on a side of the river that's newer and has wider streets. There at least is the ability for U. S. airstrikes in some places. And as we know, they try very hard to avoid civilian casualties. But as they get further into that city and further into the more densely populated areas and cross that river, it's going to be very hard to use that airpower. What we're looking at is neighborhood-by-neighborhood, house-to-house fighting, again, in a city that's full of explosives and full of civilians. It's expected to be a much tougher fight going in as we get further along and it's expected to take weeks, if not months more. SIEGEL: That's NPR's Jane Arraf in Cairo, who until yesterday was in northern Iraq reporting on the battle for Mosul. Thanks. ARRAF: Thank you. ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:  Now we're going to check in on what's become a long, drawn-out battle for the Iraqi city of Mosul. ISIS had controlled the large city for more than two years. Then about two months ago, Iraqi forces - with the help of U. S. airpower and advisers on the ground - started to try to retake the city. That effort is going slowly and many civilians are facing increased danger and deprivation. We're joined now by NPR's Jane Arraf, who just returned from a reporting trip to northern Iraq.

The governor of the State in Mexico (ph) says at least 29 people were killed, and many more people have been injured. NPR's Carrie Kahn joins us now from Mexico City. And Carrie, what can you tell us about what happened today? CARRIE KAHN, BYLINE: Shortly before 3 in the afternoon, there was this huge explosion in the town. It just - it rocked homes and businesses in the area. And these - and it just set off a chain reaction through this market that sells fireworks. The detonations continued. It sent up this impressive, thick cloud of smoke that rose a mile into the sky and could be seen for miles around. A motorist driving by posted to Facebook a video of the scene. You can hear some of the detonations. (SOUNDBITE OF EXPLOSIONS)KAHN: The detonations that you hear in that - they continued - I heard some reports - as long as 12 minutes. It just set off this chain reaction through this market and - according to some reports. The scene also after that sounded just chaotic 'cause there was this thick smoke. And people were just running from the scene. And the injured suffered severe burns. There were also some injured in the trampling of trying to get out of this market. SHAPIRO: Can you tell us more about the market and the town where it's located? KAHN: Sure. This town is in the State of Mexico, which is the largest, most populace state that surrounds Mexico City. And this market is supposedly the largest fireworks market in Latin America. There are 300 stalls that have permission from the secretary of defense to set up shop there and sell fireworks. In this whole town of Tepic, 90 percent of the people that supposedly - reportedly work in that town work in the fireworks industry. So this is what this town is about. And 80 percent of fireworks sold throughout the country go through that town are stored in warehouses and sold in that marketplace, which is just immense. And the photos and the scenes from the area is just the - the devastation is immense. Some of these stalls are just leveled, burned out. You see others that are twisted, and it's just a large area. It just seems like a terribly chaotic situation that's happening right there. SHAPIRO: What can you tell us about rescue and recovery efforts now? KAHN: Well, the governor of the State of Mexico gave a press conference this evening. He said that 26 people died at the scene, and three more died in area hospitals. But those numbers are very fluid. We heard a lot of different numbers. When it was first reported, we heard that there were 19 dead, then all the sudden - 9 dead - I'm sorry. And then all the sudden it rose to 26. And so there may be more fatalities. Many of the people were severely burned over their bodied. Many are in critical conditions, and they've been helicoptering them and taking them to area hospitals and taking them - flying them into Mexico City. And I heard one report that some of the critical are even being flown as far away as Texas for help in burn centers. SHAPIRO: NPR's Carrie Kahn in Mexico City - thank you, Carrie.

Russia is one of the biggest backers of the Syrian regime. Turkey supports some of the groups opposing the regime. Both Turkey and Russia oppose ISIS, the so-called Islamic State. But Turkey also opposes the Kurdish groups that are doing a lot of the fighting against ISIS. To help us sort out those political cross-currents, Soner Cagaptay joins us. He's director of the Turkish Research Program at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. Good to see you again. SONER CAGAPTAY: It's a pleasure. SIEGEL: An off-duty Turkish policeman kills a Russian diplomat and shouts slogans of Islamism and solidarity with Syrian Sunni Muslim rebels. Do you think that many Turks share the view that Russia is doing something terrible and anti-Islamic in Syria? CAGAPTAY: I think quite a few. I think the Turks have been watching this civil war next door in Syria, specifically Aleppo, which is only 45 minutes' drive from the Turkish border. It's been basically ruined and destroyed by Russians and air bombing. And many people sympathize with the suffering of people over there. But there's also a political element to this. Turkey's government is involved as a party in the Syrian civil war. So people do not necessarily have a politically neutral view of the war. Of course, they identify strongly with the anti-Assad rebels, and they despise everybody who's bombing them, including the Russians and the Assad regime. SIEGEL: Some people say that Turkey made the fall of Aleppo possible. Do you agree with that? Is that a fair statement? CAGAPTAY: I don't think so. I think Turkey has been the voice of reason in making sure that people in Aleppo are not slaughtered. Otherwise, they would have been bombed into submission by the Russians and by the Iranian militia. I think what Turkey has done in the absence of U. S. leadership in northern Syria is stepped in and facilitated the evacuation of civilians from eastern Aleppo. In my view, Turkey has probably prevented genocide from taking place. SIEGEL: But do you think that Turkish President Erdogan is in line with the Turkish public in his view of what's happening in Syria, what he's doing, or would he face opposition? CAGAPTAY: I would say, like on all other issues - on this issue as well - Turkey's very polarized and deeply divided. Turkey is one of the most polarized countries in the world to the extent that there are two constituencies in the country; one that's pro-Erdogan, one that's anti-Erdogan. For pro-Erdogan constituency, Turkey is heaven. And for anti-Erdogan constituency, it's hell. And they see everything through the prism of that perception. So for his supporters, which is about half of the country's population, he can do nothing wrong, including in Syria. For his opponents, everything he does in Syria is wrong. SIEGEL: Where do this week's events leave Turkish-Russian relations? CAGAPTAY: I think that actually Turkish-Russian ties will probably be not seriously negatively affected. Russia has got pretty much everything it wants from Turkey, Northern Syria. Recently, we have seen a convergence of Turkish and Russian policies. Russia has got green light from Turkey for the fall of Aleppo. It's been able to capture that city and pass it into the hands of the Assad regime. So Russia has everything it wants, and I think, therefore, the Russians will not overreact to the assassination of their ambassador. And Turkish government, too, wants to not derail the normalization process with the Russians. They have a lot to lose because they're fighting so many enemies inside Syria, including the Kurds and ISIS and the Assad regime. They don't want to add Russians to that list. So they will do whatever they can to make sure that the relationship does not collapse as a result of the assassination. SIEGEL: Almost as soon as the gunman was shot yesterday in Ankara, Turkish officials were saying they wanted to see if he was linked to Fethullah Gulen, the exiled Islamic scholar who lives in Pennsylvania. There's no confirmation that he was in any way connected to Gulen. But there's one difference in the entire relationship between Erdogan and Gulen. Michael Flynn, the incoming national security adviser for Donald Trump, has written very sympathetically about Turkey's demand to extradite this man who's been living in exile here all these years. How much would that change U. S. -Turkish relations? CAGAPTAY: Of course, Gulen denies any involvement. . . SIEGEL: Yes. CAGAPTAY: . . . In the coup or in the assassination. But it will be a huge game-changer in the relationship if the United States were to decide to extradite Mr. Gulen. Erdogan sees him as completely responsible for the coup plot last summer. And therefore, his extradition would be a game-changer. And what would the U. S. take in return? I think this will be a consideration for President-elect Trump. He has said that he wants to defeat ISIS. He also has said that he doesn't want to put boots on the ground in the Middle East. How do you defeat ISIS without boots on the ground? Turkish boots on the ground. Turkey already has troops in Syria. This will be part of the negotiations between President Trump and Erdogan.

Andrei Karlov had been involved in negotiations over Syria. Today, a plane carrying his body left Turkey for Russia, and Russian investigators arrived in Ankara to work with Turkish police. One thing they'll be looking at is the background of the suspect, an off-duty Turkish policeman. NPR's Peter Kenyon reports. PETER KENYON, BYLINE: More information about the assailant and his movements is coming to light. Ankara Officials tell Turkey's Hurriyet Daily News that 22-year-old Mevlut Mert Altintas was on a leave of absence and stayed at an Ankara hotel near the art exhibition where the shooting took place. He was stopped by security when he refused to go through the metal detector but was allowed to pass when he showed his police ID. Turkish police detained Altintas' roommate and family members for questioning. The investigating team will include more than a dozen Russians as Turkey scrambles to prevent this attack from derailing its attempt to normalize relations with Moscow. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN: (Shouting in foreign language). KENYON: A somber ceremony was held at Ankara's main airport as Ambassador Karlov's remains were loaded onto a plane bound for Russia. In Moscow, Russia hosted Turkish and Iranian diplomats for a meeting on Syria. The three countries sought to present a unified front. But that's not easy with Turkey supporting opposition rebels and Russia and Iran backing the Syrian government. With Iran's foreign minister looking on, Turkey's foreign minister Mevlut Cavusoglu called for Tehran to stop funding the Lebanese Hezbollah militia that's fighting on the Syrian government's behalf. MEVLUT CAVUSOGLU: (Through interpreter) We are talking about a countrywide cease-fire for Syria. Of course, this would not cover terror groups. The fight against these groups will continue. But there is the regime and rebels there. In addition to them, there are groups coming from outside of Syria, such as Hezbollah and others. All the support to these groups should be halted. We're talking about a cease-fire and a political resolution. KENYON: Security was tight in Turkey following the assassination yesterday. Hours after the attack, which ended with Altintas being shot and killed by police, a gunman fired shots outside the U. S. embassy. The embassy and two U. S. consulates were closed for business today, as were Iran's diplomatic missions in Turkey. The assassination of Andrei Karlov was almost universally condemned, except among Syrian opposition rebels. One tweet posted by opposition commentator Moussa al-Omar says, quote, \"this was not a game by Turkish intelligence or a conspiracy. It was simply a killing for the sake of the people of Aleppo. \"Revenge for the Russian and Syrian bombing of rebel-held parts of Aleppo was what the assassin seemed to be calling for after he opened fire on Ambassador Karlov. Peter Kenyon, NPR News, Istanbul. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:   We begin this hour with the assassination of the Russian ambassador to Turkey and what it might mean for relations in that part of the world. Andrei Karlov had been involved in negotiations over Syria. Today, a plane carrying his body left Turkey for Russia, and Russian investigators arrived in Ankara to work with Turkish police. One thing they'll be looking at is the background of the suspect, an off-duty Turkish policeman. NPR's Peter Kenyon reports. PETER KENYON, BYLINE: More information about the assailant and his movements is coming to light. Ankara Officials tell Turkey's Hurriyet Daily News that 22-year-old Mevlut Mert Altintas was on a leave of absence and stayed at an Ankara hotel near the art exhibition where the shooting took place. He was stopped by security when he refused to go through the metal detector but was allowed to pass when he showed his police ID. Turkish police detained Altintas' roommate and family members for questioning. The investigating team will include more than a dozen Russians as Turkey scrambles to prevent this attack from derailing its attempt to normalize relations with Moscow. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED MAN: (Shouting in foreign language). KENYON: A somber ceremony was held at Ankara's main airport as Ambassador Karlov's remains were loaded onto a plane bound for Russia. In Moscow, Russia hosted Turkish and Iranian diplomats for a meeting on Syria. The three countries sought to present a unified front. But that's not easy with Turkey supporting opposition rebels and Russia and Iran backing the Syrian government. With Iran's foreign minister looking on, Turkey's foreign minister Mevlut Cavusoglu called for Tehran to stop funding the Lebanese Hezbollah militia that's fighting on the Syrian government's behalf.

I'm Terry Gross. President-elect Donald Trump has generated plenty of news and controversy with his cabinet picks. And, today, we're going to focus on his nominee for secretary of state Rex Tillerson. Tillerson is the CEO of ExxonMobil where he's worked his entire career. At a time when climate change is an important global issue, Tillerson has spent years advancing the interests of a fossil fuel company that has at times aggressively funded attacks on climate change science. And at a time when U. S. relations with Russia are strained and intelligence officials say Russia sought to influence the presidential election, Tillerson's been deeply involved in Exxon's oil-drilling projects in Russia, and he has a personal relationship with President Vladimir Putin. Our guest is Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Steve Coll. He's a staff writer at The New Yorker reporting on issues of intelligence and national security in the U. S. and abroad. In 2012, he wrote a book about ExxonMobil called \"Private Empire: ExxonMobil And American Power. \" He's written six other books and is dean of the Graduate School of Journalism at Columbia University. He spoke with FRESH AIR's Dave Davies. DAVE DAVIES: Well, Steve Coll, welcome back to the show. Rex Tillerson has worked at ExxonMobil his whole life. Tell us a bit about the corporate culture at ExxonMobil. What distinguishes it from other companies? STEVE COLL: Well, of the oil companies that descended from Standard Oil - the monopoly that John Rockefeller built up at the turn of the 20th century - ExxonMobil is closest to the original in the way it operates and in its culture and values. Rockefeller famously blended a - an ardent Protestant faith with a ruthless, capitalist ethos, and there's a lot of that echo at ExxonMobil today. Former officials when I was researching \"Private Empire,\" the book about the corporation, would say that as recently as the 1970s, it wasn't uncommon at ExxonMobil to open just a business meeting with a prayer. And there's still a strong focus on business competition and performance above all else. I think part of that is about the stability of the oil industry. ExxonMobil's one of the few corporations left in the United States where you really can work cradle to grave, and they operate that way. They recruit out of graduate schools focused on oil engineering and related skills. And then there's a sort of upper-out threshold five to seven years into your career. If you want to stay, you've got to get used to Exxon's rules and its very tight, internal culture. Everything is in a rule book, and you're expected to follow it. But if you do stay, you can stay for 30 years, retire with a defined benefit pension and and live quite comfortably. BYLINE: Yeah. Rex Tillerson himself was an engineering student at the University of Texas, right? You mentioned corporate rules. What kind of rules? COLL: Well, there's a document or a binder in every employee's office notoriously referred to as OIMS. I think it's - botched the acronym, but it essentially is an operating manual for your job. And it could be hundreds of pages, and it provides instruction, guidance for how you do everything from contract for pencils to park your car to negotiate terms to speak to the press - or in most cases not speak to the press. And it's a very engineering-led culture. So these are all folks who basically think there's an answer to the problem that arises from the way you work in drilling fields. How do you build wells? How do you get oil out of the ground? How do you build the pipeline? And also financial engineering - how do you measure returns on huge investments that they make in projects? Project engineering - how do you make sure you get on time and on budget? So these are very linear processes. They're all written down and documented. It's a global corporation, so they have employees working all over the world and part of the purpose of the rule book is to make sure that somebody taking on a project in Indonesia or in West Africa does it the same way they would if it were in Alaska or in Texas. BYLINE: OK. So Rex Tillerson, if confirmed, will be secretary of state, and he has a lot of experience in international business. Give us a sense of the scale of Exxon's international reach and, you know, the extent to which it could be regarded as a player on the level of a nation state. COLL: Well, I think it is a player on the level of a nation state. As I was researching the way it operates around the world, I came to think of it that way through interviews with leaders and competitors and employees in diverse countries. And then as I got to know ExxonMobil even better at its headquarters, I came to understand it's not just an outsider who might think of it this way. That's actually the way they see themselves. They see themselves as an independent sovereign in the world motivated by their devotion to their shareholders and their shareholders' interests. And they have the scale of a sovereign nation. They operate in more than 100 countries. The number varies from time to time. Their revenue before the oil price collapsed was in the order of $400 billion a year. And now it's more like 300, but that's still the size of the economy of South Africa. And they, I think, operate independently in a sense of foreign policy as well. That is they see their role in the diverse countries where they work as entirely independent, for example, of U. S. foreign policy. And they make decisions on the basis of what's best for ExxonMobil shareholders not what's best for the United States. BYLINE: Are there clear examples where Exxon's interest propelled them to a foreign policy in opposition to American foreign policy? COLL: Yes. I've mentioned two fairly recently during the Obama administration. So in Iraq, it was the policy of the United States government to promote national unity by encouraging international corporations and oil corporations to do their business with the central government in Baghdad to prevent fragmentation of an already stressed Iraqi state. But ExxonMobil decided to do independent business with the Kurdish regional government which basically said pay no attention to Baghdad. Come on over here. We'll give you a better deal. And ExxonMobil did that under Tillerson's leadership without consulting with the Obama administration in advance, and it was a big deal as a departure from the effort to get everyone to concentrate on Baghdad. And after they made their announcement, he scheduled a phone call with the State Department, and basically said, look, I had to do what was best for my shareholders and this was my judgment. A second more recent example involves Russia where after sanctions were imposed on the Russian government, the Obama administration tried to discourage corporate leaders from attending certain economic conferences that Vladimir Putin's government hosted. And Tillerson went anyway. And it wasn't a violation of sanctions or anything, but it was a symbolic defiance of what the Obama administration was trying to achieve. BYLINE: You know, you write that an oil company needs stability in the places it operates. It - drilling wells is expensive. It takes decades to get the return from them, so they want places that will be stable. So they have to - so Exxon has dealt with a lot of authoritarian regimes, some of which, you know, are ruled by dictators who enrich themselves. What's Tillerson's record when it comes to dealing with those kinds of governments? COLL: Well, he's been successful at making arrangements with authoritarian governments in many places in the world, certainly in Vladimir Putin's Russia, in West Africa, in Equatorial Guinea, in Chad and in other places across the Middle East. In Qatar, they have a strong presence, and elsewhere in the Gulf states, ExxonMobil's very active. You know, they also operate in more raucous environments. But, generally, they've had better success economic and business success in environments that are stable because of authoritarian government than in a place like Alaska where Tillerson has repeatedly expressed frustration that ExxonMobil can't get stable terms to the deals it wants to make because the government keeps changing. Well, that's because we have elections in Alaska, and politics of oil up there are pretty - you know, pretty raucous. So I'm not saying that that means he's anti-democratic, but I am just saying he's been conditioned by experience to work productively and without a lot of criticism or interference in politically authoritarian environments. BYLINE: You know, there are a lot of decisions that companies that work in - with authoritarian regimes have to make. And it's one thing to say, well, we're not going to, you know, seek the overthrow of an authoritarian regime. But there are other decisions you can make. You can participate in bribing officials or facilitating, you know, the extraction of large amounts of assets for the - for royal families. Do you have any sense of how Exxon and Tillerson's - any sense of their record in terms of the extent to which they violate things like the Corrupt Foreign Practices Act? And what's their. . . COLL: They're - they're. . . BYLINE: . . . What's their record of integrity in that area? COLL: Well, we talked before about their rulemaking and their adherence to rules. And I do think that they use the law as a - as an organizing principle everywhere. And they're very - very devoted to trying to figure out how not to get outside of the law and also to promote the rule of law internationally because that aids their business model in the sense that it makes contracts enforceable. And it also gives them a way to avoid the kinds of dilemmas that are presented when dictators' relatives come around looking for contracts or for favors. ExxonMobil can say, hey, we follow the law everywhere. This is not legal. We're not going to do it. And so it's a way to be consistent. You know, where it gets more subtle is outside of the direct corruption of enabling capital flight or taking payoffs or making payoffs. You know, what do you do in these societies while you're there to promote better humanitarian conditions, better governance? Are you willing to take any risks to call out a host government on its domestic conduct, on its imprisonment of political-opposition figures, its suppression of journalists or human rights activists? There, ExxonMobil is very cautious on the whole. They have incorporated human rights principles in their own operations, their own security procedures. They were slow to do that, but they've done it quite thoroughly. But when it comes to trying to use their influence in a place like Chad to create different politics, better politics, they steer away from that. They tend to do relatively uncontroversial projects, like, say, promotion of public health, which is good but is sort of apolitical. BYLINE: Steve Coll is a staff writer at The New Yorker. We'll continue our conversation after a short break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)BYLINE: This is FRESH AIR, and we're speaking with Steve Coll. He is a staff writer at The New Yorker, reporting on issues of intelligence and national security in the U. S. and abroad. He's also the author of the 2012 book \"Private Empire: ExxonMobil And American Power. \" We're talking about the nomination of ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson to be secretary of state. Tillerson has no diplomatic experience, but he's had a lot of experience as a - as a deal-maker in other countries. Has that honed skills that will be useful to him as secretary of state, do you think? COLL: Sure. I mean, the secretary of state has lots of different functions, but some of them - the day-to-day work - are quite similar to what Tillerson has done for 10 years at ExxonMobil. These include negotiating with foreign leaders about complicated subjects. They include digesting lots of political analysis, intelligence, and trying to figure out what's true, what's not, what it means for how to proceed. ExxonMobil has its own, essentially foreign policy apparatus at the headquarters - political analysts, intelligence analysts, some former U. S. intelligence and foreign policy-makers - who replicate the kind of inbox that you'd get as secretary for aiding decision making. And attending ceremonial events, he's done plenty of that. And assessing foreign leaders, trying to figure out how to get under their skin or how to get them to some place you want to move them - all of that is relevant. But here's the other half of the job. That involves not deals, but ideas. And it involves the diplomatic service of the United States, which is a career service spread out all over the world and which not only negotiates across the street with the host government, but also delivers and defines the aid, the resources that the United States provides in that country, whether it's support for local human rights groups or democracy organizers or whether it's through USAID, new technologies to help free speech and free organizing in authoritarian countries. You know, the United States is often the last outpost in faraway places for dissidents or minority religions or investigative reporters who come under pressure. And so the diplomatic service, the career service that he'll now lead, that's their ethos. That's why they came into the United States government in many cases. That's what they do out there, distributed across all these embassies and consulates. And so the odd fit is not the kind of tactical deal-making part. There, he's well suited. It's the, what does he think about all of this. He's never - he has no record of writing about these foreign policy issues from an American perspective as opposed to an Exxon perspective. BYLINE: And do we know anything about Rex Tillerson's views about, you know, the major conflicts in the world - you know, NATO, Israel and Palestine - or about his views of the use of American power? COLL: Not much about the ones you just listed. I think the other tactical issue that's certainly going to come up in his confirmation hearings involves sanctions as an instrument of foreign policy. So ExxonMobil has long lobbied against sanctions, both in principle and in lots of specific cases. They're opposed to them, Tillerson sometimes says, because he doesn't think they're very effective. But, of course, it doesn't take a lot of cynicism to see that ExxonMobil opposes them because they undermine ExxonMobil's business opportunities. And he has - ExxonMobil, in various stages, has argued against sanctions not only in Russia, which will be a controversy during the confirmation, but also previously in Iran and in Iraq - in Saddam Hussein's Iraq. They just basically don't want the United States to pressure other governments by constricting business opportunities. And it would be surprising if he came to office now, turning around and saying, actually, sanctions are an alternative to war that we really ought to prioritize and refine how to make them more effective. It's possible that he'll take that turnaround view, but it would be a real departure from ExxonMobil's policies. BYLINE: And what do we know about his beliefs about global warming and his record on climate change regulation? COLL: Well, ExxonMobil has, as a corporation, a pretty miserable record on climate change. They, during the 1990s and early 2000s, funded groups led by non-scientists to promote the idea that climate science was unreliable. And they've continued, from time to time, to support groups that continue to undermine climate science, even without scientists in the lead. But Tillerson's ascension to the top job in 2006 marked a change in the way ExxonMobil communicated about climate and climate science issues. He inherited this portfolio from his predecessor, Lee Raymond, who was a really ardent climate skeptic - very outspoken. At one point in 2000, he said publicly he thought it was more likely the world would get cold than it would get warm. He just didn't believe the science. And he really put ExxonMobil way out in front on this issue. It wasn't really an existential issue for ExxonMobil whether or not there would be a price on carbon. But Lee Raymond treated it as if it were. And so Tillerson came in. And he has said that he wanted to kind of reset ExxonMobil's communications about this. And he did. He started talking about climate in a different way. Yes, the risks are there. They're serious. We should take them seriously. Then in 2009, when it looked like there was a possibility that Congress might actually pass climate regulation in the form of a cap and trade bill that would impose a price on carbon fuels, Tillerson came out and said, I oppose that method of cap and trade because it's too complicated. But I now support a tax - a carbon tax. Twenty dollars a ton was what he said at the time, I think. And that was a big change. At least now they were saying that they, in theory, supported policies that would price carbon in order to reduce the risks of climate change. The problem is that seven years have passed. ExxonMobil really hasn't done anything to advance that position. And though they make statements taking note of how serious the international response to climate risks has become and they don't actively rhetorically oppose agreements like the recent one at Paris, they really seem to just be stepping back and not leading in this area. BYLINE: You know, in discussing his worldview, he said a few years ago his favorite book is the Ayn Rand novel \"Atlas Shrugged. \" Not everybody remembers that. What - what does that tell us about his worldview? COLL: Well, that 1957 novel - sort of dystopian novel - has become a kind of touchstone for libertarians and skeptics of states - state power, government. It's often cited by folks who really think the government is the problem and that what's really required is individual initiative, individual virtue. And so yes, it's a very specific choice to have listed. It was in response to a question, I believe from a Boy Scout magazine, as to what his favorite book was. And he listed that one. So I think he comes to Washington not just as an outsider in his career, having never held a government position or served the United States government in that way, but maybe an outsider also in his mind about how effective the U. S. government is as an instrument of the interests of the American people. GROSS: We're listening to the interview FRESH AIR's Dave Davies recorded with Steve Coll about Rex Tillerson, the CEO of ExxonMobil, who is now Donald Trump's nominee for secretary of state. Coll is the author of a book about ExxonMobil and wrote a recent article about Tillerson in The New Yorker. After a break, they'll talk about how U. S. sanctions against Russia have affected ExxonMobil's interests there, and jazz critic Kevin Whitehead will remember some of the great jazz musicians we lost this year. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Let's get back to the interview that FRESH AIR's Dave Davies recorded with Steve Coll about Rex Tillerson, who is Donald Trump's nominee for secretary of state. Tillerson is the CEO of ExxonMobil. Coll is the author of a book about ExxonMobil and wrote a recent article in The New Yorker headlined, \"Rex Tillerson: From A Corporate Oil Sovereign To The State Department. \" Coll is a staff writer for The New Yorker and dean of the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism. BYLINE: So Tillerson's relationship with Russia and his personal relationship with Vladimir Putin is certainly an issue as people discuss this nomination. How long has he - has Tillerson been representing Exxon in Russia? COLL: Well, Exxon started to negotiate a deal that still is going on in Russia as far back as 1996. And Tillerson was certainly involved in the late '90s and early 2000s as he rose through the corporation toward becoming CEO. So really, I think, it's fair to say he's been in Russia for 20 or more years in and out. And when Putin came to power in 2000, that was the main partner that he needed to deal with and, certainly, during his time as CEO has dealt with extensively leading up to, you know, big agreements announced as recently as 2011, 2012 to explore in the Arctic - the Russian Arctic - a deal that had at least a top-line potential of $500 billion. So in short, he's been there for at least two decades. BYLINE: So give us a sense of the scale of Exxon's business interests and dealings with the Russian government. COLL: Well, I don't think they're decisive to ExxonMobil, but they have managed to do what a lot of international oil corporations have not which is to stay through all kinds of political weather. They have two big projects out in Siberia off the coast of Siberia that they partnered with Russian entities to carry out. And what Exxon brought to the table was advanced drilling and project management technology that could work in really, really harsh weather. You know, Russia has a lot of oil. It has a lot of mature oil fields that have been around for decades and decades. Russia doesn't need outside help with those. The next frontier for Russian oil production is in tough places toward the Arctic or out in Siberia, so that's what brought ExxonMobil in. But then what happens in Russia is that if you - if you're not careful, you'll get your lunch stolen. And a lot of corporations that have come in and done deals in the Putin era have ended up having to exit because of various conflicts with Russian tax authorities or different Russian oil interests that were close to Putin and got crosswise with the outsiders. And somehow Exxon has managed to hang in there, stay close to Putin, stay close to a guy named Igor Sechin who is the chief executive of Rosneft now, but was one of the original kind of hard men around Putin and has been critical to Putin's government really since it began. BYLINE: Rosneft is one of the Russian oil companies, right? And what do we know about his personal relationship with Putin? COLL: Well, not a ton, to be honest. I mean, we know they spent a lot of time together. They've successfully negotiated very complex, very ambitious agreements. We know that Igor Sechin has been a very important part of their relationship. We know that Tillerson is willing to demonstrate that he will defy the United States government by attending conferences that the Obama administration doesn't want him to go to. And one can imagine that a certain intimacy has built up over this long record of negotiations with a single leader in Putin. But what the real flavor of that is, I mean - it's behind closed doors. Neither the Russians nor ExxonMobil makes any of that transparent. An interesting question that may surface during the confirmation hearings is that Tillerson has had personal ties with two targets of American intelligence collection for a long time - Putin and Sechin. And anyone who knows how the world works would be aware that every conversation you have in Russia with either of those gentlemen is likely to be recorded both by the Russian government to use it against you if they can somehow and by the U. S. government to try to figure out what's going on and maybe by other governments as well. So I'm assuming that Tillerson has been smart enough over the years to manage his conversations and his presence in Russia with that in mind as if he were in a fishbowl, even though nobody else in the world knows exactly what was said. In fact, there are probably transcripts in both governments of many of these meetings. And so if he's made mistakes, if he's made terrible judgments from the perspective of a future secretary of state, it's possible that that will surface because there are plenty of bureaucrats in the U. S. system who would have had access to that material. BYLINE: I don't know - this is speculative - but can you imagine a way in which some of this information might come out? COLL: I think it would only come out on the U. S. side. I don't think the Russians have any motivation to put it out. They would much rather have someone they know, someone they've had successful negotiations with in power in Washington. Even if Tillerson becomes unfriendly to them on policy matters now that he's a public leader, at least they know how to deal with him and they have a record with him now. On the U. S. side, I think it would only come out if in that material there is something truly disturbing from the perspective of the candidate's judgment or his willing to accommodate Russian behavior that is, you know, outside the lines. BYLINE: And as the Senate considers his nomination - I mean, this does have to be approved by the Senate. Will they be able to talk to U. S. intelligence officials about any of this material? COLL: Yeah. I mean, they - the Armed Services Committee and the Senate Intelligence Committee can certainly ask questions. But the bureaucracies will make their own decisions about what's relevant, what's proper to share under U. S. law, how to summarize what they found. So there are regular channels. There are irregular channels, you know, how our system works. Journalism figures in that as well. But I think the bigger question that he's going to face a confirmation is going to come from senators like John McCain and other strong skeptics of Putin and Russia's foreign policy. They're going to want to know are your views as a public leader profoundly different from your actions as ExxonMobil CEO in accommodating these - this government? And if so explain yourself. So what do you think about the independence of Ukraine or the future of Ukraine? What do you think about the expansion of NATO that has brought the United States into solemn commitments to the independence of the Baltic states and vulnerable states in central and southeastern Europe? What do you think about Syria? What do you think about Russia's conduct in the Syrian civil war, these barbarian bombing campaigns deliberately targeting physicians and ambulances? How does human rights figure in American foreign policy in your mind? I mean, McCain is strong on global human rights as anyone in the Democratic Party. So, you know, there are issues of bipartisan foreign policy that really are uncomfortable when you overlay them with ExxonMobil's place in the world. And Tillerson has no record of speaking about that, so that's going to be, I'm sure, drawn out during his confirmation hearings. BYLINE: Steve Coll is a staff writer at The New Yorker. We'll continue our conversation in just a moment. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)BYLINE: This is FRESH AIR, and we're speaking with Steve Coll. He's a staff writer at The New Yorker reporting on issues of intelligence and national security in the U. S. and abroad. He's also the author of the 2012 book \"Private Empire: ExxonMobil And American Power. \"ExxonMobil has some huge deals with Russia for drilling in Siberia, you mentioned, in the Arctic regions as, you know, the melting polar ice cap offers more access to oil deposits up there. When sanctions were imposed on Russia after the seizure of Crimea in 2014 - international economic sanctions - what impact did that have on Exxon's projects with Russia? COLL: It had an impact. It stopped them from going forward with this big framework agreement that they had signed with Rosneft, the Russian oil giant, to explore, as you say, in the Arctic taking advantage of the - particularly, the summer ice melt up there. So it meant that they had to stop business that they had committed to carrying out. And ExxonMobil publicly opposed the sanctions citing its long-standing and generalized belief that sanctions don't work. So yeah, it had a - it had an impact. BYLINE: So to be clear, I mean, Exxon has these huge, you know, multi-hundred billion-dollar projects in Russia that are affected by sanctions. The question is will Tillerson seek relief from those sanctions, which the company he spent his whole career at wants or does he take a different approach? COLL: It's very hard to imagine that Trump and Tillerson working together would have the political space in the U. S. to go upend sanctions without some major set of concessions on Russia's side. And yet, it's a situation without precedent to have a Republican president who is, essentially, if not pro-Russian, remarkably accommodating of a Russian dictator and a secretary of state who has never served in the government, never written in a foreign-policy journal about great power relations or the U. S. relationship with Russia but whose entire experience has been in business negotiations with the Russian state and its offshoots in the oil industry. So yeah, I think when you talk about appearances of conflict of interest, you can talk about it as an ethicist or as a lawyer in the White House counsel's office, but there's a broader picture here which is where are we going with Russia? And where is this leadership - what is it thinking about the kind of relationship that it wants the United States to have with Putin? And how much is it willing to accommodate Putin in the world? BYLINE: You know, when you wrote the book \"Private Empire: ExxonMobil And American Power,\" he did not grant you interviews, but you spent a lot of time talking to people who knew him. You asked him some questions at news conferences. I'm just wondering what sense you got of him and his - is he smart? Is he thoughtful? Is he rigid or open-minded? COLL: He's smart. He's thoughtful. He's comfortable in his own skin. He's a good communicator. He can take a lot of questions and bat them around. He's used to being in front of audiences. He's used to answering questions. But I've been thinking about this because ExxonMobil is such a controlled environment that when they put him out in front of audiences or he goes to the Council on Foreign Relations and gives a prepared speech and then takes five questions - generally, pretty friendly - you know, that's an environment that he thrives in. And I think, behind closed doors, he must be very effective. I've been at private dinners at think tanks where he's appeared. You know, he's at ease. He can talk with lots of different people about lots of different subjects. He doesn't come across as overbearing or, you know, sort of, arrogant. But he has never confronted the kind of uncontrolled questioning and impertinent questioning that a secretary of state has to face, not just all those ornery reporters in the back of your plane everywhere you fly asking you everything that might be newsworthy for their organizations. But, you know, the secretary of state - almost distinctively among those cabinet jobs - they fly all over the world, and they stand in front of the local press. They stand with the leader in front of all kinds of local activists. They meet with the opposition party. They wander around the embassy. And, you know, the career diplomatic service - these people are not always deferential to their leaders. They are independent minded themselves. They'll speak up. This is not Exxon's way. You don't speak up and call the - question the boss's fundamental assumptions in front of an audience. But this is what secretaries of state deal with all the time. And you look at the experienced ones, the ones who have been around this as politicians - John Kerry is a pretty good example - I mean, that stuff is just like rain off his back. He's so used to being under that kind of scrutiny and to taking unfriendly or bizarre questions from time to time. So it will be very interesting, if he is confirmed, to watch how he comes out of the very controlled environment of ExxonMobil into the raucous world of transparent politics. BYLINE: One more question on the subject of potential conflicts of interest - you know, it has been American policy to battle the effects of climate change. We don't know how that will - what that will look like under the Trump administration. But if ExxonMobil is undertaking to drill in the Arctic and areas where, you know, sea ice is melting and pursuing, you know, a policy that presumes many decades of use of fossil fuels, does that put him, potentially, at odds with an important policy goal of the United States? COLL: Well, I suppose it depends on what President Trump's policy goal is. But, you know, absolutely - he's made plain over his leadership of ExxonMobil, notwithstanding the adjustments in public policy and communication that he has overseen that essentially he's inclined to think, OK - there is a risk of climate change. It's a serious risk. We get it. We're at the table. We're listening. We're talking. But we don't want to do anything to prevent the development of global energy, including fossil fuel energy, that would somehow deprive, say, developing societies of burning all the coal they need to fire up electricity and deliver electricity to poor areas and so on and so forth. And then when you get to the climate risk subject, he's given answers from time to time where he says, well, look, OK - even if it is serious, we're engineers. We'll adapt. We'll find a way out of this. And that is the school of thought that, you know, used to be a little bit more prominent than it is today, which is kind of adaptation as the solution. Who knows what that adaptation is? Not, presumably, higher seawalls but some kind of technological magic bullet that resolves all of this rather than preventing it in the first place. Now, on the diplomacy of climate change today, the problem that the Trump administration is going to confront is that the Paris Accord represents a true international consensus about the seriousness of the problem and pathways to address it before we get to catastrophic temperature change. And if the United States essentially tries to undermine that or walk away from it, as Trump has occasionally threatened and as ExxonMobil's record would suggest Tillerson would be inclined to do, all it's going to lead to is isolation because really this question of climate risk in the world - it's a settled political issue. Only in the United States and Australia do you still have science deniers in such prominent roles. And if you want leverage in Europe, if you want leverage in the developing world, you'd better be engaging around this in a serious way. The Trump administration may decide that's just not their priority. They'll walk away, let it die by a thousand cuts or even more actively try to undermine it. But if Tillerson is the pragmatist that his friends and allies say that he is, he's going to want to take a hard look at where this consensus leads in terms of international politics and American influence. BYLINE: Well, Steve Coll, thanks so much for speaking with us. COLL: Thank you for having me. GROSS: Steve Coll is a staff writer for The New Yorker and the author of the 2012 book, \"Private Empire: ExxonMobil And American Power. \" He spoke with FRESH AIR's Dave Davies, who is also WHYY's senior reporter. TERRY GROSS, HOST:  This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. President-elect Donald Trump has generated plenty of news and controversy with his cabinet picks. And, today, we're going to focus on his nominee for secretary of state Rex Tillerson. Tillerson is the CEO of ExxonMobil where he's worked his entire career. At a time when climate change is an important global issue, Tillerson has spent years advancing the interests of a fossil fuel company that has at times aggressively funded attacks on climate change science. And at a time when U. S. relations with Russia are strained and intelligence officials say Russia sought to influence the presidential election, Tillerson's been deeply involved in Exxon's oil-drilling projects in Russia, and he has a personal relationship with President Vladimir Putin. Our guest is Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Steve Coll. He's a staff writer at The New Yorker reporting on issues of intelligence and national security in the U. S. and abroad. In 2012, he wrote a book about ExxonMobil called \"Private Empire: ExxonMobil And American Power. \" He's written six other books and is dean of the Graduate School of Journalism at Columbia University. He spoke with FRESH AIR's Dave Davies. DAVE DAVIES: Well, Steve Coll, welcome back to the show. Rex Tillerson has worked at ExxonMobil his whole life. Tell us a bit about the corporate culture at ExxonMobil. What distinguishes it from other companies? STEVE COLL: Well, of the oil companies that descended from Standard Oil - the monopoly that John Rockefeller built up at the turn of the 20th century - ExxonMobil is closest to the original in the way it operates and in its culture and values. Rockefeller famously blended a - an ardent Protestant faith with a ruthless, capitalist ethos, and there's a lot of that echo at ExxonMobil today. Former officials when I was researching \"Private Empire,\" the book about the corporation, would say that as recently as the 1970s, it wasn't uncommon at ExxonMobil to open just a business meeting with a prayer. And there's still a strong focus on business competition and performance above all else. I think part of that is about the stability of the oil industry. ExxonMobil's one of the few corporations left in the United States where you really can work cradle to grave, and they operate that way. They recruit out of graduate schools focused on oil engineering and related skills. And then there's a sort of upper-out threshold five to seven years into your career. If you want to stay, you've got to get used to Exxon's rules and its very tight, internal culture. Everything is in a rule book, and you're expected to follow it. But if you do stay, you can stay for 30 years, retire with a defined benefit pension and and live quite comfortably. BYLINE: Yeah. Rex Tillerson himself was an engineering student at the University of Texas, right? You mentioned corporate rules. What kind of rules? COLL: Well, there's a document or a binder in every employee's office notoriously referred to as OIMS. I think it's - botched the acronym, but it essentially is an operating manual for your job. And it could be hundreds of pages, and it provides instruction, guidance for how you do everything from contract for pencils to park your car to negotiate terms to speak to the press - or in most cases not speak to the press. And it's a very engineering-led culture. So these are all folks who basically think there's an answer to the problem that arises from the way you work in drilling fields. How do you build wells? How do you get oil out of the ground? How do you build the pipeline? And also financial engineering - how do you measure returns on huge investments that they make in projects? Project engineering - how do you make sure you get on time and on budget? So these are very linear processes. They're all written down and documented. It's a global corporation, so they have employees working all over the world and part of the purpose of the rule book is to make sure that somebody taking on a project in Indonesia or in West Africa does it the same way they would if it were in Alaska or in Texas. BYLINE: OK. So Rex Tillerson, if confirmed, will be secretary of state, and he has a lot of experience in international business. Give us a sense of the scale of Exxon's international reach and, you know, the extent to which it could be regarded as a player on the level of a nation state. COLL: Well, I think it is a player on the level of a nation state. As I was researching the way it operates around the world, I came to think of it that way through interviews with leaders and competitors and employees in diverse countries. And then as I got to know ExxonMobil even better at its headquarters, I came to understand it's not just an outsider who might think of it this way. That's actually the way they see themselves. They see themselves as an independent sovereign in the world motivated by their devotion to their shareholders and their shareholders' interests. And they have the scale of a sovereign nation. They operate in more than 100 countries. The number varies from time to time. Their revenue before the oil price collapsed was in the order of $400 billion a year. And now it's more like 300, but that's still the size of the economy of South Africa. And they, I think, operate independently in a sense of foreign policy as well. That is they see their role in the diverse countries where they work as entirely independent, for example, of U. S. foreign policy. And they make decisions on the basis of what's best for ExxonMobil shareholders not what's best for the United States. BYLINE: Are there clear examples where Exxon's interest propelled them to a foreign policy in opposition to American foreign policy? COLL: Yes. I've mentioned two fairly recently during the Obama administration. So in Iraq, it was the policy of the United States government to promote national unity by encouraging international corporations and oil corporations to do their business with the central government in Baghdad to prevent fragmentation of an already stressed Iraqi state. But ExxonMobil decided to do independent business with the Kurdish regional government which basically said pay no attention to Baghdad. Come on over here. We'll give you a better deal. And ExxonMobil did that under Tillerson's leadership without consulting with the Obama administration in advance, and it was a big deal as a departure from the effort to get everyone to concentrate on Baghdad. And after they made their announcement, he scheduled a phone call with the State Department, and basically said, look, I had to do what was best for my shareholders and this was my judgment. A second more recent example involves Russia where after sanctions were imposed on the Russian government, the Obama administration tried to discourage corporate leaders from attending certain economic conferences that Vladimir Putin's government hosted. And Tillerson went anyway. And it wasn't a violation of sanctions or anything, but it was a symbolic defiance of what the Obama administration was trying to achieve. BYLINE: You know, you write that an oil company needs stability in the places it operates. It - drilling wells is expensive. It takes decades to get the return from them, so they want places that will be stable. So they have to - so Exxon has dealt with a lot of authoritarian regimes, some of which, you know, are ruled by dictators who enrich themselves. What's Tillerson's record when it comes to dealing with those kinds of governments? COLL: Well, he's been successful at making arrangements with authoritarian governments in many places in the world, certainly in Vladimir Putin's Russia, in West Africa, in Equatorial Guinea, in Chad and in other places across the Middle East. In Qatar, they have a strong presence, and elsewhere in the Gulf states, ExxonMobil's very active. You know, they also operate in more raucous environments. But, generally, they've had better success economic and business success in environments that are stable because of authoritarian government than in a place like Alaska where Tillerson has repeatedly expressed frustration that ExxonMobil can't get stable terms to the deals it wants to make because the government keeps changing. Well, that's because we have elections in Alaska, and politics of oil up there are pretty - you know, pretty raucous. So I'm not saying that that means he's anti-democratic, but I am just saying he's been conditioned by experience to work productively and without a lot of criticism or interference in politically authoritarian environments. BYLINE: You know, there are a lot of decisions that companies that work in - with authoritarian regimes have to make. And it's one thing to say, well, we're not going to, you know, seek the overthrow of an authoritarian regime. But there are other decisions you can make. You can participate in bribing officials or facilitating, you know, the extraction of large amounts of assets for the - for royal families. Do you have any sense of how Exxon and Tillerson's - any sense of their record in terms of the extent to which they violate things like the Corrupt Foreign Practices Act? And what's their. . . COLL: They're - they're. . . BYLINE: . . . What's their record of integrity in that area? COLL: Well, we talked before about their rulemaking and their adherence to rules. And I do think that they use the law as a - as an organizing principle everywhere. And they're very - very devoted to trying to figure out how not to get outside of the law and also to promote the rule of law internationally because that aids their business model in the sense that it makes contracts enforceable. And it also gives them a way to avoid the kinds of dilemmas that are presented when dictators' relatives come around looking for contracts or for favors. ExxonMobil can say, hey, we follow the law everywhere. This is not legal. We're not going to do it. And so it's a way to be consistent. You know, where it gets more subtle is outside of the direct corruption of enabling capital flight or taking payoffs or making payoffs. You know, what do you do in these societies while you're there to promote better humanitarian conditions, better governance? Are you willing to take any risks to call out a host government on its domestic conduct, on its imprisonment of political-opposition figures, its suppression of journalists or human rights activists? There, ExxonMobil is very cautious on the whole. They have incorporated human rights principles in their own operations, their own security procedures. They were slow to do that, but they've done it quite thoroughly. But when it comes to trying to use their influence in a place like Chad to create different politics, better politics, they steer away from that. They tend to do relatively uncontroversial projects, like, say, promotion of public health, which is good but is sort of apolitical. BYLINE: Steve Coll is a staff writer at The New Yorker. We'll continue our conversation after a short break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) BYLINE: This is FRESH AIR, and we're speaking with Steve Coll. He is a staff writer at The New Yorker, reporting on issues of intelligence and national security in the U. S. and abroad. He's also the author of the 2012 book \"Private Empire: ExxonMobil And American Power. \" We're talking about the nomination of ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson to be secretary of state. Tillerson has no diplomatic experience, but he's had a lot of experience as a - as a deal-maker in other countries. Has that honed skills that will be useful to him as secretary of state, do you think? COLL: Sure. I mean, the secretary of state has lots of different functions, but some of them - the day-to-day work - are quite similar to what Tillerson has done for 10 years at ExxonMobil. These include negotiating with foreign leaders about complicated subjects. They include digesting lots of political analysis, intelligence, and trying to figure out what's true, what's not, what it means for how to proceed. ExxonMobil has its own, essentially foreign policy apparatus at the headquarters - political analysts, intelligence analysts, some former U. S. intelligence and foreign policy-makers - who replicate the kind of inbox that you'd get as secretary for aiding decision making. And attending ceremonial events, he's done plenty of that. And assessing foreign leaders, trying to figure out how to get under their skin or how to get them to some place you want to move them - all of that is relevant. But here's the other half of the job. That involves not deals, but ideas. And it involves the diplomatic service of the United States, which is a career service spread out all over the world and which not only negotiates across the street with the host government, but also delivers and defines the aid, the resources that the United States provides in that country, whether it's support for local human rights groups or democracy organizers or whether it's through USAID, new technologies to help free speech and free organizing in authoritarian countries. You know, the United States is often the last outpost in faraway places for dissidents or minority religions or investigative reporters who come under pressure. And so the diplomatic service, the career service that he'll now lead, that's their ethos. That's why they came into the United States government in many cases. That's what they do out there, distributed across all these embassies and consulates. And so the odd fit is not the kind of tactical deal-making part. There, he's well suited. It's the, what does he think about all of this. He's never - he has no record of writing about these foreign policy issues from an American perspective as opposed to an Exxon perspective. BYLINE: And do we know anything about Rex Tillerson's views about, you know, the major conflicts in the world - you know, NATO, Israel and Palestine - or about his views of the use of American power? COLL: Not much about the ones you just listed. I think the other tactical issue that's certainly going to come up in his confirmation hearings involves sanctions as an instrument of foreign policy. So ExxonMobil has long lobbied against sanctions, both in principle and in lots of specific cases. They're opposed to them, Tillerson sometimes says, because he doesn't think they're very effective. But, of course, it doesn't take a lot of cynicism to see that ExxonMobil opposes them because they undermine ExxonMobil's business opportunities. And he has - ExxonMobil, in various stages, has argued against sanctions not only in Russia, which will be a controversy during the confirmation, but also previously in Iran and in Iraq - in Saddam Hussein's Iraq. They just basically don't want the United States to pressure other governments by constricting business opportunities. And it would be surprising if he came to office now, turning around and saying, actually, sanctions are an alternative to war that we really ought to prioritize and refine how to make them more effective. It's possible that he'll take that turnaround view, but it would be a real departure from ExxonMobil's policies. BYLINE: And what do we know about his beliefs about global warming and his record on climate change regulation? COLL: Well, ExxonMobil has, as a corporation, a pretty miserable record on climate change. They, during the 1990s and early 2000s, funded groups led by non-scientists to promote the idea that climate science was unreliable. And they've continued, from time to time, to support groups that continue to undermine climate science, even without scientists in the lead. But Tillerson's ascension to the top job in 2006 marked a change in the way ExxonMobil communicated about climate and climate science issues. He inherited this portfolio from his predecessor, Lee Raymond, who was a really ardent climate skeptic - very outspoken. At one point in 2000, he said publicly he thought it was more likely the world would get cold than it would get warm. He just didn't believe the science. And he really put ExxonMobil way out in front on this issue. It wasn't really an existential issue for ExxonMobil whether or not there would be a price on carbon. But Lee Raymond treated it as if it were. And so Tillerson came in. And he has said that he wanted to kind of reset ExxonMobil's communications about this. And he did. He started talking about climate in a different way. Yes, the risks are there. They're serious. We should take them seriously. Then in 2009, when it looked like there was a possibility that Congress might actually pass climate regulation in the form of a cap and trade bill that would impose a price on carbon fuels, Tillerson came out and said, I oppose that method of cap and trade because it's too complicated. But I now support a tax - a carbon tax. Twenty dollars a ton was what he said at the time, I think. And that was a big change. At least now they were saying that they, in theory, supported policies that would price carbon in order to reduce the risks of climate change. The problem is that seven years have passed. ExxonMobil really hasn't done anything to advance that position. And though they make statements taking note of how serious the international response to climate risks has become and they don't actively rhetorically oppose agreements like the recent one at Paris, they really seem to just be stepping back and not leading in this area. BYLINE: You know, in discussing his worldview, he said a few years ago his favorite book is the Ayn Rand novel \"Atlas Shrugged. \" Not everybody remembers that. What - what does that tell us about his worldview? COLL: Well, that 1957 novel - sort of dystopian novel - has become a kind of touchstone for libertarians and skeptics of states - state power, government. It's often cited by folks who really think the government is the problem and that what's really required is individual initiative, individual virtue. And so yes, it's a very specific choice to have listed. It was in response to a question, I believe from a Boy Scout magazine, as to what his favorite book was. And he listed that one. So I think he comes to Washington not just as an outsider in his career, having never held a government position or served the United States government in that way, but maybe an outsider also in his mind about how effective the U. S. government is as an instrument of the interests of the American people. GROSS: We're listening to the interview FRESH AIR's Dave Davies recorded with Steve Coll about Rex Tillerson, the CEO of ExxonMobil, who is now Donald Trump's nominee for secretary of state. Coll is the author of a book about ExxonMobil and wrote a recent article about Tillerson in The New Yorker. After a break, they'll talk about how U. S. sanctions against Russia have affected ExxonMobil's interests there, and jazz critic Kevin Whitehead will remember some of the great jazz musicians we lost this year. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Let's get back to the interview that FRESH AIR's Dave Davies recorded with Steve Coll about Rex Tillerson, who is Donald Trump's nominee for secretary of state. Tillerson is the CEO of ExxonMobil. Coll is the author of a book about ExxonMobil and wrote a recent article in The New Yorker headlined, \"Rex Tillerson: From A Corporate Oil Sovereign To The State Department. \" Coll is a staff writer for The New Yorker and dean of the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism. BYLINE: So Tillerson's relationship with Russia and his personal relationship with Vladimir Putin is certainly an issue as people discuss this nomination. How long has he - has Tillerson been representing Exxon in Russia? COLL: Well, Exxon started to negotiate a deal that still is going on in Russia as far back as 1996. And Tillerson was certainly involved in the late '90s and early 2000s as he rose through the corporation toward becoming CEO. So really, I think, it's fair to say he's been in Russia for 20 or more years in and out. And when Putin came to power in 2000, that was the main partner that he needed to deal with and, certainly, during his time as CEO has dealt with extensively leading up to, you know, big agreements announced as recently as 2011, 2012 to explore in the Arctic - the Russian Arctic - a deal that had at least a top-line potential of $500 billion. So in short, he's been there for at least two decades. BYLINE: So give us a sense of the scale of Exxon's business interests and dealings with the Russian government. COLL: Well, I don't think they're decisive to ExxonMobil, but they have managed to do what a lot of international oil corporations have not which is to stay through all kinds of political weather. They have two big projects out in Siberia off the coast of Siberia that they partnered with Russian entities to carry out. And what Exxon brought to the table was advanced drilling and project management technology that could work in really, really harsh weather. You know, Russia has a lot of oil. It has a lot of mature oil fields that have been around for decades and decades. Russia doesn't need outside help with those. The next frontier for Russian oil production is in tough places toward the Arctic or out in Siberia, so that's what brought ExxonMobil in. But then what happens in Russia is that if you - if you're not careful, you'll get your lunch stolen. And a lot of corporations that have come in and done deals in the Putin era have ended up having to exit because of various conflicts with Russian tax authorities or different Russian oil interests that were close to Putin and got crosswise with the outsiders. And somehow Exxon has managed to hang in there, stay close to Putin, stay close to a guy named Igor Sechin who is the chief executive of Rosneft now, but was one of the original kind of hard men around Putin and has been critical to Putin's government really since it began. BYLINE: Rosneft is one of the Russian oil companies, right? And what do we know about his personal relationship with Putin? COLL: Well, not a ton, to be honest. I mean, we know they spent a lot of time together. They've successfully negotiated very complex, very ambitious agreements. We know that Igor Sechin has been a very important part of their relationship. We know that Tillerson is willing to demonstrate that he will defy the United States government by attending conferences that the Obama administration doesn't want him to go to. And one can imagine that a certain intimacy has built up over this long record of negotiations with a single leader in Putin. But what the real flavor of that is, I mean - it's behind closed doors. Neither the Russians nor ExxonMobil makes any of that transparent. An interesting question that may surface during the confirmation hearings is that Tillerson has had personal ties with two targets of American intelligence collection for a long time - Putin and Sechin. And anyone who knows how the world works would be aware that every conversation you have in Russia with either of those gentlemen is likely to be recorded both by the Russian government to use it against you if they can somehow and by the U. S. government to try to figure out what's going on and maybe by other governments as well. So I'm assuming that Tillerson has been smart enough over the years to manage his conversations and his presence in Russia with that in mind as if he were in a fishbowl, even though nobody else in the world knows exactly what was said. In fact, there are probably transcripts in both governments of many of these meetings. And so if he's made mistakes, if he's made terrible judgments from the perspective of a future secretary of state, it's possible that that will surface because there are plenty of bureaucrats in the U. S. system who would have had access to that material. BYLINE: I don't know - this is speculative - but can you imagine a way in which some of this information might come out? COLL: I think it would only come out on the U. S. side. I don't think the Russians have any motivation to put it out. They would much rather have someone they know, someone they've had successful negotiations with in power in Washington. Even if Tillerson becomes unfriendly to them on policy matters now that he's a public leader, at least they know how to deal with him and they have a record with him now. On the U. S. side, I think it would only come out if in that material there is something truly disturbing from the perspective of the candidate's judgment or his willing to accommodate Russian behavior that is, you know, outside the lines. BYLINE: And as the Senate considers his nomination - I mean, this does have to be approved by the Senate. Will they be able to talk to U. S. intelligence officials about any of this material? COLL: Yeah. I mean, they - the Armed Services Committee and the Senate Intelligence Committee can certainly ask questions. But the bureaucracies will make their own decisions about what's relevant, what's proper to share under U. S. law, how to summarize what they found. So there are regular channels. There are irregular channels, you know, how our system works. Journalism figures in that as well. But I think the bigger question that he's going to face a confirmation is going to come from senators like John McCain and other strong skeptics of Putin and Russia's foreign policy. They're going to want to know are your views as a public leader profoundly different from your actions as ExxonMobil CEO in accommodating these - this government? And if so explain yourself. So what do you think about the independence of Ukraine or the future of Ukraine? What do you think about the expansion of NATO that has brought the United States into solemn commitments to the independence of the Baltic states and vulnerable states in central and southeastern Europe? What do you think about Syria? What do you think about Russia's conduct in the Syrian civil war, these barbarian bombing campaigns deliberately targeting physicians and ambulances? How does human rights figure in American foreign policy in your mind? I mean, McCain is strong on global human rights as anyone in the Democratic Party. So, you know, there are issues of bipartisan foreign policy that really are uncomfortable when you overlay them with ExxonMobil's place in the world. And Tillerson has no record of speaking about that, so that's going to be, I'm sure, drawn out during his confirmation hearings. BYLINE: Steve Coll is a staff writer at The New Yorker. We'll continue our conversation in just a moment. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) BYLINE: This is FRESH AIR, and we're speaking with Steve Coll. He's a staff writer at The New Yorker reporting on issues of intelligence and national security in the U. S. and abroad. He's also the author of the 2012 book \"Private Empire: ExxonMobil And American Power. \" ExxonMobil has some huge deals with Russia for drilling in Siberia, you mentioned, in the Arctic regions as, you know, the melting polar ice cap offers more access to oil deposits up there. When sanctions were imposed on Russia after the seizure of Crimea in 2014 - international economic sanctions - what impact did that have on Exxon's projects with Russia? COLL: It had an impact. It stopped them from going forward with this big framework agreement that they had signed with Rosneft, the Russian oil giant, to explore, as you say, in the Arctic taking advantage of the - particularly, the summer ice melt up there. So it meant that they had to stop business that they had committed to carrying out. And ExxonMobil publicly opposed the sanctions citing its long-standing and generalized belief that sanctions don't work. So yeah, it had a - it had an impact. BYLINE: So to be clear, I mean, Exxon has these huge, you know, multi-hundred billion-dollar projects in Russia that are affected by sanctions. The question is will Tillerson seek relief from those sanctions, which the company he spent his whole career at wants or does he take a different approach? COLL: It's very hard to imagine that Trump and Tillerson working together would have the political space in the U. S. to go upend sanctions without some major set of concessions on Russia's side. And yet, it's a situation without precedent to have a Republican president who is, essentially, if not pro-Russian, remarkably accommodating of a Russian dictator and a secretary of state who has never served in the government, never written in a foreign-policy journal about great power relations or the U. S. relationship with Russia but whose entire experience has been in business negotiations with the Russian state and its offshoots in the oil industry. So yeah, I think when you talk about appearances of conflict of interest, you can talk about it as an ethicist or as a lawyer in the White House counsel's office, but there's a broader picture here which is where are we going with Russia? And where is this leadership - what is it thinking about the kind of relationship that it wants the United States to have with Putin? And how much is it willing to accommodate Putin in the world? BYLINE: You know, when you wrote the book \"Private Empire: ExxonMobil And American Power,\" he did not grant you interviews, but you spent a lot of time talking to people who knew him. You asked him some questions at news conferences. I'm just wondering what sense you got of him and his - is he smart? Is he thoughtful? Is he rigid or open-minded? COLL: He's smart. He's thoughtful. He's comfortable in his own skin. He's a good communicator. He can take a lot of questions and bat them around. He's used to being in front of audiences. He's used to answering questions. But I've been thinking about this because ExxonMobil is such a controlled environment that when they put him out in front of audiences or he goes to the Council on Foreign Relations and gives a prepared speech and then takes five questions - generally, pretty friendly - you know, that's an environment that he thrives in. And I think, behind closed doors, he must be very effective. I've been at private dinners at think tanks where he's appeared. You know, he's at ease. He can talk with lots of different people about lots of different subjects. He doesn't come across as overbearing or, you know, sort of, arrogant. But he has never confronted the kind of uncontrolled questioning and impertinent questioning that a secretary of state has to face, not just all those ornery reporters in the back of your plane everywhere you fly asking you everything that might be newsworthy for their organizations. But, you know, the secretary of state - almost distinctively among those cabinet jobs - they fly all over the world, and they stand in front of the local press. They stand with the leader in front of all kinds of local activists. They meet with the opposition party. They wander around the embassy. And, you know, the career diplomatic service - these people are not always deferential to their leaders. They are independent minded themselves. They'll speak up. This is not Exxon's way. You don't speak up and call the - question the boss's fundamental assumptions in front of an audience. But this is what secretaries of state deal with all the time. And you look at the experienced ones, the ones who have been around this as politicians - John Kerry is a pretty good example - I mean, that stuff is just like rain off his back. He's so used to being under that kind of scrutiny and to taking unfriendly or bizarre questions from time to time. So it will be very interesting, if he is confirmed, to watch how he comes out of the very controlled environment of ExxonMobil into the raucous world of transparent politics. BYLINE: One more question on the subject of potential conflicts of interest - you know, it has been American policy to battle the effects of climate change. We don't know how that will - what that will look like under the Trump administration. But if ExxonMobil is undertaking to drill in the Arctic and areas where, you know, sea ice is melting and pursuing, you know, a policy that presumes many decades of use of fossil fuels, does that put him, potentially, at odds with an important policy goal of the United States? COLL: Well, I suppose it depends on what President Trump's policy goal is. But, you know, absolutely - he's made plain over his leadership of ExxonMobil, notwithstanding the adjustments in public policy and communication that he has overseen that essentially he's inclined to think, OK - there is a risk of climate change. It's a serious risk. We get it. We're at the table. We're listening. We're talking. But we don't want to do anything to prevent the development of global energy, including fossil fuel energy, that would somehow deprive, say, developing societies of burning all the coal they need to fire up electricity and deliver electricity to poor areas and so on and so forth. And then when you get to the climate risk subject, he's given answers from time to time where he says, well, look, OK - even if it is serious, we're engineers. We'll adapt. We'll find a way out of this. And that is the school of thought that, you know, used to be a little bit more prominent than it is today, which is kind of adaptation as the solution. Who knows what that adaptation is? Not, presumably, higher seawalls but some kind of technological magic bullet that resolves all of this rather than preventing it in the first place. Now, on the diplomacy of climate change today, the problem that the Trump administration is going to confront is that the Paris Accord represents a true international consensus about the seriousness of the problem and pathways to address it before we get to catastrophic temperature change. And if the United States essentially tries to undermine that or walk away from it, as Trump has occasionally threatened and as ExxonMobil's record would suggest Tillerson would be inclined to do, all it's going to lead to is isolation because really this question of climate risk in the world - it's a settled political issue. Only in the United States and Australia do you still have science deniers in such prominent roles. And if you want leverage in Europe, if you want leverage in the developing world, you'd better be engaging around this in a serious way. The Trump administration may decide that's just not their priority. They'll walk away, let it die by a thousand cuts or even more actively try to undermine it. But if Tillerson is the pragmatist that his friends and allies say that he is, he's going to want to take a hard look at where this consensus leads in terms of international politics and American influence.

I'm Terry Gross. The CIA, the director of the FBI and the director of National Intelligence now agree that Russia was behind the hacking of the DNC and Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman John Podesta. And that part of Rush's goal was to help Donald Trump get elected. Last week, Hillary Clinton said to a gathering of her donors that the Russian hacks were ordered by Russian President Vladimir Putin, who had a personal beef against her. She said the grudge related to when, as secretary of state, she criticized Russia's 2011 parliamentary elections as neither free, nor fair. The elections were met with mass protests. Clinton says Putin blamed her for the, quote, \"outpouring of outrage by his own people,\" unquote. My guest Michael Crowley wrote about why the relationship between Hillary Clinton and Vladimir Putin has been so contentious in an article in Politico titled \"Putin's Revenge. \" Crowley is Politico's senior foreign affairs correspondent and has also been writing extensively about Donald Trump and Russia. A little later, we'll talk about the deals that led Trump to hold the 2013 Miss Universe pageant in Moscow and to partner with a Russian mixed martial arts heavyweight champion. Michael Crowley, welcome to FRESH AIR. MICHAEL CROWLEY: Thank you so much for having me. GROSS: So Hillary Clinton has said that Putin doesn't like her because he blames the 2011 post-election protests in Russia on her. But you trace his animosity toward her to the 1990s, when Bill Clinton was president of the U. S. and Boris Yeltsin was president of Russia. This was shortly after the fall of the Soviet Union. Bill Clinton was trying to improve relations with Russia. He and Yeltsin seemed to be getting along. Why didn't Putin like that? CROWLEY: Well, right. People called it the Bill and Boris show. And it was almost kind of slapstick. These two big burly guys who were bear hugging and back slapping and getting along great, although there were underlying tensions in their relationship. They were talking about a new future partnership in some ways between the U. S. and Russia. In fact, their conversations even included the possibility that Russia would one day join NATO which seems like a preposterous idea now. It was a far-off idea, but it was one that they explicitly discussed. Vladimir Putin, as a former security establishment man, KGB man who had recently, in effect, lost his job with the KGB in Eastern Germany because of the fall of communism and the Soviet Union, resented what was happening in this relationship. It appeared to him that Russia, which had once been the other global superpower competing with the United States throughout the Cold War and he had been a combatant in that fight as a member of the KGB, was now subordinate, a junior partner, a kind of kid brother almost. And you can kind of see it if you go back. It's really interesting. There's videos online of Clinton and Yeltsin. And it's often not a serious exchange that they're having. They're sort of joking around. And underlying that is the fact that Yeltsin really was a full-blown alcoholic by all indications and assessments of people in the Clinton administration at that time. I mean, he was an embarrassment to a lot of Russians. There's a story that Bill Clinton himself tells where Yeltsin is staying in Blair House on a state visit across the street from the White House and comes downstairs in the middle of the night, slips past his security guards and is intercepted by the Secret Service. Yeltsin, the president of Russia, is in his underpants demanding a pizza. And in one version of the story, he actually makes it out to Pennsylvania Avenue and tries to hail a taxi cab before he's sort of spirited back into Blair House. And I think that's sort of metaphorical for Putin's belief that Russia was being on some level humiliated, that Yeltsin was not a strong enough and disciplined enough leader. Russia's economy also fell into a terrible state. And many Russians blame the sort of Harvard whiz kid economic advisers who came over to Moscow to try to help them introduce capitalism for some of those problems. So I think Putin harbors resentments about that period of time. And what we're seeing is a long arc from that period, which for Putin now is culminating perhaps in a kind of redemption or even revenge. He has been wanting to get back Russia's seat at the table in global politics. No longer are - does the United States act first and tell Russia afterwards that we're going to do things. Russia now has a say in what's happening in Europe and in the Middle East in a way that it did not. And I think that that is very fundamental to understanding how Putin thinks about the United States and Russia right now. GROSS: So - but let's talk policy a little bit about when Bill Clinton was president and Hillary was first lady. What were some of the policy things regarding Russia that Putin objected to? CROWLEY: I mentioned the Russian economy. And Putin definitely has made it a project to try to strengthen Russia's economy, although that's a shaky project for him because Russia is so dependent on energy exports and oil exports. And Russia's economic fortunes have really risen and fallen with the fluctuations in the price of oil over the past 15 or so years since he took the presidency. But I think the bigger one is NATO. And when Bill Clinton came into office, he began a major drive to start expanding the NATO alliance into countries that had once been in the Iron Curtain, the Soviet sphere of influence. And the idea was that NATO would help to integrate and stabilize Europe, help spread democracy and Western American values throughout Europe, even into Eastern Europe. And also it's important to note, many of these countries in Eastern Europe wanted to join NATO, but Putin saw that as very threatening to Russia. He does not like NATO encroaching on Russia's borders. And again, I think found it to be kind of a humiliation, felt that Yeltsin sort of rolled over and took this even when a lot of members of the security and military establishment in Russia were telling him not to. GROSS: So let's jump ahead to when Hillary Clinton becomes secretary of state. President Obama had a policy toward Russia called reset, in an attempt to recalibrate our relationship with Russia. Why did it need recalibrating at that point? CROWLEY: Well, several presidents now have come into office trying to have better relationships with Russia, only to see them go sour. So even at the end of the Bill and Boris show, things were tense between Bill Clinton and actually Vladimir Putin, who came in to power just at the end of Clinton's presidency. George W. Bush came into office wanting to do business with Putin. People will remember that he famously said that he looked into Putin's soul and thought that he understood the man. And I think it goes back in part to that question of American influence and NATO expansion in Eastern Europe. Putin continued to see the U. S. or a U. S. -led NATO coalition building up. Expanding the Iraq war was an important signal to Putin that the U. S. was going to be acting militarily around the world without a lot of concern for what Russia thought. And he is particularly threatened by the idea of regime change operations as a sort of paranoid autocrat. The Bush administration also was very interested in promoting democracy civil society programs that were promoting Western values around the world in a way that Putin finds very threatening. And that sort of gets us toward what happened with Hillary Clinton. But so Barack Obama came in thinking he too could get things off on to a better foot, wanted to work with Russia on things like the Iran nuclear program and nuclear arms reductions, but that was a short-lived project. GROSS: So what did Hillary Clinton do to implement the reset program with Russia? CROWLEY: So Hillary Clinton was this sort of face of the reset. She very famously presented the Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov with a big red reset button. They actually got the Russian word slightly wrong and it was perhaps an omen that it got off to a kind of an awkward start. But she was the one who was doing the most communication with the Russian government, traveling to Moscow, meeting her counterpart and meeting Putin in different locations. And she was hopeful, as I think many in the Obama administration were, that business could be done with Putin's successor as president, Dmitry Medvedev. Putin was actually term-limited so he stepped out of power, I believe, in 2009 and took the job of prime minister and Medvedev became president. Medvedev was, you know, by all accounts much more interested in working with the West, less sort of paranoid and hostile towards the U. S. and its intentions. So Hillary dealt a lot with Medvedev, but then Putin announced that he would be coming back to power in 2011 and that's where things start to get complicated. GROSS: How did they get complicated? CROWLEY: (Laughter) Well, a lot of Russians are not happy about this idea that Putin's coming back. He had his two-term run. He's been hanging around. Now he says he wants to come back. It looks like there's a real autocrat in the making. And around this time, there are parliamentary elections in Russia that seem to have been rigged or have substantial, I guess, irregularities, as is the diplomatic term of art. And Hillary Clinton - and so large protests form in the streets of Moscow. It's December of 2011. Moscow's frigidly cold. And thousands of people are out, protesting about these elections in numbers not seen since Putin had taken power. And the protests start out to be directed toward these elections but actually become largely about frustration toward Putin. And a lot of the signs say things like Putin out, Putin must go. And Hillary Clinton sort of throws her support to the protesters. It's - she uses sort of gentle diplomatic language and says, you know, we're concerned about irregularities in these elections. And the Russian people should be free to determine their own political destiny. But Putin takes this as really kicking him when he's down, a grave threat to his power. And he's furious about it. GROSS: And so this is the incident that Hillary Clinton is referring to when she describes Putin as having a personal grudge against her. CROWLEY: That's right. And this is backed up by - for instance, the former U. S. ambassador to Moscow, Michael McFaul, says that he has heard Putin speak firsthand about this - that he was furious, again, that he felt that Hillary Clinton was undermining him at a moment of some weakness. And, you know, Putin has also suggested that the State Department was aiding the protesters in some potentially covert way - maybe financially. I spoke to a Russia expert for a story recently, a man based in Moscow who said that, at that time, the State Department was seen with even more suspicion than the CIA was during the Cold War. Now, that might've been hyperbole. But the point was that not only did Hillary say this thing in public. But Putin felt that she may have been actually using the State Department to support these protesters and kind of try to promote a soft coup. GROSS: Was there evidence that the U. S. was trying to support a soft coup? CROWLEY: No. I'm glad you asked me that. It's important to note that that's not the case. The U. S. does, of course, spend some money on democracy and civil-society programs. And I think there were some in Russia at the time. That stuff has now all been shut down, as Putin has really cracked down and established a kind of authoritarian state that brooks very little political dissent. But I want to briefly add that, more generally, you know, in a lot of these cases, I think that Putin has a kind of grain of truth to what he's saying and what he's resentful about but exaggerates it for political effect. Similarly, when it comes to these protests, I think, like so many foreign autocrats, he paints a picture of nefarious foreign influence to explain away genuine political dissent. So while Hillary did say what she said, I think the larger conspiracy is totally a fiction. GROSS: We're going have to take a short break here. And then we'll talk more about Russia and Donald Trump's Russian connections. If you're just joining us, my guest is Michael Crowley. He's the chief foreign affairs correspondent for Politico. We'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is Michael Crowley. He's the chief foreign affairs correspondent for Politico. So you describe Putin as really wanting to expand Russia's power again, become a major player again on the global stage. An example of that would be Russia's annexation of Crimea from the Ukraine, which further made for bad relations between the U. S. and Russia, since U. S. opposed that annexation. And there have been sanctions on Russia as a result of that. Russia wants an end to those sanctions. So we're still in a period of great tension between the U. S. and Russia. And now Donald Trump is president-elect. Are there ways in which you see President-elect Donald Trump's positions as being in sync with Russia? CROWLEY: Yes, absolutely. So you heard Trump say a lot of things as a candidate that were probably quite pleasing to Putin's ears. And I think that there is substantial overlap between what Trump has been saying and what Putin has been wanting the U. S. to do for a long time. One example would be for Trump to in effect recognize Putin's actions in Ukraine, the annexation of Crimea and his support for a pro-Russian insurgency in the East and lift U. S. sanctions on Russia that were imposed as punishment. Although, some of those were done by Congress. So Trump cannot undo them with the snap of his hand. But some he can because they were executive orders. The other is that Trump has shown skepticism toward the NATO alliance, which Putin finds highly threatening. And it's not clear that Trump is going to be a gung-ho supporter of NATO the way his past several predecessors have been. And that would go a long way toward making Vladimir Putin feel more comfortable with dealing with the U. S. and the West, for better or for worse. Trump has also said that the U. S. has no business trying to depose Bashar al-Assad, who is a client of Vladimir Putin. The Russians, of course, are now deeply militarily involved in Syria, trying to prop Assad up. The U. S. has been supporting, up to a limited point, Syrian rebels who are battling Assad. And Trump has suggested that he might cut off that support. Putin would be very happy about that. And it could lead to the possibility of military cooperation between the U. S. and Russia against ISIS. And just in general, we might see a normalization of relations between Washington and Moscow that we've not seen in a long time. Under Barack Obama and since the annexation of Crimea, there's been very little contact between the two governments. And I think that Trump, particularly if he has Rex Tillerson as his secretary of state, will have a lot of contact with Moscow. And that could open up other possibilities. GROSS: Well, I mean, Barack Obama wanted reset with Russia. He wanted to improve relations with Russia. So do you see any downside to Trump trying to improve relations with Russia? CROWLEY: Yes, I do. You know, first of all, it's not clear that he'll be able to do it. There's strong opposition in the Congress. You're seeing members like John McCain and Lindsey Graham kind of coming out guns blazing, even threatening the nomination of Rex Tillerson to be secretary of state, saying that Putin is a butcher and a thug, and we can't do business with him. The concern is that Trump has this kind of personal admiration for Putin that may blind him to Russia's real goals and to what America's strategic stake is in doing business with Russia. So, you know, if Trump cuts a deal with Putin that undermines the NATO alliance, that not only undoes decades of American policy but could destabilize Europe. It could lead Putin to think that he has more room to encroach on his neighbors, like the Baltics, than he does and could invite a conflict that would be very alarming. Some people also warn that Trump may think that Putin is a guy he can do business with. They are both similar men who are kind of macho. They don't brook dissent. They - they have a sort of strongman posture, and Trump seems to be attracted to these qualities in Putin. But what happens if they get into a room together, and it turns out they don't really hit it off, or Putin is asking for more than Trump is willing to give? Well, now you have two guys who, on the flip side, have big egos, who carry grudges, who get angry easily. And if there is a breakdown between them, it could get ugly very quickly with unpredictable consequences. GROSS: Donald Trump has also suggested that if countries don't pay their dues or pay the right amount in NATO, that, you know, they shouldn't be members. And I think the Baltic states - Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia - feel very threatened by that. So how does Trump's statements about NATO affect the potential Trump-Putin relationship? CROWLEY: Well, I think they make Putin very happy. And we talked earlier about how NATO was this great irritant for Putin and the Russian security state in the 1990s and the 2000s and even in the Obama years. And we're still seeing new members join NATO in sort of Russia's backyard. And yes, one of the most remarkable things Trump said in the campaign was that he might not honor the NATO Article 5 obligation of one member to defend another, the whole alliance to defend a member that comes under attack, if, Trump said, that member had not paid what he deemed to be its fair share of dues. There's no language in the NATO treaty that says exactly how much you have to pay. And this is music to Putin's ears. Putin despises NATO. He sees it as a hostile force. He spent his career, again, in the KGB trying to subvert and undermine NATO and thinking about the day when the Warsaw Pact might go to war with NATO. And now he sees it creeping up onto Russia's borders. So he would love to cut a deal with Trump, in which Trump maybe reduces American support for NATO or finds some way to pull back NATO forces that have been building up on its eastern border in the second Obama term. GROSS: Possibly opening up the door to Russian expansion. CROWLEY: Possibly opening up the door to Russian expansion. So the - the Baltics, of course, are terrified of this. I mean, they live in fear of some kind of Russian aggression almost any day. They have been pleading for more support from NATO, and Trump has shown no sign of being interested in that. And, in fact, one of the most alarming moments for - for Baltic leaders came during the campaign, when Newt Gingrich - who, of course, is very close to Trump - referred to Tallinn, the capital of Estonia, as basically a suburb of St. Petersburg, which did not go over well in that region. It was taken as a sense of, you know, Putin can have it if he wants it. It's his backyard. It's not our problem, which just abandons decades of American thinking about European security and its NATO commitments. GROSS: My guest is Michael Crowley, chief foreign affairs correspondent for Politico. After a break, he'll tell us about the deals that led Donald Trump to hold his Miss Universe pageant in Moscow and to partner with a Russian mixed martial arts heavyweight champion. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross, back with Politico's chief foreign affairs correspondent, Michael Crowley. He recently wrote about Hillary Clinton's strained relationship with Vladimir Putin and has been writing extensively about Donald Trump and his team's connections to Russia. These stories have been the subject of intense interest ever since U. S. intelligence agencies announced that Russia was behind the hacks of the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton's campaign chair, John Podesta. In August, that revelation helped lead to the resignation of Trump's campaign manager, Paul Manafort, because of his lobbying on behalf of leaders in Ukraine aligned with Russia. Is Paul Manafort, who had been Trump's campaign chair earlier in Trump's campaign - is he still connected to Trump? CROWLEY: So according to Politico's reporting, Manafort is still influential in an unofficial capacity. He still has ties to the campaign. He's still - or the transition now. He still communicates with Trump officials. He does not have an official role in the Trump transition. We haven't heard that he'll be joining the administration. GROSS: And he had ties to the former hardline president of Ukraine, Viktor Yanukovych. . . CROWLEY: Right. GROSS: . . . Who was connected with the Kremlin. CROWLEY: So Manafort is part of this story. He was essentially the political consultant to Yanukovych who was driven out by the uprising in Ukraine in early 2014 that set off this chain of events that really poisoned the U. S. -Russia relationship. After Yanukovych was driven out by popular protests, that's when Putin grabbed Crimea and began supporting the pro-Russian insurgency in eastern Ukraine. And in Putin's narrative, this was essentially a U. S. -EU-backed coup, driving out an ally of his and trying to pull Ukraine into the West. And Putin is saying, no way. You know, Russia has a historic claim to Ukraine. And I'm not going to tolerate this. And Manafort was Yanukovych's guy. So Manafort was intimately involved in the politics there. And there are other figures that he's connected to. He's done work for a Russian oligarch who is very, very close to Putin. We don't really know the full extent of his ties. But he's certainly part of this story. GROSS: So when he was campaign manager in Donald Trump's presidential campaign, is there any evidence that he had any influence on Donald Trump's positions or views on Russia? CROWLEY: It's hard to draw a direct, straight line. But, you know, it did seem that Trump was offering more opinions about Russia at that time. We also know that at the Republican convention this past summer, at which time Manafort was still running the campaign, there was an effort to put in tough language about Ukraine into the Republican Party platform. And Trump campaign officials blocked that effort. I believe that the language would have endorsed sending weapons to Ukraine to fight the Russian-backed insurgency. And Trump campaign officials saw to it that that language was knocked out of the platform. And there was speculation that that's the kind of thing that would likely have come from Manafort's level - that Trump wouldn't have been intimately involved in drawing up the platform. So, you know, a data point like that was a cause for concern for many observers. But we can't know for sure precisely what influence Manafort had. I would also just briefly add that there were other people in Trump's orbit, including Carter Page, who was a named campaign foreign-policy adviser, was on the board of Gazprom, which is a Russian energy company, traveled to Moscow during the campaign. The Trump team has since kind of disowned Carter Page. But Manafort was one of a handful of people with ties that really raised eyebrows. GROSS: Are you concerned about the possibility that some Trump-administration people or Trump-administration decisions will be based in part on business deals that led to personal gains in the past and favors that should be paid or repaid as a result of lucrative business deals in the past? - as opposed to based solely on what's in America's best interests. CROWLEY: Well, I think that absolutely has to be a concern. And so to the extent that Paul Manafort still wields influence, is he trying to do favors for his friends back in Ukraine and Moscow when he calls Trump officials and possibly even Trump himself? Terry, there's something bigger here which is not Rex Tillerson's oil deals or Paul Manafort's political consulting in Ukraine. It's the way Trump talks about Putin and Russia. There's something mysterious about it. There's something that I think we don't completely understand. And I like to talk about it in terms of - you know, there's this concept in astrophysics, dark matter in the universe. And it's this stuff that holds the universe together. But we can't see it. We know it's out there. We know it has some kind of gravitational pull. But we can't define exactly what it is. And with Trump and Putin, there is this very strange way in which Trump constantly forgives Putin for his bad actions. He dismisses accusations against Putin. He says - he finds alternate explanations. Just to give you a couple quick examples, we have all followed the story of the Russian hacking during this election. And Trump has been very reluctant to admit that this actually happened. You know, and he said, you never know. It could be a 400-pound guy sitting on his mother's bed. But it goes back much farther. You know, when Trump was asked about whether Putin has political opponents and journalists killed, Trump said, well, you don't know that. People say that he does it. But I don't know if it's true. When the passenger jet MH17 was shot down over Ukraine a couple of years ago, and international investigation concluded, this was supported by all kinds of Western intelligence agencies - that the plane was shot down by pro-Russian separatists using a missile supplied by Moscow. Trump was asked about that. And he said, well, people say that. But you don't know. And there's other theories out there. Even the poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko, the Russian who drank polonium from a tea cup in London and died after that - he was a big Putin critic. Trump has been asked about that - same thing. We don't know. We don't know. He seems almost, you know, willfully blind to this pattern of Putin's actions in a way that doesn't add up. It makes you think that there's something going on that we don't completely understand. And that's really frustrating and, I think, for a lot of people, very troubling. GROSS: What kind of frustration does that pose for you as a journalist? CROWLEY: (Laughter) Well, I mean, on the positive side, it's an incredible story. And it makes me and a lot of other journalists want to keep digging. And we feel like we're chasing this incredible mystery that would - that could be, you know, a Titanic story if it turns out, as some people theorize, that Trump has some financial obligations that he hasn't disclosed. Remember, we haven't seen his tax returns. If he, in some way - if Putin has leverage on him that could be personal. Some people have raised the fact that Trump traveled to Moscow in 2013. And on that trip, he would have been, you know, surveilled by the Russians. They would've probably been trying to hack into all his communications. So some people say, do the Russians have something on him? This is all very speculative. The positive thing is it's an amazing and fascinating story. But it's incredibly frustrating to know how to deal with this. How do you talk about it? I mean, even now I'm dealing - sort of pushing the boundaries of speculation. With other presidents, you can go back and analyze their speeches and policy papers from their senior aides and kind of put it into theories of geopolitics. But none of that applies here. So we sort of lack a traditional framework. And so I find myself trying to turn to new ways of understanding this guy, which is both intellectually interesting and gratifying but also, so long as we're unable to answer the question, really frustrating. GROSS: Well, let's get to some of those new ways of trying to understand President-elect Trump. But first we have to take a short break. If you're just joining us, my guest is Michael Crowley. He's the chief foreign affairs correspondent for Politico. We'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is Michael Crowley. He's the chief foreign affairs correspondent for Politico, and he's been writing a lot about Donald Trump and Russia. As you've said, because Donald Trump has revealed so little about his finances and because we have no record of past political positions in the sense that he's never had elected office before, you have to find new ways of trying to understand who he is, what his positions are, what his positions might be in the future. You've gone back and investigated some of his business deals. My understanding is that Donald Trump has been interested in having real estate deals in Russia, but hasn't had any real estate deals there. But he has had other things. One of the things we've heard him talk about with pride is the Miss Universe pageant, which was held in Russia in 2013. Does he still own the Miss Universe pageant? CROWLEY: He sold the Miss Universe pageant, I think, in 2014. But at the time he took it to Moscow, he was the owner and seemed quite delighted to be bringing it to Russia. GROSS: And I think he cited this as part of the foundation of how he knows so much about Russia. CROWLEY: Yeah, he did. I think it was during the primary campaign. And he had started talking a fair amount about Putin and Russia and he was asked what his basis for understanding Russia was and he cited this trip he took to Moscow for the Miss Universe pageant in 2013. And, you know, I thought that was amazing and I wanted to know more about this trip so I wrote a story where I dove in and learned everything I could about it. And it's still a little murky. I mean, we know that he took business meetings there. He seems to have been exploring real estate deals when he was there, but hasn't fully disclosed everyone he talked to everything, he was trying to do. My favorite part of this - and this goes back, Terry, to what I was saying a couple of minutes ago about the dark matter and the mysterious attraction to Putin - when he was headed over there, he started tweeting about Vladimir Putin and essentially inviting Putin to attend the pageant via Twitter. And in one kind of remarkable tweet that was almost written in the voice of, like, a teenage boy he said something to the effect of, you know, really excited for the Miss Universe pageant in Moscow tomorrow night or whenever it was. Do you think Vladimir Putin will come, and will he be my best friend? GROSS: (Laughter). CROWLEY: Which is just an incredible thing. And apparently - and I credit The Washington Post, which has done some good follow up reporting on this - apparently Trump thought Putin might actually attend. Putin did not attend, but he sent a gift, some kind of like an ornate jewelry box or something to that effect and a note. So Putin was aware that Trump was there and wanted him to come, but did not actually attend the pageant. GROSS: Well, you looked into how Trump decided to hold the 2013 Miss Universe pageant in Moscow and it was with the help of a billionaire Russian real estate mogul with ties to Vladimir Putin. And with this mogul's son, Emin - am I pronouncing his name right? CROWLEY: I think it's Emin. GROSS: Emin, OK. You describe him as a dance-pop singer with ambitions to international stardom. So what's the connection between this Russian real estate mogul, his would-be pop star son and Trump bringing Miss Universe to Moscow? CROWLEY: Well, this story was so much fun to explore. And I had no idea going in that this would be the case, but it seems that Trump wound up coming to Moscow because the son of this billionaire sort of real estate developer in Moscow had made a video for one of his pop songs featuring a former Miss Universe. And in the video he's chasing her through the streets at night and it's a kind of, you know, maudlin love song. And because of the Miss Universe connection, this pop singer is able to establish a line to Trump I think through the agent of the woman who had been in the video. And that starts a conversation that I guess revolves around Miss Universe and beautiful women and Moscow being a great place. And the path brings Trump to Moscow with his pageant. GROSS: Well, and the mogul who's the father of the pop star, he persuaded Trump not only to bring it to Moscow but to hold it. . . CROWLEY: Yes. GROSS: . . . In the concert hall that this billionaire Russian mogul owns (laughter). So there's definitely something in it for him. . . CROWLEY: Yes. GROSS: . . . To have Trump bring the pageant to Moscow. CROWLEY: Yes, absolutely. So they in effect do business together on the pageant. And I believe that they were discussing real estate projects in Moscow that went beyond the pageant, had nothing to do with the pageant, when Trump was there. And this is a guy who's, by the way, very powerful, has connections to the Kremlin, has gotten a lot of big contracts from the Kremlin. So he would be a good person to know. And kind of beautifully closing the loop on all this, Trump goes over there. They have the pageant. He hangs out with these guys. And the son, Emin, makes another music video in which it starts with him sitting in some kind of dull boardroom meeting and he dozes off. And the scene cuts and he wakes up in his apartment and he's in some dream fantasy. And all these Miss Universe contestants are sort of tromping around his apartment in bikinis and high heels while he's, like, sipping his coffee in his sweatpants. And so this goes on for a few minutes and then at the end of the video, he wakes up from his dream. He's back in the boardroom and, of course, it's Donald Trump sitting at the head of the table. And he's seen Emin doze off and he says, Emin, you're fired. Which of course is his signature line from \"The Apprentice. \" So everybody got something out of that trip, it seems. GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is Michael Crowley. He's the chief foreign affairs correspondent for Politico. We're going to take a short break and be right back. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is Michael Crowley. He's the chief foreign affairs correspondent for Politico. So there's a story I want you to tell that's also about Donald Trump's business connections to Russia. And this is actually a martial arts story because he teamed up with a business partner who was described as the king of mixed martial arts in Russia. And his name was - you say it. I'm - I think I'm going to get the pronunciation wrong on it. CROWLEY: Fedor (laughter). GROSS: OK. So who was Fedor, and how did he team up with Trump? CROWLEY: So Fedor - Emelianenko, I think, is his last name - was a major mixed martial arts figure in Russia. And he was a tough fighter. He was kind of the Mike Tyson of mixed martial arts. You know, would, you know, knock people out, you know, within a minute of the fight. Trump once said about Fedor, quote, \"his thing is inflicting death on people. \" And although I'm pretty sure Fedor never actually killed anyone, that was sort of his reputation. You know, if you fight Fedor, you're going to feel the pain. So Fedor also happened to be friends with Vladimir Putin, who frequently would sit in the front row at Fedor's fights and went on to appoint Fedor to a state sort of athletic body. All of which was very interesting when I discovered that Donald Trump also had a relationship with Fedor. And this was when Trump was enlisted by some kind of entrepreneurial guys in the world of mixed martial arts to back an MMA league that they were starting up to compete with the - sort of the established league, Ultimate Fighting Championship. So his big star with whom he appeared at press conferences - this was in 2008, just so people have a sense of the timeline. Well before he ran for president. His big star is a guy who is buddies with Putin and a big hero in Russia. And in addition to this, there is a plan which is described in a press release that was put out by this league, which I think was called Affliction Entertainment, which promises a reality show that will be based in St. Petersburg, Russia where up-and-comers get to compete for the chance to fight Fedor. Its going to be called \"Fighting Fedor. \" And Trump, I believe, was going to be the executive producer, and in the press release said that he would even be going to St. Petersburg for the show. So this league doesn't do very well. It's a fiasco. It seems never to have been very well organized or thought-out. They stage, I think, maybe three pay-per-view events and basically declare bankruptcy. And it ends in litigation, and everyone's mad at each other. But, Terry, it's just one more example of Trump having ties to business in a relationship with Russia that kind of makes you scratch your head. And I want to underscore again there's a lot that's great about Russia. And I think sometimes it is true that we get carried away in the U. S. with Russia phobia, which is not to say that Putin has not done a lot of really terrible things. But it's not that there's anything wrong with doing business in Russia. It's just - it's not clear what ties all this together. Why is Trump so interested in Russia? Why does Trump have this disproportionate amount of activity and interest in and affinity toward Russia? And the story of Fedor is one more mysterious data point. GROSS: So in both of the stories that you told, the one about the mixed martial arts and the other about the Miss Universe pageant, Donald Trump's main connections have been to billionaires in Russia. CROWLEY: Right. And Trump has other relations to very wealthy Russians. And I think this is important to include in our conversation, you know. Again, we don't know what his precise financial ties, dealings, obligations are because we haven't seen his tax returns. But there is a body of evidence to suggest that, you know, Russian money has played an important role in his real estate projects. So there are real estate deals he wanted to do in Russia that never got off the ground. But we've seen, for instance, his son saying that - a few years ago at a conference - that Russians make up a disproportionate or significant - I forget the precise word he used - amount of the money that they're making on their properties. And we also know that Trump once sold a mansion in Palm Beach for $100 million, which at the time was the highest sale price on a real estate deal, to a Russian oligarch. But he seems to know quite a lot of oligarchs. GROSS: So I want to change the subject here. One of the questions hanging over the election is the Russian hack of Democratic emails, of the DNC, of John Podesta. And the American intelligence agencies agree that those were Russian hacks. But one way or another, those documents that were published and written about in the press were the results of a criminal hack by a foreign country. So as a journalist covering foreign affairs, writing extensively about Trump and Russia, did you think through a lot whether it was appropriate to publish those documents and whether publishing those documents were, in some way, helping Russia do its work in, you know, messing around with our democracy? CROWLEY: I did think about this a lot, Terry. And I think that very serious and intelligent people can disagree. I did not write about the emails myself - I think with one exception relating to an email from the Obama-Bush transition in 2008 that had to do with the Bush administration's policy on Iraq, so kind of a long ago matter that didn't really have anything to do with the actors in the campaign. But people can make their own judgment about whether even that was appropriate to write about. But it's very hard for a news organization. It's - I guess it's a kind of a form of game theory. You know, if everybody's doing it and you're the only one not doing it, what are you accomplishing? I mean, do you - does it look like you're kind of taking yourself out of a conversation? Are you cutting off your ability to help people understand what's happening? Or do you stand on principle? And I guess, again, different people reach different conclusions. I myself wasn't enthusiastic about the coverage of the emails. And I think that it would be great - it's happening to some degree now - but I would love to see a more robust, deep, ongoing conversation about what to do when the next one of these things happens because it will. And I think that that conversation was not sufficiently had after the Sony email hack by the North Korean government. And, again, in that case, everyone just ran with the emails and, I think, didn't consider the implications of it. And you have to have that conversation before the next wave. And I'll just add, Terry, that, you know, one of (laughter) the most interesting and somewhat unsettling questions in play right now is, what else do they have? I don't think we can assume that everything the Russians got is out. And I don't think we can assume that if more stuff comes it's only going to involve Democrats. It's quite possible that there is material on Republicans and possibly even Trump himself which the Russians could use strategically, particularly if the relationship starts to hit a bad patch again. GROSS: You're talking about blackmail really, right? CROWLEY: Potentially. I mean, I can't say that I know that there is specific information that would be used that way. I can say that there is - I mean, any sane person who's following this can understand how easy it is to get material that's compromising, that embarrasses people. And when you talk to security experts and foreign policy experts, they all seem to think that the odds are very high that the Russians have a lot more stuff and that we don't know what it is. And that would fit a Russian pattern. They blackmail people all the time. They destroy opponents with embarrassing information or videotapes. They even plant false information. The word is kompromat. The New York Times did an excellent story a week or two ago about a - I believe he was, like, a Russian political dissident living outside of the country who had child pornography found on his computer by the authorities. And there seems to be compelling evidence that it was planted on him. So we need to have smart conversations now about how the press will deal with that stuff when it happens again. But I fear that the media ecosystem now is so atomized and so decentralized that even that conversation may not really provide thoughtful guidance as opposed to just a frenzy in the moment. GROSS: Well, Michael Crowley, I want to thank you so much for talking with us. CROWLEY: It's been a great pleasure. Thank you for having me. GROSS: Michael Crowley is Politico's chief foreign affairs correspondent. TERRY GROSS, HOST:  This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. The CIA, the director of the FBI and the director of National Intelligence now agree that Russia was behind the hacking of the DNC and Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman John Podesta. And that part of Rush's goal was to help Donald Trump get elected. Last week, Hillary Clinton said to a gathering of her donors that the Russian hacks were ordered by Russian President Vladimir Putin, who had a personal beef against her. She said the grudge related to when, as secretary of state, she criticized Russia's 2011 parliamentary elections as neither free, nor fair. The elections were met with mass protests. Clinton says Putin blamed her for the, quote, \"outpouring of outrage by his own people,\" unquote. My guest Michael Crowley wrote about why the relationship between Hillary Clinton and Vladimir Putin has been so contentious in an article in Politico titled \"Putin's Revenge. \" Crowley is Politico's senior foreign affairs correspondent and has also been writing extensively about Donald Trump and Russia. A little later, we'll talk about the deals that led Trump to hold the 2013 Miss Universe pageant in Moscow and to partner with a Russian mixed martial arts heavyweight champion. Michael Crowley, welcome to FRESH AIR. MICHAEL CROWLEY: Thank you so much for having me. GROSS: So Hillary Clinton has said that Putin doesn't like her because he blames the 2011 post-election protests in Russia on her. But you trace his animosity toward her to the 1990s, when Bill Clinton was president of the U. S. and Boris Yeltsin was president of Russia. This was shortly after the fall of the Soviet Union. Bill Clinton was trying to improve relations with Russia. He and Yeltsin seemed to be getting along. Why didn't Putin like that? CROWLEY: Well, right. People called it the Bill and Boris show. And it was almost kind of slapstick. These two big burly guys who were bear hugging and back slapping and getting along great, although there were underlying tensions in their relationship. They were talking about a new future partnership in some ways between the U. S. and Russia. In fact, their conversations even included the possibility that Russia would one day join NATO which seems like a preposterous idea now. It was a far-off idea, but it was one that they explicitly discussed. Vladimir Putin, as a former security establishment man, KGB man who had recently, in effect, lost his job with the KGB in Eastern Germany because of the fall of communism and the Soviet Union, resented what was happening in this relationship. It appeared to him that Russia, which had once been the other global superpower competing with the United States throughout the Cold War and he had been a combatant in that fight as a member of the KGB, was now subordinate, a junior partner, a kind of kid brother almost. And you can kind of see it if you go back. It's really interesting. There's videos online of Clinton and Yeltsin. And it's often not a serious exchange that they're having. They're sort of joking around. And underlying that is the fact that Yeltsin really was a full-blown alcoholic by all indications and assessments of people in the Clinton administration at that time. I mean, he was an embarrassment to a lot of Russians. There's a story that Bill Clinton himself tells where Yeltsin is staying in Blair House on a state visit across the street from the White House and comes downstairs in the middle of the night, slips past his security guards and is intercepted by the Secret Service. Yeltsin, the president of Russia, is in his underpants demanding a pizza. And in one version of the story, he actually makes it out to Pennsylvania Avenue and tries to hail a taxi cab before he's sort of spirited back into Blair House. And I think that's sort of metaphorical for Putin's belief that Russia was being on some level humiliated, that Yeltsin was not a strong enough and disciplined enough leader. Russia's economy also fell into a terrible state. And many Russians blame the sort of Harvard whiz kid economic advisers who came over to Moscow to try to help them introduce capitalism for some of those problems. So I think Putin harbors resentments about that period of time. And what we're seeing is a long arc from that period, which for Putin now is culminating perhaps in a kind of redemption or even revenge. He has been wanting to get back Russia's seat at the table in global politics. No longer are - does the United States act first and tell Russia afterwards that we're going to do things. Russia now has a say in what's happening in Europe and in the Middle East in a way that it did not. And I think that that is very fundamental to understanding how Putin thinks about the United States and Russia right now. GROSS: So - but let's talk policy a little bit about when Bill Clinton was president and Hillary was first lady. What were some of the policy things regarding Russia that Putin objected to? CROWLEY: I mentioned the Russian economy. And Putin definitely has made it a project to try to strengthen Russia's economy, although that's a shaky project for him because Russia is so dependent on energy exports and oil exports. And Russia's economic fortunes have really risen and fallen with the fluctuations in the price of oil over the past 15 or so years since he took the presidency. But I think the bigger one is NATO. And when Bill Clinton came into office, he began a major drive to start expanding the NATO alliance into countries that had once been in the Iron Curtain, the Soviet sphere of influence. And the idea was that NATO would help to integrate and stabilize Europe, help spread democracy and Western American values throughout Europe, even into Eastern Europe. And also it's important to note, many of these countries in Eastern Europe wanted to join NATO, but Putin saw that as very threatening to Russia. He does not like NATO encroaching on Russia's borders. And again, I think found it to be kind of a humiliation, felt that Yeltsin sort of rolled over and took this even when a lot of members of the security and military establishment in Russia were telling him not to. GROSS: So let's jump ahead to when Hillary Clinton becomes secretary of state. President Obama had a policy toward Russia called reset, in an attempt to recalibrate our relationship with Russia. Why did it need recalibrating at that point? CROWLEY: Well, several presidents now have come into office trying to have better relationships with Russia, only to see them go sour. So even at the end of the Bill and Boris show, things were tense between Bill Clinton and actually Vladimir Putin, who came in to power just at the end of Clinton's presidency. George W. Bush came into office wanting to do business with Putin. People will remember that he famously said that he looked into Putin's soul and thought that he understood the man. And I think it goes back in part to that question of American influence and NATO expansion in Eastern Europe. Putin continued to see the U. S. or a U. S. -led NATO coalition building up. Expanding the Iraq war was an important signal to Putin that the U. S. was going to be acting militarily around the world without a lot of concern for what Russia thought. And he is particularly threatened by the idea of regime change operations as a sort of paranoid autocrat. The Bush administration also was very interested in promoting democracy civil society programs that were promoting Western values around the world in a way that Putin finds very threatening. And that sort of gets us toward what happened with Hillary Clinton. But so Barack Obama came in thinking he too could get things off on to a better foot, wanted to work with Russia on things like the Iran nuclear program and nuclear arms reductions, but that was a short-lived project. GROSS: So what did Hillary Clinton do to implement the reset program with Russia? CROWLEY: So Hillary Clinton was this sort of face of the reset. She very famously presented the Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov with a big red reset button. They actually got the Russian word slightly wrong and it was perhaps an omen that it got off to a kind of an awkward start. But she was the one who was doing the most communication with the Russian government, traveling to Moscow, meeting her counterpart and meeting Putin in different locations. And she was hopeful, as I think many in the Obama administration were, that business could be done with Putin's successor as president, Dmitry Medvedev. Putin was actually term-limited so he stepped out of power, I believe, in 2009 and took the job of prime minister and Medvedev became president. Medvedev was, you know, by all accounts much more interested in working with the West, less sort of paranoid and hostile towards the U. S. and its intentions. So Hillary dealt a lot with Medvedev, but then Putin announced that he would be coming back to power in 2011 and that's where things start to get complicated. GROSS: How did they get complicated? CROWLEY: (Laughter) Well, a lot of Russians are not happy about this idea that Putin's coming back. He had his two-term run. He's been hanging around. Now he says he wants to come back. It looks like there's a real autocrat in the making. And around this time, there are parliamentary elections in Russia that seem to have been rigged or have substantial, I guess, irregularities, as is the diplomatic term of art. And Hillary Clinton - and so large protests form in the streets of Moscow. It's December of 2011. Moscow's frigidly cold. And thousands of people are out, protesting about these elections in numbers not seen since Putin had taken power. And the protests start out to be directed toward these elections but actually become largely about frustration toward Putin. And a lot of the signs say things like Putin out, Putin must go. And Hillary Clinton sort of throws her support to the protesters. It's - she uses sort of gentle diplomatic language and says, you know, we're concerned about irregularities in these elections. And the Russian people should be free to determine their own political destiny. But Putin takes this as really kicking him when he's down, a grave threat to his power. And he's furious about it. GROSS: And so this is the incident that Hillary Clinton is referring to when she describes Putin as having a personal grudge against her. CROWLEY: That's right. And this is backed up by - for instance, the former U. S. ambassador to Moscow, Michael McFaul, says that he has heard Putin speak firsthand about this - that he was furious, again, that he felt that Hillary Clinton was undermining him at a moment of some weakness. And, you know, Putin has also suggested that the State Department was aiding the protesters in some potentially covert way - maybe financially. I spoke to a Russia expert for a story recently, a man based in Moscow who said that, at that time, the State Department was seen with even more suspicion than the CIA was during the Cold War. Now, that might've been hyperbole. But the point was that not only did Hillary say this thing in public. But Putin felt that she may have been actually using the State Department to support these protesters and kind of try to promote a soft coup. GROSS: Was there evidence that the U. S. was trying to support a soft coup? CROWLEY: No. I'm glad you asked me that. It's important to note that that's not the case. The U. S. does, of course, spend some money on democracy and civil-society programs. And I think there were some in Russia at the time. That stuff has now all been shut down, as Putin has really cracked down and established a kind of authoritarian state that brooks very little political dissent. But I want to briefly add that, more generally, you know, in a lot of these cases, I think that Putin has a kind of grain of truth to what he's saying and what he's resentful about but exaggerates it for political effect. Similarly, when it comes to these protests, I think, like so many foreign autocrats, he paints a picture of nefarious foreign influence to explain away genuine political dissent. So while Hillary did say what she said, I think the larger conspiracy is totally a fiction. GROSS: We're going have to take a short break here. And then we'll talk more about Russia and Donald Trump's Russian connections. If you're just joining us, my guest is Michael Crowley. He's the chief foreign affairs correspondent for Politico. We'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is Michael Crowley. He's the chief foreign affairs correspondent for Politico. So you describe Putin as really wanting to expand Russia's power again, become a major player again on the global stage. An example of that would be Russia's annexation of Crimea from the Ukraine, which further made for bad relations between the U. S. and Russia, since U. S. opposed that annexation. And there have been sanctions on Russia as a result of that. Russia wants an end to those sanctions. So we're still in a period of great tension between the U. S. and Russia. And now Donald Trump is president-elect. Are there ways in which you see President-elect Donald Trump's positions as being in sync with Russia? CROWLEY: Yes, absolutely. So you heard Trump say a lot of things as a candidate that were probably quite pleasing to Putin's ears. And I think that there is substantial overlap between what Trump has been saying and what Putin has been wanting the U. S. to do for a long time. One example would be for Trump to in effect recognize Putin's actions in Ukraine, the annexation of Crimea and his support for a pro-Russian insurgency in the East and lift U. S. sanctions on Russia that were imposed as punishment. Although, some of those were done by Congress. So Trump cannot undo them with the snap of his hand. But some he can because they were executive orders. The other is that Trump has shown skepticism toward the NATO alliance, which Putin finds highly threatening. And it's not clear that Trump is going to be a gung-ho supporter of NATO the way his past several predecessors have been. And that would go a long way toward making Vladimir Putin feel more comfortable with dealing with the U. S. and the West, for better or for worse. Trump has also said that the U. S. has no business trying to depose Bashar al-Assad, who is a client of Vladimir Putin. The Russians, of course, are now deeply militarily involved in Syria, trying to prop Assad up. The U. S. has been supporting, up to a limited point, Syrian rebels who are battling Assad. And Trump has suggested that he might cut off that support. Putin would be very happy about that. And it could lead to the possibility of military cooperation between the U. S. and Russia against ISIS. And just in general, we might see a normalization of relations between Washington and Moscow that we've not seen in a long time. Under Barack Obama and since the annexation of Crimea, there's been very little contact between the two governments. And I think that Trump, particularly if he has Rex Tillerson as his secretary of state, will have a lot of contact with Moscow. And that could open up other possibilities. GROSS: Well, I mean, Barack Obama wanted reset with Russia. He wanted to improve relations with Russia. So do you see any downside to Trump trying to improve relations with Russia? CROWLEY: Yes, I do. You know, first of all, it's not clear that he'll be able to do it. There's strong opposition in the Congress. You're seeing members like John McCain and Lindsey Graham kind of coming out guns blazing, even threatening the nomination of Rex Tillerson to be secretary of state, saying that Putin is a butcher and a thug, and we can't do business with him. The concern is that Trump has this kind of personal admiration for Putin that may blind him to Russia's real goals and to what America's strategic stake is in doing business with Russia. So, you know, if Trump cuts a deal with Putin that undermines the NATO alliance, that not only undoes decades of American policy but could destabilize Europe. It could lead Putin to think that he has more room to encroach on his neighbors, like the Baltics, than he does and could invite a conflict that would be very alarming. Some people also warn that Trump may think that Putin is a guy he can do business with. They are both similar men who are kind of macho. They don't brook dissent. They - they have a sort of strongman posture, and Trump seems to be attracted to these qualities in Putin. But what happens if they get into a room together, and it turns out they don't really hit it off, or Putin is asking for more than Trump is willing to give? Well, now you have two guys who, on the flip side, have big egos, who carry grudges, who get angry easily. And if there is a breakdown between them, it could get ugly very quickly with unpredictable consequences. GROSS: Donald Trump has also suggested that if countries don't pay their dues or pay the right amount in NATO, that, you know, they shouldn't be members. And I think the Baltic states - Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia - feel very threatened by that. So how does Trump's statements about NATO affect the potential Trump-Putin relationship? CROWLEY: Well, I think they make Putin very happy. And we talked earlier about how NATO was this great irritant for Putin and the Russian security state in the 1990s and the 2000s and even in the Obama years. And we're still seeing new members join NATO in sort of Russia's backyard. And yes, one of the most remarkable things Trump said in the campaign was that he might not honor the NATO Article 5 obligation of one member to defend another, the whole alliance to defend a member that comes under attack, if, Trump said, that member had not paid what he deemed to be its fair share of dues. There's no language in the NATO treaty that says exactly how much you have to pay. And this is music to Putin's ears. Putin despises NATO. He sees it as a hostile force. He spent his career, again, in the KGB trying to subvert and undermine NATO and thinking about the day when the Warsaw Pact might go to war with NATO. And now he sees it creeping up onto Russia's borders. So he would love to cut a deal with Trump, in which Trump maybe reduces American support for NATO or finds some way to pull back NATO forces that have been building up on its eastern border in the second Obama term. GROSS: Possibly opening up the door to Russian expansion. CROWLEY: Possibly opening up the door to Russian expansion. So the - the Baltics, of course, are terrified of this. I mean, they live in fear of some kind of Russian aggression almost any day. They have been pleading for more support from NATO, and Trump has shown no sign of being interested in that. And, in fact, one of the most alarming moments for - for Baltic leaders came during the campaign, when Newt Gingrich - who, of course, is very close to Trump - referred to Tallinn, the capital of Estonia, as basically a suburb of St. Petersburg, which did not go over well in that region. It was taken as a sense of, you know, Putin can have it if he wants it. It's his backyard. It's not our problem, which just abandons decades of American thinking about European security and its NATO commitments. GROSS: My guest is Michael Crowley, chief foreign affairs correspondent for Politico. After a break, he'll tell us about the deals that led Donald Trump to hold his Miss Universe pageant in Moscow and to partner with a Russian mixed martial arts heavyweight champion. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross, back with Politico's chief foreign affairs correspondent, Michael Crowley. He recently wrote about Hillary Clinton's strained relationship with Vladimir Putin and has been writing extensively about Donald Trump and his team's connections to Russia. These stories have been the subject of intense interest ever since U. S. intelligence agencies announced that Russia was behind the hacks of the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton's campaign chair, John Podesta. In August, that revelation helped lead to the resignation of Trump's campaign manager, Paul Manafort, because of his lobbying on behalf of leaders in Ukraine aligned with Russia. Is Paul Manafort, who had been Trump's campaign chair earlier in Trump's campaign - is he still connected to Trump? CROWLEY: So according to Politico's reporting, Manafort is still influential in an unofficial capacity. He still has ties to the campaign. He's still - or the transition now. He still communicates with Trump officials. He does not have an official role in the Trump transition. We haven't heard that he'll be joining the administration. GROSS: And he had ties to the former hardline president of Ukraine, Viktor Yanukovych. . . CROWLEY: Right. GROSS: . . . Who was connected with the Kremlin. CROWLEY: So Manafort is part of this story. He was essentially the political consultant to Yanukovych who was driven out by the uprising in Ukraine in early 2014 that set off this chain of events that really poisoned the U. S. -Russia relationship. After Yanukovych was driven out by popular protests, that's when Putin grabbed Crimea and began supporting the pro-Russian insurgency in eastern Ukraine. And in Putin's narrative, this was essentially a U. S. -EU-backed coup, driving out an ally of his and trying to pull Ukraine into the West. And Putin is saying, no way. You know, Russia has a historic claim to Ukraine. And I'm not going to tolerate this. And Manafort was Yanukovych's guy. So Manafort was intimately involved in the politics there. And there are other figures that he's connected to. He's done work for a Russian oligarch who is very, very close to Putin. We don't really know the full extent of his ties. But he's certainly part of this story. GROSS: So when he was campaign manager in Donald Trump's presidential campaign, is there any evidence that he had any influence on Donald Trump's positions or views on Russia? CROWLEY: It's hard to draw a direct, straight line. But, you know, it did seem that Trump was offering more opinions about Russia at that time. We also know that at the Republican convention this past summer, at which time Manafort was still running the campaign, there was an effort to put in tough language about Ukraine into the Republican Party platform. And Trump campaign officials blocked that effort. I believe that the language would have endorsed sending weapons to Ukraine to fight the Russian-backed insurgency. And Trump campaign officials saw to it that that language was knocked out of the platform. And there was speculation that that's the kind of thing that would likely have come from Manafort's level - that Trump wouldn't have been intimately involved in drawing up the platform. So, you know, a data point like that was a cause for concern for many observers. But we can't know for sure precisely what influence Manafort had. I would also just briefly add that there were other people in Trump's orbit, including Carter Page, who was a named campaign foreign-policy adviser, was on the board of Gazprom, which is a Russian energy company, traveled to Moscow during the campaign. The Trump team has since kind of disowned Carter Page. But Manafort was one of a handful of people with ties that really raised eyebrows. GROSS: Are you concerned about the possibility that some Trump-administration people or Trump-administration decisions will be based in part on business deals that led to personal gains in the past and favors that should be paid or repaid as a result of lucrative business deals in the past? - as opposed to based solely on what's in America's best interests. CROWLEY: Well, I think that absolutely has to be a concern. And so to the extent that Paul Manafort still wields influence, is he trying to do favors for his friends back in Ukraine and Moscow when he calls Trump officials and possibly even Trump himself? Terry, there's something bigger here which is not Rex Tillerson's oil deals or Paul Manafort's political consulting in Ukraine. It's the way Trump talks about Putin and Russia. There's something mysterious about it. There's something that I think we don't completely understand. And I like to talk about it in terms of - you know, there's this concept in astrophysics, dark matter in the universe. And it's this stuff that holds the universe together. But we can't see it. We know it's out there. We know it has some kind of gravitational pull. But we can't define exactly what it is. And with Trump and Putin, there is this very strange way in which Trump constantly forgives Putin for his bad actions. He dismisses accusations against Putin. He says - he finds alternate explanations. Just to give you a couple quick examples, we have all followed the story of the Russian hacking during this election. And Trump has been very reluctant to admit that this actually happened. You know, and he said, you never know. It could be a 400-pound guy sitting on his mother's bed. But it goes back much farther. You know, when Trump was asked about whether Putin has political opponents and journalists killed, Trump said, well, you don't know that. People say that he does it. But I don't know if it's true. When the passenger jet MH17 was shot down over Ukraine a couple of years ago, and international investigation concluded, this was supported by all kinds of Western intelligence agencies - that the plane was shot down by pro-Russian separatists using a missile supplied by Moscow. Trump was asked about that. And he said, well, people say that. But you don't know. And there's other theories out there. Even the poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko, the Russian who drank polonium from a tea cup in London and died after that - he was a big Putin critic. Trump has been asked about that - same thing. We don't know. We don't know. He seems almost, you know, willfully blind to this pattern of Putin's actions in a way that doesn't add up. It makes you think that there's something going on that we don't completely understand. And that's really frustrating and, I think, for a lot of people, very troubling. GROSS: What kind of frustration does that pose for you as a journalist? CROWLEY: (Laughter) Well, I mean, on the positive side, it's an incredible story. And it makes me and a lot of other journalists want to keep digging. And we feel like we're chasing this incredible mystery that would - that could be, you know, a Titanic story if it turns out, as some people theorize, that Trump has some financial obligations that he hasn't disclosed. Remember, we haven't seen his tax returns. If he, in some way - if Putin has leverage on him that could be personal. Some people have raised the fact that Trump traveled to Moscow in 2013. And on that trip, he would have been, you know, surveilled by the Russians. They would've probably been trying to hack into all his communications. So some people say, do the Russians have something on him? This is all very speculative. The positive thing is it's an amazing and fascinating story. But it's incredibly frustrating to know how to deal with this. How do you talk about it? I mean, even now I'm dealing - sort of pushing the boundaries of speculation. With other presidents, you can go back and analyze their speeches and policy papers from their senior aides and kind of put it into theories of geopolitics. But none of that applies here. So we sort of lack a traditional framework. And so I find myself trying to turn to new ways of understanding this guy, which is both intellectually interesting and gratifying but also, so long as we're unable to answer the question, really frustrating. GROSS: Well, let's get to some of those new ways of trying to understand President-elect Trump. But first we have to take a short break. If you're just joining us, my guest is Michael Crowley. He's the chief foreign affairs correspondent for Politico. We'll be right back. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is Michael Crowley. He's the chief foreign affairs correspondent for Politico, and he's been writing a lot about Donald Trump and Russia. As you've said, because Donald Trump has revealed so little about his finances and because we have no record of past political positions in the sense that he's never had elected office before, you have to find new ways of trying to understand who he is, what his positions are, what his positions might be in the future. You've gone back and investigated some of his business deals. My understanding is that Donald Trump has been interested in having real estate deals in Russia, but hasn't had any real estate deals there. But he has had other things. One of the things we've heard him talk about with pride is the Miss Universe pageant, which was held in Russia in 2013. Does he still own the Miss Universe pageant? CROWLEY: He sold the Miss Universe pageant, I think, in 2014. But at the time he took it to Moscow, he was the owner and seemed quite delighted to be bringing it to Russia. GROSS: And I think he cited this as part of the foundation of how he knows so much about Russia. CROWLEY: Yeah, he did. I think it was during the primary campaign. And he had started talking a fair amount about Putin and Russia and he was asked what his basis for understanding Russia was and he cited this trip he took to Moscow for the Miss Universe pageant in 2013. And, you know, I thought that was amazing and I wanted to know more about this trip so I wrote a story where I dove in and learned everything I could about it. And it's still a little murky. I mean, we know that he took business meetings there. He seems to have been exploring real estate deals when he was there, but hasn't fully disclosed everyone he talked to everything, he was trying to do. My favorite part of this - and this goes back, Terry, to what I was saying a couple of minutes ago about the dark matter and the mysterious attraction to Putin - when he was headed over there, he started tweeting about Vladimir Putin and essentially inviting Putin to attend the pageant via Twitter. And in one kind of remarkable tweet that was almost written in the voice of, like, a teenage boy he said something to the effect of, you know, really excited for the Miss Universe pageant in Moscow tomorrow night or whenever it was. Do you think Vladimir Putin will come, and will he be my best friend? GROSS: (Laughter). CROWLEY: Which is just an incredible thing. And apparently - and I credit The Washington Post, which has done some good follow up reporting on this - apparently Trump thought Putin might actually attend. Putin did not attend, but he sent a gift, some kind of like an ornate jewelry box or something to that effect and a note. So Putin was aware that Trump was there and wanted him to come, but did not actually attend the pageant. GROSS: Well, you looked into how Trump decided to hold the 2013 Miss Universe pageant in Moscow and it was with the help of a billionaire Russian real estate mogul with ties to Vladimir Putin. And with this mogul's son, Emin - am I pronouncing his name right? CROWLEY: I think it's Emin. GROSS: Emin, OK. You describe him as a dance-pop singer with ambitions to international stardom. So what's the connection between this Russian real estate mogul, his would-be pop star son and Trump bringing Miss Universe to Moscow? CROWLEY: Well, this story was so much fun to explore. And I had no idea going in that this would be the case, but it seems that Trump wound up coming to Moscow because the son of this billionaire sort of real estate developer in Moscow had made a video for one of his pop songs featuring a former Miss Universe. And in the video he's chasing her through the streets at night and it's a kind of, you know, maudlin love song. And because of the Miss Universe connection, this pop singer is able to establish a line to Trump I think through the agent of the woman who had been in the video. And that starts a conversation that I guess revolves around Miss Universe and beautiful women and Moscow being a great place. And the path brings Trump to Moscow with his pageant. GROSS: Well, and the mogul who's the father of the pop star, he persuaded Trump not only to bring it to Moscow but to hold it. . . CROWLEY: Yes. GROSS: . . . In the concert hall that this billionaire Russian mogul owns (laughter). So there's definitely something in it for him. . . CROWLEY: Yes. GROSS: . . . To have Trump bring the pageant to Moscow. CROWLEY: Yes, absolutely. So they in effect do business together on the pageant. And I believe that they were discussing real estate projects in Moscow that went beyond the pageant, had nothing to do with the pageant, when Trump was there. And this is a guy who's, by the way, very powerful, has connections to the Kremlin, has gotten a lot of big contracts from the Kremlin. So he would be a good person to know. And kind of beautifully closing the loop on all this, Trump goes over there. They have the pageant. He hangs out with these guys. And the son, Emin, makes another music video in which it starts with him sitting in some kind of dull boardroom meeting and he dozes off. And the scene cuts and he wakes up in his apartment and he's in some dream fantasy. And all these Miss Universe contestants are sort of tromping around his apartment in bikinis and high heels while he's, like, sipping his coffee in his sweatpants. And so this goes on for a few minutes and then at the end of the video, he wakes up from his dream. He's back in the boardroom and, of course, it's Donald Trump sitting at the head of the table. And he's seen Emin doze off and he says, Emin, you're fired. Which of course is his signature line from \"The Apprentice. \" So everybody got something out of that trip, it seems. GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is Michael Crowley. He's the chief foreign affairs correspondent for Politico. We're going to take a short break and be right back. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is Michael Crowley. He's the chief foreign affairs correspondent for Politico. So there's a story I want you to tell that's also about Donald Trump's business connections to Russia. And this is actually a martial arts story because he teamed up with a business partner who was described as the king of mixed martial arts in Russia. And his name was - you say it. I'm - I think I'm going to get the pronunciation wrong on it. CROWLEY: Fedor (laughter). GROSS: OK. So who was Fedor, and how did he team up with Trump? CROWLEY: So Fedor - Emelianenko, I think, is his last name - was a major mixed martial arts figure in Russia. And he was a tough fighter. He was kind of the Mike Tyson of mixed martial arts. You know, would, you know, knock people out, you know, within a minute of the fight. Trump once said about Fedor, quote, \"his thing is inflicting death on people. \" And although I'm pretty sure Fedor never actually killed anyone, that was sort of his reputation. You know, if you fight Fedor, you're going to feel the pain. So Fedor also happened to be friends with Vladimir Putin, who frequently would sit in the front row at Fedor's fights and went on to appoint Fedor to a state sort of athletic body. All of which was very interesting when I discovered that Donald Trump also had a relationship with Fedor. And this was when Trump was enlisted by some kind of entrepreneurial guys in the world of mixed martial arts to back an MMA league that they were starting up to compete with the - sort of the established league, Ultimate Fighting Championship. So his big star with whom he appeared at press conferences - this was in 2008, just so people have a sense of the timeline. Well before he ran for president. His big star is a guy who is buddies with Putin and a big hero in Russia. And in addition to this, there is a plan which is described in a press release that was put out by this league, which I think was called Affliction Entertainment, which promises a reality show that will be based in St. Petersburg, Russia where up-and-comers get to compete for the chance to fight Fedor. Its going to be called \"Fighting Fedor. \" And Trump, I believe, was going to be the executive producer, and in the press release said that he would even be going to St. Petersburg for the show. So this league doesn't do very well. It's a fiasco. It seems never to have been very well organized or thought-out. They stage, I think, maybe three pay-per-view events and basically declare bankruptcy. And it ends in litigation, and everyone's mad at each other. But, Terry, it's just one more example of Trump having ties to business in a relationship with Russia that kind of makes you scratch your head. And I want to underscore again there's a lot that's great about Russia. And I think sometimes it is true that we get carried away in the U. S. with Russia phobia, which is not to say that Putin has not done a lot of really terrible things. But it's not that there's anything wrong with doing business in Russia. It's just - it's not clear what ties all this together. Why is Trump so interested in Russia? Why does Trump have this disproportionate amount of activity and interest in and affinity toward Russia? And the story of Fedor is one more mysterious data point. GROSS: So in both of the stories that you told, the one about the mixed martial arts and the other about the Miss Universe pageant, Donald Trump's main connections have been to billionaires in Russia. CROWLEY: Right. And Trump has other relations to very wealthy Russians. And I think this is important to include in our conversation, you know. Again, we don't know what his precise financial ties, dealings, obligations are because we haven't seen his tax returns. But there is a body of evidence to suggest that, you know, Russian money has played an important role in his real estate projects. So there are real estate deals he wanted to do in Russia that never got off the ground. But we've seen, for instance, his son saying that - a few years ago at a conference - that Russians make up a disproportionate or significant - I forget the precise word he used - amount of the money that they're making on their properties. And we also know that Trump once sold a mansion in Palm Beach for $100 million, which at the time was the highest sale price on a real estate deal, to a Russian oligarch. But he seems to know quite a lot of oligarchs. GROSS: So I want to change the subject here. One of the questions hanging over the election is the Russian hack of Democratic emails, of the DNC, of John Podesta. And the American intelligence agencies agree that those were Russian hacks. But one way or another, those documents that were published and written about in the press were the results of a criminal hack by a foreign country. So as a journalist covering foreign affairs, writing extensively about Trump and Russia, did you think through a lot whether it was appropriate to publish those documents and whether publishing those documents were, in some way, helping Russia do its work in, you know, messing around with our democracy? CROWLEY: I did think about this a lot, Terry. And I think that very serious and intelligent people can disagree. I did not write about the emails myself - I think with one exception relating to an email from the Obama-Bush transition in 2008 that had to do with the Bush administration's policy on Iraq, so kind of a long ago matter that didn't really have anything to do with the actors in the campaign. But people can make their own judgment about whether even that was appropriate to write about. But it's very hard for a news organization. It's - I guess it's a kind of a form of game theory. You know, if everybody's doing it and you're the only one not doing it, what are you accomplishing? I mean, do you - does it look like you're kind of taking yourself out of a conversation? Are you cutting off your ability to help people understand what's happening? Or do you stand on principle? And I guess, again, different people reach different conclusions. I myself wasn't enthusiastic about the coverage of the emails. And I think that it would be great - it's happening to some degree now - but I would love to see a more robust, deep, ongoing conversation about what to do when the next one of these things happens because it will. And I think that that conversation was not sufficiently had after the Sony email hack by the North Korean government. And, again, in that case, everyone just ran with the emails and, I think, didn't consider the implications of it. And you have to have that conversation before the next wave. And I'll just add, Terry, that, you know, one of (laughter) the most interesting and somewhat unsettling questions in play right now is, what else do they have? I don't think we can assume that everything the Russians got is out. And I don't think we can assume that if more stuff comes it's only going to involve Democrats. It's quite possible that there is material on Republicans and possibly even Trump himself which the Russians could use strategically, particularly if the relationship starts to hit a bad patch again. GROSS: You're talking about blackmail really, right? CROWLEY: Potentially. I mean, I can't say that I know that there is specific information that would be used that way. I can say that there is - I mean, any sane person who's following this can understand how easy it is to get material that's compromising, that embarrasses people. And when you talk to security experts and foreign policy experts, they all seem to think that the odds are very high that the Russians have a lot more stuff and that we don't know what it is. And that would fit a Russian pattern. They blackmail people all the time. They destroy opponents with embarrassing information or videotapes. They even plant false information. The word is kompromat. The New York Times did an excellent story a week or two ago about a - I believe he was, like, a Russian political dissident living outside of the country who had child pornography found on his computer by the authorities. And there seems to be compelling evidence that it was planted on him. So we need to have smart conversations now about how the press will deal with that stuff when it happens again. But I fear that the media ecosystem now is so atomized and so decentralized that even that conversation may not really provide thoughtful guidance as opposed to just a frenzy in the moment. GROSS: Well, Michael Crowley, I want to thank you so much for talking with us. CROWLEY: It's been a great pleasure. Thank you for having me.

That's about 200 people. His program, called Ease into Canada, helps refugees learn English, find housing and jobs. Some of the jobs are at Estill's own company, Danby, which manufactures small appliances. And he bought a dollar store franchise for one Syrian refugee to manage. We wanted to learn more about Jim's efforts to resettle refugees in Guelph, so we've reached him on the line. He joins us via Skype. Hi, there. JIM ESTILL: Hello. AUBREY: So why did you decide to take this project on of resettling all these families? Did you have a personal connection to Syria? ESTILL: No, I had no personal connection. But I'm a humanitarian. I could see what was happening. And it's - this is probably the biggest humanitarian crisis of my lifetime, and I didn't want to grow old and say I stood by and did nothing. So I decided to do my small part. AUBREY: Now, when a Syrian family arrives there, how do they find you? Or do you find them? ESTILL: Well, there's a lot of paperwork, and it takes six months to do security clearance. Then they finally arrive. And then when they arrive, we pick them up at the airport. And we usually billet them for two to six weeks with a family, and then we move them into their own apartment or townhouse. AUBREY: And once they move into a townhouse or apartment, then the work starts of finding a job, learning to speak English - these are huge undertakings, right? ESTILL: Exactly. I am a business person, so I organized it like a business. I have a director of jobs, director of housing, director of transportation, director of mentorship. And one of the most important things is the mentorships. So each family is assigned an Arabic-speaking mentor family and four or five English-speaking mentor families. Then we use checklists to make sure that they ride the bus with them to show them how to use the bus, get a library card, get their health card, set up a bank account. And so we're basically just trying to help people through a hard time. Success is 50 families settling, working, paying taxes, buying groceries where I buy groceries and speaking English with some degree of integration. I will have failed if I bring in people that end up on welfare, in my opinion. AUBREY: Tell us about some of the people you've helped so far. What are their stories? ESTILL: I brought in a family of seven, a mom and dad and their five children. The oldest son is 17 years old and had not been in school for five years. And his daughter had been 16 and not been in school for five years. And so when they came in, the son thought he should work and not go to school. But we convinced him. He went to school, and now he's loving it. So it's all good. AUBREY: Now I know that not everyone can think through, you know, sponsoring refugees. But here in the States, I know people who have helped, for instance, get an apartment set up for a family that's arriving. Are there little ways to help? ESTILL: Absolutely. And that depends on the family, but we have specific material needs. And we put the call out say - oh, we need new double-bed mattresses. Oh, we need new linens. We need towels - and people donate all of that. So donating and keeping those goods in circulation is a very positive thing to do. What people tend to do is say, oh, it's the spring. I'll get rid of my winter clothing. No, don't do that. AUBREY: People need it now. ESTILL: Exactly. Do it in the fall. So do it opposite. AUBREY: Are you going to see some of these people that you've helped settle over the holidays? Have you formed personal relationships, friendships with them? ESTILL: Oh, yes. I know all 47 families. So a typical evening for me is I often go have tea at one house and dinner at another house. And I'll stop in in the morning. And so I know most of them for sure. AUBREY: That's Canadian businessman Jim Estill. He joined me from Ottawa. Thank you so much. This has been really inspiring. ESTILL: Well, thank you. ALLISON AUBREY, HOST:  We go now to Guelph, Canada, in southwestern Ontario where, for the past year, Canadian businessman Jim Estill has made it his mission to help resettle 50 Syrian refugee families. That's about 200 people. His program, called Ease into Canada, helps refugees learn English, find housing and jobs. Some of the jobs are at Estill's own company, Danby, which manufactures small appliances. And he bought a dollar store franchise for one Syrian refugee to manage. We wanted to learn more about Jim's efforts to resettle refugees in Guelph, so we've reached him on the line. He joins us via Skype. Hi, there. JIM ESTILL: Hello. AUBREY: So why did you decide to take this project on of resettling all these families? Did you have a personal connection to Syria? ESTILL: No, I had no personal connection. But I'm a humanitarian. I could see what was happening. And it's - this is probably the biggest humanitarian crisis of my lifetime, and I didn't want to grow old and say I stood by and did nothing. So I decided to do my small part. AUBREY: Now, when a Syrian family arrives there, how do they find you? Or do you find them? ESTILL: Well, there's a lot of paperwork, and it takes six months to do security clearance. Then they finally arrive. And then when they arrive, we pick them up at the airport. And we usually billet them for two to six weeks with a family, and then we move them into their own apartment or townhouse. AUBREY: And once they move into a townhouse or apartment, then the work starts of finding a job, learning to speak English - these are huge undertakings, right? ESTILL: Exactly. I am a business person, so I organized it like a business. I have a director of jobs, director of housing, director of transportation, director of mentorship.

In just a few minutes, we'll talk about a U. S. -backed measure aimed at bringing peace to South Sudan that failed. But first, reaction continues to pour in after the Security Council passed a resolution condemning Israeli settlements. The U. S. abstained from the vote, even though it could have exercised its veto power, and that is a major break from traditional U. S. action. We wanted to know more about this so we're joined now by Ambassador Dennis Ross. He helped mediate the Israeli-Palestinian conflict during the Clinton administration. He's currently a distinguished fellow at The Washington Institute. That's a foundation looking at U. S. interests in the Middle East. He joins us via Skype from Tel Aviv. Ambassador Ross, thanks for joining us. DENNIS ROSS: Thank you. AUBREY: So first off today, the U. S. abstained from the vote that basically allowed this new resolution to pass that condemns Israeli settlements. What is the likely impact of this, or is it mainly symbolic? ROSS: Well, I suspect it's more symbolic than anything else. And the reason I say that is that it's hard for it to really constitute some kind of precedent. So if the next president is going to adopt a different posture, if this really isn't laying a predicate for sanctions, it's difficult to see how it really represents something that is substantive. I suspect it really is much more of a symbol than anything else. AUBREY: Now, there's been tension between the Obama administration and Prime Minister Netanyahu's government for, you know, some time now over the issue of settlements as well as the Iran nuclear deal. What is the response from Israel and from the Palestinians? ROSS: Well, you know, the response from the Israelis has been a very tough one. They see this as the U. S. not standing by Israel, not maintaining what has been a traditional posture. For the Palestinians who've been trying hard to internationalize the conflict, this is very much where they would like to see the focal point of activities. Even if it's symbolic, from their standpoint, it's a statement on the world stage. And for Palestinians, generally, the one place they feel they get a kind of broader understanding is on the world stage. AUBREY: It's interesting to note that there was applause in the chamber. Applause broke out following the vote, and the U. S. ambassador to the U. N. , Samantha Power, made the case that the vote was consistent with a bipartisan consensus that she said goes back to Ronald Reagan. What's the point she was trying to make here? What does she mean? ROSS: Well, I think what she was trying to say is that American policy on Israeli settlement activity has been consistent, at least in the sense that every administration has seen it as an obstacle to peace. The truth is every administration since Jimmy Carter's has viewed it as a political issue, not a legal issue. This was the first time that the Obama administration had actually allowed such a resolution to go through. AUBREY: You've already mentioned that President-elect Trump is not happy about the decision. He tweeted, things will be different after January 20. And Republican Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina is saying that the U. S. should pull funding from the U. N. What do you think we can expect going forward? ROSS: Well, I do think that the - in the near term, there's going to be a kind of reaction, or even a kind of backlash, along the lines that you saw, meaning that I think there'll be a real hesitancy to use the U. N. as a forum when it relates to the Israeli-Palestinian issue. We'll certainly see that in the early stages of the Trump administration. What we don't know is - is the Trump administration going to engage in any kind of consistent approach to Israeli-Palestinian diplomacy? AUBREY: All right, so something to keep watching.

MICHELE KELEMEN, BYLINE: The U. S. ambassador to the U. N. , Samantha Power, won a Pulitzer Prize for writing a book about genocide prevention. And as U. N. officials started sounding the alarms about South Sudan, she tried to persuade her fellow Security Council members to at least stem the flow of weapons to South Sudan and punish those responsible on both sides for stoking ethnic violence.

POWER: The council members who didn't support this resolution are taking a big gamble that South Sudan's leaders will not instigate a catastrophe. If those council members are wrong - and every report we have heard in this chamber suggests that they are - it is the people of South Sudan who will pay an unbearable price.

As NPR's Jane Arraf reports, Iraqi and U. S. commanders believe the fight is about to get even tougher.

UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: (Speaking Arabic). ABDUL WAHAB AL-SAADI: (Speaking Arabic). ARRAF: He's in a house he comes back to in a deserted village behind the front lines. His hand is bandaged. A few hours ago, he helped dig a family out of concrete rubble in east Mosul after a car bomb exploded. He shows me an ISIS mortar shell expertly made and branded with a black-and-white ISIS logo.

Their position near the front line makes us a little worried and delays us. ARRAF: There are more than 700,000 civilians trapped in Mosul. ISIS prevents them from leaving. And even if they could leave, Iraqi forces have cut off the exits to stop ISIS fighters from escaping. And ISIS has turned to new tactics suited to urban warfare.

That is exactly what Sheikh Omar Faye has done. He is Gambia's ambassador to the United States appointed by the same president he is now urging to step down. President Yahya Jammeh has ruled this West African country for more than two decades. He lost his re-election earlier this month and initially conceded but now refuses to give up power. Ambassador Sheikh Omar Faye is here in the studio. Welcome to the program. SHEIKH OMAR FAYE: Thank you for having me. I'm happy to be here. And yes, you're right. President Jammeh has ruled for a couple of decades and conceded the elections already when he said he lost, when he believed it was the will of the people. It was Allah's will, as he always calls it. A week later, he came and did a complete 360. SHAPIRO: You wrote an open letter in which you said Jammeh's refusal to leave has created a serious post-election crisis and put Gambia on a dangerous path. Why do you see this as dangerous? FAYE: Absolutely. If you follow the news right now, you realize that the ECOWAS. . . SHAPIRO: The ECOWAS - this is the West African States. FAYE: West African community are grouping big military forces. You know, call it the infantry, naval, the air force and everything. SHAPIRO: Threatening to send troops into your country. . . FAYE: Absolutely. SHAPIRO: . . . If the president does not step down. FAYE: Absolutely, to enforce the will of the Gambian people. SHAPIRO: Play this out for us. If in fact the president does not step down and West African troops do come into Gambia, what happens then? FAYE: In that case, it's going to bad for Gambia. It's bad for the (unintelligible) region, keeping in view that there is al-Qaida around the corner. There is all these terrorist groups hanging around there, just looking for cracks to get into places like small (ph) Gambia, and we don't want that to happen. So we believe that diplomacy will be given a chance. I strongly believe in diplomacy, and we are hopeful. SHAPIRO: Why do you think the president changed his mind? We are all familiar with rulers who refuse to accept the outcome of an election, but this president initially did accept the outcome. FAYE: I believe that he accepted that he was defeated. He said that this election is the most rigged-proof election around the world. We believe that there are a few people behind the scenes trying to push the president not to accept. This is my own I mean investigations and feedbacks I'm getting. I don't know the exact names of those behind, but we believe that there are a few people behind for their own selfish interests - want to put the Gambia in harm's way. SHAPIRO: You are one of maybe a dozen Gambian diplomats who are encouraging a peaceful transfer of power. Have you spoken to the current president personally? FAYE: I have spoken to some members of the coalition. I've even talked to some of the current government and including people here in the U. S. So yes, I have reached out to them to let them know that the Gambia is bigger than all of us. And I am part of the majority of Gambians who said that the president should give it up. And they want a change, and I'm with that majority of Gambians. SHAPIRO: You have been summoned back to Gambia. This is a government that has had a record of imprisoning and in some cases torturing some of its political opponents. What do you believe will happen if you do return? FAYE: I cannot tell you. I wish I knew. But I am a Gambian. I feel that I am a part of that country, and I want the rule of law and human rights to be respected. The Foreign Service regulation that I belong to allows me a minimum of 90 days to prepare myself, get my family together and get some logistics together. And that will give me time to weigh my options and depends on what happens on the ground and depends on who is doing what. Then that will determine whether I get to the Gambia. But yes, I cannot predict what's going to happen, but I don't want anybody to stop me from going to my beloved country, which is the Gambia. SHAPIRO: If President Jammeh remains in power and you return to Gambia, do you believe that your personal safety could be at risk? FAYE: Absolutely, absolutely. There is no questions about that because of the history and the reputation of the system. So yes, I think my safety will be at risk. There's no doubt about that. SHAPIRO: But then I have to ask. Given that this government does have a record of human rights abuses, why did you support the government for as long as you did? FAYE: I have done that because I've been serving my people. I was asked to go and serve the Gambia and not to serve an individual. SHAPIRO: Sheikh Omar Faye, Gambian ambassador to the United States, thank you for coming into the studio and speaking with us. FAYE: I appreciate it, my friend. Thanks for having us. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:  It's not often that an ambassador openly defies his country's leader. That is exactly what Sheikh Omar Faye has done. He is Gambia's ambassador to the United States appointed by the same president he is now urging to step down. President Yahya Jammeh has ruled this West African country for more than two decades. He lost his re-election earlier this month and initially conceded but now refuses to give up power. Ambassador Sheikh Omar Faye is here in the studio. Welcome to the program. SHEIKH OMAR FAYE: Thank you for having me. I'm happy to be here. And yes, you're right. President Jammeh has ruled for a couple of decades and conceded the elections already when he said he lost, when he believed it was the will of the people. It was Allah's will, as he always calls it. A week later, he came and did a complete 360. SHAPIRO: You wrote an open letter in which you said Jammeh's refusal to leave has created a serious post-election crisis and put Gambia on a dangerous path. Why do you see this as dangerous? FAYE: Absolutely. If you follow the news right now, you realize that the ECOWAS. . . SHAPIRO: The ECOWAS - this is the West African States. FAYE: West African community are grouping big military forces. You know, call it the infantry, naval, the air force and everything. SHAPIRO: Threatening to send troops into your country. . . FAYE: Absolutely. SHAPIRO: . . . If the president does not step down. FAYE: Absolutely, to enforce the will of the Gambian people. SHAPIRO: Play this out for us. If in fact the president does not step down and West African troops do come into Gambia, what happens then? FAYE: In that case, it's going to bad for Gambia. It's bad for the (unintelligible) region, keeping in view that there is al-Qaida around the corner. There is all these terrorist groups hanging around there, just looking for cracks to get into places like small (ph) Gambia, and we don't want that to happen. So we believe that diplomacy will be given a chance. I strongly believe in diplomacy, and we are hopeful. SHAPIRO: Why do you think the president changed his mind?

JOHN OTIS, BYLINE: In the mountains of western Colombia, Nasa Indian guards operate a roadblock. The guards are unarmed volunteers who question everyone who wants to enter their territory. The Nasa are nervous because several of their leaders have recently been shot dead. One of the guards, Jose Camayo, says he was attacked while riding home on his motorcycle. JOSE CAMAYO: (Foreign language spoken). OTIS: \"The bullets missed me, but they hit my briefcase and the seat of my motorcycle,\" he says. So far this year, more than 70 Indian leaders, human rights activists, social workers and leftist politicians have been killed. That's according to the Bogota think tank Ideas for Peace. Experts say many of these killings could be a byproduct of Colombia's new peace accord. It calls for the Marxist rebel group known as the FARC to get out of the illegal drug trade, disarm and form a political party. But now drug trafficking gangs are moving into regions like the Nasa reservation that lie near fields of marijuana, coca and opium poppies once controlled by the FARC rebels. CAMAYO: (Foreign language spoken). OTIS: Camayo says he and other Nasa guards have come under fire because the narcos view them as obstacles to doing business. But there could be something else going on. Some think right-wing factions are organizing armed gangs to sabotage the FARC's new political party and disrupt land reform and other policies mandated by the peace accords. GERARDO BARONA: (Foreign language spoken). OTIS: So says Gerardo Barona. He belongs to Marcha Patriotica, a left-wing group allied with the FARC. Dozens of Marcha Patriotica activists have been killed this year. BARONA: (Foreign language spoken). OTIS: Barona says, \"we have denounced these killings, but the authorities don't do anything. \" The violence calls to mind how right-wing interests opposed an earlier peace process. In the 1980s, death squads killed more than 2,000 members of a political party linked to the FARC. That helped derail peace talks back then.

One of the speakers, Manuel Rodriguez, says his 33-year-old son was shot dead last month. The murder has yet to be solved.

Boxing Day is always celebrated on December 26th, the day after Christmas. So what is it exactly? Well, in Britain, it's a bit like Black Friday. Government offices are closed. Stores are wide open. We called up Selfridges' department store in London and reached manager Luke Bayliss. He had to duck into a store room to escape the noise and crowds. LUKE BAYLISS: It's our first day of sales and mark downs. We had people queuing up - big groups of people have come in of up to 20, you know, (unintelligible). SHAPIRO: We asked Bayliss if he knew where Boxing Day came from. BAYLISS: I have no idea (laughter). SHAPIRO: So we had to go to other sources. We looked into it, and it turns out there are a few competing theories. Some historians say the name originates in Victorian times when churches passed around a donation box and asked congregants to open up their pocketbooks. Others say it's much older than that. Back in the 1500s, servants had to work on Christmas. The next day was theirs. Their employers would send them home with boxes of leftovers, gifts and holiday bonuses. And there's a third theory. Boxing Day is the day when blacksmiths and other tradespeople would receive boxes of money or gifts from their customers, a kind of end-of-the-year tip. Samuel Pepys, whose diary is considered an authoritative source on what life was like in England in the 17th century, he references the practice in a December 19, 1663 diary entry. KEVIN: (Reading) And thence by coach to my shoemaker's and paid all there and gave something to the boys' box against Christmas. SHAPIRO: Today, aside from shopping, Boxing Day is traditionally big for sports like soccer and fox hunting. TOM HUNT: Boxing Day has been for centuries the highlight of the calendar year for hunting. SHAPIRO: That's Tom Hunt of the Countryside Alliance, a group that supports fox hunting in the U. K. The practice is currently illegal if the fox is killed. HUNT: I think, actually, a lot of it's just got to do with the fact that, you know, everyone's been with their families on Christmas Day. Often, there's been a bit of excess in terms of eating and everything else, and I think, you know, a bit of hunting on Boxing Day is a fantastic way to get some countryside air.

I have - I said I have to stay open and to work with my staff and just - let's hope for better.

And while they're driving out ISIS, Iraqi and Kurdish soldiers are dying on the front. It's going to be a subdued New Years. You're more likely in this region to see a bottle of whiskey or vodka on the table than a round of cocktails, but Salar mixes one up. SALAR: I like blue margarita. That's one of my favorites.

Donald Trump promised to defeat that group many times throughout his campaign. Here's what he said back in September. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)DONALD TRUMP: So we're going to convene my top generals and give them a simple instruction. They will have 30 days to submit to the Oval Office a plan for soundly and quickly defeating ISIS. (CHEERING, APPLAUSE)TRUMP: We have no choice. SHAPIRO: Joining us now to look ahead to the next chapter in this conflict is NPR Pentagon correspondent Tom Bowman. Hey, Tom. TOM BOWMAN, BYLINE: Hey, Ari. SHAPIRO: So that was President-elect Trump of being optimistic. What do you think he'll do? BOWMAN: Well, of course, Ari, during the campaign, Trump complained that the Mosul operation in Iraq had bogged down. He complained that the generals running the war were incompetent. Now he owns it. So what can he do? People I talk with at the Pentagon say Trump could increase the number of airstrikes, but that could mean more civilian casualties. He could send even more American commandos and Green Berets or even conventional troops. But that of course could mean more American casualties. But the challenge all along has been this. The U. S. strategy is to rely on local forces to capture Mosul and Raqqah. That's the self-proclaimed ISIS capital in Syria. And it's been slow going either because local troops are not that competent, or they're not sufficient in number. Now, will Trump change that strategy in any way? That is the big question. SHAPIRO: The Mosul assault has been slow going. If we see an assault on rock in the New Year, do you expect it would look very different from what we've seen in Mosul? BOWMAN: Well, it is different. First of all, Raqqah is smaller. Mosul has some 2 million people. Raqqah has several hundred thousand, and there's no government troops in Syria to help like you have in Iraq. Iraqi government forces really make up the bulk of that fighting force. So. . . SHAPIRO: Is that because there is no Syrian government force or just because the U. S. won't work with them because they. . . BOWMAN: They won't work with them. SHAPIRO: . . . Are on opposite sides of the conflict? BOWMAN: Right, the Syrian government forces are busy taking out the moderate Arab rebels in the northwest part of the country. They're not really going after ISIS. So in Raqqah, you're relying on basically militias - Syrian Arab forces, Kurdish forces. And they don't have the firepower of the Iraqi forces. Now, the Pentagon has agreed to send in 200 more trainers to help beef up these forces in Syria. As it stands now, the U. S. has trained 3,000 Syrian Arabs, and officials say they'll need two or three times that number to take Raqqah. So they're a long ways off from actually entering the city. SHAPIRO: If we imagine that in 2017 ISIS is cleared from these two major cities, Mosul and Raqqah, in Iraq and Syria, would that mean the end of the conflict against ISIS? BOWMAN: Not necessarily. The sense is that ISIS will then become an insurgency much like we saw in Iraq after the fall of Saddam Hussein. And that problem went on for years, and it relied on a surge of U. S. troops. The other problem is that attacks on the West, both Europe and the U. S. , are being planned out of Raqqah, so it's possible that with Raqqah surrounded and eventually liberated, for example, you could see those attack plans unleashed. And you could also see some of these fighters slip back into Europe and plan future attacks. Obama himself has said even destroying the caliphate may not reduce the danger in the near term.

SHAPIRO: So that was President-elect Trump of being optimistic. What do you think he'll do? BOWMAN: Well, of course, Ari, during the campaign, Trump complained that the Mosul operation in Iraq had bogged down. He complained that the generals running the war were incompetent. Now he owns it. So what can he do? People I talk with at the Pentagon say Trump could increase the number of airstrikes, but that could mean more civilian casualties. He could send even more American commandos and Green Berets or even conventional troops. But that of course could mean more American casualties. But the challenge all along has been this. The U. S. strategy is to rely on local forces to capture Mosul and Raqqah. That's the self-proclaimed ISIS capital in Syria. And it's been slow going either because local troops are not that competent, or they're not sufficient in number. Now, will Trump change that strategy in any way? That is the big question. SHAPIRO: The Mosul assault has been slow going. If we see an assault on rock in the New Year, do you expect it would look very different from what we've seen in Mosul? BOWMAN: Well, it is different. First of all, Raqqah is smaller. Mosul has some 2 million people. Raqqah has several hundred thousand, and there's no government troops in Syria to help like you have in Iraq. Iraqi government forces really make up the bulk of that fighting force. So. . . SHAPIRO: Is that because there is no Syrian government force or just because the U. S. won't work with them because they. . . BOWMAN: They won't work with them. SHAPIRO: . . . Are on opposite sides of the conflict? BOWMAN: Right, the Syrian government forces are busy taking out the moderate Arab rebels in the northwest part of the country. They're not really going after ISIS. So in Raqqah, you're relying on basically militias - Syrian Arab forces, Kurdish forces. And they don't have the firepower of the Iraqi forces. Now, the Pentagon has agreed to send in 200 more trainers to help beef up these forces in Syria. As it stands now, the U. S. has trained 3,000 Syrian Arabs, and officials say they'll need two or three times that number to take Raqqah. So they're a long ways off from actually entering the city. SHAPIRO: If we imagine that in 2017 ISIS is cleared from these two major cities, Mosul and Raqqah, in Iraq and Syria, would that mean the end of the conflict against ISIS? BOWMAN: Not necessarily. The sense is that ISIS will then become an insurgency much like we saw in Iraq after the fall of Saddam Hussein. And that problem went on for years, and it relied on a surge of U. S. troops. The other problem is that attacks on the West, both Europe and the U. S. , are being planned out of Raqqah, so it's possible that with Raqqah surrounded and eventually liberated, for example, you could see those attack plans unleashed. And you could also see some of these fighters slip back into Europe and plan future attacks. Obama himself has said even destroying the caliphate may not reduce the danger in the near term. SHAPIRO: That's NPR Pentagon correspondent Tom Bowman. Thanks, Tom. BOWMAN: You're welcome.", "section": "World", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2016 NPR.  All rights reserved.

STEVE HALL: These recreational compounds were used sort of get away from the embassy, to get away from the pressures of working and living in very close proximity to everybody. You could get out and just sort of relax in the countryside. SIEGEL: Both compounds are luxury estates. The property in Maryland covers 45 acres on a peninsula just off Chesapeake Bay with a mansion and cottages alongside a pool and tennis courts. Steve Hall says there are two reasons why Obama would evict the Russians.

The second possible explanation is that it would simply be an irritant and would send a message to the Russians that, you know, we are displeased, and it would be sort of an annoyance. SHAPIRO: The administration offered no proof of any spying at these sites. And it's not just the Russians affected by their closing. In Maryland, the eviction will leave a void for nearby American resident Bonnie Delph. She's lived near the Russian estate for decades and remembers meeting the diplomats crabbing on the beach.

Unlike the ceasefire that broke down in September, the United States was not a party to bring about this agreement. Before Russia intervened heavily in the Syrian war, the Assad regime was on the ropes, and now it has retaken Aleppo. Well, does all that confirm Moscow's role as a regional power in the Middle East? Joining us via Skype is Steven Clemons. He's Washington editor at large for The Atlantic. And Steve Clemons, if this ceasefire holds up, does Vladimir Putin's stock in Russia and the Middle East go up? STEVEN CLEMONS: It surges. It goes to an extraordinary level because by playing all the pieces he's played in the region and taking very, very high risks, he will be the tycoon winner (laughter) in the Middle East sweepstakes right now. SIEGEL: When you say by taking risks, what risks did he take? CLEMONS: I think that when he began to invest more material weapons and people into the Syrian conflict, he took a major risk that this could both tarnish his own reputation if it failed but could also take him down a rabbit hole that looked a lot like Afghanistan. And a lot of us on the sidelines in America said what he was doing is exactly what Barack Obama didn't want to do for fear of falling down that slippery slope. So that was the big risk. He took it, and he took it in a way in which he looks as if he's the prevailing winner in the region right now orchestrating new deals with Turkey. Remember the Turks shot down a Russian aircraft, and so his diplomacy has been very deft. And he achieved his main goal, which was to keep Bashar al-Assad, his client state in power. SIEGEL: But even if the ceasefire holds in Syria and if peace talks proceed, Syria's going to be a country where many Sunni Arabs, the country's majority, have violently opposed the Assad regime, where ISIS still controls much territory, where Syrian Kurds want autonomy and where the regime survived only with military support from Russia, Iran and the Lebanese group Hezbollah. In that political mess, what do you think Russia really wants to see happen? CLEMONS: I think Russia wants to make sure that its primacy, its ability to be a definitive factor in what would unfold - the lines are going to be redrawn in the region. We don't know what Syria will look like in the future. It will continue to be a knot, as you just described, because of the factions that are going on there. But when it comes to the big powers there - so you've got in the region Iran, the Saudis and the Gulf states together, Turkey. And Russia itself now is demonstrating that it's not sort of sitting pathetically on the sideline, that it's a major player. So what it has achieved is a dominant place at the table in a period when many other nations - whether this is true or not remains to be seen, but look at the United States as in strategic contraction from the region, as unable to deliver for its allies during their dark days. SIEGEL: If we've been misunderstanding Putin, if we try to understand him, what is the Russian interest in the Middle East and the Mediterranean? How do you describe that? CLEMONS: I think it sees it as a demonstration project to show that Russia is not a basket case, that despite its economy contracting at the moment, that it has extraordinary power and ability to have leverage on global affairs. I think one of Russia's grievances has been after the fall of the Soviet Union, it went through a period, an era where it felt humiliated and discarded by much of the rest of the world. But right now, internationally, its muscle matters, and I think that's helping to buy time both for Putin but also the Russian psyche, if you will. This is not just Putin. Russians are very, very supportive of this more robust role that its country is playing. SIEGEL: Steve Clemons of The Atlantic, thanks for talking with us today. CLEMONS: Thank you, Robert.

There's a lot to think about, from the Syrian refugee crisis to the terrorist attacks in many parts of the world, to the shocking decision by the U. K. to leave the EU. I'm joined now by Abderrahim Foukara to talk more about this. He's the Washington, D. C. , bureau chief for Al Jazeera, and he was nice enough to join us in our Washington, D. C. , studios. Abderrahim, welcome back. Thank you so much for joining us, and Happy New Year to you. ABDERRAHIM FOUKARA: Same to you. Thank you. MARTIN: Now, as I - you know, there are as many lists as there are news organizations and journalists about the biggest stories of the year, so we want your perspective on the biggest international stories of the year. FOUKARA: Well, probably Syria is right up there, the fact that the Russians have helped the Syrian president re-establish control over Aleppo. And that's been bolstered by, you know, the ceasefire throughout Syrian territory except parts of Syria controlled by some groups considered by the Russians and others as terrorist groups. That's going to have implications for all the neighbors but particularly a neighbor like Turkey right across the border from Syria. MARTIN: We want to talk about Russia for a second - their role in the Syrian war. The country has been very much on the minds of Americans with the alleged hacking, the incoming president's seeming warmth toward Vladimir Putin. And now we have President Obama in the waning days of his presidency using his executive power to expel 35 Russian diplomats. Give us your take on this and how you see that - the U. S. and Russian relationship going forward. FOUKARA: Given, you know, the complexities of the world that both Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump will be operating in, it seems to me that that's going to be a short-lived honeymoon once Trump actually gets into office. When President Obama announced sanctions against Russia, we've already seen how Donald Trump has reacted to that, but especially we've seen how Vladimir Putin has reacted to it, saying, I'm not going to resort to tit for tat. I'm going to wait until Trump is in office. But the realities and the complexities of the world probably tell me that maybe in a year's time, we'll see Putin and Trump going in a different direction. MARTIN: Well, going forward, then, what are the big international stories that you will be keeping your eye on in 2017? FOUKARA: Definitely Syria - also the fight against the Islamic State in Iraq. When the battle to liberate Mosul started, there was some prediction that by the time Donald Trump or the next president - it was said at that time - takes over from Barack Obama, the fight will be mostly over. We have found out that the battle to liberate Mosul is proving much more complicated than originally predicted. So Iraq is going to stay right up there in terms of the order of priorities. I also see the relationship between the Israelis and the Palestinians and how it impacts major powers such as the United States. I also see that as coming back to some sort of attention, particularly in the wake of the resolution against Israeli settlement in the Palestinian territories at the United Nations Security Council. So you know, these are probably some of the big stories that especially we as journalists are going to have to keep an eye on and will be covering. MARTIN: That's Abderrahim Foukara.
