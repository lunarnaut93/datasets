We remember that      clear September morning so well:  two planes, confusion, chaos, collapse,      death, thousands of victims. After the towers fell, nearly 20,000      fragments, pieces of human bodies, were collected from the World Trade      Center sites and later from the Fresh Kills landfill in Staten Island,      New York.  The massive job of trying to match those pieces to a face, to      a mother, a sister, a husband, a friend, fell into the hands of my next      guest.      Normally he's used to dealing with carefully collected DNA evidence from      crimes on the scene, from rapes, from homicides.  Nothing prepared him      for the work such as a mass tragedy that was presented to him.  He's      author of a new book, \"Who They Were:  Inside the World Trade Center DNA      Story; The Unprecedented Effort to Identify the Missing. \"  Robert Shaler      is the former director of the forensic biology department in the office      of the chief medical examiner of New York, and he has now--joining us      from WPSU, a member station, because he is now a professor of      biochemistry and molecular biology at Penn State University.      Welcome to the program.      Dr. ROBERT SHALER (Penn State University; Author, \"Who They Were\"):      Thank you.  It's--glad to be here.      FLATOW:  This--you know, reading this book, there's--it's almost      cathartic for you, is it not?  It's a very emotional book.      Dr. SHALER:  Yeah, I think it was.  It was one of the--when I finally      made the decision to write the book, I found that it was something that I      just couldn't stop doing.  I had to get it finished in order to feel      better for myself.      FLATOW:  Tell us what you were doing that day.      Dr. SHALER:  I was at a staff meeting, and one of the staff members in my      lab came and knocked on the door and said a small plane has hit the World      Trade Center, and they want to set up a temporary morgue in Lower      Manhattan, and would it be all right if I go along with them?  And I      said, `Sure. '  And I followed him downstairs, and by the time we got      downstairs, we knew that there was at least one major--one airliner had      hit one of the buildings and the medical examiner's office was mobilizing      to go downtown to Midtown--to Lower Manhattan to set up a temporary      morgue.  We knew that there was a fire, and where there's a fire, there's      usually bodies, and so that was our job is to collect the bodies and      identify them.      FLATOW:  Hey, you write that you were, you know, set up to handle maybe      an airplane crash of a few hundred people as you might have to, you know,      if there were a plane crash in New York at one of the major airports, but      nothing on this scale.      Dr. SHALER:  Well, that's true.  You know, I was in charge of the largest      public forensic biology laboratory in the United States at that time, and      we had certain capacity, more so than most laboratories in the country.      And we felt fairly confident that we could handle an airplane crash of a      couple of hundred people.  And in fact, we did; we had the American      Airlines Flight 587 crash two months after the World Trade Center      buildings fell.  But when you're looking at 19,000-plus pieces and 2,749      people that die and everyone is fragmented, you--it's such an      overwhelming task, you can't do it all by yourself.      FLATOW:  So what did you have to do to get this work?  Did you have to      totally revamp the way you normally do work and collect the data?      Dr. SHALER:  Well, yeah.  The--we had to completely reorganize the      laboratory. The laboratory had to be divided into what we call disaster      teams, and we had to continue working rapes and homicides in the city of      New York, 'cause that's our primary mission.  And then, of course, the      World Trade Center gave us a secondary mission.  But we still had to      enlist other laboratories to help us, and at one time we had six      different laboratories around the country working with us.      FLATOW:  At what point did you realize that the old way of doing things      wasn't going to work; you'd have to just change everything?      Dr. SHALER:  Well, about the third week. . .      FLATOW:  Was it moments, hours, days, months?      Dr. SHALER:  Well, you know, it's one of these things where you have this      enormous task. . .      FLATOW:  Yeah.      Dr. SHALER:  . . . and you know it's a big task, but you just start doing      the things that you normally do to put processes in place.  And then you      get to the point and you think, you know, `I need help. '  And that      happened probably in the first part of that first week.  Tuesday was when      it happened, and by Friday we were talking to the state police about      having them help us.      FLATOW:  And how do you deal with the 20,000 pieces that need      identification?      Dr. SHALER:  Well, I don't know if how you deal with them is the way to      look at it.  If somebody gave me a stack of 20,000 pieces, I'd say, `It      can't be done. '  But what happens is they come in piecemeal.  You know,      you--came in, like, several hundred a day or a couple thousand a week.      It's not like you get all 20,000 at one time.  And the collection process      or the recovery process, as we call it, went on until May of the next      year, so it was a nine-month period where these pieces are coming in the      laboratory.      And so you set up processes to analyze them.  The first thing you do is      you have to categorize them, and you have to--you do that using bar codes      so that you don't mix something up.  And then you have to extract the      DNA, and once you extract the DNA then you have to analyze it, and then      once you analyze it you have to interpret it, and then once you interpret      it you have to see if it matches anybody.  So it's a very--it's a      stepwise process.  All the steps weren't in place when it started, and we      had to build a number of those processes from scratch in order to get it      all done.      FLATOW:  So the FBI coding system that you used just wasn't going to      work.      Dr. SHALER:  Well, that's true, and the reason for that is that the FBI's      system is built upon being able to obtain high-quality DNA.  And the FBI      coding system is called CODIS, which is like a national DNA index that we      commonly use or routinely use to identify rapists and murderers who've      been arrested in the past, and then we can compare their DNA against DNA      found at the crime scene, for example.  And that's a direct match, and      it's a very fairly simple and easy thing to do, and most of the DNA you      get is in good enough condition that you have almost full or complete DNA      profiles.      FLATOW:  Hang on to that. . .      Dr. SHALER:  The World Trade Center. . .      FLATOW:  Hang on, 'cause we're--I don't want to interrupt your flow, but      I wanted to give you more time to give us the full story.  So stay with      us; we'll be right back after this short break.      I'm Ira Flatow.  This is TALK OF THE NATION/SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.      (Soundbite of music)      FLATOW:  You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION/SCIENCE FRIDAY.  I'm Ira      Flatow.      We're talking with my guest, Robert Shaler, who is former director of the      forensic biology department of the office of the chief medical examiner      of New York, and who's the gentleman who was in charge of, you know, the      DNA, identifying the 20,000 different forensic pieces of DNA that needed      to be identified, parts of people from the World Trade Center; author of      the new book \"Who They Were:  Inside the World Trade Center DNA Story;      The Unprecedented Effort to Identify the Missing. \"  Our number:  1 (800)      989-8255; 1 (800) 989-TALK.      Dr. Shaler, when I rudely interrupted you, you were telling us about the      limitations of the identification system that you were using at--the FBI      system; is that correct?      Dr. SHALER:  Well, most public forensic DNA laboratories utilize the      FBI's CODIS system, which is the national DNA index, and we use this to      identify rapists and murderers by matching crime-scene samples to DNA      taken from these people when they're arrested and incarcerated.      But the World Trade Center was different because the DNA was not very      good quality DNA and, in fact, it was what we call part--we got partial      DNA profiles.  And no one had ever done much work before to utilize      partial DNA profiles to make identifications, so we had to put a whole      series of new things, processes, into place in order to make      identifications.  And in order to do this, we convened a panel of about      30 scientists who sit down and discuss these issues.  These are people      who are geneticists, people who have had mass disaster experience,      although none of them had experience with something like this before.      And we put in rules to enable us to make these identifications so that we      were certain that we were not making mistakes.      FLATOW:  You write in your book that--and I'll quote from it--\"I decided      early in October 2001 to venture away from the tried and true\"--and you      say--use a term STRs--\"used daily in forensic work worldwide, because I      knew in my heart that path would not return enough of the missing to      their families. Unfortunately, the path I chose left my staff emotionally      drained and created problems for my laboratory's daily routines.  My      decision dragged out the testing by at least two years, probably longer,      and it almost killed me. While I'm sorry for the extra work and intense      emotional pressure I heaped upon my staff, I will never apologize for      bringing loved ones back to their families, loved ones who, without these      new technologies, would forever remain nameless. \"      Can you explain what that means, what you did and how--the new territory      you had to blaze there to make this work, and why it was such an      exhausting situation for you?      Dr. SHALER:  Well, the first thing I noticed was that, like I said, we      were having partial DNA profiles.  And the amount of DNA in the DNA      information we were getting was so skimpy that we'd never be able to make      identifications. So we had to--I had to look at other ways of analyzing      DNA.  The fact that there was DNA there gave me hope that maybe we could      do something about it.      So we looked at a couple of different things.  One, we looked at what we      call miniplexes, and these are different ways of looking at STRs, but in      such a way that we can look at smaller pieces of DNA than we had been      looking at in the past.  And so by looking at smaller pieces of      DNA--because what happens when DNA deteriorates, it fragments into      smaller and smaller pieces.  So I reasoned that if we could look at some      of those smaller pieces, we might be able to make more identifications.      So what happened--we had to have the laboratory reinvent a wheel, so to      speak. They had to go back and do research to make sure that these      techniques worked, and then we had to put them through an exhaustive      proficiency testing program. We had to make sure that what they were--the      results they were getting were valid on the kinds of samples that we had      in the laboratory.  So this took a year to get this work done.  So it      extended the process because we had to research it to make sure it was      working properly.      But on the day that we finally--we started that process in March 2002,      and in December 2002 we got our first day--actually, we started that      process in November 2001.  And by December 2002, on the first day we got      data, we got five new identifications.  And for all of us in the      laboratory at the medical examiner's office, it was, you know, high fives      and we were hugging each other because we just--we had been getting very,      very few identifications, and to get five new ones at exactly that--from      this new data, it was just a terrific feeling.      So that was one of the new things we did.  Another thing we did was to      look at even smaller pieces of DNA, and we used--identified mutations on      the DNA called SNPs, which stands for single nucleotide polymorphisms.      And although SNPs have been around for a long time and people know about      them and the pharmaceutical industry is using them, they'd never been      used for this kind of a purpose before.  They'd never been used to make      identifications in a mass disaster where the quality of the DNA is really      bad.      And so it wasn't until late in 2004 when we started getting all of the      data from the SNPs, and finally when we got that data, we were able to      make new identifications from that as well.  And what really happened as      far as new identifications was concerned is we were able to take these      new technologies and marry them to the tried-and-true technology.  So we      get a piece of the data from the original STR testing, we get another      piece of data from the miniplex testing, and then we get another piece of      data from SNP testing.  And we could make an identification that way.      Otherwise, without any of those technol--with the original technology, we      would never make the identification.      FLATOW:  But you would have to have something to compare it to, right, an      original?      Dr. SHALER:  That's exactly right, and there's two ways to do that.  One      is what we call direct testing, where you take a sample from the person      who's missing, which could be from a toothbrush; it could be a biopsy; it      could be biological fluid from a pair of underwear--and you take that DNA      and you get a DNA profile from it and you put that into a database.  And      then you take a DNA profile from a piece of tissue from a mass disaster,      and you put that into a database, and hopefully you have the appropriate      kind of software that can help you match those samples up.  So that's      called a direct test.      There's also an indirect test, which is much like a paternity test.  So      you get biological samples from the biological relatives of the person      who's missing, which could be a mother and a father, it could be brothers      and sisters or it could be combinations.  And what you're doing is you're      creating the genetic profile of that family.  And so when you get the DNA      profile of the fragment from the mass disaster site, you see if that      genetic profile fits into the genetic structure of the family.  And if it      does, then you have an identification.      FLATOW:  How did you go about collecting these samples from the families      or getting any of the originals to compare to?      Dr. SHALER:  Well, New York City set up family assistance centers, and      these were set up in various places around the city, but the one that was      there the longest was on Pier 94 on the--along the Hudson River.  And      families would come and they would be interviewed and they would give      samples.  We had provided police department with sort of like a road map      on the kinds of samples you could collect.  The problem is that the      police who were collecting the samples didn't understand DNA testing;      they don't understand identification using DNA.  They're not the. . .      FLATOW:  In fact, that was not really their job to do that in a normal      situation, right?      Dr. SHALER:  Oh, normally they don't do things like that, that's correct.      FLATOW:  Yeah.  You had to train them how to do that as sort of      on-the-job training.      Dr. SHALER:  Yeah, they had to be trained.  There wasn't enough time to      train them.      FLATOW:  Yeah.      Dr. SHALER:  The family assistance center, I believe, was set up--the      first one was set up on Thursday. . .      FLATOW:  Right.      Dr. SHALER:  . . . which would be the 13th of September.  And they weren't      prepared to do it, and so a lot of mistakes were made.  And samples were      collected inappropriately; they were labeled improperly.  And this      created a huge nightmare for us because we had to go back and sort out      these problems because if you don't, then you put the wrong name to a      piece you get from the mass disaster site, and you end up giving samples      back to a family that shouldn't have it.      FLATOW:  1 (800) 989-8255 is our number, 1 (800) 989-TALK.      Have all the samples been identified now?      Dr. SHALER:  No.  There are significant--there's about 1,100-plus samples      which have not been identified.  Some of these have very poor DNA quality      in them.  Some of them have absolutely no DNA left in them.  So the ones      with no DNA will never, ever be identified.  And these are typically the      samples that came from the hottest parts of the burning buildings.  These      are bones which are pure white; they have no biological material left in      them.  We call these kinds of bones creamains, very much like a cremated      sample.      FLATOW:  Were there any lessons from your experience with forensics and      the World Trade Center that might have or were possibly used in      identifying body with the Katrina victims?      Dr. SHALER:  Well, yeah.  They--every step in the identification process      created a lesson for us, and--because there were mistakes made all along      the way, and mistakes in that we just didn't have the processing set up      and we had to learn how to do them.  And what we learned is that people      tend to make the same mistakes over and over again, and when they began      getting in to make the identifications at Katrina, I was working with      some folks in Louisiana, trying to help them from making the same      mistakes that we did.  And by and large, they did correct some of those      mistakes, but then they had another set of problems that they had to work      with, and the problems that they had were different from the problems we      had in New York.      FLATOW:  You eventually had to give up--I don't mean give up the project,      but you had to stop trying to identify samples.  Why was that?      Dr. SHALER:  We ran out of technology.  We had taken the technology that      we were using as far as it could go, and we weren't getting any new      identifications out using it.  So it's time to what we call a pause and      back off for a while with the intent of, when new technology comes along,      we would pick up the project again.      FLATOW:  Were the families of the victims cooperative, or did they see      this as an intrusion?      Dr. SHALER:  They were the most terrific people I'd ever met in my life.      They helped us; they were supportive of us.  All they ever demanded from      us was to tell them the truth and not to pull punches on them.  You know,      they would come through the laboratory and we would explain the process      and what the DNA process was and what kind of data we were collecting and      how we interpreted it.      It was really important to them that we demystify the DNA process.  You      can just imagine, you get a piece of bone back which is maybe six inches      long, and that's the only piece you get back.  And they ask, `Well, how      did you make the identification? '  And you say, `Well, DNA made the      identification. '  Well, to a layperson, what does that mean?  They have      to have incredible faith that you as a scientists, that you as a      government worker are doing the kind of job and the quality job to now      enable you to make that kind of a decision and say that this piece of      bone came from your loved one.      And as most people are a little skeptical of government in general, you      have to do more than just say that to them; you have to show them and you      have to show them the controls you've put into place.  And this is      exactly what we did.  We had weekly meetings with these families.  We      talked to them.  Our lines were open to them.      FLATOW:  Yeah.      Dr. SHALER:  And on top of that, I think they felt a compassion that we      had for their loved ones.  And when I'd make an identification or my      other staff would make--others on my staff would make identifications, we      saw the pictures of these missing people on our computer screens, so we      could put a face to a name.  And I think the ones who saw that really      appreciated the fact that we did that.      FLATOW:  Were there people who just didn't want to know, don't--you      know. . .      Dr. SHALER:  Yes.      FLATOW:  Yeah, `I just can't deal with it. '      Dr. SHALER:  Yes.  There were a couple hundred families who just said,      `Look, we're not going to give you any way to make this identification.      We're not going to give you biological samples.  We're not going to give      you toothbrushes.  We believe that our loved one died down there, and      we'll'--I guess they had to go prove it to the courts so that they could      settle their estates, but they just didn't want the remains back.      FLATOW:  And what has all this done to you?      Dr. SHALER:  Well, it's given me a different perspective on life and      given me another cause in life, so to speak, and that cause has to come      through the education process.  One of the things I learned in going      through this is that the young people in this country are not prepared to      do this.  And I just thought that by coming to Penn State and starting a      new forensic science program that I could be instrumental in helping      young people get to the point where they could handle something like this      because part of our program is to talk to them about handling mass      disasters.      FLATOW:  Mm-hmm.  We're talking about forensics this hour on TALK OF THE      NATION/SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.      Talking with Richard Shaler, who is author of the new book \"Who They      Were: Inside the World Trade Center DNA Story:  The Unprecedented Effort      to Identify the Missing. \"  You were just telling us that--about the      center.  You are professor of biochemistry and molecular biology at Penn      State but you're now the director of the forensics program.  Is this      something for incoming freshmen, for everybody, or is it somebody who      wants to go into forensics?      Dr. SHALER:  Well, it's for both.  It's for forensic--for students who      are coming into the college as freshmen and they want to go into forensic      science. We've established a four-year baccalaureate program, which I      think is probably the most rigorous program in the country.  When I was a      director of the laboratory in New York City I invariably saw students who      walked through the doors looking for jobs who had even master's degrees,      didn't even know how to make up solutions, didn't know how to use a      pipette.  And I thought that was really bad.  How could anyone in a      position like I had hire someone who really didn't understand the very      basics of science?      FLATOW:  Mm-hmm.      Dr. SHALER:  So the program that I wanted when I came to Penn State was      to create a program that created first scientists and then forensic      scientists. And that's--and we've put together an extremely rigorous      program so that when these students leave Penn State, they're going to be      the best-trained and the best students to go into the profession.      Now we've also created a master's program and we're going to build upon      our baccalaureate program.  It is the most rigorous master's program I      know of in the country.  And our goal is to create quality scientists and      quality forensic scientists.  And one of the things we're doing with      these students is teaching them from the mistakes that others have made.      You know, if someone has made a mistake, these things get publicized in      the newspapers and you can go and get the information and you can find      out why the mistake was made.  And these become great teaching lessons      for students.  So that once they understand the underpinnings of the      profession, which is basic science, then they can go off and they      can--they'll be able to handle the rigors of the real world when they get      out.      FLATOW:  Have these forensic TV shows been a boon or a bane to you, do      you think?      Dr. SHALER:  Both.  They certainly create students who have an interest      in forensic science.      FLATOW:  I'll bet, yeah.      Dr. SHALER:  Yeah.  We have a freshman class of about 20 people, and, by      and large, most of them are there because of \"C. S. I. \"  And that's good      because it creates an interest in the profession.  But it also creates      unrealistic expectations on the parts of some of these students.  They      don't understand when they do this that they're not--that they're coming      to school to be scientists.  They think that they're going to be doing      crime scene investigations and a little bit of science along with it.      FLATOW:  Shine a light on it and you get the answer, yeah.      Dr. SHALER:  Well, that's true.  And, you know, that's what you see on      \"C. S. I. \"      FLATOW:  Right.      Dr. SHALER:  Now \"C. S. I. \" has done a good thing.  It has created a person      who doesn't really exist but maybe that person should exist.  So we're      trying to create that person in a world where that person doesn't exist.      FLATOW:  Mm-hmm.  But first you have to break them of the old idea, the      old stereotype.      Dr. SHALER:  Yeah, and what's going to happen, I think, is these students      who come in the door and into our program and some of them are going to      realize that they're not cut out to be scientists.  But that doesn't mean      they can't go into law enforcement and that doesn't mean we can't teach      them the principles of crime scene investigation and crime scene      reconstruction.  We can certainly do that and we will and we are.  But I      don't think they're going to graduate with degrees in science.  They may      end up in crime law and justice or something like that. . .      FLATOW:  Mm-hmm.      Dr. SHALER:  . . . but they'll still be productive members of the law      enforcement community.      FLATOW:  Yup.  We're talking with Robert Shaler, former director of the      Forensic Biology Department of the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner      in New York.  He is now talking about his new course at Penn State      University.  He is author of \"Who They Were:  Inside the World Trade      Center DNA Story:  The Unprecedented Effort to Identify the Missing. \"      I know you're all on the line waiting to talk to him.  We'll take a short      break, go to the phones, take your calls, talk about the investigations,      the forensics that are involved in the World Trade Center.  So stay with      us. We'll be right back after this break.      I'm Ira Flatow.  This is TALK OF THE NATION/SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.      (Announcements)      FLATOW:  You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION/SCIENCE FRIDAY.  I'm Ira      Flatow.      We're talking this hour about using DNA to identify victims in the World      Trade Center and 9/11 attacks with my guest Robert Shaler, former      director of the Forensic Biology Department in the Office of the Chief      Medical Examiner of New York.  He's author of \"Who They Were:  Inside the      World Trade Center DNA Story:  The Unprecedented Effort to Identify the      Missing. \"      Our number, 1 (800) 989-8255.  Let's go to the phones to Michael in Grand      Rapids.  Hi, Michael.      MICHAEL (Caller):  Hi, Ira, great show.      FLATOW:  Thank you.  Go ahead.      MICHAEL:  I've got two little questions.  One, I was wondering if there      was any DNA collected from service animals or people's personal pets that      might have been in the building and if that impacted the process?  And      did they identify and collect DNA from all of the people that were in the      aircraft that hit the buildings?      FLATOW:  You mean the terrorists?      MICHAEL:  I'll take my answers off the air.      FLATOW:  OK.  I think he meant the terrorists.  Did you collect any      terrorist DNA?  Could you identify them?      Dr. SHALER:  We identified three of the terrorists.  I was surprised      because I didn't think any of the--anyone from the planes would be      identified because just the way the planes hit and then exploded.  But      apparently--rumor was that passengers were herded to the back of the      plane and guarded there so that when the planes hit the buildings and      exploded it apparently blew--fragmented them but also blew them out of      the main fireball.  And so we were able to identify some of them.  And      when we started seeing identifications of people on the planes coming      through, we though maybe we would be able to identify some of the      terrorists, as well.  So we contacted the FBI to see if the FBI      would--had any information or any DNA from the terrorists or had access      to it.  And it took us about a year to get that all together.  We finally      got a letter from the FBI that gave us 10 DNA profiles that were coded.      We didn't have names associated with them, but presumably from the      terrorists, and we made a couple of identifications immediately.  And      then a third one came at a later time.      FLATOW:  You say in your book that--you describe working with the FBI as      `an exasperating experience. '      Dr. SHALER:  Yeah, well they--you know, the FBI is--has its own way of      doing things and I guess getting approvals through the system is tedious      and tough. And it's hard to work with them because they aren't always      very cooperative. There's always something going on that--I don't know      what it--it's hard to say what it is, but just getting them to work with      you and cooperate is tough. You know, when this first happened they came      right away and they wanted to help us set up this DNA network so that we      could make identifications, but the system that had been set up was not      geared toward making identifications in a mass disaster.  It's geared      toward identifying people who are in jail and who have left samples at      crime scenes.  So it doesn't--it didn't do the kinds of things that I      wanted to have done and--or needed to have done.  And so we had a meeting      and we talked about these things and the best ways to get it done. And      the FBI had their way--what they thought was the way to do it and we      had--we learned that really wasn't the best way to go about it.  And we      found that to be true.      Getting the terrorists' DNA was another issue.  It just took like a year      to get it done and I could never understand why.  Maybe they had to go      out and go to the places where these people lived and actually collect      samples and that took time.  But I just don't know what took so long.      FLATOW:  Mm-hmm.  1 (800) 989-8255 is our number.  What kind of samples      did you have to work with?  Were there a lot of tiny fragments?  Were      they big body parts?  What were the majority of them?      Dr. SHALER:  Well, they were both.  We had, I think, 200 and some fairly      intact bodies.  These were torsos, top and bottom torsos, arms.  We had      arms, we had legs, we had feet, we had hands, we had heads.  But the vast      majority of the pieces were very small, like an inch of a bone or just      some tissue, things like that.      FLATOW:  You said that when you worked with bones even you, the grizzled      forensic expert, had trouble with that.      Dr. SHALER:  Yeah.  You know, when you work in the forensic world you see      some pretty strange things.  And, you know, you get used to this.  You      get used to dead bodies.  You get used to being in an autopsy room      watching autopsies.  I don't think I'd ever want to do an autopsy, but      you still get used to seeing it.  And you go to crime scenes and you see      bodies.  And you're used to smelling things that smell pretty bad      sometimes.  But it's isolated. It doesn't happen every day.  But when you      see this--it's like an endless stream of human destruction coming through      the door and mounds of it and just piece after piece after piece of this,      it wears you down.      FLATOW:  1 (800) 989-8255.  Let's go to Susan in San Francisco.  Hi,      Susan.      SUSAN (Caller):  Hello.  Hello?      FLATOW:  Yes, go ahead.      SUSAN:  Hi.  I was one of the attorneys who worked for the city      attorney's office and was at the Family Assistance Center on Pier 94.      And I just wanted to say thank you for the work you did.  It was an      overwhelming experience.  As you just said, it--the day after day was      extremely draining but I also found it a tremendous opportunity to help      other people in one of the most vulnerable positions anyone could be.      There was a great compassion.  I agree there was a great compassion to      the work.  There was a great sensitivity.  Even the way this pier was      transformed into a family assistance center, that the curtains--curtains      created little rooms and police worked quietly in a little curtained      room.  And we attorneys interviewed families in our little areas.      The role of the attorneys--the Chief Medical Examiners Office I guess was      technically our client--we were interviewing the families, helping them      establish through sworn testimony that the loved one was missing and      there was no body, had, in fact, died at the World Trade Center.  So we      were the ones who were helping them track down, apart from the DNA      evidence, enough information for the family to go to court without a body      and demon--prove to the court there was a--their loved one had died so      they could go through the other necessary paperwork.  It was--I mean,      just listening to you speak, has brought a lot of tears and, again, I      just wanted to say thank you.  It was a wonderful opportunity and there      was a lot of compassion, a lot of hard, hard dedication that went on for      months and months and months to do as complete a job as possible for all      those people.      FLATOW:  Thank you for calling.      Dr. SHALER:  Thank you.      SUSAN:  Sure.  Thank you, bye-bye.      FLATOW:  Lot of compassion in that book.      Dr. SHALER:  Well, I think that's what it was about.  I think one of the      things that we tend to forget when mass disasters or mass fatality events      take place is that they're really all about people.  Even Katrina is the      same thing.  We try to rescue the living first and then we try to recover      the bodies so that we can return them to their families.  You know,      there's always going to be an economic loss because buildings are going      to be damaged and the possessions of people are going to be lost.  But      when you come right down to it, it's about people and it's about      families.      FLATOW:  Mm-hmm.  1 (800) 989-8255.  Jenn in Chattanooga.  Hi, Jenn.      JENN (Caller):  Hi, how are you?      FLATOW:  Hi, go ahead.      JENN:  I saw a program over the Christmas holiday about two women, one on      the West Coast, one on the East Coast, who had some DNA testing, one for      a transplant and one to determine paternity.  And they both had really      unique cases where they didn't match the DNA of their children.  And they      did a lot of investigation and determined that they actually had two      separate strands of DNA within one person.  And they had to look really      hard to find in certain organs or certain body systems the DNA that      didn't match and then to find the DNA that did match their family's.  And      I'm wondering if that's just sort of an emerging part of DNA science and      whether anything--when you're trying to determine identity, if that's      ever brought into consideration?      Dr. SHALER:  You know, this is such a rare event that it certainly is      puzzling when it happens, and, certainly, biologically, it's possible.      And I'm--I know of those two cases you're talking about and they      certainly created a lot of problems for those families and for the      scientists involved because it becomes a real puzzle that has to be put      back together.  But there is a good scientific explanation for it and the      reason for that mosaic problem that occurs; it's well-known.  It's just      extremely rare.      FLATOW:  1 (800) 989-8255.  Mary in Madison, Wisconsin.  Hi, Mary.      MARY (Caller):  Hi, how are you?      FLATOW:  Fine, how are you?      MARY:  Good.  I was just calling to thank the gentleman that you're      speaking with today and to extend my thanks to all of his staff.  I lost      my brother on 9/11.  I personally spent a fair amount of time in the      Medical Examiner's Office of New York, both immediately after 9/11 and      then some months and years after as they went through the process of      identification, and they were able to identify my brother's remains, and      we were able to bring them home.  And I just wanted to call and say thank      you.      Dr. SHALER:  I'm glad we did that.      FLATOW:  Thank you for calling.      MARY:  Thank you.      Dr. SHALER:  Thank you for calling.      FLATOW:  Is there any unfinished work?      Dr. SHALER:  Oh, yes.  Like I said, there's over 1,100 people we have not      yet identified and I don't think I'll ever feel good about not      having--about being unsuccessful in not identifying them.  But by the      same token, I felt like we did everything we could have at the time.  In      that respect, I feel comfortable in what we did, but it's always      unsettling when you can't finish the job you want to start--that you      started.      FLATOW:  Is it--will it never be solved because the samples, the DNA      samples, are just not  good enough anymore or could we pull them out with      some kind of new technology?      Dr. SHALER:  I think that there's new technology that could be used to      analyze these samples sometime in the distant future.  I think it's      possible.  There are some samples there still have DNA.      FLATOW:  What are your thoughts about what to do with these remains that      are not identified?      Dr. SHALER:  Well, we have samples--or I had samples in the laboratory      from each of the remains that were taken from the World Trade Center site      and also from Staten Island.  And these are frozen at minus 80 degrees in      the laboratory.  So these are available for reanalysis at some time in      the future. The other remains, the larger pieces, have been dried,      desiccated, if you will, and they are--and sealed so that they can't      deteriorate any further. And these will be interred sometime at the      memorial site when they build a new memorial in Lower Manhattan.  And      these will be accessible by personnel from the Medical Examiner's Office      so that if families want those remains back, if new identifications are      made, they'll be able to get their loved ones back.      FLATOW:  Talking about identifying the remains still left over from the      bombing of the World--the plane crashing in the World Trade Center on      TALK OF THE NATION/SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.      And we should not forget about the bombing that--the plane crashing that      occurred in Washington that day also.  So that's a different forensic      problem?      Dr. SHALER:  It's a similar forensic problem.  You now, they made those      identifications fairly quickly and that was done by the Armed Forces DNA      Identification Laboratory.  And they did a great job.  They also      identified the people who died in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, the night. . .      FLATOW:  Yeah, yeah, OK.      Dr. SHALER:  . . . the people who died from that crash.      You know, there's one thing that is really bothersome about this and this      has to do with the response of the federal government to the Katrina.      And we've identified a huge void in our ability to mobilize resources to      help people from natural disasters.  The World Trade Center was a      terrorist event and funding for that was immediate and fast and we were      able to basically do anything we needed to do.  The Katrina is an      entirely different matter.  It took such a long time to marshal the      resources so that even the DNA process could begin.  And it's just now      beginning after all this time.      And what I've learned is that the National Incident Management System,      the National Response System, has no provision for identifying the      remains of people who die in mass disasters.  And I think that's really a      tragedy because the only thing it allows for is somebody to guard the      remains.  But there's nothing in the National Response Plan for handling      the mortuary affairs that are required to return loved ones back to their      families.  And this is something that should be corrected.  And it's in      the National Response Plan now--I mean, it's not there.      FLATOW:  Yeah, we've talked about what to do with the next either      epidemic, outbreak, you know, the flu, whatever where hundreds of      thousands, perhaps millions of people would die and one of the things      that was brought up was what do you do with all--you know the mortuary      situation, with the bodies?      Dr. SHALER:  Well, it's a huge problem.      FLATOW:  Right.      Dr. SHALER:  And one of the lessons that's coming out of Katrina and the      tsunami and the World Trade Center is that these processes take      infinitely longer than the initial recovery or rescue operations.  Years.      FLATOW:  Mm-hmm.  And it's so--it takes money and it takes a plan--some      plan to come up with.      Dr. SHALER:  You have to have a plan in place.  You have to have the      mechanism to fund it, and then you have to find people who can do it.      FLATOW:  Where would you--as someone who's been through this, what      department would you put this under or would you create a whole separate      department?      Dr. SHALER:  Well, the obvious place would be Homeland Security, but      apparently Homeland Security doesn't quite know what to do with--in the      mortuary affairs business.  So they've relegated it to Health and Human      Services and they're kind of struggling to figure out what to do with it.      So right now there's nobody who's willing to take up the baton and run      with it. I think that Human Health--Health and Human Services could be a      place to do it.  It really doesn't matter where as long as somebody has      the responsibility for it.  Homeland Security--FEMA is under Homeland      Security.  That's where the money should be coming from.  Whoever FEMA      gives the money to, whether it's Health and Human Services or--it doesn't      matter as long as it gets done.      FLATOW:  Finally, you said--you talked about what a terrific journey this      was, what an emotional journey this was for you.  Where do you go from      here?      Dr. SHALER:  Well, like I said, I've embarked on this program at Penn      State to create this forensic program, which is going to help students      understand about these processes and what happens in mass disasters in      addition to being just great forensic scientists.  I believe that the      solution to the preparedness problem is education.  You know, we're      spending an awful lot of money educating first responders and getting      people--getting mass disaster plans in place, but nobody is considering      what--the education of the young people coming up who might have to      handle some of these in the future.  You know, this--we could have      another big one next year but it might be another 10 years before we have      a big one and we'll have a whole new set of people in there who need to      be educated.  And I think that the education process begins with freshmen      coming into college and you take them through graduate school and you      prepare them to handle these things.      FLATOW:  Mm-hmm.      Dr. SHALER:  Because if they have a background for it nobody knows what's      going to happen and every incident is going to be different, but there      are certain basic things that you need to put into place and certain      educational processes than need to be in place so that these young people      have an idea of how to approach the problem.  You can't define. . .      FLATOW:  All right, Robert Shaler. . .      Dr. SHALER:  . . . exactly the problem, but you can tell--you can get them      started.      FLATOW:  And good luck to you in that effort.      Dr. SHALER:  Thank you.      FLATOW:  Thank you very much for taking time to join us today.

I'm Ira Flatow in New York.       IRA FLATOW, host:       For the rest of the hour, we're going to take a look at the massive      effort to identify the remains of those who were killed in the September      11th attacks on the World Trade Center in New York.  We remember that      clear September morning so well:  two planes, confusion, chaos, collapse,      death, thousands of victims. After the towers fell, nearly 20,000      fragments, pieces of human bodies, were collected from the World Trade      Center sites and later from the Fresh Kills landfill in Staten Island,      New York.  The massive job of trying to match those pieces to a face, to      a mother, a sister, a husband, a friend, fell into the hands of my next      guest.       Normally he's used to dealing with carefully collected DNA evidence from      crimes on the scene, from rapes, from homicides.  Nothing prepared him      for the work such as a mass tragedy that was presented to him.  He's      author of a new book, \"Who They Were:  Inside the World Trade Center DNA      Story; The Unprecedented Effort to Identify the Missing. \"  Robert Shaler      is the former director of the forensic biology department in the office      of the chief medical examiner of New York, and he has now--joining us      from WPSU, a member station, because he is now a professor of      biochemistry and molecular biology at Penn State University.       Welcome to the program.       Dr. ROBERT SHALER (Penn State University; Author, \"Who They Were\"):      Thank you.  It's--glad to be here.       FLATOW:  This--you know, reading this book, there's--it's almost      cathartic for you, is it not?  It's a very emotional book.       Dr. SHALER:  Yeah, I think it was.  It was one of the--when I finally      made the decision to write the book, I found that it was something that I      just couldn't stop doing.  I had to get it finished in order to feel      better for myself.       FLATOW:  Tell us what you were doing that day.       Dr. SHALER:  I was at a staff meeting, and one of the staff members in my      lab came and knocked on the door and said a small plane has hit the World      Trade Center, and they want to set up a temporary morgue in Lower      Manhattan, and would it be all right if I go along with them?  And I      said, `Sure. '  And I followed him downstairs, and by the time we got      downstairs, we knew that there was at least one major--one airliner had      hit one of the buildings and the medical examiner's office was mobilizing      to go downtown to Midtown--to Lower Manhattan to set up a temporary      morgue.  We knew that there was a fire, and where there's a fire, there's      usually bodies, and so that was our job is to collect the bodies and      identify them.       FLATOW:  Hey, you write that you were, you know, set up to handle maybe      an airplane crash of a few hundred people as you might have to, you know,      if there were a plane crash in New York at one of the major airports, but      nothing on this scale.       Dr. SHALER:  Well, that's true.  You know, I was in charge of the largest      public forensic biology laboratory in the United States at that time, and      we had certain capacity, more so than most laboratories in the country.      And we felt fairly confident that we could handle an airplane crash of a      couple of hundred people.  And in fact, we did; we had the American      Airlines Flight 587 crash two months after the World Trade Center      buildings fell.  But when you're looking at 19,000-plus pieces and 2,749      people that die and everyone is fragmented, you--it's such an      overwhelming task, you can't do it all by yourself.       FLATOW:  So what did you have to do to get this work?  Did you have to      totally revamp the way you normally do work and collect the data?       Dr. SHALER:  Well, yeah.  The--we had to completely reorganize the      laboratory. The laboratory had to be divided into what we call disaster      teams, and we had to continue working rapes and homicides in the city of      New York, 'cause that's our primary mission.  And then, of course, the      World Trade Center gave us a secondary mission.  But we still had to      enlist other laboratories to help us, and at one time we had six      different laboratories around the country working with us.       FLATOW:  At what point did you realize that the old way of doing things      wasn't going to work; you'd have to just change everything?       Dr. SHALER:  Well, about the third week. . .       FLATOW:  Was it moments, hours, days, months?       Dr. SHALER:  Well, you know, it's one of these things where you have this      enormous task. . .       FLATOW:  Yeah.       Dr. SHALER:  . . . and you know it's a big task, but you just start doing      the things that you normally do to put processes in place.  And then you      get to the point and you think, you know, `I need help. '  And that      happened probably in the first part of that first week.  Tuesday was when      it happened, and by Friday we were talking to the state police about      having them help us.       FLATOW:  And how do you deal with the 20,000 pieces that need      identification?       Dr. SHALER:  Well, I don't know if how you deal with them is the way to      look at it.  If somebody gave me a stack of 20,000 pieces, I'd say, `It      can't be done. '  But what happens is they come in piecemeal.  You know,      you--came in, like, several hundred a day or a couple thousand a week.      It's not like you get all 20,000 at one time.  And the collection process      or the recovery process, as we call it, went on until May of the next      year, so it was a nine-month period where these pieces are coming in the      laboratory.       And so you set up processes to analyze them.  The first thing you do is      you have to categorize them, and you have to--you do that using bar codes      so that you don't mix something up.  And then you have to extract the      DNA, and once you extract the DNA then you have to analyze it, and then      once you analyze it you have to interpret it, and then once you interpret      it you have to see if it matches anybody.  So it's a very--it's a      stepwise process.  All the steps weren't in place when it started, and we      had to build a number of those processes from scratch in order to get it      all done.       FLATOW:  So the FBI coding system that you used just wasn't going to      work.       Dr. SHALER:  Well, that's true, and the reason for that is that the FBI's      system is built upon being able to obtain high-quality DNA.  And the FBI      coding system is called CODIS, which is like a national DNA index that we      commonly use or routinely use to identify rapists and murderers who've      been arrested in the past, and then we can compare their DNA against DNA      found at the crime scene, for example.  And that's a direct match, and      it's a very fairly simple and easy thing to do, and most of the DNA you      get is in good enough condition that you have almost full or complete DNA      profiles.       FLATOW:  Hang on to that. . .       Dr. SHALER:  The World Trade Center. . .       FLATOW:  Hang on, 'cause we're--I don't want to interrupt your flow, but      I wanted to give you more time to give us the full story.  So stay with      us; we'll be right back after this short break.       I'm Ira Flatow.  This is TALK OF THE NATION/SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.       (Soundbite of music)       FLATOW:  You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION/SCIENCE FRIDAY.  I'm Ira      Flatow.       We're talking with my guest, Robert Shaler, who is former director of the      forensic biology department of the office of the chief medical examiner      of New York, and who's the gentleman who was in charge of, you know, the      DNA, identifying the 20,000 different forensic pieces of DNA that needed      to be identified, parts of people from the World Trade Center; author of      the new book \"Who They Were:  Inside the World Trade Center DNA Story;      The Unprecedented Effort to Identify the Missing. \"  Our number:  1 (800)      989-8255; 1 (800) 989-TALK.       Dr. Shaler, when I rudely interrupted you, you were telling us about the      limitations of the identification system that you were using at--the FBI      system; is that correct?       Dr. SHALER:  Well, most public forensic DNA laboratories utilize the      FBI's CODIS system, which is the national DNA index, and we use this to      identify rapists and murderers by matching crime-scene samples to DNA      taken from these people when they're arrested and incarcerated.       But the World Trade Center was different because the DNA was not very      good quality DNA and, in fact, it was what we call part--we got partial      DNA profiles.  And no one had ever done much work before to utilize      partial DNA profiles to make identifications, so we had to put a whole      series of new things, processes, into place in order to make      identifications.  And in order to do this, we convened a panel of about      30 scientists who sit down and discuss these issues.  These are people      who are geneticists, people who have had mass disaster experience,      although none of them had experience with something like this before.      And we put in rules to enable us to make these identifications so that we      were certain that we were not making mistakes.       FLATOW:  You write in your book that--and I'll quote from it--\"I decided      early in October 2001 to venture away from the tried and true\"--and you      say--use a term STRs--\"used daily in forensic work worldwide, because I      knew in my heart that path would not return enough of the missing to      their families. Unfortunately, the path I chose left my staff emotionally      drained and created problems for my laboratory's daily routines.  My      decision dragged out the testing by at least two years, probably longer,      and it almost killed me. While I'm sorry for the extra work and intense      emotional pressure I heaped upon my staff, I will never apologize for      bringing loved ones back to their families, loved ones who, without these      new technologies, would forever remain nameless. \"       Can you explain what that means, what you did and how--the new territory      you had to blaze there to make this work, and why it was such an      exhausting situation for you?       Dr. SHALER:  Well, the first thing I noticed was that, like I said, we      were having partial DNA profiles.  And the amount of DNA in the DNA      information we were getting was so skimpy that we'd never be able to make      identifications. So we had to--I had to look at other ways of analyzing      DNA.  The fact that there was DNA there gave me hope that maybe we could      do something about it.       So we looked at a couple of different things.  One, we looked at what we      call miniplexes, and these are different ways of looking at STRs, but in      such a way that we can look at smaller pieces of DNA than we had been      looking at in the past.  And so by looking at smaller pieces of      DNA--because what happens when DNA deteriorates, it fragments into      smaller and smaller pieces.  So I reasoned that if we could look at some      of those smaller pieces, we might be able to make more identifications.       So what happened--we had to have the laboratory reinvent a wheel, so to      speak. They had to go back and do research to make sure that these      techniques worked, and then we had to put them through an exhaustive      proficiency testing program. We had to make sure that what they were--the      results they were getting were valid on the kinds of samples that we had      in the laboratory.  So this took a year to get this work done.  So it      extended the process because we had to research it to make sure it was      working properly.       But on the day that we finally--we started that process in March 2002,      and in December 2002 we got our first day--actually, we started that      process in November 2001.  And by December 2002, on the first day we got      data, we got five new identifications.  And for all of us in the      laboratory at the medical examiner's office, it was, you know, high fives      and we were hugging each other because we just--we had been getting very,      very few identifications, and to get five new ones at exactly that--from      this new data, it was just a terrific feeling.       So that was one of the new things we did.  Another thing we did was to      look at even smaller pieces of DNA, and we used--identified mutations on      the DNA called SNPs, which stands for single nucleotide polymorphisms.      And although SNPs have been around for a long time and people know about      them and the pharmaceutical industry is using them, they'd never been      used for this kind of a purpose before.  They'd never been used to make      identifications in a mass disaster where the quality of the DNA is really      bad.       And so it wasn't until late in 2004 when we started getting all of the      data from the SNPs, and finally when we got that data, we were able to      make new identifications from that as well.  And what really happened as      far as new identifications was concerned is we were able to take these      new technologies and marry them to the tried-and-true technology.  So we      get a piece of the data from the original STR testing, we get another      piece of data from the miniplex testing, and then we get another piece of      data from SNP testing.  And we could make an identification that way.      Otherwise, without any of those technol--with the original technology, we      would never make the identification.       FLATOW:  But you would have to have something to compare it to, right, an      original?       Dr. SHALER:  That's exactly right, and there's two ways to do that.  One      is what we call direct testing, where you take a sample from the person      who's missing, which could be from a toothbrush; it could be a biopsy; it      could be biological fluid from a pair of underwear--and you take that DNA      and you get a DNA profile from it and you put that into a database.  And      then you take a DNA profile from a piece of tissue from a mass disaster,      and you put that into a database, and hopefully you have the appropriate      kind of software that can help you match those samples up.  So that's      called a direct test.       There's also an indirect test, which is much like a paternity test.  So      you get biological samples from the biological relatives of the person      who's missing, which could be a mother and a father, it could be brothers      and sisters or it could be combinations.  And what you're doing is you're      creating the genetic profile of that family.  And so when you get the DNA      profile of the fragment from the mass disaster site, you see if that      genetic profile fits into the genetic structure of the family.  And if it      does, then you have an identification.       FLATOW:  How did you go about collecting these samples from the families      or getting any of the originals to compare to?       Dr. SHALER:  Well, New York City set up family assistance centers, and      these were set up in various places around the city, but the one that was      there the longest was on Pier 94 on the--along the Hudson River.  And      families would come and they would be interviewed and they would give      samples.  We had provided police department with sort of like a road map      on the kinds of samples you could collect.  The problem is that the      police who were collecting the samples didn't understand DNA testing;      they don't understand identification using DNA.  They're not the. . .       FLATOW:  In fact, that was not really their job to do that in a normal      situation, right?       Dr. SHALER:  Oh, normally they don't do things like that, that's correct.       FLATOW:  Yeah.  You had to train them how to do that as sort of      on-the-job training.       Dr. SHALER:  Yeah, they had to be trained.  There wasn't enough time to      train them.       FLATOW:  Yeah.       Dr. SHALER:  The family assistance center, I believe, was set up--the      first one was set up on Thursday. . .       FLATOW:  Right.       Dr. SHALER:  . . . which would be the 13th of September.  And they weren't      prepared to do it, and so a lot of mistakes were made.  And samples were      collected inappropriately; they were labeled improperly.  And this      created a huge nightmare for us because we had to go back and sort out      these problems because if you don't, then you put the wrong name to a      piece you get from the mass disaster site, and you end up giving samples      back to a family that shouldn't have it.       FLATOW:  1 (800) 989-8255 is our number, 1 (800) 989-TALK.       Have all the samples been identified now?       Dr. SHALER:  No.  There are significant--there's about 1,100-plus samples      which have not been identified.  Some of these have very poor DNA quality      in them.  Some of them have absolutely no DNA left in them.  So the ones      with no DNA will never, ever be identified.  And these are typically the      samples that came from the hottest parts of the burning buildings.  These      are bones which are pure white; they have no biological material left in      them.  We call these kinds of bones creamains, very much like a cremated      sample.       FLATOW:  Were there any lessons from your experience with forensics and      the World Trade Center that might have or were possibly used in      identifying body with the Katrina victims?       Dr. SHALER:  Well, yeah.  They--every step in the identification process      created a lesson for us, and--because there were mistakes made all along      the way, and mistakes in that we just didn't have the processing set up      and we had to learn how to do them.  And what we learned is that people      tend to make the same mistakes over and over again, and when they began      getting in to make the identifications at Katrina, I was working with      some folks in Louisiana, trying to help them from making the same      mistakes that we did.  And by and large, they did correct some of those      mistakes, but then they had another set of problems that they had to work      with, and the problems that they had were different from the problems we      had in New York.       FLATOW:  You eventually had to give up--I don't mean give up the project,      but you had to stop trying to identify samples.  Why was that?       Dr. SHALER:  We ran out of technology.  We had taken the technology that      we were using as far as it could go, and we weren't getting any new      identifications out using it.  So it's time to what we call a pause and      back off for a while with the intent of, when new technology comes along,      we would pick up the project again.       FLATOW:  Were the families of the victims cooperative, or did they see      this as an intrusion?       Dr. SHALER:  They were the most terrific people I'd ever met in my life.      They helped us; they were supportive of us.  All they ever demanded from      us was to tell them the truth and not to pull punches on them.  You know,      they would come through the laboratory and we would explain the process      and what the DNA process was and what kind of data we were collecting and      how we interpreted it.       It was really important to them that we demystify the DNA process.  You      can just imagine, you get a piece of bone back which is maybe six inches      long, and that's the only piece you get back.  And they ask, `Well, how      did you make the identification? '  And you say, `Well, DNA made the      identification. '  Well, to a layperson, what does that mean?  They have      to have incredible faith that you as a scientists, that you as a      government worker are doing the kind of job and the quality job to now      enable you to make that kind of a decision and say that this piece of      bone came from your loved one.       And as most people are a little skeptical of government in general, you      have to do more than just say that to them; you have to show them and you      have to show them the controls you've put into place.  And this is      exactly what we did.  We had weekly meetings with these families.  We      talked to them.  Our lines were open to them.       FLATOW:  Yeah.       Dr. SHALER:  And on top of that, I think they felt a compassion that we      had for their loved ones.  And when I'd make an identification or my      other staff would make--others on my staff would make identifications, we      saw the pictures of these missing people on our computer screens, so we      could put a face to a name.  And I think the ones who saw that really      appreciated the fact that we did that.       FLATOW:  Were there people who just didn't want to know, don't--you      know. . .       Dr. SHALER:  Yes.       FLATOW:  Yeah, `I just can't deal with it. '       Dr. SHALER:  Yes.  There were a couple hundred families who just said,      `Look, we're not going to give you any way to make this identification.      We're not going to give you biological samples.  We're not going to give      you toothbrushes.  We believe that our loved one died down there, and      we'll'--I guess they had to go prove it to the courts so that they could      settle their estates, but they just didn't want the remains back.       FLATOW:  And what has all this done to you?       Dr. SHALER:  Well, it's given me a different perspective on life and      given me another cause in life, so to speak, and that cause has to come      through the education process.  One of the things I learned in going      through this is that the young people in this country are not prepared to      do this.  And I just thought that by coming to Penn State and starting a      new forensic science program that I could be instrumental in helping      young people get to the point where they could handle something like this      because part of our program is to talk to them about handling mass      disasters.       FLATOW:  Mm-hmm.  We're talking about forensics this hour on TALK OF THE      NATION/SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.       Talking with Richard Shaler, who is author of the new book \"Who They      Were: Inside the World Trade Center DNA Story:  The Unprecedented Effort      to Identify the Missing. \"  You were just telling us that--about the      center.  You are professor of biochemistry and molecular biology at Penn      State but you're now the director of the forensics program.  Is this      something for incoming freshmen, for everybody, or is it somebody who      wants to go into forensics?       Dr. SHALER:  Well, it's for both.  It's for forensic--for students who      are coming into the college as freshmen and they want to go into forensic      science. We've established a four-year baccalaureate program, which I      think is probably the most rigorous program in the country.  When I was a      director of the laboratory in New York City I invariably saw students who      walked through the doors looking for jobs who had even master's degrees,      didn't even know how to make up solutions, didn't know how to use a      pipette.  And I thought that was really bad.  How could anyone in a      position like I had hire someone who really didn't understand the very      basics of science?       FLATOW:  Mm-hmm.       Dr. SHALER:  So the program that I wanted when I came to Penn State was      to create a program that created first scientists and then forensic      scientists. And that's--and we've put together an extremely rigorous      program so that when these students leave Penn State, they're going to be      the best-trained and the best students to go into the profession.       Now we've also created a master's program and we're going to build upon      our baccalaureate program.  It is the most rigorous master's program I      know of in the country.  And our goal is to create quality scientists and      quality forensic scientists.  And one of the things we're doing with      these students is teaching them from the mistakes that others have made.      You know, if someone has made a mistake, these things get publicized in      the newspapers and you can go and get the information and you can find      out why the mistake was made.  And these become great teaching lessons      for students.  So that once they understand the underpinnings of the      profession, which is basic science, then they can go off and they      can--they'll be able to handle the rigors of the real world when they get      out.       FLATOW:  Have these forensic TV shows been a boon or a bane to you, do      you think?       Dr. SHALER:  Both.  They certainly create students who have an interest      in forensic science.       FLATOW:  I'll bet, yeah.       Dr. SHALER:  Yeah.  We have a freshman class of about 20 people, and, by      and large, most of them are there because of \"C. S. I. \"  And that's good      because it creates an interest in the profession.  But it also creates      unrealistic expectations on the parts of some of these students.  They      don't understand when they do this that they're not--that they're coming      to school to be scientists.  They think that they're going to be doing      crime scene investigations and a little bit of science along with it.       FLATOW:  Shine a light on it and you get the answer, yeah.       Dr. SHALER:  Well, that's true.  And, you know, that's what you see on      \"C. S. I. \"       FLATOW:  Right.       Dr. SHALER:  Now \"C. S. I. \" has done a good thing.  It has created a person      who doesn't really exist but maybe that person should exist.  So we're      trying to create that person in a world where that person doesn't exist.       FLATOW:  Mm-hmm.  But first you have to break them of the old idea, the      old stereotype.       Dr. SHALER:  Yeah, and what's going to happen, I think, is these students      who come in the door and into our program and some of them are going to      realize that they're not cut out to be scientists.  But that doesn't mean      they can't go into law enforcement and that doesn't mean we can't teach      them the principles of crime scene investigation and crime scene      reconstruction.  We can certainly do that and we will and we are.  But I      don't think they're going to graduate with degrees in science.  They may      end up in crime law and justice or something like that. . .       FLATOW:  Mm-hmm.       Dr. SHALER:  . . . but they'll still be productive members of the law      enforcement community.       FLATOW:  Yup.  We're talking with Robert Shaler, former director of the      Forensic Biology Department of the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner      in New York.  He is now talking about his new course at Penn State      University.  He is author of \"Who They Were:  Inside the World Trade      Center DNA Story:  The Unprecedented Effort to Identify the Missing. \"       I know you're all on the line waiting to talk to him.  We'll take a short      break, go to the phones, take your calls, talk about the investigations,      the forensics that are involved in the World Trade Center.  So stay with      us. We'll be right back after this break.       I'm Ira Flatow.  This is TALK OF THE NATION/SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.       (Announcements)       FLATOW:  You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION/SCIENCE FRIDAY.  I'm Ira      Flatow.       We're talking this hour about using DNA to identify victims in the World      Trade Center and 9/11 attacks with my guest Robert Shaler, former      director of the Forensic Biology Department in the Office of the Chief      Medical Examiner of New York.  He's author of \"Who They Were:  Inside the      World Trade Center DNA Story:  The Unprecedented Effort to Identify the      Missing. \"       Our number, 1 (800) 989-8255.  Let's go to the phones to Michael in Grand      Rapids.  Hi, Michael.       MICHAEL (Caller):  Hi, Ira, great show.       FLATOW:  Thank you.  Go ahead.       MICHAEL:  I've got two little questions.  One, I was wondering if there      was any DNA collected from service animals or people's personal pets that      might have been in the building and if that impacted the process?  And      did they identify and collect DNA from all of the people that were in the      aircraft that hit the buildings?       FLATOW:  You mean the terrorists?       MICHAEL:  I'll take my answers off the air.       FLATOW:  OK.  I think he meant the terrorists.  Did you collect any      terrorist DNA?  Could you identify them?       Dr. SHALER:  We identified three of the terrorists.  I was surprised      because I didn't think any of the--anyone from the planes would be      identified because just the way the planes hit and then exploded.  But      apparently--rumor was that passengers were herded to the back of the      plane and guarded there so that when the planes hit the buildings and      exploded it apparently blew--fragmented them but also blew them out of      the main fireball.  And so we were able to identify some of them.  And      when we started seeing identifications of people on the planes coming      through, we though maybe we would be able to identify some of the      terrorists, as well.  So we contacted the FBI to see if the FBI      would--had any information or any DNA from the terrorists or had access      to it.  And it took us about a year to get that all together.  We finally      got a letter from the FBI that gave us 10 DNA profiles that were coded.      We didn't have names associated with them, but presumably from the      terrorists, and we made a couple of identifications immediately.  And      then a third one came at a later time.       FLATOW:  You say in your book that--you describe working with the FBI as      `an exasperating experience. '       Dr. SHALER:  Yeah, well they--you know, the FBI is--has its own way of      doing things and I guess getting approvals through the system is tedious      and tough. And it's hard to work with them because they aren't always      very cooperative. There's always something going on that--I don't know      what it--it's hard to say what it is, but just getting them to work with      you and cooperate is tough. You know, when this first happened they came      right away and they wanted to help us set up this DNA network so that we      could make identifications, but the system that had been set up was not      geared toward making identifications in a mass disaster.  It's geared      toward identifying people who are in jail and who have left samples at      crime scenes.  So it doesn't--it didn't do the kinds of things that I      wanted to have done and--or needed to have done.  And so we had a meeting      and we talked about these things and the best ways to get it done. And      the FBI had their way--what they thought was the way to do it and we      had--we learned that really wasn't the best way to go about it.  And we      found that to be true.       Getting the terrorists' DNA was another issue.  It just took like a year      to get it done and I could never understand why.  Maybe they had to go      out and go to the places where these people lived and actually collect      samples and that took time.  But I just don't know what took so long.       FLATOW:  Mm-hmm.  1 (800) 989-8255 is our number.  What kind of samples      did you have to work with?  Were there a lot of tiny fragments?  Were      they big body parts?  What were the majority of them?       Dr. SHALER:  Well, they were both.  We had, I think, 200 and some fairly      intact bodies.  These were torsos, top and bottom torsos, arms.  We had      arms, we had legs, we had feet, we had hands, we had heads.  But the vast      majority of the pieces were very small, like an inch of a bone or just      some tissue, things like that.       FLATOW:  You said that when you worked with bones even you, the grizzled      forensic expert, had trouble with that.       Dr. SHALER:  Yeah.  You know, when you work in the forensic world you see      some pretty strange things.  And, you know, you get used to this.  You      get used to dead bodies.  You get used to being in an autopsy room      watching autopsies.  I don't think I'd ever want to do an autopsy, but      you still get used to seeing it.  And you go to crime scenes and you see      bodies.  And you're used to smelling things that smell pretty bad      sometimes.  But it's isolated. It doesn't happen every day.  But when you      see this--it's like an endless stream of human destruction coming through      the door and mounds of it and just piece after piece after piece of this,      it wears you down.       FLATOW:  1 (800) 989-8255.  Let's go to Susan in San Francisco.  Hi,      Susan.       SUSAN (Caller):  Hello.  Hello?       FLATOW:  Yes, go ahead.       SUSAN:  Hi.  I was one of the attorneys who worked for the city      attorney's office and was at the Family Assistance Center on Pier 94.      And I just wanted to say thank you for the work you did.  It was an      overwhelming experience.  As you just said, it--the day after day was      extremely draining but I also found it a tremendous opportunity to help      other people in one of the most vulnerable positions anyone could be.      There was a great compassion.  I agree there was a great compassion to      the work.  There was a great sensitivity.  Even the way this pier was      transformed into a family assistance center, that the curtains--curtains      created little rooms and police worked quietly in a little curtained      room.  And we attorneys interviewed families in our little areas.       The role of the attorneys--the Chief Medical Examiners Office I guess was      technically our client--we were interviewing the families, helping them      establish through sworn testimony that the loved one was missing and      there was no body, had, in fact, died at the World Trade Center.  So we      were the ones who were helping them track down, apart from the DNA      evidence, enough information for the family to go to court without a body      and demon--prove to the court there was a--their loved one had died so      they could go through the other necessary paperwork.  It was--I mean,      just listening to you speak, has brought a lot of tears and, again, I      just wanted to say thank you.  It was a wonderful opportunity and there      was a lot of compassion, a lot of hard, hard dedication that went on for      months and months and months to do as complete a job as possible for all      those people.       FLATOW:  Thank you for calling.       Dr. SHALER:  Thank you.       SUSAN:  Sure.  Thank you, bye-bye.       FLATOW:  Lot of compassion in that book.       Dr. SHALER:  Well, I think that's what it was about.  I think one of the      things that we tend to forget when mass disasters or mass fatality events      take place is that they're really all about people.  Even Katrina is the      same thing.  We try to rescue the living first and then we try to recover      the bodies so that we can return them to their families.  You know,      there's always going to be an economic loss because buildings are going      to be damaged and the possessions of people are going to be lost.  But      when you come right down to it, it's about people and it's about      families.       FLATOW:  Mm-hmm.  1 (800) 989-8255.  Jenn in Chattanooga.  Hi, Jenn.       JENN (Caller):  Hi, how are you?       FLATOW:  Hi, go ahead.       JENN:  I saw a program over the Christmas holiday about two women, one on      the West Coast, one on the East Coast, who had some DNA testing, one for      a transplant and one to determine paternity.  And they both had really      unique cases where they didn't match the DNA of their children.  And they      did a lot of investigation and determined that they actually had two      separate strands of DNA within one person.  And they had to look really      hard to find in certain organs or certain body systems the DNA that      didn't match and then to find the DNA that did match their family's.  And      I'm wondering if that's just sort of an emerging part of DNA science and      whether anything--when you're trying to determine identity, if that's      ever brought into consideration?       Dr. SHALER:  You know, this is such a rare event that it certainly is      puzzling when it happens, and, certainly, biologically, it's possible.      And I'm--I know of those two cases you're talking about and they      certainly created a lot of problems for those families and for the      scientists involved because it becomes a real puzzle that has to be put      back together.  But there is a good scientific explanation for it and the      reason for that mosaic problem that occurs; it's well-known.  It's just      extremely rare.       FLATOW:  1 (800) 989-8255.  Mary in Madison, Wisconsin.  Hi, Mary.       MARY (Caller):  Hi, how are you?       FLATOW:  Fine, how are you?       MARY:  Good.  I was just calling to thank the gentleman that you're      speaking with today and to extend my thanks to all of his staff.  I lost      my brother on 9/11.  I personally spent a fair amount of time in the      Medical Examiner's Office of New York, both immediately after 9/11 and      then some months and years after as they went through the process of      identification, and they were able to identify my brother's remains, and      we were able to bring them home.  And I just wanted to call and say thank      you.       Dr. SHALER:  I'm glad we did that.       FLATOW:  Thank you for calling.       MARY:  Thank you.       Dr. SHALER:  Thank you for calling.       FLATOW:  Is there any unfinished work?       Dr. SHALER:  Oh, yes.  Like I said, there's over 1,100 people we have not      yet identified and I don't think I'll ever feel good about not      having--about being unsuccessful in not identifying them.  But by the      same token, I felt like we did everything we could have at the time.  In      that respect, I feel comfortable in what we did, but it's always      unsettling when you can't finish the job you want to start--that you      started.       FLATOW:  Is it--will it never be solved because the samples, the DNA      samples, are just not  good enough anymore or could we pull them out with      some kind of new technology?       Dr. SHALER:  I think that there's new technology that could be used to      analyze these samples sometime in the distant future.  I think it's      possible.  There are some samples there still have DNA.       FLATOW:  What are your thoughts about what to do with these remains that      are not identified?       Dr. SHALER:  Well, we have samples--or I had samples in the laboratory      from each of the remains that were taken from the World Trade Center site      and also from Staten Island.  And these are frozen at minus 80 degrees in      the laboratory.  So these are available for reanalysis at some time in      the future. The other remains, the larger pieces, have been dried,      desiccated, if you will, and they are--and sealed so that they can't      deteriorate any further. And these will be interred sometime at the      memorial site when they build a new memorial in Lower Manhattan.  And      these will be accessible by personnel from the Medical Examiner's Office      so that if families want those remains back, if new identifications are      made, they'll be able to get their loved ones back.       FLATOW:  Talking about identifying the remains still left over from the      bombing of the World--the plane crashing in the World Trade Center on      TALK OF THE NATION/SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.       And we should not forget about the bombing that--the plane crashing that      occurred in Washington that day also.  So that's a different forensic      problem?       Dr. SHALER:  It's a similar forensic problem.  You now, they made those      identifications fairly quickly and that was done by the Armed Forces DNA      Identification Laboratory.  And they did a great job.  They also      identified the people who died in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, the night. . .       FLATOW:  Yeah, yeah, OK.       Dr. SHALER:  . . . the people who died from that crash.       You know, there's one thing that is really bothersome about this and this      has to do with the response of the federal government to the Katrina.      And we've identified a huge void in our ability to mobilize resources to      help people from natural disasters.  The World Trade Center was a      terrorist event and funding for that was immediate and fast and we were      able to basically do anything we needed to do.  The Katrina is an      entirely different matter.  It took such a long time to marshal the      resources so that even the DNA process could begin.  And it's just now      beginning after all this time.       And what I've learned is that the National Incident Management System,      the National Response System, has no provision for identifying the      remains of people who die in mass disasters.  And I think that's really a      tragedy because the only thing it allows for is somebody to guard the      remains.  But there's nothing in the National Response Plan for handling      the mortuary affairs that are required to return loved ones back to their      families.  And this is something that should be corrected.  And it's in      the National Response Plan now--I mean, it's not there.       FLATOW:  Yeah, we've talked about what to do with the next either      epidemic, outbreak, you know, the flu, whatever where hundreds of      thousands, perhaps millions of people would die and one of the things      that was brought up was what do you do with all--you know the mortuary      situation, with the bodies?       Dr. SHALER:  Well, it's a huge problem.       FLATOW:  Right.       Dr. SHALER:  And one of the lessons that's coming out of Katrina and the      tsunami and the World Trade Center is that these processes take      infinitely longer than the initial recovery or rescue operations.  Years.       FLATOW:  Mm-hmm.  And it's so--it takes money and it takes a plan--some      plan to come up with.       Dr. SHALER:  You have to have a plan in place.  You have to have the      mechanism to fund it, and then you have to find people who can do it.       FLATOW:  Where would you--as someone who's been through this, what      department would you put this under or would you create a whole separate      department?       Dr. SHALER:  Well, the obvious place would be Homeland Security, but      apparently Homeland Security doesn't quite know what to do with--in the      mortuary affairs business.  So they've relegated it to Health and Human      Services and they're kind of struggling to figure out what to do with it.      So right now there's nobody who's willing to take up the baton and run      with it. I think that Human Health--Health and Human Services could be a      place to do it.  It really doesn't matter where as long as somebody has      the responsibility for it.  Homeland Security--FEMA is under Homeland      Security.  That's where the money should be coming from.  Whoever FEMA      gives the money to, whether it's Health and Human Services or--it doesn't      matter as long as it gets done.       FLATOW:  Finally, you said--you talked about what a terrific journey this      was, what an emotional journey this was for you.  Where do you go from      here?       Dr. SHALER:  Well, like I said, I've embarked on this program at Penn      State to create this forensic program, which is going to help students      understand about these processes and what happens in mass disasters in      addition to being just great forensic scientists.  I believe that the      solution to the preparedness problem is education.  You know, we're      spending an awful lot of money educating first responders and getting      people--getting mass disaster plans in place, but nobody is considering      what--the education of the young people coming up who might have to      handle some of these in the future.  You know, this--we could have      another big one next year but it might be another 10 years before we have      a big one and we'll have a whole new set of people in there who need to      be educated.  And I think that the education process begins with freshmen      coming into college and you take them through graduate school and you      prepare them to handle these things.       FLATOW:  Mm-hmm.       Dr. SHALER:  Because if they have a background for it nobody knows what's      going to happen and every incident is going to be different, but there      are certain basic things that you need to put into place and certain      educational processes than need to be in place so that these young people      have an idea of how to approach the problem.  You can't define. . .       FLATOW:  All right, Robert Shaler. . .       Dr. SHALER:  . . . exactly the problem, but you can tell--you can get them      started.       FLATOW:  And good luck to you in that effort.       Dr. SHALER:  Thank you.       FLATOW:  Thank you very much for taking time to join us today.

I'm Ira Flatow.      On December 30th, three months after the fiscal year had already begun,      President Bush signed the last of the 2006 budget appropriations bills.      Included was money for fighting the avian flu, for rebuilding New Orleans      and for military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.  How did science      fare in all those late-night number-crunching sessions?  Well, that      depends.  If you're working on defense research, you did pretty good.  If      you're working at NIH, maybe not so good; you got your first drop--first      cutback since 1970 over there.  And according to an analysis by the      American Association for the Advancement of Science, 90 percent--97      percent--97 percent of the budget increase goes to just two areas:      defense weapons development and human space exploration.      Joining more now to talk more about it is someone who had been following      the budget dealings very closely.  Kei Koizumi is the director of the R&D      Budget and Policy Program at the American Association for the Advancement      of Science, the AAAS, in Washington.  He joins us by phone.      Thanks for talking with us today.      Mr. KEI KOIZUMI (Director, R&D Budget and Policy Program, American      Association for the Advancement of Science):  Hi.  Good afternoon.      FLATOW:  Hi.  First, tell us what agencies are we talking about?  Which      ones are included when we talk about research and development budgets?      Mr. KOIZUMI:  Well, a lot of agencies fund R&D in the federal government,      about 20 different ones, and they range from people like NASA doing space      R&D to the Defense Department, defense research, and the National      Institutes of Health, which funds health research.  And there are, of      course, a lot of others.  And as you said, in this 2006 budget that the      president just signed, only two of them really have a significant      increase, and those are DOD for weapons and NASA for space.      FLATOW:  And this is sort of surprising; at least NIH used to get a lot      of money in increases.      Mr. KOIZUMI:  Right, 'cause, you know, between 1990 and 2003, Congress      embarked on this campaign to double the NIH budget over a five-year      period. So during those years, NIH was getting increases of about 15      percent a year. But since then, you know, the budget has flattened out,      and for 2006, as we said, NIH budget is getting cut for the first time in      almost 40 years.      FLATOW:  Does this kind of budget increase and cuts in some places and      increases in the Pentagon money and space explorations--does that      surprise you, given the priorities the president has set?      Mr. KOIZUMI:  It's not really a surprise because all along the president      and the Congress have said that they would restrain domestic spending in      an attempt to get the budget deficit under control.  And within that      larger priority, the president has long made it a priority to increase      defense spending, and he announced the division of getting humans back to      the moon in the next decade and then eventually on to Mars.  So it's      clear that--in this budget that those two areas would do very well.      What's a little bit disappointing is that other areas not only didn't do      well but in some cases investment falling.      FLATOW:  And I imagine researchers are very upset about this.      Mr. KOIZUMI:  Yes, well, a lot of them are, especially in the biomedical      field, because, you know, they have--they're used to getting, you know,      some fairly substantial increases, at least in the last decade, and then      at least a few increases in recent years.  But now they'll be dealing      with budget cuts.      FLATOW:  And is there a feeling that the space program, the manned--the      human space program, going to the moon and then to Mars, the president's      vision here, is eating into the other projects?      Mr. KOIZUMI:  Well, there's definitely that feeling, especially for the      scientific community that looks to NASA for its funding. . .      FLATOW:  Yeah.      Mr. KOIZUMI:  . . . because NASA's budget is going up, but not nearly enough      to do everything that NASA has traditionally done.  In order to build      this next generation of human spacecraft, NASA is cutting its other      investments in areas such as astronomy, biological research,      environmental monitoring of the earth and also aeronautics.      FLATOW:  How did the National Science Foundation do?      Mr. KOIZUMI:  Well, the National Science Foundation received a small      increase in its budget, which is very important since NSF is the primary      funding source for university researchers in areas other than medicine.      But NSF hasn't done very well in the past few years, so in real terms,      NSF has less money to spend this year than it has in the last few years.      So it's. . .      FLATOW:  Are. . .      Mr. KOIZUMI:  . . . going to be a painful adjustment for many of these      researchers.      FLATOW:  Are there any major projects that are outstanding that we would      know about that--who will have to be cut back from the budget?      Mr. KOIZUMI:  Well, there won't be--there's not one big project that you      could point to, because federal research is funded in, you know,      thousands of grants given to researchers around the country, and they're      all taking, you know, small pieces of this quest for new knowledge.      Unfortunately or fortunately, I mean, this impact is going to be felt in      pieces, and the true impacts may not be clear for years or maybe even      decades to come because research is an investment into our future.      FLATOW:  Yeah.  Kei Koizumi, I want to thank you for taking time to talk      with us.      Mr. KOIZUMI:  Sure.      FLATOW:  Have a good weekend.

Mr. KOIZUMI:  Well, there's definitely that feeling, especially for the      scientific community that looks to NASA for its funding. . .       FLATOW:  Yeah.       Mr. KOIZUMI:  . . . because NASA's budget is going up, but not nearly enough      to do everything that NASA has traditionally done.  In order to build      this next generation of human spacecraft, NASA is cutting its other      investments in areas such as astronomy, biological research,      environmental monitoring of the earth and also aeronautics.       FLATOW:  How did the National Science Foundation do?       Mr. KOIZUMI:  Well, the National Science Foundation received a small      increase in its budget, which is very important since NSF is the primary      funding source for university researchers in areas other than medicine.      But NSF hasn't done very well in the past few years, so in real terms,      NSF has less money to spend this year than it has in the last few years.      So it's. . .       FLATOW:  Are. . .       Mr. KOIZUMI:  . . . going to be a painful adjustment for many of these      researchers.       FLATOW:  Are there any major projects that are outstanding that we would      know about that--who will have to be cut back from the budget?       Mr. KOIZUMI:  Well, there won't be--there's not one big project that you      could point to, because federal research is funded in, you know,      thousands of grants given to researchers around the country, and they're      all taking, you know, small pieces of this quest for new knowledge.      Unfortunately or fortunately, I mean, this impact is going to be felt in      pieces, and the true impacts may not be clear for years or maybe even      decades to come because research is an investment into our future.       FLATOW:  Yeah.  Kei Koizumi, I want to thank you for taking time to talk      with us.       Mr. KOIZUMI:  Sure.       FLATOW:  Have a good weekend.       He's director of the R&D Budget and Policy Program at the AAAS in      Washington. ", "section": "Science", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2006 NPR.  All rights reserved.

It's also      been used on the lone survivor of the Sago Mine explosion.  Dr. James      Bernat is a professor of neurology at Dartmouth Medical School.  He says      the goal of a medically induced coma is to reduce the work of brain cells      and protect them from increased pressure inside the skull or after an      event such as a stroke.      Dr. JAMES BERNAT (Dartmouth Medical School):  The medically induced coma      is intended to reduce the metabolic demand of the brain cells.  When one      uses a drug like pentobarbital, a barbiturate, the coma should be      completely reversible, and it should induce no permanent damage itself.      NORRIS:  So it's reversible, it is a temporary state.  In that sense, it      differs from a coma brought on by disease or trauma.      Dr. BERNAT:  Right.  Most comas that are the result of stroke, head      trauma, cardiac arrest with lack of blood flow to the brain are a much      more serious problem from which there is usually a permanent problem.      NORRIS:  Is this seen as an emergency procedure, only done as a last      resort?      Dr. BERNAT:  It often is done as a last resort.  It has certain      complications and it is not uniformly effective.  But it can be effective      in carefully selected cases.      NORRIS:  What are some of the risks and complications?      Dr. BERNAT:  Well, when you use the doses of pentobarbital that are      effective to induce a coma and reduction of pressure, it lowers blood      pressure, and that can be a serious problem.  It also can dull the heart      muscle and cause heart failure, which can further impair circulation.  It      also renders people more susceptible to infections while receiving this      medically induced coma.      NORRIS:  And while patients are in this comatose state, are doctors able      to monitor the patient while they're in this stage?      Dr. BERNAT:  Yes, the monitoring during this is exceedingly important.      One way we routinely do the monitoring is by electroencephalography,      measuring brain waves.  By merely looking at the brain waves, we can get      a pretty good picture of how deep the coma is, even if the person is      unresponsive.  There's other types of monitoring.  One can measure      intracranial pressure directly. The other monitoring, of course, that is      done in any intensive care unit would be to make sure that the person      isn't suffering any side effects of this therapy.      NORRIS:  I understand that this is a relatively new procedure.  How      common is it, and is it at all controversial?      Dr. BERNAT:  I believe it is still controversial.  One of our specialty      societies has written an advisory paper about it warning of some of the      risks. It can be very effective, so certainly when it works, it works.      NORRIS:  Doctor, what would be considered a good outcome for someone      who's been placed in a medically induced coma?      Dr. BERNAT:  Generally, once the medications are withdrawn, the treatment      itself should cause no harm.  But what the problem is is why they were      given that in the first place.  And so it isn't that the medically      induced coma causes a problem as much as it is the underlying disorder      for which the pentobarbital coma was prescribed.  A good outcome would be      reduction of intracranial pressure to more or less normal range to allow      the person to recover.      NORRIS:  Dr. Bernat, thanks so much for talking to us.      Dr. BERNAT:  You're welcome.      NORRIS:  Dr. James Bernat teaches neurology at Dartmouth Medical School.

I'm Michele Norris.      Tropical rain forests are often heralded as the ultimate in biodiversity.      From beetles to boa constrictors, they contain more forms of life than      anywhere else.  Well, it turns out that the backyards of Kansas, at least      in one way, have more variety than the rain forest.  NPR's Christopher      Joyce reports.      CHRISTOPHER JOYCE reporting:      If you know a child who likes digging in the dirt, you might want to tell      them about Noah Fierer.  He's a microbial ecologist.  That is, he studies      what's under foot.      Mr. NOAH FIERER (Microbial Ecologist):  Ever since I was a kid I loved      digging in the dirt.  It is, to some degree, such uncharted territory.      There's so--the number of things we don't know far outweigh the number of      things that we do know.      JOYCE:  We don't know, for example, how many kinds of microbes live in      the soil.  We're not even close.  Recent surveys suggest perhaps hundreds      of thousands of species in a spoonful of dirt.  For Fierer, that's      opportunity knocking.      Mr. FIERER:  We know that they're responsible for a whole slew of      different things and that the trick now is trying to unravel what they're      actually doing and who's doing what.      JOYCE:  To that end, Fierer trekked through the Amazon forest in Peru,      digging in the dirt.  He also collected soil from the Kansas prairie, the      New Mexico deserts and dozens of other locales along with fellow      ecologist Robert Jackson at Duke University.  They half expected that the      rain forest, with perhaps the world's most diverse collection of life,      would yield the most types of microbes, too.      Mr. FIERER:  And we were surprised to find the opposite in that the soils      from the tropics actually had lower levels of diversity than soils from      more temperate ecosystems.      JOYCE:  Even deserts?      Mr. FIERER:  Even deserts.  There's a high probability that in your      average backyard there's a higher diversity soil bacteria there than in      the Amazonian rain forest.      JOYCE:  Fierer says microbes apparently aren't like plants and insects      and birds.  The rain forest isn't a piece of heaven.  The soil is      actually too acidic to be hospitable to many bacteria.  Scientists say      they're finding out a lot of new things about soil microbes now that they      can track them down using DNA.  Otherwise, they're just too small and      numerous.  For example, scientists at the University of Colorado have      discovered that more microbes live in the Rockies under the snowpack in      winter than in the summer.      Fierer and Jackson report their findings in the Proceedings of the      National Academy of Sciences.  Fierer says soil microbes are a source of      new substances for pharmaceuticals, for example, and this might point      searchers closer to home.      Mr. FIERER:  The big question that's remaining and that we haven't even      started to touch is what are these guys doing down there?  What are these      bacteria doing in the soil?  And related to that is what sort of      chemicals are they producing?      JOYCE:  Fierer says he'll start focusing on identifying the actual      species next.  He expects he'll find some new ones, though it won't be a      ticket to fame.  He says new species of bacteria aren't charismatic      enough to actually get named.

Some      people worry that nano materials may pose new threats to human health and      the environment.  And a report released today argues that existing laws      and regulations probably are not enough to avoid the problems.  NPR's      Nell Boyce reports.      NELL BOYCE reporting:      Terry Davies used to work for the Environmental Protection Agency.  He's      spent over 30 years helping the government draft environmental      regulations, usually after some sort of crisis.      Mr. TERRY DAVIES:  If you look back at the history of most of the      environmental regulations, they're reactions to adverse events, to      disasters or oil spills or, you know, whatever.      BOYCE:  Davies hopes it will be different for nanotechnology.  He's just      finished a report for the Woodrow Wilson International Center for      Scholars, a research group set up by Congress.  Davies believes that with      nanotech, officials have a chance to take action before these tiny      engineered materials become widespread.  And he thinks new regulations      are definitely needed.      Mr. DAVIES:  The existing system is not well-tailored to deal with      nanotechnology.      BOYCE:  Nanotechnology has attracted billions of dollars in research      funding from the government and industry in recent years.  Here's why.      It turns out that shockingly small spheres or tubes made from ordinary      materials, like carbon and metal, can have different chemical and      biological properties than their normal-sized counterparts.  But studies      suggest these new properties might also mean new potential dangers.  Some      nanoparticles can be absorbed through the skin or get inhaled into the      lungs and create unexpected toxicity or immune reactions.  Davies says      there's been relatively little money spent on this kind of safety      research.      Mr. DAVIES:  We know so little about the hazards to the extent that there      are any from nanotechnology.  And what that means is that you need to      have a regulatory system that provides incentives to generate the      information.      BOYCE:  So far, no federal agency has put in place any nano-specific      regulations.  The EPA is designing a two-year voluntary program aimed at      collecting more safety information from industry.  That's according to      William Gulledge, chair of the Nanotechnology Panel at the American      Chemistry Council.      Mr. WILLIAM GULLEDGE (American Chemistry Council):  My sense is that they      will go through this process in the voluntary program before making any      decisions regarding the need or possibility of more regulations.      BOYCE:  Gulledge says that over the last year, other agencies have      started to gather information on things like possible health effects for      workers who manufacture small materials.  But he says the research is      still in early days.      Mr. GULLEDGE:  I think it's way too early to say that a new regulatory      framework needs to be created for nano materials.      BOYCE:  The Wilson Center report, of course, argues that this is exactly      the right time.

He joins me now.      Hello.      JON HERSKOVITZ reporting:      Hi.  Good morning.      MONTAGNE:  Did Hwang offer any further explanation for the fabricated      data?      HERSKOVITZ:  He took responsibility for the data coming out that ended up      being produced by his team.  But he also tried to shift blame for the      fabrication to junior researchers who are associated with the hospital      that provided human ova for his testing.  He thinks that there may have      been a conspiracy out to discredit him, and he's pointing the finger at      these researchers in this hospital.      MONTAGNE:  What was his explanation why they would have conspired against      him?      HERSKOVITZ:  There are many reasons.  One could be jealousy.  Others      could be that some people in South Korea weren't happy with this      university being so far advanced.  There may be conspiracy theories going      around, but I think he's looking at mostly jealousy from his fellow team      members and specifically from this hospital.      MONTAGNE:  Is there a possibility of criminal prosecution?  Did he break      any laws there in South Korea?      HERSKOVITZ:  Yes.  Prosecutors have started a criminal probe into Dr.      Hwang for misappropriation of state funds.  His lab received well over      $10 million, perhaps $20 million, in state funding for its research.  And      also, he received other perks from the state.  In addition, the      prosecutors are looking into Hwang's allegations of the conspiracy, so      the prosecutors have many things that they're looking at.  But these are      the two main things, the criminal probe against Hwang and Hwang's      accusations that someone was out to get him.      MONTAGNE:  Well, as this has, you know, sort of shaken down, is there any      part of his research on human cloning that was legitimate?      HERSKOVITZ:  Most of it has been proven to be fabricated.  In the final      report produced on Tuesday by Seoul National University, they did      indicate that Hwang was on to something with the creation of human      blastocytes, early embryos, but what he had done had been quite unstable.      They said that there was a very minor success, but almost all of the      data, all of his main claims, were based on fabricated data.      MONTAGNE:  So for this scientist that we've suddenly come to know based      on this work and then this scandal, is his career over?  What happens to      him now?      HERSKOVITZ:  Well, he said that today he's going to do his best to fade      into the sunset.  But there's still quite a number of people here who      support him, and he is one of the world's best scientists when it comes      to cloning of animals.  His team cloned the first dog, considered very      difficult to do because of the reproductive cycles.  He's cloned other      animals, as well. Human cloning is something that he has not been able to      do.  The embryonic stem cell research has also proved difficult, elusive      for him.  But he does have some accomplishments.

I'm Ira Flatow.      And for the rest of this hour, a look at the intersection of economics      and the environment and what it means for our planet.  But first, we're      going to give you a little quiz.  See if you can guess which country I'm      talking about.      It consumes more of the world's grain, steel and meat than any other      country. They mine and burn a quarter of the world's coal.  Six thousand      mine workers were killed in their mines in 2004.  Their military budget      is third behind the US and Russia, and they have plans to put a probe on      the moon in 2007. According to one estimate, about 81 percent--eight out      of 10--toys sold here in the US are made there, and about 80 percent of      all Christmas tree ornaments and decorations sold around the world are      made there.      Well, you probably have it by now.  I'm talking, of course, about China.      And according to my next guest, China's extraordinary economic growth is      going to stretch our already stressed natural systems past the breaking      point.  He says that at current growth rates, by 2031--that's about 25      years from now--China will have an appetite for oil larger than what the      whole world currently produces.      So what does that mean for the rest of us?  My next guests believes that      China is just the tip of the iceberg of a global economy that is      outgrowing the capacity of our Earth to support it, leading to a possible      collapse of our modern way of life.  Lester Brown is the founder and      president of the Earth Policy Institute.  His latest book is \"Plan B,      2. 0:  Rescuing a Planet Under Stress and a Civilization in Trouble. \"  He      joins us from our studios in Washington.      Welcome back to SCIENCE FRIDAY.      Mr. LESTER BROWN (Earth Policy Institute):  Thank you, Ira.      FLATOW:  Doesn't sound very optimistic once again, as you weren't last      time you were here.      Mr. BROWN:  Actually, there are a lot of things we can do to put the      world economy on a sustainable path, but it's not going to be easy.  It's      going to take a lot of restructuring, but we have the technologies needed      to do it.  I mean, as you well know, for decades now, ecologists have      been saying that we need to restructure the world economy in order to      protect the natural support systems, to stabilize climate, to deal with      the sorts of problems that Professor Blaustein was describing a few      minutes ago.  But, unfortunately, there haven't been enough people      convinced of the need to do this.  Now what's happening in China is      beginning to convince economists that we're going to have to make some      changes, big time.      I mean, perhaps the most important contribution of \"Plan B, 2. 0,\" at      least according to the early readers, is the simple calculations on      China.  First of all, China now consumes more of the basic resources than      the US does.  I mean, ever since you and I can remember, we've been      saying that the US, 5 percent of the world's people, consumes a third or      maybe even 40 percent of the world's resources, and that was true for a      long time, but it no longer is.  China now consumes more grain, more      meat, more coal, more steel.  Among the major commodities, the only one      the US still leads in is oil.      But the fact that China has now overtaken us in total consumption of      these basic commodities gives us license to ask the next question, which      is:  What if they catch up to us in consumption per person?  And if the      Chinese economy continues to grow at 8 percent a year, a bit slower than      in recent years, then by 2031 income per person in China will be the same      as in the US today.  And then, if we assume similar consumption patterns,      then we have a real eye opener.  We have a country that will be--have      1. 45 billion people, that will be consuming the equivalent of two-thirds      of the current world grain harvest. Their paper consumption, at US per      capita levels, would be double current world production.  There go the      world's forests.      Or we look at automobiles, for example.  If China one day has three cars      for every four people, as the US does, they will have a fleet of 1. 1      billion cars. The world currently has 800 million cars.  They would have      to pave, for roads, highways, parkings lots, an area comparable to the      area they now plant in rice.  Beyond that, they would consume 99 million      barrels of oil a day.  The world currently produces 84 million barrels a      day and will probably never produce much more than that.      What China is teaching us is that the Western economic model, the      fossil-fuel-based, automobile-centered, throwaway economy, is not going      to work for China.  If it does. . .      FLATOW:  Do they realize this?      Mr. BROWN:  They're beginning to sense it, and I base that partly on      discussions with senior officials in China.  But the--it won't work for      China, nor will it work for India, which, by 2031, will have a population      even larger than that of China.  And it won't work for the other three      billion people in the developing countries who are also dreaming the      American Dream.      And, perhaps most importantly, in a global economy, in an integrated      global economy, where we all depend on the same grain, oil, iron ore,      forest products, etc. , it won't work for us, either.  And that's the      message of the book:  the need to restructure the global economy so that      economic progress can continue.      FLATOW:  And how do you--as an architect of this restructuring, how do      you see it being restructured?      Mr. BROWN:  Well, instead of being fossil-fuel-based, it would be powered      by renewable sources of energy.  Instead of being automobile centered,      transport systems would be much more diverse.  Instead of a throwaway      economy, we would have a comprehensive reuse-recycle economy.  We see      glimpses of this new economy now emerging in various parts of the world.      We see it in the wind farms of western Europe, the solar rooftops of      Japan, the reforested mountains of Korea, the growing fleet of      gas-electric hybrid automobiles in the United States, the      bicycle-friendly streets of Amsterdam in the Netherlands.      So it's beginning to emerge, and perhaps the most exciting single      development now is what's happening with wind energy.  In Europe, wind      farms now supply the electricity needs, the residential electricity      needs, of 40 million Europeans.  By 2020, that's projected to hit 195      million, which will be half of Europe's population.  Europe is, quite      literally, leading the world into the age of wind now.      In this country, we have an enormous supply of wind energy which      could--which is being harnessed, but not fast enough.  Worldwide it's      growing about 30 percent a year; this past year in the US it grew by      about 35 percent.  But it's going to grow even faster, probably, this      year, particularly with some of the major new companies, large      corporations in the business, like GE, which came in two years ago.      Goldman Sachs has now bought a wind company.  It's a subsidiary of      Goldman Sachs, and they have some 5,000 megawatts of wind energy either      under construction or in the planning stage.  I mean, that's equivalent      to, say, 17 typical coal-fired power plants around the country.      So things are beginning to move, but still not fast enough.      FLATOW:  Yeah.  I just was reading about the Whole Foods Company making a      major investment in wind power.  All of their stores will be using      wind-generated electricity.      Mr. BROWN:  Interesting.  It's also interesting that a lot of utilities      and the--a lot of the utilities have been offering their consumers      electricity from renewable sources, most importantly from wind energy,      but charging a premium--5, 10 or 15 percent above the price for their      other sources of electricity.  But that's now beginning to change,      because with natural gas prices going up so fast, the price of      electricity generated from natural gas is now moving above the cost of      wind power.  And so some companies are now trying to lock in long-term      contracts for wind energy, because they know it's going to be one of the      cheapest sources of electricity available in the future.      FLATOW:  But how will wind energy, for example, satisfy China's desire      to, you know, populate the country with automobiles, or at least even      power them, if they desire to do that?      Mr. BROWN:  Let me use the US to illustrate that point, because the US      and China both have enormous amounts of wind energy.  The exciting thing      is that we have advances in technology, in the design of gas-electric      hybrids and in wind turbines, that set the foundation, the technological      foundation, for an entirely new automotive energy economy.  If in this      country, either for reasons of climate stabilization or oil insecurity,      we decided that over the next decade we would shift entirely to      gas-electric hybrids, with an efficiency approaching that of today's      Toyota Prius, we could cut our gasoline use in half.  If. . .      FLATOW:  But isn't that going to take a policy decision, a Jimmy      Carter-like, you know, presidential effort?  Or in China, they--you know,      a political decision in China or in India or these other countries to go      ahead and do those things, to spur them on?      Mr. BROWN:  It probably will take some leadership, but the market is      already beginning to drive some of these processes.  Once we get      gas-electric hybrids, then we have another option, which is to add a      second storage battery and a plug-in capacity.  Then you can plug your      car in at night when you have--while you're sleeping, and we can do our      short-distance driving--the daily commute, grocery shopping, etc. --we can      do that all with electricity.      FLATOW:  1 (800) 989-8255 is our number, talking with Lester Brown,      author of \"Plan B:  Rescuing a Planet Under Stress and a Civilization in      Trouble. \" \"Plan B, 2. 0,\" actually.  It's sober reading, and if you know      Lester Brown's work, like we've been talking about over the years, you      know, it's really interesting reading.      Let's go to the phone.  Let's go to Hugh in Oakland.  Hi, Hugh.      HUGH (Caller):  Hi.  How are you?      FLATOW:  Fine.  Go ahead.      HUGH:  I'm calling--traditionally, in an international agreement, US and      other world leaders, even progressive European leaders, have not wanted      to include the environment as part of international accords.  What has      often happened, as an indirect result of this, is that industries which      have moved to China and might have been regulated here--for example,      textiles and pollution coming out of textile mills, as well as chemical      companies--get moved over to China, where we now buy our products from,      and there's less or no regulation.  And I wanted to find out whether      it's--you know, what the author thinks about whether these--the      environment should not be now included in some of these international      accords.      Mr. BROWN:  Well, the environment is included in some, but not nearly      enough. I mean, the Kyoto protocol was an interesting example of an      agreement that's focused entirely on climate change, which is probably      far and away the number-one environmental issue that we're facing.      But. . .      HUGH:  I guess specifically what I'm talking about is international trade      accords, which affect commerce, not only environmental accords.      Mr. BROWN:  Yes, good point.  There's no question but that some companies      have been moving to China not only because of cheap labor but because of      either lax--either the lack of environmental requirements or lax      enforcement of those requirements.  And what that's now translating into      is an environmental nightmare for the Chinese in terms of both air      pollution and water pollution, and we're probably going to see a lot more      examples of leaks of the sort that developed on the Songhua River in the      north of China back around Thanksgiving time, when a large amount of      benzene was discharged into the river.  And that affected not only the      Chinese downstream, but eventually the Russians, as well, as the river      made its way toward the sea.      FLATOW:  Thank you.  Yeah, we're talking with Lester Brown, author of      \"Plan B, 2. 0:  Rescuing a Planet Under Stress and a Civilization in      Trouble\" on TALK OF THE NATION/SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.      There was news this week--I think it was yesterday that California      announced a new initiative for solar power in the state with the goal      being to make California a world leader in solar power.  We see lots of      other states themselves taking initiatives to try to work on their own      where they feel the federal government is falling behind.  New York      sometimes follows the environmental laws or trying to follow California      with, you know, car regulations for miles per gallon or tailpipe      emissions.  Why is it that California is always in the front of these      things?      Mr. BROWN:  I don't know.  I've often thought about that.  I mean, you      start with Europe and then you come to the East Coast of the United      States, which is much more flexible and sort of cutting edge, and then      you cross the continent to California and then you're really on the      cutting edge.      FLATOW:  Yeah.      Mr. BROWN:  I think it's partly because it's a newer society.  It doesn't      have all the tradition and so forth that's in others.      But one of the most interesting things happening in this country now is      not only these state initiatives that you mentioned--and I think the      California Solar Initiative is an important one--but there are 180      mayors, including mayors of the largest cities in the country like Los      Angeles and New York, who are supporting the Kyoto protocol, who signed      on to support it.  And I find this interesting because it is, in effect,      a grassroots political revolution when mayors around the country of both      parties--this is a bipartisan effort--are taking over responsibilities      that traditionally have belonged in Washington.  In effect, they're      filling the vacuum that exists in Washington now on climate policy.      FLATOW:  But as you say, if China and India are going to swamp the US in      25 years in terms of leadership, isn't it just as important or more      important for these countries to, quote, \"get the message\" and move      toward more energy efficiency and alternative renewable energies      . . . (unintelligible)?      Mr. BROWN:  There's no question about that, and we're beginning to see      some of that in these countries now.  I think the Chinese, with their      serious pollution problems, are beginning to realize that one of the best      investments they can make is in energy efficiency, for example.  They      have been surprisingly lax and uninterested in energy efficiency compared      with, say, the Japanese, which are--a country which is a neighbor.  And      they're beginning to see not only the cost of the energy itself, but the      environmental fallout from using so much energy.      China is now just beginning to mount a major, potentially massive effort      to develop its wind resources, and this I find encouraging.  India's      actually well along with wind.  I think it now ranks maybe fourth or      fifth in the world in its wind-generating capacity, and one of the major      international companies in this field is now an Indian company.      FLATOW:  Mm-hmm.  Well, we're going to have to take a short break and      come right back and talk more with Lester Brown, author of \"Plan B, 2. 0      (pronounced two-dot-zero) or 2. 0 (pronounced two-point-zero)\"-whichever      you wish--\"Rescuing a Planet Under Stress and a Civilization in Trouble. \"      He'll be here to talk with us.      Also, we're going to change gears a little bit.  We'll have Lester Brown      stay with us, and also talk a bit about AIDS in China and HIV infection      spreading rapidly around that country.  So stay with us.  We'll be right      back to take more of your calls after this break.      I'm Ira Flatow.  This is TALK OF THE NATION/SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.      (Announcements)      FLATOW:  You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION/SCIENCE FRIDAY.  I'm Ira      Flatow.      We're talking this hour about China's future and the implications for the      environment with my guest Lester Brown, president and founder of the      Earth Policy Institute.  His new book is called \"Plan B, 2. 0:  Rescuing a      Planet Under Stress and a Civilization in Trouble. \"  Our number:  1 (800)      989-8255.      Lester, you make an interesting point in your book about what might      happen if we shift from fossil fuels to other grain-based fuels like      ethanol.  They would be more pressure to use food for fuel.  We would let      people starve that way.      Mr. BROWN:  One of the consequences of rising auto prices that we've      always worried about is the effect on food production costs, and that's a      legitimate concern for sure.  But what we're also seeing when oil prices      get up to $40 a barrel, or over $60 barrel where they are now, is that it      suddenly becomes very profitable to convert agricultural commodities into      automotive fuel.  We see this with ethanol distilleries, we see it with      biodiesel refineries.  And it's an interesting situation because the      world price of oil will become the support price not only for farm      commodities, but it will also establish the minimum price for food,      because if at any time the fuel value of a commodity is greater than the      food value, it will be converted into fuel.  In effect, we're setting the      stage for competition between supermarkets and service stations.      Up until a few years ago, the only important group of buyers in world      commodity markets were those who were buying for food processors, who      would take the agriculture commodities and convert them into products to      go on supermarket shelves.  Now we have a second group, and this is group      is buying for fuel producers.  We see them in Europe particularly with      biodiesel, in this country with ethanol.  We used 34 million tons of      grain last year, enough to feed a hundred million people, for producing      ethanol.  In Brazil, ethanol production is growing very rapidly--by leaps      and bounds, in fact--because ethanol produced from sugarcane is actually      cheaper than gasoline produced from oil at $60 a barrel.  So we're seeing      a fuzzing of the line between the food economy and the fuel economy, and      dealing with higher food prices, if oil prices stay high, is going to be      one of the big political challenges in the years ahead.      FLATOW:  Mm-hmm.  We're talking this hour about China's future and the      future impact they will have on the rest of the world and implications      for the environment with my guest Lester Brown, author of \"Plan B, 2. 0:      Rescuing a Planet Under Stress and a Civilization in Trouble. \"       IRA FLATOW, host:       From NPR News, you're listening to TALK OF THE NATION/SCIENCE FRIDAY.      I'm Ira Flatow.       And for the rest of this hour, a look at the intersection of economics      and the environment and what it means for our planet.  But first, we're      going to give you a little quiz.  See if you can guess which country I'm      talking about.       It consumes more of the world's grain, steel and meat than any other      country. They mine and burn a quarter of the world's coal.  Six thousand      mine workers were killed in their mines in 2004.  Their military budget      is third behind the US and Russia, and they have plans to put a probe on      the moon in 2007. According to one estimate, about 81 percent--eight out      of 10--toys sold here in the US are made there, and about 80 percent of      all Christmas tree ornaments and decorations sold around the world are      made there.       Well, you probably have it by now.  I'm talking, of course, about China.      And according to my next guest, China's extraordinary economic growth is      going to stretch our already stressed natural systems past the breaking      point.  He says that at current growth rates, by 2031--that's about 25      years from now--China will have an appetite for oil larger than what the      whole world currently produces.       So what does that mean for the rest of us?  My next guests believes that      China is just the tip of the iceberg of a global economy that is      outgrowing the capacity of our Earth to support it, leading to a possible      collapse of our modern way of life.  Lester Brown is the founder and      president of the Earth Policy Institute.  His latest book is \"Plan B,      2. 0:  Rescuing a Planet Under Stress and a Civilization in Trouble. \"  He      joins us from our studios in Washington.       Welcome back to SCIENCE FRIDAY.       Mr. LESTER BROWN (Earth Policy Institute):  Thank you, Ira.       FLATOW:  Doesn't sound very optimistic once again, as you weren't last      time you were here.       Mr. BROWN:  Actually, there are a lot of things we can do to put the      world economy on a sustainable path, but it's not going to be easy.  It's      going to take a lot of restructuring, but we have the technologies needed      to do it.  I mean, as you well know, for decades now, ecologists have      been saying that we need to restructure the world economy in order to      protect the natural support systems, to stabilize climate, to deal with      the sorts of problems that Professor Blaustein was describing a few      minutes ago.  But, unfortunately, there haven't been enough people      convinced of the need to do this.  Now what's happening in China is      beginning to convince economists that we're going to have to make some      changes, big time.       I mean, perhaps the most important contribution of \"Plan B, 2. 0,\" at      least according to the early readers, is the simple calculations on      China.  First of all, China now consumes more of the basic resources than      the US does.  I mean, ever since you and I can remember, we've been      saying that the US, 5 percent of the world's people, consumes a third or      maybe even 40 percent of the world's resources, and that was true for a      long time, but it no longer is.  China now consumes more grain, more      meat, more coal, more steel.  Among the major commodities, the only one      the US still leads in is oil.       But the fact that China has now overtaken us in total consumption of      these basic commodities gives us license to ask the next question, which      is:  What if they catch up to us in consumption per person?  And if the      Chinese economy continues to grow at 8 percent a year, a bit slower than      in recent years, then by 2031 income per person in China will be the same      as in the US today.  And then, if we assume similar consumption patterns,      then we have a real eye opener.  We have a country that will be--have      1. 45 billion people, that will be consuming the equivalent of two-thirds      of the current world grain harvest. Their paper consumption, at US per      capita levels, would be double current world production.  There go the      world's forests.       Or we look at automobiles, for example.  If China one day has three cars      for every four people, as the US does, they will have a fleet of 1. 1      billion cars. The world currently has 800 million cars.  They would have      to pave, for roads, highways, parkings lots, an area comparable to the      area they now plant in rice.  Beyond that, they would consume 99 million      barrels of oil a day.  The world currently produces 84 million barrels a      day and will probably never produce much more than that.       What China is teaching us is that the Western economic model, the      fossil-fuel-based, automobile-centered, throwaway economy, is not going      to work for China.  If it does. . .       FLATOW:  Do they realize this?       Mr. BROWN:  They're beginning to sense it, and I base that partly on      discussions with senior officials in China.  But the--it won't work for      China, nor will it work for India, which, by 2031, will have a population      even larger than that of China.  And it won't work for the other three      billion people in the developing countries who are also dreaming the      American Dream.       And, perhaps most importantly, in a global economy, in an integrated      global economy, where we all depend on the same grain, oil, iron ore,      forest products, etc. , it won't work for us, either.  And that's the      message of the book:  the need to restructure the global economy so that      economic progress can continue.       FLATOW:  And how do you--as an architect of this restructuring, how do      you see it being restructured?       Mr. BROWN:  Well, instead of being fossil-fuel-based, it would be powered      by renewable sources of energy.  Instead of being automobile centered,      transport systems would be much more diverse.  Instead of a throwaway      economy, we would have a comprehensive reuse-recycle economy.  We see      glimpses of this new economy now emerging in various parts of the world.      We see it in the wind farms of western Europe, the solar rooftops of      Japan, the reforested mountains of Korea, the growing fleet of      gas-electric hybrid automobiles in the United States, the      bicycle-friendly streets of Amsterdam in the Netherlands.       So it's beginning to emerge, and perhaps the most exciting single      development now is what's happening with wind energy.  In Europe, wind      farms now supply the electricity needs, the residential electricity      needs, of 40 million Europeans.  By 2020, that's projected to hit 195      million, which will be half of Europe's population.  Europe is, quite      literally, leading the world into the age of wind now.       In this country, we have an enormous supply of wind energy which      could--which is being harnessed, but not fast enough.  Worldwide it's      growing about 30 percent a year; this past year in the US it grew by      about 35 percent.  But it's going to grow even faster, probably, this      year, particularly with some of the major new companies, large      corporations in the business, like GE, which came in two years ago.      Goldman Sachs has now bought a wind company.  It's a subsidiary of      Goldman Sachs, and they have some 5,000 megawatts of wind energy either      under construction or in the planning stage.  I mean, that's equivalent      to, say, 17 typical coal-fired power plants around the country.       So things are beginning to move, but still not fast enough.       FLATOW:  Yeah.  I just was reading about the Whole Foods Company making a      major investment in wind power.  All of their stores will be using      wind-generated electricity.       Mr. BROWN:  Interesting.  It's also interesting that a lot of utilities      and the--a lot of the utilities have been offering their consumers      electricity from renewable sources, most importantly from wind energy,      but charging a premium--5, 10 or 15 percent above the price for their      other sources of electricity.  But that's now beginning to change,      because with natural gas prices going up so fast, the price of      electricity generated from natural gas is now moving above the cost of      wind power.  And so some companies are now trying to lock in long-term      contracts for wind energy, because they know it's going to be one of the      cheapest sources of electricity available in the future.       FLATOW:  But how will wind energy, for example, satisfy China's desire      to, you know, populate the country with automobiles, or at least even      power them, if they desire to do that?       Mr. BROWN:  Let me use the US to illustrate that point, because the US      and China both have enormous amounts of wind energy.  The exciting thing      is that we have advances in technology, in the design of gas-electric      hybrids and in wind turbines, that set the foundation, the technological      foundation, for an entirely new automotive energy economy.  If in this      country, either for reasons of climate stabilization or oil insecurity,      we decided that over the next decade we would shift entirely to      gas-electric hybrids, with an efficiency approaching that of today's      Toyota Prius, we could cut our gasoline use in half.  If. . .       FLATOW:  But isn't that going to take a policy decision, a Jimmy      Carter-like, you know, presidential effort?  Or in China, they--you know,      a political decision in China or in India or these other countries to go      ahead and do those things, to spur them on?       Mr. BROWN:  It probably will take some leadership, but the market is      already beginning to drive some of these processes.  Once we get      gas-electric hybrids, then we have another option, which is to add a      second storage battery and a plug-in capacity.  Then you can plug your      car in at night when you have--while you're sleeping, and we can do our      short-distance driving--the daily commute, grocery shopping, etc. --we can      do that all with electricity.       FLATOW:  1 (800) 989-8255 is our number, talking with Lester Brown,      author of \"Plan B:  Rescuing a Planet Under Stress and a Civilization in      Trouble. \" \"Plan B, 2. 0,\" actually.  It's sober reading, and if you know      Lester Brown's work, like we've been talking about over the years, you      know, it's really interesting reading.       Let's go to the phone.  Let's go to Hugh in Oakland.  Hi, Hugh.       HUGH (Caller):  Hi.  How are you?       FLATOW:  Fine.  Go ahead.       HUGH:  I'm calling--traditionally, in an international agreement, US and      other world leaders, even progressive European leaders, have not wanted      to include the environment as part of international accords.  What has      often happened, as an indirect result of this, is that industries which      have moved to China and might have been regulated here--for example,      textiles and pollution coming out of textile mills, as well as chemical      companies--get moved over to China, where we now buy our products from,      and there's less or no regulation.  And I wanted to find out whether      it's--you know, what the author thinks about whether these--the      environment should not be now included in some of these international      accords.       Mr. BROWN:  Well, the environment is included in some, but not nearly      enough. I mean, the Kyoto protocol was an interesting example of an      agreement that's focused entirely on climate change, which is probably      far and away the number-one environmental issue that we're facing.      But. . .       HUGH:  I guess specifically what I'm talking about is international trade      accords, which affect commerce, not only environmental accords.       Mr. BROWN:  Yes, good point.  There's no question but that some companies      have been moving to China not only because of cheap labor but because of      either lax--either the lack of environmental requirements or lax      enforcement of those requirements.  And what that's now translating into      is an environmental nightmare for the Chinese in terms of both air      pollution and water pollution, and we're probably going to see a lot more      examples of leaks of the sort that developed on the Songhua River in the      north of China back around Thanksgiving time, when a large amount of      benzene was discharged into the river.  And that affected not only the      Chinese downstream, but eventually the Russians, as well, as the river      made its way toward the sea.       FLATOW:  Thank you.  Yeah, we're talking with Lester Brown, author of      \"Plan B, 2. 0:  Rescuing a Planet Under Stress and a Civilization in      Trouble\" on TALK OF THE NATION/SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.       There was news this week--I think it was yesterday that California      announced a new initiative for solar power in the state with the goal      being to make California a world leader in solar power.  We see lots of      other states themselves taking initiatives to try to work on their own      where they feel the federal government is falling behind.  New York      sometimes follows the environmental laws or trying to follow California      with, you know, car regulations for miles per gallon or tailpipe      emissions.  Why is it that California is always in the front of these      things?       Mr. BROWN:  I don't know.  I've often thought about that.  I mean, you      start with Europe and then you come to the East Coast of the United      States, which is much more flexible and sort of cutting edge, and then      you cross the continent to California and then you're really on the      cutting edge.       FLATOW:  Yeah.       Mr. BROWN:  I think it's partly because it's a newer society.  It doesn't      have all the tradition and so forth that's in others.       But one of the most interesting things happening in this country now is      not only these state initiatives that you mentioned--and I think the      California Solar Initiative is an important one--but there are 180      mayors, including mayors of the largest cities in the country like Los      Angeles and New York, who are supporting the Kyoto protocol, who signed      on to support it.  And I find this interesting because it is, in effect,      a grassroots political revolution when mayors around the country of both      parties--this is a bipartisan effort--are taking over responsibilities      that traditionally have belonged in Washington.  In effect, they're      filling the vacuum that exists in Washington now on climate policy.       FLATOW:  But as you say, if China and India are going to swamp the US in      25 years in terms of leadership, isn't it just as important or more      important for these countries to, quote, \"get the message\" and move      toward more energy efficiency and alternative renewable energies      . . . (unintelligible)?       Mr. BROWN:  There's no question about that, and we're beginning to see      some of that in these countries now.  I think the Chinese, with their      serious pollution problems, are beginning to realize that one of the best      investments they can make is in energy efficiency, for example.  They      have been surprisingly lax and uninterested in energy efficiency compared      with, say, the Japanese, which are--a country which is a neighbor.  And      they're beginning to see not only the cost of the energy itself, but the      environmental fallout from using so much energy.       China is now just beginning to mount a major, potentially massive effort      to develop its wind resources, and this I find encouraging.  India's      actually well along with wind.  I think it now ranks maybe fourth or      fifth in the world in its wind-generating capacity, and one of the major      international companies in this field is now an Indian company.       FLATOW:  Mm-hmm.  Well, we're going to have to take a short break and      come right back and talk more with Lester Brown, author of \"Plan B, 2. 0      (pronounced two-dot-zero) or 2. 0 (pronounced two-point-zero)\"-whichever      you wish--\"Rescuing a Planet Under Stress and a Civilization in Trouble. \"      He'll be here to talk with us.       Also, we're going to change gears a little bit.  We'll have Lester Brown      stay with us, and also talk a bit about AIDS in China and HIV infection      spreading rapidly around that country.  So stay with us.  We'll be right      back to take more of your calls after this break.       I'm Ira Flatow.  This is TALK OF THE NATION/SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.       (Announcements)       FLATOW:  You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION/SCIENCE FRIDAY.  I'm Ira      Flatow.       We're talking this hour about China's future and the implications for the      environment with my guest Lester Brown, president and founder of the      Earth Policy Institute.  His new book is called \"Plan B, 2. 0:  Rescuing a      Planet Under Stress and a Civilization in Trouble. \"  Our number:  1 (800)      989-8255.       Lester, you make an interesting point in your book about what might      happen if we shift from fossil fuels to other grain-based fuels like      ethanol.  They would be more pressure to use food for fuel.  We would let      people starve that way.       Mr. BROWN:  One of the consequences of rising auto prices that we've      always worried about is the effect on food production costs, and that's a      legitimate concern for sure.  But what we're also seeing when oil prices      get up to $40 a barrel, or over $60 barrel where they are now, is that it      suddenly becomes very profitable to convert agricultural commodities into      automotive fuel.  We see this with ethanol distilleries, we see it with      biodiesel refineries.  And it's an interesting situation because the      world price of oil will become the support price not only for farm      commodities, but it will also establish the minimum price for food,      because if at any time the fuel value of a commodity is greater than the      food value, it will be converted into fuel.  In effect, we're setting the      stage for competition between supermarkets and service stations.       Up until a few years ago, the only important group of buyers in world      commodity markets were those who were buying for food processors, who      would take the agriculture commodities and convert them into products to      go on supermarket shelves.  Now we have a second group, and this is group      is buying for fuel producers.  We see them in Europe particularly with      biodiesel, in this country with ethanol.  We used 34 million tons of      grain last year, enough to feed a hundred million people, for producing      ethanol.  In Brazil, ethanol production is growing very rapidly--by leaps      and bounds, in fact--because ethanol produced from sugarcane is actually      cheaper than gasoline produced from oil at $60 a barrel.  So we're seeing      a fuzzing of the line between the food economy and the fuel economy, and      dealing with higher food prices, if oil prices stay high, is going to be      one of the big political challenges in the years ahead.

I am Ira Flatow.      Ever since I was 12 when my seventh-grade term paper was a paper on      Benjamin Franklin I've always been very interested in the history of Ben      Franklin, and next Tuesday marks the 300th birthday of the printer,      postmaster, diplomat, statesman, inventor--you could go on forever with      this list, and for the rest of the hour we're going to be looking back on      the life and times of Franklin. And if you want to talk about Ben, give      us a call.  Our number, 1 (800) 989-8255; 1 (800) 989-TALK.  And as      always, you can surf over to our Web site at sciencefriday. com.      Let me introduce my guests.  H. W. Brands is the Dickson Allen Anderson      Centennial Professor in the Department of History at the University of      Texas in Austin.  He's the author of \"The First American:  The Life and      Times of Benjamin Franklin. \"  He joins us from the studios of KUT in      Austin.      Welcome to the program.      Dr. H. W. BRANDS (Author, \"The First American\"):  Hi, Ira.      FLATOW:  Let me congratulate your team again, if no one else has.      Dr. BRANDS:  Well, a couple of people have, but thank you very much.      We'll accept the congratulations anyway they come.      FLATOW:  In that Rose Bowl.  Page Talbott is the associate director and      chief curator of the Benjamin Franklin Tercentenary, a major exhibit      that's now going on in Philadelphia before it moves around the country      later this year. She's also editor and author of \"Benjamin Franklin:  In      Search of a Better World,\" published this year by Yale University Press.      She joins us from the studios of member station WHYY in Philadelphia.      Welcome to the program.      Ms. PAGE TALBOTT (Author, \"Benjamin Franklin\"):  Good afternoon.      FLATOW:  Good afternoon to you.  Page, exciting time to be in      Philadelphia, I would imagine, when you're talking about Ben Franklin.      Ms. TALBOTT:  It's all Ben all the time.  We're very excited.      FLATOW:  (Laughs) Is it really?  Is he really--for the last 300 years?      Ms. TALBOTT:  Well, you know what?  He really never has left.  He's been      popular for a lot of reasons for a long time.  But this year is sure a      big opportunity for us to revisit Franklin the man and to just look at      his vast numbers of accomplishments.      FLATOW:  What kinds of things would we see at the exhibit if we were to      visit Philadelphia?      Ms. TALBOTT:  Well, we have an 8,000-square-foot exhibition that focuses      on Franklin's entire life, and you'd see a wide range of artifacts      ranging from the first almanac published in 1833 to his own copy of the      US Constitution to his shaving mug--his shaving bowl, I should say--to      his own electrical battery and electrostatic machine, as well as 40      different interactives that explain the nature of his printing and his      experiments on board ship charting the Gulf Stream.      FLATOW:  Right.  Bill Brands, your book calls Franklin the first      American. Why that terminology?      Dr. BRANDS:  Well, for a couple of reasons.  One is, I think, in terms of      chronology, Franklin was the first to embrace an American identity at a      time when most of the other people we've come to call the Founding      Fathers were still thinking of themselves as Englishmen.  As early as the      beginning of 1774, Franklin was brought before the British Privy Council      and, in a rather embarrassing ordeal, was essentially made to answer for      what the British government considered to be the sins of the American      Colonists.  And as I read Franklin, at that point, he came to realize      that he and his fellow Americans would have to embrace their American      identity because the English would never allow them to be full-blown      Englishmen.      Now there's another reason I call him the first American, and that is      that he was, in his day, the pre-eminent--he was the most famous      American.  At a time when no one outside the American Colonies ever heard      of George Washington or Thomas Jefferson or John Adams, people all over      Europe had heard of Benjamin Franklin.  He really was the most famous      person of his generation.  He was first in that regard.      FLATOW:  Mm-hmm.  And let me ask both of you, beginning with Page, though      he did have a--not everything was totally positive, was it?      Ms. TALBOTT:  Well, Franklin was a human being, first and foremost, and      so I think it's really important to recognize the fact that he had warts      like the rest of us.  He was a person who had a difficult family      relationship in many ways with his older son, and he did not live with      his wife for some 27 years. He also was a slaveholder early in his life,      although at the end of his life he was very much of an abolitionist.  So      his is a complex personality, and I think we learn from his      extraordinariness, but we also learn from his foibles.      FLATOW:  Another way to look at, Bill Brands, as the first American.  He      had all kinds of complex properties.      Dr. BRANDS:  Well, he certainly inspired envy in some of his      contemporaries. And one of the intriguing things for me as a biographer      is to figure out how much of the envy he actually earned and how much of      it was just a projection of the emotions of other people.  His      relationship with John Adams was famously difficult, and Adams was one      who was convinced that Franklin was getting far too much credit for the      American Revolution, for everything else that was going on in his times.      And if you look at it from Adams' point of view, it sort of makes sense.      If you look at it from Franklin's point of view, it's easy to see that      Adams was getting excessively worked up over rather minor things.      FLATOW:  Mm-hmm.  One other. . .      Ms. TALBOTT:  It's a wonderful comparison, Ira.  I'm really glad that Dr.      Brands brought this up because the difference between Adams and Franklin      sort of represents the difference between Boston and Philadelphia, in      some ways. Adams really did feel that Franklin was much too French when      he was over in France.  And I think that it was because he was so French      when he was over in France that he was so successful in his dealings      there.      FLATOW:  Yeah, bringing help for the Revolution.      Ms. TALBOTT:  Right.      FLATOW:  And one of the reasons he was so successful there was because of      his famous kite-flying experiment, which was actually done in France      before it was done here, wasn't it?      Ms. TALBOTT:  Well, certainly, there were experiments in relation to it.      There was a experiment that Dalibard did with a sentry box there. . .      FLATOW:  Right.      Ms. TALBOTT:  . . . and it was almost simultaneous with what was going on      back here.  But one of the reasons that Franklin was so famous, and      being--the singular reason that he was most famous abroad was because of      his experiments and his correspondence was vast going back and forth from      America to Europe.      Dr. BRANDS:  And it was precisely for that reason that Franklin was named      to head the diplomatic mission to Paris.  It was supposed to get--the      French alliance was going to make American victory in the War for      Independence possible, because the Continental Congress could have sent      John Adams over and no one would know who he was.  In fact, when Adams      finally got there, he kept being confused with Samuel Adams and he was      simply known around Paris as `the other Adams' at a time when everybody      in France who paid any attention to world affairs or philosophy or      science knew of Benjamin Franklin.  When Franklin arrived in Paris at the      end of 1776, it was--well, the best I can come up with, it was pretty      much like when The Beatles arrived in New York in 1964.  He was--you      could almost liken him to the rock star of his day.  In fact, his image      was all over Paris.  He remarked, only half jestingly, to a friend that      he was more famous in Paris than the man in the moon.      FLATOW:  Hmm.  1 (800) 989-8255.  Lisa in Cleveland, hi.  Welcome to      SCIENCE FRIDAY.      LISA (Caller):  Hi, thanks for taking my call.      FLATOW:  Excuse my cold today, if you will.      LISA:  I was wondering what other inventions is Ben Franklin famous for,      and how did he do this experiment without hurting himself?  I'll hang up.      FLATOW:  OK.  How did he. . .      Ms. TALBOTT:  I can sort of list some of those. . .      FLATOW:  Yes, sure.      Ms. TALBOTT:  . . . inventions, and Bill can join in.  He invented the swim      fins, the bifocals.  He invented the battery.  He invented the      Pennsylvanian stove, which we know as the Franklin stove.  He was the man      who first charted the Gulf Stream, and he applied a previous technology      to coming up with his own version of an odometer for measuring the      distance between post offices.      Dr. BRANDS:  He also invented, or certainly made popular, the lightning      rod, which many people in his day considered to be the most practical,      the most cost-effective invention he'd come up with because it saved      hundreds, perhaps thousands over time, of buildings from destruction.      FLATOW:  Did he not also study ants and invented the harmonia(ph), if I      remember.  I'm going back to, like, seventh grade here.      Dr. BRANDS:  Right, right.      Ms. TALBOTT:  That's right.  Well, he invented the armonica, which is a      wonderful instrument.  I mean, it sort of depends on your fancy.  Do you      like how it sounds, Ira?      FLATOW:  You know, I'm not sure I've ever heard it.      Ms. TALBOTT:  Oh, it's really beautiful.  Come see our show and you'll      get to hear it played there.  It's based on the principle of people      playing music on their wine glasses or water glasses.      FLATOW:  Right, I've seen pictures of it.      Ms. TALBOTT:  Right.      FLATOW:  You have to wet the glass and. . .      Ms. TALBOTT:  You have graduated bowls that are mounted on a metal rod. . .      FLATOW:  Right.      Ms. TALBOTT:  . . . and then you use a treadle to pump it and then you use      your finger dipped in water to play it.  And it's really quite wonderful.      However, there was a problem with it, and that is that the chamber that      housed the glasses was lead and the glass was lead.  And so there      are--some say that people got lead poisoning from playing it.  But      today's versions are not leaded, and they're really quite wonderful.      Dr. BRANDS:  Well, the caller asked. . .      FLATOW:  And to answer. . .      Dr. BRANDS:  I'm sorry, the caller asked how Franklin. . .      FLATOW:  No, I was going to bring that up.  No, go ahead.  I'm sorry.      Dr. BRANDS:  OK.  Yeah--how it was that Franklin didn't kill himself if      his experiments, because these really do fall in the category of `Don't      try this at home. '  And as a matter of fact, Franklin nearly did kill      himself once.  He electrocuted himself in his laboratory.  He was      stunned, he was knocked unconscious briefly and he woke up.  And when he      did wake up, he was able to write down what it felt like and what the      reaction was.  And, in fact, somebody else who tried his kite experiment      was killed.  So it's a. . .      FLATOW:  It was a Russian, right?      Dr. BRANDS:  Yeah, I can't remember the nationality. . .      FLATOW:  Yeah, it was a Russian.      Dr. BRANDS:  . . . but it did take place in Europe, and the unfortunate      experimenter was killed.  So Franklin was pretty convinced that this      stuff up in the sky, lightning, was the same kind of electricity that he      was working with in his laboratory, but even he had no idea how powerful      that stuff was.      FLATOW:  Mm-hmm.  1 (800) 989-8255.  Jim in Spencer, Iowa.  Hi, Jim.      JIM (Caller):  I was curious to know where Ben Franklin got his      resources? Was he, you know, wealthy to begin with, or did he acquire      these, you know, resources on his own?      FLATOW:  A good question.      Ms. TALBOTT:  Franklin. . .      Dr. BRANDS:  Well, Franklin was. . .      Ms. TALBOTT:  Go ahead.      Dr. BRANDS:  Go ahead, Page.      Ms. TALBOTT:  No.      Dr. BRANDS:  OK.  Well, what I was going to say was that Benjamin      Franklin is often cited as the prototype of the American capitalist, and      to some degree he was.  He was a self-made man.  He arrived in      Philadelphia with a couple of dollars in his pocket and went from there      to become not inordinately wealthy, but comfortably wealthy.      But unlike a lot of capitalists, Franklin always believed that whatever      he made was simply to provide him the opportunity to do things that he      really wanted to do.  So he retired from the active practice of his      printing business at the age of 42 to devote himself to what he called      his philosophical research, namely his science experiments.  And for the      rest of his life, he was a silent partner in the printing business, but      he never had to work himself for a living after that.  And so he was able      to fund his own research.      Now I happen to think it was one of the aspects of Franklin's genius to      identify a field of scientific research where, with a relatively modest      outlay of funds and with a relatively short amount of time bringing      himself up to speed, he could make original contributions.  Electricity,      the field of electricity, was in that kind of nascent stage at that time.      If he had tried to study biology or aspects of chemistry, he might not      have been anywhere near so successful.  But the fact of the matter was he      could see where--with a fairly brief amount of time and with the      resources he had at hand--he could purchase or develop the equipment that      he needed, he could bring himself into familiarity with the research of      other people and make a contribution, as he did within just a few years      of starting his researches.      FLATOW:  Page, if you want to add something to--just. . .      Ms. TALBOTT:  Just that he's sort of the first franchise man.  He used      the power of horizontal integration. . .      FLATOW:  Yeah.      Ms. TALBOTT:  . . . and, as Bill was saying, that he was the silent partner,      and so he did receive income from these other printers with--for whom he      provided funds to help set them up in business.      FLATOW:  And he helped start the first post office, did he not?      Ms. TALBOTT:  Well, he was an early post person here in America.  He was      deputy postmaster, and that was a very important vehicle for helping him      get his word out by way of delivering the Pennsylvania Gazette up and      down the Eastern seaboard, all the way--from South Carolina all the way      up to Massachusetts.  And because he had control over the post office, he      had control over distribution.      FLATOW:  Mm-hmm.  We're talking about. . .      Dr. BRANDS:  And just about. . .      FLATOW:  Let me just jump in and do a. . .      Dr. BRANDS:  I'm sorry.      FLATOW:  . . . take care of some business so we can all. . .      Dr. BRANDS:  All right.      FLATOW:  . . . keep the lights on.      Dr. BRANDS:  Sure.      FLATOW:  We're talking about Ben Franklin this hour on TALK OF THE NATION      SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.  Talking with Alan Stern of Southwest      Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado, and Page--I'm sorry H. W.      Brands--reading the wrong part of the paper--H. W. Brands, the Dickson      Allen Anderson Centennial professor, Department of History, University of      Texas in Austin, author of \"The First American:  The Life and Times of      Benjamin Franklin\" and Page Talbott, associate director and chief curator      of the Ben Franklin Tercentenary.  How come we don't just call it a      tricentennial?      Ms. TALBOTT:  Or Ben Franklin 300, how about that?      FLATOW:  After it leaves Philadelphia, how--well, first of all, how long      is it going to be in Philly and where does it go from there?      Ms. TALBOTT:  It's going to be in Philadelphia until April 30th and then      it travels to St. Louis and then Houston, Denver, Atlanta and finally to      Paris.      FLATOW:  All right.      Ms. TALBOTT:  And it closes in 2008.      FLATOW:  2008, so, it's--well, of course, it would have to go to Paris,      one would think.      Ms. TALBOTT:  Of course, it would.      FLATOW:  Of Ben Franklin--can you actually find anything new that hasn't      been written or talked about about Ben Franklin?  Is there more to be      discovered or do you just try to turn the embers over a little bit?      Ms. TALBOTT:  In the course of this project we've been able to learn a      great deal about the material culture of Benjamin Franklin.  In other      words, what he had at home because since this is a exhibition we wanted      to acquire artifacts that related to his life.      FLATOW:  Right.      Ms. TALBOTT:  And so we have his buttons and his sword and his library      chair and so forth.  And my own particular interest is in Ben Franklin      and his domestic life.  And so, for the first time, we've really be able      to get at something that people don't know about Franklin and that is      that he loved to shop.      FLATOW:  No kidding?      Ms. TALBOTT:  Yup.      FLATOW:  He didn't invent the first mall, did he?      Ms. TALBOTT:  Well, you know what?  He would have loved the mall.  He      sent home from England a piece of pottery from every pottery manufactory      in England just because he thought it was so cool.      FLATOW:  OK.      Prof.  BRANDS:  I'll second what Page said regarding what we can find,      what we uncovered these days about Franklin.  In London the Benjamin--the      house where Franklin lived in Craven Street for about 18 years has just      has been--well, I think it's just opening maybe this month after a      considerable refurbishing.      Ms. TALBOTT:  On the birthday, in fact.      Prof. BRANDS:  Right.  OK, and to visit that house is to get a sense of      the--call it the domestic universe that Franklin inhabited.  Houses were      different in those days.  Here was one of the great men of the British      Empire and he was living in a house that would be considered just tiny by      modern standards.  And there's another reason we look at Franklin and      that is even if we don't unearth new information, the questions that we      have of Benjamin Franklin are different than the questions that previous      generations had.  And so people are more willing, or maybe they consider      it much more necessary to examine the domestic life of Franklin to see      how it was that he got along with his illegitimate son, William, and how      William got along with his illegitimate son, William Temple.  The whole      domestic side of the Franklin story takes--plays a larger role, I think,      in biographies these days than it might have 40, 50 years ago.      FLATOW:  Would he have considered himself, by today's standards, just an      ordinary guy?      Prof. BRANDS:  Oh, no.  Franklin didn't consider himself ordinary at all,      although he often had to down--Franklin recognized that he was one of the      geniuses of his time.  But he also realized that if he made too much of      that he wouldn't get very far.  I think this has a lot to do with the      fact that he was one of the very youngest of a very large family.  And as      bright as he was, with a dozen older siblings, you know, they weren't      going to cut him any slack just because he was smart.  In fact, if      anything they would probably beat him up because he was too smart.  So      Franklin learned fairly early on that he could accomplish a lot if he      didn't insist on accomplishing it in the name and for the fame of      Benjamin Franklin.      FLATOW:  Hmm.      Ms. TALBOTT:  So he spoke with a lot of different voices under a lot of      different pseudonyms and he gave other people the credit. . .      FLATOW:  Mm-hmm.  All right, we're going. . .      Ms. TALBOTT:  . . . which was a very savvy way of going about things.      FLATOW:  Yeah, very diplomatic.  You can see diplomacy coming out there      very early.  So hang on there.  We're going to have to take a short break      and come back but we'll talk lots more about Ben Franklin with Page      Talbott and Bill Brands and take your calls.  So stay with us.  We'll      take a short break. Don't go away, we'll be right back.      I'm Ira Flatow.  This is TALK OF THE NATION SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.      (Announcements)      (Soundbite of music)      FLATOW:  You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION SCIENCE FRIDAY.  I am Ira      Flatow.      We're talking this hour about Ben Franklin with my guests Page Talbott,      author of \"Benjamin Franklin:  In Search of a Better World\" published by      Yale University Press, and Bill Brands who is author of \"The First      American:  The Life and Times of Benjamin Franklin. \"      Our number, 1 (800) 989-8255.  Let's go to Pete in Little Rock.  Hi,      Pete.      PETE (Caller):  Hello.      FLATOW:  Hi there.      PETE:  Thanks for the opportunity.  I've been struck by the fact that      historians rely heavily on written correspondence of figures like Ben      Franklin and I was wondering if you guys have a comment about the modern      world and the fact that we all use e-mail and it all gets deleted and      what are future historians are going to be using to do the same kind or      research?      FLATOW:  Interesting question.  Page, any. . .      Prof. BRANDS:  That's a really good. . .      Ms. TALBOTT:  Go ahead, I'd love to hear your answer.      Prof.  BRANDS:  Sure, it's a really good question.  It's already a      problem when we get to the 20th century even before e-mail because public      figures starting with, well, Franklin Roosevelt, but since I live in      Austin I've done some research on Lyndon Johnson.  If you go to the      Johnson library in Austin, it's nearly impossible to find traces--written      traces of Lyndon Johnson because he simply didn't write stuff down.  Now      for the longest time, it was impossible to figure out what Johnson was      thinking, what Johnson was doing. Only in the last, well, several years      now the library has released tape recordings of Johnson's telephone      calls.  Johnson did his political business by telephone and it just so      happens that the White House, with Johnson's approval, recorded a lot of      this stuff.  But now that people are using e-mail and to the extent that      e-mail gets erased, I really don't know what we're going to rely on.      However, I happen to think--I do know that presidents, for example, and      famous people tend to keep records of things.  Now--but that brings up an      important point.  We can write history about famous people because famous      people either keep their own correspondence or other people who receive      the correspondence keep the correspondence of the famous people.      With Benjamin Franklin, though, I'll tell you it's really difficult to      write much of substance about the first 30 years of Franklin's life.  He      wasn't yet famous and so nobody kept records about Benjamin Franklin.  We      have to rely on his own autobiography.  Once he becomes famous, then      people keep his letters and we can track him.  It's going to be a real      problem when we're trying to write the history of the beginning of the      21st century and I don't know exactly how we're going to solve it.      PETE:  Yeah.  I'd like to make a follow-up comment.  I was just going to      say that like Ken Burns' \"Civil War\" that was a historical even that was      completely dependent on letters.      FLATOW:  But he also had photographs, you know.  I'm also reminded--of      one historian was telling, you know, when you take digital pictures in      cameras now you don't have the extra photos we used to take home from the      drugstore.  We'd keep them lying around.  Now you just erase everything      from the camera.      PETE:  Yeah.      FLATOW:  And they might be an interesting historical record, too.      Thank--good call, Pete, thanks for calling.      PETE:  Thank you.      Prof. BRANDS:  For my part, one of the things I tell my students is if      they want to become immortal, all they have to do is keep a diary.  And I      tell them to keep a written diary and keep it relatively faithfully, but      just make sure that when they die they turn it over to the local      historical society because if they do, then they will be immortal in the      sense that historians 100 years from now, 200 years from now who are      wanting to write the history of daily life of our times will turn to      those sorts of sources because they're going to be so rare.      FLATOW:  Really interesting.  1 (800) 989-8255.  Would it fair--you know,      Americans have the reputation of good old Yankee ingenuity and America      being a country of tinkerers.  Would it be fair to say that started with      Franklin, that reputation and that idea that he was a tinkerer, that then      permeated later on?      Ms. TALBOTT:  One of the things that I liked about Franklin the most is      his great curiosity and also his desire to find simple solutions to      things.  So I think that the answer to your question would be he's      certainly the most famous of the early founding fathers to adopt the idea      of tinkerer.  You know, people associate him with these really wonderful      inventions, particularly the lightening rod.  But most of all he was not      interested in science for science sake as, you know, a pure scientist.      He really was just infinitely interested in everything around him.  He      received--he purchased a microscope in 1750 and he describes what he saw      with words that are almost poetic.  He describes the beauty and the      delicacy and the frailty of the little pieces of moss that he's looking      at.  And I just get the sense that he was somebody who had his--this      wonderful sense of wonder. . .      FLATOW: Yeah.      Ms. TALBOTT:  . . . that went on to becoming something that helped him      improve the world around him.      FLATOW:  Mm-hmm.      Prof. BRANDS:  When I read Frank. . .      FLATOW:  Well. . .      Prof. BRANDS:  Excuse me.  When I read Franklin and his assessment of the      world around him, I'm struck that there seemed to be two influences that      come together.  One is that very practical, you call it the Yankee      inventor, innovator who wants to see how to make peoples' lives better.      His Philadelphia--the Pennsylvania fireplace, for example, is a good      example of this.      But at the same time, just as Page says, there is this almost child-like      wonder that he manages to retain until he's 80 years old.  And every time      he sees something new he wants to know what causes, what makes it work,      what it all means.  It's a remarkable combination that's not commonly      found.      FLATOW:  Of course, one of his contemporaries was sort of a tinkerer.      I'm talking about Thomas Jefferson.  If you go to Monticello, you look at      his home and you see all these things that he's built in his home.  Was      there any--did they talk to each other?  Did they have any sort of, you      know, discussions about scientific knowledge or nature that we know of?      Ms. TALBOTT:  Don't forget that Jefferson was much younger than Franklin.      I mean, there are a lot of common denominators between them, but      Franklin was more than a full generation older than Jefferson.      Prof. BRANDS:  And I think that's one of the reasons that Jefferson got      along much better with Franklin than John Adams did.  Adams was several      years--many years younger than Franklin but he was close enough that      he--at least as I read it--he seemed to feel competitive with Franklin.      Jefferson doesn't seem that way at all.  Jefferson, in fact, famously      after he was named American ambassador in Paris after Franklin left, he      was often introduced around as the person who replaced Benjamin Franklin.      He would say, `No one can replace Dr. Franklin.  I'm merely his      successor. '      FLATOW:  But you don't know if he had any correspondence or any, you      know, scientific. . .      Ms. TALBOTT:  There's not much in the correspondence. . .      FLATOW:  . . . head-to-head or toe-to-toe.      Ms. TALBOTT:  . . . between them.  They overlapped politically but clearly      they were both interested in practical solutions to things.      FLATOW:  Yeah.      Ms. TALBOTT:  And they were both involved in the construction of their      houses and in coming up with useful articles for daily living.      FLATOW:  And, of course, in those days Philadelphia was not, you know,      was not that close to Virginia.  It was. . .      Ms. TALBOTT:  Right, right.      FLATOW:  . . . some sort of a ride to get there.  The metro--never mind.  1      (800) 989-8255.  Kim in East Lansing.  Hi, Kim.      KIM (Caller):  Hi, I wish you guys could have a spot of camomile with me.      I have two quick questions.  I just want to, well, thank SCIENCE FRIDAY      and ask callers to speak more quickly so you guys can get to them.  And      are there works--I heard that Jefferson and Franklin have works that have      not been published.  Is there anyone--maybe you guys could collaborate      and create an anthology of, you know, publishing the unfinished works.      Are there--I mean, unpublished works by Franklin?  And thank you.      FLATOW:  You're welcome.      Ms. TALBOTT:  Can I speak to that just briefly. . .      FLATOW:  Sure.      Ms. TALBOTT:  . . . to let you know that there's a wonderful      publication--publishing process going on by the Yale University and      American Philosophical Society called The Papers of Benjamin Franklin.      And they've been working hard for almost 50 years to publish the letters      of Franklin and they're up to volume 38, 39 is going to be published      soon.  And they anticipate that it will be about 47 volumes long      ultimately.  So they're working as fast as they can to get all of these      unpublished papers available.      FLATOW:  I'm surprised there are so many.  Wow.      Prof. BRANDS:  Well, and there's one area where there is room for new      discoveries.  Because Franklin wrote so many pieces either anonymously or      pseudonymously, it's--there's still some question about whether      particular pieces were written by Franklin or somebody else and      historians and the scholars can debate these issues.      FLATOW:  Mm-hmm.  And where did the idea for \"Poor Richard's Almanac\"      come from?      Prof. BRANDS:  From other almanacs that were making a lot of money at the      time.      FLATOW:  Oh, is that right?  It was money-making?      Prof. BRANDS:  Oh, yeah, and Franklin looked at these others.  They were      best-sellers and he realized, `Hey, I can do this.  I can probably do it      better than other people and I can sell lots of copies of the almanac and      I can make some money. ' And he did.  He did it in typical Franklin      fashion.  He did it with tongue in cheek and a twinkle in his eye, and it      became a favorite.  Actually, it was never quite the best-selling almanac      in America, but it was the one that had the greatest, I guess you could      say, literary value.  And in publishing the almanac, Franklin did      something that he would do again and again in his life.  He published it      under someone else's name.  The conceit was that this was Richard      Saunders.  This was the Poor Richard.  And for that reason--and I think      Franklin was probably deliberate in this--Poor Richard could say things      that Benjamin Franklin couldn't say.  Benjamin Franklin was this young      businessman in Philadelphia who was trying to gain the respect of his      colleagues and his contemporaries and who had to maintain a certain      public appearance.  But Richard Saunders could say just about anything.      He could say the most outrageous things and Franklin could sort of      maintain this fiction, `Well, that wasn't me that was speaking, that was      Poor Richard. ' And it served him very well over the years.      FLATOW:  Yeah.  The first blog--American blog.      Ms. TALBOTT:  He was amazing how he could put his body into other      persona. His first and best-known is Silence Dogood, a middle-aged woman      who lived out in the country when he was a 16-year-old boy who lived in      Boston.      FLATOW:  Did he make any money on his stove?      Ms. TALBOTT:  Well, the stove wasn't very successful, I have to tell you.      It was a good idea in principle because it was an attempt to avoid the      fires that were taking place where fires in great huge fireplaces would      get out of control.  And also you had this big, cavernous space that was      wasting a lot of energy.  And so it was a box that was stuck into the      fireplace and it worked when you kept it really well-stoked.  But if the      fire started to go out it got pretty smokey.  And, in fact, his stove      designs, which he continued to work on through his life, really      never--never really worked.      Prof. BRANDS:  But even if they had, in this case Franklin wouldn't have      made much money because he refused to try to get a patent on it.  And      he--this is one case where he believed that whatever useful knowledge he      could come up with ought to be the property of the public at large.      FLATOW:  Was he involved in setting up the patenting process in the US?      Ms. TALBOTT:  No, in fact, he didn't--he really didn't approve of it at      all. . .      FLATOW:  He didn't.      Ms. TALBOTT:  . . . as Bill said.      FLATOW:  That's interesting.  1 (800) 989-8255.  Let's go to Les in      Roblas(ph), Arizona.  Hi, Les.      LES (Caller):  Hi, good afternoon.      FLATOW:  Hi, there.      LES:  My question is in light of all of the interest in both physical and      mental health now and concern with diet and things, I've heard that      Franklin was a vegetarian.  Did he offer any insight into any of that or      did he have any ideas about that?      Ms. TALBOTT:  He was briefly a vegetarian, wasn't he, Bill?      Prof. BRANDS:  He was briefly a vegetarian.  In fact, he fell off the      wagon, if you want to call it that, when he got real hungry.      Ms. TALBOTT:  Yeah, he did.      Prof. BRANDS:  He was on a voyage. . .      FLATOW:  Just another guy.      Prof. BRANDS:  Well, he was running away from home, leaving Boston,      heading for what he thought was going to be New York, which would be his      new home.  It turned out to be Philadelphia.  But the ship was becalmed      about halfway there. And so he ran out of provision.  And he watched      while everybody else was eating fish.  They were throwing a line over the      side and pulling up the cod and slicing up the cod and having a wonderful      fried cod dinner.  And Franklin got hungrier and hungrier.  And part of      his vegetarianism was--you could call it a moral version--where he felt      that humans shouldn't eat other animals because they had done no harm to      any other creatures.  And then he was watching the cook slice open one of      these fish and only--and then discovered, to his amazement, that inside      the stomach of one of these fish was a smaller fish.  Whereupon his      hunger and his--I guess you could say--his reasonableness got the better      of him and he says to himself--he's relating this in his      autobiography--he says that--sort of speaking to the fish, `Well, if you      eat other fish, I don't see why I shouldn't eat you. ' And so, at that      point, he decided enough of this vegetarianism and he chowed down on the      cod.      FLATOW:  Thanks for calling, Les.      LES:  Thank you.      FLATOW:  Another example of good old American, well, when you need to      deal with practicality.      We're talking about Ben Franklin this hour on TALK OF THE NATION SCIENCE      FRIDAY from NPR News with Page Talbott, author of \"Benjamin Franklin:  In      Search of a Better World\" and Bill Brands, author of \"The First America:      The Life and Times of Benjamin Franklin. \" Our number, 1 (800) 989-8255.      Anybody on the scene today that would remind you of a Ben Franklin type      of person?      Prof. BRANDS:  I'm asked this question fairly often. . .      FLATOW:  Yeah?      Prof.  BRANDS:  . . . and the answer I come up with is maybe, but you      probably wouldn't--well, you wouldn't find this person in the United      States.  And I think that's the striking thing.  The--one of the reasons      that Franklin was able to accomplish all that he did was that he was      living and operating sort of on the margins of civilization.  Boston,      Philadelphia, as important as they were in the context of the American      colonies, they were marginal to the British Empire, to the centers of      civilization.  If Franklin had been born in London or in Paris where      institutions had already congealed he wouldn't have been able to      accomplish what he did by way of, say, civic improvement in Philadelphia.      He wouldn't have been able to get ahead the way he did in Boston and      Philadelphia because all of the positions that he might have aspired to      were already taken by people with more formal education, with better      connections, with higher birth or that sort of thing.  There might be a      Franklin today but he's probably in, I don't know, Bangalore, India, or      in--somewhere in Mexico or someplace in Brazil or China.      FLATOW:  Would Philadelphia be considered, at that time when Franklin was      at his peak, sort of the science center then of the colonies in the      states?      Ms. TALBOTT:  Well, there were several people who Franklin collaborated      with like Kinnersly and Priestley. . .      FLATOW:  Right.      Ms. TALBOTT:  . . . I think Sing(ph) and so forth who were here in      Philadelphia. Many of them were even part of his club called the Junto.      But, of course, he also corresponded widely and did the kind of      collaboration that we look at today as the best of scientific pursuits      where people are sharing information freely, where they're not holding      back and where they applaud each other's successes and try and build on      what each other is learning.      FLATOW:  What would you like--in about the minute we have left, what      would you like people to remember most, take away from Ben's 300th      birthday?      Prof. BRANDS:  I would say that I think his striking example of someone      who is able to keep an open mind on nearly all important issues through      the entirety of his life.  He became a revolutionary at the age of 70.      He became an abolitionist at the age of 75.  Here's somebody who rather      than falling into the rut of convention or falling into the rut of his      own congealed views, kept an open mind and was able to question just      about everything that he knew right up until the very end of his life.      FLATOW:  Page?      Ms. TALBOTT:  I'd like to think that when people come through our      exhibition, and when people read about Franklin that they will recognize      attributes in themselves in his character and realize that within us      there is the capacity to do extraordinary things just as Franklin did.      FLATOW:  Well, I want to thank you both for taking time to talk with us      on this upcoming anniversary of Ben Franklin's birthday.  Thank      you--300th birthday.  Thank you both, very nice talking with you.      Ms. TALBOTT:  A pleasure.      Prof. BRANDS:  My pleasure.      FLATOW:  You're welcome.

Ever since I was 12 when my seventh-grade term paper was a paper on      Benjamin Franklin I've always been very interested in the history of Ben      Franklin, and next Tuesday marks the 300th birthday of the printer,      postmaster, diplomat, statesman, inventor--you could go on forever with      this list, and for the rest of the hour we're going to be looking back on      the life and times of Franklin. And if you want to talk about Ben, give      us a call.  Our number, 1 (800) 989-8255; 1 (800) 989-TALK.  And as      always, you can surf over to our Web site at sciencefriday. com.       Let me introduce my guests.  H. W. Brands is the Dickson Allen Anderson      Centennial Professor in the Department of History at the University of      Texas in Austin.  He's the author of \"The First American:  The Life and      Times of Benjamin Franklin. \"  He joins us from the studios of KUT in      Austin.       Welcome to the program.       Dr. H. W. BRANDS (Author, \"The First American\"):  Hi, Ira.       FLATOW:  Let me congratulate your team again, if no one else has.       Dr. BRANDS:  Well, a couple of people have, but thank you very much.      We'll accept the congratulations anyway they come.       FLATOW:  In that Rose Bowl.  Page Talbott is the associate director and      chief curator of the Benjamin Franklin Tercentenary, a major exhibit      that's now going on in Philadelphia before it moves around the country      later this year. She's also editor and author of \"Benjamin Franklin:  In      Search of a Better World,\" published this year by Yale University Press.      She joins us from the studios of member station WHYY in Philadelphia.       Welcome to the program.       Ms. PAGE TALBOTT (Author, \"Benjamin Franklin\"):  Good afternoon.       FLATOW:  Good afternoon to you.  Page, exciting time to be in      Philadelphia, I would imagine, when you're talking about Ben Franklin.       Ms. TALBOTT:  It's all Ben all the time.  We're very excited.       FLATOW:  (Laughs) Is it really?  Is he really--for the last 300 years?       Ms. TALBOTT:  Well, you know what?  He really never has left.  He's been      popular for a lot of reasons for a long time.  But this year is sure a      big opportunity for us to revisit Franklin the man and to just look at      his vast numbers of accomplishments.       FLATOW:  What kinds of things would we see at the exhibit if we were to      visit Philadelphia?       Ms. TALBOTT:  Well, we have an 8,000-square-foot exhibition that focuses      on Franklin's entire life, and you'd see a wide range of artifacts      ranging from the first almanac published in 1833 to his own copy of the      US Constitution to his shaving mug--his shaving bowl, I should say--to      his own electrical battery and electrostatic machine, as well as 40      different interactives that explain the nature of his printing and his      experiments on board ship charting the Gulf Stream.       FLATOW:  Right.  Bill Brands, your book calls Franklin the first      American. Why that terminology?       Dr. BRANDS:  Well, for a couple of reasons.  One is, I think, in terms of      chronology, Franklin was the first to embrace an American identity at a      time when most of the other people we've come to call the Founding      Fathers were still thinking of themselves as Englishmen.  As early as the      beginning of 1774, Franklin was brought before the British Privy Council      and, in a rather embarrassing ordeal, was essentially made to answer for      what the British government considered to be the sins of the American      Colonists.  And as I read Franklin, at that point, he came to realize      that he and his fellow Americans would have to embrace their American      identity because the English would never allow them to be full-blown      Englishmen.       Now there's another reason I call him the first American, and that is      that he was, in his day, the pre-eminent--he was the most famous      American.  At a time when no one outside the American Colonies ever heard      of George Washington or Thomas Jefferson or John Adams, people all over      Europe had heard of Benjamin Franklin.  He really was the most famous      person of his generation.  He was first in that regard.       FLATOW:  Mm-hmm.  And let me ask both of you, beginning with Page, though      he did have a--not everything was totally positive, was it?       Ms. TALBOTT:  Well, Franklin was a human being, first and foremost, and      so I think it's really important to recognize the fact that he had warts      like the rest of us.  He was a person who had a difficult family      relationship in many ways with his older son, and he did not live with      his wife for some 27 years. He also was a slaveholder early in his life,      although at the end of his life he was very much of an abolitionist.  So      his is a complex personality, and I think we learn from his      extraordinariness, but we also learn from his foibles.       FLATOW:  Another way to look at, Bill Brands, as the first American.  He      had all kinds of complex properties.       Dr. BRANDS:  Well, he certainly inspired envy in some of his      contemporaries. And one of the intriguing things for me as a biographer      is to figure out how much of the envy he actually earned and how much of      it was just a projection of the emotions of other people.  His      relationship with John Adams was famously difficult, and Adams was one      who was convinced that Franklin was getting far too much credit for the      American Revolution, for everything else that was going on in his times.      And if you look at it from Adams' point of view, it sort of makes sense.      If you look at it from Franklin's point of view, it's easy to see that      Adams was getting excessively worked up over rather minor things.       FLATOW:  Mm-hmm.  One other. . .       Ms. TALBOTT:  It's a wonderful comparison, Ira.  I'm really glad that Dr.      Brands brought this up because the difference between Adams and Franklin      sort of represents the difference between Boston and Philadelphia, in      some ways. Adams really did feel that Franklin was much too French when      he was over in France.  And I think that it was because he was so French      when he was over in France that he was so successful in his dealings      there.       FLATOW:  Yeah, bringing help for the Revolution.       Ms. TALBOTT:  Right.       FLATOW:  And one of the reasons he was so successful there was because of      his famous kite-flying experiment, which was actually done in France      before it was done here, wasn't it?       Ms. TALBOTT:  Well, certainly, there were experiments in relation to it.      There was a experiment that Dalibard did with a sentry box there. . .       FLATOW:  Right.       Ms. TALBOTT:  . . . and it was almost simultaneous with what was going on      back here.  But one of the reasons that Franklin was so famous, and      being--the singular reason that he was most famous abroad was because of      his experiments and his correspondence was vast going back and forth from      America to Europe.       Dr. BRANDS:  And it was precisely for that reason that Franklin was named      to head the diplomatic mission to Paris.  It was supposed to get--the      French alliance was going to make American victory in the War for      Independence possible, because the Continental Congress could have sent      John Adams over and no one would know who he was.  In fact, when Adams      finally got there, he kept being confused with Samuel Adams and he was      simply known around Paris as `the other Adams' at a time when everybody      in France who paid any attention to world affairs or philosophy or      science knew of Benjamin Franklin.  When Franklin arrived in Paris at the      end of 1776, it was--well, the best I can come up with, it was pretty      much like when The Beatles arrived in New York in 1964.  He was--you      could almost liken him to the rock star of his day.  In fact, his image      was all over Paris.  He remarked, only half jestingly, to a friend that      he was more famous in Paris than the man in the moon.       FLATOW:  Hmm.  1 (800) 989-8255.  Lisa in Cleveland, hi.  Welcome to      SCIENCE FRIDAY.       LISA (Caller):  Hi, thanks for taking my call.       FLATOW:  Excuse my cold today, if you will.       LISA:  I was wondering what other inventions is Ben Franklin famous for,      and how did he do this experiment without hurting himself?  I'll hang up.       FLATOW:  OK.  How did he. . .       Ms. TALBOTT:  I can sort of list some of those. . .       FLATOW:  Yes, sure.       Ms. TALBOTT:  . . . inventions, and Bill can join in.  He invented the swim      fins, the bifocals.  He invented the battery.  He invented the      Pennsylvanian stove, which we know as the Franklin stove.  He was the man      who first charted the Gulf Stream, and he applied a previous technology      to coming up with his own version of an odometer for measuring the      distance between post offices.       Dr. BRANDS:  He also invented, or certainly made popular, the lightning      rod, which many people in his day considered to be the most practical,      the most cost-effective invention he'd come up with because it saved      hundreds, perhaps thousands over time, of buildings from destruction.       FLATOW:  Did he not also study ants and invented the harmonia(ph), if I      remember.  I'm going back to, like, seventh grade here.       Dr. BRANDS:  Right, right.       Ms. TALBOTT:  That's right.  Well, he invented the armonica, which is a      wonderful instrument.  I mean, it sort of depends on your fancy.  Do you      like how it sounds, Ira?       FLATOW:  You know, I'm not sure I've ever heard it.       Ms. TALBOTT:  Oh, it's really beautiful.  Come see our show and you'll      get to hear it played there.  It's based on the principle of people      playing music on their wine glasses or water glasses.       FLATOW:  Right, I've seen pictures of it.       Ms. TALBOTT:  Right.       FLATOW:  You have to wet the glass and. . .       Ms. TALBOTT:  You have graduated bowls that are mounted on a metal rod. . .       FLATOW:  Right.       Ms. TALBOTT:  . . . and then you use a treadle to pump it and then you use      your finger dipped in water to play it.  And it's really quite wonderful.       However, there was a problem with it, and that is that the chamber that      housed the glasses was lead and the glass was lead.  And so there      are--some say that people got lead poisoning from playing it.  But      today's versions are not leaded, and they're really quite wonderful.       Dr. BRANDS:  Well, the caller asked. . .       FLATOW:  And to answer. . .       Dr. BRANDS:  I'm sorry, the caller asked how Franklin. . .       FLATOW:  No, I was going to bring that up.  No, go ahead.  I'm sorry.       Dr. BRANDS:  OK.  Yeah--how it was that Franklin didn't kill himself if      his experiments, because these really do fall in the category of `Don't      try this at home. '  And as a matter of fact, Franklin nearly did kill      himself once.  He electrocuted himself in his laboratory.  He was      stunned, he was knocked unconscious briefly and he woke up.  And when he      did wake up, he was able to write down what it felt like and what the      reaction was.  And, in fact, somebody else who tried his kite experiment      was killed.  So it's a. . .       FLATOW:  It was a Russian, right?       Dr. BRANDS:  Yeah, I can't remember the nationality. . .       FLATOW:  Yeah, it was a Russian.       Dr. BRANDS:  . . . but it did take place in Europe, and the unfortunate      experimenter was killed.  So Franklin was pretty convinced that this      stuff up in the sky, lightning, was the same kind of electricity that he      was working with in his laboratory, but even he had no idea how powerful      that stuff was.       FLATOW:  Mm-hmm.  1 (800) 989-8255.  Jim in Spencer, Iowa.  Hi, Jim.       JIM (Caller):  I was curious to know where Ben Franklin got his      resources? Was he, you know, wealthy to begin with, or did he acquire      these, you know, resources on his own?       FLATOW:  A good question.       Ms. TALBOTT:  Franklin. . .       Dr. BRANDS:  Well, Franklin was. . .       Ms. TALBOTT:  Go ahead.       Dr. BRANDS:  Go ahead, Page.       Ms. TALBOTT:  No.       Dr. BRANDS:  OK.  Well, what I was going to say was that Benjamin      Franklin is often cited as the prototype of the American capitalist, and      to some degree he was.  He was a self-made man.  He arrived in      Philadelphia with a couple of dollars in his pocket and went from there      to become not inordinately wealthy, but comfortably wealthy.       But unlike a lot of capitalists, Franklin always believed that whatever      he made was simply to provide him the opportunity to do things that he      really wanted to do.  So he retired from the active practice of his      printing business at the age of 42 to devote himself to what he called      his philosophical research, namely his science experiments.  And for the      rest of his life, he was a silent partner in the printing business, but      he never had to work himself for a living after that.  And so he was able      to fund his own research.       Now I happen to think it was one of the aspects of Franklin's genius to      identify a field of scientific research where, with a relatively modest      outlay of funds and with a relatively short amount of time bringing      himself up to speed, he could make original contributions.  Electricity,      the field of electricity, was in that kind of nascent stage at that time.      If he had tried to study biology or aspects of chemistry, he might not      have been anywhere near so successful.  But the fact of the matter was he      could see where--with a fairly brief amount of time and with the      resources he had at hand--he could purchase or develop the equipment that      he needed, he could bring himself into familiarity with the research of      other people and make a contribution, as he did within just a few years      of starting his researches.       FLATOW:  Page, if you want to add something to--just. . .       Ms. TALBOTT:  Just that he's sort of the first franchise man.  He used      the power of horizontal integration. . .       FLATOW:  Yeah.       Ms. TALBOTT:  . . . and, as Bill was saying, that he was the silent partner,      and so he did receive income from these other printers with--for whom he      provided funds to help set them up in business.       FLATOW:  And he helped start the first post office, did he not?       Ms. TALBOTT:  Well, he was an early post person here in America.  He was      deputy postmaster, and that was a very important vehicle for helping him      get his word out by way of delivering the Pennsylvania Gazette up and      down the Eastern seaboard, all the way--from South Carolina all the way      up to Massachusetts.  And because he had control over the post office, he      had control over distribution.       FLATOW:  Mm-hmm.  We're talking about. . .       Dr. BRANDS:  And just about. . .       FLATOW:  Let me just jump in and do a. . .       Dr. BRANDS:  I'm sorry.       FLATOW:  . . . take care of some business so we can all. . .       Dr. BRANDS:  All right.       FLATOW:  . . . keep the lights on.       Dr. BRANDS:  Sure.       FLATOW:  We're talking about Ben Franklin this hour on TALK OF THE NATION      SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.  Talking with Alan Stern of Southwest      Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado, and Page--I'm sorry H. W.      Brands--reading the wrong part of the paper--H. W. Brands, the Dickson      Allen Anderson Centennial professor, Department of History, University of      Texas in Austin, author of \"The First American:  The Life and Times of      Benjamin Franklin\" and Page Talbott, associate director and chief curator      of the Ben Franklin Tercentenary.  How come we don't just call it a      tricentennial?       Ms. TALBOTT:  Or Ben Franklin 300, how about that?       FLATOW:  After it leaves Philadelphia, how--well, first of all, how long      is it going to be in Philly and where does it go from there?       Ms. TALBOTT:  It's going to be in Philadelphia until April 30th and then      it travels to St. Louis and then Houston, Denver, Atlanta and finally to      Paris.       FLATOW:  All right.       Ms. TALBOTT:  And it closes in 2008.       FLATOW:  2008, so, it's--well, of course, it would have to go to Paris,      one would think.       Ms. TALBOTT:  Of course, it would.       FLATOW:  Of Ben Franklin--can you actually find anything new that hasn't      been written or talked about about Ben Franklin?  Is there more to be      discovered or do you just try to turn the embers over a little bit?       Ms. TALBOTT:  In the course of this project we've been able to learn a      great deal about the material culture of Benjamin Franklin.  In other      words, what he had at home because since this is a exhibition we wanted      to acquire artifacts that related to his life.       FLATOW:  Right.       Ms. TALBOTT:  And so we have his buttons and his sword and his library      chair and so forth.  And my own particular interest is in Ben Franklin      and his domestic life.  And so, for the first time, we've really be able      to get at something that people don't know about Franklin and that is      that he loved to shop.       FLATOW:  No kidding?       Ms. TALBOTT:  Yup.       FLATOW:  He didn't invent the first mall, did he?       Ms. TALBOTT:  Well, you know what?  He would have loved the mall.  He      sent home from England a piece of pottery from every pottery manufactory      in England just because he thought it was so cool.       FLATOW:  OK.       Prof.  BRANDS:  I'll second what Page said regarding what we can find,      what we uncovered these days about Franklin.  In London the Benjamin--the      house where Franklin lived in Craven Street for about 18 years has just      has been--well, I think it's just opening maybe this month after a      considerable refurbishing.       Ms. TALBOTT:  On the birthday, in fact.       Prof. BRANDS:  Right.  OK, and to visit that house is to get a sense of      the--call it the domestic universe that Franklin inhabited.  Houses were      different in those days.  Here was one of the great men of the British      Empire and he was living in a house that would be considered just tiny by      modern standards.  And there's another reason we look at Franklin and      that is even if we don't unearth new information, the questions that we      have of Benjamin Franklin are different than the questions that previous      generations had.  And so people are more willing, or maybe they consider      it much more necessary to examine the domestic life of Franklin to see      how it was that he got along with his illegitimate son, William, and how      William got along with his illegitimate son, William Temple.  The whole      domestic side of the Franklin story takes--plays a larger role, I think,      in biographies these days than it might have 40, 50 years ago.       FLATOW:  Would he have considered himself, by today's standards, just an      ordinary guy?       Prof. BRANDS:  Oh, no.  Franklin didn't consider himself ordinary at all,      although he often had to down--Franklin recognized that he was one of the      geniuses of his time.  But he also realized that if he made too much of      that he wouldn't get very far.  I think this has a lot to do with the      fact that he was one of the very youngest of a very large family.  And as      bright as he was, with a dozen older siblings, you know, they weren't      going to cut him any slack just because he was smart.  In fact, if      anything they would probably beat him up because he was too smart.  So      Franklin learned fairly early on that he could accomplish a lot if he      didn't insist on accomplishing it in the name and for the fame of      Benjamin Franklin.       FLATOW:  Hmm.       Ms. TALBOTT:  So he spoke with a lot of different voices under a lot of      different pseudonyms and he gave other people the credit. . .       FLATOW:  Mm-hmm.  All right, we're going. . .       Ms. TALBOTT:  . . . which was a very savvy way of going about things.       FLATOW:  Yeah, very diplomatic.  You can see diplomacy coming out there      very early.  So hang on there.  We're going to have to take a short break      and come back but we'll talk lots more about Ben Franklin with Page      Talbott and Bill Brands and take your calls.  So stay with us.  We'll      take a short break. Don't go away, we'll be right back.       I'm Ira Flatow.  This is TALK OF THE NATION SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.       (Announcements)       (Soundbite of music)       FLATOW:  You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION SCIENCE FRIDAY.  I am Ira      Flatow.       We're talking this hour about Ben Franklin with my guests Page Talbott,      author of \"Benjamin Franklin:  In Search of a Better World\" published by      Yale University Press, and Bill Brands who is author of \"The First      American:  The Life and Times of Benjamin Franklin. \"       Our number, 1 (800) 989-8255.  Let's go to Pete in Little Rock.  Hi,      Pete.       PETE (Caller):  Hello.       FLATOW:  Hi there.       PETE:  Thanks for the opportunity.  I've been struck by the fact that      historians rely heavily on written correspondence of figures like Ben      Franklin and I was wondering if you guys have a comment about the modern      world and the fact that we all use e-mail and it all gets deleted and      what are future historians are going to be using to do the same kind or      research?       FLATOW:  Interesting question.  Page, any. . .       Prof. BRANDS:  That's a really good. . .       Ms. TALBOTT:  Go ahead, I'd love to hear your answer.       Prof.  BRANDS:  Sure, it's a really good question.  It's already a      problem when we get to the 20th century even before e-mail because public      figures starting with, well, Franklin Roosevelt, but since I live in      Austin I've done some research on Lyndon Johnson.  If you go to the      Johnson library in Austin, it's nearly impossible to find traces--written      traces of Lyndon Johnson because he simply didn't write stuff down.  Now      for the longest time, it was impossible to figure out what Johnson was      thinking, what Johnson was doing. Only in the last, well, several years      now the library has released tape recordings of Johnson's telephone      calls.  Johnson did his political business by telephone and it just so      happens that the White House, with Johnson's approval, recorded a lot of      this stuff.  But now that people are using e-mail and to the extent that      e-mail gets erased, I really don't know what we're going to rely on.      However, I happen to think--I do know that presidents, for example, and      famous people tend to keep records of things.  Now--but that brings up an      important point.  We can write history about famous people because famous      people either keep their own correspondence or other people who receive      the correspondence keep the correspondence of the famous people.       With Benjamin Franklin, though, I'll tell you it's really difficult to      write much of substance about the first 30 years of Franklin's life.  He      wasn't yet famous and so nobody kept records about Benjamin Franklin.  We      have to rely on his own autobiography.  Once he becomes famous, then      people keep his letters and we can track him.  It's going to be a real      problem when we're trying to write the history of the beginning of the      21st century and I don't know exactly how we're going to solve it.       PETE:  Yeah.  I'd like to make a follow-up comment.  I was just going to      say that like Ken Burns' \"Civil War\" that was a historical even that was      completely dependent on letters.       FLATOW:  But he also had photographs, you know.  I'm also reminded--of      one historian was telling, you know, when you take digital pictures in      cameras now you don't have the extra photos we used to take home from the      drugstore.  We'd keep them lying around.  Now you just erase everything      from the camera.       PETE:  Yeah.       FLATOW:  And they might be an interesting historical record, too.      Thank--good call, Pete, thanks for calling.       PETE:  Thank you.       Prof. BRANDS:  For my part, one of the things I tell my students is if      they want to become immortal, all they have to do is keep a diary.  And I      tell them to keep a written diary and keep it relatively faithfully, but      just make sure that when they die they turn it over to the local      historical society because if they do, then they will be immortal in the      sense that historians 100 years from now, 200 years from now who are      wanting to write the history of daily life of our times will turn to      those sorts of sources because they're going to be so rare.       FLATOW:  Really interesting.  1 (800) 989-8255.  Would it fair--you know,      Americans have the reputation of good old Yankee ingenuity and America      being a country of tinkerers.  Would it be fair to say that started with      Franklin, that reputation and that idea that he was a tinkerer, that then      permeated later on?       Ms. TALBOTT:  One of the things that I liked about Franklin the most is      his great curiosity and also his desire to find simple solutions to      things.  So I think that the answer to your question would be he's      certainly the most famous of the early founding fathers to adopt the idea      of tinkerer.  You know, people associate him with these really wonderful      inventions, particularly the lightening rod.  But most of all he was not      interested in science for science sake as, you know, a pure scientist.      He really was just infinitely interested in everything around him.  He      received--he purchased a microscope in 1750 and he describes what he saw      with words that are almost poetic.  He describes the beauty and the      delicacy and the frailty of the little pieces of moss that he's looking      at.  And I just get the sense that he was somebody who had his--this      wonderful sense of wonder. . .       FLATOW: Yeah.       Ms. TALBOTT:  . . . that went on to becoming something that helped him      improve the world around him.       FLATOW:  Mm-hmm.       Prof. BRANDS:  When I read Frank. . .       FLATOW:  Well. . .       Prof. BRANDS:  Excuse me.  When I read Franklin and his assessment of the      world around him, I'm struck that there seemed to be two influences that      come together.  One is that very practical, you call it the Yankee      inventor, innovator who wants to see how to make peoples' lives better.      His Philadelphia--the Pennsylvania fireplace, for example, is a good      example of this.       But at the same time, just as Page says, there is this almost child-like      wonder that he manages to retain until he's 80 years old.  And every time      he sees something new he wants to know what causes, what makes it work,      what it all means.  It's a remarkable combination that's not commonly      found.       FLATOW:  Of course, one of his contemporaries was sort of a tinkerer.      I'm talking about Thomas Jefferson.  If you go to Monticello, you look at      his home and you see all these things that he's built in his home.  Was      there any--did they talk to each other?  Did they have any sort of, you      know, discussions about scientific knowledge or nature that we know of?       Ms. TALBOTT:  Don't forget that Jefferson was much younger than Franklin.      I mean, there are a lot of common denominators between them, but      Franklin was more than a full generation older than Jefferson.       Prof. BRANDS:  And I think that's one of the reasons that Jefferson got      along much better with Franklin than John Adams did.  Adams was several      years--many years younger than Franklin but he was close enough that      he--at least as I read it--he seemed to feel competitive with Franklin.      Jefferson doesn't seem that way at all.  Jefferson, in fact, famously      after he was named American ambassador in Paris after Franklin left, he      was often introduced around as the person who replaced Benjamin Franklin.      He would say, `No one can replace Dr. Franklin.  I'm merely his      successor. '       FLATOW:  But you don't know if he had any correspondence or any, you      know, scientific. . .       Ms. TALBOTT:  There's not much in the correspondence. . .       FLATOW:  . . . head-to-head or toe-to-toe.       Ms. TALBOTT:  . . . between them.  They overlapped politically but clearly      they were both interested in practical solutions to things.       FLATOW:  Yeah.       Ms. TALBOTT:  And they were both involved in the construction of their      houses and in coming up with useful articles for daily living.       FLATOW:  And, of course, in those days Philadelphia was not, you know,      was not that close to Virginia.  It was. . .       Ms. TALBOTT:  Right, right.       FLATOW:  . . . some sort of a ride to get there.  The metro--never mind.  1      (800) 989-8255.  Kim in East Lansing.  Hi, Kim.       KIM (Caller):  Hi, I wish you guys could have a spot of camomile with me.      I have two quick questions.  I just want to, well, thank SCIENCE FRIDAY      and ask callers to speak more quickly so you guys can get to them.  And      are there works--I heard that Jefferson and Franklin have works that have      not been published.  Is there anyone--maybe you guys could collaborate      and create an anthology of, you know, publishing the unfinished works.      Are there--I mean, unpublished works by Franklin?  And thank you.       FLATOW:  You're welcome.       Ms. TALBOTT:  Can I speak to that just briefly. . .       FLATOW:  Sure.       Ms. TALBOTT:  . . . to let you know that there's a wonderful      publication--publishing process going on by the Yale University and      American Philosophical Society called The Papers of Benjamin Franklin.      And they've been working hard for almost 50 years to publish the letters      of Franklin and they're up to volume 38, 39 is going to be published      soon.  And they anticipate that it will be about 47 volumes long      ultimately.  So they're working as fast as they can to get all of these      unpublished papers available.       FLATOW:  I'm surprised there are so many.  Wow.       Prof. BRANDS:  Well, and there's one area where there is room for new      discoveries.  Because Franklin wrote so many pieces either anonymously or      pseudonymously, it's--there's still some question about whether      particular pieces were written by Franklin or somebody else and      historians and the scholars can debate these issues.       FLATOW:  Mm-hmm.  And where did the idea for \"Poor Richard's Almanac\"      come from?       Prof. BRANDS:  From other almanacs that were making a lot of money at the      time.       FLATOW:  Oh, is that right?  It was money-making?       Prof. BRANDS:  Oh, yeah, and Franklin looked at these others.  They were      best-sellers and he realized, `Hey, I can do this.  I can probably do it      better than other people and I can sell lots of copies of the almanac and      I can make some money. ' And he did.  He did it in typical Franklin      fashion.  He did it with tongue in cheek and a twinkle in his eye, and it      became a favorite.  Actually, it was never quite the best-selling almanac      in America, but it was the one that had the greatest, I guess you could      say, literary value.  And in publishing the almanac, Franklin did      something that he would do again and again in his life.  He published it      under someone else's name.  The conceit was that this was Richard      Saunders.  This was the Poor Richard.  And for that reason--and I think      Franklin was probably deliberate in this--Poor Richard could say things      that Benjamin Franklin couldn't say.  Benjamin Franklin was this young      businessman in Philadelphia who was trying to gain the respect of his      colleagues and his contemporaries and who had to maintain a certain      public appearance.  But Richard Saunders could say just about anything.      He could say the most outrageous things and Franklin could sort of      maintain this fiction, `Well, that wasn't me that was speaking, that was      Poor Richard. ' And it served him very well over the years.       FLATOW:  Yeah.  The first blog--American blog.       Ms. TALBOTT:  He was amazing how he could put his body into other      persona. His first and best-known is Silence Dogood, a middle-aged woman      who lived out in the country when he was a 16-year-old boy who lived in      Boston.       FLATOW:  Did he make any money on his stove?       Ms. TALBOTT:  Well, the stove wasn't very successful, I have to tell you.      It was a good idea in principle because it was an attempt to avoid the      fires that were taking place where fires in great huge fireplaces would      get out of control.  And also you had this big, cavernous space that was      wasting a lot of energy.  And so it was a box that was stuck into the      fireplace and it worked when you kept it really well-stoked.  But if the      fire started to go out it got pretty smokey.  And, in fact, his stove      designs, which he continued to work on through his life, really      never--never really worked.       Prof. BRANDS:  But even if they had, in this case Franklin wouldn't have      made much money because he refused to try to get a patent on it.  And      he--this is one case where he believed that whatever useful knowledge he      could come up with ought to be the property of the public at large.       FLATOW:  Was he involved in setting up the patenting process in the US?       Ms. TALBOTT:  No, in fact, he didn't--he really didn't approve of it at      all. . .       FLATOW:  He didn't.       Ms. TALBOTT:  . . . as Bill said.       FLATOW:  That's interesting.  1 (800) 989-8255.  Let's go to Les in      Roblas(ph), Arizona.  Hi, Les.       LES (Caller):  Hi, good afternoon.       FLATOW:  Hi, there.       LES:  My question is in light of all of the interest in both physical and      mental health now and concern with diet and things, I've heard that      Franklin was a vegetarian.  Did he offer any insight into any of that or      did he have any ideas about that?       Ms. TALBOTT:  He was briefly a vegetarian, wasn't he, Bill?       Prof. BRANDS:  He was briefly a vegetarian.  In fact, he fell off the      wagon, if you want to call it that, when he got real hungry.       Ms. TALBOTT:  Yeah, he did.       Prof. BRANDS:  He was on a voyage. . .       FLATOW:  Just another guy.       Prof. BRANDS:  Well, he was running away from home, leaving Boston,      heading for what he thought was going to be New York, which would be his      new home.  It turned out to be Philadelphia.  But the ship was becalmed      about halfway there. And so he ran out of provision.  And he watched      while everybody else was eating fish.  They were throwing a line over the      side and pulling up the cod and slicing up the cod and having a wonderful      fried cod dinner.  And Franklin got hungrier and hungrier.  And part of      his vegetarianism was--you could call it a moral version--where he felt      that humans shouldn't eat other animals because they had done no harm to      any other creatures.  And then he was watching the cook slice open one of      these fish and only--and then discovered, to his amazement, that inside      the stomach of one of these fish was a smaller fish.  Whereupon his      hunger and his--I guess you could say--his reasonableness got the better      of him and he says to himself--he's relating this in his      autobiography--he says that--sort of speaking to the fish, `Well, if you      eat other fish, I don't see why I shouldn't eat you. ' And so, at that      point, he decided enough of this vegetarianism and he chowed down on the      cod.       FLATOW:  Thanks for calling, Les.       LES:  Thank you.       FLATOW:  Another example of good old American, well, when you need to      deal with practicality.       We're talking about Ben Franklin this hour on TALK OF THE NATION SCIENCE      FRIDAY from NPR News with Page Talbott, author of \"Benjamin Franklin:  In      Search of a Better World\" and Bill Brands, author of \"The First America:      The Life and Times of Benjamin Franklin. \" Our number, 1 (800) 989-8255.       Anybody on the scene today that would remind you of a Ben Franklin type      of person?       Prof. BRANDS:  I'm asked this question fairly often. . .       FLATOW:  Yeah?       Prof.  BRANDS:  . . . and the answer I come up with is maybe, but you      probably wouldn't--well, you wouldn't find this person in the United      States.  And I think that's the striking thing.  The--one of the reasons      that Franklin was able to accomplish all that he did was that he was      living and operating sort of on the margins of civilization.  Boston,      Philadelphia, as important as they were in the context of the American      colonies, they were marginal to the British Empire, to the centers of      civilization.  If Franklin had been born in London or in Paris where      institutions had already congealed he wouldn't have been able to      accomplish what he did by way of, say, civic improvement in Philadelphia.      He wouldn't have been able to get ahead the way he did in Boston and      Philadelphia because all of the positions that he might have aspired to      were already taken by people with more formal education, with better      connections, with higher birth or that sort of thing.  There might be a      Franklin today but he's probably in, I don't know, Bangalore, India, or      in--somewhere in Mexico or someplace in Brazil or China.       FLATOW:  Would Philadelphia be considered, at that time when Franklin was      at his peak, sort of the science center then of the colonies in the      states?       Ms. TALBOTT:  Well, there were several people who Franklin collaborated      with like Kinnersly and Priestley. . .       FLATOW:  Right.       Ms. TALBOTT:  . . . I think Sing(ph) and so forth who were here in      Philadelphia. Many of them were even part of his club called the Junto.      But, of course, he also corresponded widely and did the kind of      collaboration that we look at today as the best of scientific pursuits      where people are sharing information freely, where they're not holding      back and where they applaud each other's successes and try and build on      what each other is learning.       FLATOW:  What would you like--in about the minute we have left, what      would you like people to remember most, take away from Ben's 300th      birthday?       Prof. BRANDS:  I would say that I think his striking example of someone      who is able to keep an open mind on nearly all important issues through      the entirety of his life.  He became a revolutionary at the age of 70.      He became an abolitionist at the age of 75.  Here's somebody who rather      than falling into the rut of convention or falling into the rut of his      own congealed views, kept an open mind and was able to question just      about everything that he knew right up until the very end of his life.       FLATOW:  Page?       Ms. TALBOTT:  I'd like to think that when people come through our      exhibition, and when people read about Franklin that they will recognize      attributes in themselves in his character and realize that within us      there is the capacity to do extraordinary things just as Franklin did.       FLATOW:  Well, I want to thank you both for taking time to talk with us      on this upcoming anniversary of Ben Franklin's birthday.  Thank      you--300th birthday.  Thank you both, very nice talking with you.       Ms. TALBOTT:  A pleasure.       Prof. BRANDS:  My pleasure.       FLATOW:  You're welcome.  Bill Brand of the Dickinson--the Dickson Allen      and Anderson Centennial professor department of history at the University      of Texas in Austin, author of \"The First American:  The Life and Times of      Benjamin Franklin\" and published by Random House; Page Talbott, associate      director and chief curator of the Ben Franklin Tercentenary--that's 300.      She's also editor and author of \"Benjamin Franklin:  In Search of a      Better World\" published by Yale University Press.  Thanks again for      joining us.       And we're going to go out with some music played a glass harmonica,      believe it or not.  We've dug it up, been playing it for you today.      Listen to it in the background.

(Soundbite of music) FLATOW: You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow. For the rest of the hour, a look inside the often mysterious world of autism through the eyes of someone who has made a career out of overcoming the roadblocks the illness put in her way. Temple Grandin doesn't see the world like most of us do. She does, she would say, see the world more like most animals: a place of fear without emotion where your thoughts come to you in pictures rather than in words. Temple Grandin is autistic. Her writings about her struggles with autism, her fear, her anxiety, the overwhelming sensation of smell and sound, provide an intriguing glimpse into the world of autistic people. Because of her autism Dr. Grandin says she can understand how animals see the world in a way that most humans cannot. She has written about her experiences with autism and her observations of animals in many books. You may remember her Thinking in Pictures. Well, her latest book is Animals In Translation. She now joins us. Let me formally introduce her. Temple Grandin is an Associate Professor of Animal Science at Colorado State University in Fort Collins. Animals in Translation: Using the Mysteries of Autism to Decode Animal Behavior is co-authored with Katherine Johnson. She joins us from studies of KPBS in San Diego. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY, Dr. Grandin. Dr. TEMPLE GRANDIN (Colorado State University): It's good to be here. FLATOW: How has your book been received? Dr. GRANDIN: Well, there's been a lot of interest in it. I was really happy to say that we're making some of the bestseller lists. But let's get into talking about how autism is similar animal behavior. The thing is I don't think in a language and animals don't think in a language. It's sensory based thinking, thinking in pictures, thinking in smells, thinking in touches. It's putting these sensory based memories into categories. That's the basis of how an animal would think. One thing I want to say is, animals do have emotion. But fear tends to be one of the most primal emotions. FLATOW: So you don't read animals minds, don't want our listeners to confuse that? Dr. GRANDIN: No. And I always get asked all the time about animal communicators and I really don't want to get into a discussing whether ESP exists or not. Let's just stick with, you know, the other more concrete things. FLATOW: Mm hmm. Yeah. Dr. GRANDIN: Because that's how I think. FLATOW: Yeah. Dr. GRANDIN: I think in most cases, a lot of these animal communicators are very good animal behavior people. And a lot of them are visual thinkers and their picking up very subtle body cues from the animal. You know, it's crouching down a little bit, it's moving around little bit differently. They're just very good at reading animal behavior. And I think in most cases that can explain some of their successes. FLATOW: And why do you think your autism allows you to understand how animals think? Dr. GRANDIN: Well to understand animal thinking you've got to get away from a language. See my mind works like Google for images. You put in a key word; it brings up pictures. See language for me narrates the pictures in my mind. When I work on designing livestock equipment I can test run that equipment in my head like 3-D virtual reality. In fact, when I was in college I used to think that everybody was able to do that. And language just sort of, you know, gives an opinion. Like, oh, that's a good idea or oh, I just figured out how to design that. Language is not actually used in the actual designing process that is all done in pictures. FLATOW: Mm hmm. When did you first discover that you could do this? That you could understand how animals think? Dr. GRANDIN: Well, the thing is, I thought everybody thought in pictures. When I was in high school and college, I thought everybody could think in pictures. And my first inkling to my thinking was even different was when I was in college and I read an article about you know, some scientist said that the caveman could not have designed tools until they had language. And then when I did Thinking in Pictures I started interviewing people in detail about how they thought. And that really gave me insight into how my thinking was different. And that some people think much more in words. And then I'm thinking, well, that has to be how an animal would think. There's no other way an animal could possibly think. FLATOW: And so you've been able to design a device that animals will readily use as where other people have failed? Because you can think \u2026 Dr. GRANDIN: Well, back\u2026 FLATOW: \u2026how they think? Dr. GRANDIN: The first thing I thought about is how they see. I mean, I'd read in my physiology books that, when I was in college, that cattle had 360-degree vision. And I was out in the feed yards in Arizona back in the 1970s. And, you know, some of the cows would just walk up the shoots to get their vaccinations. Other cattle would refuse to go through the shoots. So I got down in the shoots to take pictures of what the cattle were seeing. And people thought that was just kind of crazy. And I found that they were afraid of shadows. They were afraid of a reflection off the bumper of a truck. They were afraid of seeing people up ahead. And if you remove these visual-based details, then the cattle would walk right up the shoot. In the beginning when I first started doing that, I mean people just couldn't even see why I was doing it. FLATOW: Yeah, you write in your book about how you've noticed that animals do not like to stand with their legs crossed or feet together. And that some of the pens were forcing them to do that and you designed that out of it. Dr. GRANDIN: Well, that's getting into the restrainer systems that I designed in the 1990s. I designed a system holding a cattle in the meat plant, where they straddle a conveyor. And if you get things set up right they just walk in really quietly. And you've got to get the lighting right. They're afraid of the dark. If the lights were going, blasting in their eyes like the sun or there's a reflection on a shinny piece of metal moving, they're going to be afraid of that. And you get rid of those things their afraid of then their going to walk right in. You know, the things that scare a prey/species animal like cattle are a whole lot of little visual details that people just don't tend to notice. And one of the big problems they used to have is the people just wanted to get out there and yell and scream and push and shove and you know more and more prods. Rather than remove the things that the cattle were afraid of. FLATOW: You also talk about animals having special talents. Like special talents autistic people may have. Dr. GRANDIN: Well some autistic people have savant skills. All autistic people do not have savant skills. Autism is a very variable disorder varying all the way from Einstein, emollient scientist, just a little bit of the trait, many scientist and engineers, down to somebody that's going to remain nonverbal. There is a small segment of people with autism that have savant skills, where they can memorize entire maps of whole entire city. They can do calendar calculations. And this is similar to some of the skills that animals have. Take bird migration for example. You know a Canada goose only has to be shown the route once and then he remembers the way. And this is sensory based memory. Because if you take a carrier pigeon and you take it somewhere and let it go and then it comes back home again. It remembers the things it sees and smells along the way. FLATOW: Yeah. Dr. GRANDIN: But if you put him in a smell-proof, vision-proof box, he's not going to find his way back home. FLATOW: Right. What about the special powers we think animals have. For example sensory powers, they can predict or when an earthquake is coming. We hear stories during the Tsunami that the animals knew enough to get out of the way in advance. Dr. GRANDIN: Well, I think their hearing, you know, low frequency sounds you know as the tidal wave was coming in. I mean their just, animals have very sensitive hearing. And they're hearing those sounds and they're trying to move away from them basically. FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255, 1-800-989-TALK. Mike Inifik(ph) in New York, hi, welcome. MIKE (Caller): Hi, hi Ira, hi Dr. Grandin, very nice to get a chance to talk to you. First time I was aware of your existence is when you were on Terry Gross's program. And I was thinking holy mackerel, this persons mind works a lot the way mine does. And I read an article about Asperger's syndrome came out of the New York Times. And a friend of mine showed it to me and said this describes me all over. So I got a bit curious about it and I read the Curious Incidents of the Dog in The Night Time, which is a semi autobiographical account. And I became interested in it and I found a fascinating web site. And I'm wondering if you're aware of it, it's by some one named Andrew Lahman L-A-H-M-A-N and maybe two N's and it's called Origins of Autism. It's either originsofautism. com, or dot org. And in this he presents the hypothesis that autism is in fact an adaptation, not a disorder. That it can go wrong, but when it goes right it enables people to be more predisposed to have certain kinds of occupations. It's a predisposition not a predetermination. Any person can get any king of occupation. But that autistic people tend to be particularly predisposed to do better at certain occupations that include science, inventing, music, dancing, the visual arts and things like this. While people who aren't autistic tend to do better at more practical jobs, not that each can't do the other's jobs. But they do better with the job their body and brain is more adapted to. And he argued that this adaptation evolved at the time that the Bonobos separated from the chimp. He argues that the Bonobo separated from the regular chimp and then the Bonobo predicated into the Bonobos of today. FLATOW: Mm hmm. Dr. GRANDIN: I would\u2026 FLATOW: Go ahead. Dr. GRANDIN: You know, I think that autistic brains tend to be specialized brains. Autistic people tend to be less social. It takes a ton of processor space in the brain to have all the social circuits. I mean after all, the first stone spear was not designed by the totally social people. Let me just tell you about some research. Some of Simon Baron Cohan's research in England showed that there's two and a half times as many engineers in the family history of the people with autism. I feel very strongly that if you got rid of all of the autistic genetics you're not going to have any scientists. There'd be no computer people. You'd lose a lot of artists and musicians. There'd be a horrible price to pay. It's like a little bit of the autistic trait can give some advantages. You get too much of the autistic trait then you get a very severe handicap where the person's going to remain non-verbal. It's a continuum from a severe handicap all the way up to something where it's a personality variant. There's no black and white dividing line between a mild Aspergers, which is the mild autism, and computer engineer, for example. FLATOW: Mm hmm, mm hmm. What do you want people to know or understand most about autistic people? What do you think is most misunderstood about them? Dr. GRANDIN: Well, it's a lot of things that are misunderstood. One of the things I want to mention is if you see a child with autistic-like behaviors at age two and three, the worst thing you can do is just let them sit and watch TV all day. That's just the worst thing you can do. You need to have a teacher working with that child, working on teaching language, working on social interaction, working on getting them interested in different things, and keeping their brain connected to the world. Autism is a neurological disorder. It's not caused by bad parenting. It's caused by, you know, abnormal development in the brain. The emotional circuits in the brain are abnormal. And there also are differences in the white matter, which is the brain's computer cables that hook up the different brain departments. This is the research of Dr. Eric Corshane(ph) out in San Diego. In fact, in my new edition of Thinking in Pictures, I review this research. FLATOW: Mm hmm. 1-800-989-8255 is our number. Temple, you credit much of your success to a high school science teacher. Tell us about that, please. Dr. GRANDIN: Yes. Yes, Mr. Carlock(ph). I was a goof-around student who just wasn't interested in school, just didn't want to study, totally bored with school. High school was a disaster. I got kicked out of a large girls' school because I threw a book at a girl after she teased me. And I was sent away to a special boarding school for emotionally disturbed children. You've got to remember, this is the \u201860s. And so they now know that autism's not an emotional disturbance. But they didn't know that in the \u201860s. And I was still a goof-around student. Now, they had horseback riding. That was one of my favorite things to do. We had model rocket club. We had electronics club. These were all activities where I could get away from teasing and get in with other students where I had shared interests, you know. FLATOW: Mm hmm. Dr. GRANDIN: People with autism aren't interested in social chit-chat. And Mr. Carlock, I mean, took my interests and used that as a way to motivate me to study science. And I mean Mr. Carlock was an extremely important mentor in helping me to develop. And when you look at, let's look at the people with the milder forms of autism that are successful. They have their area of strength, you know, built-up on. I have a career that involves using my visual thinking skill for designing. And then mentor teachers, another really, really important thing because the autistic brain tends to be a specialist brain, good at one thing, bad at something else. I'm a visual thinker, really bad at algebra. There's others that are a pattern thinker. These are the music and math minds. They think in patterns instead of pictures. Then there's another type that's not a visual thinker at all, and they're the ones that memorize all of the sports statistics, all of the weather statistics. It's kind of a language-logic mind. FLATOW: Mm hmm. 1-800-989-8255 is our number. We're talking with Dr. Temple Grandin, author now out in paperback, Animals in Translation on Talk of the Nation Science Friday from NPR News. Hey, is that what you mean when you say about normal people not being detail-oriented like the way you are and animals are? Dr. GRANDIN: Well, the thing is, my thinking is sensory-detailed oriented. You can also have details of words, and there's some details of words that I don't, I'm not very good at. But I'm talking about sensory detail, visual detail, detail of some little small sound. I mean, think of all the smell detail that the dog gets. I mean, he checks out the local fire hydrant and he knows who's been there, when they were there, how long ago they were there, and are they friend or foe. That's a lot of information on the fire hydrant just from different smells. FLATOW: Yes. They have to be detail-oriented because that's how they survive. Dr. GRANDIN: And it's also how they think. And animals actually, you know, can solve problems under new conditions. And how do you have a think in pictures? Well, you have to sort the pictures into categories. You know, for example, a dog knows that, you know, there's good people and there's bad people. And I talked to a lady the other day where her dog was afraid of people with white beards because she had adopted him from an animal shelter and somebody with a white beard had abused him. And this dog was now afraid of everybody that had a white beard. That was the bad category. FLATOW: Mm hmm, mm hmm. I think a lot of people are surprised when they hear you speak and read your writings about your knowledge about how animals think, your sensitivity to their feelings, to learn that you're not a vegetarian. Dr. GRANDIN: No, I played around with vegetarianism back in the \u201870s. One thing, my physiology just got to have animal protein. I get hypoglycemic, I get all light-headed unless I eat animal protein. And I did a lot of thinking about this and I've designed a lot of equipment for meat plants. The cattle would have never been foreign, you know, if we hadn't raised them. And I feel very strongly, we've got to give animals a good life. I've worked really hard improving slaughter plants and animal handling and transport. And people have said to me, why don't you work on improving conditions on pig farms? And basically, to be effective on making real change out there on the ground, you can only work on so many things. You know, you get too distributed, you're not effective. And, you know, I've got my one area I work in and I want to educate people about autism and I also want to improve, you know, animal handling and transport and make a real change out in the field on the ground. FLATOW: Do you have a project you're working on someplace in the country? Dr. GRANDIN: Well, right now I've been just non-stop travel with speaking engagements. FLATOW: Yeah. Dr. GRANDIN: At the age of 58 years old, you kind of get to the point in your career where I want to pass my knowledge on. And I've got two big projects coming up. I'm going to be visiting two different universities for a week. I'm going to Cornell University in February as a visiting professor and give talks on animal handling. And I'm kind of at the point where I want to like, you know, pass my knowledge on. FLATOW: Yeah. Do you talk to the vets at the vet school there? Dr. GRANDIN: Yes. In fact, I've got a meeting lined up with North Carolina State University at their veterinary school. And I'll be talking to the veterinary students at Cornell. FLATOW: Do you think it's necessary for them to learn about animals before they become vets? Dr. GRANDIN: Well, there's a lot, you know, there's a lot of things to animal behavior that vets need to learn about. I mean, just the other day they thought my, I have an assistant named Mark, and we thought that his dog might have a bladder infection. And the vet wanted to take poor Red Dog and throw her on her back and stretch her out on the exam table, no sedatives or anything, stick a needle into her belly for a urine sample. FLATOW: Mm hmm. Dr. GRANDIN: And I said that's too traumatic a thing to do to Red Dog. She's a very, very high-strung dog, and she's likely to be traumatized by that. We're not going to do that. We need a urine sample. We'll get her to pee in a cup. FLATOW: Yeah. That's good, that could\u2026 DR. GRANDIN: We're not going to traumatize her putting her on her back. FLATOW: All right. Stay with us, Dr. Grandin, and everybody wanting to speak with Dr. Grandin, with Temple Grandin. We're going to take a short break and come right back. Don't go away. I'm Ira Flatow. This is Talk of the Nation Science Friday from NPR News. You're listening to Talk of the Nation Science Friday from NPR News. I'm Ira Flatow. We're talking this hour about autism with my guest, Dr. Temple Grandin, Associate Professor of Animal Science at Colorado State University in Fort Collins. Her latest book out in paperback, Animals in Translation: Using the Mysteries of Autism to Decode Animal Behavior. Our number, 1-800-989-8255. Let's go to the phones. Let's go to Joel in Sacramento. Hi, Joel. JOEL (caller): Hello there. It's a privilege to talk to you both. My question is based on the fact that my mother works with autistic students in junior high school and has a difficult challenge because she works in teaching them English, reading, and sometimes math. And the problem that she's observed, and perhaps, Doctor, you may have a comment on this based on your personal experience or study, is the students will often display just outward, to her it seems to be out of nowhere, just this terrible fear. They get terrified and she cannot get through to them to the point where often they have to be taken out of the class. And would you, perhaps, have one or two simple suggestions that my mother could use in calming a student down and directing them to the lesson? Or maybe we're looking at this all wrong. Dr. GRANDIN: Okay. Let's talk about the fear problem. Fear was my main emotion until I started taking anti-depressant medication. And I was one of the people where, as I got older, the fear got worse and worse. So I can really relate to an animal getting, you know, scared and traumatized. Some of these fears these students have are sensory based. You know, when I was a little kid and the school bell went off, it hurt my ears like a dentist drill. You know, maybe the kid sees a cell phone and the ring on that cell phone hurts that kid's ears. So, if he just sees that cell phone he's going to panic because it's a dangerous thing that might go off. Things like microphones are dangerous things because you never know when they might feedback and squeal. There's a lot of different things that can set off this fear reaction. And I would probably need to talk to your wife a whole lot more to figure out just which situations they're getting the fear reaction in. But a lot of this is sensory. And an adult or a child that has a tantrum and just goes ballistic every time you take him in a big supermarket, that is usually due to sensory overload. They may not be able to tolerate smells in the detergent aisle, the fluorescent lights flicker and make the supermarket look like a discoth\u00e8que, or it may be just noise overload and they feel like they're inside the speaker at the rock and roll concert. But these sensory problems are very variable from really mild to just overwhelmingly bad. FLATOW: All right. Good luck, Joel. JOEL: Thank you. We'll take that and see if we can figure out what it is that is really upsetting them and perhaps remove that from them. FLATOW: Thank you. Dr. GRANDIN: Yes. We need to\u2026 JOEL: I'll relay that to my mother. Thank you. FLATOW: Good luck. Dr. GRANDIN: I'm sorry. It's your mother. Okay. I'm sorry. FLATOW: Dr. Grandin, what was it that you did that you were able to overcome? You mentioned some medication you were using? What point did you say I'm going to overcome these fears and these obstacles? Dr. GRANDIN: Well, the thing is, autism is all different, you know, variables. And you start out with a certain amount of, you know, the point where the differences in the brain are going to just be a personality variant and, like, for very mild Asperger's. FLATOW: Mm hmm. Dr. GRANDIN: But you get into more severe kinds of autism where there's obvious speech delay, obvious abnormal behavior in a two and three-year-old child, you know, the initial neurology is different from case to case. But all children with autism are going to do better if they get really good educational intervention. And there's a lot of controversy as to which programs you use. I have found that the most important thing is a good teacher. Some teachers just know how to work with a child and get progress and others don't. And you need lots of hours with a good teacher in these really young kids. FLATOW: Mm hmm. 1-800-989-8255 is our number. Let's talk for a bit about something you designed, and was very interesting to read about, called a squeeze machine. Dr. GRANDIN: Okay. FLATOW: Tell us about your squeeze machine. Dr. GRANDIN: Well, when I, when puberty hit, that's when the anxiety attacks and the panic attacks started. I was a type of person with autism where once there was puberty, non-stop panic attacks. I mean, imagine how you felt when you did your first really big, important, you know, interview, how nervous you were. Now, imagine if that's the way you felt all the time, all the time. Now, there's other people with Asperger's and autism that don't get nervous. This is where, you know, autism can be very variable. And I was watching cattle go through a squeeze chute for their vaccinations. It's a device they put the cattle in to hold them still. And I noticed that some of the cattle just kind of relaxed. So I went and tried out the squeeze chute. And the pressure calmed me down. Many individuals with autism find that deep pressure applied over large areas of the body has a very, very calming effect on the nervous system. So then I built a squeezing machine that I could get into that worked with an air cylinder and an air compressor where I could work a little control handle and I could squeeze myself. And I used that to calm down. Now, as I got into my 20s, my anxiety got worse and worse and worse. And in early 30s I went on antidepressant medication. I would not be here today if I hadn't gone on that medication. But, you know, exercise is another thing that's also very calming but, you know, this is common, the pressure seeking\u2026 FLATOW: Do you still have your squeezebox? Dr. GRANDIN: I still have my squeezebox, yes I do. FLATOW: Yeah, okay, 1-800-989-8255 is our number. While we get people on the phone I want to also ask you about meeting and studying B. F. Skinner. We all, I mean I'm a contemporary of yours, probably about the same age. I remember in college in the \u201860s, all I studied was B. F. Skinner and his white rats in the boxes, running mazes and things. You write a lot about that and also about meeting him. Dr. GRANDIN: Well, I want to start out that I was lucky in the \u201860s to also be taking a class in Classical Ethology by a professor named Tom Evans, where I learned that operant conditioning does not explain all animal behavior. He explained how fixed action patterns and hardwired instinctual behavior works. And I remember going on a visit to Dr. Skinner and I felt like I was visiting, you know, the grand temple of psychology. And I went up to his office and, you know, he seemed, I'm like, oh, you mean he's actually an ordinary person? And we got to talking and of course back then I wore a dress you know \u2018cause, you know, ladies had to be, like, dressed up, and I had a very conservative dress on, and B. F. Skinner touched my legs.  And I said, you may look at them, but you may not touch them and that ended that. And that is as he was showing me around the rat lab, I said, Dr. Skinner if we can just learn about the brain then we really would know some things. And Dr. Skinner says to me, we don't need to know anything about the brain, we have operant conditioning. And I just never really could accept that. You know, especially after taking Tom Evans' class at the same time. FLATOW: Mm hmm. And later on, you write, he just changed his mind totally on this. Dr. GRANDIN: Well, yes, Dr. Rady(ph) knew him after he had his stroke and he admitted that maybe he needed to get inside the black box and inside the brain. That yes, the brain did make a difference. But he had to have a stroke in order to realize that. FLATOW: Patricia in Santa Rosa, California, hi, welcome to Science Friday. PATRICIA (Caller): Hello, Dr. Grandin it is such an honor to be able to speak with you. I had read your book years ago, when I was working at a pre-school and I was really intrigued with your squeeze machine that you had developed. And I was so grateful to have read that because currently, I'm working with a boy who has high functioning autism or Asperger Disorder. And when I first started working with him I saw that he really needed some deep pressure, he kept hitting his head and he would crash his body into things, and have developed certain ways to have him use language to say how much pressure he needs, since we aren't able to make the squeeze machine. But, that has made a world of difference in working with him. Dr. GRANDIN: That's just wonderful and another thing where I'm getting very good reports on is therapeutic riding programs. I'm getting lots and lots of great reports from parents on, you know, how beneficial that's been for some children, too. PATRICIA: Yes, we tried, we considered doing the riding but he doesn't really like horses. Dr. GRANDIN: Okay, well the thing is\u2026 PATRICIA: But we have him do swimming and its amazing, he loves to go down as deep as he possibly can and stay down there for a moment and then shoot back up. Dr. GRANDIN: You know, different things work for different kids because the sensory problems are variable. Like I had auditory sensory problems and touch sensitivity problems, I had no problems with my vision. Other people absolutely cannot stand fluorescent lighting and they're sometimes helped by a thing called the Irlen colored glasses where you try on all kinds of different pale colored glasses until it's easier to read. It stops the problem of the print jiggling on the page. PATRICIA: How do you spell that? Dr. GRANDIN: It's Irlen, I-R-L-E-N. PATRICIA: Okay. FLATOW: Excellent. Dr. GRANDIN: You can also go to\u2026 FLATOW: Go ahead. Dr. GRANDIN: Sorry. FLATOW: Okay. Thank you for calling. PATRICIA: Oh, thank you so much. FLATOW: Have a good weekend and good luck to you. PATRICIA: Thank you. FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255, Dr. Grandin, you say that you almost never think in language that you think in pictures. So, it must be hard for you then to write books like this I would imagine. Dr. GRANDIN: Well, thinking in pictures is totally my writing. And then, of course, all my Scientific Journal articles I wrote. And my writing is much more technical, formal kind of writing and thinking in pictures has that. I wrote Animals in Translation with Catherine Johnson and Catherine Johnson's a super brilliant writer. She has two autistic kids, so she really knows autism. And she was able to write the book, making it like my voice. And, I really owe Catherine a lot. You know, it wouldn't have been a book without Catherine because my writing is much more formal. I've got a lot of stuff on my webpage, Grandin. com, that's all my writing. And I think I'm a good technical writer but I don't know how to write the way Catherine does. FLATOW: What would you like to do that you haven't been able to do so far in life? Dr. GRANDIN: Oh boy, that's a hard question. One thing I'd like to just keep on doing is I want to educate people about animal behavior and about autism. I've been doing autism talks for the last 20 years and there still are people out there that do not want to, they can't recognize that these sensory problems are real. That, for some of these kids when that fire alarm goes off, that really hurts the ears, it's a really real thing. FLATOW: Yeah. Well, we've been hearing a lot lately about an autism epidemic, what do you think about that? Dr. GRANDIN: I think the mild Aspergers have always been there. You see, Asperger's diagnosis did not become common in the U. S. until the early \u201890s. And an Aspergers has more or less normal speech development and they've always been here, that hasn't changed. I can think back to when I was in high school, this is 40 years ago, I could name kids in my high school class and college class that, today, would be diagnosed as Aspergers. When I go out in the meat industry, there's 40 and 50-year old undiagnosed Aspergers all over my industry, in good jobs like head of maintenance, drawing drawings, fixing equipment, a plant engineer.  FLATOW: Mm hmm.  Dr. GRANDIN: Now, where I think there may be an increase is in some of these more severe forms of autism, especially this type where the kid seems to appear to be normal and then at 18 months of age or so, he loses language. I call that the regressive type of autism and I think that segment's gone up. FLATOW: There's been a very vocal minority of people who are sure that autism, the rise in autism, has something to do with the mercury preservatives that used to be in vaccinations, where do you come down on that? Dr. GRANDIN: Well, there's actually been some research where they've managed to create some mice where, when they were given mercury at about the same level as vaccine, they would do some very autistic-like behaviors like biting the ends of their tails. You know, we also need to be watching out for mercury in flu shots given to pregnant moms. And now we get it out of the vaccine, we're going to have mercury in fish from power plant emissions.  FLATOW: Mm hmm.  Dr. GRANDIN: There's also other environmental contaminants that could get in there. I've been reading a lot of things in Science and Nature about endocrine disrupters. These are chemicals that mimic hormones, getting into the water supply and they're already causing some real abnormal things in fish. FLATOW: Mm hmm Are you talking about things that might get into a pregnant woman, in-utero, and causing things that show up later in life? Or things that happen from childhood after birth? Dr. GRANDIN: Well, I think, looking at the research, genetics is probably 60 to 70% of autism.  FLATOW: Mm hmm.  Dr. GRANDIN: And, in my case, I mean I'm old enough where I didn't get these vaccines, I'm young enough to have done anything to me. And my case would have been purely genetic. All the Aspergers around, you know, when I was a kid were purely genetic. But I think you might be getting some kind of susceptibility, you know, that goes with genetics, where maybe they have a very difficult time metabolizing some of these toxins out.  FLATOW: Right. Dr. GRANDIN: Or there's a genetic by environmental interaction. FLATOW: Talking this hour with Temple Grandin, author of Animals in Translation on Talk of the Nation Science Friday from NPR News. Let's see if we can get a couple of more calls in, if we can. Let's go to David in Iowa City, Iowa, hi, David. DAVID (Caller, Iowa City, Iowa): Hello, it's a pleasure, great pleasure to speak with you, Dr. Grandin. And I have a question about, you mentioned earlier in the show the difference between pattern thinking, people with autism with extraordinary music or math ability, versus picture thinking, which is how you've described your abilities. And, I'm curious to know whether there are, are you familiar with cases of people with autism who have extraordinary pattern thinking abilities, music, math, and through therapy or intensive instruction, have they been able to develop an extraordinary, or at least a normal, language ability, based on their pattern thinking ability?  Dr. GRANDIN: Well one thing that happened with me is they pounded away and pounded away in trying to teach me Algebra and that was just hopeless. And one of the mistakes made in my math education was not going on to trigonometry and geometry. Yes, you can do things, you know, like, we take somebody who's a poor visual thinker and you can work on improving their visual thinking. But you're never going to get them to my state, where they can, I do, I can look at a blueprint and I can do 3-D, you know, full motion video of that blueprint.  Dr. GRANDIN: You know, and I've been talking to people that are pattern thinkers and it's different for me. I was never very good at chess, that was, like, too abstract for me. You know, what I'm good at is something where I can manipulate photo-realistic pictures. And again, I want to emphasize the importance on building on a person's strength. We need to be thinking, when these kids are in junior high school, what are they going to do when they grow up? Because I look at the successful people that have, you know, high functioning autism and Asperger's, they're ones where maybe the parents were in the computer industry and they just taught the kids programming at, you know, age eight and nine and they just went on into the industry with their parents. FLATOW: So, you're worried about the future? Dr. GRANDIN: Well, we need to be, you know, I think some of the other countries, in some ways may be doing better than we're doing. I went to Japan, that was a little while ago and, I met a lot of Aspergers people over there and they all had decent jobs.  FLATOW: Can you train people to have decent jobs? Dr. GRANDIN: Yes, people have to learn social skills. I mean I had to learn social skills, like being in a play. And this is one advantage that being a child of the \u201850s was. All children in the \u201850s were taught manners, they were taught to say please and thank you, they were taught not to be rude. And I'm seeing some problems today where somebody's losing a job because they made fun of a fat lady that couldn't fit in the elevator. I mean that was the sort of thing that, when I was eight years old, my mother made it very clear to me that that was not okay to say that kind of stuff. FLATOW: Well, I want to wish you the best of luck, Dr. Grandin and I thank you very much for taking time to talk with us this hour. Dr. GRANDIN: Well, thank you so much for having me. FLATOW: You're welcome. Temple Grandin, Associate Professor of Animal Science at Colorado State University in Fort Collins. Her latest book is Animals in Translation: Using the Mysteries of Autism to Decode Animal Behavior. A terrific read, I highly recommend it.   FLATOW: I'm Ira Flatow this is TALK OF THE NATION SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.  (Soundbite of music)  FLATOW: You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow. For the rest of the hour, a look inside the often mysterious world of autism through the eyes of someone who has made a career out of overcoming the roadblocks the illness put in her way.  Temple Grandin doesn't see the world like most of us do. She does, she would say, see the world more like most animals: a place of fear without emotion where your thoughts come to you in pictures rather than in words.  Temple Grandin is autistic. Her writings about her struggles with autism, her fear, her anxiety, the overwhelming sensation of smell and sound, provide an intriguing glimpse into the world of autistic people.  Because of her autism Dr. Grandin says she can understand how animals see the world in a way that most humans cannot. She has written about her experiences with autism and her observations of animals in many books.  You may remember her Thinking in Pictures. Well, her latest book is Animals In Translation. She now joins us.  Let me formally introduce her. Temple Grandin is an Associate Professor of Animal Science at Colorado State University in Fort Collins. Animals in Translation: Using the Mysteries of Autism to Decode Animal Behavior is co-authored with Katherine Johnson. She joins us from studies of KPBS in San Diego.  Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY, Dr. Grandin.  Dr. TEMPLE GRANDIN (Colorado State University):  It's good to be here.  FLATOW: How has your book been received?  Dr. GRANDIN: Well, there's been a lot of interest in it. I was really happy to say that we're making some of the bestseller lists.  But let's get into talking about how autism is similar animal behavior. The thing is I don't think in a language and animals don't think in a language. It's sensory based thinking, thinking in pictures, thinking in smells, thinking in touches. It's putting these sensory based memories into categories. That's the basis of how an animal would think. One thing I want to say is, animals do have emotion. But fear tends to be one of the most primal emotions.  FLATOW: So you don't read animals minds, don't want our listeners to confuse that?  Dr. GRANDIN: No. And I always get asked all the time about animal communicators and I really don't want to get into a discussing whether ESP exists or not. Let's just stick with, you know, the other more concrete things.  FLATOW: Mm hmm. Yeah.  Dr. GRANDIN: Because that's how I think.  FLATOW: Yeah.  Dr. GRANDIN: I think in most cases, a lot of these animal communicators are very good animal behavior people. And a lot of them are visual thinkers and their picking up very subtle body cues from the animal.  You know, it's crouching down a little bit, it's moving around little bit differently. They're just very good at reading animal behavior. And I think in most cases that can explain some of their successes.  FLATOW: And why do you think your autism allows you to understand how animals think?  Dr. GRANDIN: Well to understand animal thinking you've got to get away from a language. See my mind works like Google for images. You put in a key word; it brings up pictures. See language for me narrates the pictures in my mind. When I work on designing livestock equipment I can test run that equipment in my head like 3-D virtual reality. In fact, when I was in college I used to think that everybody was able to do that. And language just sort of, you know, gives an opinion. Like, oh, that's a good idea or oh, I just figured out how to design that.  Language is not actually used in the actual designing process that is all done in pictures.  FLATOW: Mm hmm. When did you first discover that you could do this? That you could understand how animals think?  Dr. GRANDIN: Well, the thing is, I thought everybody thought in pictures. When I was in high school and college, I thought everybody could think in pictures. And my first inkling to my thinking was even different was when I was in college and I read an article about you know, some scientist said that the caveman could not have designed tools until they had language.  And then when I did Thinking in Pictures I started interviewing people in detail about how they thought. And that really gave me insight into how my thinking was different. And that some people think much more in words. And then I'm thinking, well, that has to be how an animal would think. There's no other way an animal could possibly think.  FLATOW: And so you've been able to design a device that animals will readily use as where other people have failed? Because you can think \u2026  Dr. GRANDIN: Well, back\u2026  FLATOW: \u2026how they think?  Dr. GRANDIN: The first thing I thought about is how they see. I mean, I'd read in my physiology books that, when I was in college, that cattle had 360-degree vision. And I was out in the feed yards in Arizona back in the 1970s. And, you know, some of the cows would just walk up the shoots to get their vaccinations. Other cattle would refuse to go through the shoots.  So I got down in the shoots to take pictures of what the cattle were seeing. And people thought that was just kind of crazy. And I found that they were afraid of shadows. They were afraid of a reflection off the bumper of a truck. They were afraid of seeing people up ahead. And if you remove these visual-based details, then the cattle would walk right up the shoot. In the beginning when I first started doing that, I mean people just couldn't even see why I was doing it.  FLATOW: Yeah, you write in your book about how you've noticed that animals do not like to stand with their legs crossed or feet together. And that some of the pens were forcing them to do that and you designed that out of it.  Dr. GRANDIN: Well, that's getting into the restrainer systems that I designed in the 1990s. I designed a system holding a cattle in the meat plant, where they straddle a conveyor. And if you get things set up right they just walk in really quietly.  And you've got to get the lighting right. They're afraid of the dark. If the lights were going, blasting in their eyes like the sun or there's a reflection on a shinny piece of metal moving, they're going to be afraid of that. And you get rid of those things their afraid of then their going to walk right in.  You know, the things that scare a prey/species animal like cattle are a whole lot of little visual details that people just don't tend to notice. And one of the big problems they used to have is the people just wanted to get out there and yell and scream and push and shove and you know more and more prods. Rather than remove the things that the cattle were afraid of.  FLATOW: You also talk about animals having special talents. Like special talents autistic people may have.  Dr. GRANDIN: Well some autistic people have savant skills. All autistic people do not have savant skills. Autism is a very variable disorder varying all the way from Einstein, emollient scientist, just a little bit of the trait, many scientist and engineers, down to somebody that's going to remain nonverbal.  There is a small segment of people with autism that have savant skills, where they can memorize entire maps of whole entire city. They can do calendar calculations. And this is similar to some of the skills that animals have.  Take bird migration for example. You know a Canada goose only has to be shown the route once and then he remembers the way. And this is sensory based memory. Because if you take a carrier pigeon and you take it somewhere and let it go and then it comes back home again. It remembers the things it sees and smells along the way.  FLATOW: Yeah.  Dr. GRANDIN: But if you put him in a smell-proof, vision-proof box, he's not going to find his way back home.  FLATOW: Right. What about the special powers we think animals have. For example sensory powers, they can predict or when an earthquake is coming. We hear stories during the Tsunami that the animals knew enough to get out of the way in advance.  Dr. GRANDIN: Well, I think their hearing, you know, low frequency sounds you know as the tidal wave was coming in. I mean their just, animals have very sensitive hearing. And they're hearing those sounds and they're trying to move away from them basically.  FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255, 1-800-989-TALK. Mike Inifik(ph) in New York, hi, welcome.  MIKE (Caller): Hi, hi Ira, hi Dr. Grandin, very nice to get a chance to talk to you. First time I was aware of your existence is when you were on Terry Gross's program. And I was thinking holy mackerel, this persons mind works a lot the way mine does. And I read an article about Asperger's syndrome came out of the New York Times. And a friend of mine showed it to me and said this describes me all over.  So I got a bit curious about it and I read the Curious Incidents of the Dog in The Night Time, which is a semi autobiographical account. And I became interested in it and I found a fascinating web site. And I'm wondering if you're aware of it, it's by some one named Andrew Lahman L-A-H-M-A-N and maybe two N's and it's called Origins of Autism. It's either originsofautism. com, or dot org.  And in this he presents the hypothesis that autism is in fact an adaptation, not a disorder. That it can go wrong, but when it goes right it enables people to be more predisposed to have certain kinds of occupations. It's a predisposition not a predetermination. Any person can get any king of occupation. But that autistic people tend to be particularly predisposed to do better at certain occupations that include science, inventing, music, dancing, the visual arts and things like this.  While people who aren't autistic tend to do better at more practical jobs, not that each can't do the other's jobs. But they do better with the job their body and brain is more adapted to. And he argued that this adaptation evolved at the time that the Bonobos separated from the chimp. He argues that the Bonobo separated from the regular chimp and then the Bonobo predicated into the Bonobos of today.  FLATOW: Mm hmm.  Dr. GRANDIN: I would\u2026  FLATOW: Go ahead.  Dr. GRANDIN: You know, I think that autistic brains tend to be specialized brains. Autistic people tend to be less social. It takes a ton of processor space in the brain to have all the social circuits. I mean after all, the first stone spear was not designed by the totally social people.  Let me just tell you about some research. Some of Simon Baron Cohan's research in England showed that there's two and a half times as many engineers in the family history of the people with autism.  I feel very strongly that if you got rid of all of the autistic genetics you're not going to have any scientists. There'd be no computer people. You'd lose a lot of artists and musicians. There'd be a horrible price to pay.  It's like a little bit of the autistic trait can give some advantages. You get too much of the autistic trait then you get a very severe handicap where the person's going to remain non-verbal. It's a continuum from a severe handicap all the way up to something where it's a personality variant. There's no black and white dividing line between a mild Aspergers, which is the mild autism, and computer engineer, for example.  FLATOW: Mm hmm, mm hmm. What do you want people to know or understand most about autistic people? What do you think is most misunderstood about them?  Dr. GRANDIN: Well, it's a lot of things that are misunderstood. One of the things I want to mention is if you see a child with autistic-like behaviors at age two and three, the worst thing you can do is just let them sit and watch TV all day. That's just the worst thing you can do. You need to have a teacher working with that child, working on teaching language, working on social interaction, working on getting them interested in different things, and keeping their brain connected to the world.  Autism is a neurological disorder. It's not caused by bad parenting. It's caused by, you know, abnormal development in the brain. The emotional circuits in the brain are abnormal. And there also are differences in the white matter, which is the brain's computer cables that hook up the different brain departments. This is the research of Dr. Eric Corshane(ph) out in San Diego. In fact, in my new edition of Thinking in Pictures, I review this research.  FLATOW: Mm hmm. 1-800-989-8255 is our number. Temple, you credit much of your success to a high school science teacher. Tell us about that, please.  Dr. GRANDIN: Yes. Yes, Mr. Carlock(ph). I was a goof-around student who just wasn't interested in school, just didn't want to study, totally bored with school. High school was a disaster. I got kicked out of a large girls' school because I threw a book at a girl after she teased me. And I was sent away to a special boarding school for emotionally disturbed children.  You've got to remember, this is the \u201860s. And so they now know that autism's not an emotional disturbance. But they didn't know that in the \u201860s. And I was still a goof-around student. Now, they had horseback riding. That was one of my favorite things to do. We had model rocket club. We had electronics club. These were all activities where I could get away from teasing and get in with other students where I had shared interests, you know.  FLATOW: Mm hmm.  Dr. GRANDIN: People with autism aren't interested in social chit-chat. And Mr. Carlock, I mean, took my interests and used that as a way to motivate me to study science. And I mean Mr. Carlock was an extremely important mentor in helping me to develop. And when you look at, let's look at the people with the milder forms of autism that are successful. They have their area of strength, you know, built-up on. I have a career that involves using my visual thinking skill for designing. And then mentor teachers, another really, really important thing because the autistic brain tends to be a specialist brain, good at one thing, bad at something else.  I'm a visual thinker, really bad at algebra. There's others that are a pattern thinker. These are the music and math minds. They think in patterns instead of pictures. Then there's another type that's not a visual thinker at all, and they're the ones that memorize all of the sports statistics, all of the weather statistics. It's kind of a language-logic mind.  FLATOW: Mm hmm. 1-800-989-8255 is our number. We're talking with Dr. Temple Grandin, author now out in paperback, Animals in Translation on Talk of the Nation Science Friday from NPR News.  Hey, is that what you mean when you say about normal people not being detail-oriented like the way you are and animals are?  Dr. GRANDIN: Well, the thing is, my thinking is sensory-detailed oriented. You can also have details of words, and there's some details of words that I don't, I'm not very good at. But I'm talking about sensory detail, visual detail, detail of some little small sound. I mean, think of all the smell detail that the dog gets. I mean, he checks out the local fire hydrant and he knows who's been there, when they were there, how long ago they were there, and are they friend or foe. That's a lot of information on the fire hydrant just from different smells.  FLATOW: Yes. They have to be detail-oriented because that's how they survive.  Dr. GRANDIN: And it's also how they think. And animals actually, you know, can solve problems under new conditions. And how do you have a think in pictures? Well, you have to sort the pictures into categories. You know, for example, a dog knows that, you know, there's good people and there's bad people. And I talked to a lady the other day where her dog was afraid of people with white beards because she had adopted him from an animal shelter and somebody with a white beard had abused him. And this dog was now afraid of everybody that had a white beard. That was the bad category.  FLATOW: Mm hmm, mm hmm. I think a lot of people are surprised when they hear you speak and read your writings about your knowledge about how animals think, your sensitivity to their feelings, to learn that you're not a vegetarian.  Dr. GRANDIN: No, I played around with vegetarianism back in the \u201870s. One thing, my physiology just got to have animal protein. I get hypoglycemic, I get all light-headed unless I eat animal protein.  And I did a lot of thinking about this and I've designed a lot of equipment for meat plants. The cattle would have never been foreign, you know, if we hadn't raised them. And I feel very strongly, we've got to give animals a good life. I've worked really hard improving slaughter plants and animal handling and transport. And people have said to me, why don't you work on improving conditions on pig farms? And basically, to be effective on making real change out there on the ground, you can only work on so many things. You know, you get too distributed, you're not effective. And, you know, I've got my one area I work in and I want to educate people about autism and I also want to improve, you know, animal handling and transport and make a real change out in the field on the ground.  FLATOW: Do you have a project you're working on someplace in the country?  Dr. GRANDIN: Well, right now I've been just non-stop travel with speaking engagements.  FLATOW: Yeah.  Dr. GRANDIN: At the age of 58 years old, you kind of get to the point in your career where I want to pass my knowledge on. And I've got two big projects coming up. I'm going to be visiting two different universities for a week. I'm going to Cornell University in February as a visiting professor and give talks on animal handling. And I'm kind of at the point where I want to like, you know, pass my knowledge on.  FLATOW: Yeah. Do you talk to the vets at the vet school there?  Dr. GRANDIN: Yes. In fact, I've got a meeting lined up with North Carolina State University at their veterinary school. And I'll be talking to the veterinary students at Cornell.  FLATOW: Do you think it's necessary for them to learn about animals before they become vets?  Dr. GRANDIN: Well, there's a lot, you know, there's a lot of things to animal behavior that vets need to learn about. I mean, just the other day they thought my, I have an assistant named Mark, and we thought that his dog might have a bladder infection. And the vet wanted to take poor Red Dog and throw her on her back and stretch her out on the exam table, no sedatives or anything, stick a needle into her belly for a urine sample.  FLATOW: Mm hmm.  Dr. GRANDIN: And I said that's too traumatic a thing to do to Red Dog. She's a very, very high-strung dog, and she's likely to be traumatized by that. We're not going to do that. We need a urine sample. We'll get her to pee in a cup.  FLATOW: Yeah. That's good, that could\u2026  DR. GRANDIN: We're not going to traumatize her putting her on her back.  FLATOW: All right. Stay with us, Dr. Grandin, and everybody wanting to speak with Dr. Grandin, with Temple Grandin. We're going to take a short break and come right back. Don't go away.  I'm Ira Flatow. This is Talk of the Nation Science Friday from NPR News.  You're listening to Talk of the Nation Science Friday from NPR News. I'm Ira Flatow. We're talking this hour about autism with my guest, Dr. Temple Grandin, Associate Professor of Animal Science at Colorado State University in Fort Collins.  Her latest book out in paperback, Animals in Translation: Using the Mysteries of Autism to Decode Animal Behavior. Our number, 1-800-989-8255. Let's go to the phones.  Let's go to Joel in Sacramento. Hi, Joel.  JOEL (caller): Hello there. It's a privilege to talk to you both. My question is based on the fact that my mother works with autistic students in junior high school and has a difficult challenge because she works in teaching them English, reading, and sometimes math. And the problem that she's observed, and perhaps, Doctor, you may have a comment on this based on your personal experience or study, is the students will often display just outward, to her it seems to be out of nowhere, just this terrible fear. They get terrified and she cannot get through to them to the point where often they have to be taken out of the class. And would you, perhaps, have one or two simple suggestions that my mother could use in calming a student down and directing them to the lesson? Or maybe we're looking at this all wrong.  Dr. GRANDIN: Okay. Let's talk about the fear problem. Fear was my main emotion until I started taking anti-depressant medication. And I was one of the people where, as I got older, the fear got worse and worse. So I can really relate to an animal getting, you know, scared and traumatized. Some of these fears these students have are sensory based. You know, when I was a little kid and the school bell went off, it hurt my ears like a dentist drill. You know, maybe the kid sees a cell phone and the ring on that cell phone hurts that kid's ears.  So, if he just sees that cell phone he's going to panic because it's a dangerous thing that might go off. Things like microphones are dangerous things because you never know when they might feedback and squeal. There's a lot of different things that can set off this fear reaction. And I would probably need to talk to your wife a whole lot more to figure out just which situations they're getting the fear reaction in. But a lot of this is sensory.  And an adult or a child that has a tantrum and just goes ballistic every time you take him in a big supermarket, that is usually due to sensory overload. They may not be able to tolerate smells in the detergent aisle, the fluorescent lights flicker and make the supermarket look like a discoth\u00e8que, or it may be just noise overload and they feel like they're inside the speaker at the rock and roll concert. But these sensory problems are very variable from really mild to just overwhelmingly bad.  FLATOW: All right. Good luck, Joel.  JOEL: Thank you. We'll take that and see if we can figure out what it is that is really upsetting them and perhaps remove that from them.  FLATOW: Thank you.  Dr. GRANDIN: Yes. We need to\u2026  JOEL: I'll relay that to my mother. Thank you.  FLATOW: Good luck.  Dr. GRANDIN: I'm sorry. It's your mother. Okay. I'm sorry.  FLATOW: Dr. Grandin, what was it that you did that you were able to overcome? You mentioned some medication you were using? What point did you say I'm going to overcome these fears and these obstacles?  Dr. GRANDIN: Well, the thing is, autism is all different, you know, variables. And you start out with a certain amount of, you know, the point where the differences in the brain are going to just be a personality variant and, like, for very mild Asperger's.  FLATOW: Mm hmm.  Dr. GRANDIN: But you get into more severe kinds of autism where there's obvious speech delay, obvious abnormal behavior in a two and three-year-old child, you know, the initial neurology is different from case to case. But all children with autism are going to do better if they get really good educational intervention. And there's a lot of controversy as to which programs you use. I have found that the most important thing is a good teacher. Some teachers just know how to work with a child and get progress and others don't. And you need lots of hours with a good teacher in these really young kids.  FLATOW: Mm hmm. 1-800-989-8255 is our number. Let's talk for a bit about something you designed, and was very interesting to read about, called a squeeze machine.  Dr. GRANDIN: Okay.  FLATOW: Tell us about your squeeze machine.  Dr. GRANDIN: Well, when I, when puberty hit, that's when the anxiety attacks and the panic attacks started. I was a type of person with autism where once there was puberty, non-stop panic attacks. I mean, imagine how you felt when you did your first really big, important, you know, interview, how nervous you were. Now, imagine if that's the way you felt all the time, all the time. Now, there's other people with Asperger's and autism that don't get nervous. This is where, you know, autism can be very variable.  And I was watching cattle go through a squeeze chute for their vaccinations. It's a device they put the cattle in to hold them still. And I noticed that some of the cattle just kind of relaxed. So I went and tried out the squeeze chute. And the pressure calmed me down. Many individuals with autism find that deep pressure applied over large areas of the body has a very, very calming effect on the nervous system. So then I built a squeezing machine that I could get into that worked with an air cylinder and an air compressor where I could work a little control handle and I could squeeze myself. And I used that to calm down.  Now, as I got into my 20s, my anxiety got worse and worse and worse. And in early 30s I went on antidepressant medication. I would not be here today if I hadn't gone on that medication. But, you know, exercise is another thing that's also very calming but, you know, this is common, the pressure seeking\u2026  FLATOW: Do you still have your squeezebox?  Dr. GRANDIN: I still have my squeezebox, yes I do.  FLATOW: Yeah, okay, 1-800-989-8255 is our number. While we get people on the phone I want to also ask you about meeting and studying B. F. Skinner. We all, I mean I'm a contemporary of yours, probably about the same age. I remember in college in the \u201860s, all I studied was B. F. Skinner and his white rats in the boxes, running mazes and things. You write a lot about that and also about meeting him.  Dr. GRANDIN: Well, I want to start out that I was lucky in the \u201860s to also be taking a class in Classical Ethology by a professor named Tom Evans, where I learned that operant conditioning does not explain all animal behavior. He explained how fixed action patterns and hardwired instinctual behavior works. And I remember going on a visit to Dr. Skinner and I felt like I was visiting, you know, the grand temple of psychology. And I went up to his office and, you know, he seemed, I'm like, oh, you mean he's actually an ordinary person? And we got to talking and of course back then I wore a dress you know \u2018cause, you know, ladies had to be, like, dressed up, and I had a very conservative dress on, and B. F. Skinner touched my legs.   And I said, you may look at them, but you may not touch them and that ended that. And that is as he was showing me around the rat lab, I said, Dr. Skinner if we can just learn about the brain then we really would know some things. And Dr. Skinner says to me, we don't need to know anything about the brain, we have operant conditioning. And I just never really could accept that. You know, especially after taking Tom Evans' class at the same time.  FLATOW: Mm hmm. And later on, you write, he just changed his mind totally on this.  Dr. GRANDIN: Well, yes, Dr. Rady(ph) knew him after he had his stroke and he admitted that maybe he needed to get inside the black box and inside the brain. That yes, the brain did make a difference. But he had to have a stroke in order to realize that.  FLATOW: Patricia in Santa Rosa, California, hi, welcome to Science Friday.  PATRICIA (Caller): Hello, Dr. Grandin it is such an honor to be able to speak with you. I had read your book years ago, when I was working at a pre-school and I was really intrigued with your squeeze machine that you had developed. And I was so grateful to have read that because currently, I'm working with a boy who has high functioning autism or Asperger Disorder. And when I first started working with him I saw that he really needed some deep pressure, he kept hitting his head and he would crash his body into things, and have developed certain ways to have him use language to say how much pressure he needs, since we aren't able to make the squeeze machine. But, that has made a world of difference in working with him.  Dr. GRANDIN: That's just wonderful and another thing where I'm getting very good reports on is therapeutic riding programs. I'm getting lots and lots of great reports from parents on, you know, how beneficial that's been for some children, too.  PATRICIA: Yes, we tried, we considered doing the riding but he doesn't really like horses.  Dr. GRANDIN: Okay, well the thing is\u2026  PATRICIA: But we have him do swimming and its amazing, he loves to go down as deep as he possibly can and stay down there for a moment and then shoot back up.  Dr. GRANDIN: You know, different things work for different kids because the sensory problems are variable. Like I had auditory sensory problems and touch sensitivity problems, I had no problems with my vision. Other people absolutely cannot stand fluorescent lighting and they're sometimes helped by a thing called the Irlen colored glasses where you try on all kinds of different pale colored glasses until it's easier to read. It stops the problem of the print jiggling on the page.  PATRICIA: How do you spell that?  Dr. GRANDIN: It's Irlen, I-R-L-E-N.  PATRICIA: Okay.  FLATOW: Excellent.  Dr. GRANDIN: You can also go to\u2026  FLATOW: Go ahead.  Dr. GRANDIN: Sorry.  FLATOW: Okay. Thank you for calling.  PATRICIA: Oh, thank you so much.  FLATOW: Have a good weekend and good luck to you.  PATRICIA: Thank you.  FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255, Dr. Grandin, you say that you almost never think in language that you think in pictures. So, it must be hard for you then to write books like this I would imagine.  Dr. GRANDIN: Well, thinking in pictures is totally my writing. And then, of course, all my Scientific Journal articles I wrote. And my writing is much more technical, formal kind of writing and thinking in pictures has that. I wrote Animals in Translation with Catherine Johnson and Catherine Johnson's a super brilliant writer. She has two autistic kids, so she really knows autism. And she was able to write the book, making it like my voice. And, I really owe Catherine a lot. You know, it wouldn't have been a book without Catherine because my writing is much more formal. I've got a lot of stuff on my webpage, Grandin. com, that's all my writing. And I think I'm a good technical writer but I don't know how to write the way Catherine does.  FLATOW: What would you like to do that you haven't been able to do so far in life?  Dr. GRANDIN: Oh boy, that's a hard question. One thing I'd like to just keep on doing is I want to educate people about animal behavior and about autism. I've been doing autism talks for the last 20 years and there still are people out there that do not want to, they can't recognize that these sensory problems are real. That, for some of these kids when that fire alarm goes off, that really hurts the ears, it's a really real thing.  FLATOW: Yeah. Well, we've been hearing a lot lately about an autism epidemic, what do you think about that?  Dr. GRANDIN: I think the mild Aspergers have always been there. You see, Asperger's diagnosis did not become common in the U. S. until the early \u201890s. And an Aspergers has more or less normal speech development and they've always been here, that hasn't changed. I can think back to when I was in high school, this is 40 years ago, I could name kids in my high school class and college class that, today, would be diagnosed as Aspergers. When I go out in the meat industry, there's 40 and 50-year old undiagnosed Aspergers all over my industry, in good jobs like head of maintenance, drawing drawings, fixing equipment, a plant engineer.   FLATOW: Mm hmm.   Dr. GRANDIN: Now, where I think there may be an increase is in some of these more severe forms of autism, especially this type where the kid seems to appear to be normal and then at 18 months of age or so, he loses language. I call that the regressive type of autism and I think that segment's gone up.  FLATOW: There's been a very vocal minority of people who are sure that autism, the rise in autism, has something to do with the mercury preservatives that used to be in vaccinations, where do you come down on that?  Dr. GRANDIN: Well, there's actually been some research where they've managed to create some mice where, when they were given mercury at about the same level as vaccine, they would do some very autistic-like behaviors like biting the ends of their tails. You know, we also need to be watching out for mercury in flu shots given to pregnant moms. And now we get it out of the vaccine, we're going to have mercury in fish from power plant emissions.   FLATOW: Mm hmm.   Dr. GRANDIN: There's also other environmental contaminants that could get in there. I've been reading a lot of things in Science and Nature about endocrine disrupters. These are chemicals that mimic hormones, getting into the water supply and they're already causing some real abnormal things in fish.  FLATOW: Mm hmm Are you talking about things that might get into a pregnant woman, in-utero, and causing things that show up later in life? Or things that happen from childhood after birth?  Dr. GRANDIN: Well, I think, looking at the research, genetics is probably 60 to 70% of autism.   FLATOW: Mm hmm.   Dr. GRANDIN: And, in my case, I mean I'm old enough where I didn't get these vaccines, I'm young enough to have done anything to me. And my case would have been purely genetic. All the Aspergers around, you know, when I was a kid were purely genetic. But I think you might be getting some kind of susceptibility, you know, that goes with genetics, where maybe they have a very difficult time metabolizing some of these toxins out.   FLATOW: Right.  Dr. GRANDIN: Or there's a genetic by environmental interaction.  FLATOW: Talking this hour with Temple Grandin, author of Animals in Translation on Talk of the Nation Science Friday from NPR News. Let's see if we can get a couple of more calls in, if we can. Let's go to David in Iowa City, Iowa, hi, David.  DAVID (Caller, Iowa City, Iowa): Hello, it's a pleasure, great pleasure to speak with you, Dr. Grandin. And I have a question about, you mentioned earlier in the show the difference between pattern thinking, people with autism with extraordinary music or math ability, versus picture thinking, which is how you've described your abilities. And, I'm curious to know whether there are, are you familiar with cases of people with autism who have extraordinary pattern thinking abilities, music, math, and through therapy or intensive instruction, have they been able to develop an extraordinary, or at least a normal, language ability, based on their pattern thinking ability?   Dr. GRANDIN: Well one thing that happened with me is they pounded away and pounded away in trying to teach me Algebra and that was just hopeless. And one of the mistakes made in my math education was not going on to trigonometry and geometry. Yes, you can do things, you know, like, we take somebody who's a poor visual thinker and you can work on improving their visual thinking. But you're never going to get them to my state, where they can, I do, I can look at a blueprint and I can do 3-D, you know, full motion video of that blueprint.   Dr. GRANDIN: You know, and I've been talking to people that are pattern thinkers and it's different for me. I was never very good at chess, that was, like, too abstract for me. You know, what I'm good at is something where I can manipulate photo-realistic pictures. And again, I want to emphasize the importance on building on a person's strength. We need to be thinking, when these kids are in junior high school, what are they going to do when they grow up? Because I look at the successful people that have, you know, high functioning autism and Asperger's, they're ones where maybe the parents were in the computer industry and they just taught the kids programming at, you know, age eight and nine and they just went on into the industry with their parents.  FLATOW: So, you're worried about the future?  Dr. GRANDIN: Well, we need to be, you know, I think some of the other countries, in some ways may be doing better than we're doing. I went to Japan, that was a little while ago and, I met a lot of Aspergers people over there and they all had decent jobs.   FLATOW: Can you train people to have decent jobs?  Dr. GRANDIN: Yes, people have to learn social skills. I mean I had to learn social skills, like being in a play. And this is one advantage that being a child of the \u201850s was. All children in the \u201850s were taught manners, they were taught to say please and thank you, they were taught not to be rude. And I'm seeing some problems today where somebody's losing a job because they made fun of a fat lady that couldn't fit in the elevator. I mean that was the sort of thing that, when I was eight years old, my mother made it very clear to me that that was not okay to say that kind of stuff.  FLATOW: Well, I want to wish you the best of luck, Dr. Grandin and I thank you very much for taking time to talk with us this hour.  Dr. GRANDIN: Well, thank you so much for having me.  FLATOW: You're welcome. Temple Grandin, Associate Professor of Animal Science at Colorado State University in Fort Collins. Her latest book is Animals in Translation: Using the Mysteries of Autism to Decode Animal Behavior. A terrific read, I highly recommend it.

The fossil was discovered four decades ago, but has been in storage ever since. From Nebraska, Public Radio's Sarah McCammon reports. Ms. SARAH MCCAMMON (Reporter/Producer, NET Radio): In 1962 in the Nebraska panhandle a pair of workmen stumbled on a large thigh bone while installing an electric line on a ranch. That summer, 20-year-old paleontology student Mike Voorhies was in the area working on a fossil dig. After working at the site for a couple days, Voorhies and his crew realized the men had found the intact remains of an entire Ice-Age mammoth. Mr. MICHAEL VOORHIES (Curator of Vertebrate Paleontology, UNL): And then once we got to the skull, it turned out, well, there's one tusk, there's two tusks. Uh, oh, three tusks; what's going on here?  Even a young student realizes an elephant only has two tusks. So it gradually dawned on us that we actually had two animals locked in a death struggle. And probably the most exciting single fossil that I've ever seen. Ms. MCCAMMON: Mike Voorhies is now in his sixties and Curator of Paleontology at the University of Nebraska in Lincoln. And the mammoths, after decades of being in storage and viewed almost exclusively by researchers, are being prepared to travel four hundred miles west. Voorhies says there's no other known fossil quite like it anywhere in the world. The two mammoth's tusks are locked together, intertwined like a pair of twisted tree trunks. Mr. VOORHIES: It's actually the old story of they're fighting over sex. Ms. MCCAMMON: Like modern elephants, scientists believe male mammoths periodically produced extra testosterone which drove them to fight over mates. University of Michigan Professor Dan Fisher is studying the mammoth's tusks looking for clues about why their decedents went extinct. Fisher says they offer scientists a rare glimpse of fossilized animal behavior. Mr. DANIEL FISHER (Paleontologist, University of Michigan): To find multiple individuals as it were caught in the act of some interaction that was critical to their lifestyle, their existence on the planet, gives you just an extra dimension that isn't usually there. Ms. MCCAMMON: Voorhies, the paleontologist, says it appears the two competitors were so well matched that neither one backed down. Standing over the twelve-foot-long wooden pallet that supports the giant fossil, Voorhies points to the tip of one mammoth's tusk which pokes into the eye socket of its opponent. Mr. VOORHIES: These guys were not fooling around and there's the old adage in boxing that, you know, the bigger they are the harder they fall. You can just imagine two eight-ton animals sort of falling over and then not being able to get up. Ms. MCCAMMON: Today the tusks and skulls lie on the wood floor of the large fourth-floor room where they're being prepared for public exhibition. Using a knife and brush a museum worker is scraping off layers of old yellow shellac, revealing the off-white surface beneath. Voorhies admits he'll be a little sad to see the mammoths go. Mr. VOORHIES: We're standing in an area here that's, oh, I suppose a couple of hundred square feet and we've got these elephant bones all scattered out here. And in a few months those are gonna be gone. Ms. MCCAMMON: The exhibit is scheduled to open at museum near Crawford, Nebraska in April, giving the public what scientists say is a rare glimpse of animal behavior preserved in the fossil record for 20,000 years.

A New York City police detective who searched through the rubble just after the September 11th attacks on the World Trade Center died recently, and his death has renewed fears in New York that the air around Ground Zero could have been dangerous. Now other emergency personnel who worked there are asking for federal help. NPR's Robert Smith reports. ROBERT SMITH reporting: For years now, doctors have known about the World Trade Center cough, a raspy hacking from some of the workers who spent the weeks after September 11th looking through the debris. But over the last seven months, three of those workers have died of respiratory illnesses, 34 year old detective James Adroggo(ph), who family members say contracted black lung disease; paramedic Felix Hernandez who became so weak he could no longer climb stairs; and EMT Tim Keller. His son David says his father began coughing off bits of gravel soon after the attacks and died of a long list of respiratory issues. Mr. DAVID KELLER (Son of Rescue Worker): He had arterial sporadic heart disease, pulmonary emphysema, chronic asthmatic bronchitis and sleep apnea. SMITH: Is there any question that this is related to 9/11? Mr. KELLER: There shouldn't be any question. He was absolutely perfectly healthy before September 11th, and after that, it just went downhill. SMITH: At Ground Zero yesterday, rescue workers returned to the site to ask for federal assistance. Republican Congressman Vito Fossella stood before them and called for the appointment of a federal health czar to coordinate the diagnosis and care of these workers. Congressman VITO FOSSELLA (Republican, New York): Their deaths should be a clarion call to the entire Congress and the entire country to once and for all put somebody in charge to help those who need our help. SMITH: The problem is no one knows for sure if the air at Ground Zero after the attacks is responsible for the recent deaths. Certainly the environment was filled with dust, smoke and chemicals from the destruction of the Trade Center, and studies at Mount Sinai medical center have shown that about half of the 16,000 workers they've examined have some sort of ongoing medical problem, but no one has linked September 11th with the chronic illness and death. After all, respiratory disease is the fourth leading cause of death among everyone in the United States. Dr. Robyn(ph) Herbert of the Mount Sinai program says there hasn't been the funding or the leadership for a full study. Dr. ROBYN HERBERT (Mount Sinai): We know about a number of deaths really because of the vigorous work of the press, but there has not been a complete ascertainment of all deaths among World Trade Center responders, so I don't even really know how many people have in fact died who were down there. SMITH: Back at the World Trade Center site, to even ask about scientific proof will get you shouted down. Marvin Bufai(ph), a paramedic who works at Ground Zero, waved his medications in my face. Mr. MARVIN BUFAI (Paramedic): These are all my asthma medication right here. This is for my sinuses. This is for my high blood pressure, and this is for my anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder. So how can you say that we're not sick? How can you say that we're not hurt?

Up next this hour the science of Evo-Devo. Birds do it, bees do it, we do it. Turns out we all do it in a similar way. I'm talking about development. For years, scientists new very little about the process of development. They knew how it started with the meeting of sperm and egg; but how that one fertilized egg grew into a million celled or trillion celled organism was somewhat of a mystery, the black box of biology sort to speak. Well, new technologies developed in the last 20 years or so have allowed scientists to see what's happening in that black box. And they found that development in wildly different organisms is remarkably similar. By looking at the relatively small number of genes that control development, biologists say they can learn a lot about evolution. This new branch of biology even has the catchy title, which I've been using because I like to say it, Evo-Devo, for Evolutionary Developmental Biology. And joining me now to talk more about it is my guest Sean B. Carroll. He's an investigator with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and a professor of molecular biology at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. He's the author of Endless Forms Most Beautiful; the new science of Evo-Devo published by W. W. Norton last year. Thanks for talking with me today Dr. Carroll. Prof. SEAN B. CARROLL (Molecular Biology, University of Wisconsin): Thanks for having me, Joe. PALCA: So start me off. Did I kind of get it right about what Evo-Devo is? Prof. CARROLL: Yeah, you're right on the button. PALCA: Okay. Well, we can stop then, thanks very much. No I mean what's going on here? Why is this a new field of endeavor? Prof. CARROLL: Well, as you mentioned in the last 20 years we finally got a peak inside the black box of embryos. And I guess let me start with an analogy. If you consider the construction of a building what would it look like to us if we didn't see the workers and the machinery putting that together? It would look as though the building assembled itself or was put there by some magical force. Now that we can see the workers and the machinery, now we understand how things are put together. And now that we understand the making of an individual building, some particular species, we understand how differences in the way those workers and machinery put things together give you the different kinds of buildings that we see. In this case the different kinds of buildings that are different kinds of animals we see in the animal kingdom. PALCA: Ah, now I meant to invite our listeners to join this conversation. The number is 800-989-8255; that's 800-989-TALK. So okay. So you talk about a molecular tool kit for building, I mean, what exactly are we talking about there? Prof. CARROLL: Well, a small fraction of all the genes we have or any other animal has, are really devoted to organ building and body building. With the rest of the genes really carrying out basic physiological tasks like getting nutrients in and flushing things out or the specialized jobs of the types of cells we have, like those fore carrying oxygen or for fighting off invaders and things like this. But the building, the putting your backbone in place, deciding the number of vertebrae, the number of ribs, where the hands are going to go, how many digits, where do the eyes go, how many there will be, the color of fur or skin or scales or feathers. These are the tool kit genes. They are shaping the size, the number and the color of bodies and body parts. PALCA: So if these, if this idea that there's a relatively small tool kit that builds everything up from the same sort of set of principles. If that's the new idea what did people used to think? Prof. CARROLL: They used to think that really there was entirely different genetic recipe for different forms of organisms. It was an intuitive bias that we just didn't see the connection between say something like a tiny fruit fly and a magnificent human. Our expectations were that there would be entirely different rules and entirely different materials being used in assembling the bodies of these different animals. PALCA: So how does this idea square with you know what Darwin was talking about, about how different species evolve? Prof. CARROLL: Well, Darwin and many of his followers understood the importance of embryology to understanding evolution. But it was, as you said, a black box for really more than a century. So while everyone could agree that what was going on in embryos was important and Darwin felt that embryology was the best evidence and support of the evolution of forms, understanding that changes in development lead to changes in form. They knew that at a conceptual level but they didn't have any material understanding of it whatsoever. PALCA: So but this is the part that I always find I get a little confused at when I hear a description about something changing in the way we look at it. So okay, so if things didn't evolve independently but then these developmental genes have been sort of conserved all along from very simple organisms to more complex ones. PALCA: You still have to have something that says, Okay, what's controlling the tool kit to come up with the different form? Prof. CARROLL: Exactly, the operating instructions. PALCA: Right. Prof. CARROLL: So what we were expecting was that the genes themselves were changing. And we've been looking at genes and the genetic code for 40 years. And the expectation was with it sort of the inventory of tools used for building different animals would be different. But really what makes animals different, what makes us different from apes and apes different from other mammals, etcetera, is how the tool kit is used. Those operating instructions are also encoded in DNA, but they've been in a part of the DNA that we haven't spent much time. It is much harder to decode and decipher and this is really one of the current problems in biology is deciphering what I refer to as the dark matter of the gene gnome; the parts that have been harder to see but really have wired in there the instructions for how the tool kit is used. PALCA: Right. And so it seems as if since this what you call dark matter has been a relatively new object of attention in the genetic world. In fact we don't really know very much about the control mechanisms yet. Prof. CARROLL: No we don't. I don't want to say that we're you know lost, it's simply, it's much harder to study and we learn about it sort of piece by piece. The great thing about the genetic code is that we can read the genetic code of anything from a bacteria to a whale. It's the same code across all kingdoms. But the code for building bodies and how that's wired in is unique to each species. And so deciphering that code is a much tougher informational problem. PALCA: Okay why don't we let our listeners join in on this, because I just find it, I find it an interesting concept and I wonder well before I ask, I mean is it gaining wide acceptance? Has everybody said, Oh yes of course this has got to be it or are there still people saying, No, no this Evo-Devo is a fad and it's going to pass away? Prof. CARROLL: Well there maybe people who think it's a fad. I think everyone appreciate it. First of all understanding development was a huge quest for biology and it has great importance for example in the medical arena. So there has been tremendous solid progress in understanding the body building and organ building genes of everything from as I said fruit flies to humans. Now in terms of evolution, it's a really simple connection. Remodeling development is what gives you the evolution of form. So if you want to understand diversity of form, you have to understand how development changes. So Evo-Devo is here to stay. Understanding those subtle changes that take place in development that give us big brains or allow our posture to be upright or put our thumb where it is, these are things we're really going to want to understand. PALCA: Okay let's invite the listeners into the conversation. Our number is 800-989-8255, that's 800-989-TALK. And why don't we try Chris in Dekalb, Illinois. Chris welcome to Science Friday. CHRIS (Caller): Hi, Ira. PALCA: Well it's somebody like Ira, its Joe Palca today. CHRIS: Oh, I'm sorry. PALCA: Okay. CHRIS: My question is, okay in college in the early 90s when I was taking biology, we were taught the saying ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny. Which basically means that human embryos and higher mammal embryos go through stages which resemble the stages of evolution; is one point where the embryo (unintelligible) and it looks like fish gills. There's other points where it looks very much like a chicken embryo and so you know they were saying that we kind of retraced the steps of evolution as we develop as embryos. And then I heard later that that had been totally disproven and they really weren't gill slits after all. So I wanted to see what Evo-Devo has to say about that debate. PALCA: Cool question. Prof. CARROLL: Great question. Well Evo-Devo gives us whole new ways of testing questions like that, because we have new ways of seeing the events that go on in embryos and asking, Well are there repertoires of genes that are being used that we know for example are used in fish in a particular way. How are they used in a mammal for example? And the reason why ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny has been, it's such a catchy phrase but, and you then know there's a lot of sort of extra jeopardy words in there. But the reason why it has lost favor is we understand that evolution chucks all sorts of pieces of the developmental program. And that it's not a strict recapitulation of evolutionary history at all. There's a whole parts of development that are missing when one compares organisms, because as organisms change lifestyles and adapt to new habitats and, for example come to land versus water, things become dispensable and some things do disappear. The other part of development that evolves a great deal are the very earliest steps in, for example, the making of eggs in the early events in an egg. That's also very closely tied to lifestyle. So it's misleading to think very strictly about ontogeny meaning development recapitulating phylogeny, meaning evolutionary history. We see bits and pieces of that which are very fascinating. The little while we have a tail or the features that we have that resemble those of our aquatic sis- our aquatic ancestors. But it's not a strict recapitulation so it's really something that we're urging not be taught. PALCA, host: Okay, hey Chris thanks very much an interesting question. CHRIS (Caller): All right. Thank you. PALCA: Okay, you know that brings up the other question that I'm always perplexed by. Say you've got this little ball of cells that begins to grow and starts to take on shape and form. And obviously switches are switching on and off. If the, if the theory's right and there's this limited number of genes so there's some switch, switching going on. What makes the order work each time? I mean it seems like so much has to happen absolutely correctly to get from a two celled organism to an elephant. And you'd expect to have a lot of errors. Prof. CARROLL: Yeah, a lot does have to work right but nature's been working on this for 600 million years. So, and, and really worked out a lot of it in the first hundred million. There's. . . PALCA: It's a smart learner nature. Prof. CARROLL: Yeah, nature's very good because it weeds out all the losers so only those genomes that do this really well get to play in the next round. PALCA: Uh-hum. Prof. CARROLL: There is some variation, and without variation, there would be no evolution. So we know that the size and shape and color of, of characters that come out in various species do vary. We can see that among ourselves most easily if you just look at human faces, you can see that cheek structure and eye color and all sorts of features of the head are different; but between us, of course, we all belong to the human species. So all those differences are little variations in the process of development. So there is some tolerance in there. And the same sort of variation exists in other animal species. What natural selection plays with is that variation and if some of that variation is more useful than others, that's going to be favored as the form of those species and its descendants evolve. So you're right that there's an awful lot of switches, an awful lot of um, toggles that have to be thrown in the right order in the right timing so that things don't collapse. But that is what natural selection's really good at, which is preserving everything that works and allowing a little bit of tolerances into things to enable some variation. PALCA: Okay well we'll probably want to ask you some more on that question but I'm going to invite out listeners to join in the conversation. Our number is 800-989-8255. That's 800-989-TALK and uh, let's take, let's take number three here, Jock, in Philadelphia. Welcome to the program. JOCK (Caller): Uh, hello, I would like to make a quick comment and ask Sean Carroll a question. PALCA: Go ahead. JOCK: The, the comment is I want to thank you greatly for your wonderful book that I'm about halfway through; because it is, it's very understandable for someone not conversant with the field. And it's helping me understand what my daughter is doing, who recently changed her plans to go to medical school. And I learned two days ago has been accepted into the Evo-Devo Program at Washington University in St. Louis. PALCA: Well there you go. Prof. CARROLL: I want to point out that this is not a relative of mine making this call. (Soundbite of Laughter) PALCA: Okay. JOCK: It's a great book and I recommend it to anybody interested in science and particularly interested in informing themselves about the debate over evolution. The question I have is, using you science as a foundation, what do you predict will be possible in the way of translating this into clinical application in the practice of medicine in the future? PALCA: Okay great quest. . . JOCK: Like Genomics and, and that field is emerging as a powerful new discipline looking ahead. Thank you very much. PALCA: Great question Jock thanks. Quick answer? Prof. CARROLL: Yeah, great question and it gives me a great opportunity to explain the, the intimate connection here between development and, and human medicine. And so understanding those genes that determine which cells are going to be of which types and how organs grow and the identity of organs. These are the genes that we're going want to, for example, want to manipulate in with stem cell technology. So I thing that one of the things we're going to look forward to is a greater expansion of our power to regenerate tissues and uh, this will all play into the role of transplantation to repair organ damage, to replace damaged sun types and things like that. PALCA: Sean Carroll, I need to interrupt and say we're talking with Sean Carroll about the new science of Evo-Devo. I'm Joe Palca. And this is Talk of the Nation from NPR News. Okay let's take another call. Thanks for that answer. Let's go to Jeff in Jacksonville, Florida. Jeff welcome to the program. JEFF (Caller): Well thank you Mr. Palca. Doctor, um, real quick question. I was a diver in the Navy, and one of the, one of the tenets was that everything in the body is driven by partial pressures of various chemistries within out blood. I just wanted to know if there's, if there's anything, and I've often thought that it would be similar to what, what triggered the development of genes and the expression of genes in the partial pressures within each cell of the chemistry that's found in the amniotic fluid in a developing embryo? PALCA: Interesting. JEFF: Is that, is that, am I completely off base or is that, is that. . . Prof. CARROLL: Well development is going to run generally on different chemistry. It's really the chemistry of proteins interacting with DNA and the cells interacting with each other. So all of the things you mess, mention are physiologically important, but they don't drive the process of development per se. JEFF: Okay. PALCA: All Right. Thanks, thanks very much for that. Let's take one more quick call and go to uh, uh, Rhonda in Des Moines, Iowa. Rhonda go ahead. You're on the program. RHONDA (Caller): Hello. PALCA: Hi. RHONDA: I have always been intrigued that cloned animals aren't the same color or don't look like the animal they're cloned from. And I'm wondering if this has anything to do with that. PALCA: Huh, interesting. Rhonda thanks for that question. Sean Carroll? Prof. CARROLL: Great question. Cloned, you're speaking of cloned animals, Rhonda? PALCA: Yes. Prof. CARROLL: So the, the major technique for cloning of animals is to take the nucleus out of cell out of a typical body cell. Now that nucleus has gotten to that body cell, or gotten to that place through a long journey originally descended from an egg. There are changes that are taking place through that process that may not be reversible. And so while cloned animals can be generated for some species from individual body cells, there have been some irreversible changes taking place such that some of those body features don't come out the same way the next time around, from, from the cloned cell. That's why we see differences, for example in body size. We see some metabolic differences and some of the features determined by the sex of the animal are also variable. So it's a great question, a great observation and if I could extend that, this is why the scientific community is uniformly against the cloning of humans. . . PALCA: Okay well. . . Prof. CARROLL: . . . way, shape or form because of this tremendous risk that we don't understand about between the identity of clones. PALCA: Sean Carroll, Sean Carroll we have to take a short break. I'm Joe Palca and this is Talk of the Nation from NPR. (sound bite of music) PALCA: This from NPR News. This is Talk of the Nation Science Friday. I'm Joe Palca. We're talking with Sean Carroll. He's the author of Endless Forms Most Beautiful, the New Science of Evo-Devo. He's also an investigator with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and a professor of molecular biology genetics and medical genetics at the University of Wisconsin at Madison. And he's one of, well as his book title suggests, he's very involved in this new science of Evo-Devo. And we have a lot of interesting callers. So let's take one more. Let's go to Leah in Mansfield, Minnesota. Did I get that right Leah? LEAH (Caller): Mansfield, Massachusetts. PALCA: Oh well, wrong state. Anyway welcome to the program. What's your question? LEAH: My question is, there is so many holes in the theory of evolution. And part of all this theory was discarded, why don't we ask a question. Who created the whole mechanism to develop the one species not another? PALCA: Ahh. LEAH: My second question is, who made the possibility to evolve in our genes? PALCA: Okay. LEAH: And my third question, it's the last one. PALCA: Okay. LEAH: If there are so many holes and uncertainty about evolution, why scientist don't weigh the scientific question, and don't consider that uh, the possibility of the creation by intelligent, of intelligent creation? PALCA: Yeah. LEAH: And the possibility the world was not created on a random, but by design. PALCA: Well, I, those are all interesting questions and I think Sean Carroll, I'm, I'm guessing you've thought about this quite a bit. Prof. CARROLL: My credentials in theology are fairly thin, but let me go to the point about holes in the theory of, of evolution. I think it's really important to understand that as often as that phrase is repeated, um, there's not a lot of truth to it. The point being that for 150 years biologist, geologists, scientist of all sorts of stripes have been testing and expanding upon Darwin's picture of evolution and seeing it in more rich detail as the decade's past. What we see at the level of the DNA record. What we see in embryos. What we see with new fossil discoveries, is entirely consistent an independent lines of evidence of the fundamental truth that life evolved by natural processes. In terms of the beginning of life, scientists don't really understand the beginning of life. We have some ideas but there are many, many ideas and they're all pretty much wide open to testing. In terms of design at a higher level, I think I'll pass on that one, 'cause I think every citizen's entitled to, to concede their own idea of that. And science is generally silent on that point. PALCA: But I mean in your theory uh, doesn't it, isn't tempting to say okay uh, you know God made it work. Wasn't he so smart. He didn't reinvent the wheel for every different organism? Prof. CARROLL: Well, I, I see you can certainly, you know, you're entitled to that viewpoint. And if you look at the scientific evidence, you'll understand that the process of genetic variation and natural selection is sufficient to account for all the changes and forms that we see through three billion years of life's history on earth. And that the scientific community has no trouble understanding the connection between simple and complex. And that that process of going from simple to complex is repeated every time an egg is fertilized. And we don't think that you need any miraculous intervention to create a human from a single fertilized egg. We know that it's biochemistry and it's cells and it's a lot of processes that are entirely observable and experimentally accessible. And so we don't reach for the supernatural, when we think the natural is completely adequate. PALCA: Okay let's take one more call and go to Charles in Boulder, Colorado. Charles welcome to Science Friday. CHARLES (Caller): Hi. PALCA: Hi. CHARLES: I have a quick question. PALCA: Okay. CHARLES: I want to know the impact of this research of the classification of new organisms and species and if that applies or not? And I'll take my answer off the air. PALCA: Okay. Thanks. Prof. CARROLL: So um, Evo-Devo is allowing us to see some connections that we couldn't see before. And what it allows us to do, for example, is that tracing the origin of particular structures. And sometimes identifying some connection that were concealed by outward appearances being so different. So it is starting to have an impact on how we understand the relationships between members of the animal kingdom. And it's allowing us to see very deeply into the stuff that makes animals similar or different. So it's going to have a contribution and it's still a matter of time, 'til we understand maybe what some of the most dramatic uh, notions we overturn through this field are going to be. PALCA: All right. Well we've run out of time for this segment. I've like to thank my guest Sean Carroll. He's an investigator with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and a Professor of Molecular Biology at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. He's the author of Endless Forms Most Beautiful: The New Science of Evo-Devo.  JOE PALCA, host:  From NPR News this is Talk of the Nation Science Friday I'm Joe Palca. Up next this hour the science of Evo-Devo. Birds do it, bees do it, we do it. Turns out we all do it in a similar way. I'm talking about development. For years, scientists new very little about the process of development. They knew how it started with the meeting of sperm and egg; but how that one fertilized egg grew into a million celled or trillion celled organism was somewhat of a mystery, the black box of biology sort to speak.  Well, new technologies developed in the last 20 years or so have allowed scientists to see what's happening in that black box. And they found that development in wildly different organisms is remarkably similar. By looking at the relatively small number of genes that control development, biologists say they can learn a lot about evolution.  This new branch of biology even has the catchy title, which I've been using because I like to say it, Evo-Devo, for Evolutionary Developmental Biology. And joining me now to talk more about it is my guest Sean B. Carroll. He's an investigator with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and a professor of molecular biology at the University of Wisconsin, Madison.

The number is 800-989-8255; that's 800-989-TALK. So okay. So you talk about a molecular tool kit for building, I mean, what exactly are we talking about there?

CHRIS (Caller): Hi, Ira.  PALCA: Well it's somebody like Ira, its Joe Palca today.  CHRIS: Oh, I'm sorry.  PALCA: Okay.

Thank you.  PALCA: Okay, you know that brings up the other question that I'm always perplexed by. Say you've got this little ball of cells that begins to grow and starts to take on shape and form. And obviously switches are switching on and off. If the, if the theory's right and there's this limited number of genes so there's some switch, switching going on. What makes the order work each time? I mean it seems like so much has to happen absolutely correctly to get from a two celled organism to an elephant. And you'd expect to have a lot of errors.  Prof. CARROLL: Yeah, a lot does have to work right but nature's been working on this for 600 million years. So, and, and really worked out a lot of it in the first hundred million. There's. . .  PALCA: It's a smart learner nature.  Prof. CARROLL: Yeah, nature's very good because it weeds out all the losers so only those genomes that do this really well get to play in the next round.

So we know that the size and shape and color of, of characters that come out in various species do vary. We can see that among ourselves most easily if you just look at human faces, you can see that cheek structure and eye color and all sorts of features of the head are different; but between us, of course, we all belong to the human species.  So all those differences are little variations in the process of development. So there is some tolerance in there. And the same sort of variation exists in other animal species. What natural selection plays with is that variation and if some of that variation is more useful than others, that's going to be favored as the form of those species and its descendants evolve. So you're right that there's an awful lot of switches, an awful lot of um, toggles that have to be thrown in the right order in the right timing so that things don't collapse. But that is what natural selection's really good at, which is preserving everything that works and allowing a little bit of tolerances into things to enable some variation.  PALCA: Okay well we'll probably want to ask you some more on that question but I'm going to invite out listeners to join in the conversation. Our number is 800-989-8255. That's 800-989-TALK and uh, let's take, let's take number three here, Jock, in Philadelphia. Welcome to the program.  JOCK (Caller): Uh, hello, I would like to make a quick comment and ask Sean Carroll a question.  PALCA: Go ahead.  JOCK: The, the comment is I want to thank you greatly for your wonderful book that I'm about halfway through; because it is, it's very understandable for someone not conversant with the field. And it's helping me understand what my daughter is doing, who recently changed her plans to go to medical school. And I learned two days ago has been accepted into the Evo-Devo Program at Washington University in St. Louis.  PALCA: Well there you go.  Prof. CARROLL: I want to point out that this is not a relative of mine making this call.  (Soundbite of Laughter)  PALCA: Okay.  JOCK: It's a great book and I recommend it to anybody interested in science and particularly interested in informing themselves about the debate over evolution. The question I have is, using you science as a foundation, what do you predict will be possible in the way of translating this into clinical application in the practice of medicine in the future?  PALCA: Okay great quest. . .  JOCK: Like Genomics and, and that field is emerging as a powerful new discipline looking ahead. Thank you very much.  PALCA: Great question Jock thanks. Quick answer?  Prof. CARROLL: Yeah, great question and it gives me a great opportunity to explain the, the intimate connection here between development and, and human medicine. And so understanding those genes that determine which cells are going to be of which types and how organs grow and the identity of organs. These are the genes that we're going want to, for example, want to manipulate in with stem cell technology. So I thing that one of the things we're going to look forward to is a greater expansion of our power to regenerate tissues and uh, this will all play into the role of transplantation to repair organ damage, to replace damaged sun types and things like that.  PALCA: Sean Carroll, I need to interrupt and say we're talking with Sean Carroll about the new science of Evo-Devo. I'm Joe Palca. And this is Talk of the Nation from NPR News. Okay let's take another call. Thanks for that answer. Let's go to Jeff in Jacksonville, Florida. Jeff welcome to the program.  JEFF (Caller): Well thank you Mr. Palca. Doctor, um, real quick question. I was a diver in the Navy, and one of the, one of the tenets was that everything in the body is driven by partial pressures of various chemistries within out blood. I just wanted to know if there's, if there's anything, and I've often thought that it would be similar to what, what triggered the development of genes and the expression of genes in the partial pressures within each cell of the chemistry that's found in the amniotic fluid in a developing embryo?  PALCA: Interesting.  JEFF: Is that, is that, am I completely off base or is that, is that. . .  Prof. CARROLL: Well development is going to run generally on different chemistry. It's really the chemistry of proteins interacting with DNA and the cells interacting with each other. So all of the things you mess, mention are physiologically important, but they don't drive the process of development per se.  JEFF: Okay.  PALCA: All Right. Thanks, thanks very much for that. Let's take one more quick call and go to uh, uh, Rhonda in Des Moines, Iowa. Rhonda go ahead. You're on the program.  RHONDA (Caller): Hello.  PALCA: Hi.  RHONDA: I have always been intrigued that cloned animals aren't the same color or don't look like the animal they're cloned from. And I'm wondering if this has anything to do with that.  PALCA: Huh, interesting. Rhonda thanks for that question. Sean Carroll?  Prof. CARROLL: Great question. Cloned, you're speaking of cloned animals, Rhonda?  PALCA: Yes.  Prof. CARROLL: So the, the major technique for cloning of animals is to take the nucleus out of cell out of a typical body cell. Now that nucleus has gotten to that body cell, or gotten to that place through a long journey originally descended from an egg. There are changes that are taking place through that process that may not be reversible.  And so while cloned animals can be generated for some species from individual body cells, there have been some irreversible changes taking place such that some of those body features don't come out the same way the next time around, from, from the cloned cell. That's why we see differences, for example in body size. We see some metabolic differences and some of the features determined by the sex of the animal are also variable. So it's a great question, a great observation and if I could extend that, this is why the scientific community is uniformly against the cloning of humans. . .  PALCA: Okay well. . .  Prof. CARROLL: . . . way, shape or form because of this tremendous risk that we don't understand about between the identity of clones.  PALCA: Sean Carroll, Sean Carroll we have to take a short break. I'm Joe Palca and this is Talk of the Nation from NPR.  (sound bite of music)  PALCA: This from NPR News. This is Talk of the Nation Science Friday. I'm Joe Palca. We're talking with Sean Carroll. He's the author of Endless Forms Most Beautiful, the New Science of Evo-Devo. He's also an investigator with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and a professor of molecular biology genetics and medical genetics at the University of Wisconsin at Madison. And he's one of, well as his book title suggests, he's very involved in this new science of Evo-Devo. And we have a lot of interesting callers. So let's take one more. Let's go to Leah in Mansfield, Minnesota. Did I get that right Leah?  LEAH (Caller): Mansfield, Massachusetts.  PALCA: Oh well, wrong state. Anyway welcome to the program. What's your question?  LEAH: My question is, there is so many holes in the theory of evolution. And part of all this theory was discarded, why don't we ask a question. Who created the whole mechanism to develop the one species not another?  PALCA: Ahh.  LEAH: My second question is, who made the possibility to evolve in our genes?  PALCA: Okay.  LEAH: And my third question, it's the last one.  PALCA: Okay.  LEAH: If there are so many holes and uncertainty about evolution, why scientist don't weigh the scientific question, and don't consider that uh, the possibility of the creation by intelligent, of intelligent creation?  PALCA: Yeah.  LEAH: And the possibility the world was not created on a random, but by design.  PALCA: Well, I, those are all interesting questions and I think Sean Carroll, I'm, I'm guessing you've thought about this quite a bit.  Prof. CARROLL: My credentials in theology are fairly thin, but let me go to the point about holes in the theory of, of evolution. I think it's really important to understand that as often as that phrase is repeated, um, there's not a lot of truth to it. The point being that for 150 years biologist, geologists, scientist of all sorts of stripes have been testing and expanding upon Darwin's picture of evolution and seeing it in more rich detail as the decade's past. What we see at the level of the DNA record. What we see in embryos. What we see with new fossil discoveries, is entirely consistent an independent lines of evidence of the fundamental truth that life evolved by natural processes. In terms of the beginning of life, scientists don't really understand the beginning of life. We have some ideas but there are many, many ideas and they're all pretty much wide open to testing. In terms of design at a higher level, I think I'll pass on that one, 'cause I think every citizen's entitled to, to concede their own idea of that. And science is generally silent on that point.  PALCA: But I mean in your theory uh, doesn't it, isn't tempting to say okay uh, you know God made it work. Wasn't he so smart. He didn't reinvent the wheel for every different organism?  Prof. CARROLL: Well, I, I see you can certainly, you know, you're entitled to that viewpoint. And if you look at the scientific evidence, you'll understand that the process of genetic variation and natural selection is sufficient to account for all the changes and forms that we see through three billion years of life's history on earth. And that the scientific community has no trouble understanding the connection between simple and complex. And that that process of going from simple to complex is repeated every time an egg is fertilized. And we don't think that you need any miraculous intervention to create a human from a single fertilized egg. We know that it's biochemistry and it's cells and it's a lot of processes that are entirely observable and experimentally accessible. And so we don't reach for the supernatural, when we think the natural is completely adequate.  PALCA: Okay let's take one more call and go to Charles in Boulder, Colorado. Charles welcome to Science Friday.  CHARLES (Caller): Hi.  PALCA: Hi.  CHARLES: I have a quick question.  PALCA: Okay.  CHARLES: I want to know the impact of this research of the classification of new organisms and species and if that applies or not? And I'll take my answer off the air.  PALCA: Okay. Thanks.  Prof. CARROLL: So um, Evo-Devo is allowing us to see some connections that we couldn't see before. And what it allows us to do, for example, is that tracing the origin of particular structures. And sometimes identifying some connection that were concealed by outward appearances being so different. So it is starting to have an impact on how we understand the relationships between members of the animal kingdom. And it's allowing us to see very deeply into the stuff that makes animals similar or different. So it's going to have a contribution and it's still a matter of time, 'til we understand maybe what some of the most dramatic uh, notions we overturn through this field are going to be.  PALCA: All right. Well we've run out of time for this segment. I've like to thank my guest Sean Carroll. He's an investigator with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and a Professor of Molecular Biology at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. He's the author of Endless Forms Most Beautiful: The New Science of Evo-Devo. ", "section": "Science", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2006 NPR.  All rights reserved.

I'm Joe Palca, sitting in for Ira Flatow. For many people, there's one absolute in the wake of the devastation brought last year by Hurricane Katrina. New Orleans must be rebuilt. But if that's gonna happen, there'll have to be some new mechanisms to protect the city from future hurricanes. A report out this week on the future of coastal Louisiana offers a different take on hurricane protection. It's not enough to build bigger and better levees while ignoring the coastal landscape. In the report's view, restoring wetlands and barrier islands is as important as any engineering solution, but doing this means rethinking the management of water resources in the Gulf region. What will it take to make the change? This hour we'll talk about why engineering alone won't provide a big fix for the Big Easy. If you'd like to join our discussion, gives us a call. Our number is 1-800-989-8255. That's 1-800-989-TALK, and if you want more information about what we'll be talking about this hour, go to our website. That's www. sciencefriday. com where you'll find links to our topic. Now let me introduce my guests. Mead Allison is an associate professor in the Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences at Tulane University in New Orleans, Louisiana. He joins me today from his office there. Welcome to the program, Dr. Allison. Dr. Mead Allison (Earth and Environmental Sciences, Tulane University): Thank you, Mr. Palca. It's good to be here. PALCA: And Gerry Galloway is the Glenn L. Martin Institute professor of engineering at the University of Maryland in College Park. He was the moderator of the 2004 American Society of Civil Engineers Symposium on Coastal Louisiana, and he's a member of the Mississippi River Commission, and he's a retired brigadier general in the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers. Dr. Galloway joins me today from Middletown, Virginia. Welcome to the program, Dr. Galloway. Dr. GERRY GALLOWAY (Engineering, University of Maryland): Good afternoon, a pleasure to be with you. PALCA: And my third guest this hour is Donald Boesch. He's a professor of marine science at the University of Maryland and president of the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Sciences in Cambridge, Maryland, and he's in California today, so he joins me from Santa Barbara. Welcome back to the program, Dr. Boesch. Dr. DONALD BOESCH (Marine Science, University of Maryland): It's very good to be back on the program, Joe. PALCA: Great. Well, glad to have you again, and I'd like to start with you since you were one of the authors of this report that's just come out. Uh, huh. What are we talking about when we're talking about the importance of wetlands? Why, I mean, I don't think people really make that connection about how a wetlands is gonna help ameliorate the affect of a hurricane. Dr. BOESCH: Well, it's just a simple matter of whether a city that's fortified by levees is gonna be directly exposed to the Gulf of Mexico and, therefore, all of the power of storms that hurricanes that hit the Gulf, or whether it's going to have an expansive landscape, which in Louisiana, in the delta, is mostly wetlands that's going to buffer the storm surge, slow it down, reduce its, reduce its height such that the levees don't have to be so massive and are less likely to be defeated or overtopped. PALCA: And, I mean, what are the issues in terms of maintaining wetlands? Is that just a scientific issue where a scientist goes out and says, OK, that's wetlands. We have to restore it. Or is there more to it than that? Dr. BOESCH: No, well, the problem, of course, in the coastal Louisiana is that during the 20th century we've lost a tremendous area of wetlands. That reversed a 5,000-year trend of growth of the Mississippi delta and the coastal area. And because of a variety of human activities that levied the river, cutting off the sediments supply that nourishes the wetlands, canals for navigation, oil and gas extraction, we've caused the system to be in dysfunction so that there's a very rapid loss of wetlands. And so it's not only a question of maintaining, of trying to rebuild areas, but it's a question that if we don't do something soon, the wetlands that remain as this protective buffer will be increasingly lost. PALCA: OK, well, we'll be talking more about that in the hour, I'm sure, but I'd like now to turn to Mead Allison who's at Tulane University in New Orleans, and Tulane only recently opened for business again. How are things? I guess that's the first question. (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. ALLISON: Well, things in New Orleans are very different from things at Tulane, I guess. (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. ALLISON: The situation at Tulane is very positive right now. We're about ten days into a normal spring semester. The university's done a wonderful job of repairing any damage. Basically, we sit, we have a long, narrow campus that sits astride the boundary of areas that were dry and areas were flooded, so part of the campus experienced very little damage and part of the campus had a significant amount of water damage. But as I say, they've done a great job of getting it back together, and we have virtually all of our students have returned, and so things are very optimistic. And in the areas that are very dry, things are returning to a sense of normalcy, but that represents about 20 percent of the city's area, and if you leave that sort of shelter of sanity, things still look pretty devastated and haven't improved significantly since the hurricane. PALCA: Maybe you could remind us why New Orleans was particularly vulnerable to a hurricane strike, because there's other cities that have been hit by hurricanes but without causing, you know, 300,000 displaced people. Dr. ALLISON: Well, you know, there are, of course, many coastal cities are vulnerable to hurricanes so, of course, our proximity to the Gulf is one of the factors. But New Orleans has this special factor in that a significant portion of the city is below sea level, as much in some areas as about 12 feet below sea level. PALCA: Wow. So, OK, so I guess it's been the job of the levees to protect, to keep the water inside the channels that it's supposed to go in, and of course, those failed, and that's part of the reason the city flooded. So maybe I can turn to Gerry Galloway and ask can you bring us up to date on why these levees failed? Dr. GALLOWAY: Well, I think the answer to that is yet to be known. We recognize that there were two failures of the levees in the canal section. Everybody has seen these canals coming in off Lake Pontchartrain to the heart of New Orleans, and when the floodwalls on those canals failed, that caused a major part of the flooding. And then there was a third failure in an area along the Industrial Canal that flooded the Lower Ninth Ward that we've seen so many pictures of. But there were a number of places, 40, 50 places throughout the New Orleans metropolitan area, where the levees were overtopped by the very size of the storm surge that we've been talking about, The fact, that this wall of water came across the wetlands and up the channels and in through Lake Pontchartrain, and, in fact, came to a height that overtopped the levees. The levees then eroded and began to be compromised, and so we ended up with a lot of places in the city where the levee was badly damaged. Since the flood, the Corps of Engineers has been hard at work to try and put them back into a better shape, to restore them to the elevation that they were supposed to be in when the hurricane hit and to do this by June of next year. PALCA: So I'm wondering, now I'm testing my memory here, so I may be misquoting you slightly, but you can correct me. It seems to me I read a quote somewhere where you were quoted as saying that there are only two kinds of levees in the world, those that have been overtopped and those that are gonna be overtopped. But I took that to mean that, you know, the levee is not a perfect system. So, I mean, how far can you really go to protect a city with levees? Dr. GALLOWAY: You can do your best to protect a city from levees. I think, I mean, with levees. Levees work very well when they're properly constructed and when the threat is continuously analyzed so that you know the changes that are taking place. And Don Boesch has already pointed out that we've been losing wetlands over the years. When Danville first came to New Orleans, there was a large expanse of wetlands south of New Orleans and those gave tremendous buffering to the people in New Orleans and protected them. When the hurricanes hit, the levies they had were adequate, in most cases, to take care of the problem. And so, levies work when you carefully watch what they do; and it's interesting to note that a professor at LSU just reported that the Mississippi River levies, which have been in place for a couple hundred years, but really in strength and form since the great flood of 1927, have done reasonably well. They're strong. Certainly, when a massive flood were to come, it's possible that they could overtop, and I think that's the lesson to be learned from all of this, if you live behind a levy, there is a residual risk in that particular area in the city, against which you must be prepared. PALCA: All right, well I'd like to invite our listeners to join this conversation. Remember, the number is 800 989 8255, and why don't we go to, let's see, Peter, in Kansas City. Peter, welcome to the program. PETER (Caller): Oh, thank you. PALCA: What's your question? PETER: I appreciate being on the program. My question is: I read a long time ago that New Orleans is, actually, the Mississippi River is being diverted from its natural course, that it actually wants to go further south and southwest of New Orleans. So it seems to me, if the country as a whole is going to be rebuilding New Orleans, perhaps we should build it where it really should be and then keep old Orleans as a cultural center and as a commercial center. PALCA: Interesting, Peter. I don't know, Donald Bausch is that a question you could address? Dr. BOESCH: Yes, I think I could and I'd like to suggest that Mead Allison, who's a river expert, can amend what I say. PALCA: Okay. Dr. BOESCH: There are some folks who have recently written about this suggestion and the basic fact is that the Atchafalaya River now receives about 30 percent of the flow of the Mississippi and that's regulated by structures that are maintained by the core of engineers. And, over the 20th century, it was seen that the likelihood is that the Atchafalaya will capture more and more of the flow of the Mississippi and then, ultimately, capture most of the flow of the Mississippi, through natural processes. And so, we've intervened to keep that from happening, to a certain extent. There's been a lot of debate about whether we should just let it go or not. Of course, there's major problems with letting it take that shorter route. One, is that we have a tremendous population base and infrastructure which depends on that river, and it's not only New Orleans, it's well up to Baton Rouge, and then above, large amount of industrial capacity and the like that would be not on the river which it depends, but on the Bayou of brackish water. PALCA: um-hum. Second problem is that there are some real, although the idea sounds great in concept, it would be very impractical to build a major city in a newly aggregating, creating delta because we'd probably end up causing the same problems that we've caused over the long run in coastal Louisiana. Maybe Mead can tell us a little bit. PALCA: Well, Mead, I'm going to. . . Donald Boesch, thank you for that. And, Mead Allison, I'm going to ask you to hold your thoughts on that because we have to take a short break, but we will be coming back, so stay with us. We're talking about the rebuilding of New Orleans. (Soundbite of music) PALCA: From NPR News, this is TALK OF THE NATION, SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Joe Palca. We're talking today about rebuilding New Orleans. My guests are Donald Bausch, Professor of Marine Science at the University of Maryland, and President of the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science in Cambridge Maryland; Jerry Galloway, the Glen L. Martin Institute Professor of Engineering at the University of Maryland in College Park, and he's a retired brigadier general in the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers; and Mead Allison, an associate professor in the Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences at Tulane University in New Orleans. And we were just dealing with a question about whether or not New Orleans is in the place it ought to be because the Mississippi River wants to go in a slightly different direction. And Mead Allison, I wonder if you can talk about this idea, of letting the river take its course, essentially. Dr. ALLISON: Well, I think Don has framed the argument pretty well. I would only add that it is more than New Orleans. As Don said, it is the infrastructure that exists in the entire New Orleans to Baton Rouge quarter and the navigation issues of maintaining all that infrastructure and all that port activity in that region. Another possibility that's worth bringing in at this time, that's been discussed in many of these recent reports is, rather than going through the difficulty and expense of re-engineering to allow the system to flow in the Atchafalaya, to actually open outlets in the levy system below the city of New Orleans which allows you to maintain activity above river in that very critical zone that is New Orleans to Baton Rouge quarter. PALCA: Okay. Peter, thank you for that very interesting question. Dr. GALLOWAY: Could I jump in and just make a comment? That, I think it's interesting that most people in this country don't recognize that the nation's largest port is southern Louisiana and the impact of any operation that would cause that port to go out of business would have severe economic consequences in the country as well as southern part of the United States. And that's why, as we look at the issue of flood control, it's not jut flood control, it's not just environmental restoration; it's navigation, water supply, putting those all together and looking at them as a whole. PALCA: I see, but this raises the interesting question. I mean, you can argue the scientific merits of one plan or another, but if the politicians say, uh-uh, or if the residents say, uh-uh, what do you do in that situation, Jerry Galloway? Dr. GALLOWAY: Well, I think that's the job of the three of us on this phone call with you, to provide the science, to provide the information that convinces decision makers that they must look at this issue holistically, that the idea of just putting up levies, and restoring the levies, or just dealing with coastal restoration, or just dealing with navigation, is wrong-headed. The way to solve the problem is to work AT them together and to come up with solutions that will allow us to deal with this. Long before Katrina, there were efforts to have coastal Louisiana restoration activity. Long before Katrina, we built, in 1990, the canal and divers structure, what needs talking about; opening the levies so that water can go through during certain periods of the year, to replenish the wetlands with nutrients and sediment. PALCA: Okay. Let's bring our callers into this and I'll remind everybody that our number is 800-989-8255, that's 800-989-TALK. And let's go to Jordan in another city on the Mississippi, St. Louis. JORDAN (Caller): Yeah, hi, everybody. PALCA: Hi. JORDAN: So, we've already done hurricanes. We've done it; it was impressive, but St. Louis knows very well about the New Madrid fault. The next threat to New Orleans is the one that they experienced 200 years ago which put the s-bend in the river down there, the great earthquake that shook up New Orleans once before will do it again. And so, I think the solution was voiced very well by Bill Maher, who said we should move New Orleans to Kansas would get the (unintelligible) removed and New Orleans would be safe again. PALCA: I refuse to take your premise, but interesting nonetheless. Well, hold on; let's see if we can get some thoughts on that. I'm a little at loss. Is this your area, Mead Allison? Dr. ALLISON: Well, I'll, let me go a little bit, tangentially and say that, it is certainly important to recognize that in right now Katrina is the 900 pound gorilla out there; but at the same time, much of the engineering that was created in south Louisiana and on up the Mississippi River channel to St. Louis has been designed to handle major floods and I assumed, although I'm not an earthquake expert, that there would be some effect on Mississippi River flow, by that type of event. So, I think it's important that we recognize that whatever design that we arrive at, that enhances our protection from hurricanes, we still have to recognize that the entire corridor is vulnerable to a major flood and that we need to keep that in mind as we design in the future. PALCA: But I wonder if we could turn to Jerry Galloway. Do the core or do the people think about earthquakes, for example? Dr. GALLOWAY: Certainly. You may recall, it was probably ten years ago, somebody predicted that the great earthquake would occur in December of that year along the New Madrid fault and people worried that if the water were high during that period and you had some sort of seismic activity, you could have problems with the levies. Fortunately, levies tend to be the size of the levies we have on the Mississippi tend to be somewhat resilient and in the case of earthquake, but again, it would depend on the size. The interesting challenge is, the city of Sacramento, faces that very threat every year with the seismic activity in California and being surrounded by levies. PALCA: Huh. JORDAN: It's not just a New Orleans issue, how you deal with these multiple hazards. PALCA: Okay, Jordan, thanks very much for that call. Let's go to Todd in Phoenix, Arizona. Todd, welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. TODD (Caller): Thank you. My question is, I'm wondering why nobody has suggested turning it into something similar to Venice and Italy and if they did, if the buildings have the same susceptibility to sinking? PALCA: Donald Bausch are you familiar enough with Venice to compare Venice with New Orleans? Dr. BOESCH: I am familiar with both New Orleans and Venice. There have been people to suggest that, I think not very well informed people, but that's been suggested. Let me see if I can take a crack at it, but first, let me just with the previous caller, I'm not aware of any catastrophic earthquake that affected New Orleans, you know, diseases, fires, river floods, of course, were part of its history. And most every place we live has some threats and it's important also to keep in mind that the reason New Orleans flooded the way it did and held its water is not because the levies were over top but because they actually structurally failed. This is a human problem, an engineering problem that we should be trying to fix and storm surges from hurricanes can over top levies but only for a very short period of time. Levies, when they're breached, of course, cause massive problems and that's what we need to deal with. Let me just talk about the Venice situation. The, there is the serious consideration in some of the low lying areas of New Orleans of what to do, whether they should be redeveloped or whether they should be some sort of open space, wetlands, lakes, that sort of thing, and I think this is yet to be played out. There's a lot of social concerns and so on about this. I think it's likely that one of the outcomes will be that there will be urban land institute for example recommended that there be open green space which might be a buffer from hurricane flooding that might occur on occasion, but also from heavy rainfall and the like some of these low lying areas wouldn't be rebuilt they would be put into that purpose. The likelihood the people will inhabit that by living on stilts or traveling around to their homes and businesses by boats and gondolas I think is pretty unlikely and I think it's probably consistent with what the American lifestyle is interested in; however, there's very likely to be, I think, requirements to be put in place by flood restrictions that houses, as they be rebuilt have to be elevated so if there is a modest flood, we'll say for levies, it's always a possibility they will not do the permanent damage to homes and structures that we saw in the storm. PALCA: Todd, thank you. Dr. GALLOWAY: I think moving up rather than flooding areas and having people living in those flooded areas is the likely. . . Dr. Allison: Venice is going through some real problems in trying to maintain what it has already and it's gong to take some major infrastructure to keep it alive. PALCA: Right, that's right. Dr. Allison: Interesting. TODD: That's part of my question; would they be susceptible to sinking if it were built as Venice? PALCA: Interesting. Donald Bausch, what do you think about that? Dr. BOESCH: Yeah, I think, Mead talked earlier about here being parts of the city limits that are as much as 12 feet below sea level. The principal reason that that's so is that houses weren't built below sea level when land was developed when they were built. The principal reason is that the land has sunk. And it sunk primarily; we know there's regional sinking of the Delta area. It sunk primarily because it was built on swamp. And those highly organic wet soils lost their volume because of the decomposition of organic matter, the lowering of the water table, so that if we could have some of these low-lying areas converted to areas that are, you know, that we would be allowed a flood periodically and put into and not occupied, this could allow us to adjust the water table upward in the city. And we could reduce the rate of future sinking of land within the city. PALCA: See, but here's what I'm thinking. You talk in a lot of these reports about bringing the stakeholders in to have these discussions. But I'm betting you didn't have any gondoliers on your committee to give you that perspective, so. Dr. BOESCH: Well, I would say that I have read that City Park in New Orleans has an official gondolier with a gondola that was built by a man in North Carolina who actually went to Venice to learn his trade. So, in fact, we do have a local expertise here. PALCA: Well, maybe I'm wrong. Maybe it is the stakeholder population there represented. But I wonder if I could turn to you, Gerry Galloway, for something that Donald Boesch just said in terms of, you know, the levies broke but that's a human problem and we have to figure out how to fix that. It seems to me that in almost every disaster where something happens and something breaks they say we realize the problem but now we know how to make it better. And then, you know, sometimes it doesn't happen again for 10 or 20 years but then it breaks again and then we say, oh, we realize the problem now that we thought we realized 20 years ago but now we really realize it and we're going to make it better. I mean, can you really design the perfect levy? Dr. GALLOWAY: I think what you do is do your very best after every engineering problem to deal with it. The challenge we face in New Orleans is illustrative of so many other places in the country. And it's dealing with an infrastructure that needs to be maintained, that needs to be monitored. We still don't know why the levies failed, the flood walls failed, on the canals. We've got some good ideas. There are forensic teams trying to identify that. When they find that out, and hopefully they'll have that information shortly, that will be built into the reconstruction of the existing levies. And, as you know, the next step, the people in New Orleans are clamoring for, the president has said stronger and better levies, they'll go to, perhaps, some combination of levies and the work and the restoration to rebuild New Orleans to protect against a larger hurricane. That should take into account the failures that were identified in Katrina. My experience with engineering has been, yes, we can solve that particular problem. The next problem will probably be a different problem. And it's one that says you need constant monitoring, you need to know and understand what you're dealing with, and you need to make sure that you're maintaining and upgrading as necessary. And that wasn't always done in the New Orleans area. PALCA: OK. We're talking with Mead Allison, Donald Boesch, and Gerry Galloway, three scientists and engineers definitely interested in the question of rebuilding New Orleans. I need to remind people that this is TALK OF THE NATION. I'm Joe Palca, and this is TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. Let's go to the phones again. And we have a call from a man, I assume it's a man, named Peboy(ph) in Jacksonville, Florida. Peboy, welcome to the program. PEBOY, caller: Hello, (unintelligible). How are you all doing today? PALCA: Good. PEBOY: Well, I haven't been displaced out of New Orleans. And I got out early and took the family and went to the daughter's house in Jacksonville. And we've been here ever since. And the biggest problem, and every one of you gentlemen has picked it out, is the fact that they didn't watch over the levies, they didn't look them, they didn't take care of them like they're supposed to. We suspect that they didn't build them right in the first place. But New Orleans being such an immoral town, that's the problem that we have to deal with. But I have a sneaking suspicion that if they went to rebuild those wetlands and let that water go down out of Southwest Pass and go across there and rebuild that so when the hurricane comes up you ain't got that, that'll be fine. But I also know the fact that they aren't going to rebuild my house. I mean, it's completely gone and the area it's in. You know, I want to go back but that area don't need to be built in no more. And there are some people that are just going to have to give it up. And I know it's real hard. But there are areas they shouldn't rebuild in. And they're going to be poor areas, some like the 9th Ward. But they're going to be areas and lakefront along Paris Avenue and Atlantic Canal and all of that. So, I don't see a lot of people coming back, but I see a chance, finally, to do something right. PALCA: Well, what do you think about that, Gerry Galloway? Do you accept Peboy's criticism that they weren't built properly and that there's no way to protect certain areas? Dr. GALLOWAY: I think there are ways to protect certain areas. But I think Don has already brought up the issue of there are some areas that would be better off if they were placed into wetlands if that appears to be the solution the people on the ground want. The other thing that they've had a problem with, the walls that were built along the canal were built as flood walls and not as levies because people didn't want to take the real estate necessary to build a levy there. What we have now is the opportunity, with the houses destroyed, if you're going to provide that protection to provide strong protection to do it the right way, provide adequate right of way for what's being done. Were they built the right way the first time? I think certainly the people that did it thought they were built the right way. Did they make adjustments to compensate for the fact that there was a narrow right of way? Certainly. And I think that's the sort of thing you want to avoid when you go back in there this time. PEBOY: Well, I don't know if I agree with them being built right the first time for, you know, working down there for so many years. But you've got a my-backyard attitude, it's. . . Dr. GALLOWAY: Well, it's. . . PEBOY: . . . the biggest problem right there. PALCA: Yes. It's possible. Dr. GALLOWAY: You're absolutely right. And I think we'll know this. You know there is an investigation going on, a combination of the American Society of Civil Engineers, the Corps of Engineers, academics, people from the business world, and that it's all being overseen by the National Research Council, National Academies, looking at this. And I think you're going to get an honest appraisal within the next 60 to 120 days of exactly what went wrong. And I've been seeing in the press time and time again that they're going to tell it like it is. And I think that will mean a lot to you who have lived there. PALCA: Peboy, thanks a lot for the call. Gerry Galloway, I just wonder if I could. . . I didn't realize that there's an issue in terms of, I mean, in terms of right way. How much space do you need to build a levy? I mean, was the problem again that real estate interests were pushing up against the banks of the river? Dr. GALLOWAY: Well, it's. . . PALCA: Or the banks of the canals? Dr. GALLOWAY: . . . along the canals, people have their homes there. If you go back and you walk along the canals, you see that the homes were very close. When you decide that you're going to raise the elevation of the levy, there's certainly the height. In this case, a floodwall went up six, eight, ten feet. And instead of having a levy that for every foot that goes up you may need six feet in the lateral dimension. And because you are right at the edge of the canal when you built those, you couldn't expand into the canal. You would have had to set back the levy, move it back, which would have caused the displacement of a number of homes. That's the not-in-my-backyard syndrome that he just referred to. PALCA: Right. Well, Gerry Galloway, we're going to have to take a short break. We're talking about the rebuilding of New Orleans. Stay with us. This is TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. From NPR News, this is TALK OF THE NATION Science Friday. I'm Joe Palca. We're talking this hour about rebuilding New Orleans. My guests are Gerry Galloway, the Glenn L. Martin Institute Professor of Engineering at the University of Maryland in College Park, Mead Allison, Associate Professor in the Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences at Tulane University in New Orleans, and Donald Boesch, Professor of Marine Science at the University of Maryland and President of the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science in Cambridge, Maryland. And I wonder, Mead Allison, if I can just ask you, as someone who's in New Orleans now and has thought about this a lot, I mean, from a scientific standpoint, never mind political, socioeconomic, what have you, from a scientific standpoint, as best as you can tell, are there areas of New Orleans that people just shouldn't think about rebuilding? Dr. ALLISON: Well, I don't think it is possible to disentangle the scientific side from the economic and the social aspects. But certainly it's more difficult to protect people in lower elevations than it is to protect people that are closer to sea level or, in some cases, above sea level in the city of New Orleans. I did want to, sort of, expand on something that Don said earlier about this idea that there has been significant subsidence in part of the city or in the city of New Orleans. But actually metropolitan New Orleans has experienced a great deal of subsidence due to water withdrawal that's a function of the pumping of the city to maintain, basically, dry land that, even in the absence of a storm, if you turn off the pumps, the city fills up with water, albeit a bit more slowly. And so it's evidence of this ongoing subsidence that, in fact, functions to lower the elevation of levies. I mean, some of these levies have been in place for decades. And clearly we're beginning to find out that their elevations were not what we thought they were. And, of course, it also makes much more difficult the engineering problem of building a stable substrate for these levies. PALCA: Yes. Donald Boesch, maybe I could get you to explain, you know, why the city is subsiding or sinking. Dr. BOESCH: Well, there are a number of reasons. First of all, just in terms of the deeper geology, the Mississippi River has been depositing sediments out in that region for a very long time. And so the mass of the weight of that, of those sediments, has kind of down-warped the underlying rocks in the geology. That's a slow and steady process. And it's a fairly small amount of sinking of the land. The others, of course, are things that we do, humans in the more recent period of time have done, including the drainage of wetland soils which, through the process that Mead described, caused fairly rapid sinking. Now, in New Orleans, most of that happened in the early part of the 20th century, the expansion out from this historic footprint that Mead described as the dry land into the wetland areas as the city and the population grew, the demand for a suburban lifestyle and the like. And so those areas sank that 8 to 10 to 12 feet fairly rapidly over just tens of years. And the rate of continued sinking in the future is probably likely to be a lot slower than it has than in that past period. But it's still sinking. And so we do need to think about how we can manage drainage and the water table to slow that process down. Other causes are when we load onto this soil, this river sediment, a road or a levy. It causes sinking. And the other thing that's a problem, and it's not a problem in New Orleans, per se, but in the wetlands, is now there's emerging evidence that oil and gas withdrawals, the deposits of oil and gas and the other salt water is all included in those deposits. The pumping out of that that took place during the middle part of the 20th century, middle to the late part of the 20th century, caused a sinking of the land, which isn't a problem with respect to human flooding, but it's a major problem that causes a wetland loss. PALCA: I'd like to invite another caller on to the discussion. Let's go to Ken in Greenville, North Carolina. Ken, welcome to Science Friday. KEN (Caller): Hi. I was just wondering if you had an estimate of how much it would cost to restore the coastal wetlands or to build a levy that would withstand a category five hurricane? PALCA: Gerry Galloway, is that something you've crossed out? Dr. GALLOWAY: Well, I think you have to look at those two together. This very fine report that Don Boesch has just led, and I'd urge any of the listeners to go to http://www. umces. edu, talks about that in some length. The estimate started off that coastal Louisiana restoration was going to be $14 to $20 billion. Changing from a Category Three to a Category Five Hurricane Protection would be $2. 5 billion. But that was before Katrina. So we're not talking about small change, we're talking about billions of dollars and something that can't be done overnight but needs to be started tomorrow. PALCA: Donald Bosh, I wonder if I can come back to you about that. People talk about restoring the wetlands, is that really possible? Or once they're gone, they're gone? Dr. BOESCH: Well, yeah, we don't use the word restore in the sense that you're going to recreate them exactly where they were. What we're talking about is restoring the processes by which the wetlands sustained themselves over time, allowing the river to flow back out into the surrounding areas rather than out to the deep Gulf of Mexico, as Mead described: managing the legacy of our canals, and so on, which have caused and continue to cause problems, such that it allows the continuance of wetlands into the future; taking, where there are opportunities of river divergence and creating new wetlands. So it's a combination of kind of increasing the longevity of the existing wetlands and, where possible, extending out to new wetlands, rather than creating a map that looks like one, you know, fifty years ago. PALCA: Okay, Ken, thanks very much for that call. KEN: Yep. Do you have that website again? PALCA: You know what? I think it'd be, if you go to http://www. sciencefriday. com. . . KEN: It's on there? PALCA: . . . it'll probably be on there. If it's not on there now, it will be soon, so check there. It's probably easier. KEN: All right. Thanks very much. PALCA: All right. Let's go to another call and try Kelly (ph). Kelly, in Des Moines, Iowa, welcome to the program. KELLY (Caller): Hi. Thank you very much. My question is concerning the levies and their maintenance. PALCA: Okay. KELLY: And, the first part of that question is, who was responsible for the maintenance of the levies before Katrina hit? And the second part of the question is, when the levies are rebuilt, and federal funds are going to rebuild those, will it be the state's responsibility to maintain those then, or will it become the federal government's responsibility? PALCA: Hm. Gerry Galloway, is that something you're responsible. . . Dr. GALLOWAY: Yeah, the, typically in New Orleans the responsibility rests with what are called Levy Boards to do the routine maintenance of the levies on the Mississippi and on Lake Pontchartrain. When a federal project is built, there is a local sponsor that signs up to take care of the local expenses, and then, once the project is completed, take care of the maintenance and upgrades as necessary. It's a little bit different on the Mississippi River in New Orleans, because there's a unique responsibility of the federal government to do major maintenance. But if the federal government comes in, as they are, restoring the levies to their previous condition, and if they were to upgrade them, the local sponsor, under the current laws, would be responsible for the continuing maintenance. Now, the state of Louisiana, and Mead can probably talk to this better, but the state of Louisiana is closely examining the organization they have for this operation. Locally constituted levy boards, consolidated levy boards, trying to bring more order or control over what goes on by these levy boards and the carrying out of their responsibilities. PALCA: Mead, do you have something to add to that? Mead Allison? Dr. ALLISON: Yeah, only that I would agree that, with Gerry, that, in fact, in the city, in the metropolitan area, there are seven different levy boards. And there is certainly a major effort in the state, and bills before the state legislature, to consider a consolidation of those levy boards to streamline this process. PALCA: And Mead Allison, I wonder if I can just follow up on Kelly's question, which is what does it mean, exactly, to maintain a levy? I mean, what do you have to do, or does it depend on the kind of levy you're talking about? Dr. ALLISON: Well, it's maintaining both the character, Gerry may be able to speak more to this than I would, but I would assume that in the case of an earthen levy you have to make sure the continued strength and soil testing to observe that, and then the integrity of flood walls as well. And as I've said before, I think in a continually subsiding environment, the elevation of those levies and maintaining a close watch on that elevation is also critical. Dr. GALLOWAY: Yes, that's exactly right Mead. It's a matter of watching what's going on, identifying small changes that might lead to larger changes, taking care of the day to day maintenance, taking trees out, making sure there's not encroachment in the levy, and that people aren't building into the levy that they are ready to take on the next challenge. And in New Orleans, that additional challenge is they're in continual subsidence, so somebody has to make sure they're at the right elevation. And that's a nationwide challenge right now. We've got a lot of levies; we don't even know where all the levies are in the nation, much less their condition. And there are several bills pending in the Congress to ask the federal government to go out and find these and to find out what their condition is and to report back on that. PALCA: Okay, Kelly, thanks very much for that call. You know, I've just been thinking that we've talked about levies as a protection from water, and we've talked about pumps as a way of protecting a city that's, as you say, under sea level, and we've talked about wetlands. Are those the three major things, or have we left something out? Maybe Gerry Galloway, in terms of protection? Dr. GALLOWAY: Well, there's another aspect, and I'd like Don to comment on this too, is that many people look at the pictures of the Thames River or the Netherlands and see these massive gates that seem to provide some sort of total protection for a city. There are other methods of dealing with hurricanes, and all of these need to be taken into account. But I wouldn't expect to see the same types of protections you see on the North Sea coast and the Netherlands in New Orleans, although some people would speak to that. There may be places where you want to put surge gates to keep the storm, the hurricane surge, from getting into Lake Pontchartrain, but I don't think you'd see the same sort of thing that you see in the Netherlands. So it's really wetlands, it's levies, it's interior drainage, and other structures as needed; but they're not the first line. PALCA: Donald Boesch, maybe you can explain what kind of approaches they've tried in the Netherlands? Because they're also facing the problem of being under sea level. Dr. BOESCH: That's right, and, the situation in the Netherlands is a bit different though, and in our report we urge that we learn from how the Dutch have approached their flood protection problems. Because they have not only a large, very energetic ocean nearby, the North Sea, but they also have a big river, which is flood-prone, the Rhine System coming through the country. And, they have a very massive dyke system at the coastal margin and then surrounding all the areas and waterways, but also some barriers that can be, that allow tidal flow in and out but can be closed off when there are major storm risks. The problem in Louisiana is that if you did that along the whole coast, first of all the coast is a lot bigger than the Netherlands, and it'd be very, extremely costly, and, of course, in Holland it's a matter of national priority because most of their population lives in this low-lying area. I question whether that would be appropriate or would be acceptable in the United States. But, more importantly from a scientific prospective, if one built those kinds of more or less continuous, very large, massive levy systems, even if it did have some flood gates, it would affect the, what we did with the river water, which is needed to restore the wetlands. It would also affect the tidal flow in and out of the coastal areas, which is very important in allowing those wetlands to continue to grow upward as they sink, if you will, due to both subsidence as well as sea level rise. So we need to make sure that whatever we do in these protection systems we allow a sustainable, self-sustaining coastal landscape to exist in concert with these levies and flood gates. PALCA: We're talking about. . . Dr. ALLISON: Joe, can I add something to your original question? PALCA: Well, one moment. I just want to remind people that we're talking about rebuilding New Orleans, and that I'm Joe Palca, and this is TALK OF THE NATION, from NPR News. Mead Allison was that, that was you? Dr. ALLISON: Yes. PALCA: Sorry. Go ahead please. Dr. ALLISON: Yeah, I, your original question was, are there any other aspects that we haven't considered that come under this protection strategy, and I think it should be pointed out that the Barrier Islands that exist off coastal Louisiana are another very important natural aspect. They provide, if you will, the speed bump to the storm surge, and also help to dampen wave energy. And it hasn't been brought up that much thus far, but, when levies are attacked, they're not simply attacked by the storm surge, but it's also the waves on top of the storm surge that have an effect. So anything you can do to dampen wave energy is also a potential protection strategy. GALLOWAY: And as you go back to talking about. . . PALCO: Gerry Galloway. Sorry, go ahead. Dr. GALLOWAY: . . . your original question, the issue of what you do in the city of New Orleans is going to be important. New Orleans is one of the few places in the country where people who live inside a levy are required to have flood insurance in a good part of the city. And that's because, this has been mentioned several times, if you have a tremendous rainstorm in New Orleans, all that water is already in the ground, and it ends up filling every ditch, every nook and cranny, and they end up having to pump it out, and they can't pump it out, sometimes, as fast. And so there is an interior flood plane created by the problems with pumping in New Orleans. And so, one of the solutions in the long run is to examine exactly where people should be, and at what elevation they should rebuild; and this can't be neglected. PALCO: Well, we've only got a couple minutes left, and I just, I want to get your, each of your thoughts very quickly on how well the science of doing this job is understood. As we were saying earlier, to present a question of what to do to policy makers, and then, of course, all the different issues have to come into play to what they actually do do, and money is one of them. But very briefly, Gerry Galloway, how well do you think we understand the science here? Dr. GALLOWAY: I think we're learning a great deal. I think we're sharing this science, and what we're doing that's the most important in my view, is integrating the views of the different aspects of science and the different approaches to solving this problem. So it's not just done in each's, it's done in an integrated whole. PALCO: Okay, thanks. Donald Boesch. Dr. BOESCH: I think we know an awful lot about this system, in terms of how it was created geologically, what sustains it, and I think we know enough to take some action. I think we know what we need to do with respect to restoring river flow into the system, and I think it's time that we begin doing it. And as we do that, we can watch it and learn, very accurately, and adapt our strategies into the future. But it's time for action, not time for a long episode of more scientific studies and research. PALCO: Okay, Mead Allison, you get the last word. Dr. ALLISON: Well, I think I agree with both of them. I would only add that one of the things at the Louisiana site that has been very encouraging is that, an issue that has been studied heavily for decades within Louisiana now has attracted a great deal of scientific interest and scientific talent from outside the state; and in fact worldwide. And I think that's going to be, ultimately, tremendously beneficial to the overall scientific side of this issue. PALCA: Okay, that's where we have to leave things. I'd like to thank my guests this hour; Mead Allison is an Associate Professor in the Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences at Tulane University in New Orleans, Louisiana. Donald Boesch is a Professor of Marine Science at the University of Maryland, and President of the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science in Cambridge, Maryland. And Gerry Galloway, the Glen L. Martin Institute Professor of Engineering at the University of Maryland, in College Park. Thanks very much to all of you. GALLOWAY: Good to be with you, Joe. Thank you.  JOE PALCA, host:  This is TALK OF THE NATION: Science Friday from NPR News. I'm Joe Palca, sitting in for Ira Flatow.  For many people, there's one absolute in the wake of the devastation brought last year by Hurricane Katrina. New Orleans must be rebuilt. But if that's gonna happen, there'll have to be some new mechanisms to protect the city from future hurricanes.  A report out this week on the future of coastal Louisiana offers a different take on hurricane protection. It's not enough to build bigger and better levees while ignoring the coastal landscape. In the report's view, restoring wetlands and barrier islands is as important as any engineering solution, but doing this means rethinking the management of water resources in the Gulf region. What will it take to make the change?  This hour we'll talk about why engineering alone won't provide a big fix for the Big Easy. If you'd like to join our discussion, gives us a call. Our number is 1-800-989-8255. That's 1-800-989-TALK, and if you want more information about what we'll be talking about this hour, go to our website. That's www. sciencefriday. com where you'll find links to our topic.  Now let me introduce my guests. Mead Allison is an associate professor in the Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences at Tulane University in New Orleans, Louisiana. He joins me today from his office there. Welcome to the program, Dr. Allison.  Dr. Mead Allison (Earth and Environmental Sciences, Tulane University): Thank you, Mr. Palca. It's good to be here.  PALCA: And Gerry Galloway is the Glenn L. Martin Institute professor of engineering at the University of Maryland in College Park. He was the moderator of the 2004 American Society of Civil Engineers Symposium on Coastal Louisiana, and he's a member of the Mississippi River Commission, and he's a retired brigadier general in the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers. Dr. Galloway joins me today from Middletown, Virginia. Welcome to the program, Dr. Galloway.  Dr. GERRY GALLOWAY (Engineering, University of Maryland): Good afternoon, a pleasure to be with you.  PALCA: And my third guest this hour is Donald Boesch. He's a professor of marine science at the University of Maryland and president of the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Sciences in Cambridge, Maryland, and he's in California today, so he joins me from Santa Barbara. Welcome back to the program, Dr. Boesch.  Dr. DONALD BOESCH (Marine Science, University of Maryland): It's very good to be back on the program, Joe.  PALCA: Great. Well, glad to have you again, and I'd like to start with you since you were one of the authors of this report that's just come out. Uh, huh. What are we talking about when we're talking about the importance of wetlands? Why, I mean, I don't think people really make that connection about how a wetlands is gonna help ameliorate the affect of a hurricane.  Dr. BOESCH: Well, it's just a simple matter of whether a city that's fortified by levees is gonna be directly exposed to the Gulf of Mexico and, therefore, all of the power of storms that hurricanes that hit the Gulf, or whether it's going to have an expansive landscape, which in Louisiana, in the delta, is mostly wetlands that's going to buffer the storm surge, slow it down, reduce its, reduce its height such that the levees don't have to be so massive and are less likely to be defeated or overtopped.  PALCA: And, I mean, what are the issues in terms of maintaining wetlands? Is that just a scientific issue where a scientist goes out and says, OK, that's wetlands. We have to restore it. Or is there more to it than that?  Dr. BOESCH: No, well, the problem, of course, in the coastal Louisiana is that during the 20th century we've lost a tremendous area of wetlands. That reversed a 5,000-year trend of growth of the Mississippi delta and the coastal area. And because of a variety of human activities that levied the river, cutting off the sediments supply that nourishes the wetlands, canals for navigation, oil and gas extraction, we've caused the system to be in dysfunction so that there's a very rapid loss of wetlands. And so it's not only a question of maintaining, of trying to rebuild areas, but it's a question that if we don't do something soon, the wetlands that remain as this protective buffer will be increasingly lost.  PALCA: OK, well, we'll be talking more about that in the hour, I'm sure, but I'd like now to turn to Mead Allison who's at Tulane University in New Orleans, and Tulane only recently opened for business again. How are things? I guess that's the first question.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Dr. ALLISON: Well, things in New Orleans are very different from things at Tulane, I guess.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Dr. ALLISON: The situation at Tulane is very positive right now. We're about ten days into a normal spring semester. The university's done a wonderful job of repairing any damage. Basically, we sit, we have a long, narrow campus that sits astride the boundary of areas that were dry and areas were flooded, so part of the campus experienced very little damage and part of the campus had a significant amount of water damage.  But as I say, they've done a great job of getting it back together, and we have virtually all of our students have returned, and so things are very optimistic. And in the areas that are very dry, things are returning to a sense of normalcy, but that represents about 20 percent of the city's area, and if you leave that sort of shelter of sanity, things still look pretty devastated and haven't improved significantly since the hurricane.  PALCA: Maybe you could remind us why New Orleans was particularly vulnerable to a hurricane strike, because there's other cities that have been hit by hurricanes but without causing, you know, 300,000 displaced people.  Dr. ALLISON: Well, you know, there are, of course, many coastal cities are vulnerable to hurricanes so, of course, our proximity to the Gulf is one of the factors. But New Orleans has this special factor in that a significant portion of the city is below sea level, as much in some areas as about 12 feet below sea level.  PALCA: Wow. So, OK, so I guess it's been the job of the levees to protect, to keep the water inside the channels that it's supposed to go in, and of course, those failed, and that's part of the reason the city flooded. So maybe I can turn to Gerry Galloway and ask can you bring us up to date on why these levees failed?  Dr. GALLOWAY: Well, I think the answer to that is yet to be known. We recognize that there were two failures of the levees in the canal section. Everybody has seen these canals coming in off Lake Pontchartrain to the heart of New Orleans, and when the floodwalls on those canals failed, that caused a major part of the flooding. And then there was a third failure in an area along the Industrial Canal that flooded the Lower Ninth Ward that we've seen so many pictures of.  But there were a number of places, 40, 50 places throughout the New Orleans metropolitan area, where the levees were overtopped by the very size of the storm surge that we've been talking about, The fact, that this wall of water came across the wetlands and up the channels and in through Lake Pontchartrain, and, in fact, came to a height that overtopped the levees. The levees then eroded and began to be compromised, and so we ended up with a lot of places in the city where the levee was badly damaged.  Since the flood, the Corps of Engineers has been hard at work to try and put them back into a better shape, to restore them to the elevation that they were supposed to be in when the hurricane hit and to do this by June of next year.  PALCA: So I'm wondering, now I'm testing my memory here, so I may be misquoting you slightly, but you can correct me. It seems to me I read a quote somewhere where you were quoted as saying that there are only two kinds of levees in the world, those that have been overtopped and those that are gonna be overtopped. But I took that to mean that, you know, the levee is not a perfect system. So, I mean, how far can you really go to protect a city with levees?  Dr. GALLOWAY: You can do your best to protect a city from levees. I think, I mean, with levees. Levees work very well when they're properly constructed and when the threat is continuously analyzed so that you know the changes that are taking place. And Don Boesch has already pointed out that we've been losing wetlands over the years. When Danville first came to New Orleans, there was a large expanse of wetlands south of New Orleans and those gave tremendous buffering to the people in New Orleans and protected them. When the hurricanes hit, the levies they had were adequate, in most cases, to take care of the problem.  And so, levies work when you carefully watch what they do; and it's interesting to note that a professor at LSU just reported that the Mississippi River levies, which have been in place for a couple hundred years, but really in strength and form since the great flood of 1927, have done reasonably well. They're strong.  Certainly, when a massive flood were to come, it's possible that they could overtop, and I think that's the lesson to be learned from all of this, if you live behind a levy, there is a residual risk in that particular area in the city, against which you must be prepared.  PALCA: All right, well I'd like to invite our listeners to join this conversation. Remember, the number is 800 989 8255, and why don't we go to, let's see, Peter, in Kansas City. Peter, welcome to the program.  PETER (Caller): Oh, thank you.  PALCA: What's your question?  PETER: I appreciate being on the program. My question is: I read a long time ago that New Orleans is, actually, the Mississippi River is being diverted from its natural course, that it actually wants to go further south and southwest of New Orleans. So it seems to me, if the country as a whole is going to be rebuilding New Orleans, perhaps we should build it where it really should be and then keep old Orleans as a cultural center and as a commercial center.  PALCA: Interesting, Peter. I don't know, Donald Bausch is that a question you could address?  Dr. BOESCH: Yes, I think I could and I'd like to suggest that Mead Allison, who's a river expert, can amend what I say.  PALCA: Okay.  Dr. BOESCH: There are some folks who have recently written about this suggestion and the basic fact is that the Atchafalaya River now receives about 30 percent of the flow of the Mississippi and that's regulated by structures that are maintained by the core of engineers. And, over the 20th century, it was seen that the likelihood is that the Atchafalaya will capture more and more of the flow of the Mississippi and then, ultimately, capture most of the flow of the Mississippi, through natural processes.  And so, we've intervened to keep that from happening, to a certain extent. There's been a lot of debate about whether we should just let it go or not. Of course, there's major problems with letting it take that shorter route.  One, is that we have a tremendous population base and infrastructure which depends on that river, and it's not only New Orleans, it's well up to Baton Rouge, and then above, large amount of industrial capacity and the like that would be not on the river which it depends, but on the Bayou of brackish water.  PALCA: um-hum.  Second problem is that there are some real, although the idea sounds great in concept, it would be very impractical to build a major city in a newly aggregating, creating delta because we'd probably end up causing the same problems that we've caused over the long run in coastal Louisiana.  Maybe Mead can tell us a little bit.  PALCA: Well, Mead, I'm going to. . . Donald Boesch, thank you for that. And, Mead Allison, I'm going to ask you to hold your thoughts on that because we have to take a short break, but we will be coming back, so stay with us. We're talking about the rebuilding of New Orleans.  (Soundbite of music)  PALCA: From NPR News, this is TALK OF THE NATION, SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Joe Palca.  We're talking today about rebuilding New Orleans. My guests are Donald Bausch, Professor of Marine Science at the University of Maryland, and President of the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science in Cambridge Maryland; Jerry Galloway, the Glen L. Martin Institute Professor of Engineering at the University of Maryland in College Park, and he's a retired brigadier general in the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers; and Mead Allison, an associate professor in the Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences at Tulane University in New Orleans.  And we were just dealing with a question about whether or not New Orleans is in the place it ought to be because the Mississippi River wants to go in a slightly different direction. And Mead Allison, I wonder if you can talk about this idea, of letting the river take its course, essentially.  Dr. ALLISON: Well, I think Don has framed the argument pretty well. I would only add that it is more than New Orleans. As Don said, it is the infrastructure that exists in the entire New Orleans to Baton Rouge quarter and the navigation issues of maintaining all that infrastructure and all that port activity in that region.  Another possibility that's worth bringing in at this time, that's been discussed in many of these recent reports is, rather than going through the difficulty and expense of re-engineering to allow the system to flow in the Atchafalaya, to actually open outlets in the levy system below the city of New Orleans which allows you to maintain activity above river in that very critical zone that is New Orleans to Baton Rouge quarter.  PALCA: Okay. Peter, thank you for that very interesting question.  Dr. GALLOWAY: Could I jump in and just make a comment? That, I think it's interesting that most people in this country don't recognize that the nation's largest port is southern Louisiana and the impact of any operation that would cause that port to go out of business would have severe economic consequences in the country as well as southern part of the United States. And that's why, as we look at the issue of flood control, it's not jut flood control, it's not just environmental restoration; it's navigation, water supply, putting those all together and looking at them as a whole.  PALCA: I see, but this raises the interesting question. I mean, you can argue the scientific merits of one plan or another, but if the politicians say, uh-uh, or if the residents say, uh-uh, what do you do in that situation, Jerry Galloway?  Dr. GALLOWAY: Well, I think that's the job of the three of us on this phone call with you, to provide the science, to provide the information that convinces decision makers that they must look at this issue holistically, that the idea of just putting up levies, and restoring the levies, or just dealing with coastal restoration, or just dealing with navigation, is wrong-headed. The way to solve the problem is to work AT them together and to come up with solutions that will allow us to deal with this.  Long before Katrina, there were efforts to have coastal Louisiana restoration activity. Long before Katrina, we built, in 1990, the canal and divers structure, what needs talking about; opening the levies so that water can go through during certain periods of the year, to replenish the wetlands with nutrients and sediment.  PALCA: Okay. Let's bring our callers into this and I'll remind everybody that our number is 800-989-8255, that's 800-989-TALK.  And let's go to Jordan in another city on the Mississippi, St. Louis.  JORDAN (Caller): Yeah, hi, everybody.  PALCA: Hi.  JORDAN: So, we've already done hurricanes. We've done it; it was impressive, but St. Louis knows very well about the New Madrid fault. The next threat to New Orleans is the one that they experienced 200 years ago which put the s-bend in the river down there, the great earthquake that shook up New Orleans once before will do it again. And so, I think the solution was voiced very well by Bill Maher, who said we should move New Orleans to Kansas would get the (unintelligible) removed and New Orleans would be safe again.  PALCA: I refuse to take your premise, but interesting nonetheless.  Well, hold on; let's see if we can get some thoughts on that. I'm a little at loss. Is this your area, Mead Allison?  Dr. ALLISON: Well, I'll, let me go a little bit, tangentially and say that, it is certainly important to recognize that in right now Katrina is the 900 pound gorilla out there; but at the same time, much of the engineering that was created in south Louisiana and on up the Mississippi River channel to St. Louis has been designed to handle major floods and I assumed, although I'm not an earthquake expert, that there would be some effect on Mississippi River flow, by that type of event.  So, I think it's important that we recognize that whatever design that we arrive at, that enhances our protection from hurricanes, we still have to recognize that the entire corridor is vulnerable to a major flood and that we need to keep that in mind as we design in the future.  PALCA: But I wonder if we could turn to Jerry Galloway. Do the core or do the people think about earthquakes, for example?  Dr. GALLOWAY: Certainly. You may recall, it was probably ten years ago, somebody predicted that the great earthquake would occur in December of that year along the New Madrid fault and people worried that if the water were high during that period and you had some sort of seismic activity, you could have problems with the levies.  Fortunately, levies tend to be the size of the levies we have on the Mississippi tend to be somewhat resilient and in the case of earthquake, but again, it would depend on the size.  The interesting challenge is, the city of Sacramento, faces that very threat every year with the seismic activity in California and being surrounded by levies.  PALCA: Huh.  JORDAN: It's not just a New Orleans issue, how you deal with these multiple hazards.  PALCA: Okay, Jordan, thanks very much for that call. Let's go to Todd in Phoenix, Arizona. Todd, welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY.  TODD (Caller): Thank you. My question is, I'm wondering why nobody has suggested turning it into something similar to Venice and Italy and if they did, if the buildings have the same susceptibility to sinking?  PALCA: Donald Bausch are you familiar enough with Venice to compare Venice with New Orleans?  Dr. BOESCH: I am familiar with both New Orleans and Venice. There have been people to suggest that, I think not very well informed people, but that's been suggested. Let me see if I can take a crack at it, but first, let me just with the previous caller, I'm not aware of any catastrophic earthquake that affected New Orleans, you know, diseases, fires, river floods, of course, were part of its history.  And most every place we live has some threats and it's important also to keep in mind that the reason New Orleans flooded the way it did and held its water is not because the levies were over top but because they actually structurally failed. This is a human problem, an engineering problem that we should be trying to fix and storm surges from hurricanes can over top levies but only for a very short period of time.  Levies, when they're breached, of course, cause massive problems and that's what we need to deal with. Let me just talk about the Venice situation. The, there is the serious consideration in some of the low lying areas of New Orleans of what to do, whether they should be redeveloped or whether they should be some sort of open space, wetlands, lakes, that sort of thing, and I think this is yet to be played out.  There's a lot of social concerns and so on about this. I think it's likely that one of the outcomes will be that there will be urban land institute for example recommended that there be open green space which might be a buffer from hurricane flooding that might occur on occasion, but also from heavy rainfall and the like some of these low lying areas wouldn't be rebuilt they would be put into that purpose.  The likelihood the people will inhabit that by living on stilts or traveling around to their homes and businesses by boats and gondolas I think is pretty unlikely and I think it's probably consistent with what the American lifestyle is interested in; however, there's very likely to be, I think, requirements to be put in place by flood restrictions that houses, as they be rebuilt have to be elevated so if there is a modest flood, we'll say for levies, it's always a possibility they will not do the permanent damage to homes and structures that we saw in the storm.  PALCA: Todd, thank you.  Dr. GALLOWAY: I think moving up rather than flooding areas and having people living in those flooded areas is the likely. . .  Dr. Allison: Venice is going through some real problems in trying to maintain what it has already and it's gong to take some major infrastructure to keep it alive.  PALCA: Right, that's right.  Dr. Allison: Interesting.  TODD: That's part of my question; would they be susceptible to sinking if it were built as Venice?  PALCA: Interesting. Donald Bausch, what do you think about that?  Dr. BOESCH: Yeah, I think, Mead talked earlier about here being parts of the city limits that are as much as 12 feet below sea level. The principal reason that that's so is that houses weren't built below sea level when land was developed when they were built. The principal reason is that the land has sunk. And it sunk primarily; we know there's regional sinking of the Delta area. It sunk primarily because it was built on swamp. And those highly organic wet soils lost their volume because of the decomposition of organic matter, the lowering of the water table, so that if we could have some of these low-lying areas converted to areas that are, you know, that we would be allowed a flood periodically and put into and not occupied, this could allow us to adjust the water table upward in the city. And we could reduce the rate of future sinking of land within the city.  PALCA: See, but here's what I'm thinking. You talk in a lot of these reports about bringing the stakeholders in to have these discussions. But I'm betting you didn't have any gondoliers on your committee to give you that perspective, so.  Dr. BOESCH: Well, I would say that I have read that City Park in New Orleans has an official gondolier with a gondola that was built by a man in North Carolina who actually went to Venice to learn his trade. So, in fact, we do have a local expertise here.  PALCA: Well, maybe I'm wrong. Maybe it is the stakeholder population there represented. But I wonder if I could turn to you, Gerry Galloway, for something that Donald Boesch just said in terms of, you know, the levies broke but that's a human problem and we have to figure out how to fix that.  It seems to me that in almost every disaster where something happens and something breaks they say we realize the problem but now we know how to make it better. And then, you know, sometimes it doesn't happen again for 10 or 20 years but then it breaks again and then we say, oh, we realize the problem now that we thought we realized 20 years ago but now we really realize it and we're going to make it better.  I mean, can you really design the perfect levy?  Dr. GALLOWAY: I think what you do is do your very best after every engineering problem to deal with it. The challenge we face in New Orleans is illustrative of so many other places in the country. And it's dealing with an infrastructure that needs to be maintained, that needs to be monitored.  We still don't know why the levies failed, the flood walls failed, on the canals. We've got some good ideas. There are forensic teams trying to identify that. When they find that out, and hopefully they'll have that information shortly, that will be built into the reconstruction of the existing levies.  And, as you know, the next step, the people in New Orleans are clamoring for, the president has said stronger and better levies, they'll go to, perhaps, some combination of levies and the work and the restoration to rebuild New Orleans to protect against a larger hurricane.  That should take into account the failures that were identified in Katrina. My experience with engineering has been, yes, we can solve that particular problem. The next problem will probably be a different problem. And it's one that says you need constant monitoring, you need to know and understand what you're dealing with, and you need to make sure that you're maintaining and upgrading as necessary. And that wasn't always done in the New Orleans area.  PALCA: OK. We're talking with Mead Allison, Donald Boesch, and Gerry Galloway, three scientists and engineers definitely interested in the question of rebuilding New Orleans. I need to remind people that this is TALK OF THE NATION. I'm Joe Palca, and this is TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.  Let's go to the phones again. And we have a call from a man, I assume it's a man, named Peboy(ph) in Jacksonville, Florida. Peboy, welcome to the program.  PEBOY, caller: Hello, (unintelligible). How are you all doing today?  PALCA: Good.  PEBOY: Well, I haven't been displaced out of New Orleans. And I got out early and took the family and went to the daughter's house in Jacksonville. And we've been here ever since.  And the biggest problem, and every one of you gentlemen has picked it out, is the fact that they didn't watch over the levies, they didn't look them, they didn't take care of them like they're supposed to. We suspect that they didn't build them right in the first place.  But New Orleans being such an immoral town, that's the problem that we have to deal with. But I have a sneaking suspicion that if they went to rebuild those wetlands and let that water go down out of Southwest Pass and go across there and rebuild that so when the hurricane comes up you ain't got that, that'll be fine.  But I also know the fact that they aren't going to rebuild my house. I mean, it's completely gone and the area it's in. You know, I want to go back but that area don't need to be built in no more. And there are some people that are just going to have to give it up.  And I know it's real hard. But there are areas they shouldn't rebuild in. And they're going to be poor areas, some like the 9th Ward. But they're going to be areas and lakefront along Paris Avenue and Atlantic Canal and all of that. So, I don't see a lot of people coming back, but I see a chance, finally, to do something right.  PALCA: Well, what do you think about that, Gerry Galloway? Do you accept Peboy's criticism that they weren't built properly and that there's no way to protect certain areas?  Dr. GALLOWAY: I think there are ways to protect certain areas. But I think Don has already brought up the issue of there are some areas that would be better off if they were placed into wetlands if that appears to be the solution the people on the ground want.  The other thing that they've had a problem with, the walls that were built along the canal were built as flood walls and not as levies because people didn't want to take the real estate necessary to build a levy there. What we have now is the opportunity, with the houses destroyed, if you're going to provide that protection to provide strong protection to do it the right way, provide adequate right of way for what's being done.  Were they built the right way the first time? I think certainly the people that did it thought they were built the right way. Did they make adjustments to compensate for the fact that there was a narrow right of way? Certainly. And I think that's the sort of thing you want to avoid when you go back in there this time.  PEBOY: Well, I don't know if I agree with them being built right the first time for, you know, working down there for so many years. But you've got a my-backyard attitude, it's. . .  Dr. GALLOWAY: Well, it's. . .  PEBOY: . . . the biggest problem right there.  PALCA: Yes. It's possible.  Dr. GALLOWAY: You're absolutely right. And I think we'll know this. You know there is an investigation going on, a combination of the American Society of Civil Engineers, the Corps of Engineers, academics, people from the business world, and that it's all being overseen by the National Research Council, National Academies, looking at this.  And I think you're going to get an honest appraisal within the next 60 to 120 days of exactly what went wrong. And I've been seeing in the press time and time again that they're going to tell it like it is. And I think that will mean a lot to you who have lived there.  PALCA: Peboy, thanks a lot for the call. Gerry Galloway, I just wonder if I could. . . I didn't realize that there's an issue in terms of, I mean, in terms of right way. How much space do you need to build a levy? I mean, was the problem again that real estate interests were pushing up against the banks of the river?  Dr. GALLOWAY: Well, it's. . .  PALCA: Or the banks of the canals?  Dr. GALLOWAY: . . . along the canals, people have their homes there. If you go back and you walk along the canals, you see that the homes were very close. When you decide that you're going to raise the elevation of the levy, there's certainly the height. In this case, a floodwall went up six, eight, ten feet. And instead of having a levy that for every foot that goes up you may need six feet in the lateral dimension.  And because you are right at the edge of the canal when you built those, you couldn't expand into the canal. You would have had to set back the levy, move it back, which would have caused the displacement of a number of homes. That's the not-in-my-backyard syndrome that he just referred to.  PALCA: Right. Well, Gerry Galloway, we're going to have to take a short break. We're talking about the rebuilding of New Orleans. Stay with us.  This is TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.  From NPR News, this is TALK OF THE NATION Science Friday. I'm Joe Palca. We're talking this hour about rebuilding New Orleans. My guests are Gerry Galloway, the Glenn L. Martin Institute Professor of Engineering at the University of Maryland in College Park, Mead Allison, Associate Professor in the Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences at Tulane University in New Orleans, and Donald Boesch, Professor of Marine Science at the University of Maryland and President of the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science in Cambridge, Maryland.  And I wonder, Mead Allison, if I can just ask you, as someone who's in New Orleans now and has thought about this a lot, I mean, from a scientific standpoint, never mind political, socioeconomic, what have you, from a scientific standpoint, as best as you can tell, are there areas of New Orleans that people just shouldn't think about rebuilding?  Dr. ALLISON: Well, I don't think it is possible to disentangle the scientific side from the economic and the social aspects. But certainly it's more difficult to protect people in lower elevations than it is to protect people that are closer to sea level or, in some cases, above sea level in the city of New Orleans.  I did want to, sort of, expand on something that Don said earlier about this idea that there has been significant subsidence in part of the city or in the city of New Orleans. But actually metropolitan New Orleans has experienced a great deal of subsidence due to water withdrawal that's a function of the pumping of the city to maintain, basically, dry land that, even in the absence of a storm, if you turn off the pumps, the city fills up with water, albeit a bit more slowly.  And so it's evidence of this ongoing subsidence that, in fact, functions to lower the elevation of levies. I mean, some of these levies have been in place for decades. And clearly we're beginning to find out that their elevations were not what we thought they were. And, of course, it also makes much more difficult the engineering problem of building a stable substrate for these levies.  PALCA: Yes. Donald Boesch, maybe I could get you to explain, you know, why the city is subsiding or sinking.  Dr. BOESCH: Well, there are a number of reasons. First of all, just in terms of the deeper geology, the Mississippi River has been depositing sediments out in that region for a very long time. And so the mass of the weight of that, of those sediments, has kind of down-warped the underlying rocks in the geology. That's a slow and steady process. And it's a fairly small amount of sinking of the land.  The others, of course, are things that we do, humans in the more recent period of time have done, including the drainage of wetland soils which, through the process that Mead described, caused fairly rapid sinking. Now, in New Orleans, most of that happened in the early part of the 20th century, the expansion out from this historic footprint that Mead described as the dry land into the wetland areas as the city and the population grew, the demand for a suburban lifestyle and the like.  And so those areas sank that 8 to 10 to 12 feet fairly rapidly over just tens of years. And the rate of continued sinking in the future is probably likely to be a lot slower than it has than in that past period. But it's still sinking. And so we do need to think about how we can manage drainage and the water table to slow that process down.  Other causes are when we load onto this soil, this river sediment, a road or a levy. It causes sinking. And the other thing that's a problem, and it's not a problem in New Orleans, per se, but in the wetlands, is now there's emerging evidence that oil and gas withdrawals, the deposits of oil and gas and the other salt water is all included in those deposits.  The pumping out of that that took place during the middle part of the 20th century, middle to the late part of the 20th century, caused a sinking of the land, which isn't a problem with respect to human flooding, but it's a major problem that causes a wetland loss.  PALCA: I'd like to invite another caller on to the discussion. Let's go to Ken in Greenville, North Carolina. Ken, welcome to Science Friday.  KEN (Caller): Hi. I was just wondering if you had an estimate of how much it would cost to restore the coastal wetlands or to build a levy that would withstand a category five hurricane?  PALCA: Gerry Galloway, is that something you've crossed out?  Dr. GALLOWAY: Well, I think you have to look at those two together. This very fine report that Don Boesch has just led, and I'd urge any of the listeners to go to http://www. umces. edu, talks about that in some length. The estimate started off that coastal Louisiana restoration was going to be $14 to $20 billion. Changing from a Category Three to a Category Five Hurricane Protection would be $2. 5 billion. But that was before Katrina. So we're not talking about small change, we're talking about billions of dollars and something that can't be done overnight but needs to be started tomorrow.  PALCA: Donald Bosh, I wonder if I can come back to you about that. People talk about restoring the wetlands, is that really possible? Or once they're gone, they're gone?  Dr. BOESCH: Well, yeah, we don't use the word restore in the sense that you're going to recreate them exactly where they were. What we're talking about is restoring the processes by which the wetlands sustained themselves over time, allowing the river to flow back out into the surrounding areas rather than out to the deep Gulf of Mexico, as Mead described: managing the legacy of our canals, and so on, which have caused and continue to cause problems, such that it allows the continuance of wetlands into the future; taking, where there are opportunities of river divergence and creating new wetlands. So it's a combination of kind of increasing the longevity of the existing wetlands and, where possible, extending out to new wetlands, rather than creating a map that looks like one, you know, fifty years ago.  PALCA: Okay, Ken, thanks very much for that call.  KEN: Yep. Do you have that website again?  PALCA: You know what? I think it'd be, if you go to http://www. sciencefriday. com. . .  KEN: It's on there?  PALCA: . . . it'll probably be on there. If it's not on there now, it will be soon, so check there. It's probably easier.  KEN: All right. Thanks very much.  PALCA: All right. Let's go to another call and try Kelly (ph). Kelly, in Des Moines, Iowa, welcome to the program.  KELLY (Caller): Hi. Thank you very much. My question is concerning the levies and their maintenance.  PALCA: Okay.  KELLY: And, the first part of that question is, who was responsible for the maintenance of the levies before Katrina hit? And the second part of the question is, when the levies are rebuilt, and federal funds are going to rebuild those, will it be the state's responsibility to maintain those then, or will it become the federal government's responsibility?  PALCA: Hm. Gerry Galloway, is that something you're responsible. . .  Dr. GALLOWAY: Yeah, the, typically in New Orleans the responsibility rests with what are called Levy Boards to do the routine maintenance of the levies on the Mississippi and on Lake Pontchartrain. When a federal project is built, there is a local sponsor that signs up to take care of the local expenses, and then, once the project is completed, take care of the maintenance and upgrades as necessary. It's a little bit different on the Mississippi River in New Orleans, because there's a unique responsibility of the federal government to do major maintenance. But if the federal government comes in, as they are, restoring the levies to their previous condition, and if they were to upgrade them, the local sponsor, under the current laws, would be responsible for the continuing maintenance.  Now, the state of Louisiana, and Mead can probably talk to this better, but the state of Louisiana is closely examining the organization they have for this operation. Locally constituted levy boards, consolidated levy boards, trying to bring more order or control over what goes on by these levy boards and the carrying out of their responsibilities.  PALCA: Mead, do you have something to add to that? Mead Allison?  Dr. ALLISON: Yeah, only that I would agree that, with Gerry, that, in fact, in the city, in the metropolitan area, there are seven different levy boards. And there is certainly a major effort in the state, and bills before the state legislature, to consider a consolidation of those levy boards to streamline this process.  PALCA: And Mead Allison, I wonder if I can just follow up on Kelly's question, which is what does it mean, exactly, to maintain a levy? I mean, what do you have to do, or does it depend on the kind of levy you're talking about?  Dr. ALLISON: Well, it's maintaining both the character, Gerry may be able to speak more to this than I would, but I would assume that in the case of an earthen levy you have to make sure the continued strength and soil testing to observe that, and then the integrity of flood walls as well. And as I've said before, I think in a continually subsiding environment, the elevation of those levies and maintaining a close watch on that elevation is also critical.  Dr. GALLOWAY: Yes, that's exactly right Mead. It's a matter of watching what's going on, identifying small changes that might lead to larger changes, taking care of the day to day maintenance, taking trees out, making sure there's not encroachment in the levy, and that people aren't building into the levy that they are ready to take on the next challenge. And in New Orleans, that additional challenge is they're in continual subsidence, so somebody has to make sure they're at the right elevation.  And that's a nationwide challenge right now. We've got a lot of levies; we don't even know where all the levies are in the nation, much less their condition. And there are several bills pending in the Congress to ask the federal government to go out and find these and to find out what their condition is and to report back on that.  PALCA: Okay, Kelly, thanks very much for that call. You know, I've just been thinking that we've talked about levies as a protection from water, and we've talked about pumps as a way of protecting a city that's, as you say, under sea level, and we've talked about wetlands. Are those the three major things, or have we left something out? Maybe Gerry Galloway, in terms of protection?  Dr. GALLOWAY: Well, there's another aspect, and I'd like Don to comment on this too, is that many people look at the pictures of the Thames River or the Netherlands and see these massive gates that seem to provide some sort of total protection for a city. There are other methods of dealing with hurricanes, and all of these need to be taken into account. But I wouldn't expect to see the same types of protections you see on the North Sea coast and the Netherlands in New Orleans, although some people would speak to that.  There may be places where you want to put surge gates to keep the storm, the hurricane surge, from getting into Lake Pontchartrain, but I don't think you'd see the same sort of thing that you see in the Netherlands. So it's really wetlands, it's levies, it's interior drainage, and other structures as needed; but they're not the first line.  PALCA: Donald Boesch, maybe you can explain what kind of approaches they've tried in the Netherlands? Because they're also facing the problem of being under sea level.  Dr. BOESCH: That's right, and, the situation in the Netherlands is a bit different though, and in our report we urge that we learn from how the Dutch have approached their flood protection problems. Because they have not only a large, very energetic ocean nearby, the North Sea, but they also have a big river, which is flood-prone, the Rhine System coming through the country.  And, they have a very massive dyke system at the coastal margin and then surrounding all the areas and waterways, but also some barriers that can be, that allow tidal flow in and out but can be closed off when there are major storm risks.  The problem in Louisiana is that if you did that along the whole coast, first of all the coast is a lot bigger than the Netherlands, and it'd be very, extremely costly, and, of course, in Holland it's a matter of national priority because most of their population lives in this low-lying area. I question whether that would be appropriate or would be acceptable in the United States. But, more importantly from a scientific prospective, if one built those kinds of more or less continuous, very large, massive levy systems, even if it did have some flood gates, it would affect the, what we did with the river water, which is needed to restore the wetlands.  It would also affect the tidal flow in and out of the coastal areas, which is very important in allowing those wetlands to continue to grow upward as they sink, if you will, due to both subsidence as well as sea level rise. So we need to make sure that whatever we do in these protection systems we allow a sustainable, self-sustaining coastal landscape to exist in concert with these levies and flood gates.  PALCA: We're talking about. . .  Dr. ALLISON: Joe, can I add something to your original question?  PALCA: Well, one moment. I just want to remind people that we're talking about rebuilding New Orleans, and that I'm Joe Palca, and this is TALK OF THE NATION, from NPR News.  Mead Allison was that, that was you?  Dr. ALLISON: Yes.  PALCA: Sorry. Go ahead please.  Dr. ALLISON: Yeah, I, your original question was, are there any other aspects that we haven't considered that come under this protection strategy, and I think it should be pointed out that the Barrier Islands that exist off coastal Louisiana are another very important natural aspect. They provide, if you will, the speed bump to the storm surge, and also help to dampen wave energy. And it hasn't been brought up that much thus far, but, when levies are attacked, they're not simply attacked by the storm surge, but it's also the waves on top of the storm surge that have an effect. So anything you can do to dampen wave energy is also a potential protection strategy.  GALLOWAY: And as you go back to talking about. . .  PALCO: Gerry Galloway. Sorry, go ahead.  Dr. GALLOWAY: . . . your original question, the issue of what you do in the city of New Orleans is going to be important. New Orleans is one of the few places in the country where people who live inside a levy are required to have flood insurance in a good part of the city. And that's because, this has been mentioned several times, if you have a tremendous rainstorm in New Orleans, all that water is already in the ground, and it ends up filling every ditch, every nook and cranny, and they end up having to pump it out, and they can't pump it out, sometimes, as fast. And so there is an interior flood plane created by the problems with pumping in New Orleans.  And so, one of the solutions in the long run is to examine exactly where people should be, and at what elevation they should rebuild; and this can't be neglected.  PALCO: Well, we've only got a couple minutes left, and I just, I want to get your, each of your thoughts very quickly on how well the science of doing this job is understood. As we were saying earlier, to present a question of what to do to policy makers, and then, of course, all the different issues have to come into play to what they actually do do, and money is one of them. But very briefly, Gerry Galloway, how well do you think we understand the science here?  Dr. GALLOWAY: I think we're learning a great deal. I think we're sharing this science, and what we're doing that's the most important in my view, is integrating the views of the different aspects of science and the different approaches to solving this problem. So it's not just done in each's, it's done in an integrated whole.  PALCO: Okay, thanks. Donald Boesch.  Dr. BOESCH: I think we know an awful lot about this system, in terms of how it was created geologically, what sustains it, and I think we know enough to take some action. I think we know what we need to do with respect to restoring river flow into the system, and I think it's time that we begin doing it. And as we do that, we can watch it and learn, very accurately, and adapt our strategies into the future. But it's time for action, not time for a long episode of more scientific studies and research.  PALCO: Okay, Mead Allison, you get the last word.  Dr. ALLISON: Well, I think I agree with both of them. I would only add that one of the things at the Louisiana site that has been very encouraging is that, an issue that has been studied heavily for decades within Louisiana now has attracted a great deal of scientific interest and scientific talent from outside the state; and in fact worldwide. And I think that's going to be, ultimately, tremendously beneficial to the overall scientific side of this issue.  PALCA: Okay, that's where we have to leave things. I'd like to thank my guests this hour; Mead Allison is an Associate Professor in the Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences at Tulane University in New Orleans, Louisiana. Donald Boesch is a Professor of Marine Science at the University of Maryland, and President of the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science in Cambridge, Maryland. And Gerry Galloway, the Glen L. Martin Institute Professor of Engineering at the University of Maryland, in College Park.  Thanks very much to all of you.  GALLOWAY: Good to be with you, Joe.

And here's something that caught our ears, something we're pretty sure has never snuck into a State of the Union before. President GEORGE W. BUSH: We'll also fund additional research in cutting-edge methods of producing ethanol, not just from corn, but from wood chips and stalks or switch grass. BLOCK: Switch grass. We figured we should learn more about it, so we called switch grass expert David Bransby. He's originally from South Africa. He's a professor of energy crops at Auburn University in Alabama, where he grows switch grass. Dr. DAVID BRANSBY (Auburn University): Switch grass is a tall, what we call a bunch grass. It grows erect; it grows up to eight to nine feet tall. It is native to the United States, which, of course, is very attractive to our environmentalists. They like to see us using native plants rather than introduced plants or what they call exotic plants. BLOCK: As a native grass, where would it grow? Dr. BRANSBY: It grows throughout the United States. It has, for any plant species, it has a remarkable range of climatic tolerance, so there are varieties that grow along the Gulf Coast and there are other varieties that'll grow right up into Canada. BLOCK: And why is switch grass considered good for -- as a potential fuel source? Dr. BRANSBY: Well, basically, to produce energy from any crop, the key thing is to produce the crop cheaply and in order to get a low cost per ton, the first thing you need is a high yield per acre and then low production costs and that's what switch grass does the best for us right now. You can get yields of between five and 10 tons per acre with very low fertilizer costs and so that's why it is so attractive compared to other options. BLOCK: Well, say you're getting 10 tons of switch grass per acre and you convert that to ethanol. How many gallons of fuel would you end up with? Dr. BRANSBY: The best technologies that I know of right now are predicting at least 100 gallons of ethanol per ton, so that would convert to 1,000 gallons of ethanol per acre. BLOCK: Is that a lot? Dr. BRANSBY: That is high. Yeah, let's just say what does ethanol sell for? Let's say $1. 50. That works back to $1,500 per acre. There are no crops in this country that can do that right now. BLOCK: And one of the benefits, as I understand it, is that in producing fuel this way, you are essentially recycling carbon dioxide. Dr. BRANSBY: That's exactly right. Plants absorb the carbon from the atmosphere as carbon dioxide and then once you actually produce the fuel and burn that fuel, it just sends that carbon dioxide back up into the atmosphere. BLOCK: In one of the complaints about ethanol is that it can take more energy to produce it, if you're growing a crop, than you actually get out of it. Is that a problem also with switch grass? Dr. BRANSBY: It used to be a problem with corn to ethanol. It is not even a problem there anymore. But with switch grass, it's very different. Inputs are very much lower and we use the whole plant, not just grain. Therefore, the estimates that we have for energy in versus energy out is about, for one unit of energy in, we get about four units of energy out in the form of ethanol. BLOCK: Do you have any idea how switch grass made it into the State of the Union? What lobby or interest group was putting it in there? Dr. BRANSBY: Well, our Senator Sessions from Alabama. BLOCK: Was it Senator Jeff Sessions from Alabama? Dr. BRANSBY: Correct, yes. Now I had a call from his office on Monday. Then had a few e-mails go backwards and forwards, and I just got one right before you called to say it was a last minute inclusion in the speech and it was Senator Sessions that helped get it into there.

I'm Linda Wertheimer. Researchers at Seoul National University last year said they had made eleven different embryonic stem cell lines from cloned human embryos. South Korean officials believed that breakthrough would bring cures to the sick, and economic prosperity to the country. Investigation has shown that most, if not all of that work was fabricated. Korean scientists were not the only ones trying to make stem cells from cloned human embryos. As NPR's Joe Palca reports, two research teams in the United Kingdom may be the ones to achieve that goal. JOE PALCA reporting: Edinburgh is a city proud of its scientific and medical achievements. CAB DRIVER: The building on you're right, here, that's the Royal College of Surgeons. PALCA: We're in a cab, on our way to see the scientists who conducted probably the most famous experiment of the past decade. CAB DRIVER: Ian Wilmut? No, I don't think I do. Ian Wilmut. PALCA: Dolly, the sheep. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Oh yeah, there in Roseland. PALCA: Yes. In 1996, Ian Wilmut was at the Roseland Institute at the edge of town. That's where he shook the foundations of biology by making an exact genetic copy, a clone, of an adult mammal; Dolly. Wilmut says he doesn't mind being less famous than the sheep. Dr. IAN WILMUT (Scientist, Scotland): I'm very happy with that. I mean, I think, you know, a celebrity brings its drawbacks. PALCA: Wilmut is still working on cloning, but this time he doesn't want to make an animal, he wants to make a cloned human embryo; and then use that embryo to get embryonic stem cells. Wilmut believes stem cells made this way could revolutionize medicine, just as Dolly revolutionized biology. The British government believes that as well and has embraced this kind of research. Most scientists thought South Korean researchers had overcome the technical difficulties to making stem cells from cloned embryos. Dr. WILMUT: You tended to think that the basic methodology was established. It's not. PALCO: Have you formed any theory about what happened in Korea? Dr. WILMUT. No. I find it impossible to understand. So it's as simple as that. PALCA: Wilmut has permission from the United Kingdom government to attempt to clone a human embryo, but he'd put his work on hold when he thought the Koreans had succeeded. Now, he says, his group in Edinburgh will try and achieve the allusive prize. Dr. WILMUT: And I'm sure there are other groups--group in Newcastle. It'll happen. UNIDENTIFIED FLIGHT ATTENDANT: Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen. We're about to arrive into Newcastle. Changes and connections. . . PALCO: Newcastle is in England's industrial northeast. It's a region that fell on economic hard times, and it's looking to cutting edge technologies for prosperity. Part of that technology includes making stem cells. Mr. MARTIN COX (The Institute of Human Genetics, University of New Castle): (Heard ordering lunch) PALCA: Over lunch, Martin Cox says New Castle's recovery is well under way. Cox is in charge of stem cell programs at the University of New Castle. He says the city has already built what it calls the United Kingdom's first biotechnology village, a giant glass and steel complex in the center of town. Mr. COX: We've just secured ten million pounds from the regional development agency, who do see stem cells as a potential growth area. And hopefully next month we'll be starting to build two new laboratories upstairs. PALCA: One of those labs will be for Alison Murdock. She's the only other person in the United Kingdom, besides Wilmut, with the necessary government approvals to try to clone a human embryo. She's a fertility doctor by training, but like Wilmut, she turned to cloned stem cells because of their potential to cure diseases. Murdock knows some people aren't comfortable with the research. Dr. ALISON MURDOCK (a gynecologist and Professor of Reproductive Medicine at Newcastle University): It's new. It's a little bit frightening for people. It comes with a lot of words that frighten people like embryo and cloning. PALCA: But Murdock says once she explains it and tells people why she wants to do it, most people support it. Basically, Murdock says the whole point of her cloning research is to make an adult cell behave in a way it's not used to behaving. Dr. MURDOCK: Every single cell in our body has all the genetic materials that can make every single cell type. So, if it's a skin cell, it's still got the genes inside the skin cell that can, say, become heart muscle. PALCA: It's just that the genes for making heart muscle are switched off. Dr. MURDOCK: What we would like to do is basically wipe the board clean, like, you know, pressing the reformat button on the computer, and say to skin cells, Forget you're a skin cell. Go back to square one and become a heart muscle cell. PALCA: Murdock says if you could do that, then if somebody's heart went bad, you could take one of his skin cells, hit the reformat button, and make new heart muscle cells tailored just for him. Dr. MURDOCK: At the present time, the only way that we know how to press the reformat button is to put that skin cell nucleus into an egg; because that's exactly what the egg does when you activate it. It just wipes it clean. It becomes an embryonic stem cell line, and the embryonic stem cell line can become any cell found in the body. PALCA: That's the theory anyway. So far, nobody has made an embryonic stem cell line that way, although South Korean scientists said they had. And if somebody does succeed, the cells may not work as scientists hope for treating diseases. But Murdock thinks the promise is too tantalizing not to try. The job of transferring a skin cell nucleus into an egg falls to Murdock's colleague, Lyle Armstrong. Dr. LYLE ARMSTRONG (Lecturer, Surgical and Reproductive Services, University of Newcastle Upon Tyne): This, for example, on the right, is the laboratory where we perform nuclear transfer. You can have a quick look. PALCA: Inside is a relatively spartan room. It's very clean. Armstrong takes a dust cover off a piece of equipment sitting on a lab bench. Dr. ARMSTRONG: This is the actual manipulation system that we have. As you can see, it's basically a microscope. PALCA: There's a joystick on either side of that microscope. The joysticks control tiny glass tubes thinner than a human hair. These are used to transfer DNA from an adult cell into the tiny, gelatinous egg. Armstrong says it takes endless hours and a devotion bordering on madness to become expert at using the system. Dr. ARMSTRONG: As you can see, the chair is not particularly comfortable. It requires keeping the back straight, the legs straight and the hands rigid, so you will be quite stiff at the end of the day doing about 100 eggs. It's a very useful piece of equipment but it's the one that you learn to hate. PALCA: Armstrong and his colleagues managed to get one cloned embryo to grow to the point where they could remove embryonic stem cells, but the embryonic stem cells wouldn't multiply in the lab. They're getting ready to try again. Cloned embryonic stem cells have yet to bring cures to diseases but they're already having an impact on Britain. Dr. ARMSTRONG: I was actually born on the very northern edge of Newcastle in what used to be the largest mining village in the world, a place called Ashington. PALCA: Armstrong says in those days, coal ruled Newcastle. Dr. ARMSTRONG: It was very heavily polluted, very heavy industry. You could wake up in the morning and walk to school and you could taste the sulphur dioxide in the air from all the coal burning. PALCA: Now the air is clear and the city is thriving and at least part of the reason for that is its investment in stem cell technology. Armstrong says it's possible that cloned embryonic stem cells will be a dead end. Dr. ARMSTRONG: It may be that we will find that the difficulties involved in the process are just too great; they may be insurmountable. But, of course, until we actually investigate the procedure further, we won't know that. PALCA: But if the procedure does work, the benefits could be enormous. Cloning pioneer Ian Wilmut believes that this type of stem cell research could lead to a greater understanding of, and eventually even cures for some dreadful diseases. Dr. IAN WILMUT, Ph. D (Cloning Pioneer; Professor and Head of the Department of Gene Expression and Development, Roslin Institute, Edinburgh, Scotland): ALS, Parkinson's comes into the same category, Alzheimer's, schizophrenia, various cancers; just about every family will be affected by one of those. One of my daughters has breast cancer. So, these are immensely important diseases and the reason to (unintelligible) treatment for any of them; in some cases there's none. PALCA: The U. K. government is promoting embryonic stem cell research, in sharp contrast to the restrictions the U. S. government has placed on American researchers. Even so, Wilmut says more is needed. He says what stem cell research needs is something like the Human Genome Project, an international multi-billion dollar commitment to achieving a scientific goal. Dr. WILMUT: That's the sort of scale of activity that we have to think about if you really want to bring through research with stem cells to have all of its benefits in different ways. PALCA: That's not likely to happen without financial backing from the United States. So far, there's no indication that the Bush Administration shares Wilmut's vision; quite the contrary. In his State of the Union message President Bush said attempting to make cloned embryos was an egregious abuse of medical research and asked Congress to prohibit it. Joe Palca, NPR News.

You could wake up in the morning and walk to school and you could taste the sulphur dioxide in the air from all the coal burning.  PALCA: Now the air is clear and the city is thriving and at least part of the reason for that is its investment in stem cell technology. Armstrong says it's possible that cloned embryonic stem cells will be a dead end.  Dr. ARMSTRONG: It may be that we will find that the difficulties involved in the process are just too great; they may be insurmountable. But, of course, until we actually investigate the procedure further, we won't know that.  PALCA: But if the procedure does work, the benefits could be enormous. Cloning pioneer Ian Wilmut believes that this type of stem cell research could lead to a greater understanding of, and eventually even cures for some dreadful diseases.  Dr. IAN WILMUT, Ph. D (Cloning Pioneer; Professor and Head of the Department of Gene Expression and Development, Roslin Institute, Edinburgh, Scotland): ALS, Parkinson's comes into the same category, Alzheimer's, schizophrenia, various cancers; just about every family will be affected by one of those. One of my daughters has breast cancer. So, these are immensely important diseases and the reason to (unintelligible) treatment for any of them; in some cases there's none.  PALCA: The U. K. government is promoting embryonic stem cell research, in sharp contrast to the restrictions the U. S. government has placed on American researchers. Even so, Wilmut says more is needed. He says what stem cell research needs is something like the Human Genome Project, an international multi-billion dollar commitment to achieving a scientific goal.  Dr. WILMUT: That's the sort of scale of activity that we have to think about if you really want to bring through research with stem cells to have all of its benefits in different ways.  PALCA: That's not likely to happen without financial backing from the United States. So far, there's no indication that the Bush Administration shares Wilmut's vision; quite the contrary. In his State of the Union message President Bush said attempting to make cloned embryos was an egregious abuse of medical research and asked Congress to prohibit it. Joe Palca, NPR News.

I'm Michele Norris. There's some surprising news about low-fat diets in tomorrow's Journal of the American Medical Association. Three studies of post-menopausal women show low- fat diets don't prevent heart disease, breast cancer, or colon cancer. Two years ago, the same studies showed that hormone replacement therapy didn't prevent disease. NPR's Patricia Neighmond reports. PATRICIA NEIGHMOND reporting: These studies looked at nearly 50,000 women over the age of 50; about half the women received nutritional counseling recommending they lower the amount of fat in their diet, the other half ate their usual diets. After eight years, researchers found no significant difference between the two groups in their risk of heart disease, breast cancer, or colon cancer. Researchers caution this doesn't mean a low fat diet doesn't provide benefit. There are a number of caveats in the studies. First, heart disease. Epidemiologist Barbara Howard says women were told only to reduce the overall amount of fat in their diet. Dr. BARBARA HOWARD (Epidemiologist): They weren't told, well, try to cut the saturated fat, replace it with the good fats, with the polys (sic). So the polys dropped. So you see, you sort of, you didn't drop the bad fat that much, and, you dropped one of the good fats. And so the net result was there wasn't much change in saturated fat. That led to very small change in LDL, and therefore, very little improvement of heart disease. NEIGHMOND: Polyunsaturated fats help lower bad cholesterol. These are fats from vegetable oils, nuts and fish. Had the women eaten more of this type of fat, Howard says, there might have been bigger benefits. Saturated fats are the most dangerous ones, she says, and whether they know it or not, most Americans have benefited from less of this type of fat in food. Dr. HOWARD: When you go to McDonald's or any fast food restaurant now, things are all fried in non-lard, they're not animal fats. Years ago, they were all lard. Lard was the thing that was used in all of these, or Crisco. An Oreo cookie, years ago, was made with Crisco. Now it's made with an unsaturated fat. Then came the lower fat dairy products, so that a lot of times people, even passively, wind up with less than whole milk, less cream. NEIGHMOND: As for a low fat diet and a risk of breast cancer, again there was no significant difference among women. Researcher Ross Prentice says there were differences among certain groups of women. Those who participated most actively in nutrition classes saw a greater decrease in breast cancer risk. So did those who ate diets with the highest amount of fat to begin with. Dr. ROSS PRENTICE (Biostatistician): The group with higher than, say, 35%, they made a bigger dietary change. They had more room to get down to the dietary goals and they also show stronger evidence of a reduction in breast cancer risk. NEIGHMOND: In addition, Prentice says, following these women for a longer period of time might well show differences in breast cancer risk. So too, when it comes to colon cancer. Epidemiologist Shirley Beresford says there was a significant decrease in polyps in the colon and rectum among women who maintained a low fat diet. And in longer follow up, she says, researchers may well see a decrease in colorectal cancer itself. In addition, Beresford adds that the dietary changes in this study were made among women over the age of 50. Dr. SHIRLEY BERESFORD (Epidemiology, Washington State University): It would not be an unreasonable inference to say these women had been consuming high levels of fat in their diet for maybe 40 years. You know, maybe the influence of the past 40 years can't be eradicated in even a long intervention study that goes on for about eight years. NEIGHMOND: Healthy, low fat, high fiber diets may be most beneficial, says Beresford, when started as early in life as possible. Researchers will continue to follow all these women and their diets and incidence of disease for another five years. Patricia Neighmond, NPR News.

The most famous of all the giant meat-eating predators that walked the Earth, that would be Tyrannosaurus Rex of course, actually they started out rather small, at least as dinosaurs go. That is evident from the latest fossil discovery from China, what's believed to be the earliest ancestor of T-Rex. The creature was a mere ten feet long and it sported a large crest on top of its head. NPR's Christopher Joyce introduces us to Guanlong, the crowned dragon. CHRISTOPHER JOYCE: It was just over a year ago when scientists announced they'd found the oldest ancestor of Tyrannosaurus Rex; a feathered dinosaur from China. Now scientists have discovered the bones of an even older ancestor. It was toothy to be sure, but about one fourth the size of T. Rex. And says lead scientist James Clark of George Washington University, it wasn't alone. JAMES CLARK: We have two skeletons preserved. The larger one lying on top of the smaller one. Their ages are seven and 12 old. As far as its distance from Tyrannosaurus, it's actually more than 90 million years older than Tyrannosaurus Rex. JOYCE: Guanlong suggests that nature stuck to a basic design that worked for predators. But this discovery suggests that over time evolution apparently favored living large. Team member Gregory Erickson is with Florida State University. GREGORY ERICKSON: Maybe it's just a case of these animals sort of, you know, tracking larger prey. You know, if, kind of an arms race could be going on here. As herbivores get larger then it makes a niche for a larger predator. JOYCE: Another mystery about this creature, it had something unique to tyrannosaurs, a large crest on its head like the crest many birds have but bony inside. Tom Holtz, a dinosaur scientist at the University of Maryland, says lots of dinosaurs are believed to have display ornamentation plates along the back, or bony frills around the neck for example. THOMAS HOLTZ: You know, if you have a big showy display structure at least in certain seasons, you've got a lot of color on it to say, you know, hi look at me, I'm ready for breeding, or hey stay away from me I'm dangerous. JOYCE: Scientists say the past decade of dinosaur discoveries, especially in China, has revealed a menagerie of tyrannosaur ancestors. Smaller, quicker, feathered, and now crested. And they were by no means top dog when they started out in the Jurassic Period, some 180 million years ago. HOLTZ: In the cast of the tyrannosauroids, we see they spent a long period of their history as secondary predators, as minor components in the predatory guilds. And it's only at the very end, only the last 15 million years of the Cretaceous, really, that they take off as the top. So, this helps reinforce the idea that the tyrannosaurs that we know and love, the great T. Rex, was, in a sense, a really late experiment. JOYCE: An experiment that came to a screeching halt, fortunately for we mammals, 65 million years ago with the great dinosaur extinction.

Perhaps you're one of them, because it goes against nutritional advice that we have been hearing for years. Here's what happened.  Researchers tracked the eating habits of nearly 50,000 post-menopausal women for eight years. Now, about 40 percent of the women - that's called the Intervention Group - were asked to follow a diet low in fat, high in fruits, vegetables and grains - all those good, healthy things that we've been told we should be eating. The other women didn't change their eating habits at all. Now, the health of the women in both groups were tracked, and after eight years, the researchers found that the women on the low-fat diet had the same risk of developing breast cancer, colon cancer, heart disease and stroke as the group that ate whatever they wanted.  In other words, according to this study at least, following a low-fat diet does not translate into health benefits. But, before you grab that slice of cheesecake, hold on, because researchers say the study results don't mean you can start piling on the fat again. Joining me now to sort it all out are my guests - both my guests took part in the study, and let me introduce them.  Judith Hsia is a professor of medicine at George Washington University in Washington, D. C. She joins us from her office there. Thanks for being with us today, Dr. Hsia. Dr. JUDITH HSIA (Professor of Medicine, George Washington University, Washington, D. C. ): My pleasure. FLATOW: You're welcome. Ross Prentice is a member of the Public Health Sciences Division at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. He's also a professor of biostatistics at the University of Washington in Seattle and he joins us today from L. A.  Thanks for joining us Dr. Prentice. Dr. ROSS PRENTICE (Member, Public Health Sciences Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center; Professor of Biostatistics, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington): Hi, Ira. Thanks for having us on. FLATOW: You're welcome. Dr. Hsia, you know, the headlines, if you listened to the headlines all week, they were saying, hey, you know, you can eat anything you want to -- doesn't matter. True or false? Dr. HSIA: Well, we definitely don't want that to be the message that people are drawing from the study. I think one thing that--there's several important messages to be drawn. One is that it's very important to do these randomized trials because they're the only way that you can really find out what works and what doesn't.  Another thing to bear in mind with this study is that it was designed to find out if eating a low-fat diet would reduce the risk of breast cancer and that's an area that, actually, Dr. Prentice is the best equipped to discuss. But, because we're always promoting low-fat diets for heart disease prevention, we also investigated whether or not this prevented heart attack and stroke and found that this was not the case. Now, what actually happened was that the women who were in the intervention group reduced their saturated fat consumption from about 13 percent to about 8 percent which is a good amount, and they had a modest reduction in their LDL, which is the bad cholesterol; it went from 133 to 123. So, it did have a favorable effect, but I guess, to me as a cardiologist, the take-home message is eating a healthful diet is important, but it's not the only thing that you need to do. FLATOW: Mm hmm. Ross Prentice were you surprised by the results? Dr. PRENTICE: Of course, we were a little disappointed not to have clear, positive results at this point and time. However, Ira, even though I think a lot of the reporting has been quite good, I believe the headlines have been misleading.  So, whereas the press release from the National Institutes of Health started out Low-fat May Reduce Breast Cancer Risk and May Not Affect Certain Other Diseases, that has mainly been picked up in reports in the media as Low-fat May Not Prevent Cancer and in some cases, Low-fat Doesn't Prevent Cancer or even stronger.  And, I'd also say in relation to your introductory comments that we do not see the study as going against nutritional advice that's been around for years. We studied a particular low-fat diet that didn't try to reduce calories; it attempted to reduce total fat, and also to increase fruits and vegetables, and grains.  So, it was a change of the composition of the diet and as Dr. Hsia mentioned, our primary interest was breast cancer and some of the motivating data, especially from international comparisons where disease rates vary greatly and correlated with the dietary fat habits in particular countries--some of those same trends we saw for colorectal cancer as for breast cancer, so we also studied colorectal cancer. And then in preliminary studies of this particular low-fat eating pattern conducted in the 1980s under the National Cancer Institute auspices, we noted that there was some modest reduction in blood cholesterol, so coronary heart disease was added as a secondary outcome.  But, it's important for your listeners to realize that this was a study primarily focusing on cancer reduction and we actually see our most important results as quite encouraging there, even though not definitive. So, as Dr. Hsia alluded, in breast cancer, we saw a 9 percent lower rate of breast cancer in the low-fat group versus the usual diet group. That is a favorable trend which is not quite statistically significant, but it's actually quite consistent with our expectation going in when one takes account of the amount of dietary difference between the two groups. FLATOW: But Dr. Prentice, you can't argue with the fact about the results of the diet and pertaining not just to cancer, but to the health of the participants, meaning that there was not a significant difference. Dr. PRENTICE: So, we have to explain what significant difference means. It's statistically significant so. . . For example, for breast cancer we have a 9 percent lower rate in the low-fat group versus usual diet group - not quite statistically significant. If it had been 10 percent that would have been statistically significant, so we're close to it being able to assert a benefit for breast cancer and that's why we're - one of the reasons for an additional five years of follow-up which we hope will allow a stronger positive statement in due time. FLATOW: Dr. Hsia, do you understand the public's confusion with this study? Dr. HSIA: Oh, absolutely and, in fact, in this week's Circulation there's a survey that was carried out to find out what obstacles are to women's embarking on healthful interventions and, actually, the number one cause was confusion about media reports (laughs) so this may be a classic example. I think that really, the underlying message is for breast cancer prevention, for cardiovascular prevention, that it's not that diet is not important and not helpful, but it's not the only thing you need to do.  So, you need to attain your ideal body weight, exercise regularly, stop smoking, have your cholesterol, your blood pressure and your, you know--if you have diabetes--under good control, and as far as breast cancer prevention is concerned, you know, it's been shown that for high-risk women that interventions like tamoxifen reduce the likelihood of breast cancer and, of course, people should get appropriate cancer screening.  So, I think that the concept that if you eat a healthy diet, you don't need to worry about anything else, is not correct. You know, you need to do more. FLATOW: Mm hmm. Would it be possible and would it be prudent now to go into other long-term studies like--just off the top of my head--like the Framingham Study and look to see if the results there back up what this study says? Dr. PRENTICE: So, I could respond Ira, if you wish. FLATOW: Sure. Dr. PRENTICE: One of the challenges in nutritional epidemiology and physical activity epidemiology are the measurement issues, so the usual types of studies we do, like the Framingham Cohort Study, rely very directly on the ability of individuals to accurately report their dietary habits. The fact that that is such a challenge--people report differently at two different points in time, different groups of people may report differently depending on their body mass or ethnicity, or other characteristics--that's actually one of the motivations for this type of expensive, randomized, controlled trial; an actual experiment where women were taught how to make and maintain a dietary change. (Unintelligible). FLATOW: (Unintelligible) Dr. PRENTICE: Sorry, go ahead. FLATOW: Yeah, I know it's hard to go back and see, you know, the control for food. People tell you all kinds of stuff when you ask 'em what they ate (unintelligible). Dr. PRENTICE:  Right, and this type of study design doesn't depend nearly so strongly on the dietary assessment data.  FLATOW: Mm hmm. Dr. PRENTICE: So we had two groups that by design are equivalent at the beginning in their health risks. . . FLATOW: Mm hmmm. Dr. PRENTICE: . . . and we simply compare those two groups in terms of the disease incidence that occurs over the years of follow-up of the study. FLATOW: If you were to design this study again, today because this is eight years ago or at least. . . Dr. PRENTICE: Right. FLATOW: . . . would you do it differently? Would you measure different things? I mean now we know more about trans fats. We didn't talk about them in those days, things like that. Would you try to look between the lines at different kinds of oils that they might have. . . Dr. PRENTICE: I'll start, Judith, if it's okay and you can. . .  Dr. HSIA: Sure. Dr. PRENTICE: So, if the focus was still primarily on breast cancer prevention, I don't think we have a particularly better idea in terms of a dietary intervention. FLATOW: Mm hmmm. Dr. PRENTICE: Of course we think total calories consumed is likely quite important. Some combination of calories consumed and energy expended simply has to be important. That drives obesity and all these are obesity-related diseases. If one was doing a study with a high priority on coronary heart disease and other cardiovascular diseases, as Dr. Hsia already mentioned, one would want to focus more specifically on saturated and trans-fat reduction, where the epidemiologic data is quite strong. FLATOW: Dr. Hsia? Dr. HSIA: Well, I think one thing to bear in mind is that the amount of reduction in the bad cholesterol that women got in our study was about eight percent. And if you take the starting dose of a cholesterol-lowering drug, you can get 40 to 50 percent LDL reduction. So, you know, although diet is useful in, particularly in maintaining ideal body weight, which is a challenge to, you know, all of us and to America as a public health issue, that the amount of impact that you can have on some of these risk factors with lifestyle interventions and diet in particular is limited. And although. . . FLATOW: Right, we've been hearing that for years from doctors that say. . . Dr. HSIA: Well, but I. . . FLATOW: Your liver, your liver likes to make cholesterol you know?  (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: You can cut it back a few percentage points but your liver likes to do it. You'll need something else. Dr. HSIA: I think docs say that but I think that patients, you know, patients vary obviously; but there's a great tendency to think that well if I was more assiduous in my diet, I could really, you know be off these drugs. And in many cases that's not true.  FLATOW: Mm hmmm. Dr. HSIA: You know the drugs are a proven benefit of preventing heart attacks, stroke and death which is more than we were able to demonstrate in this study. So that I'm a strong promoter of eating a diet that's low in saturated fat for cardiovascular prevention, but it is vital for people to keep their conventional risk factors under control by whatever means are necessary. FLATOW: Mm hmmm. Dr. PRENTICE: I'd like to add, Ira, that. . . FLATOW: Sure. Dr. PRENTICE: . . . important for your listeners to realize that you know this was a particular low-fat diet. There's other low-fat diets. There's many other important questions in dietary prevention of disease that may include calorie reduction and other modifications haven't been subjected to this type of rigorous randomized control trials yet. FLATOW: Mm hmmm. I want to thank you both for taking time to talk with us today.

He's also a professor of biostatistics at the University of Washington in Seattle and he joins us today from L. A.  Thanks for joining us Dr. Prentice.  Dr. ROSS PRENTICE (Member, Public Health Sciences Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center; Professor of Biostatistics, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington): Hi, Ira. Thanks for having us on.  FLATOW: You're welcome.  Dr. Hsia, you know, the headlines, if you listened to the headlines all week, they were saying, hey, you know, you can eat anything you want to -- doesn't matter. True or false?  Dr. HSIA: Well, we definitely don't want that to be the message that people are drawing from the study. I think one thing that--there's several important messages to be drawn. One is that it's very important to do these randomized trials because they're the only way that you can really find out what works and what doesn't.   Another thing to bear in mind with this study is that it was designed to find out if eating a low-fat diet would reduce the risk of breast cancer and that's an area that, actually, Dr. Prentice is the best equipped to discuss. But, because we're always promoting low-fat diets for heart disease prevention, we also investigated whether or not this prevented heart attack and stroke and found that this was not the case.  Now, what actually happened was that the women who were in the intervention group reduced their saturated fat consumption from about 13 percent to about 8 percent which is a good amount, and they had a modest reduction in their LDL, which is the bad cholesterol; it went from 133 to 123. So, it did have a favorable effect, but I guess, to me as a cardiologist, the take-home message is eating a healthful diet is important, but it's not the only thing that you need to do.  FLATOW: Mm hmm. Ross Prentice were you surprised by the results?  Dr. PRENTICE: Of course, we were a little disappointed not to have clear, positive results at this point and time. However, Ira, even though I think a lot of the reporting has been quite good, I believe the headlines have been misleading.   So, whereas the press release from the National Institutes of Health started out Low-fat May Reduce Breast Cancer Risk and May Not Affect Certain Other Diseases, that has mainly been picked up in reports in the media as Low-fat May Not Prevent Cancer and in some cases, Low-fat Doesn't Prevent Cancer or even stronger.   And, I'd also say in relation to your introductory comments that we do not see the study as going against nutritional advice that's been around for years. We studied a particular low-fat diet that didn't try to reduce calories; it attempted to reduce total fat, and also to increase fruits and vegetables, and grains.   So, it was a change of the composition of the diet and as Dr. Hsia mentioned, our primary interest was breast cancer and some of the motivating data, especially from international comparisons where disease rates vary greatly and correlated with the dietary fat habits in particular countries--some of those same trends we saw for colorectal cancer as for breast cancer, so we also studied colorectal cancer. And then in preliminary studies of this particular low-fat eating pattern conducted in the 1980s under the National Cancer Institute auspices, we noted that there was some modest reduction in blood cholesterol, so coronary heart disease was added as a secondary outcome.   But, it's important for your listeners to realize that this was a study primarily focusing on cancer reduction and we actually see our most important results as quite encouraging there, even though not definitive. So, as Dr. Hsia alluded, in breast cancer, we saw a 9 percent lower rate of breast cancer in the low-fat group versus the usual diet group. That is a favorable trend which is not quite statistically significant, but it's actually quite consistent with our expectation going in when one takes account of the amount of dietary difference between the two groups.  FLATOW: But Dr. Prentice, you can't argue with the fact about the results of the diet and pertaining not just to cancer, but to the health of the participants, meaning that there was not a significant difference.  Dr. PRENTICE: So, we have to explain what significant difference means. It's statistically significant so. . . For example, for breast cancer we have a 9 percent lower rate in the low-fat group versus usual diet group - not quite statistically significant. If it had been 10 percent that would have been statistically significant, so we're close to it being able to assert a benefit for breast cancer and that's why we're - one of the reasons for an additional five years of follow-up which we hope will allow a stronger positive statement in due time.  FLATOW: Dr. Hsia, do you understand the public's confusion with this study?  Dr. HSIA: Oh, absolutely and, in fact, in this week's Circulation there's a survey that was carried out to find out what obstacles are to women's embarking on healthful interventions and, actually, the number one cause was confusion about media reports (laughs) so this may be a classic example. I think that really, the underlying message is for breast cancer prevention, for cardiovascular prevention, that it's not that diet is not important and not helpful, but it's not the only thing you need to do.   So, you need to attain your ideal body weight, exercise regularly, stop smoking, have your cholesterol, your blood pressure and your, you know--if you have diabetes--under good control, and as far as breast cancer prevention is concerned, you know, it's been shown that for high-risk women that interventions like tamoxifen reduce the likelihood of breast cancer and, of course, people should get appropriate cancer screening.   So, I think that the concept that if you eat a healthy diet, you don't need to worry about anything else, is not correct. You know, you need to do more.  FLATOW: Mm hmm. Would it be possible and would it be prudent now to go into other long-term studies like--just off the top of my head--like the Framingham Study and look to see if the results there back up what this study says?  Dr. PRENTICE: So, I could respond Ira, if you wish.  FLATOW: Sure.  Dr. PRENTICE: One of the challenges in nutritional epidemiology and physical activity epidemiology are the measurement issues, so the usual types of studies we do, like the Framingham Cohort Study, rely very directly on the ability of individuals to accurately report their dietary habits. The fact that that is such a challenge--people report differently at two different points in time, different groups of people may report differently depending on their body mass or ethnicity, or other characteristics--that's actually one of the motivations for this type of expensive, randomized, controlled trial; an actual experiment where women were taught how to make and maintain a dietary change. (Unintelligible).  FLATOW: (Unintelligible)  Dr. PRENTICE: Sorry, go ahead.  FLATOW: Yeah, I know it's hard to go back and see, you know, the control for food. People tell you all kinds of stuff when you ask 'em what they ate (unintelligible).  Dr. PRENTICE:  Right, and this type of study design doesn't depend nearly so strongly on the dietary assessment data.   FLATOW: Mm hmm.  Dr. PRENTICE: So we had two groups that by design are equivalent at the beginning in their health risks. . .  FLATOW: Mm hmmm.  Dr. PRENTICE: . . . and we simply compare those two groups in terms of the disease incidence that occurs over the years of follow-up of the study.  FLATOW: If you were to design this study again, today because this is eight years ago or at least. . .  Dr. PRENTICE: Right.  FLATOW: . . . would you do it differently? Would you measure different things? I mean now we know more about trans fats. We didn't talk about them in those days, things like that. Would you try to look between the lines at different kinds of oils that they might have. . .  Dr. PRENTICE: I'll start, Judith, if it's okay and you can. . .   Dr. HSIA: Sure.  Dr. PRENTICE: So, if the focus was still primarily on breast cancer prevention, I don't think we have a particularly better idea in terms of a dietary intervention.  FLATOW: Mm hmmm.  Dr. PRENTICE: Of course we think total calories consumed is likely quite important. Some combination of calories consumed and energy expended simply has to be important. That drives obesity and all these are obesity-related diseases.  If one was doing a study with a high priority on coronary heart disease and other cardiovascular diseases, as Dr. Hsia already mentioned, one would want to focus more specifically on saturated and trans-fat reduction, where the epidemiologic data is quite strong.  FLATOW: Dr. Hsia?  Dr. HSIA: Well, I think one thing to bear in mind is that the amount of reduction in the bad cholesterol that women got in our study was about eight percent. And if you take the starting dose of a cholesterol-lowering drug, you can get 40 to 50 percent LDL reduction. So, you know, although diet is useful in, particularly in maintaining ideal body weight, which is a challenge to, you know, all of us and to America as a public health issue, that the amount of impact that you can have on some of these risk factors with lifestyle interventions and diet in particular is limited. And although. . .  FLATOW: Right, we've been hearing that for years from doctors that say. . .  Dr. HSIA: Well, but I. . .  FLATOW: Your liver, your liver likes to make cholesterol you know?   (Soundbite of laughter)  FLATOW: You can cut it back a few percentage points but your liver likes to do it. You'll need something else.  Dr. HSIA: I think docs say that but I think that patients, you know, patients vary obviously; but there's a great tendency to think that well if I was more assiduous in my diet, I could really, you know be off these drugs. And in many cases that's not true.   FLATOW: Mm hmmm.  Dr. HSIA: You know the drugs are a proven benefit of preventing heart attacks, stroke and death which is more than we were able to demonstrate in this study. So that I'm a strong promoter of eating a diet that's low in saturated fat for cardiovascular prevention, but it is vital for people to keep their conventional risk factors under control by whatever means are necessary.  FLATOW: Mm hmmm.  Dr. PRENTICE: I'd like to add, Ira, that. . .  FLATOW: Sure.  Dr. PRENTICE: . . . important for your listeners to realize that you know this was a particular low-fat diet. There's other low-fat diets. There's many other important questions in dietary prevention of disease that may include calorie reduction and other modifications haven't been subjected to this type of rigorous randomized control trials yet.  FLATOW: Mm hmmm. I want to thank you both for taking time to talk with us today. Ross Prentice is a member of the Public Health Sciences division at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and also professor of biostatistics, University of Washington in Seattle. And Judith Hsia is a professor of medicine at George Washington University in Washington. Thank you again for taking time to be with us.  Dr. HSIA: Thank you.  Dr. PRENTICE: Pleasure.

Welcome back to the program, Dr. Seides. Dr. STUART F. SEIDES (Associate director of cardiology, Washington Hospital Center): Thank you. SIEGEL: What we heard first from the hospital is that Mr. Whittington has had a minor heart attack caused by a pellet, an irregularity in the heartbeat caused by a pellet. How serious is that? Dr. SEIDES: Well, much like yourself, what I know is what I have heard from the media, and obviously I've not had an opportunity to review his medical records. My understanding is that there was a pellet that migrated and touched off a rhythm disturbance due to irritation because of its proximity to the heart, and then the notion of a heart attack. An arrhythmia or rhythm disturbance does not always cause a heart attack, but a heart attack is generally defined by some damage to the heart muscle, and that was presumably detected by some release of enzymes or proteins in the blood stream. The doctor seemed to be emphasizing that it's a minor attack, which would mean that the amount of damage was small. SIEGEL: The chief of emergency care at the hospital in Corpus Christi called it, and I quote, \"a silent heart attack, an asymptomatic heart attack. \" He's not had a heart attack in the traditional sense. Dr. SEIDES: Well, you know, heart attack is a lay term, and by its nature imprecise. I think he meant, when he used the word silent, that Mr. Whittington did not have any of the traditional signs and symptoms of a person having a heart attack, and those would include the typical squeezing, chest discomfort under the breastbone, and so forth. But of course Mr. Whittington was shot in the chest, so he might not notice that type of discomfort as distinct. SIEGEL: If there is a very small piece of this birdshot, to use the words of the hospital director, lodged into part of the man's heart, is that something that one can leave there? I mean, is it, I've heard about people who have had bullets and other tissue in their body for a long time, it would just stay there. Do you leave it there, or do you have to go in, do you think, and operate and extract it? Dr. SEIDES: Not necessarily. You know, again, birdshot is very, very tiny, and it would be conceivable that it would remain stationary and then become encapsulated. You know, the body is very clever when it senses a foreign body and tends to wall it off and encapsulate it. Whether or not it needs to be removed is a clinical question that will be determined as the days go on. You know, one thing that one would have to remember is that finding the thing would not be that easy, I don't believe. You know, we're talking about something that is very small, and while it may be easy to see on an X-ray, it might not be that easy to find, and of course you'd have to do an open chest exploration, which would be a fair undertaking in a man of 78 years. SIEGEL: The hospital administrator said that Mr. Whittington will probably stay in the hospital for another week so that they can make sure that shot doesn't move to other organs or to another part of his body. What's the organ that you would be most concerned about right now? Dr. SEIDES: Well, again, you know, I have not seen his X-rays, nor do I know what the pattern of the scattershot is. But I presume that what they would be looking for is for the shot that is in there to be stable, not move, be walled off, not erode into the cavity or chambers of the heart, where it could do a great deal of damage. In other words, if the shot made its way into the bloodstream, it could then potentially travel with the bloodstream and create a great deal of mischief. And so I think what they're talking about is having it be stable. And then once it's stable for a period of time, again, the body will tend to wall it off and it will tend not to migrate any further. SIEGEL: So there could be a full recovery from this, without a major heart operation, conceivably. Dr. SEIDES: Conceivably, I think that could be the case. SIEGEL: Dr. Seides, thanks a lot for talking with us once again. Dr. SEIDES: A pleasure, as always.

I'm Michele Norris. ROBERT SIEGEL, host: And I'm Robert Siegel. Research on embryonic stem cells is controversial in this country. President Bush has called the effort to make those cells from cloned human embryos and egregious abuse of medical research. On the other side of the Atlantic, the situation is radically different. The British Government has embraced stem cell research largely for its potential to provide cures for diseases. NPR's Joe Palca reports. JOE PALCA reporting: London has long been one of the world's financial capitals. The British government hopes a new bank recently opened in a London suburb will make it a capital of biology as well. The National Institute for Biological Standards and Control is in Potter's Bar. Fifteen minutes by fast train from London's King's Cross Station. It's the home of the UK stem cell bank. Mr. LYNN STACEY(ph) (UK Stem Cell Bank Manager): What you can see here is that you've got the cleaning corridor. On the other side are three dedicated laboratories. PALCA: Lynn Stacey is the bank manager as it were. It's the bank's job to store, maintain and distribute stem cells. In particular, embryonic stem cells. Human embryonic stem cells have unique properties. Under the right circumstances, they can turn into any cell type in the body. Skin, heart, nerve, you name it. Researchers plan to use these stem cells to study diseases, and perhaps even replace damaged cells as a way of treating diseases. Mr. STACEY: It's been noisy in here. PALCA: Powerful air conditioners draw air through thick filters to make sure inside the lab is as clean as possible. There are 24 embryonic stem cell lines already on deposit. They come from scientists in the UK, Australia and interestingly enough, Harvard University in the United States. Mr. STACEY: Deposits will have a shop window which everyone in the world can look at and see the quality of the cells, and pick the cells they want. PALCA: Once scientists make a selection, they can take the cells back to their labs and start using them for their research. One of the scientists looking in that shop window will be Chris Shaw. Shaw is a neurologist. His office is in the Institute of Psychiatry at King's College, London. He works on ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's Disease. It's a terrible illness. Mr. CHRIS SHAW (Neurologist, Institute of Psychiatry, Kings College, London): It usually starts quite insidiously with weakness in the hand or foot, and people often think it's something quite trivial or minor. PALCA: Shaw says over time nerve cells called motor neuron stop functioning. You lose your ability to walk, to feed yourself, even to breath on your own. Mr. SHAW: One of the hardest things, the most isolating things is you lose the ability to communicate. You can't speak to somebody to tell them how you feel, and you can't touch them and show them how you feel. It's a very difficult illness to deal with. PALCA: And right now there's little doctors can do besides watch the inexorable decline. ALS is a hard disease to study. And embryonic stem cells might help. Scientists would like to investigate a patient's motor neurons in the laboratory to try to find out why they stop working. But Shaw says it's hard to get your hands on motor neurons since patients need the ones they've got. Mr. SHAW: We do know that embryonic stem cells can be directed very clearly and very definitively to become motor neurons in culture and behave like most neurons. So we know that if we can get the human embryonic stem cells, we can probably derive motor neurons. PALCA: Among other things, Shaw hopes embryonic stem cells will make it easier to test new drugs that might improve a patient's symptoms. In the United States, embryonic stem cell research is controversial. In Britain it's not. Steve Jones thinks he knows why. Mr. STEVE JONES (Geneticist/Writer, University College, London): What made Britain great was apathy, there's no question. This is the most passionately apathetic nation in the world, I think. PALCA: Jones is a geneticist and writer at the University College, London. Mr. JONES: We like to feel strongly about absolutely nothing. That's a strength and weakness, but in this case, I think it's rather strength. PALCA: Jones says the reason it's a strength is that opponents of embryonic stem cell research, and they do exist in Britain, can't inflame passions against research most people favor the way they have in the U. S. Mr. JONES: What's actually happened is this, sort of, perhaps slightly false consensus has emerged. That the great and the good who think the way they ought to think are being appointed, and those who are awkward have been marginalized. So it isn't all perfect, and it is somewhat marked by politics. But it's not completely blotted by stupidity the way it is in the United States. PALCA: A lot of people in Britain can't understand why, if there's such strong opposition to embryonic stem cells in the United States, there's no federal legislation prohibiting or even regulating it.  The British decision to fund embryonic stem cell research came after a long national debate about the ethics of this kind of research. And the ethics is still a frequent conversation topic. Unidentified Male #1: What do you want to drink Harry? Mr. HARRY MOORE (Sheffield University Ethics Program): Oh just Coke please. PALCA: Harry Moore is having lunch with some colleagues from Sheffield University's ethics program. Unidentified Female #1: Bag chips and teas? PALCA: Sheffield is in the North of England. It's a center for stem cell research. Moore is a reproductive biologist with the University Stem Cell Program. Inevitably the lunchtime chat turns to questions about the moral and legal status of a human embryo. Unidentified Male Host #2: Yes it's functionally an embryo, meaning it can develop into this kind of person. PALCA: To get a human embryonic stem cell line, you have to destroy a human embryo. But there are many thousands of embryos sitting in freezers around the world. Fertility doctors created these embryos to help infertile couples have babies. Typically more embryos are made than can be used. Proponents of stem cell research say these embryos will ultimately be discarded, so why not use them to help find treatments for disease? Indeed Moore and his colleagues are already preparing for the day when embryonic stem cells will be used to treat disease. Mr. MOORE: This is the first stage room. So you take off ordinary clothes here. PALCA: We're in a suite of laboratories in the campus hospital, just down the hall from the IBF Clinic. This is where Moore and his colleagues will make embryonic stem cells in the kind of carefully controlled conditions needed to make new therapies. To go inside, we have to zip into clean white jumpsuits made of a special material that doesn't shed the tiny particles that typically fall off our clothes. Mr. MOORE: These are analogue, so it's positive pressure. So you have a cascade of air pressures from your inner sanctum to outside. PALCA: The idea is to make sure all the air is filtered to avoid the possibility of contamination. Even in this outer room, things look incredibly clean, but we have to go through yet another air lock to get into the inner most lab. Inside there are a few lab benches and a couple of refrigerators. In this room, scientist will extract the precious clump of cells from an embryo and with luck, coax them to start dividing in a laboratory making a new embryonic stem cell line. Mr. MOORE: Once we have the cell line, it can be frozen. And we can then use it later when we have a therapy. PALCA: Notice Moore says when, not if. Right now there are no therapies based on embryonic stem cells. Mr. MOORE: I think it is imperative that we create stem cell lines now that could be used in the future for therapy. PALCA: So you just built and are commissioning a two and half million dollar facility against the hope that someday it will be useful? Mr. MOORE: Yes, basically yes. PALCA: It's a gamble the UK government thinks is worth taking. Even if the medical payoff is many years off. Joe Palca, NPR News.  MICHELE NORRIS, host:  From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED.

Mr. STEVE JONES (Geneticist/Writer, University College, London): What made Britain great was apathy, there's no question. This is the most passionately apathetic nation in the world, I think.  PALCA: Jones is a geneticist and writer at the University College, London.  Mr. JONES: We like to feel strongly about absolutely nothing. That's a strength and weakness, but in this case, I think it's rather strength.  PALCA: Jones says the reason it's a strength is that opponents of embryonic stem cell research, and they do exist in Britain, can't inflame passions against research most people favor the way they have in the U. S.  Mr. JONES: What's actually happened is this, sort of, perhaps slightly false consensus has emerged. That the great and the good who think the way they ought to think are being appointed, and those who are awkward have been marginalized. So it isn't all perfect, and it is somewhat marked by politics. But it's not completely blotted by stupidity the way it is in the United States.  PALCA: A lot of people in Britain can't understand why, if there's such strong opposition to embryonic stem cells in the United States, there's no federal legislation prohibiting or even regulating it.  The British decision to fund embryonic stem cell research came after a long national debate about the ethics of this kind of research. And the ethics is still a frequent conversation topic.  Unidentified Male #1: What do you want to drink Harry?  Mr. HARRY MOORE (Sheffield University Ethics Program): Oh just Coke please.  PALCA: Harry Moore is having lunch with some colleagues from Sheffield University's ethics program.  Unidentified Female #1: Bag chips and teas?  PALCA: Sheffield is in the North of England. It's a center for stem cell research. Moore is a reproductive biologist with the University Stem Cell Program. Inevitably the lunchtime chat turns to questions about the moral and legal status of a human embryo.  Unidentified Male Host #2: Yes it's functionally an embryo, meaning it can develop into this kind of person.  PALCA: To get a human embryonic stem cell line, you have to destroy a human embryo. But there are many thousands of embryos sitting in freezers around the world. Fertility doctors created these embryos to help infertile couples have babies. Typically more embryos are made than can be used.  Proponents of stem cell research say these embryos will ultimately be discarded, so why not use them to help find treatments for disease? Indeed Moore and his colleagues are already preparing for the day when embryonic stem cells will be used to treat disease.  Mr. MOORE: This is the first stage room. So you take off ordinary clothes here.  PALCA: We're in a suite of laboratories in the campus hospital, just down the hall from the IBF Clinic. This is where Moore and his colleagues will make embryonic stem cells in the kind of carefully controlled conditions needed to make new therapies. To go inside, we have to zip into clean white jumpsuits made of a special material that doesn't shed the tiny particles that typically fall off our clothes.  Mr. MOORE: These are analogue, so it's positive pressure. So you have a cascade of air pressures from your inner sanctum to outside.  PALCA: The idea is to make sure all the air is filtered to avoid the possibility of contamination. Even in this outer room, things look incredibly clean, but we have to go through yet another air lock to get into the inner most lab. Inside there are a few lab benches and a couple of refrigerators. In this room, scientist will extract the precious clump of cells from an embryo and with luck, coax them to start dividing in a laboratory making a new embryonic stem cell line.  Mr. MOORE: Once we have the cell line, it can be frozen. And we can then use it later when we have a therapy.  PALCA: Notice Moore says when, not if. Right now there are no therapies based on embryonic stem cells.  Mr. MOORE: I think it is imperative that we create stem cell lines now that could be used in the future for therapy.  PALCA: So you just built and are commissioning a two and half million dollar facility against the hope that someday it will be useful?  Mr. MOORE: Yes, basically yes.  PALCA: It's a gamble the UK government thinks is worth taking. Even if the medical payoff is many years off. Joe Palca, NPR News. ", "section": "Science", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2006 NPR.

I'm Ira Flatow. France gets about 75 percent of its electricity from nuclear power. Here in the U. S. that number is less than a third of that. France has brought 58 nuclear plants online in the last 30 years. The U. S. hasn't ordered any new plants here since the 1970s following the Three Mile Island accident. But that may all be changing. President Bush has said that he wants to see an increased emphasis on nuclear power here in the U. S. including starting construction on new plants by the end of the decade. But is this country ready for nuclear power? Has the technology improved to the point where concerns over issues such as safety and waste disposal can be addressed? Where the phrase, Not in my back yard strikes fear in the heart of politicians is there a political will to build new plants? On the other hand, ironically we are seeing environmentalists who once were rigidly opposed to nuclear power, some of them are now saying that compared to global warming, nuclear energy poses a much less threat. It's really the lesser of two evils. Will all of this be enough to reinvigorate the call to go nuclear? What do you think? We'll be debating our nuclear energy proposal this hour. Do you think we should be revising nuclear energy in the United States? What do you think about it? Our number is 1-800-989-8255, 1-800-989-TALK. Let me introduce my guests. David Modeen is the vice president of the nuclear division for the Electric Power Research Institute or EPRI. He's based in Charlotte, North Carolina. He's joining us from our Washington studios. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. Mr. DAVID MODEEN (Vice President, Nuclear Division, Electric Power Research Institute, EPRI): Thank you, Ira. FLATOW: Arjun Makhijani is the president of the Institute for the Energy and Environmental Research in Takoma Park, Maryland. Welcome back to the program. Mr. ARJUN MAKHIJANI (President, Institute for Energy and Environmental Research, IEER): Thank you, Ira. FLATOW: Let's talk, gentlemen, about this. It appears inevitable, does it not, that the government is going ahead, Dave, with the press toward more nuclear power. Mr. MODEEN: Yes, I think very much so and there's a number of reasons. And I think at least trying to address greenhouse gas emissions is only one of many factors that really led, I think to the Bush Administration to come out so strongly in favor of nuclear energy. FLATOW: In fact I'm reading from an article in Physics Today where it talks about the U. S. Congress's 2005 energy bill has tax credits worth $3. 1 billion in it. It gives something important, which is liability protection, which the nuclear industry lost following Three Mile Island. One of the things they couldn't get was insurance following that, correct? Mr. MODEEN: No, I don't believe that is correct. There's been an act, in fact, the industry is self-insuring in the structure that the government puts in place that really has a model. It's essentially a no fault insurance to handle costs from such accidents, and that's been in place for the history of the commercial program. FLATOW: So, why haven't there been new nuclear power plants? Mr. MODEEN: I think, quite frankly, until the beginning of the 90s, we did not operate the plants as well as we do today. We've had a steady increase in the efficiency and the effectiveness today where the fleet-wide average is 90 percent efficiency. It's the lowest cost-based generation by all metrics both industry and government it's as safe or safer today than it's ever been. FLATOW: Arjun, your reaction. Mr. MAKHIJANI: Yes, well, first of all, I'm very glad that this sudden soft corner that we should do something about global warming. Because I agree that it's a gigantic and perhaps the most important environmental problem humanity has ever faced. In order to address it to the level of France, we need about 700 or 800 nuclear power plants here in the next 50, if you want 75 to 80 percent in this country. It's much bigger than France with a much bigger electricity sector. That's about maybe two a month, or three every two months, for the next 40 years. Not an achievable level. In regard to the energy bill, it's very interesting that the nuclear power industry, after half a century of government support, still wants subsidies. Wall Street has no confidence in nuclear power, and although a lot of people are talking about it, nobody's really ordered a reactor yet. And I hope the government doesn't get into the business. They keep saying it's very economical, and the way, we talked about this last time, the way the numbers are put on the table as a capital cost is not included and they say $. 02 a kilowatt hour but Wall Street doesn't agree with that if you include the capital cost, which is most of the cost, then of course government subsidies still appear to be necessary half a century after the start of nuclear power. Otherwise they'd go and order them. Wall Street would be waiting for the ten to twelve percent return on investment that electric power plants are supposed to give. FLATOW: According to this Physics Today article, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission certified the design of a new reactor, a Westinghouse reactor, last December, and they think that order may be forthcoming within the next two years. Mr. MAKHIJANI: Yeah, I think that orders may be forthcoming, the first six. The extent of government subsidies per reactor may be $1 to $2 billion a year. A couple of years ago the Congressional Budget Office estimated that there would be a high likelihood of loan defaults. So, you know, if the government guarantees loans and puts up maybe $5, $10, $12 billion for the first six plants, we'll have six plants. But how far is that going to take us? Our growth in electricity requires 20, 30 plants every year, and we have six plants in ten years, it's really a few drops in the bucket. FLATOW: So, you are arguing that there are not enough plants being ordered? Mr. MAKHIJANI: Well, no, I'm not agreeing, I'm saying that nobody's lining up to really build a lot of nuclear power plants. And to say that nuclear power plants are going to be the answer to the electricity sector's woes and to global warming is, so far at least, in fantasy land. Mr. MODEEN: Ira, if I could? FLATOW: David, yeah. Mr. MODEEN: If I could offer a couple perspectives. First of all, I think it's important for me to note that at EPRI, we advocated a diverse generation portfolio, and nuclear is going to play a key role, but we're also looking very hard and with our member organizations at clean coal, in addition to natural gas, renewables, wind, bio-mass, solar. And strategically for almost any business in the U. S. today, a utility business, you really do need a mix. And so, we don't, I think the view of my members, is that maintaining that 20 percent as our demand for electric energy continues to increase, is very important, and nibbling away, may be increasing a bit. But we're not trying to follow a market penetration like what is in France. FLATOW: But Dave you have two big issues that are still outstanding in the eyes of the public. One is, we don't have a place to put the waste. The Yucca Mountain has not been approved and we don't know where to put the stuff now. And number two, people still have this not in my back yard syndrome. They still don't trust the technology to be safe here as they might in other countries. Mr. MODEEN: Actually, I think as the industry gets its message out, and I've seen this in the last five, six, seven years, and I think that's why there's really this push toward nuclear energy today, is there is a recognition that one, on the safety issue it's a very vast improvement from decades before. And most individuals, and the polls bear this out, are comfortable with nuclear energy. Now on the second piece, yes Yucca Mountain has been a protracted exercise. A very complicated exercise and yet ultimately there needs to be a centralized repository, someplace where the residual used fuel or waste products from that. There has been the debate most recently about if one has a strong growth in the nuclear energy field, what is the role of Yucca Mountain? And in fact, the Bush Administration has new proposals that were just announced in the last, oh, couple weeks that align very well with our longer term vision of what's the appropriate way to handle or dispose this used fuel from the reactors. FLATOW: Arjun? Mr. MAKHIJANI: Yes, actually, I think so far as global warming and any good things that might come of, nuclear energy doesn't emit significant carbon dioxide emissions. So, I think we have a point of agreement there and we should debate this seriously. But the Bush global nuclear energy program is really puts nuclear energy in a much more slippery slope, much more proliferation prone. It creates a kind of a nuclear apartheid in the world. It talks about fuel cycle countries, in a very polite way, nuclear fuel cycle countries where plutonium, which can be trusted with plutonium, and then other countries which are reactor countries. Well, this is like a unilateral amendment of the nonproliferation treaty, which guarantees its parties that they have the \"inalienable right\" to nuclear power. And it isn't going to go down. If you promote the separation of plutonium, and promote nuclear energy, you're going to wind up with uranium enrichment and reprocessing technologies throughout the world. Not I think a very pleasant future to look at. So while we can talk about nuclear power and global warming in the present scheme of things like water reactors, I'm not a fan as you know. But I think this global nuclear energy program of reprocessing plutonium separation, being promoted as proliferation-resistant, when you can make bombs out of the stuff. This is really not a sensible program and many advocates of nuclear energy, I think, are quite skeptical. They're going along because the president is talking about nuclear energy every day. Mr. MODEEN: If I could offer a couple. . . IRA FLATOW: Dave, sure. Mr. MODEEN: Yeah, observations. First of all, I need to be careful that I don't speak for the federal government nor policy for the industry. What I thought was interesting about the global nuclear energy partnership is that EPRI does have a science section amongst our four divisions, and we really pride ourselves in trying to understand the issues to inform the policy debate, and although we would not necessarily sequence things in the order that is promoted in the global nuclear energy partnership, the types of research and development needed, and the types of programs developed to address the very issues of nonproliferation that Dr. Makhijani was referring to, are, you know, very much need to be done before one really signs up for the type of regime I think that is outlined in the G. N. E. P. FLATOW: Can you be more specific. I don't find one fact in that. . . Mr. MODEEN: No, no actually the fact is, that the advance, not the current type of reprocessing that occurs in France or has occurred in the United Kingdom in the past, but in fact, an advanced technology, and what's referred to as an advanced fuel cycle initiative, such that one doesn't result in separation streams of pure plutonium, the real concern of what might be available to a terrorist organization. Otherwise, you mix that, those reprocessing byproducts in such a way that there's no advantage to one that wants to use the isotopes in an inappropriate manner. Dr. MAKHIJANI: You know, terrorists won't care if they're impure plutonium, so long as you can make a chain reaction out of it. Weapon states like the United States, or Russian, or Britain, or China, won't want impure plutonium. They can't make bombs with predictable yields, controlled, you know, the kind of strategies that weaponeers designed when they do their war planning. But I don't terrorists or non-nuclear states do the same kind of war planning. They're into, will it explode? And they don't care if it's one kiloton or ten kilotons. A nuclear fuel, a nuclear fizzle, is several hundred tons of TNT equivalent. And I think for a terrorist fizzle, it would have a huge effect, and proliferating these technologies is not. . . Let's look at France, the sort of model country for plutonium separation. Three quick points. They spend about two cents a kilowatt hour extra for every kilowatt hour they generate from plutonium fuel. This is calculated from their government study with the participation of their atomic energy commission. They reprocess for foreigners, which is something in the new program proposed by President Bush. Well, they reprocess for France, uh, for Japan. Japan has separated plutonium in the commercial sector. And in 2002, Ishiro Osawa (ph), their labor party head said, if China gets something, there's a close quote, not an exact quote, paraphrase, if China gets too uppity, Japan should make thousands of nuclear weapons from its commercial sector plutonium. Now, that's the real world that we are in, once we start separating plutonium. Commercial plutonium was set by Japan to be not suitable for nuclear weapons only 10 years ago, but suddenly they're saying they could make thousands of weapons out of it. FLATOW: We're talking about nuclear power this hour on TALK OF THE NATION SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. Talking with Dave Modeen of EPRI and Arjun Makhijani, who is president of the Institute for Energy and Environmental Research in Tacoma Park. Our number 1800-989-8255. Dave, you wanted to jump in there. . . Mr. MODEEN: Yeah, I wanted to maybe, maybe refocus the discussion a little bit. Because I've had, there are clearly some policy issues, and governmental issues relative to nonproliferation, but I think the point before the country now is that for the first time in a while, we need new base-load generation, about ten years out. We're looking at lots of different options for that. Nuclear happens to be one of them, because of the demonstrated performance of the current plants, and much of the improvements over, and I can enumerate them, but I won't right now, in the last 15, 20 years. And then also the opportunity with these new designs, where we've applied the lessons learned from the past, because we really did ramp up as an industry quite quickly in the '60s and '70s, and it was not a mature technology at that time. And there's any number of things that EPRI involved with the vendors and the utilities, such that the AP 1000 Westinghouse Reactor that you had just mentioned, is even better than what we currently have operating, although we're quite comfortable with the safety record and continued performance of the current plants. FLATOW: What makes these new designs safer than the old. . . ? Mr. MODEEN: Several things. One through operating experience, we've learned in materials performance. For example, materials not to use, heat treatments not to have, chemistry programs not to use, and, again, chemistry programs to use. Maintenance techniques in the accessibility and lay-down areas, such that, you know, we spend a lot of money on operations and maintenance activities at the plant to keep them running almost 24/7 for a year and half, two years in a row. The designs are much more forgiving from, from an accident point of view. And by forgiving I mean they can accommodate a loss of electricity, loss of fluids, because power densities are less, margins are increased, cooling volumes are increased, less number of active components. It's just a large, large number of things. That all, all through the, you know, the trial and error, and kind of fits and starts, especially in the early years of the industry, that we realize we sure don't want to do that again, what's something we can do better? Dr. MAKHIJANI: Ira let me say. . . FLATOW: All right, yeah, I got a minute before the break. Go ahead. Dr. MAKHIJANI: Let me say a couple things about safety. The reason that the industry can claim it is safer, you know, you have to go in and actually discover the small problems before the big problems. I think in the last 10 years we've been asking for trouble. The industry isn't necessarily safer. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has a smaller technical staff, and it is allowing self-inspection and self-regulation, and there have been many problems where we've been very, very close. The Davis Bessie Reactor had a corrosion eat much of the way through the head of the reactor vessel. We were not far from a very, very serious accident. And it turns out, the French had warned the Americans about this problem. There were corrosion problems at a number of plants that were similar, from boric acid. And the Nuclear Regulatory Commission simply wasn't paying attention. What we've got is a situation is where the NRC is much more lax than in the '80s. FLATOW: Alright. Barry, we're going to have to take a break and we'll come back and pick up with the debate over nuclear power. With Dave Modeen and Arjun Makhijani and your questions. Stay with us. We'll be right back. I'm Ira Flatow. This TALK OF THE NATION SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. (Soundbite of music) FLATOW: You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow. We're talking this hour about nuclear energy with my guests. David Modeen is vice president of the nuclear division for the Electric Power Research Institute, or EPRI.

David in Lake Oswego, Oregon. Hi welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. DAVID (Caller): Well, thank you. I've always wondered or maybe it would help people feel a little more safe about nuclear power if they went with sort of a standardized plant instead of each of these one-off plants. Something along the lines of the nuclear facilities they have aboard ships, and that kind of thing. Where, if they had a problem in one, it would instantly tell them hey we've got to check all the other plants to see if the same thing is happening. Somewhat like what they do in jet engines and that kind of thing. FLATOW: That's a good question. I've heard that for years about, and I think people had referred to the success of European, I think France has one, one or two designs for many, many of their plants. Why not go Dave with one design and then be able to sort of know when something's going wrong, maybe to fix the other plants, or to have enough hours of experience with all these plants together when something might go bad? Mr. MODEEN: Yeah, that's actually a very good thought, and it's one that the industry has pursued. In fact in the late '80s and early '90s, EPRI managed an advanced reactor corporation. And the purpose, I had mentioned all these lessons learned from experiences, we defined with our utility advisors and vendors, a utility requirements document, which was essentially a utility specification of what they wanted to see in a new design, with the idea of a standardizing, a lot of focus, in fact the French, the Electricity de France was part of that program. And then from there the vendors have proposed the standardized designs. That AP 1000 is one of those offered by Westinghouse. General Electric has a certified design they built in Asia, they haven't built here, called the Advance Blowing Water Reactor. GE is looking to certify another BWR, a little bit different but again, standardized designs. And then. . . FLATOW: But they're different designs. One company versus another company. Mr. MODEEN: Well, the key difference actually is it's one or two or three, so you have market competition in the U. S. , and trying to extract the best economic price one can get. FLATOW: But sometimes it's just one little component, like in Three Mile Island, just a valve or something that you know could be one of thousands of components, but it's not part of the same design. Mr. MODEEN: Let's see. . . Dr. MAKHIJANI: Could I jump in? FLATOW: Yeah, go ahead. Dr. MAKHIJANI: There are some advantages to having common designs, and you're right. The French actually have three different sizes of reactors. And they, the advantages, there are some disadvantages to common designs, and the French have experienced that also. They, when they discovered this problem of boric acid corrosion, they realized they had to, they had the same design, they had to go back and replace all the reactor heads. And they knew they had a serious safety issue, but they couldn't do it all at once because 75 percent of their electricity come from nuclear. And so if you have the kind of valve that you were talking about that may stick, but you haven't discovered it yet, this is a difficult problem with nuclear. And then changing the design? The AP 1000 does have more important safety features, where there have been lessons learned, I think, in the nuclear industry. However, when you're going to digital design, when you're going to new features, nuclear reactor is not like a car or a jet engine. You can take a jet engine or car and drive it 100,000 miles, or run it for a great number of hours, at full power or over the rated power, and test it to failure, and then put it on real commercial. You can't do that with nuclear energy. That's a problem. Mr. MODEEN: Well, actually we've done that in a lot of integrated test defects, prototypical defects. I think something that the audience needs to keep in mind is that it's a whole team effort in operating a plant. It's not, you know, the men and women that design and maintain and operate these facilities are very dedicated. We do have issues, just like any other large manufacturer or industrial facility. You need to be striving for excellence. I think we have not been satisfied with the status quo. Things will, you need to learn from those lessons and move on, but I think the industry's safety record really speaks for itself. Even Three Mile Island, as much as, I don't like going back there, there were any number of mistakes done there, and yet from the defense in-depth of that plant, I mean it was very much an economic disaster for the company, but in the long run, it was not an impact to society. FLATOW: Let's go to the phones. Let's go to Brenda, in New Haven. Hi Brenda. BRENDA (Caller): Hi, Ira. Thanks for taking my call. I have a couple of questions. First of all, if they do go ahead and build these, I personally would like to see them put closer to the end-use point because, I live in Oswego County. We have three nuke plants. All of our power goes into the northeast grid, none of it is used here. And I've been told by people that work for National Grid that as much as 40 to 50 percent of the power is lost in transmission. Now to me, that's doubling how much electricity we actually have to generate, because we're not putting it where the people are using it. The other thing is, I mean, there's a big plume of, you know, water vapor going up into the air, day after day after day. I know it's not talked about, but I remember when I was learning about global warming, water vapor was considered a greenhouse gas. And what about all that heat that's being added to the atmosphere, how is that not having an impact on global warming? FLATOW: Dave Modeen? Mr. MODEEN: Let's see, first thing, there are clearly transmissions losses. That's really why for long distance one steps up the voltage tremendously to move large amounts of power. I really am not very well steeped in transmission distribution, but if one looks at the grid, there really is a large mixture of base load, large capacity generating plants near large load centers. Smaller generators. . . FLATOW: But the point she's making, you don't know whether they're going to be putting the nuclear plants in her backyard or some other, where it's going to be used. Mr. MODEEN: No, and I think one of the things, from the point of emergency planning and otherwise, and of course, having it too close to a large metropolitan center just compounds emergency protection measures that want planning, that one has to take, so you just as well minimize that activity as far as complicate it. FLATOW: Arjun? Mr. MAKHIJANI: I can give you the number for transmission distribution losses. In this country it averages at about eight percent. And Dave is right, if you do step up the voltage, you can minimize those losses. And we have some distribution losses in city's that's part of that eight percent that are kind of unavoidable. The way transmission and distribution losses should be reduced, where nuclear power really has no role, is what electrical engineers call distributed grids, where you mix local co-generation, local generation of power in large buildings, co-generation of power and heat, much more efficient than most kinds of power plants, whether nuclear or coal. And you connect that with the grid, and you get a significant reduction mostly in distribution losses. So you do get very big gains. In regard to what is happening with routine pollution, I think, you know, this idea about safety, that there's no routine pollution, and so on, I think the caller is right, but I wouldn't point in the direction of the steam emissions, I don't they're a significant part of global warming. I think a lot of the problems actually being played out in the state with the most nuclear power plants in the country, in Illinois currently, they're Excelon, one of the largest nuclear operators in the country, is embroiled in a scandal around leaks of tritium. This is radioactive hydrogen that becomes combined with oxygen, makes radioactive water, and radioactive water crosses the placenta, affects pregnant women, you know, it's regulated. It can increase cancer risks, and genetic defect risks, and so on. And Excelon is embroiled in a huge controversy because its emissions and discharges of tritium, first of all, have been going on undetected for some time. It's been discharging tritium into drinking water, within drinking water standards, but no amount of radiation is safe, and communities are very upset to know that they have radioactive drinking water. FLATOW: All right, Brenda, thanks for calling. BRENDA: The only thing I have other, the only other thing I'd like to say is our plants are on Lake Ontario, so in order for it to get to a level where its going to be detectable by, you know, for them actually to be looking for it, you could be harming an incredible number of people. Because more and more municipalities are pulling their drinking water from Lake Ontario, is another thing. Mr. MODEEN: Yeah, I think the point, from what Dr. Makhijani was just mentioning is that, and we are the industry and I'm not here speaking for Excelon specifically, but there have been a number of these items identified here recently. And even today, last week, etc. , we're re-looking at the environmental monitoring, plans, procedures around our plants. Usually the activity has been that the, you know, if you can sample and determine what is on-site, what is on wells near the location of the plant, etc. , and that's okay, then you know you're not letting something go further abroad. And there are routine checks for that. FLATOW: Dave, tell us about this fourth generation of pressurized water reactors, something called a gas pebble head, gas pebble bed reactor that's being developed. Mr. MODEEN: Yes, there's a couple variations. Essentially what this is, is a reactor that, the objective is to do two things, one, have a smaller footprint, smaller size service, smaller market, really, so the capital costs are less, perhaps. Like South Africa, for instance, has been pursuing this. And the second part is that it uses materials, a different type of reactor physics approach toward the core, such that one gets higher temperatures and not only can it serve a role for electric generation, but the emission of hydrogen generation, you know, that's something that the president talked quite a bit about a couple years ago. And the thought was that if one can use hydrogen to replace, say, gasoline in the transportation infrastructure. Where do you get hydrogen today? We mostly get it from burning fossil fuels. That's really not a great substitute since we're trying to avoid burning fossil fuels in cars and busses and things like that. Mr. MAKHIJANI: The gen-four reactors I read that are in the president's programs are not the pebble-bed, by the way. They want to do away with the secondary containment that protected us all from the pebble-bed reactors, because they're going to be modular. They're just a 100 megawatts, much smaller than the reactors that we have. Mr. MODEEN: Well it's really because of the fuel performance. Mr. MAKHIJANI: Yeah, and, but you're doing away with essentially what has served as the foundation of the safety margin in the reactors that we have, in my opinion. And most of the severe accidents that have happened so far, we should note, have happened in graphite moderated reactors. Reactors that can catch fire, because they've got carbon, Chernobyl, Winscale, and so on. And pebble-bed is a graphite moderated reactor. Mr. MODEEN: And so far no one's looking at a pebble-bed in the U. S. Mr. MAKHIJANI: Yes. And so the gen-four reactors are, that are in the president's program, appear to be the sodium cooled fast reactors. These are reactors that use plutonium or trans-irenics as fuel, and they would be joined with these reprocessing plutonium separation technologies, supposedly to solve the waste problem. I really have bad news for the nuclear industry, because it isn't going to solve the waste problem. The kind of costs it is going to impose in the nuclear industry are going to be more than what the French are paying, which is 2 cents a kilowatt hour for plutonium fuel. Breeder reactors, fast-reactors, and plutonium fuel cycles, the world has spent so far, by my calculation, a hundred billion, with a B, dollars so far trying to commercialize this, and failed. And I don't believe this is going to solve the waste problem. Plus, we have lots of low-level waste. The French are discharging liquid wastes into the English Channel and polluting the oceans all the way to the Artic. And don't listen to me, ask the Norwegians, ask the Danes, ask the Germans. All those governments are so upset that they've asked the French to stop, and the French refused. FLATOW: We're talking about nuclear power this hour on TALK OF THE NATION SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. We're talking with Dave Modeen and Arjun Makhijani. Go ahead Dave. Mr. MODEEN: Yeah, Ira. I just wanted to be clear on what the industry priorities are as opposed to the government priorities, you know. FLATOW: Well, what about the pollution he was talking about and the waste disposal problem. Do you dispute those figures he was giving us? Mr. MODEEN: I think the figures he provided were relative, trying to develop a liquid metal reactor program. And what I wanted to say is that if one needs to go there, and this is more a government policy issue, in our view, you're 30, 40, 50 years away from that. This isn't something the electric industry is looking for. FLATOW: But so far we haven't got a disposal spot. You'll have these open, almost open pits of waste sitting there, around the country. Mr. MODEEN: Yes, I think, from all the scientific work that's been done on Yucca Mountain, the thousands of scientists, the six billion dollars spent, the decisions made and reinforced by the Congress and the president, we do have a repository that is acceptable. It's politically difficult, we're still working through that, but technically, and I think Dr. Makhijani, in the past, from reading his website, has certainly agreed that spent fuel pools are acceptable for the interim. Better yet, dry cast storage. Certainly the industry priority is to have D. O. E. live up to its, oh, I'm sorry, Department of Energy, and the government live up to its obligations and centralize in some interim storage facilities, these dry casts. But ultimately, a geologic repository, whether or not the long-term renaissance really plays out will be necessary. And we believe, and EPRI has done some studies, we believe Yucca Mountain is an acceptable location. Mr. MAKHIJANI: You know, I have some points of agreement with the industry, it's true. I don't think they ought to wait for some nuclear Leonardo da Vinci to save them, and I think they should actually distance themselves from this program. Yucca Mountain is the, and I say this as a supporter of a geologic repository program, as Dave knows, Yucca Mountain is the worst single site that has been researched in this country. That's why it is un-licensable, and Secretary Bogman has recently said there's no upper limit on costs and there's no upper limit on delays. So essentially, we don't have a repository program. We actually can create a repository program that's technically sensible, along the lines, say, that Sweden has got. And Sweden has had such a program for twenty years. It's going to take time, but going slowly will be faster and this is something the nuclear industry doesn't understand, I don't, you know, I don't want to give you friendly advice as to how to get a repository, but I think. . . FLATOW: Oh, come on. . . Mr. MAKHIJANI: . . . it'll be much faster if you abandon Yucca Mountain and advocate a repository program that is science-based and not politics-based, which is what we've got there. FLATOW: All right. Mr. MODEEN: Yeah, and I think we believe it is science-based, but. . . FLATOW: All right. They have a pointed disagreement, and its something I'm sure we'll be taking up down the line, because this is an area of disagreement that's not going to go away. I'd like to thank Dave Modeen, vice president of the nuclear division for the Electric Power Research Institute, or EPRI. He's based in Charlotte, North Carolina. Thank you Dave for joining us. Mr. MODEEN: Most welcome. FLATOW: You're welcome also. Arjun Makhijani is president of the Institute for Energy and Environmental Research in Tacoma Park, Maryland. Arjun, thank you for being with us today. Mr. MAKHIJANI: Thank you, Ira. FLATOW: You're welcome.  IRA FLATOW, host:  You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow. France gets about 75 percent of its electricity from nuclear power. Here in the U. S. that number is less than a third of that. France has brought 58 nuclear plants online in the last 30 years. The U. S. hasn't ordered any new plants here since the 1970s following the Three Mile Island accident.  But that may all be changing. President Bush has said that he wants to see an increased emphasis on nuclear power here in the U. S. including starting construction on new plants by the end of the decade. But is this country ready for nuclear power? Has the technology improved to the point where concerns over issues such as safety and waste disposal can be addressed? Where the phrase, Not in my back yard strikes fear in the heart of politicians is there a political will to build new plants?  On the other hand, ironically we are seeing environmentalists who once were rigidly opposed to nuclear power, some of them are now saying that compared to global warming, nuclear energy poses a much less threat. It's really the lesser of two evils. Will all of this be enough to reinvigorate the call to go nuclear?  What do you think? We'll be debating our nuclear energy proposal this hour. Do you think we should be revising nuclear energy in the United States? What do you think about it? Our number is 1-800-989-8255, 1-800-989-TALK. Let me introduce my guests. David Modeen is the vice president of the nuclear division for the Electric Power Research Institute or EPRI. He's based in Charlotte, North Carolina. He's joining us from our Washington studios. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY.  Mr. DAVID MODEEN (Vice President, Nuclear Division, Electric Power Research Institute, EPRI): Thank you, Ira.  FLATOW: Arjun Makhijani is the president of the Institute for the Energy and Environmental Research in Takoma Park, Maryland. Welcome back to the program.  Mr. ARJUN MAKHIJANI (President, Institute for Energy and Environmental Research, IEER): Thank you, Ira.  FLATOW: Let's talk, gentlemen, about this. It appears inevitable, does it not, that the government is going ahead, Dave, with the press toward more nuclear power.  Mr. MODEEN: Yes, I think very much so and there's a number of reasons. And I think at least trying to address greenhouse gas emissions is only one of many factors that really led, I think to the Bush Administration to come out so strongly in favor of nuclear energy.  FLATOW: In fact I'm reading from an article in Physics Today where it talks about the U. S. Congress's 2005 energy bill has tax credits worth $3. 1 billion in it. It gives something important, which is liability protection, which the nuclear industry lost following Three Mile Island. One of the things they couldn't get was insurance following that, correct?  Mr. MODEEN: No, I don't believe that is correct. There's been an act, in fact, the industry is self-insuring in the structure that the government puts in place that really has a model. It's essentially a no fault insurance to handle costs from such accidents, and that's been in place for the history of the commercial program.  FLATOW: So, why haven't there been new nuclear power plants?  Mr. MODEEN: I think, quite frankly, until the beginning of the 90s, we did not operate the plants as well as we do today. We've had a steady increase in the efficiency and the effectiveness today where the fleet-wide average is 90 percent efficiency. It's the lowest cost-based generation by all metrics both industry and government it's as safe or safer today than it's ever been.  FLATOW: Arjun, your reaction.  Mr. MAKHIJANI: Yes, well, first of all, I'm very glad that this sudden soft corner that we should do something about global warming. Because I agree that it's a gigantic and perhaps the most important environmental problem humanity has ever faced. In order to address it to the level of France, we need about 700 or 800 nuclear power plants here in the next 50, if you want 75 to 80 percent in this country. It's much bigger than France with a much bigger electricity sector. That's about maybe two a month, or three every two months, for the next 40 years. Not an achievable level.  In regard to the energy bill, it's very interesting that the nuclear power industry, after half a century of government support, still wants subsidies. Wall Street has no confidence in nuclear power, and although a lot of people are talking about it, nobody's really ordered a reactor yet. And I hope the government doesn't get into the business.  They keep saying it's very economical, and the way, we talked about this last time, the way the numbers are put on the table as a capital cost is not included and they say $. 02 a kilowatt hour but Wall Street doesn't agree with that if you include the capital cost, which is most of the cost, then of course government subsidies still appear to be necessary half a century after the start of nuclear power. Otherwise they'd go and order them. Wall Street would be waiting for the ten to twelve percent return on investment that electric power plants are supposed to give.  FLATOW: According to this Physics Today article, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission certified the design of a new reactor, a Westinghouse reactor, last December, and they think that order may be forthcoming within the next two years.  Mr. MAKHIJANI: Yeah, I think that orders may be forthcoming, the first six. The extent of government subsidies per reactor may be $1 to $2 billion a year. A couple of years ago the Congressional Budget Office estimated that there would be a high likelihood of loan defaults. So, you know, if the government guarantees loans and puts up maybe $5, $10, $12 billion for the first six plants, we'll have six plants. But how far is that going to take us? Our growth in electricity requires 20, 30 plants every year, and we have six plants in ten years, it's really a few drops in the bucket.  FLATOW: So, you are arguing that there are not enough plants being ordered?  Mr. MAKHIJANI: Well, no, I'm not agreeing, I'm saying that nobody's lining up to really build a lot of nuclear power plants. And to say that nuclear power plants are going to be the answer to the electricity sector's woes and to global warming is, so far at least, in fantasy land.  Mr. MODEEN: Ira, if I could?  FLATOW: David, yeah.  Mr. MODEEN: If I could offer a couple perspectives. First of all, I think it's important for me to note that at EPRI, we advocated a diverse generation portfolio, and nuclear is going to play a key role, but we're also looking very hard and with our member organizations at clean coal, in addition to natural gas, renewables, wind, bio-mass, solar.  And strategically for almost any business in the U. S. today, a utility business, you really do need a mix. And so, we don't, I think the view of my members, is that maintaining that 20 percent as our demand for electric energy continues to increase, is very important, and nibbling away, may be increasing a bit. But we're not trying to follow a market penetration like what is in France.  FLATOW: But Dave you have two big issues that are still outstanding in the eyes of the public. One is, we don't have a place to put the waste. The Yucca Mountain has not been approved and we don't know where to put the stuff now. And number two, people still have this not in my back yard syndrome. They still don't trust the technology to be safe here as they might in other countries.  Mr. MODEEN: Actually, I think as the industry gets its message out, and I've seen this in the last five, six, seven years, and I think that's why there's really this push toward nuclear energy today, is there is a recognition that one, on the safety issue it's a very vast improvement from decades before. And most individuals, and the polls bear this out, are comfortable with nuclear energy.  Now on the second piece, yes Yucca Mountain has been a protracted exercise. A very complicated exercise and yet ultimately there needs to be a centralized repository, someplace where the residual used fuel or waste products from that. There has been the debate most recently about if one has a strong growth in the nuclear energy field, what is the role of Yucca Mountain? And in fact, the Bush Administration has new proposals that were just announced in the last, oh, couple weeks that align very well with our longer term vision of what's the appropriate way to handle or dispose this used fuel from the reactors.  FLATOW: Arjun?  Mr. MAKHIJANI: Yes, actually, I think so far as global warming and any good things that might come of, nuclear energy doesn't emit significant carbon dioxide emissions. So, I think we have a point of agreement there and we should debate this seriously. But the Bush global nuclear energy program is really puts nuclear energy in a much more slippery slope, much more proliferation prone.  It creates a kind of a nuclear apartheid in the world. It talks about fuel cycle countries, in a very polite way, nuclear fuel cycle countries where plutonium, which can be trusted with plutonium, and then other countries which are reactor countries. Well, this is like a unilateral amendment of the nonproliferation treaty, which guarantees its parties that they have the \"inalienable right\" to nuclear power. And it isn't going to go down. If you promote the separation of plutonium, and promote nuclear energy, you're going to wind up with uranium enrichment and reprocessing technologies throughout the world. Not I think a very pleasant future to look at.  So while we can talk about nuclear power and global warming in the present scheme of things like water reactors, I'm not a fan as you know. But I think this global nuclear energy program of reprocessing plutonium separation, being promoted as proliferation-resistant, when you can make bombs out of the stuff. This is really not a sensible program and many advocates of nuclear energy, I think, are quite skeptical. They're going along because the president is talking about nuclear energy every day.  Mr. MODEEN: If I could offer a couple. . .  IRA FLATOW: Dave, sure.  Mr. MODEEN: Yeah, observations. First of all, I need to be careful that I don't speak for the federal government nor policy for the industry. What I thought was interesting about the global nuclear energy partnership is that EPRI does have a science section amongst our four divisions, and we really pride ourselves in trying to understand the issues to inform the policy debate, and although we would not necessarily sequence things in the order that is promoted in the global nuclear energy partnership, the types of research and development needed, and the types of programs developed to address the very issues of nonproliferation that Dr. Makhijani was referring to, are, you know, very much need to be done before one really signs up for the type of regime I think that is outlined in the G. N. E. P.  FLATOW: Can you be more specific. I don't find one fact in that. . .  Mr. MODEEN: No, no actually the fact is, that the advance, not the current type of reprocessing that occurs in France or has occurred in the United Kingdom in the past, but in fact, an advanced technology, and what's referred to as an advanced fuel cycle initiative, such that one doesn't result in separation streams of pure plutonium, the real concern of what might be available to a terrorist organization. Otherwise, you mix that, those reprocessing byproducts in such a way that there's no advantage to one that wants to use the isotopes in an inappropriate manner.  Dr. MAKHIJANI: You know, terrorists won't care if they're impure plutonium, so long as you can make a chain reaction out of it. Weapon states like the United States, or Russian, or Britain, or China, won't want impure plutonium. They can't make bombs with predictable yields, controlled, you know, the kind of strategies that weaponeers designed when they do their war planning.  But I don't terrorists or non-nuclear states do the same kind of war planning. They're into, will it explode? And they don't care if it's one kiloton or ten kilotons. A nuclear fuel, a nuclear fizzle, is several hundred tons of TNT equivalent. And I think for a terrorist fizzle, it would have a huge effect, and proliferating these technologies is not. . .  Let's look at France, the sort of model country for plutonium separation. Three quick points. They spend about two cents a kilowatt hour extra for every kilowatt hour they generate from plutonium fuel. This is calculated from their government study with the participation of their atomic energy commission. They reprocess for foreigners, which is something in the new program proposed by President Bush. Well, they reprocess for France, uh, for Japan. Japan has separated plutonium in the commercial sector. And in 2002, Ishiro Osawa (ph), their labor party head said, if China gets something, there's a close quote, not an exact quote, paraphrase, if China gets too uppity, Japan should make thousands of nuclear weapons from its commercial sector plutonium.  Now, that's the real world that we are in, once we start separating plutonium. Commercial plutonium was set by Japan to be not suitable for nuclear weapons only 10 years ago, but suddenly they're saying they could make thousands of weapons out of it.  FLATOW: We're talking about nuclear power this hour on TALK OF THE NATION SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. Talking with Dave Modeen of EPRI and Arjun Makhijani, who is president of the Institute for Energy and Environmental Research in Tacoma Park. Our number 1800-989-8255. Dave, you wanted to jump in there. . .  Mr. MODEEN: Yeah, I wanted to maybe, maybe refocus the discussion a little bit. Because I've had, there are clearly some policy issues, and governmental issues relative to nonproliferation, but I think the point before the country now is that for the first time in a while, we need new base-load generation, about ten years out. We're looking at lots of different options for that. Nuclear happens to be one of them, because of the demonstrated performance of the current plants, and much of the improvements over, and I can enumerate them, but I won't right now, in the last 15, 20 years.  And then also the opportunity with these new designs, where we've applied the lessons learned from the past, because we really did ramp up as an industry quite quickly in the '60s and '70s, and it was not a mature technology at that time. And there's any number of things that EPRI involved with the vendors and the utilities, such that the AP 1000 Westinghouse Reactor that you had just mentioned, is even better than what we currently have operating, although we're quite comfortable with the safety record and continued performance of the current plants.  FLATOW: What makes these new designs safer than the old. . . ?  Mr. MODEEN: Several things. One through operating experience, we've learned in materials performance. For example, materials not to use, heat treatments not to have, chemistry programs not to use, and, again, chemistry programs to use. Maintenance techniques in the accessibility and lay-down areas, such that, you know, we spend a lot of money on operations and maintenance activities at the plant to keep them running almost 24/7 for a year and half, two years in a row. The designs are much more forgiving from, from an accident point of view. And by forgiving I mean they can accommodate a loss of electricity, loss of fluids, because power densities are less, margins are increased, cooling volumes are increased, less number of active components. It's just a large, large number of things. That all, all through the, you know, the trial and error, and kind of fits and starts, especially in the early years of the industry, that we realize we sure don't want to do that again, what's something we can do better?  Dr. MAKHIJANI: Ira let me say. . .  FLATOW: All right, yeah, I got a minute before the break. Go ahead.  Dr. MAKHIJANI: Let me say a couple things about safety. The reason that the industry can claim it is safer, you know, you have to go in and actually discover the small problems before the big problems. I think in the last 10 years we've been asking for trouble. The industry isn't necessarily safer. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has a smaller technical staff, and it is allowing self-inspection and self-regulation, and there have been many problems where we've been very, very close. The Davis Bessie Reactor had a corrosion eat much of the way through the head of the reactor vessel. We were not far from a very, very serious accident. And it turns out, the French had warned the Americans about this problem. There were corrosion problems at a number of plants that were similar, from boric acid. And the Nuclear Regulatory Commission simply wasn't paying attention. What we've got is a situation is where the NRC is much more lax than in the '80s.  FLATOW: Alright. Barry, we're going to have to take a break and we'll come back and pick up with the debate over nuclear power. With Dave Modeen and Arjun Makhijani and your questions. Stay with us. We'll be right back. I'm Ira Flatow. This TALK OF THE NATION SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.  (Soundbite of music)  FLATOW: You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow. We're talking this hour about nuclear energy with my guests. David Modeen is vice president of the nuclear division for the Electric Power Research Institute, or EPRI. Arjun Makhijani is the president of the Institute for Energy and Environmental Research in Tacoma Park, Maryland. Our number 1800-989-8255. Lots of people with questions. David in Lake Oswego, Oregon. Hi welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY.  DAVID (Caller): Well, thank you. I've always wondered or maybe it would help people feel a little more safe about nuclear power if they went with sort of a standardized plant instead of each of these one-off plants. Something along the lines of the nuclear facilities they have aboard ships, and that kind of thing. Where, if they had a problem in one, it would instantly tell them hey we've got to check all the other plants to see if the same thing is happening. Somewhat like what they do in jet engines and that kind of thing.  FLATOW: That's a good question. I've heard that for years about, and I think people had referred to the success of European, I think France has one, one or two designs for many, many of their plants. Why not go Dave with one design and then be able to sort of know when something's going wrong, maybe to fix the other plants, or to have enough hours of experience with all these plants together when something might go bad?  Mr. MODEEN: Yeah, that's actually a very good thought, and it's one that the industry has pursued. In fact in the late '80s and early '90s, EPRI managed an advanced reactor corporation. And the purpose, I had mentioned all these lessons learned from experiences, we defined with our utility advisors and vendors, a utility requirements document, which was essentially a utility specification of what they wanted to see in a new design, with the idea of a standardizing, a lot of focus, in fact the French, the Electricity de France was part of that program. And then from there the vendors have proposed the standardized designs.  That AP 1000 is one of those offered by Westinghouse. General Electric has a certified design they built in Asia, they haven't built here, called the Advance Blowing Water Reactor. GE is looking to certify another BWR, a little bit different but again, standardized designs. And then. . .  FLATOW: But they're different designs. One company versus another company.  Mr. MODEEN: Well, the key difference actually is it's one or two or three, so you have market competition in the U. S. , and trying to extract the best economic price one can get.  FLATOW: But sometimes it's just one little component, like in Three Mile Island, just a valve or something that you know could be one of thousands of components, but it's not part of the same design.  Mr. MODEEN: Let's see. . .  Dr. MAKHIJANI: Could I jump in?  FLATOW: Yeah, go ahead.  Dr. MAKHIJANI: There are some advantages to having common designs, and you're right. The French actually have three different sizes of reactors. And they, the advantages, there are some disadvantages to common designs, and the French have experienced that also. They, when they discovered this problem of boric acid corrosion, they realized they had to, they had the same design, they had to go back and replace all the reactor heads. And they knew they had a serious safety issue, but they couldn't do it all at once because 75 percent of their electricity come from nuclear. And so if you have the kind of valve that you were talking about that may stick, but you haven't discovered it yet, this is a difficult problem with nuclear. And then changing the design? The AP 1000 does have more important safety features, where there have been lessons learned, I think, in the nuclear industry.  However, when you're going to digital design, when you're going to new features, nuclear reactor is not like a car or a jet engine. You can take a jet engine or car and drive it 100,000 miles, or run it for a great number of hours, at full power or over the rated power, and test it to failure, and then put it on real commercial. You can't do that with nuclear energy. That's a problem.  Mr. MODEEN: Well, actually we've done that in a lot of integrated test defects, prototypical defects. I think something that the audience needs to keep in mind is that it's a whole team effort in operating a plant. It's not, you know, the men and women that design and maintain and operate these facilities are very dedicated. We do have issues, just like any other large manufacturer or industrial facility. You need to be striving for excellence. I think we have not been satisfied with the status quo. Things will, you need to learn from those lessons and move on, but I think the industry's safety record really speaks for itself.  Even Three Mile Island, as much as, I don't like going back there, there were any number of mistakes done there, and yet from the defense in-depth of that plant, I mean it was very much an economic disaster for the company, but in the long run, it was not an impact to society.  FLATOW: Let's go to the phones. Let's go to Brenda, in New Haven. Hi Brenda.  BRENDA (Caller): Hi, Ira. Thanks for taking my call. I have a couple of questions. First of all, if they do go ahead and build these, I personally would like to see them put closer to the end-use point because, I live in Oswego County. We have three nuke plants. All of our power goes into the northeast grid, none of it is used here. And I've been told by people that work for National Grid that as much as 40 to 50 percent of the power is lost in transmission. Now to me, that's doubling how much electricity we actually have to generate, because we're not putting it where the people are using it.  The other thing is, I mean, there's a big plume of, you know, water vapor going up into the air, day after day after day. I know it's not talked about, but I remember when I was learning about global warming, water vapor was considered a greenhouse gas. And what about all that heat that's being added to the atmosphere, how is that not having an impact on global warming?  FLATOW: Dave Modeen?  Mr. MODEEN: Let's see, first thing, there are clearly transmissions losses. That's really why for long distance one steps up the voltage tremendously to move large amounts of power. I really am not very well steeped in transmission distribution, but if one looks at the grid, there really is a large mixture of base load, large capacity generating plants near large load centers. Smaller generators. . .  FLATOW: But the point she's making, you don't know whether they're going to be putting the nuclear plants in her backyard or some other, where it's going to be used.  Mr. MODEEN: No, and I think one of the things, from the point of emergency planning and otherwise, and of course, having it too close to a large metropolitan center just compounds emergency protection measures that want planning, that one has to take, so you just as well minimize that activity as far as complicate it.  FLATOW: Arjun?  Mr. MAKHIJANI: I can give you the number for transmission distribution losses. In this country it averages at about eight percent. And Dave is right, if you do step up the voltage, you can minimize those losses. And we have some distribution losses in city's that's part of that eight percent that are kind of unavoidable.  The way transmission and distribution losses should be reduced, where nuclear power really has no role, is what electrical engineers call distributed grids, where you mix local co-generation, local generation of power in large buildings, co-generation of power and heat, much more efficient than most kinds of power plants, whether nuclear or coal. And you connect that with the grid, and you get a significant reduction mostly in distribution losses. So you do get very big gains.  In regard to what is happening with routine pollution, I think, you know, this idea about safety, that there's no routine pollution, and so on, I think the caller is right, but I wouldn't point in the direction of the steam emissions, I don't they're a significant part of global warming.  I think a lot of the problems actually being played out in the state with the most nuclear power plants in the country, in Illinois currently, they're Excelon, one of the largest nuclear operators in the country, is embroiled in a scandal around leaks of tritium. This is radioactive hydrogen that becomes combined with oxygen, makes radioactive water, and radioactive water crosses the placenta, affects pregnant women, you know, it's regulated. It can increase cancer risks, and genetic defect risks, and so on. And Excelon is embroiled in a huge controversy because its emissions and discharges of tritium, first of all, have been going on undetected for some time. It's been discharging tritium into drinking water, within drinking water standards, but no amount of radiation is safe, and communities are very upset to know that they have radioactive drinking water.  FLATOW: All right, Brenda, thanks for calling.  BRENDA: The only thing I have other, the only other thing I'd like to say is our plants are on Lake Ontario, so in order for it to get to a level where its going to be detectable by, you know, for them actually to be looking for it, you could be harming an incredible number of people. Because more and more municipalities are pulling their drinking water from Lake Ontario, is another thing.  Mr. MODEEN: Yeah, I think the point, from what Dr. Makhijani was just mentioning is that, and we are the industry and I'm not here speaking for Excelon specifically, but there have been a number of these items identified here recently. And even today, last week, etc. , we're re-looking at the environmental monitoring, plans, procedures around our plants. Usually the activity has been that the, you know, if you can sample and determine what is on-site, what is on wells near the location of the plant, etc. , and that's okay, then you know you're not letting something go further abroad. And there are routine checks for that.  FLATOW: Dave, tell us about this fourth generation of pressurized water reactors, something called a gas pebble head, gas pebble bed reactor that's being developed.  Mr. MODEEN: Yes, there's a couple variations. Essentially what this is, is a reactor that, the objective is to do two things, one, have a smaller footprint, smaller size service, smaller market, really, so the capital costs are less, perhaps. Like South Africa, for instance, has been pursuing this. And the second part is that it uses materials, a different type of reactor physics approach toward the core, such that one gets higher temperatures and not only can it serve a role for electric generation, but the emission of hydrogen generation, you know, that's something that the president talked quite a bit about a couple years ago. And the thought was that if one can use hydrogen to replace, say, gasoline in the transportation infrastructure. Where do you get hydrogen today? We mostly get it from burning fossil fuels. That's really not a great substitute since we're trying to avoid burning fossil fuels in cars and busses and things like that.  Mr. MAKHIJANI: The gen-four reactors I read that are in the president's programs are not the pebble-bed, by the way. They want to do away with the secondary containment that protected us all from the pebble-bed reactors, because they're going to be modular. They're just a 100 megawatts, much smaller than the reactors that we have.  Mr. MODEEN: Well it's really because of the fuel performance.  Mr. MAKHIJANI: Yeah, and, but you're doing away with essentially what has served as the foundation of the safety margin in the reactors that we have, in my opinion. And most of the severe accidents that have happened so far, we should note, have happened in graphite moderated reactors. Reactors that can catch fire, because they've got carbon, Chernobyl, Winscale, and so on. And pebble-bed is a graphite moderated reactor.  Mr. MODEEN: And so far no one's looking at a pebble-bed in the U. S.  Mr. MAKHIJANI: Yes. And so the gen-four reactors are, that are in the president's program, appear to be the sodium cooled fast reactors. These are reactors that use plutonium or trans-irenics as fuel, and they would be joined with these reprocessing plutonium separation technologies, supposedly to solve the waste problem.  I really have bad news for the nuclear industry, because it isn't going to solve the waste problem. The kind of costs it is going to impose in the nuclear industry are going to be more than what the French are paying, which is 2 cents a kilowatt hour for plutonium fuel. Breeder reactors, fast-reactors, and plutonium fuel cycles, the world has spent so far, by my calculation, a hundred billion, with a B, dollars so far trying to commercialize this, and failed. And I don't believe this is going to solve the waste problem.  Plus, we have lots of low-level waste. The French are discharging liquid wastes into the English Channel and polluting the oceans all the way to the Artic. And don't listen to me, ask the Norwegians, ask the Danes, ask the Germans. All those governments are so upset that they've asked the French to stop, and the French refused.  FLATOW: We're talking about nuclear power this hour on TALK OF THE NATION SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. We're talking with Dave Modeen and Arjun Makhijani. Go ahead Dave.  Mr. MODEEN: Yeah, Ira. I just wanted to be clear on what the industry priorities are as opposed to the government priorities, you know.  FLATOW: Well, what about the pollution he was talking about and the waste disposal problem. Do you dispute those figures he was giving us?  Mr. MODEEN: I think the figures he provided were relative, trying to develop a liquid metal reactor program. And what I wanted to say is that if one needs to go there, and this is more a government policy issue, in our view, you're 30, 40, 50 years away from that. This isn't something the electric industry is looking for.  FLATOW: But so far we haven't got a disposal spot. You'll have these open, almost open pits of waste sitting there, around the country.  Mr. MODEEN: Yes, I think, from all the scientific work that's been done on Yucca Mountain, the thousands of scientists, the six billion dollars spent, the decisions made and reinforced by the Congress and the president, we do have a repository that is acceptable. It's politically difficult, we're still working through that, but technically, and I think Dr. Makhijani, in the past, from reading his website, has certainly agreed that spent fuel pools are acceptable for the interim. Better yet, dry cast storage.  Certainly the industry priority is to have D. O. E. live up to its, oh, I'm sorry, Department of Energy, and the government live up to its obligations and centralize in some interim storage facilities, these dry casts. But ultimately, a geologic repository, whether or not the long-term renaissance really plays out will be necessary. And we believe, and EPRI has done some studies, we believe Yucca Mountain is an acceptable location.  Mr. MAKHIJANI: You know, I have some points of agreement with the industry, it's true. I don't think they ought to wait for some nuclear Leonardo da Vinci to save them, and I think they should actually distance themselves from this program. Yucca Mountain is the, and I say this as a supporter of a geologic repository program, as Dave knows, Yucca Mountain is the worst single site that has been researched in this country. That's why it is un-licensable, and Secretary Bogman has recently said there's no upper limit on costs and there's no upper limit on delays. So essentially, we don't have a repository program.  We actually can create a repository program that's technically sensible, along the lines, say, that Sweden has got. And Sweden has had such a program for twenty years. It's going to take time, but going slowly will be faster and this is something the nuclear industry doesn't understand, I don't, you know, I don't want to give you friendly advice as to how to get a repository, but I think. . .  FLATOW: Oh, come on. . .  Mr. MAKHIJANI: . . . it'll be much faster if you abandon Yucca Mountain and advocate a repository program that is science-based and not politics-based, which is what we've got there.  FLATOW: All right.  Mr. MODEEN: Yeah, and I think we believe it is science-based, but. . .  FLATOW: All right. They have a pointed disagreement, and its something I'm sure we'll be taking up down the line, because this is an area of disagreement that's not going to go away. I'd like to thank Dave Modeen, vice president of the nuclear division for the Electric Power Research Institute, or EPRI. He's based in Charlotte, North Carolina. Thank you Dave for joining us.  Mr. MODEEN: Most welcome.  FLATOW: You're welcome also. Arjun Makhijani is president of the Institute for Energy and Environmental Research in Tacoma Park, Maryland. Arjun, thank you for being with us today.  Mr. MAKHIJANI: Thank you, Ira.  FLATOW: You're welcome. ", "section": "Science", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2006 NPR.  All rights reserved.

I'm Ira Flatow. In his state of the union speech, President Bush introduced a plan to increase spending on science and technology. President GEORGE W. BUSH: Tonight I announce an American Competitiveness Initiative to encourage innovation throughout our economy and to give our nation's children a firm grounding in math and science. (Soundbite of applause) FLATOW: This house, does America need a new initiative for science? And will the president's plan get the job done? And since it's National Engineering Week, we'll talk about plans to get more girls interested in engineering. Plus, does climate have the power to change civilizations, and if so, what might it do to ours and how quickly? It's all coming up after this break. Stay with us. (Soundbite of music) FLATOW: You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow. In his State of the Union address, President Bush announced his new American Competitiveness Initiative. Well, that's a plan to commit more than $136 billion over ten years to, quote, \"increase investments in research and development, strengthening education, and encourage entrepreneurship and innovation. \" The president's announcement came on the heels of a report issued in January by the National Academies. That report is called Rising Above the Gathering Storm, and it warned that, quote, \"the scientific and technological building blocks critical to our economic leadership are eroding. \" Here are just a few of the many points that are made in the report. China and India are far outpacing the U. S. in awarding of college degrees in engineering, computer science, and information technology. U. S. 12th graders performed below the international average on a test of general knowledge in science and math. And in the U. S. , science and technology workforce in the year 2000, 38 percent of the Ph. D. s were foreign-born. Just a few of the indicators of the status of science and technology included in the report. So, what can be done to reverse the trend? That's what we'll be talking about this hour. Is the president's new initiative enough? Is it not enough? What more needs to be done? I'm gonna be joined this hour by three engineers, because after all, it is National Engineer's Week. And we'll also take a look at how engineers are working to get girls interested in engineering.

Ralph Wyndrum, Jr. is the president of the IEEE-USA. He's an electrical and computer engineer. He worked at Bell Labs in New Jersey for more than 30 years. He joins me here in our New York studios. Thank you for coming in today, Dr. Wyndrum. Dr. RALPH WYNDRUM, JR. (President, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers): Thank you very much for having us. FLATOW: You're welcome. Patricia Welesko Garland is the chair of Engineers Week 2006. She is a chemical engineer, program manager of the Combined Heat and Power Program at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and a former Girl Scout troop leader. She joins us from our NPR studios in Washington. Thank you for talking with us today, doctor, uh, Ms. Garland. MS. PATRICIA WELESKO GARLAND (Chair, Engineers Week 2006): Thank you, Mr. Flatow. FLATOW: You're welcome. Dan Mote, Jr. , is the president of the University of Maryland. He is also a mechanical engineer, a member of the National Academy of Engineering, he served as a member of the National Academy's Committee on Prospering in the Global Economy of the 21st Century, and the findings of that committee, I read a little bit from it, are found in the report I mentioned, Rising Above the Gathering Storm, Energizing and Employing America for a Brighter Economic Future. He's also in our Washington studios. Thank you for being with us today, Dr. Mote. Dr. C. D. MOTE, JR. (President, University of Maryland): Thank you, Ira, very much. Please to be here. FLATOW: I want to just begin with you from the first paragraph of your findings. You say that we fear the abruptness in which a lead in science and technology can be lost and the difficulty of recovering a lead once lost, if it indeed it can be regained at all. Do you fear we have permanently lost our leadership in science and technology? Dr. MOTE: No, no, clearly. I don't think anybody on this task force, this committee that wrote this report, believes we've lost our leadership in science and technology. I think the concern is that the building blocks for the leadership of the future is what is eroding. In fact, our leadership in science and technology, we must understand, was created decades ago. Our processes and our enterprises of 20 and 30 years ago have led to our leadership today. The question is what will our leadership be 20 years from now, and that is what this report is really about. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Do you think the president's American Competitive Initiative addresses some of those issues that your report talks about? Dr. MOTE: It definitely does. In fact, I think most of us involved in this enterprise since it started, most recently last summer, believe that the president's state of the union address and the ACI come directly from the recommendations of this report and really is responsive to the issues that are brought forward. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Ralph Wyndrum, what are the problems facing engineering today? We keep hearing about there is a shortage of engineers. Is there a shortage of engineers? Dr. WYNDRUM: Well, yes, I think there is a shortage of engineers, and I think you have to look beyond the shortage, and you have to look at what has happened to engineering over the last five to 10 years. We've gone away from institutions, such as Bell Laboratories and IBM Research and a number of others, to institutions that are much more concerned with current product. If I take Bell Laboratories as an example, when it was operating at full thrust, it was the leading institution in the world of its kind. It had courses in innovation. It had in-hours courses. What is happening is, and we have found this out in a 2005 member survey, our engineers are becoming obsolete. Their ability to take courses is less and less, at this point, and our member survey showed that 37 percent of our membership, that's a quarter of a million American engineers, 30 percent of them were concerned and indicated that they needed to have an easy way to continue their education on their own, at this point. FLATOW: You talk about the quality of keeping present, keeping up-to-date with the engineers, but there also seem to be a pure number of engineers that there's a shortage. Let me just read from the National Academy's report. It says, one estimate is that in 2004, China graduated about 350,000 engineers, computer scientists, information technologists, with four-year degrees, while the U. S. graduated only 14,000. That's 350 versus, I'm sorry, 140,000. Dr. WYNDRUM: 140,000. FLATOW: That's still less than half. . . Dr. WYNDRUM: That's correct. FLATOW: . . . than what we have, generally. Dr. WYNDRUM: That's correct. Now, I've spent some time in China, and I have to tell you,t I've been to locations such as Chingwa(ph) University. A very large number, as I think other people are aware, of those engineers are in fact civil engineers. . . FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Dr. WYNDRUM: . . . concerned with the infrastructure of China, and so you have to compare the classes of engineering rather than just engineers as a group to understand where the shortages are. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Dr. WYNDRUM: But I think there is little doubt that with the continuing process of increasing engineering education in China, and the quality of engineering education in China, they are going to graduate, certainly, more engineers than we are for a long period of time. I think we need to be concerned, with the explosion of the information age, that we will not have the number of engineers we need for the information explosion, for the innovation that we need in the future. FLATOW: Patricia Garland, does that concern you, too? Ms. GARLAND: Absolutely. We need to change our message that we're taking out into colleges and universities to increase our numbers. While. . . FLATOW: How do you convince someone to become an engineer? And I know you're involved with women engineers. How do you convince a woman to say that you should be going into engineering? Ms. GARLAND: Well, you can't necessarily convince somebody. What you can do is you can provide them information about engineering that would motivate them to choose engineering. What we're seeing is that we can continue to do what we've been doing in the past, going into the classrooms and telling students that engineering is great for you if you love math and science and if you want a challenging career, but why then aren't the numbers changing? Women make up 46 percent of the workforce, but we've had pretty stable numbers over the last few years where we only make up 11 percent of the engineering work force. And as the number of jobs requiring engineering in this country are increasing, the number of students that are taking technical and engineering classes remain pretty stable. And of those numbers, women and minorities are still severely under-represented. Women make up 55 percent of all engineering undergraduate, women make up 55 percent of all the undergraduate students in this country. Yet we only are at 20 percent of the undergraduate engineering degrees. And although the numbers in high schools, women are taking equal amounts of classes, such as biology and math, as boys are, at equal numbers. Well, why is it that women aren't taking the same amount of engineering classes as boys? FLATOW: Why is that? Ms. GARLAND: Well. . . FLATOW: Where are they going? We know women are good in science and math. Ms. GARLAND: A lot of women tend to go into the medical profession or the legal profession. As part of an extraordinary women engineers project, which is a coalition of engineering societies which pull together to take a look at why is it that young women aren't going into engineering. They did a study with some focus groups and interviewed students to find out what motivates young girls to take engineering. And what we're learning is that we aren't providing them the message that they want. Women want to do work that they find exciting, work that they would find beneficial to society, they want to do work that pays well and offers them flexibility. And we tend to take into the classroom different messages. So as part of National Engineer's Week, the Society of Women Engineers in Northrop Grumman Corporation came up with a connecting educators to engineering program, which is fourfold. Working, taking engineers into the classroom to deliver a different message to the students, and also to work with educators to help them with the messaging that gets across to girls, to get girls excited about engineering, and boys as well. FLATOW: Well what are you bringing, who comes into the class to say, look I'm an engineer get excited about me? What kind of, how do you do that? Ms. GARLAND: Well, uh, somebody like myself. The engineering societies as well could offer to their, IEEE for example, would offer to their engineers to go into the classroom to meet with students. FLATOW: Hmm. Ms. GARLAND: And in the past, some of us have had some difficulties in trying to navigate through school systems, for example. How do you get with the teachers, how do you get into the classrooms? So part of the connecting program is web in our training that we're offering to engineers over the internet to learn about how to navigate the system, how to prepare the message, how to prepare the presentations, what type of information do girls and boys want to hear regarding engineering? FLATOW: All right we're going take a short break and come back and talk lots more about science and engineering, applied sciences, and this is National Engineering Week. Talk about what needs to be done so that we don't have, you know a shortage of engineers, a shortage of science students. There's a problem about immigration we'll get into, about visiting science professors, having trouble getting into the country. Just a story this week the President is going to India. India has blocked three scientists who would like to come into the country. We'll talk about that. So stay with us, we'll talk more and take your calls after this break, don't go away. (Soundbite of music) FLATOW: You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY, I'm Ira Flatow. We're talking this hour about science and technology investment in the United States. Our way of celebrating that National Engineers Week with my guests, Ralph Wyndrum, President of the IEEE U. S. A. , Patricia Welesko Garland, Co-Chair of Engineers Week 2006. She's also the manager of the Combined Heat and Power Program at Oak Ridge National Laboratory; and C. D. Mote Jr. , otherwise called Dan, is President of the University of Maryland. Our number 1-800-989-8255. Is there anything, let me ask, just throw this out, we always hear about the federal government taking an active role in, with students and teachers and things, yet very little of any school budget comes from the federal government, just a few percentage points. School is a local thing, it's by PTA's, committees, taxes, and superintendents, and boards of educations, and things like that. Can the federal government really do anything to influence the direction or is it really, Ralph, up to local people, you know, teachers and people like engineers going into classrooms and changing perceptions there? Dr. WYNDRUM: Well, there are several things the federal government can do. And if you look at the Protecting the Americas Competitive Edge Act, which is moving through the Senate right now, you will find that money is being set aside in grants to provide an extra year of education in math and science so that we get qualified and deeply trained people in mathematics. FLATOW: Teachers. Mr. WYNDRUM: Who are teachers. FLATOW: That's the real problem isn't it. Mr. WYNDRUM: Exactly. FLATOW: Yeah. Mr. WYNDRUM: I mean in the New York area we have a major shortage of teachers qualified to teach math and science. And the federal government can have a major impact at that level. FLATOW: Can it really, in the number of teachers it can put out there that . . . Mr. WYNDRUM: I believe, if it wants to, it could correct the problem. FLATOW: Mm hmmm. Mr. WYNDRUM: By providing this additional training and the other grants in those acts. The merit-based scholarships, the continuing education for teachers, that's an important input. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Dan, you say in your report. . . Mr. MOTE: I would say, Ira, the pace legislations, of which there are three, are basically a direct result of the report, Rising Above the Gathering Storm. And in fact the Senators, that would be Bingham and Alexander, Senator Mikulski and fourth one sorry I've forgotten. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Mr. MOTE: Who have proposed this legislation essentially took these initiatives out of that report. And clearly these, this report is for federal legislation which is to assist at local levels. But the point you're making is an extremely good one. There needs to be effort taken at the local level to follow up on this Rising Above the Gathering Storm at the state and local levels.  That is, the initiative at the federal level has really caught on like wildfire. There's not only the pace legislation but there's also legislation in the House, both bipartisan legislations. There's a lot interest in this. And in fact, the state of the union address and the ACI Initiative also has this in it from the president's point of view. He has about training teachers and getting professionals in to instruct in the schools. He has an idea that we should bring in 30,000 professionals to teach and essentially train 70,000 teachers who are actually qualified in science and technology as their field in order to teach. But the state and local level issue is still left hanging as you suggest. Each state, and in fact in regions in the state, they should take on the initiative themselves of looking for how the states will organize under the themes of this pace legislation or under this report, Rising Above the Gathering Storm. In the state of Maryland where we are, we actually have that planned already on the 26 of April. We're gathering all the state leadership under the four or maybe five major themes of this report to essentially see how we could organize the state to put it into kind of synchronization with the federal legislation. Those themes are the following ones. The K through 12 theme that we've been talking about is one of the very important one. How do we prepare teachers for qualifications to teach science and technology at an advance level and get that done? Second would be basic research, the fundamental building blocks of our technology in the future, especially in engineering or physical sciences, information sciences, and computer sciences. That's a big need as well. Thirdly is the best and the brightest issue of higher education and international students, and how we're going to essentially get the best and the brightest to come and build our technology enterprise from our citizens, and of course, and from others. And the fourth area is how do we incentivize innovation in industry, whether it's through tax policies and tax credits and things like that in other ways. And then of course the energy initiative is a big piece of this initiative also under pace, and under Rising Above the Gathering Storm, and of course, the whole idea of jobs creation is fundamental. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Mr. MOTE: The whole ideas is to create jobs. FLATOW: Mm hmmm, right. 1-800-989-8255 is our number, let's go to Ed in Lake Elsnore, California. Hi, Ed. ED (caller): Hi, how you doing? FLATOW: Hi there. ED: Hello. FLATOW: Go ahead. ED: Yes, I, my comment was just about the cost of education involved in, well especially in going beyond just the bachelor level. Like, I've gotten through pretty well myself, because I've worked my way through. But I've actually, I actually lost my job recently, right at the end here, I've got two semesters left. But the cost is just overwhelming really. Like, I'm probably not going to be able to go beyond the bachelor level at least for a couple of years, just mainly due to cost. FLATOW: Good question, how do we finance people who want to become educators? ED: Right. FLATOW: And can't afford it? ED: I guess, can I make a comment about the. . . FLATOW: Sure. ED: As far as the teaching problem too, because most, because I'm a math major and most of my fellow students are going to be teachers, but as for myself I look at the cost of pay for teachers based upon like for an engineer for example. And there's a large difference right there. So, when I see there's such a shortage of math teachers you got the cost and, like, I would make the same as say a liberal arts major teaching elementary school, with my degree is, I feel at least a lot harder to acquire. FLATOW: Mm-hmmm. Any comments from the panel. ED: So the disparity in pay is a problem also. Mr. MOTE: Well, I would say that. . . FLATOW:  Thanks, Ed. Mr. MOTE: That's a very good question as, under this Rising Above the Gathering Storm proposal, as a matter of fact, there was a scholarship subsidies for people who take on graduate study for science and technology, but also for science and technology education. And there also was a recommendation of pay differential for people who are highly qualified in teaching this as well. It's a recognition that we need higher pay for highly-skilled people who are going to go into these fields. I think the complexity here is that the K through 12 education is really a local issue. I mean it's not really a federal issue and so that's why the states. . . FLATOW: That's the point I was trying to make before. Mr. MOTE: That's why the states have to come together under this thing themselves and figure out how they're going to essentially adapt to take advantage of these opportunities and recognize the problem we've got. FLATOW: Well, yeah, to recognize the problem, and anybody who has kids in public schools or any school know, that the most important thing in school is sports. I mean it's, the curriculum recognizes that, the superintendent recognizes that, Friday night football rises above everything. You move the clock back to get your kids on the bus stop at 6:30 so the sports teams can have half an hour more to practice in daylight. Who cares if they're sleeping when, the students are sleeping when they get to school. You don't dilute the schools. You may have, schools may be overcrowded, but we're not going to have a new school come on because that's going to dilute the sports team. No one talks about what it's going to do for science or education in the schools. And until you, my view, until you have that discussion we're not going to be competitive with the other countries who believe that that's more important. Mr. MOTE: Well. . . FLATOW: There's my soap box version. Mr. MOTE: There is definitely some painful truth in what you say. FLATOW: So, that's why it's a local problem. That's why I say it's a local problem, you know. Mr. MOTE: Universities have a little bit of this problem now and then. FLATOW: Yeah. Mr. MOTE: But I would say that we need the initiative, yeah we need the people to see at the local level. Frankly this. . . FLATOW: My challenge to you is how do you make that sexy as Friday night football, you know. Dr. Garland, Patricia Garland, what are you gonna, how can you make this, how can you compete and bring an engineer to class, or have a role model and say, well you know, we don't have cheerleaders for these people, but they're important also. Ms. GARLAND: The point is very well made that math and science teachers, technology teachers, could easily make more money outside of the classroom and working in industry. So number one you either have to have a passion to teach, a passion to work with children, or we need to work out ways to have alliances with engineers that are out in the work force to work with the teachers that are in the school systems. How do you make it happen, how do you make it sexy? Once again you change the message. Why are women going into medical professions? We can talk to young women and say, you could work side by side with a doctor as an engineer by building a pacemaker or providing a new technology to develop artificial limbs. Both of those particular work occupations are exciting and they do protect lives of individuals and we save lives. So it is in the messaging. And I think that you can change the message, both for teachers and for students. Dr. MOTE: Ira, you know, I'll just, I'd just like to comment. FLATOW: Go ahead, Dan. Dr. MOTE: I think that the whole thing comes down to opportunity. Young people will respond to opportunity. You know, we've been here before. When Sputnik came up so long ago, 1957, the country surged towards science and technology. There was federal resources. There was a national need. There was a space program. We could go to the moon by 1970 and so on. So, the opportunity was there and people went for it. I think the problem today is that there's been such a walk-away from science and technology. And the opportunity people, young people, see, they see it in professional sports, they see it in other things. And I think we need to create opportunity. We need to create better salaries. In fact, salaries are going up, as a matter of fact, as we speak, in science and technology. And I think when opportunity's there, the nation, and the young people in the nation, will respond. FLATOW: Ralph Wyndrum? Dr. WYNDRUM: I think both points were very well made. One, the opportunity, and two, the message. The IEEE, for example, in the United States currently it has set up a program called TIS, Teacher's in Service partnership, where our members who are excited about engineering, male and female, are going into the public schools, working on preferred arrangements with the teachers, designing experiments so that perhaps one day a week they'll be exposing the students to new and innovative experiments in biology and hard sciences, in mathematics. And this is providing both a message about the future and the opportunity, a first-hand look at what engineering is. And that's in grades K to 12. We've got the baby-boomers going to be retiring. And that's going to be a very important bridge to cross. FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255 is our number. Let's go to Sara in Atlanta. Hi, Sarah. SARA (Caller): Hi. I am currently a graduate student in mathematics. And I want to thank you guys so much for talking about this topic. It's so important. I'm getting ready to head out and start actually teaching at the high school and college levels. And I was wondering what the panel thought my role should be, what can I do to help with this problem. FLATOW: You're certified? You're finished with your education? You have your degrees. . . SARA: Yes. FLATOW: . . . and you're all ready to go. SARA: Yes. FLATOW: What would you, you tell us what you think, Sarah. SARA: What I think? FLATOW: Yes. SARA: I think that it's just a matter of me actually being someone who's highly qualified at being out there. I think that's the number one thing I can do. But I also think it's really hard to inspire students at this age. And I'm not really sure how that's going to happen. FLATOW: Let me ask Patricia Garland to comment after I tell everybody this is TALK OF THE NATION Science Friday from NPR News. Patricia Garland, what do you suggest to Sara? Ms. GARLAND: Well, number one, Sarah, I congratulate you on your career choice. And I think that just by being you, being a female in a mathematics field in a high school is an amazing way to touch the lives of many students. You will be a role model for all the students, both females and males, that come through your classroom. I chose engineering because I had a female chemistry teacher in high school. So, you will be touching the lives of many in a positive way. So just by your career choice, you are doing the right thing to help us with the problem that's on the table today. But second, always make your classroom exciting. Bring in maybe hands-on activities. Also contact us at the Society of Women Engineers so that we can help you to bring engineering concepts into your classroom, as well, to show the students how mathematics can fit the real world activities that they would be doing once they get out of high school and into college. FLATOW: All right, Sara. Good luck to you. Dr. WYNDRUM: You know, a point that I would add here is that teachers like yourself, Sara, will be people who will be able to take sabbaticals. And you'll be able to take, after a few years of teaching, a year off and actually work in industry in your specialty. And you'll be able to bring back even a richer experience if you do that. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. You know, you talked about the Sputnik. We're all, I'm all certainly, a child of the Sputnik generation. It seems like we have an opportunity here for a Sputnik-like era, but we're sort of losing it. And I'm talking about the energy crisis that we, you know, foreign oil, alternative energies. If we could motivate whole bunches of engineers like we've motivated the rocket scientists of the '60s to put their minds to come up with radical new ways or just interesting ways of doing better what we do now, there's an opportunity here, Ralph, that maybe, you know, maybe we're losing. Dr. WYNDRUM: We may well be losing. But I don't know that the industry is geared up to do it at this point. As I said, fundamental research is unfortunately being bypassed for current product research. But the federal government, I think, has a role to play here, just as they did in the Sputnik era. And they have wonderful national laboratories to enable it to be done. Dr. MOTE: Well, Ira, you know, that's a very good question. In fact, one of the things we call about this crisis now is they call it boiling the frog crisis. You know, with Sputnik, it was a sudden crisis. Everybody saw it. It galvanized the nation. And people could get behind it very well. The nation gets behind national security issues. With this crisis we have now, it's happening slowly. You know, you put the frog in the water and you turn the heat up and pretty soon the frog turns green and boils. It's a little different than a sudden crisis. But it's definitely coming. There isn't enough oil in the world for the United States, for China, India, developing countries. So we do have an energy crisis. And I think the government can get behind this initiative, and in fact, it's part of the president's state of the union address, part of Rising Above the Gathering Storm, is to create an energy initiative that would look for not just research in universities but in industry, galvanize new ideas, competitive technologies, try to create an environment where new ideas are going to be highly valued over a range of issues with energy, conservation, nuclear, for example, alternative energy, all these techniques that are going to be required for not only our independence from a security point of view but also our independence in terms of our way of life. FLATOW: All right. We're going to come back after we take a short break. Talking with Ralph Wyndrum, president of IEEE-USA, Patricia Welesko Garland, president of Engineering Week, and also C. D. Mote, president of the University of Maryland. So stay with us. We'll be right back after this short break. Don't go away. (Soundbite of music) FLATOW: You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow. For the rest of the hour, we're going to change gears, and thank our guests talking about education and science. Ralph Wyndrum, president of the IEEE-USA, Patricia Welesko Garland, co-chair of Engineers Week 2006, she's also the program manager of the combined heat and power program at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and C. D. Dan Mote, Jr. , president of the University of Maryland. I want to thank all of them for taking time to be with us today.  IRA FLATOW, host:  From NPR News in New York, this is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow. In his state of the union speech, President Bush introduced a plan to increase spending on science and technology.  President GEORGE W. BUSH: Tonight I announce an American Competitiveness Initiative to encourage innovation throughout our economy and to give our nation's children a firm grounding in math and science.  (Soundbite of applause)  FLATOW: This house, does America need a new initiative for science? And will the president's plan get the job done? And since it's National Engineering Week, we'll talk about plans to get more girls interested in engineering. Plus, does climate have the power to change civilizations, and if so, what might it do to ours and how quickly? It's all coming up after this break. Stay with us.  (Soundbite of music)  FLATOW: You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow. In his State of the Union address, President Bush announced his new American Competitiveness Initiative. Well, that's a plan to commit more than $136 billion over ten years to, quote, \"increase investments in research and development, strengthening education, and encourage entrepreneurship and innovation. \"  The president's announcement came on the heels of a report issued in January by the National Academies. That report is called Rising Above the Gathering Storm, and it warned that, quote, \"the scientific and technological building blocks critical to our economic leadership are eroding. \" Here are just a few of the many points that are made in the report.  China and India are far outpacing the U. S. in awarding of college degrees in engineering, computer science, and information technology. U. S. 12th graders performed below the international average on a test of general knowledge in science and math. And in the U. S. , science and technology workforce in the year 2000, 38 percent of the Ph. D. s were foreign-born. Just a few of the indicators of the status of science and technology included in the report.  So, what can be done to reverse the trend? That's what we'll be talking about this hour. Is the president's new initiative enough? Is it not enough? What more needs to be done? I'm gonna be joined this hour by three engineers, because after all, it is National Engineer's Week. And we'll also take a look at how engineers are working to get girls interested in engineering. If you'd like to get on the conversation, if you'd like to make a contribution, our number is 1-800-989-8255, 1-800-989-TALK, and as always, you can surf over to our website at sciencefriday. com.  Ralph Wyndrum, Jr. is the president of the IEEE-USA. He's an electrical and computer engineer. He worked at Bell Labs in New Jersey for more than 30 years. He joins me here in our New York studios. Thank you for coming in today, Dr. Wyndrum.  Dr. RALPH WYNDRUM, JR. (President, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers): Thank you very much for having us.  FLATOW: You're welcome. Patricia Welesko Garland is the chair of Engineers Week 2006. She is a chemical engineer, program manager of the Combined Heat and Power Program at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and a former Girl Scout troop leader. She joins us from our NPR studios in Washington. Thank you for talking with us today, doctor, uh, Ms. Garland.  MS. PATRICIA WELESKO GARLAND (Chair, Engineers Week 2006): Thank you, Mr. Flatow.  FLATOW: You're welcome. Dan Mote, Jr. , is the president of the University of Maryland. He is also a mechanical engineer, a member of the National Academy of Engineering, he served as a member of the National Academy's Committee on Prospering in the Global Economy of the 21st Century, and the findings of that committee, I read a little bit from it, are found in the report I mentioned, Rising Above the Gathering Storm, Energizing and Employing America for a Brighter Economic Future. He's also in our Washington studios. Thank you for being with us today, Dr. Mote.  Dr. C. D. MOTE, JR. (President, University of Maryland): Thank you, Ira, very much. Please to be here.  FLATOW: I want to just begin with you from the first paragraph of your findings. You say that we fear the abruptness in which a lead in science and technology can be lost and the difficulty of recovering a lead once lost, if it indeed it can be regained at all. Do you fear we have permanently lost our leadership in science and technology?  Dr. MOTE: No, no, clearly. I don't think anybody on this task force, this committee that wrote this report, believes we've lost our leadership in science and technology. I think the concern is that the building blocks for the leadership of the future is what is eroding. In fact, our leadership in science and technology, we must understand, was created decades ago. Our processes and our enterprises of 20 and 30 years ago have led to our leadership today. The question is what will our leadership be 20 years from now, and that is what this report is really about.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Do you think the president's American Competitive Initiative addresses some of those issues that your report talks about?  Dr. MOTE: It definitely does. In fact, I think most of us involved in this enterprise since it started, most recently last summer, believe that the president's state of the union address and the ACI come directly from the recommendations of this report and really is responsive to the issues that are brought forward.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Ralph Wyndrum, what are the problems facing engineering today? We keep hearing about there is a shortage of engineers. Is there a shortage of engineers?  Dr. WYNDRUM: Well, yes, I think there is a shortage of engineers, and I think you have to look beyond the shortage, and you have to look at what has happened to engineering over the last five to 10 years. We've gone away from institutions, such as Bell Laboratories and IBM Research and a number of others, to institutions that are much more concerned with current product.  If I take Bell Laboratories as an example, when it was operating at full thrust, it was the leading institution in the world of its kind. It had courses in innovation. It had in-hours courses. What is happening is, and we have found this out in a 2005 member survey, our engineers are becoming obsolete. Their ability to take courses is less and less, at this point, and our member survey showed that 37 percent of our membership, that's a quarter of a million American engineers, 30 percent of them were concerned and indicated that they needed to have an easy way to continue their education on their own, at this point.  FLATOW: You talk about the quality of keeping present, keeping up-to-date with the engineers, but there also seem to be a pure number of engineers that there's a shortage. Let me just read from the National Academy's report. It says, one estimate is that in 2004, China graduated about 350,000 engineers, computer scientists, information technologists, with four-year degrees, while the U. S. graduated only 14,000. That's 350 versus, I'm sorry, 140,000.  Dr. WYNDRUM: 140,000.  FLATOW: That's still less than half. . .  Dr. WYNDRUM: That's correct.  FLATOW: . . . than what we have, generally.  Dr. WYNDRUM: That's correct. Now, I've spent some time in China, and I have to tell you,t I've been to locations such as Chingwa(ph) University. A very large number, as I think other people are aware, of those engineers are in fact civil engineers. . .  FLATOW: Mm-hmm.  Dr. WYNDRUM: . . . concerned with the infrastructure of China, and so you have to compare the classes of engineering rather than just engineers as a group to understand where the shortages are.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm.  Dr. WYNDRUM: But I think there is little doubt that with the continuing process of increasing engineering education in China, and the quality of engineering education in China, they are going to graduate, certainly, more engineers than we are for a long period of time. I think we need to be concerned, with the explosion of the information age, that we will not have the number of engineers we need for the information explosion, for the innovation that we need in the future.  FLATOW: Patricia Garland, does that concern you, too?  Ms. GARLAND: Absolutely. We need to change our message that we're taking out into colleges and universities to increase our numbers. While. . .  FLATOW: How do you convince someone to become an engineer? And I know you're involved with women engineers. How do you convince a woman to say that you should be going into engineering?  Ms. GARLAND: Well, you can't necessarily convince somebody. What you can do is you can provide them information about engineering that would motivate them to choose engineering. What we're seeing is that we can continue to do what we've been doing in the past, going into the classrooms and telling students that engineering is great for you if you love math and science and if you want a challenging career, but why then aren't the numbers changing? Women make up 46 percent of the workforce, but we've had pretty stable numbers over the last few years where we only make up 11 percent of the engineering work force. And as the number of jobs requiring engineering in this country are increasing, the number of students that are taking technical and engineering classes remain pretty stable.  And of those numbers, women and minorities are still severely under-represented. Women make up 55 percent of all engineering undergraduate, women make up 55 percent of all the undergraduate students in this country. Yet we only are at 20 percent of the undergraduate engineering degrees. And although the numbers in high schools, women are taking equal amounts of classes, such as biology and math, as boys are, at equal numbers. Well, why is it that women aren't taking the same amount of engineering classes as boys?  FLATOW: Why is that?  Ms. GARLAND: Well. . .  FLATOW: Where are they going? We know women are good in science and math.  Ms. GARLAND: A lot of women tend to go into the medical profession or the legal profession. As part of an extraordinary women engineers project, which is a coalition of engineering societies which pull together to take a look at why is it that young women aren't going into engineering. They did a study with some focus groups and interviewed students to find out what motivates young girls to take engineering. And what we're learning is that we aren't providing them the message that they want.  Women want to do work that they find exciting, work that they would find beneficial to society, they want to do work that pays well and offers them flexibility. And we tend to take into the classroom different messages. So as part of National Engineer's Week, the Society of Women Engineers in Northrop Grumman Corporation came up with a connecting educators to engineering program, which is fourfold. Working, taking engineers into the classroom to deliver a different message to the students, and also to work with educators to help them with the messaging that gets across to girls, to get girls excited about engineering, and boys as well.  FLATOW: Well what are you bringing, who comes into the class to say, look I'm an engineer get excited about me? What kind of, how do you do that?  Ms. GARLAND: Well, uh, somebody like myself. The engineering societies as well could offer to their, IEEE for example, would offer to their engineers to go into the classroom to meet with students.  FLATOW: Hmm.  Ms. GARLAND: And in the past, some of us have had some difficulties in trying to navigate through school systems, for example. How do you get with the teachers, how do you get into the classrooms? So part of the connecting program is web in our training that we're offering to engineers over the internet to learn about how to navigate the system, how to prepare the message, how to prepare the presentations, what type of information do girls and boys want to hear regarding engineering?  FLATOW: All right we're going take a short break and come back and talk lots more about science and engineering, applied sciences, and this is National Engineering Week. Talk about what needs to be done so that we don't have, you know a shortage of engineers, a shortage of science students. There's a problem about immigration we'll get into, about visiting science professors, having trouble getting into the country. Just a story this week the President is going to India. India has blocked three scientists who would like to come into the country. We'll talk about that. So stay with us, we'll talk more and take your calls after this break, don't go away.  (Soundbite of music)  FLATOW: You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY, I'm Ira Flatow.  We're talking this hour about science and technology investment in the United States. Our way of celebrating that National Engineers Week with my guests, Ralph Wyndrum, President of the IEEE U. S. A. , Patricia Welesko Garland, Co-Chair of Engineers Week 2006. She's also the manager of the Combined Heat and Power Program at Oak Ridge National Laboratory; and C. D. Mote Jr. , otherwise called Dan, is President of the University of Maryland. Our number 1-800-989-8255.  Is there anything, let me ask, just throw this out, we always hear about the federal government taking an active role in, with students and teachers and things, yet very little of any school budget comes from the federal government, just a few percentage points. School is a local thing, it's by PTA's, committees, taxes, and superintendents, and boards of educations, and things like that. Can the federal government really do anything to influence the direction or is it really, Ralph, up to local people, you know, teachers and people like engineers going into classrooms and changing perceptions there?  Dr. WYNDRUM: Well, there are several things the federal government can do. And if you look at the Protecting the Americas Competitive Edge Act, which is moving through the Senate right now, you will find that money is being set aside in grants to provide an extra year of education in math and science so that we get qualified and deeply trained people in mathematics.  FLATOW: Teachers.  Mr. WYNDRUM: Who are teachers.  FLATOW: That's the real problem isn't it.  Mr. WYNDRUM: Exactly.  FLATOW: Yeah.  Mr. WYNDRUM: I mean in the New York area we have a major shortage of teachers qualified to teach math and science. And the federal government can have a major impact at that level.  FLATOW: Can it really, in the number of teachers it can put out there that . . .  Mr. WYNDRUM: I believe, if it wants to, it could correct the problem.  FLATOW: Mm hmmm.  Mr. WYNDRUM: By providing this additional training and the other grants in those acts. The merit-based scholarships, the continuing education for teachers, that's an important input.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Dan, you say in your report. . .  Mr. MOTE: I would say, Ira, the pace legislations, of which there are three, are basically a direct result of the report, Rising Above the Gathering Storm. And in fact the Senators, that would be Bingham and Alexander, Senator Mikulski and fourth one sorry I've forgotten.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm.  Mr. MOTE: Who have proposed this legislation essentially took these initiatives out of that report. And clearly these, this report is for federal legislation which is to assist at local levels. But the point you're making is an extremely good one. There needs to be effort taken at the local level to follow up on this Rising Above the Gathering Storm at the state and local levels.  That is, the initiative at the federal level has really caught on like wildfire. There's not only the pace legislation but there's also legislation in the House, both bipartisan legislations. There's a lot interest in this.  And in fact, the state of the union address and the ACI Initiative also has this in it from the president's point of view. He has about training teachers and getting professionals in to instruct in the schools. He has an idea that we should bring in 30,000 professionals to teach and essentially train 70,000 teachers who are actually qualified in science and technology as their field in order to teach.  But the state and local level issue is still left hanging as you suggest. Each state, and in fact in regions in the state, they should take on the initiative themselves of looking for how the states will organize under the themes of this pace legislation or under this report, Rising Above the Gathering Storm. In the state of Maryland where we are, we actually have that planned already on the 26 of April. We're gathering all the state leadership under the four or maybe five major themes of this report to essentially see how we could organize the state to put it into kind of synchronization with the federal legislation.  Those themes are the following ones. The K through 12 theme that we've been talking about is one of the very important one. How do we prepare teachers for qualifications to teach science and technology at an advance level and get that done? Second would be basic research, the fundamental building blocks of our technology in the future, especially in engineering or physical sciences, information sciences, and computer sciences.  That's a big need as well. Thirdly is the best and the brightest issue of higher education and international students, and how we're going to essentially get the best and the brightest to come and build our technology enterprise from our citizens, and of course, and from others. And the fourth area is how do we incentivize innovation in industry, whether it's through tax policies and tax credits and things like that in other ways. And then of course the energy initiative is a big piece of this initiative also under pace, and under Rising Above the Gathering Storm, and of course, the whole idea of jobs creation is fundamental.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm.  Mr. MOTE: The whole ideas is to create jobs.  FLATOW: Mm hmmm, right. 1-800-989-8255 is our number, let's go to Ed in Lake Elsnore, California. Hi, Ed.  ED (caller): Hi, how you doing?  FLATOW: Hi there.  ED: Hello.  FLATOW: Go ahead.  ED: Yes, I, my comment was just about the cost of education involved in, well especially in going beyond just the bachelor level. Like, I've gotten through pretty well myself, because I've worked my way through. But I've actually, I actually lost my job recently, right at the end here, I've got two semesters left. But the cost is just overwhelming really. Like, I'm probably not going to be able to go beyond the bachelor level at least for a couple of years, just mainly due to cost.  FLATOW: Good question, how do we finance people who want to become educators?  ED: Right.  FLATOW: And can't afford it?  ED: I guess, can I make a comment about the. . .  FLATOW: Sure.  ED: As far as the teaching problem too, because most, because I'm a math major and most of my fellow students are going to be teachers, but as for myself I look at the cost of pay for teachers based upon like for an engineer for example. And there's a large difference right there. So, when I see there's such a shortage of math teachers you got the cost and, like, I would make the same as say a liberal arts major teaching elementary school, with my degree is, I feel at least a lot harder to acquire.  FLATOW: Mm-hmmm. Any comments from the panel.  ED: So the disparity in pay is a problem also.  Mr. MOTE: Well, I would say that. . .  FLATOW:  Thanks, Ed.  Mr. MOTE: That's a very good question as, under this Rising Above the Gathering Storm proposal, as a matter of fact, there was a scholarship subsidies for people who take on graduate study for science and technology, but also for science and technology education. And there also was a recommendation of pay differential for people who are highly qualified in teaching this as well. It's a recognition that we need higher pay for highly-skilled people who are going to go into these fields. I think the complexity here is that the K through 12 education is really a local issue. I mean it's not really a federal issue and so that's why the states. . .  FLATOW: That's the point I was trying to make before.  Mr. MOTE: That's why the states have to come together under this thing themselves and figure out how they're going to essentially adapt to take advantage of these opportunities and recognize the problem we've got.  FLATOW: Well, yeah, to recognize the problem, and anybody who has kids in public schools or any school know, that the most important thing in school is sports. I mean it's, the curriculum recognizes that, the superintendent recognizes that, Friday night football rises above everything. You move the clock back to get your kids on the bus stop at 6:30 so the sports teams can have half an hour more to practice in daylight. Who cares if they're sleeping when, the students are sleeping when they get to school.  You don't dilute the schools. You may have, schools may be overcrowded, but we're not going to have a new school come on because that's going to dilute the sports team. No one talks about what it's going to do for science or education in the schools. And until you, my view, until you have that discussion we're not going to be competitive with the other countries who believe that that's more important.  Mr. MOTE: Well. . .  FLATOW: There's my soap box version.  Mr. MOTE: There is definitely some painful truth in what you say.  FLATOW: So, that's why it's a local problem. That's why I say it's a local problem, you know.  Mr. MOTE: Universities have a little bit of this problem now and then.  FLATOW: Yeah.  Mr. MOTE: But I would say that we need the initiative, yeah we need the people to see at the local level. Frankly this. . .  FLATOW: My challenge to you is how do you make that sexy as Friday night football, you know. Dr. Garland, Patricia Garland, what are you gonna, how can you make this, how can you compete and bring an engineer to class, or have a role model and say, well you know, we don't have cheerleaders for these people, but they're important also.  Ms. GARLAND: The point is very well made that math and science teachers, technology teachers, could easily make more money outside of the classroom and working in industry. So number one you either have to have a passion to teach, a passion to work with children, or we need to work out ways to have alliances with engineers that are out in the work force to work with the teachers that are in the school systems.  How do you make it happen, how do you make it sexy? Once again you change the message. Why are women going into medical professions? We can talk to young women and say, you could work side by side with a doctor as an engineer by building a pacemaker or providing a new technology to develop artificial limbs.  Both of those particular work occupations are exciting and they do protect lives of individuals and we save lives. So it is in the messaging. And I think that you can change the message, both for teachers and for students.  Dr. MOTE: Ira, you know, I'll just, I'd just like to comment.  FLATOW: Go ahead, Dan.  Dr. MOTE: I think that the whole thing comes down to opportunity. Young people will respond to opportunity. You know, we've been here before. When Sputnik came up so long ago, 1957, the country surged towards science and technology. There was federal resources. There was a national need. There was a space program. We could go to the moon by 1970 and so on. So, the opportunity was there and people went for it. I think the problem today is that there's been such a walk-away from science and technology. And the opportunity people, young people, see, they see it in professional sports, they see it in other things. And I think we need to create opportunity. We need to create better salaries. In fact, salaries are going up, as a matter of fact, as we speak, in science and technology. And I think when opportunity's there, the nation, and the young people in the nation, will respond.  FLATOW: Ralph Wyndrum?  Dr. WYNDRUM: I think both points were very well made. One, the opportunity, and two, the message. The IEEE, for example, in the United States currently it has set up a program called TIS, Teacher's in Service partnership, where our members who are excited about engineering, male and female, are going into the public schools, working on preferred arrangements with the teachers, designing experiments so that perhaps one day a week they'll be exposing the students to new and innovative experiments in biology and hard sciences, in mathematics. And this is providing both a message about the future and the opportunity, a first-hand look at what engineering is. And that's in grades K to 12. We've got the baby-boomers going to be retiring. And that's going to be a very important bridge to cross.  FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255 is our number. Let's go to Sara in Atlanta. Hi, Sarah.  SARA (Caller): Hi. I am currently a graduate student in mathematics. And I want to thank you guys so much for talking about this topic. It's so important. I'm getting ready to head out and start actually teaching at the high school and college levels. And I was wondering what the panel thought my role should be, what can I do to help with this problem.  FLATOW: You're certified? You're finished with your education? You have your degrees. . .  SARA: Yes.  FLATOW: . . . and you're all ready to go.  SARA: Yes.  FLATOW: What would you, you tell us what you think, Sarah.  SARA: What I think?  FLATOW: Yes.  SARA: I think that it's just a matter of me actually being someone who's highly qualified at being out there. I think that's the number one thing I can do. But I also think it's really hard to inspire students at this age. And I'm not really sure how that's going to happen.  FLATOW: Let me ask Patricia Garland to comment after I tell everybody this is TALK OF THE NATION Science Friday from NPR News. Patricia Garland, what do you suggest to Sara?  Ms. GARLAND: Well, number one, Sarah, I congratulate you on your career choice. And I think that just by being you, being a female in a mathematics field in a high school is an amazing way to touch the lives of many students. You will be a role model for all the students, both females and males, that come through your classroom. I chose engineering because I had a female chemistry teacher in high school. So, you will be touching the lives of many in a positive way. So just by your career choice, you are doing the right thing to help us with the problem that's on the table today.  But second, always make your classroom exciting. Bring in maybe hands-on activities. Also contact us at the Society of Women Engineers so that we can help you to bring engineering concepts into your classroom, as well, to show the students how mathematics can fit the real world activities that they would be doing once they get out of high school and into college.  FLATOW: All right, Sara. Good luck to you.  Dr. WYNDRUM: You know, a point that I would add here is that teachers like yourself, Sara, will be people who will be able to take sabbaticals. And you'll be able to take, after a few years of teaching, a year off and actually work in industry in your specialty. And you'll be able to bring back even a richer experience if you do that.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm. You know, you talked about the Sputnik. We're all, I'm all certainly, a child of the Sputnik generation. It seems like we have an opportunity here for a Sputnik-like era, but we're sort of losing it. And I'm talking about the energy crisis that we, you know, foreign oil, alternative energies. If we could motivate whole bunches of engineers like we've motivated the rocket scientists of the '60s to put their minds to come up with radical new ways or just interesting ways of doing better what we do now, there's an opportunity here, Ralph, that maybe, you know, maybe we're losing.  Dr. WYNDRUM: We may well be losing. But I don't know that the industry is geared up to do it at this point. As I said, fundamental research is unfortunately being bypassed for current product research. But the federal government, I think, has a role to play here, just as they did in the Sputnik era. And they have wonderful national laboratories to enable it to be done.  Dr. MOTE: Well, Ira, you know, that's a very good question. In fact, one of the things we call about this crisis now is they call it boiling the frog crisis. You know, with Sputnik, it was a sudden crisis. Everybody saw it. It galvanized the nation. And people could get behind it very well. The nation gets behind national security issues. With this crisis we have now, it's happening slowly. You know, you put the frog in the water and you turn the heat up and pretty soon the frog turns green and boils. It's a little different than a sudden crisis. But it's definitely coming.  There isn't enough oil in the world for the United States, for China, India, developing countries. So we do have an energy crisis. And I think the government can get behind this initiative, and in fact, it's part of the president's state of the union address, part of Rising Above the Gathering Storm, is to create an energy initiative that would look for not just research in universities but in industry, galvanize new ideas, competitive technologies, try to create an environment where new ideas are going to be highly valued over a range of issues with energy, conservation, nuclear, for example, alternative energy, all these techniques that are going to be required for not only our independence from a security point of view but also our independence in terms of our way of life.  FLATOW: All right. We're going to come back after we take a short break. Talking with Ralph Wyndrum, president of IEEE-USA, Patricia Welesko Garland, president of Engineering Week, and also C. D. Mote, president of the University of Maryland. So stay with us. We'll be right back after this short break. Don't go away.  (Soundbite of music)  FLATOW: You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow. For the rest of the hour, we're going to change gears, and thank our guests talking about education and science. Ralph Wyndrum, president of the IEEE-USA, Patricia Welesko Garland, co-chair of Engineers Week 2006, she's also the program manager of the combined heat and power program at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and C. D. Dan Mote, Jr. , president of the University of Maryland. I want to thank all of them for taking time to be with us today. ", "section": "Science", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2006 NPR.

(Soundbite of music) INSKEEP: The House of Representatives is scheduled to vote today on a bill that would change food warning labels. It would require states to follow federal rules in determining which foods carry warning labels. The food industry says greater uniformity will end consumer confusion. State officials and consumer groups say it'll end efforts to safeguard public health. NPR's Greg Allen has more. GREG ALLEN reporting: California goes further than any other state in the country in requiring warning labels. Browsing through a supermarket in the golden state, a shopper might notice signs warning of the health risks of consuming swordfish, alcohol, even certain fruits, nuts and vegetables. Under Proposition 65, passed in the 1980s California requires businesses to notify consumers if any potentially harmful chemicals are present in their products. Currently, there are more than 700 substances covered under the law. Proposition 65 is one of the reasons why a large and powerful group of manufacturers, food processors and retailers is pushing for federal legislation that would override state labeling laws. The National Uniformity for Food Act would require states to follow federal guidelines in food safety labeling, immediately superceding Prop. 65 and some 200 other state laws. Stephanie Childs is with the Grocery Manufacturers Association. Ms. STEPHANIE CHILDS (Grocery Manufacturers Association): We believe it's important to assume that consumers in all 50 states have the same information available to them about the safety of their products. What this legislation does is ensure that the states and the federal government are working together to bring the best science to the national level. ALLEN: Childs says the measure would not affect state inspections and labeling for sanitation reasons or fact-based labeling. Alaska's requirement, for example, that farm-raised salmon carry that designation. And she says states would be able to petition the Food and Drug Administration for exemptions from the law. Even so, opponents worry the bill might actually weaken consumer protections. State officials are among those most opposed. They worry it will cripple their efforts to regulate food safety. Charlie Ingram is with the National Association of State Departments of Agriculture. Mr. CHARLIE INGRAM (Liaison, National Association of State Departments of Agriculture): We are concerned that this will hamper the state's ability to carry out the programs and laws and rules to protect the food supply. And it sets up a cumbersome, bureaucratic petition process that states would have to go through to get federal approval before they could do their work. ALLEN: An analysis by the Congressional Budget Office says the way the bill is written says it's not clear whether it applies just to labeling or whether it would apply more broadly to other aspects of food safety regulation, like inspections. Consumer groups have another concern. Susanna Montezemolo of Consumer's Union says states like California often lead the way on environmental and consumer issues and this bill would stop them from adopting state laws that are considerably more stringent that federal laws. That, she says, would hurt consumers. Ms. SUSANNA MONTEZEMOLO (Policy Analyst, Consumer's Union): The problem is that the federal government, in so many instances, just hasn't done the work. And when they have done the work, it's often weaker than the work the states have done. So the standards would overall be lower. We think it would lead to more food-borne illnesses and certainly, all the labeling laws that have been enacted in the state level would be wiped out. ALLEN: Montezemolo thinks she knows why there's been some confusion over what the bill would and would not do. Although it's been introduced in every Congress since 1998, it's never yet received a hearing either in the House or the Senate. If the effort to supercede state food safety laws does pass in the House, opponents say it still faces an uphill battle in the Senate, in part because of strong opposition from California senators Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein.

It's the third case of mad cow disease detected in this country. Agriculture officials say the animal's carcass was buried and was not used for animal or human food. Joining me now to discuss this case and its ramifications is NPR's Science Correspondent Joe Palca. Good morning, Joe. JOE PALCA reporting: Good morning, Renee. MONTAGNE: How did the USDA become aware of this case? PALCA: Well, as you said, there was an animal that was sick on a farm and the veterinarian was called in. And the animal wasn't able to walk any longer, so they killed it, euthanized it and buried the carcass and then sent a sample to a USDA testing lab, or a lab sponsored by the USDA, where the sample showed positive and preliminary signs of BSC, mad cow disease. MONTAGNE: Well, you say positive and preliminary. How certain that this is mad cow disease? PALCA: Well, the way it works is that the USDA is conducting a fairly large screening program where they've now screened about 650,000 cows in the last 18 months. And when they get an inconclusive or marginally positive test, they send it on for additional testing. And when they sent this to a specialized lab that does the more sophisticated testing, the more sensitive testing, it came back positive. There's still one more test outstanding that they are waiting for the results on, but they've decided that the first test, confirmatory test was enough to go ahead and say that this animal had mad cow. MONTAGNE: And each time one of these few cases has come up, one thinks, is this just the start? What about government officials, what are they thinking here? PALCA: Well, their argument is this is probably not the start. This is the third case that's been detected in this country. In this case, the good news for people, I suppose, is that the animal was over 10 years old, which means it was born before a ban on certain feed products was put in place. Mad cow is transmitted probably, most likely, there's still some uncertainty, but the most likely transmission route is from contaminated feed. And it used to be that they would ground up animals and feed them back to cows. And that was how the disease was being transmitted in Europe. So the USDA said, okay, you can't grind up animals and feed them back to cow anymore. And that started in 1997. And so this cow was born before that and so they're saying, well, we haven't seen a younger cow get the disease, so we're feeling pretty good about the ban. MONTAGNE: So then should people be worried about the safety of American meat? Doesn't sound like you think so. PALCA: Well, nobody, even the consumer groups that are very concerned about the whole issue of food safety, they're not blowing whistles and saying, you know, watch out, there's a problem here, at least they're not saying that there's a big problem. And the reason is that it's just such a small risk of getting mad cow disease from tainted meat, the human form, that people feel it's just, there's not, it's not significant enough to worry about. That said, there are things that people can do and there have been suggestions, for example, they don't know how old this animal is because they don't have exact records. They had to judge from the teeth. And they said, why don't we keep better records so we know we're animals came from? MONTAGNE: And what about U. S. beef exports? PALCA: Well, U. S. wants to start selling beef to Japan again, and this is not going to help at all. Korea was supposed to. They may say no now too. It's hard to say. MONTAGNE: Joe, thanks very much.

I'm Ira Flatow. A new exhibition featuring dissected human bodies is on display in New York. The exhibition is not for the squeamish. Visitors to Bodies: the Exhibition will greeted by more than 20 whole cadavers, 260 body parts dissected and arranged to provide quite an anatomy lesson. The cadavers have been preserved or plasticized using polymers of various colors and to highlight the nervous system or the circulatory system, for example. The exhibit in New York is just one of many of these types of exhibits making their way through museums and exhibit halls around the world. They have caused controversy and drawn record crowds. People are flocking to see the exhibit, but they're also questioning the ethics behind displaying bodies of the dead. Is it for science, for art, for entertainment, or for all of these? Joining me now to talk more about it is my guest, Dr. Roy Glover, professor emeritus of anatomy and cell biology at the University of Michigan. He's also the former Chief Medical Director at the Medical School, Polymer Preservation Laboratory there, he currently serves as chief medical advisor for Premier Exhibitions, the company that has organized the Bodies: The Exhibition, on view here in New York.  He's here in our New York bureau, welcome to the program. Dr. ROY GLOVER, M. D. (University of Michigan, Polymer Preservation Laboratory): Thank you for having me. FLATOW: I have to say, there are crowds through that exhibit. Dr. GLOVER: We're very excited that people are coming and learning and are taking better care of themselves. That's the bottom line, as far as we're concerned. FLATOW: As a result of the exhibit, they're taking better care of themselves? Dr. GLOVER: Absolutely. Absolutely, I think people leave their packs of cigarettes behind them, they make conscious choices to eat a better diet, to exercise more. And that's one of the goals of the exhibition: to get people to more seriously consider the health-related choices they make. FLATOW: Let's walk through the exhibit for a little bit. You come in and you see various human bodies in various poses. Dr. GLOVER: Correct. FLATOW: And dissected? Dr. GLOVER: Yes, the way the galleries are laid out, they are laid out in a very organized way. You start with a look at the skeleton and then proceed to add muscles to the skeleton, then there's a nervous system gallery, a circulatory gallery. So it's all set out, not helter-skelter, but in a way that optimizes a persons ability to see and learn. And there are real dissected bodies, each of them in a particular gallery, highlighting a particular system. They are posed, many of them are athletic poses, because with March Madness upon us and the interest that we have in sports, it's a way for people to understand better and especially for children to get excited about the exhibition. FLATOW: Do you get complaints though from people who say this is a dead body you're actually looking at, posed throwing a football? Dr. GLOVER: In general no. there are a few people who have said they are a little bit concerned about the exhibition. Unfortunately, we've never had a chance to talk in person with them, to understand their point of view and to be able to discuss our point of view with them. In general the response has been very, very positive. The people that leave comments at the end are very, very supportive of what we're doing. They think it's an opportunity for them to make a personal choice to come and see. And I can say that, from my point of view, having worked in anatomy over a long period of time, that the exhibition is done with great respect and dignity. And that's a very, very important concern for us. FLATOW: Where do the bodies come from? Dr. GLOVER: The bodies that we have on display at this exhibition here in New York City all came from China. They were obtained there, dissected there in a medical school. They were obtained through the normal processes by the medical school. And now, we at Premier are partnering with the medical school in China. The bodies do not belong to us, they still belong to the medical school there. But they have the best dissectors in the world working there. And so it was an easy decision for us to make to partner there and to have the benefit of working with such competent anatomists. FLATOW: So these, would these bodies have been cadavers on a medical school someplace if they hadn't been here, or what would have happened to these bodies? Dr. GLOVER: Right, they would be used at a medical school for education and research in just the same way. We feel very, very comfortable that this is a very important educational venue in which we are displaying them, and we feel that it's an ideal use of the body now that preservation is possible. And the opportunity for people to come and see is available. FLATOW: I have to say, I saw the exhibit and it's quite an impressive learning experience. I mean you get to see parts of your body and to see how it's all put together that is, you never get see before, any other way. Dr. GLOVER: Yeah, I think it's a very, very complicated body that we live in. When medical students graduate from medical school, they're very apprehensive about going out and practicing, because they realize themselves, after four years of study, that they've learned very little about the body, and would like to know more. Now, we're not trying to turn the public into medical students, but we do feel they ought to know more about themselves. Some people take better care of their cars then they do of their bodies. And we feel that our bodies are our most precious possession and we do need to take better care of them. FLATOW: I noticed that most of the bodies were men. There are, I think, only two women. Dr. GLOVER: That's true and everybody notices that, and we have talked with our partner in China, and they use the bodies that are available to them. And, so we do answer that question often. We wish there were more female bodies to use in the exhibition, and hopefully in the future there will be. FLATOW: And how do the bodies get to be bodies. I mean are, what is the process, are they unclaimed, or do people donate their bodies, or how does that work? Dr. GLOVER: The bodies that we have on display here were unclaimed. That is, these individuals died, there were no next of kin. And so the body was then given to or made available to the medical school for use in an educational and research way. Same thing is true, happens in the United States when a person dies and no next of kin claims the body, the state will make the body available to the medical school. So they're used in exactly the same way. FLATOW: All right, I think people might object that there, this is, this is for entertainment that you're using these bodies, because there's football, somebody's throwing a football, somebody's shooting a basketball, and this may, you know, may be objectionable to some people think that these are dead people being used, posed for an entertaining purpose. Dr. GLOVER: Well, unfortunately, in our society there has to be some entertaining value to what it is that you do. It attracts people's attention, we don't do it to show disrespect for the body, but we do do it to show the body in a dynamic way, rather than a non-dynamic way. And so posing them, basically using athletic poses allows us to highlight the muscular system and various other systems which are all involved in that particular motion. FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255, is our number. Let's go to the phones, to Jackie in Reno, Nevada, hi Jackie. JACKIE (Caller): Hi, how you doing? FLATOW: Hi. JACKIE: I am a physician and I have two girls who are six and eight and obviously I would ask them first if they wanted to go, but I would be all for taking my kids to see something like that. Because at any age if you can get kids involved in science and interested in it, even if it's partially entertaining, that's what gets them involved and interested. And so I fully support it. And I remember standing around our cadaver table and, you know, you kind of wonder would you rather be a cadaver or a cross section. I don't know if I ever decided which one I would rather be, but I, you know, always respected the people who also donated their bodies for that kind of endeavor for medical schools and stuff. FLATOW: All right, thank you for calling. JACKIE: All right take care, bye-bye. FLATOW: Bye-bye.  1-800-989-8255, let's go to Sheila in Macomb, Michigan, is it Macomb, Sheila. SHEILA, caller: Yes it's Macomb, Michigan. My question is why you feel compelled to use real bodies, rather than simply using manufactured models, which seems to me could accomplish the same thing. And I'll take my answer off the air. FLATOW: Okay, thanks. Dr. Glover? Dr. GLOVER: Well that's a good question. Models are a professional artist's idea of what the body ideally looks like. And in fact the body looks often very different than that. In fact to really see and understand, you need to study a real body, and that's the closest you can get to understanding yourself. We say the body never lies, all bodies are different and examining a real body is the best way to demonstrate that. FLATOW: Now these are not bodies that are preserved in formaldehyde and mounted, right?  Describe the process? Dr. GLOVER: No, in fact all the toxic fluids are removed, so that they are very safe to handle. At the end of our exhibition, there is an interactive booth where people can choose to do that if they want. But, in general, what we do is we remove all of the ingredients from the body, the water and other materials that would cause it to decay. And in its place we impregnate the body with liquid silicone rubber, so that the entire body is saturated with the rubber. And then it's hardened by the application of a catalyst, which makes the specimen dry and odorless and safe to handle. FLATOW: And one of the intriguing parts of the exhibit are, not the bodies themselves but the circulatory systems sitting by itself, or the whole nervous system dissected by itself and just to see the complexity of it is, is amazing. Dr. GLOVER: I think when people go to the exhibition they are looking pretty much at the outside of our bodies, I mean, outside of the organs, like the liver and the kidney. But what's even more fascinating is to look at the inside. And one can do that by injecting the various structures within the organ and then removing the tissue from around it so that you can actually see the beauty of what's inside. FLATOW: Let's go to Michelle in Westchester, New York. Hi, Michelle. MICHELLE (Caller): Hi. How are you? FLATOW: Hi. MICHELLE: I wanted to say, first off, as a nurse I very much respect whatever you can do in science to eliminate that of the body. However, I was concerned that I had read somewhere that perhaps these bodies came into possession through either being prisoners, or even if they were unclaimed, what would the rights of those peoples be, villages or otherwise, to not have their bodies used in this fashion. And I'll take my question off the air. Thanks. FLATOW: Okay. Thank you. Dr. GLOVER: The bodies were obtained legally. And there are documents to authenticate that. It's just that all of this process is extremely confidential as it is in our country. So disclosing the documents isn't something that we would otherwise normally do. But you can be assured that the people that have, are supposed to see and examine the documents have had a chance to do that. Using unclaimed bodies does provide for some people a serious concern. But yet, again, we're trying to understand exactly how the body works. We're trying to make people more knowledgeable about themselves in an effort to better care for themselves. And so it would be preferable, of course, to have people who would otherwise make a conscious donation. And we're working in that direction. But for the moment, the use of unclaimed bodies, we feel very comfortable with that. FLATOW: It seems that bodies, exhibits, television shows about bodies, or, you know, we have CSI, we have all these forensic shows that deal basically with human anatomy, Michael Boden, medical examiner, has a show about autopsies, does autopsies on HBO now. What is the craze about bodies now? It's unbelievable what's happening with --Dr. GLOVER: Well, it's all about ourselves. And this morning I got up and I learned about my prostate while I was having breakfast. And I watched blood flow through my heart during the afternoon. Information about our bodies is everywhere. And if you only pick up the newspaper or turn on the television and count the number of times that you either hear or read about or see information about your body, it's amazing. But yet we don't understand that information and we don't know how to use it or understand it. And so this is an attempt to bridge that gap to make all of that information which is currently available a lot more understandable and intelligible to the average person. FLATOW: Talking with Dr. Roy Glover who serves as chief medical advisor for Premier Exhibitions on TALK OF THE NATION: Science Friday from NPR News. Let's go to the phones. Let's see. First let's go to Shaun in Anchorage. Hi, Shaun. SHAUN (Caller): Hello. FLATOW: Hi. SHAUN: Thank you very much for taking my call. I am an experienced physician and had the opportunity to see Gunter Von Hagan's Body Worlds in Philadelphia last fall. And I was absolutely, you know, overwhelmed with the entire experience, both from a scientific standpoint and from, I would say, a spiritual standpoint with viewing the exhibition and those bodies. And in fact I felt so strongly about it that I arranged to have my family travel back east so my 9 and 11-year-old children could see the exhibition as well. And they found it a very meaningful learning experience. So I'm in full support of this type of exhibition. And I felt it was done very, very well and very respectfully. FLATOW: Did you find yourself more impressed with your body after you saw the other body? SHAUN: Well, I'm a specialist in physical medicine rehabilitation so --FLATOW: Oh, so you're --SHAUN: -- I deal with anatomy all the time. And one of the things that was impressive to me was that the preservation techniques were such that the display of anatomic detail was far superior to the cadavers that we used in medical school dissection labs. FLATOW: Well, thanks for calling. SHAUN: I really learned quite a bit that even as an experienced physician that I'm able to use in practice. FLATOW: Thank you for calling. And good luck to you. SHAUN: Thank you. FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255. Let's to go Liz in Cincinnati. Hi, Liz. LIZ (Caller): Hi. I just, I also saw Body Worlds in Chicago. Thank you for taking my call. I did see it in Chicago. You've heard from two medical professionals, both of whom have said they've taken children. My husband and I happened into that exhibit not really knowing, actually, before we walked in that that's actually what they were, were human cadavers. I would highly caution people. My eight year old didn't really get it. He could not connect that they were actually people. When you see how well preserved they are, they really do just look like plastic. But you can literally stand inches away from bodies that are posed. My 11 and a half-year-old ran through the exhibit. He was extremely upset by it. So my call is just to say I found it tastefully done, very reverently done, I have to say. But I highly caution people to understand your child before you walk into that exhibit because it is a very powerful experience as well as a learning experience. And that was just my comment. FLATOW: Thank you for calling. Let me just tell our listeners that if they want to see some of these pictures, they can go to our Web site at www. sciencefriday. com. We have a little bit of slide show from your Bodies: The Exhibition. Dr. GLOVER: I'd like to say that I agree very, very much with that comment of the last caller. We, in fact, encourage parents to talk with their children about the exhibition before they bring them. And also in terms of school groups that come, we often invite the teachers to come in advance and educators to come in advance so that they can actually see what the exhibition is about. And then we help prepare materials to help them to introduce their students to the exhibition, to come and learn from it and then to debrief them and to get their comments after they've been in attendance. FLATOW: Is it going to be moving another place after South Street Seaport? Dr. GLOVER: It will. I don't know exactly where that will be. We hope to be in New York for an extended period of time. We're doing very, very well at the South Street. People are coming in large numbers. And as long as people are interested in attending and they're wanting to see the exhibition, we hope to be able to keep it in New York for some time. But then it will move to another city. Where that will be is basically up to the representatives of the company. FLATOW: Dr. Glover, thank you for taking time to be with us. Dr. GLOVER: I appreciate your having me. FLATOW: Roy Glover serves as chief medical advisor for Premier Exhibitions, the company that has organized Bodies: The Exhibition on view here at the South Street Seaport in New York. We're going to take short break and come back. We're going to change gears and talk about patents. The Supreme Court's actually look at four patent cases. We'll talk about one in particular, very unusual. We'll talk about why it's so important. Stay with us. We'll be right back.  IRA FLATOW, host:  You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION: Science Friday. I'm Ira Flatow.  A new exhibition featuring dissected human bodies is on display in New York. The exhibition is not for the squeamish. Visitors to Bodies: the Exhibition will greeted by more than 20 whole cadavers, 260 body parts dissected and arranged to provide quite an anatomy lesson. The cadavers have been preserved or plasticized using polymers of various colors and to highlight the nervous system or the circulatory system, for example.  The exhibit in New York is just one of many of these types of exhibits making their way through museums and exhibit halls around the world. They have caused controversy and drawn record crowds. People are flocking to see the exhibit, but they're also questioning the ethics behind displaying bodies of the dead. Is it for science, for art, for entertainment, or for all of these?  Joining me now to talk more about it is my guest, Dr. Roy Glover, professor emeritus of anatomy and cell biology at the University of Michigan. He's also the former Chief Medical Director at the Medical School, Polymer Preservation Laboratory there, he currently serves as chief medical advisor for Premier Exhibitions, the company that has organized the Bodies: The Exhibition, on view here in New York.  He's here in our New York bureau, welcome to the program.  Dr. ROY GLOVER, M. D. (University of Michigan, Polymer Preservation Laboratory): Thank you for having me.  FLATOW: I have to say, there are crowds through that exhibit.  Dr. GLOVER: We're very excited that people are coming and learning and are taking better care of themselves. That's the bottom line, as far as we're concerned.  FLATOW: As a result of the exhibit, they're taking better care of themselves?  Dr. GLOVER: Absolutely. Absolutely, I think people leave their packs of cigarettes behind them, they make conscious choices to eat a better diet, to exercise more. And that's one of the goals of the exhibition: to get people to more seriously consider the health-related choices they make.  FLATOW: Let's walk through the exhibit for a little bit. You come in and you see various human bodies in various poses.  Dr. GLOVER: Correct.  FLATOW: And dissected?  Dr. GLOVER: Yes, the way the galleries are laid out, they are laid out in a very organized way. You start with a look at the skeleton and then proceed to add muscles to the skeleton, then there's a nervous system gallery, a circulatory gallery. So it's all set out, not helter-skelter, but in a way that optimizes a persons ability to see and learn.  And there are real dissected bodies, each of them in a particular gallery, highlighting a particular system. They are posed, many of them are athletic poses, because with March Madness upon us and the interest that we have in sports, it's a way for people to understand better and especially for children to get excited about the exhibition.  FLATOW: Do you get complaints though from people who say this is a dead body you're actually looking at, posed throwing a football?  Dr. GLOVER: In general no. there are a few people who have said they are a little bit concerned about the exhibition. Unfortunately, we've never had a chance to talk in person with them, to understand their point of view and to be able to discuss our point of view with them.  In general the response has been very, very positive. The people that leave comments at the end are very, very supportive of what we're doing. They think it's an opportunity for them to make a personal choice to come and see. And I can say that, from my point of view, having worked in anatomy over a long period of time, that the exhibition is done with great respect and dignity.

JOE PALCA reporting: It's generally, though not always, thought that consuming a diet high in omega-3 fatty acids helps prevent heart disease. Why isn't exactly clear, but that's another story. A diet high in omega-3 fatty acids means eating foods like flax seed and mackerel. Omega-3 is not present, to any great degree, in animals. But two years ago University of Pittsburgh scientist Yifan Dai saw a scientific paper that gave him an idea. The paper described a modified gene that could change omega-6 fatty acids, normally found in mammals, into omega-3. The paper showed if you put this altered gene into mice, you get mice with high levels of omega-3. Dai figured if it works for mice, why not bigger animals? Mr. YIFAN DAI (Scientist, University of Pittsburgh): I realized we don't eat fish anymore, we can eat livestock, pork or maybe beef. PALCA: Dai decided to start with pigs. The problem was, how do you get this gene into pigs? But Dai had already figured that out. Dai put the genes into pig cells in the lab and then turned things over to Randall Prather to get it into live pigs. Mr. DAI: He's quite famous because he runs the pig cloning center and he has all the expertise to clone the pigs. PALCA: The pig cloning center is at the University of Missouri and Prather says he was happy to help Dai with his scheme. Dr. RANDALL PRATHER (Professor of Reproductive Biotechnology, University of Missouri-Columbia): I would like to get up in the morning and have some omega-3 bacon that was good for me.  PALCA: So Prather, or more accurately his post-Docs, got to work making cloned pigs. They did it the traditional way, if  you can say such a word about a technology less than a decade old. You start with a pig egg and remove most of the egg's DNA.  Dr. PRATHER: And then you replace that with the donor cells or the cells in this case that came from Pittsburgh that were genetically modified and then you transfer those back into a pig and hopefully you'll get pigs out the other end at three months, three weeks and three days later.  PALCA: For those of you not up on porcine reproduction, that's a normal pig pregnancy. Sure enough, three months, three weeks and three days after transferring the embryos containing the modified gene, five litters of cloned pigs were born. And these modified piglets had way more omega-3 fatty acid than normal pigs have. Not nearly as much as fish, but still a lot for a pig. Piglet four had particularly high levels, but he also had a heart condition sometimes found in cloned pigs and three weeks after birth, his death seemed imminent, so Prather decided to clone him. Last November, a litter of piglet four clones was born. Dr. PRATHER: We have five of them and these pigs will basically serve as the nucleus for a breeding herd. And we won't do any experiments on them, we will simply use them to produce more animals. PALCA: Now lest you think that heart healthy bacon is just around the corner, Bob Wall of the U. S. Department of Agriculture's Animal Research Service would like to add a note of caution. Mr. BOB WALL (U. S. Department of Agriculture's Animal Research Service): I think it's a little early to tell whether these animals, when they reach market weight, are gonna have the right body composition to achieve the nutritional goals that they have set themselves out for. PALCA: And even if the adult pigs have all the right fat in all the right places, Wall says the Food and Drug Administration will want to take a good, long look at these pigs to make sure they're safe to eat. Besides, it will take at least a few years to breed enough of these pigs to bring them to  market. But I have an idea that might get omega-3 meat on the table a bit faster. Jim Kang is a scientist at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. He did the work in mice that showed that you could get mammals with omega-3 fatty acids in their bodies. I asked Kang how the amount of omega-3 in mice compared with the omega-3 in pigs. Dr. JIM KANG (Scientist, Massachusetts General Hospital): The mice have a higher percentage of the omega-3 than what we have in the pig so far. PALCA: So why don't you try to get people interested in a diet of mice? Dr. KANG: You mean made of mice and use the mice as food? PALCA: Yeah, yeah. Dr. KANG: Yeah, this is possible. That's great. PALCA: If Kang makes millions from minced mouse meat, I want ten percent. Joe Palca, NPR News, Washington.

Mr. Cox, welcome to DAY TO DAY. Mr. STEVEN COX (Chief Executive The Royal Society): Hello. CHADWICK: You've just acquired something called The Journal of Robert Hooke, which the BBC describes as a lost manuscript that charts the birth of modern science. What is the Hooke journal? Mr. COX: Well, the Hooke journal did disappear from the Royal Society back in the 1670s. It is the actual record of meetings of the Royal Society written down by Robert Hooke at the time and Robert Hooke was the secretary of the Royal Society. He was also a very famous experimentalist scientist of very considerable repute. CHADWICK: Explain the role of the Royal Society at the time, would you? Mr. COX: Yeah, of course. We were a new organization, just been set up by the king to work out how to view the world from the perspective of observation, experimentation, and so on, and basically, the beginnings of modern science as we know it today. CHADWICK: And who was sitting around in the society talking things over then? Mr. COX: The sorts of people sitting around the table were people like Isaac Newton, Robert Hooke, Samuel Pepys, Halley as in Halley's Comet and so on and so forth. These are people who really started science as we know it today and the work they did and the discussions they had were what set us off on the modern scientific revolution. CHADWICK: And the development of microscope and the whole idea of gravity, this is all happening in the Royal Society? Mr. COX: This is all happening at meetings of the Royal Society, yes. CHADWICK: What happened to Mr. Hooke's journal? Mr. COX: We think, we don't know actually, but we think he or his biographer took them away from the Royal Society and they never came back. We know they're missing because we have a gap in our record here and they suddenly turned up about six months ago at the bottom of somebody's wardrobe in Hampshire, which is in southern England. CHADWICK: An auctioneer had gone to look through some things and found this manuscript in this cupboard, essentially? Mr. COX: It's one of those classic occasions that you don't think really ever happens, but that is exactly what happened, yeah. CHADWICK: You've just bought it at an auction for a million pounds, is that it? What is that in dollars, a million and a half dollars? Mr. COX: It's about a million and a half dollars, yeah. So, quite a lot of money for a manuscript, but something that is really so important because it shows things like the first time the word cell, as in C-E double L was used, the details of the arguments that took place between Isaac Newton and Robert Hooke about the nature of gravity and about the way in which the world works. . . CHADWICK: Mr. Hooke and Mr. Newton didn't actually get along, did they? Mr. COX: No, they didn't. In fact, they were at loggerheads all the time. Isaac Newton wrote in a letter to Robert -- Robert Hooke was a very, very small man and everybody made fun of him, and Isaac Newton put something about standing on the shoulder of giants, so it was sarcastic, and they really didn't get on. There's a lovely story about Newton destroying all of Hooke's portraits. We have eight or nine portraits of Newton, but none of Robert Hooke, so we never knew what happened to those either. CHADWICK: If this journal has been missing for all these hundreds of years Mr. Cox, how do you know exactly what's in it? Mr. COX: Well, we don't, that's the fascinating thing about it. We know some of what's in it, because there are other records, of course, from the same period, but we haven't yet got it physically, and scholars and the Royal Society are looking and waiting with baited breath to find out exactly what is in it, and what new things we're going to discover about that period.

Jennifer Ouellette is a self-described physics-phobe who couldn't tell a quark from a cathode ray. After avoiding the subject for more than 25 years, she stumbled into science writing as a freelance journalist and began to explore the fundamentals of physics from a cultural and historical perspective.  Now an established science writer, Jennifer Ouellette wants us to understand that rather than being a cold, hard discipline, physics has emotional content. Her new book is called Black Bodies and Quantum Cats, Tales from the Annals of Physics, and she's in our studio here in Washington. Welcome. Ms. JENNIFER OUELLETTE (Freelance Journalist and Author, Black Bodies and Quantum Cats, Tales from the Annals of Physics): Thanks for having me.  HANSEN: What was it exactly that cured you of your physics phobia? Ms. OUELLETTE: Well, that's a very funny story, actually. I was working for the American Physical Society back when they had their offices in New York City, and in the course of that job, which was pretty much administrative assistant and doing some writing on the side, I ran into a lot of Nobel laureates. And I was very intimidated by them. These were brilliant men. They'd done these groundbreaking studies that had changed the world.  And one day, I walk into the Xerox room and there were literally three Nobel laureates standing around the Xerox machine going, do we press start? And what it told me. . . (Soundbite of laughter) Ms. OUELLETTE: . . . is that the key is unfamiliarity. If we're not familiar with something, we fear it. And that was certainly the case with me and physics.  HANSEN: Leonardo da Vinci, a 16th century artist, scientist, he can be connected in your book to a very modern product, Leonardo da Vinci and Ready Whip.  Ms. OUELLETTE: Leonardo da Vinci and Ready Whip. HANSEN: He, you're right, was interested in the properties of foam. Ms. OUELLETTE: Yes. He studied bubbles. He didn't have a great deal of means for studying bubbles. Bubbles are very ephemeral, which is why they're so difficult to study. I mean they're there for a moment, you enjoy them and they're gone. It's a bit like sound. Today we can record a sound and go back and study its properties. It's much harder to do it with bubbles, so he pretty much had to sit there next to a stream and watch the bubbles form and write down his observations based on that. HANSEN: So why was Ready Whip considered one of the historical milestones of physics? Ms. OUELLETTE: Well, I think it was just kind of a fun way to get into the subject of foam. We actually don't know as much as we think we do about bubbles. I mean it's still a very active area of research. We know the basics about surface tension, we know how we make bubbles, we know about surfactants and whipping things up and why it forms that nice yummy foam, but we don't actually know how bubbles closely pack together. We don't necessarily know how they behave under certain extremes and that kind of, understanding those material's properties means that we really can't exploit that material as much as we would like. HANSEN: So who or what is the quantum cat? Ms. OUELLETTE: Quantum cat is that famous Schr\u00f6dinger's cat. It's something that's very frequently misunderstood. I've actually had a couple of people at readings ask how a cat can be both dead and alive at the same time, because they have cats and their cats are very much alive and they sort of miss the point of the thought experiment. He envisioned a box and you take a cat and you put it in the box along with a vial of cyanide and a radioactive element, and as that element decays, if it decays beyond a certain point, it will set off a detector and then it will trigger like a little hammer. It will smash the vial of cyanide, the cyanide will be released, the cat will die. The trick question, of course, is that we have no way of knowing whether the cat is alive or dead until they open the box and look. But until we look, philosophically speaking the cat sort of inhabitants two super-imposed states. And obviously there's no way this actually happens at the macro scale, but the irony is at the subatomic scale that really is how it works, and Schr\u00f6dinger's thought experiment was really designed to demonstrate the absurdity of that, that everything that we seem to know doesn't, it just goes all haywire when you take it down to the subatomic scale. HANSEN: We're really just skimming the surface of this book, which has many chapters and many different things, you know, from Velcro to the physics in the atom's family. Do you see physics at work everywhere now? In other words, you go to the movies, do you find yourself looking at it through kind of a physics' lens? Ms. OUELLETTE: Yes, actually, and it can be a little tiresome for people who are with me. I mean, I can't even look at a sand pile now without going, ooh, self-organized criticality, and then I have to explain what that means. HANSEN: Right, right. But on the other hand, making physics real and emotional and having more to it than just mathematical formulas. Ms. OUELLETTE: Exactly, because math still is not my favorite. I jokingly refer to myself as mathematically enumerate. I did very well in math, but it was never my favorite subject and one of the reasons I think is because I never really saw it connected to the real world. That was another reason I feared physics. I think if I learned it in the context of some of these physics principles with real-world applications, it would've made a huge difference for me and I hope that it's making that difference now, because ultimately it's all about making those vital connections.

Ted Daeschler at the Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia has been fascinated by how those steps can add up, starting with a creature that swims in the sea and ending up with one that walks on land. That transition, in the lineage that ultimately led to humans, happened about 375 million years ago, long before the dinosaurs. To look for creatures during that critical time in evolution, Daeschler and his colleagues dug into ancient rock formations in the extreme North of Canada, Ellesmere Island; they poked around for a few years without finding much. But in 2004, they finally came across fossils that caught their attention in a big way. TED DAESCHLER: We have several individuals. The smallest and best preserved is probably about four feet long. We have the skull and fin of an animal that's significantly bigger, we would estimate at about nine feet long, so these are pretty big fish. HARRIS: And they were unusual in other ways too. DAESCHLER: The eyes were placed high on the head almost like a crocodile. They still had scales covering the body, and they still had fins, which you would look at and say, well, that's a fin. It has the long rods that I'm used to seeing in a fish fin. HARRIS: But this species also had some of the features you'd expect in the earliest four-legged land animals, the tetrapods. For one thing, its head wasn't simply an extension of the body, as you find in a fish. It could pivot from side to side, and the fins had bones that were starting to hint at a hand or a foot. DESCHLER: The fin was doing much more than a fish that's swimming through open water. In fact, it probably wasn't all that good at swimming through open water. HARRIS: Instead, this animal was suited to crawling along on its belly through the shallow waters of a muddy river delta. And Deschler argues, this is just the kind of habitat that created an opportunity for fish to emerge from the sea, not with one giant transformative step, but gradually, in fact, over millions of years. DESCHLER: You don't just swim and you don't just walk on land. There's plenty of ecological space for an animal that did some of each or primarily lived in the water, perhaps on shallow water, using its fins to propel across the bottom or to scoot across a log or perhaps even a mudflat for short distances. PER AHLBERG: I mean, we don't really know, of course. We're looking at dead bones, and we can only say so much about likely lifestyles. HARRIS: Per Ahlberg at Uppsala University in Sweden wasn't involved with this find, but he studies the ancient animals, who evolved into land-dwellers. AHLBERG: There seems a plausible kind of interpretation for the kind of life that this sort of animal might have led. HARRIS: Ahlberg says the news fossil is quite similar to another ancient species found years ago in Europe, but that similarity actually makes it more interesting scientifically, because it shows that the fossils are no fluke, if you pardon the expression, but part of a sequence that ultimately led to the larger terrestrial animals. AHLBERG: And so at a stroke, we now get a much more detailed picture of what our own ancestors looked like at the point when they were just starting to nose out of the water.

Its description is published in Nature and for all its significance and evolution, Deschler is careful not to call it the missing link between fish and our early terrestrial ancestors.

I'm Ira Flatow. In this year of fast food and fad diets, there's always been one recommendation that almost all nutrition, health and diet experts agree on. And that is, eat more fish, salmon, sardines, fish like that, because they're rich in heart-protecting omega 3 fatty acids. But at the same time, just as we've come to embrace that idea, we're warned by the Food and Drug Administration against eating too much fish, mostly the big fish such as tuna, swordfish, and shark, because they may contain high amounts of mercury. And eating too much mercury has been shown to cause neurobiological problems, particularly in fetuses and young children. Remember the Mad Hatter? It was the mercury in those headbands that was the cause. So, what should you do? Is it safe to order that tuna fish sandwich for lunch or that sashimi for dinner? Well, an investigation by the Chicago Tribune last year found that the fish sold in supermarkets throughout Chicago area were contaminated with unsafe levels of mercury. The reporters say they've also found evidence that the government is not doing its job to protect consumers from what they call \u201ca mercury menace. \u201d This hour we're going to talk with a Tribune reporter about his investigation, with a scientist about what is known about the effects of mercury in the body including how much mercury is too much. And if there are unsafe levels of mercury in the fish sold in your supermarket, why are they allowed to sell it? Our number 1-800-989-8255 if you'd like to join in the discussion, 1-800-989-TALK. And, as always, you can surf over to our website at sciencefriday. com. Michael Hawthorne is an environment reporter at the Chicago Tribune in Chicago. He joins us today from the studios of WBEZ in Chicago. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY Michael. Mr. MICHAEL HAWTHORNE (Environment reporter, Chicago Tribune): Thanks Ira, good to be here. FLATOW: You're welcome. Gary Meyers M. D. Dr. Meyers is a pediatric neurologist and a neonatologist at Strong Memorial Hospital and a professor of neurology, of pediatrics, and of environmental medicine at the Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry in Rochester, New York. He joins us by phone from his office there. Welcome to the program Dr. Meyers. Dr. GARY MEYERS (Pediatric neurologist and neonatologist, Strong Memorial Hospital, Rochester, New York): Thank you. FLATOW: Michael Hawthorne, let me begin with you. Your paper, the Chicago Tribune, conducted and investigation. And it was really interesting. The opening article took us back over 30 years to a can of tuna fish. Mr. HAWTHORNE: Well, initially, we looked back at what the government had and had not done over the past several decades. And about 30 years ago, there was a researcher in Upstate New York and he was testing fish for contaminants at a stream, and one of his students said well, what about tuna. And the guy scratched his head, said you know, I don't know. And so he went to a store and bought a can of tuna fish and found very high levels of mercury in it. In fact, at the time, much higher, double what the federal government at that time, at least, considered to be a safe level of mercury in fish. And as a result of that, the federal government pulled about 12 million tins of tuna fish off the shelves. They later told Americans to stop eating swordfish altogether. And then it just all went away. It just all went away. And over time, we found that every now and then someone, a researcher or two, will take a look at this. And various other researchers have been looking at this for quite some time. And what has happened is the science in many ways has changed, but government policy has not changed with it. FLATOW: What do you mean the science has changed? Mr. HAWTHORNE: Well, the science has gotten better. At least from what we've reviewed and what the National Academy of Scientists determined in 2000 was that it takes much lower levels of mercury to cause harm than previously thought. The government standard though, for what can be \u201clegally sold in a supermarket,\u201d hasn't changed since 1979. And in fact, that level was set after the government went to court. The swordfish industry, the seafood industry in general, sued the government, said that they did not have the authority to order fish off the shelves because they were contaminated with mercury. The government lost and, even though the judge in that case, in an appellate court in that case, found that if the science did change then perhaps their ruling would change, the government never bothered to go back and redo that. And so they set this level, and if you look at the federal register filing, which we did, among the many reasons that they gave for this, the scientific reason they gave was they looked at some of the research at the time and, basing it on a 150 pound man, not a woman or a child, they said, you know, well, people don't eat as much fish as people thought before, so therefore, there's really not a risk. And then at the same time they said, you know what, if we doubled the acceptable amount of mercury in fish, you know what will happen? There will be underused fisheries that will be used, other types of seafood will be fished, you know, deeper places in the ocean where these large predator fish are. Those fish will be able to legally be sold in this country. And in fact, then they also said that consumer confidence in seafood in general would increase. And whether or not that had something to do with it, you know, there were a lot of other things going on, but as a result of that, or after that happened, you know, seafood consumption in this country went up quite a bit. FLATOW: Mm hmm. Dr. Meyers, you know mercury's a toxin, you've studied the question for more than 15 years, really studied the question and its effects on children. Tell us about your study. Dr. MEYERS: Well, it goes back quite some time. We actually started, the group here in Rochester, first began studying mercury, Dr. Clarkson was studying it some 50 years ago. And we got into looking at methyl mercury following the epidemic that occurred in Iraq in 1971 and '72. And when we went to Iraq, Dr. David Marsh and I went on numerous occasions, and examined children who had been exposed and who had not been exposed to mercury during that epidemic, including some children who had been poisoned at the time. And when we looked at all of our data, what it pointed to was that perhaps, hair levels, and mercury is generally measured in hair, as low as ten parts per million might possibly be associated with adverse effects in child development. The only issue was that nobody ate fish in Iraq. So, we felt a responsibility to start looking at actual populations of people who consumed fish to see if that, in fact, was the case. And that led to our studies in the Seychelles. Those are now in their about 20th year. We have been looking at this issue very closely over that period of time. We've now examined over 2,000 people in the Seychelles. The Seychelles is an interesting place because we went there because people consume large amounts of fish. You know, here in the United States, most people, if they have fish once or twice a week, it's a little bit unusual. But in the Seychelles, people consume fish every day. And when we first enrolled our cohort of over 700 children, what we refer to as the main cohort, the women reported to us that they were eating fish 12 times every week. So they had fish with meals on 12 occasions every week. That's almost 50 times a month, which is about, at least, ten times what is commonly seen here in the United States. In addition, their hair levels averaged almost seven parts per million, which is about ten times higher than the average here in the United States, as well. So we. . . FLATOW: So they were eating, getting a lot of mercury is what you're saying. Dr. MEYERS: Well, they were eating a lot of fish and their mercury levels were higher than what is here in the United States. And so, we set up a longitudinal study and have been following this cohort of over 700 children for the past 15 years. And actually, we're just in the process of evaluating these children again. We've examined them on six occasions previously with extensive batteries of neurological, psychological, behavioral, and other kinds of tests. We've tried to use almost every test that's been used in any other study of mercury, or other toxins, actually. And, over that period of time, we've looked at a variety of things. We have very good data. The cohort has been extremely well characterized in a variety of different ways. And we know exactly what their prenatal exposure was to mercury, how much they got. FLATOW: And what did you find? Dr. MEYERS: Well, we've looked at about 60 different endpoints and what we've found so far is we've found an association between mercury and children's developmental endpoints. Four times out of 60 different endpoints. . . FLATOW: I'm not sure we understand. Can you try to boil it down a little more lay language? Dr. MEYERS: Let me try to explain a little. What is done is the children are given a variety of tests, things like IQ tests, so that you can give an IQ test and you end up with a variety of what are called endpoints when you do that. One endpoint might be your total IQ score. Another might be your IQ score based on your verbal performance during that test. Another might be your IQ score based on your motor skills during that test. So, there are a variety of tests like this. And the value that one ends up with is simply called an endpoint. And then what's done is one looks at the relationship between And then what's done is one looks at the relationship between prenatal mercury exposure and that endpoint to see if there is an association. In other words, if the children who have higher levels of exposure do better or worse on that test. So, we've now looked at over 60 end points in Seychelles, what are referred to as primary end points. And what we found is four associations with mercury. One of those was adverse. That is, the children did more poorly as their mercury levels increased. This was a motor task actually. We found two that have been beneficial. That is, as the mercury levels went up, the children did better in their performance. And one that we found difficult to interpret was that boys were less active as their mercury went up slightly. We weren't sure if that was a beneficial affect or an adverse affect. So, we found these four associations. Now, one normally expects to find about one out of every 20 just by chance. So, our conclusion so far is that we've found no consistent evidence of any adverse effects from mercury exposure from fish consumption at the levels that are taking in Seychelles. FLATOW: Is there not a study from Harvard's Farrow Island study showing that high levels of mercury passed from mother to child in utero produced irreversible impairments to specific brain functions in children. Dr. MYERS: Well, that's an interesting study, the one that was done in the Farrow. It's really quite an excellent study. It's an observation epidemiological  study where one simply examines children. And they did pretty much the same thing that we did in terms of evaluating the children. There are some differences though, and one of the differences was that the exposure in the Farrows was different than an exposure in Seychelles. In Seychelles, the women eat fish. In the Farrows, women eat fish, and they also eat whale meat. And whale meat actually has quite high levels of mercury and it's eaten episodically so that periodically one gets a bolis, if you will, of mercury from consuming whale meat. And whale also has another difference from just straight fish in that there are multiple other contaminants that are present in whales. PCBs being the most common one, but in addition there's cadmium and dioxins and a variety of other things. And they did report that there was some associations between the end points and mercury. Now, you need to understand when you do these studies that they're rather complex to do. And you have to factor out a variety of other things when you try to reach conclusions. So you have to look at all the other things that affect child development as well in order to say that whatever you're finding is related to the mercury. FLATOW: Hmm. Michael Hawthorne when you, let me just remind everybody that this is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. When you went into the supermarkets and studied the mercury content of the fish there, were you surprised by how high the levels were? Mr. HAWTHORNE: Well, in some cases, no, but in some cases, yes. We knew, for example, that sword fish likely would be high. What we were surprised about is that we found so many samples of sword fish at randomly selected supermarkets that were above what the government would consider to be legal, and yet it's still being sold. There's no warning label required on this or anything else like that. And in fact, the Food and Drug Administration, although they say in their documentation and other things like that, that any fish over that certain limit, that they will take legal action to prevent its sale, they don't do that, and they acknowledge that they don't do that, and so they've decided that instead they will warn women and children especially about certain types of fish. FLATOW: So are they, so they in effect ignoring the law by not. . . Mr. HAWTHORNE: Well, it's not necessarily law. It's a rule and they call it an action level. That's the way they describe it but the way they define an action level is anything above that limit. And they have these action levels for many different types of contaminants, not just in fish, but in other things as well. They define an action level as anything above that level, they will take legal action to remove this product, this food stuff, whatever, off of the market. FLATOW: Mm hmm. We actually asked someone, we asked the FDA to send someone as spokesperson to come on the program, and they decided they would rather not come on SCIENCE FRIDAY. So, what conclusion did you reach about the safety of the fish that people are eating in the supermarkets? Can you tell from looking at it whether it's got high levels of mercury or not? Mr. HAWTHORNE: You couldn't tell at all. In fact, you could go to a supermarket display case, and because there's wide variability in many different types of fish, even in tuna, even in swordfish. We found relatively low levels of mercury in some swordfish. It depends generally on the size and age and diet of the fish. And because many of these fish, especially large predator fish like tuna, are traveling throughout the oceans, it's really difficult to determine, you know, when they're going to be in some kind of part of the ocean where their diet will be high in mercury. And so, you could have, for example, two pieces of tuna in a supermarket display case, the one could be very high in mercury, the one could be relatively low. And there's no way to know whether that's the case. And so, it's sort of a, it's like a little bit of a grocery store roulette there with that. And there is a number of scientists. I know Dr. Myers has been working on this study for a long time. But there are a number of other scientists that believe that these spikes in mercury, if a woman consumes that during pregnancy, that that could have some kind of adverse affect on the development of the fetus and then the child later in life. And what ended up happening was in 2000 partially at the urging of the Food and Drug Administration, the National Academy of Sciences took a look at this, and they essentially endorsed a reference dose, a safe level of exposure in a person that was developed by the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency. Now, here's another government agency that did the work, but they don't have regulatory authority over commercial fish. So you and I could, for example, go to Lake Erie, and we would, let's say, we're going to go Walleye fishing, and we could catch that Walleye. When we got our fishing license, we would be handed an advisory by whatever state is surrounding there, saying to limit your intake of Walleye because it tends to be high in mercury. FLATOW: Michael, hold on to that cause we have to take a break and we'll come back and pick up that thought. Talk lots more about mercury in fish and take your phone calls about it. So, stay with us we'll be right back after this short break. I'm Ira Flatow. This is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. (Soundbite of music) FLATOW: You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow. We're talking this hour about mercury in fish with my guests, Dr. Gary Myers, Michael Hawthorne, a report, an environmental reporter, Chicago Tribune, Dr. Myers is a pediatric neurologist and neonatologist at Strong Memorial Hospital and professor of neurology of pediatrics, and environmental medicine, University of Rochester school of Medicine and Dentistry, Rochester, New York. Our number 1-800-989-8255. Michael, you could finish your thought if you want. If you want to recap? Mr. HAWTHORNE: Right. Ira essentially what I was talking about there was there are conflicting advice from the government. You have one agency, the Food and Drug Administration, that actually has legal authority over commercial seafood. You have another agency, the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency, that does the science because they're basically looking out for the fresh water streams and lakes here in the United States. They've taken a look at the more recent science on mercury exposure, and they came up with a level that was later in 2000, endorsed by the National Academy of Sciences. There was a group that the FDA got together to look at this that led to their advisory to pregnant women and children. But their underlying science, their underlying policy, is essentially not changed based on the science. FLATOW: Dr. Myers go ahead. Dr. MYERS: Each of these reference doses is an interesting one because the EPA's reference dose is, of course, the lowest reference dose of any governmental agency around. There are two other agencies. One the FDA, which Michael was just talking about, who actually has a dose similar to the RFD, which is called the ADI, which is actually somewhat higher than the EPA's reference dose. And then the other agency, which has a lot of authority in this area, is the agency for toxic substances and disease registry, which is part of the CDC in Atlanta. And they are actually the agency that is responsible for looking at toxins, and they publish a series of books. They have about 150 toxins that they publish regularly upon, for they are responsible for revealing the science behind things. FLATOW: Well, let's talk about the science behind this. How much do we know? It seems puzzling from what you're -- what your study has shown with the Seychelles, that we really don't know a lot about how mercury affects behavior in the brain. Dr. MYERS: Well, we know lots about how mercury affects behavior in the brain. . . FLATOW: But you've got a result where people eating more mercury were doing better. Dr. MYERS: Well, this is at very low levels. You know, what we know about mercury, most of what we know about mercury poisoning, prenatally, before birth, comes from poisoning episodes. There have been fewer than a hundred poisoning episodes that have taken place anywhere in the world. And the majority of those have been from the consumption of grain. It use to be common around the world to treat seed grain. The farmers would treat seed grain methyl mercury, and occasionally people would eat it, and there have been a number of episodes that have been related to that. The only case of methyl mercury poisoning that's ever occurred in the United States, or  been reported in the medical literature at least, occurred in that manner, eating seed grain. FLATOW: So, why would these children do better with more mercury? Dr. MYERS: Well, they don't do better from the mercury. It's clear that mercury is a toxin. FLATOW: Well, you just reported that these two groups, or four groups, unless I misunderstood you. Dr. MYERS: What I said was that they did better on some of the tests. FLATOW: Right. So why would they do better with having more mercury on some of the tests? Dr. MYERS: Well, one possibility is that there are lots of beneficial nutrients in fish, and that the mercury is simply a marker for eating more fish. And they're getting more beneficial nutrients. Mr. HAWTHORNE: Ira, I think there's another study at Harvard that was published last year. Not the one that you were referencing to the Farrow Islands. But this was folks from the Harvard School of Public Health took a look at women in the Boston area, and essentially they did, it was another one of these tests to basically look at cognition, and what they found was that women who ate a lot of fish, their children tended to do better on that test. But if the mothers had higher levels of mercury in their bodies, the children tended to do worse on the tests. And so the conclusion that the researchers had in that case was, yes, fish, in general, is good for you but if fish are high in mercury, that could offset the mental health benefits, the other benefits of eating fish. And so, essentially what people are saying is, yeah, go ahead and eat fish, but shouldn't we know more about which types of fish are safer to eat, and which types of fish we should either avoid or eat very sparingly. Dr. MYERS: There's been a lot of, sort of, public relations that's gone on around mercury and its become really quite a political sort of an issue. And, you know, when one looks for cases of children, for instance, who've had learning disorders or other things related to mercury, it's impossible to find them in the literature. There are no proven cases of that. There are fewer than a 100 cases of mercury poisoning prenatally that have ever been described. So, what people are basing these opinions on are these large epidemiological studies that are very difficult to carry out and open to wide variations in interpretation. The Harvard study that Michael's talking about was just slightly over 100 children, and there were some design issues that were very concerning about that particular study. I think that the big studies, the Farrows study, and the Seychelle studies, looking at large numbers of children, are what is required to try to get to the bottom of this problem. Mr. HAWTHORNE: Ira, I wonder if I could just. . . FLATOW: Let me just ask a question first. Are you saying that in the Pharoah and the Seychelle studies they did not find any increased incidences of ADHD, or any other kinds of developmental. . . Dr. MEYERS: Well, you have to look at what was actually reported from the Farrows. What was reported as an adverse consequence was a statistically significant difference on a test of, one of the tests was a test called finger tapping. And if you look at the data, what you see when the data is plotted is this huge cloud of points. And somebody draws a line through that based on statistical analysis, and it either goes up, or down, or stays flat. In the case of finger tapping, in the Farrows, where they did find a significant association, it amounted to roughly one finger tap in 15 seconds, between those children who had the higher exposure and those who had the lower exposure. Now, most people would not define that as a developmental disability, a learning disability, or mental retardation. FLATOW: That's what I'm asking. I mean, there are other issues these days, like we're seeing an increase in ADD, ADHD, other kinds of childhood disorders. Were these sort of things tested, or tried to be teased out, from the Farrows or the Seychelles? Dr. MYERS: They were. FLATOW: And they were not found? Dr. MYERS: And they were not found. FLATOW: Not found. Okay. Dr. MYERS: No, in fact, if one looks at the Farrows children, the Farrows researchers have been to Seychelles, and we've been to Farrows, and all the children are healthy. We are looking at small differences statistically when we try to identify these relationships. Mr. HAWTHORNE: I think, Ira. . . FLATOW: Gary, go ahead. Dr. MYERS: Go ahead. Go ahead. . . FLATOW: Oh, Michael, go ahead. I'm sorry. Mr. HAWTHORNE: No, I'm sorry. I think, you know, as a reporter, as a journalist, when we try to make sense of this, I mean, science tends to be kind of noisy. And, where do you go? So, oftentimes what we'll look to, and what the scientific looks to, and what the policy committee tends to look to, meaning the government and lawmakers, is, you know, let's have the National Academy take a look at this. And again, I'm sorry to sound like a broken record here, but when they did take a look at this in 2000, I mean, one of the conclusions that they made was that, based on their look at all of the studies that had been done to that point, at that point, that the risk to women who consumed large amounts of seafood during their pregnancy is likely, and I'm quoting exactly from their report, is likely to be sufficient to result in an increase in the number of children who have to struggle to keep up in school. That's what they said. And again, they endorse this EPA level, which, as Dr. Myers said, is the lowest amount. But there are a number of scientists out there, including people who were on that panel, that it may not be even low enough. And so, but what ends up happening here, and I think what we were trying to point out in our series, is that, what tends to happen sometimes is when there's all this confusion, you essentially have paralysis. And the government doesn't really do anything. And so while various entities of the government, various people in government, are saying that this can be avoided, and it could be avoided, what they're not doing is giving Americans good advice so they can go to their supermarket and shop for something safely. That's basically what's happening right now. FLATOW: In other words, labels on the food, things like that? Mr. HAWTHORNE: Well, that's what some people would say. Why should you have to go to a very hard to manage government website to find some information, and then when you back out, what the government actually says, and you look at how they come up with some of their advice, they actually acknowledge there, and this is in public records, they actually acknowledge that they based some of their recommendations, not on whether the fish was necessarily safe to eat, but on market share. And should a government agency that's in charge of protecting public health, this is one of the points we make in the series, should that agency be basing something on market share, or should they be basing it on what's safe for public health? Dr. MYERS: I think they should be basing it on what's safe for public health. And I think we all should be basing what we recommend on what's best for children's health. And if consuming fish is good for children's health, then we should be recommending that. If the toxicity of the mercury at higher levels is a problem, then we should recommend that they not consume things that are higher level. But, you know, the brain is a large percentage of fatty acids, and the fatty acids that are present in fish are basically building blocks for children's brains. And it's important that children get these. I mean, recently people have been arguing about, and recommending adding DEHA, which is one of the, long-chain fatty acids, to baby's formulas for this very reason. So, I think that we have to. . . Mr. HAWTHORNE: But you'll notice that some fish, right, I mean, some fish are not high in. . . Dr. MYERS: That's true. Mr. HAWTHORNE: . . . in these various acids in some of the fish, you know, including some types of tuna. Dr. MYERS: I think we need to be careful that whatever we do is best for the children's health. And at the moment, you know, the things that have been shown clearly, scientifically, to be beneficial to children's health are omega-3 fatty acids. And the risk of the toxicity is a theoretical risk, still, at this point in time. FLATOW: But do we know at what level, Dr. Myers, mercury becomes dangerous? We know its toxic, but do we know at what level, if you eat it, it's going to become dangerous? Dr. MYERS: We don't, and that's part of the issue. You know, and one of the interesting things is that the level of exposure in the Farrows, for example, was lower than the level of exposure in the Seychelles. We know at high levels that it's quite toxic. The people who were poisoned in Minamata had exposures of 100 or 200. The fish at Minamata, that the people were eating, had had 50 parts per million of mercury in the flesh. Now that's a hundred times what is the standard for most of the fish in the U. S. FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255 is our number. We're talking about mercury in fish this hour on TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. Michael, how could the government's consumer advisory be strengthened? Do we tell them -- first of all, let me ask do we know where the mercury is coming from? Mr. HAWTHORNE: Well, that's a good question. I mean it's coming. . . FLATOW: Why not stop it at the source, you know? Mr. HAWTHORNE: . . . there's natural sources of mercury in the oceans. Volcanoes and forest fires, and what not, those are all sources of mercury. In the United States, the largest man-made source of mercury pollution is coal fired power plants, and this has been a huge debate in Washington and across the country, because there are, for the first time, rules being proposed to limit emissions of mercury from power plants. That's one source. It's a global cycle, but the courts have ruled, and the government has decided, that there's enough of it that is from man-made sources that it's getting into fish, its contaminating fish, and therefore, you know, at least at one point in time, what we found is the government was very aggressive about going after this. And then, for various reasons they decided not to. And instead, they essentially leave it up to you and me to figure out which fish are safe to eat. FLATOW: Well, how do we do that? What do you think the government should be doing more of in letting us know? And how can a consumer take action on his or her self? Mr. HAWTHORNE: Well, I think what a lot of people would agree on is that there needs to be a heck of a lot more testing. I mean, we found that the government, for example, had tested four walleye, a very common, popular freshwater fish here in the Midwest. They tested four walleye, about 26 shrimp, in the last 25 years. Other types of fish, they've tested very little types of those fish. And so, you really don't know if they have a good idea what the levels are in certain types of fish. When they do test them, essentially, their own tests can show that mercury is more pervasive in fish than what they have told the public. And so, that makes it more difficult for consumers to avoid the problem. And really, there's no place that they can go to shop to avoid it. It really comes down to the type of fish you eat. So, if you eat the shorter, smaller lived fish, and some of those fish like salmon and sardines, they tend to be very high in those fatty acids that Dr. Myers was talking about, and low in mercury. Some of the other fish, including some types of tuna, tend to be high in mercury and low in the beneficial fatty acids. And you, but you really, what you have to do is you have to be like a reporter, you have to be like a journalist and you have to go through these somewhat difficult to understand government websites and piece it all together. And I think there are a lot of people in good faith that would say that that's really not the way the government should be doing things. FLATOW: Dr. Myers, last word? Dr. MYERS: Well, I think it's really important for the children's health to keep in mind that the proof, there are proven benefits of omega-3 fatty acids on children's neuro development, and that at this point in time, that the scientific evidence supporting the risks to low-levels that most people here in the U. S. are exposed to, are simply theoretical. FLATOW: Mm hmm. So, you recommend to just go out and eat fish then? Dr. MYERS: Well. I think that one should do everything in moderation. But certainly, children need the long-chained fatty acids that are present in fish. FLATOW: So, if you had children, you just wouldn't care about how much tuna they ate during the week? Dr. MYERS: I would feel very comfortable feeding them tuna. The children in both Seychelles and Farrows are extremely healthy, and in fact the Seychelles lead the Indian Ocean in their athletics. FLATOW: We won't get into the pesticides question. That'll be a different topic, in different fish. I want to thank both of you for taking time to talk with us. Dr. Gary Meyers, pediatric neurologist and neonatalogist at Strong Memorial Hospital and professor of neurology of pediatrics and environmental medicine at the University of Rochester, School of Medicine and Dentistry, in Rochester, New York. Thank you. Michael Hawthorne, environmental reporter at the Chicago Tribune, in Chicago, Illinois, and author of a really interesting series of reports on mercury. You can probably find them on their website at chicagotribune. com. Thank you both for taking time to be with us today.  IRA FLATOW, host:  You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow. In this year of fast food and fad diets, there's always been one recommendation that almost all nutrition, health and diet experts agree on. And that is, eat more fish, salmon, sardines, fish like that, because they're rich in heart-protecting omega 3 fatty acids.  But at the same time, just as we've come to embrace that idea, we're warned by the Food and Drug Administration against eating too much fish, mostly the big fish such as tuna, swordfish, and shark, because they may contain high amounts of mercury. And eating too much mercury has been shown to cause neurobiological problems, particularly in fetuses and young children. Remember the Mad Hatter? It was the mercury in those headbands that was the cause. So, what should you do? Is it safe to order that tuna fish sandwich for lunch or that sashimi for dinner? Well, an investigation by the Chicago Tribune last year found that the fish sold in supermarkets throughout Chicago area were contaminated with unsafe levels of mercury. The reporters say they've also found evidence that the government is not doing its job to protect consumers from what they call \u201ca mercury menace. \u201d  This hour we're going to talk with a Tribune reporter about his investigation, with a scientist about what is known about the effects of mercury in the body including how much mercury is too much. And if there are unsafe levels of mercury in the fish sold in your supermarket, why are they allowed to sell it? Our number 1-800-989-8255 if you'd like to join in the discussion, 1-800-989-TALK. And, as always, you can surf over to our website at sciencefriday. com. Michael Hawthorne is an environment reporter at the Chicago Tribune in Chicago. He joins us today from the studios of WBEZ in Chicago. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY Michael.  Mr. MICHAEL HAWTHORNE (Environment reporter, Chicago Tribune): Thanks Ira, good to be here.  FLATOW: You're welcome. Gary Meyers M. D. Dr. Meyers is a pediatric neurologist and a neonatologist at Strong Memorial Hospital and a professor of neurology, of pediatrics, and of environmental medicine at the Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry in Rochester, New York. He joins us by phone from his office there. Welcome to the program Dr. Meyers.  Dr. GARY MEYERS (Pediatric neurologist and neonatologist, Strong Memorial Hospital, Rochester, New York): Thank you.  FLATOW: Michael Hawthorne, let me begin with you. Your paper, the Chicago Tribune, conducted and investigation. And it was really interesting. The opening article took us back over 30 years to a can of tuna fish.  Mr. HAWTHORNE: Well, initially, we looked back at what the government had and had not done over the past several decades. And about 30 years ago, there was a researcher in Upstate New York and he was testing fish for contaminants at a stream, and one of his students said well, what about tuna. And the guy scratched his head, said you know, I don't know. And so he went to a store and bought a can of tuna fish and found very high levels of mercury in it. In fact, at the time, much higher, double what the federal government at that time, at least, considered to be a safe level of mercury in fish. And as a result of that, the federal government pulled about 12 million tins of tuna fish off the shelves. They later told Americans to stop eating swordfish altogether. And then it just all went away. It just all went away. And over time, we found that every now and then someone, a researcher or two, will take a look at this. And various other researchers have been looking at this for quite some time. And what has happened is the science in many ways has changed, but government policy has not changed with it.  FLATOW: What do you mean the science has changed?  Mr. HAWTHORNE: Well, the science has gotten better. At least from what we've reviewed and what the National Academy of Scientists determined in 2000 was that it takes much lower levels of mercury to cause harm than previously thought. The government standard though, for what can be \u201clegally sold in a supermarket,\u201d hasn't changed since 1979. And in fact, that level was set after the government went to court. The swordfish industry, the seafood industry in general, sued the government, said that they did not have the authority to order fish off the shelves because they were contaminated with mercury. The government lost and, even though the judge in that case, in an appellate court in that case, found that if the science did change then perhaps their ruling would change, the government never bothered to go back and redo that.  And so they set this level, and if you look at the federal register filing, which we did, among the many reasons that they gave for this, the scientific reason they gave was they looked at some of the research at the time and, basing it on a 150 pound man, not a woman or a child, they said, you know, well, people don't eat as much fish as people thought before, so therefore, there's really not a risk. And then at the same time they said, you know what, if we doubled the acceptable amount of mercury in fish, you know what will happen? There will be underused fisheries that will be used, other types of seafood will be fished, you know, deeper places in the ocean where these large predator fish are. Those fish will be able to legally be sold in this country. And in fact, then they also said that consumer confidence in seafood in general would increase. And whether or not that had something to do with it, you know, there were a lot of other things going on, but as a result of that, or after that happened, you know, seafood consumption in this country went up quite a bit.  FLATOW: Mm hmm. Dr. Meyers, you know mercury's a toxin, you've studied the question for more than 15 years, really studied the question and its effects on children. Tell us about your study.  Dr. MEYERS: Well, it goes back quite some time. We actually started, the group here in Rochester, first began studying mercury, Dr. Clarkson was studying it some 50 years ago. And we got into looking at methyl mercury following the epidemic that occurred in Iraq in 1971 and '72. And when we went to Iraq, Dr. David Marsh and I went on numerous occasions, and examined children who had been exposed and who had not been exposed to mercury during that epidemic, including some children who had been poisoned at the time. And when we looked at all of our data, what it pointed to was that perhaps, hair levels, and mercury is generally measured in hair, as low as ten parts per million might possibly be associated with adverse effects in child development.  The only issue was that nobody ate fish in Iraq. So, we felt a responsibility to start looking at actual populations of people who consumed fish to see if that, in fact, was the case. And that led to our studies in the Seychelles. Those are now in their about 20th year. We have been looking at this issue very closely over that period of time. We've now examined over 2,000 people in the Seychelles. The Seychelles is an interesting place because we went there because people consume large amounts of fish. You know, here in the United States, most people, if they have fish once or twice a week, it's a little bit unusual. But in the Seychelles, people consume fish every day.  And when we first enrolled our cohort of over 700 children, what we refer to as the main cohort, the women reported to us that they were eating fish 12 times every week. So they had fish with meals on 12 occasions every week. That's almost 50 times a month, which is about, at least, ten times what is commonly seen here in the United States. In addition, their hair levels averaged almost seven parts per million, which is about ten times higher than the average here in the United States, as well. So we. . .  FLATOW: So they were eating, getting a lot of mercury is what you're saying.  Dr. MEYERS: Well, they were eating a lot of fish and their mercury levels were higher than what is here in the United States. And so, we set up a longitudinal study and have been following this cohort of over 700 children for the past 15 years. And actually, we're just in the process of evaluating these children again. We've examined them on six occasions previously with extensive batteries of neurological, psychological, behavioral, and other kinds of tests. We've tried to use almost every test that's been used in any other study of mercury, or other toxins, actually. And, over that period of time, we've looked at a variety of things. We have very good data. The cohort has been extremely well characterized in a variety of different ways. And we know exactly what their prenatal exposure was to mercury, how much they got.  FLATOW: And what did you find?  Dr. MEYERS: Well, we've looked at about 60 different endpoints and what we've found so far is we've found an association between mercury and children's developmental endpoints. Four times out of 60 different endpoints. . .  FLATOW: I'm not sure we understand. Can you try to boil it down a little more lay language?  Dr. MEYERS: Let me try to explain a little. What is done is the children are given a variety of tests, things like IQ tests, so that you can give an IQ test and you end up with a variety of what are called endpoints when you do that. One endpoint might be your total IQ score. Another might be your IQ score based on your verbal performance during that test. Another might be your IQ score based on your motor skills during that test. So, there are a variety of tests like this. And the value that one ends up with is simply called an endpoint. And then what's done is one looks at the relationship between And then what's done is one looks at the relationship between prenatal mercury exposure and that endpoint to see if there is an association. In other words, if the children who have higher levels of exposure do better or worse on that test. So, we've now looked at over 60 end points in Seychelles, what are referred to as primary end points. And what we found is four associations with mercury. One of those was adverse. That is, the children did more poorly as their mercury levels increased. This was a motor task actually. We found two that have been beneficial. That is, as the mercury levels went up, the children did better in their performance. And one that we found difficult to interpret was that boys were less active as their mercury went up slightly. We weren't sure if that was a beneficial affect or an adverse affect. So, we found these four associations. Now, one normally expects to find about one out of every 20 just by chance. So, our conclusion so far is that we've found no consistent evidence of any adverse effects from mercury exposure from fish consumption at the levels that are taking in Seychelles.  FLATOW: Is there not a study from Harvard's Farrow Island study showing that high levels of mercury passed from mother to child in utero produced irreversible impairments to specific brain functions in children.  Dr. MYERS: Well, that's an interesting study, the one that was done in the Farrow. It's really quite an excellent study. It's an observation epidemiological  study where one simply examines children. And they did pretty much the same thing that we did in terms of evaluating the children. There are some differences though, and one of the differences was that the exposure in the Farrows was different than an exposure in Seychelles. In Seychelles, the women eat fish. In the Farrows, women eat fish, and they also eat whale meat. And whale meat actually has quite high levels of mercury and it's eaten episodically so that periodically one gets a bolis, if you will, of mercury from consuming whale meat. And whale also has another difference from just straight fish in that there are multiple other contaminants that are present in whales. PCBs being the most common one, but in addition there's cadmium and dioxins and a variety of other things. And they did report that there was some associations between the end points and mercury. Now, you need to understand when you do these studies that they're rather complex to do. And you have to factor out a variety of other things when you try to reach conclusions. So you have to look at all the other things that affect child development as well in order to say that whatever you're finding is related to the mercury.  FLATOW: Hmm. Michael Hawthorne when you, let me just remind everybody that this is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. When you went into the supermarkets and studied the mercury content of the fish there, were you surprised by how high the levels were?  Mr. HAWTHORNE: Well, in some cases, no, but in some cases, yes. We knew, for example, that sword fish likely would be high. What we were surprised about is that we found so many samples of sword fish at randomly selected supermarkets that were above what the government would consider to be legal, and yet it's still being sold. There's no warning label required on this or anything else like that. And in fact, the Food and Drug Administration, although they say in their documentation and other things like that, that any fish over that certain limit, that they will take legal action to prevent its sale, they don't do that, and they acknowledge that they don't do that, and so they've decided that instead they will warn women and children especially about certain types of fish.  FLATOW: So are they, so they in effect ignoring the law by not. . .  Mr. HAWTHORNE: Well, it's not necessarily law. It's a rule and they call it an action level. That's the way they describe it but the way they define an action level is anything above that limit. And they have these action levels for many different types of contaminants, not just in fish, but in other things as well. They define an action level as anything above that level, they will take legal action to remove this product, this food stuff, whatever, off of the market.  FLATOW: Mm hmm. We actually asked someone, we asked the FDA to send someone as spokesperson to come on the program, and they decided they would rather not come on SCIENCE FRIDAY. So, what conclusion did you reach about the safety of the fish that people are eating in the supermarkets? Can you tell from looking at it whether it's got high levels of mercury or not?  Mr. HAWTHORNE: You couldn't tell at all. In fact, you could go to a supermarket display case, and because there's wide variability in many different types of fish, even in tuna, even in swordfish. We found relatively low levels of mercury in some swordfish. It depends generally on the size and age and diet of the fish. And because many of these fish, especially large predator fish like tuna, are traveling throughout the oceans, it's really difficult to determine, you know, when they're going to be in some kind of part of the ocean where their diet will be high in mercury. And so, you could have, for example, two pieces of tuna in a supermarket display case, the one could be very high in mercury, the one could be relatively low. And there's no way to know whether that's the case. And so, it's sort of a, it's like a little bit of a grocery store roulette there with that.  And there is a number of scientists. I know Dr. Myers has been working on this study for a long time. But there are a number of other scientists that believe that these spikes in mercury, if a woman consumes that during pregnancy, that that could have some kind of adverse affect on the development of the fetus and then the child later in life. And what ended up happening was in 2000 partially at the urging of the Food and Drug Administration, the National Academy of Sciences took a look at this, and they essentially endorsed a reference dose, a safe level of exposure in a person that was developed by the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency. Now, here's another government agency that did the work, but they don't have regulatory authority over commercial fish. So you and I could, for example, go to Lake Erie, and we would, let's say, we're going to go Walleye fishing, and we could catch that Walleye. When we got our fishing license, we would be handed an advisory by whatever state is surrounding there, saying to limit your intake of Walleye because it tends to be high in mercury.  FLATOW: Michael, hold on to that cause we have to take a break and we'll come back and pick up that thought. Talk lots more about mercury in fish and take your phone calls about it. So, stay with us we'll be right back after this short break. I'm Ira Flatow. This is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.  (Soundbite of music)  FLATOW: You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow. We're talking this hour about mercury in fish with my guests, Dr. Gary Myers, Michael Hawthorne, a report, an environmental reporter, Chicago Tribune, Dr. Myers is a pediatric neurologist and neonatologist at Strong Memorial Hospital and professor of neurology of pediatrics, and environmental medicine, University of Rochester school of Medicine and Dentistry, Rochester, New York. Our number 1-800-989-8255. Michael, you could finish your thought if you want. If you want to recap?  Mr. HAWTHORNE: Right. Ira essentially what I was talking about there was there are conflicting advice from the government. You have one agency, the Food and Drug Administration, that actually has legal authority over commercial seafood. You have another agency, the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency, that does the science because they're basically looking out for the fresh water streams and lakes here in the United States. They've taken a look at the more recent science on mercury exposure, and they came up with a level that was later in 2000, endorsed by the National Academy of Sciences. There was a group that the FDA got together to look at this that led to their advisory to pregnant women and children. But their underlying science, their underlying policy, is essentially not changed based on the science.  FLATOW: Dr. Myers go ahead.  Dr. MYERS: Each of these reference doses is an interesting one because the EPA's reference dose is, of course, the lowest reference dose of any governmental agency around. There are two other agencies. One the FDA, which Michael was just talking about, who actually has a dose similar to the RFD, which is called the ADI, which is actually somewhat higher than the EPA's reference dose. And then the other agency, which has a lot of authority in this area, is the agency for toxic substances and disease registry, which is part of the CDC in Atlanta. And they are actually the agency that is responsible for looking at toxins, and they publish a series of books. They have about 150 toxins that they publish regularly upon, for they are responsible for revealing the science behind things.  FLATOW: Well, let's talk about the science behind this. How much do we know? It seems puzzling from what you're -- what your study has shown with the Seychelles, that we really don't know a lot about how mercury affects behavior in the brain.  Dr. MYERS: Well, we know lots about how mercury affects behavior in the brain. . .  FLATOW: But you've got a result where people eating more mercury were doing better.  Dr. MYERS: Well, this is at very low levels. You know, what we know about mercury, most of what we know about mercury poisoning, prenatally, before birth, comes from poisoning episodes. There have been fewer than a hundred poisoning episodes that have taken place anywhere in the world. And the majority of those have been from the consumption of grain. It use to be common around the world to treat seed grain. The farmers would treat seed grain methyl mercury, and occasionally people would eat it, and there have been a number of episodes that have been related to that. The only case of methyl mercury poisoning that's ever occurred in the United States, or  been reported in the medical literature at least, occurred in that manner, eating seed grain.  FLATOW: So, why would these children do better with more mercury?  Dr. MYERS: Well, they don't do better from the mercury. It's clear that mercury is a toxin.  FLATOW: Well, you just reported that these two groups, or four groups, unless I misunderstood you.  Dr. MYERS: What I said was that they did better on some of the tests.  FLATOW: Right. So why would they do better with having more mercury on some of the tests?  Dr. MYERS: Well, one possibility is that there are lots of beneficial nutrients in fish, and that the mercury is simply a marker for eating more fish. And they're getting more beneficial nutrients.  Mr. HAWTHORNE: Ira, I think there's another study at Harvard that was published last year. Not the one that you were referencing to the Farrow Islands. But this was folks from the Harvard School of Public Health took a look at women in the Boston area, and essentially they did, it was another one of these tests to basically look at cognition, and what they found was that women who ate a lot of fish, their children tended to do better on that test. But if the mothers had higher levels of mercury in their bodies, the children tended to do worse on the tests. And so the conclusion that the researchers had in that case was, yes, fish, in general, is good for you but if fish are high in mercury, that could offset the mental health benefits, the other benefits of eating fish. And so, essentially what people are saying is, yeah, go ahead and eat fish, but shouldn't we know more about which types of fish are safer to eat, and which types of fish we should either avoid or eat very sparingly.  Dr. MYERS: There's been a lot of, sort of, public relations that's gone on around mercury and its become really quite a political sort of an issue. And, you know, when one looks for cases of children, for instance, who've had learning disorders or other things related to mercury, it's impossible to find them in the literature. There are no proven cases of that. There are fewer than a 100 cases of mercury poisoning prenatally that have ever been described. So, what people are basing these opinions on are these large epidemiological studies that are very difficult to carry out and open to wide variations in interpretation. The Harvard study that Michael's talking about was just slightly over 100 children, and there were some design issues that were very concerning about that particular study. I think that the big studies, the Farrows study, and the Seychelle studies, looking at large numbers of children, are what is required to try to get to the bottom of this problem.  Mr. HAWTHORNE: Ira, I wonder if I could just. . .  FLATOW: Let me just ask a question first. Are you saying that in the Pharoah and the Seychelle studies they did not find any increased incidences of ADHD, or any other kinds of developmental. . .  Dr. MEYERS: Well, you have to look at what was actually reported from the Farrows. What was reported as an adverse consequence was a statistically significant difference on a test of, one of the tests was a test called finger tapping. And if you look at the data, what you see when the data is plotted is this huge cloud of points. And somebody draws a line through that based on statistical analysis, and it either goes up, or down, or stays flat. In the case of finger tapping, in the Farrows, where they did find a significant association, it amounted to roughly one finger tap in 15 seconds, between those children who had the higher exposure and those who had the lower exposure. Now, most people would not define that as a developmental disability, a learning disability, or mental retardation.  FLATOW: That's what I'm asking. I mean, there are other issues these days, like we're seeing an increase in ADD, ADHD, other kinds of childhood disorders. Were these sort of things tested, or tried to be teased out, from the Farrows or the Seychelles?  Dr. MYERS: They were.  FLATOW: And they were not found?  Dr. MYERS: And they were not found.  FLATOW: Not found. Okay.  Dr. MYERS: No, in fact, if one looks at the Farrows children, the Farrows researchers have been to Seychelles, and we've been to Farrows, and all the children are healthy. We are looking at small differences statistically when we try to identify these relationships.  Mr. HAWTHORNE: I think, Ira. . .  FLATOW: Gary, go ahead.  Dr. MYERS: Go ahead. Go ahead. . .  FLATOW: Oh, Michael, go ahead. I'm sorry.  Mr. HAWTHORNE: No, I'm sorry. I think, you know, as a reporter, as a journalist, when we try to make sense of this, I mean, science tends to be kind of noisy. And, where do you go? So, oftentimes what we'll look to, and what the scientific looks to, and what the policy committee tends to look to, meaning the government and lawmakers, is, you know, let's have the National Academy take a look at this. And again, I'm sorry to sound like a broken record here, but when they did take a look at this in 2000, I mean, one of the conclusions that they made was that, based on their look at all of the studies that had been done to that point, at that point, that the risk to women who consumed large amounts of seafood during their pregnancy is likely, and I'm quoting exactly from their report, is likely to be sufficient to result in an increase in the number of children who have to struggle to keep up in school. That's what they said.  And again, they endorse this EPA level, which, as Dr. Myers said, is the lowest amount. But there are a number of scientists out there, including people who were on that panel, that it may not be even low enough. And so, but what ends up happening here, and I think what we were trying to point out in our series, is that, what tends to happen sometimes is when there's all this confusion, you essentially have paralysis. And the government doesn't really do anything. And so while various entities of the government, various people in government, are saying that this can be avoided, and it could be avoided, what they're not doing is giving Americans good advice so they can go to their supermarket and shop for something safely. That's basically what's happening right now.  FLATOW: In other words, labels on the food, things like that?  Mr. HAWTHORNE: Well, that's what some people would say. Why should you have to go to a very hard to manage government website to find some information, and then when you back out, what the government actually says, and you look at how they come up with some of their advice, they actually acknowledge there, and this is in public records, they actually acknowledge that they based some of their recommendations, not on whether the fish was necessarily safe to eat, but on market share. And should a government agency that's in charge of protecting public health, this is one of the points we make in the series, should that agency be basing something on market share, or should they be basing it on what's safe for public health?  Dr. MYERS: I think they should be basing it on what's safe for public health. And I think we all should be basing what we recommend on what's best for children's health. And if consuming fish is good for children's health, then we should be recommending that. If the toxicity of the mercury at higher levels is a problem, then we should recommend that they not consume things that are higher level. But, you know, the brain is a large percentage of fatty acids, and the fatty acids that are present in fish are basically building blocks for children's brains. And it's important that children get these. I mean, recently people have been arguing about, and recommending adding DEHA, which is one of the, long-chain fatty acids, to baby's formulas for this very reason. So, I think that we have to. . .  Mr. HAWTHORNE: But you'll notice that some fish, right, I mean, some fish are not high in. . .  Dr. MYERS: That's true.  Mr. HAWTHORNE: . . . in these various acids in some of the fish, you know, including some types of tuna.  Dr. MYERS: I think we need to be careful that whatever we do is best for the children's health. And at the moment, you know, the things that have been shown clearly, scientifically, to be beneficial to children's health are omega-3 fatty acids. And the risk of the toxicity is a theoretical risk, still, at this point in time.  FLATOW: But do we know at what level, Dr. Myers, mercury becomes dangerous? We know its toxic, but do we know at what level, if you eat it, it's going to become dangerous?  Dr. MYERS: We don't, and that's part of the issue. You know, and one of the interesting things is that the level of exposure in the Farrows, for example, was lower than the level of exposure in the Seychelles. We know at high levels that it's quite toxic. The people who were poisoned in Minamata had exposures of 100 or 200. The fish at Minamata, that the people were eating, had had 50 parts per million of mercury in the flesh. Now that's a hundred times what is the standard for most of the fish in the U. S.  FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255 is our number. We're talking about mercury in fish this hour on TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. Michael, how could the government's consumer advisory be strengthened? Do we tell them -- first of all, let me ask do we know where the mercury is coming from?  Mr. HAWTHORNE: Well, that's a good question. I mean it's coming. . .  FLATOW: Why not stop it at the source, you know?  Mr. HAWTHORNE: . . . there's natural sources of mercury in the oceans. Volcanoes and forest fires, and what not, those are all sources of mercury. In the United States, the largest man-made source of mercury pollution is coal fired power plants, and this has been a huge debate in Washington and across the country, because there are, for the first time, rules being proposed to limit emissions of mercury from power plants. That's one source. It's a global cycle, but the courts have ruled, and the government has decided, that there's enough of it that is from man-made sources that it's getting into fish, its contaminating fish, and therefore, you know, at least at one point in time, what we found is the government was very aggressive about going after this. And then, for various reasons they decided not to. And instead, they essentially leave it up to you and me to figure out which fish are safe to eat.  FLATOW: Well, how do we do that? What do you think the government should be doing more of in letting us know? And how can a consumer take action on his or her self?  Mr. HAWTHORNE: Well, I think what a lot of people would agree on is that there needs to be a heck of a lot more testing. I mean, we found that the government, for example, had tested four walleye, a very common, popular freshwater fish here in the Midwest. They tested four walleye, about 26 shrimp, in the last 25 years. Other types of fish, they've tested very little types of those fish. And so, you really don't know if they have a good idea what the levels are in certain types of fish. When they do test them, essentially, their own tests can show that mercury is more pervasive in fish than what they have told the public. And so, that makes it more difficult for consumers to avoid the problem. And really, there's no place that they can go to shop to avoid it. It really comes down to the type of fish you eat. So, if you eat the shorter, smaller lived fish, and some of those fish like salmon and sardines, they tend to be very high in those fatty acids that Dr. Myers was talking about, and low in mercury. Some of the other fish, including some types of tuna, tend to be high in mercury and low in the beneficial fatty acids. And you, but you really, what you have to do is you have to be like a reporter, you have to be like a journalist and you have to go through these somewhat difficult to understand government websites and piece it all together. And I think there are a lot of people in good faith that would say that that's really not the way the government should be doing things.  FLATOW: Dr. Myers, last word?  Dr. MYERS: Well, I think it's really important for the children's health to keep in mind that the proof, there are proven benefits of omega-3 fatty acids on children's neuro development, and that at this point in time, that the scientific evidence supporting the risks to low-levels that most people here in the U. S. are exposed to, are simply theoretical.  FLATOW: Mm hmm. So, you recommend to just go out and eat fish then?  Dr. MYERS: Well. I think that one should do everything in moderation. But certainly, children need the long-chained fatty acids that are present in fish.  FLATOW: So, if you had children, you just wouldn't care about how much tuna they ate during the week?  Dr. MYERS: I would feel very comfortable feeding them tuna. The children in both Seychelles and Farrows are extremely healthy, and in fact the Seychelles lead the Indian Ocean in their athletics.  FLATOW: We won't get into the pesticides question. That'll be a different topic, in different fish. I want to thank both of you for taking time to talk with us.

Before you sit down to your next meal, I want you to take a minute to consider what's on your plate. I mean, really consider where did the food come from and don't say the grocery store. Do you really know anything about the origins of your meal? Yeah, sure, the steak comes from a cow, the potato comes from a field, but a cow raised on what? A potato field growing where? How many miles did it travel to get to you? And something I'll bet you haven't considered, how many barrels of oil did it take to make the meal you are about to eat? Well my next guest has pondered all of these questions about what we eat, where it comes from. He has gathered his findings in a new book called THE OMNIVORE'S DILEMMA. And I guarantee that after reading this book, you won't think of your food in the same way again, especially the section on corn, where he says that just about everything around us, everything has corn connected to it. And not just your food we're talking about. Well, let him talk about it. My next guest is Michael Pollan, author of THE OMNIVORE'S DILEMMA: A NATURAL HISTORY OF FOUR MEALS. He's contributing writer to The New York Times Magazine, night professor of journalism at the University of California Berkeley. He's here in our New York studios. Welcome back to SCIENCE FRIDAY. Mr. MICHAEL POLLAN (University of California Berkeley): Thank you, Ira. Good to be back. FLATOW: That's pretty, pretty damning talk to talk about our obsession with food. And, not in a good way. Why, why do you say that? Mr. POLLAN: Well, I think we do have an eating disorder. You know, eating disorders don't just afflict teenaged girls. A whole culture can have one when it falls into a deep anxiety and confusion about what to eat. You know, this is one of the most basic things any animal does, is find dinner for itself. And most animals know exactly how to go about it. And we don't any more. I think we did for a long time. FLATOW: When did we stop? Mr. POLLAN: Well, the basic, the omnivore's dilemma, that idea, which is a term used by some anthropologists and psychologists to describe the predicament of any species that can eat a great many things in nature and needs to eat a great many different things. We need about 50 different kinds of molecules and atoms, basically, to survive. So, if you have such broad needs, you need, you have a lot of anxiety about food to begin with, because, is that mushroom safe? Is that one dangerous? What about that berry? Can I eat that animal? Is it too old? So a lot of kind of cognitive space and time must be applied to this eating problem. If you are a generalist. If you are a specialist eater, say you are a koala bear, if it looks and smells like a eucalyptus leaf, it's lunch. And if it doesn't, it's something else. It's the world. And you know cows are the same way with grass. But if you're a generalist, like us, the rats, the cockroaches, we have some kind of unsavory company in this kind of eater, you need a system to figure this out. You need to divide the world into what's okay to eat, what's not okay to eat. We have prodigious powers of memory and recognition. We can remember that that mushroom made us sick last week, so don't eat it. But we have something even better, which is a culture. Culture is a fancy word for what your mom tells you it's ok to eat, basically. And so we put a name on that mushroom. We call it the death cap. And that very helpfully tells us --FLATOW: Tells us, don't eat. Just stay away. Mr. POLLAN: And we have developed a set of taboos, cuisines, manners at the table, you know, the order in which to eat things, how much to eat, and this is our culture of food. And it has held steady for thousands and thousands of years, but it's broken down. And I think I would date it to about 50 years ago. FLATOW: All right, we'll come back and tease it out here. Where it has broken down. Why you say about 50 years ago. Talking with Michael Pollan, the author of THE OMNIVORE'S DILEMMA: A NATURAL HISTORY OF FOUR MEALS. We'll take your calls: 1-800-989-8255. Stay with us, we'll be right back. I'm Ira Flatow, this is TALK OF THE NATION's Science Friday, from NPR News. You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION's Science Friday. I'm Ira Flatow. Talking with Michael Pollan, author of THE OMNIVORE'S DILEMMA: A NATURAL HISTORY OF FOUR MEALS. And you were talking about when our things broke down in how we eat. You said it was about 50 years ago. What happened? Mr. POLLAN: Yeah, I guess I would say the breakdown really begins with the industrialization of our food supply. You, you know, if you think about what we eat, what we eat has changed more in the last 50 years probably than in the last 5,000. We have all these new food products that your great-grandmother would not recognize as food. And arguably, they are not food. They're food products. But, you know, if you gave her Gogurt or a Pop-Tart, she wouldn't know what to do with it. So we've had this explosion of new products, 15,000 new ones every year. We've also had marketing to each member of the family, which tends to break down the mother's and father's authority over what the family eats. So you've got parents in competition with food marketers, essentially, to completely throw up into the air what is a good meal? What should be you eating? Should you be eating fats or carbs? And we have scientists. I think scientists are actually a big part of the problem when it comes to food. We get a lot of, we hear a lot of very conflicting advice. We get, you know, new discoveries every few years, whether we should worry about carbs or fats or transfats or omega 3s. And I think that this kind of cacophony of dietary advice has really thrown us off our game, and add to that the fact that in America, we've never had a very strong food culture, the way the French or the Italians do, that really steadies people's eating habits. FLATOW: Right. They would never, they look at our processed food like we're nutty. Mr. POLLAN: They do, and, although gradually our way of eating, I'm sad to say --FLATOW: Is making its way --Mr. POLLAN: Is making its way to the rest of the world. But the idea that, you know, overnight we would decide that bread was a toxic substance, as we did in 2002 at the low-carb craze. I mean, they look at us in like, what's wrong with you people? FLATOW: Right. Interesting turning point you make in the book occurred after World War II, and it had to do with munitions productions. Tell us about it. Mr. POLLAN: Yeah. Well it is very interesting. The industrialization of our agriculture is really the product of World War II. The pesticides come out of work on poison gases for the war. And fertilizer, which I actually think is the bigger of the innovations, came from ammonium nitrate, which was the main bomb material. We had a lot of ammonium nitrate and we were kind of figuring out how to convert this to domestic uses. And there was a day in 1947 where the big munitions plant at Muscle Shoals, Alabama, switched over from making bombs to making fertilizer. And that, I think, changes everything for the way we eat. And it was one of those very important events that completely unnoticed at the time. But you can trace a lot of the changes in the way we eat to that day. FLATOW: Of course, everything now depends on fertilizer. Mr. POLLAN: Yes. Well, except for organic agriculture, of course. But industrial agriculture from that point on changed its reliance from soil bacteria to generate nutrients or composting of animal wastes and crop wastes, to this very simple, basically, system for taking fossil fuel, which is how we make synthetic fertilizer, natural gas by-and-large, and creating fertility that way. And when you can buy fertility in a bag, you don't need to rotate your crops any more. You don't need animals on your farm any more. You can move to a complete monoculture, and it was a real boon for a plant like corn, which, of course, is a greedy plant. I mean, loves to eat fertilizer. FLATOW: Now let's, let's talk about corn. Because I, that is an incredible story you tell about the rise of corn from a simple grass into the cobs that we had today, which it never started out, and how it was only possible by this fertilizer. Mr. POLLAN: Well, you know, one of the most astounding things I learned in doing this research and in doing these kind of food detective stories about how we eat was learning that all that fast food, all that supermarket food, if you trace it back to its origins, because all our food begins with a plant growing somewhere under the sun, I kept ending up back in the same place, which is to say, a corn field in Iowa. It's the corn that feeds the steer that turns into the hamburger. It's the corn that sweetens the drink that we, you know --FLATOW: Let me just read from your book. You put it very succinctly in your book. You say, \u201cCorn is in the coffee, wine or in the Cheese Whiz, the frozen yogurt, the TV dinner, the canned fruit, the ketchup, the candy, the soups, the snacks, the cake mixes, the frosting, the gravy, the frozen waffle, the syrup, the hot sauce, the mayonnaise, the mustard, the hot dog, the bologna, the margarine, the shortening, the salad dressing, the relishes, even the vitamins. \u201d And then it goes, you go through all this, and then at the end you say, \u201cIndeed the supermarket itself, the wallboard, the joint compound, the linoleum, the fiberglass, the adhesives, of which the building itself has been built, is in no small matter a manifestation of corn. \u201d Mr. POLLAN: Yeah. This is the --FLATOW: And you said if you took clippings of our finger nails --Mr. POLLAN: Well that was, that was the astounding thing. I mean, we are the people of corn. You know, Mexicans talk about themselves as the corn people. They don't know the half of it. We are made bodily, the carbon that we are made of. You know, we are a carbon life form, as they used to say on STAR TREK, and most of the carbon that most of us are made from, unless you grow up perhaps on organic food, came from corn plants originally. And, in fact, working with a biologist on campus, we did some experiments. And if you take a little clip of your hair or fingernail and run it through a mass spectrometer, corn has a very distinctive signature. It has more carbon 13 than most plant carbons. And that identity, that signature, is preserved all the way through the process, even in the soda, even in the burger you ate for lunch. And as it turns out, as he put it, if you look at us Americans under the machine and then you look at Mexicans, the supposed corn people, he said, we look like corn chips on legs. FLATOW: Wow. Mr. POLLAN: And I, another experiment that I did was running a McDonald's meal through the, his machine, and I was astounded. I mean, the soda is 100% corn. FLATOW: From the corn syrup? Mr. POLLAN: It's all the corn syrup we see. High fructose corn syrup. The burgers were about 56 percent corn-based carbon. FLATOW: The burgers? Mr. POLLAN: The burgers. Because that's where the cow got its carbon. And also the rolls have high fructose corn syrup in it, and the ketchup has high fructose corn syrup. The chicken nugget is corn upon corn upon corn. Even the salad dressing. The Paul Newman supposedly healthy salad dressing is a heavily corn-based product. So that's what we're eating. You know, we're a little bit like the Irish, you know, who had their potato thing, and they were eating, they based their whole economy and eating on one crop. It's a dangerous way to eat. You don't, in nature -- One of the lessons we know from ecology is, you know, nature never puts all her eggs in one basket. And for any species to do that is not a wise thing. You know, the corn crop could fail. There is that to worry about. It is a very precarious monoculture. But I think of more immediate concern to most people is that we are omnivores. We're generalists. We do need those 50 different nutrients, 20 or 30 of which are plant compounds. And if we're just getting all our food from this one crop, we're not getting the lycopene, we're not getting the beta carotene, we're not getting all those other very important chemicals. And that's one of the reasons that you have people on a heavy fast-food diet who are actually overweight who are malnourished. In Oakland, near where I live, there are kids, very well fed on fast food, who come in to clinics with things like rickets. FLATOW: Really? Mr. POLLAN: That's unprecedented. That we are suffering from these micronutrient deficiencies, because, I think, we're eating too much of one thing. FLATOW: And not only that, by the energy it takes to grow the corn. The petroleum, right? That's something else you talked about. Mr. POLLAN: Well, that's another thing that I think was a tremendous surprise to me, and I don't think most people realize how much energy it takes to eat the way we eat. You know, all of life on earth is really this competition for energy, most of which comes from the sun, captured by plants, and then we fight over the plants with the animals. Or we eat the animals that ate the plants. And that's sort of how it works. Once we moved to chemical fertilizer, there was a new source of energy we introduced into our agriculture, and that was fossil fuel. To grow every bushel of corn takes about a third of a gallon of fossil fuel. And we're growing 10 billion bushels of corn a year. So that McDonald's, when you're having that McDonald's meal, you know, you are eating a couple of bushels of corn, which is to say, a couple gallons of oil. Twenty percent of our fossil fuel consumption today goes to feeding ourselves. That's more than we spend driving around in cars. So, you know, to the extent you're worried about energy consumption, you know you can buy your Prius and turn down the thermostat, but you really have to look at the way you're eating. FLATOW: Does it concern you that we're now talking about using corn to make ethanol? Mr. POLLAN: Yeah. I mean, ethanol is, don't get me started on ethanol. But --FLATOW: Go ahead. Get started. Mr. POLLAN: Ethanol is another corn disposal strategy. We have too much corn. We overproduce it, so we thought --FLATOW: Do we pay farmers not to grow it? Mr. POLLAN: No, no, no, we pay farmers to grow it, it's just the absurdity. We cut them a check for every bushel they grow. About 50 cents a bushel. A bushel, by the way, is 56 pounds of corn kernels. It's a hell of a lot of corn. So we're paying for the overproduction of corn. And then we spend a lot of money to get rid of it, either by feeding it to animals, or now we're trying to feed it to our cars. And so there's a real push on to subsidize the production of ethanol. The problem with ethanol that people don't notice, ethanol made from corn, is that it takes a lot of fossil fuel to distil the corn into the ethanol. Some estimates are it's a wash. It takes as many gallons of oil to make a gallon of ethanol. Some more happier estimates are . 9 gallons, right? So, you're not actually getting that much additional energy. There are much better things to make it from, switch grass being one of them. Make it from a perennial that doesn't cost a lot of energy to grow. FLATOW: What Brazilians do with sugar cane. Mr. POLLAN: Sugar cane. Sugar cane, too. I don't know that much about the energetics of sugar cane. But making it from corn is a joke. And the corn farmers are very excited about it. Cargo's very excited about it because they're just looking for new markets for their corn. But, you know, it comes back to the fact, you know, the tail wagging the dog in America is this 10 billion bushel pile that's piling up every fall. And we are, we have distorted our whole society to get rid of it. And that includes ourselves. We eat way too much of it. We're growing about five to 700 more calories per person per day on America's farms. And we have to get rid of those calories. And we're eating 200 of them. And that's the obesity epidemic right there. FLATOW: You point out that down river of some of these farms there are so many nitrates in the water that it's becoming dangerous to drink the water. Mr. POLLAN: Yeah, well, you know, growing corn with all this fossil fuel fertilizer, farmers use way too much of it, more than their fields can absorb because it's fairly cheap. It's a cheap energy problem. And it washes off the fields. It goes into the rivers. It goes, in the case of farm I was on, it ends up on the Des Moines River where people in Des Moines eat, drink their water. During the spring, during the heavy runoff, there are blue baby alerts. You're not supposed to give your kids the water. And then it keeps going down the Mississippi and it becomes a dead zone in the Gulf because, you know, we hear a lot about the carbon cycle, but in fact we've messed more with the nitrogen cycle on this planet. Half of the nitrogen now in circulation was fixed by this new technology. And so we're fertilizing some species, corn being one, algae being another, and all that nitrogen runs into the Gulf and you get these algae blooms that starves the water of oxygen and you end up with, you know, what is essentially a Bermuda triangle within the Gulf of Mexico where fish cannot live anymore, a dead zone the size of New Jersey. FLATOW: Talking with Michael Pollan, author of THE OMNIVORE'S DILEMMA: A NATURAL HISTORY OF FOUR MEALS. Number, 1-800-989-8255. Vivian in Long Island, hi. Welcome to Science Friday. VIVIAN (Caller): Oh, it's great to listen to your program. It's wonderful. I'm a legislator in Suffolk County, New York. And we've been working with the farmers here on lowering the pesticides and fertilizers. And as I'm listening to you speaking I wondered how far have we come since Frances Moore Lappe wrote DIET FOR A SMALL PLANET? Have we gotten much, much worse? Has anybody adjusted their eating habits thinking of the way we were eating a couple of decades ago? Mr. POLLAN: Well, I think that's a very good question. I mean, she, Frances Moore Lappe was saying, look, we're eating too high on the food chain. We're eating all this corn-fed beef. We still are. There are some better alternatives out there than there were back when she wrote that book in the \u201870s. And that is, you know, there's some real good news here, too, and that is that there's a very lively grass-finished beef industry starting up. There are farmers trying to put their farms back on the basis of solar energy, getting it off fossil fuel. Organic farmers do this to some extent and grass-fed farmers do this quite a bit, because when you think about it, there is no more sustainable food chain than having the sun feed the grass and having the grass feed the ruminants and having the ruminants feed us. That is a very sustainable food chain. And so there people moving back in that direction. FLATOW: Thank you for calling, Vivian. VIVIAN: There's a great farmer here on Long Island who has, grows potatoes, uses biodiesel from some of his crop and makes the cake, the potato chips he makes he uses for biodiesel to run the machinery for his farm. Mr. POLLAN: There are a lot of farmers really trying to close the loop here. And one of the things I tried to do in this book was find what I think is the most sustainable farmer in America. And there are people doing some incredibly greater work in getting us off of fossil fuel food. FLATOW: Thanks for calling, Vivian. Good luck to you out there in Long Island. VIVIAN: Oh, thank you for the great work. Bye. FLATOW: Take care. 1-800-989-8255 is our number. We're talking about food this hour on TALK OF THE NATION: Science Friday from NPR News with Michael Pollan, author of THE OMNIVORE'S DILEMMA: A NATURAL HISTORY OF FOUR MEALS. But can you overcome that, the inertia, the lobbying, the money, that's all wrapped up, you know? I think one of the biggest buildings in Washington is the Department of Agriculture. Mr. POLLAN: Yes. It should be called the Department of Corn because basically corn has its own agency of the government. They have their own corporations, too, ADM and Cargo, and their own state, Iowa. But it's hard to overcome. There is, you know, there was a farmer I spent a lot of time with, a corn farmer, and I said, who are you growing all this corn for, you know? Do you have a sense of your eaters on the other end? And he says, I'm growing it for the military industrial complex. And there's a sense in which he's right. This corn-based agriculture suits industry really well. It provides a cheap raw material for ADM, Cargo, Coca-Cola. They can tease this incredibly prodigious kernel into so many different products so cheaply that it's great business. On the other hand, it doesn't work without the subsidy system. It's a set of political choices that has led to this over-production of corn. And we could make other choices. And we do have this farm bill every seven years, and there's one coming up next year. And for the first time, at least in my memory, I think there's an opportunity for change. I think there really is this sense that we need a farm bill that thinks in terms of public health. You know, right now we're subsidizing high fructose corn syrup and we have an epidemic of obesity. Like, duh, doesn't that tell you that you've got to put these two things together, that one hand doesn't know what the other's doing? So could we have a farm bill that instead of subsidizing high fructose corn syrup, subsidize fruits and vegetables? Yeah, we could if we, you know, if people paid attention and didn't let the farm bill debate degenerate into a debate between, you know, the senator from Nebraska and the senator from Iowa. All of us have a dog in this fight. FLATOW: What about another feed stock or grain, like soybeans, things like that? Mr. POLLAN: Well, soybean is very much part of the story. And you're absolutely right because soy is the -- basically corn and soy take turns in these fields, the legume and the grass. And soy is another food that can be tricked up into all sorts of products. Basically a farmer growing corn and soybean is growing animal feed. That's where most of it's going. And the soy becomes the protein source for the animal and the corn becomes the energy source. So they're really in lock step. You've got to deal with both commodities at the same time. FLATOW: All right. We're going to take a break and come back and talk more with Michael Pollan, author of THE OMNIVORE'S DILEMMA. Take more of your phone calls. Stay with us. We'll be right back. You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION Science Friday. I'm Ira Flatow. We're talking this hour with Michael Pollan, author of THE OMNIVORE'S DILEMMA: A NATURAL HISTORY OF FOUR MEALS. Our number 1-800-989-8255. Let's go to James in Portland, Oregon. Hi, James. JAMES (Caller): Good afternoon. I haven't read the new book but I love THE BOTANY OF DESIRE. Anyway, out here in Portland we've got a really rapidly growing interest and marketplace in locally grown, organic, sustainable, and occasionally even biodynamically raised foods. So there's some positive light there. But it's pretty small percentage in the larger picture. And I'm also an advocate of switching from corn to things like hemp and other fibers and fuels and things like that, as well. So just wanted to throw in the comment and say good work and keep it going. FLATOW: Thank you. Mr. POLLAN: Thank you very much. You know, I think that there is a lot, I think you're absolutely right. There's a lot going on in the northwest. And there's a lot going on all over the country. I mean, there really is a new market forming. And I think that people are looking for solutions. They really want to feel better about what they're buying, for their health, for the health of the environment. And, you know, that explains a lot of the success of Whole Foods. But at the same time that's going on, there is a very vital local foods movement taking part. You know, the number of farmer's markets has doubled in the last decade. And there is an effort to eat off of a shorter food chain that will consume less energy, the food will be fresher, and it usually tastes a lot better, too. What's great about what's going on in the northwest is there's a lot of grass there. I mean, they have green grass almost 12 months of the year. So the idea that you would feed cattle, who are not evolved to ear corn, corn is absurd. And they're getting off of that, which I think is a very healthy development. FLATOW: And, you know, we've seen the instances where, because we talk about diseases that are spreading, you know, because you feed cattle meat, there are --Mr. POLLAN: Yes. There are --FLATOW: Are they getting that? Are they going to be getting away from that because of, you know, they're afraid of consumer? Or are they just --Mr. POLLAN: No. They're not going to change that. FLATOW: -- it's a 10-day memory and we're just going to --Mr. POLLAN: I mean E. coli 0157:H7 is a feedlot disease caused by the feeding of corn to cattle. It did not exist before we started doing that. And it has to do with the way corn changes the rumen and created an environment in which this new microbe that's so lethal to us could evolve. And, in fact, they learned at the time that simply by putting the animals back on grass for five days before slaughter, just five days, you could eliminate the E. coli 0157 from their systems. But it was too cumbersome and too expensive. What would they rather do? Irradiate the meat. FLATOW: Right. You know, it's a classic example of create a problem and then making money solving the problem with another technology. It's a band-aid. And instead of going back to what nature suggests we do with cows, which is feed them grass, and it will be very healthy meat for us and very healthy for the environment, it's just not fast or profitable enough. FLATOW: Or you create a genetically modified pig, right? Mr. POLLAN: Exactly. I mean, there's a classic example. Jon Stewart had it right. It's like, okay, whoa, let's see. We could eat pork in moderation or we could rearrange the cellular structure of the mammal. And we'd prefer to do the latter. So, you know, we're enamored of fancy solutions. FLATOW: Well, what are some good, what would you suggest? Let's talk about solutions then? Mr. POLLAN: Well, I think in a way the first and best solution is to put animals back on farms, get them off of feedlots. You know, we've urbanized all the livestock in this country, concentrating them on these, in these cities of filth. And like all primitive cities, they're subject to epidemics. So therefore we need antibiotics. How did the, why did the animals leave the farms to go to these cities? Well, basically because corn got so cheap that a farmer could not grow corn as cheaply as a feed lot operator could buy it on the market because it sold for much less than the cost of production. So there was no economic incentive to keep the animals on the farm. And as soon as you move the animals into the feed lots, you have what, in Wendell Barry's great phrase, is we took a solution, which is having animals and crops on farms so that the animals provide fertility and the crops provide food for the animals. We took the solution and neatly divided it into two problems, which is to say a pollution problem on the feed lots and a fertility problem on the farms that we have to remedy with all this fossil fuel fertilizer. So I think we have to turn back the clock on that move. And if the price of corn were higher, and it could be that if we changed our agricultural policies, it would make sense to keep the animals around. And if you keep the animals around, you no longer have that monoculture of corn and soybeans because then you need some pastures for your animals. And then you have a source of fertility on the farm. And suddenly you have a system that is closer to the way an ecosystem works. And I met farmers who are doing this. FLATOW: Yes. Mr. POLLAN: And I think the happiest thing I learned in the course of doing this book, which goes way beyond the food system to our whole understanding of the human relationship to nature. Is, I went to this farm called Polyphus Farm in Virginia, in Swope, Virginia. And it's a very subtle, complicated farm were six different animals were grown in a very careful rotation, such that the waste of one becomes the food of another. And they keep taking turns in these pastures. And basically, to give you a very quick illustration of what he does, the cattle are intensively grazed and they're moved every day. Then he waits three days and he brings in something called the chicken mobile, which is a portable henhouse. And the chickens fan out and what they do is they eat the grubs, the larvae in the manure, which is their favorite source of protein. And in the process of digging those grubs out, they spread the manure around the farm, and they also, the reason he waits three days to move them is so that the grubs can grow large and fat --FLATOW: Juicy. Mr. POLLAN: Really juicy. But if he waited five days they'd hatch, you see, and he'd have a fly problem. So he's actually growing larvae to feed his chickens. And because they eat the larvae, there's no fly problem, so he doesn't need chemicals to keep the flies off his cows. They also, the chickens copiously fertilize this pasture with their manure. At the end of a year, and then the pigs come in, and there's a whole, kind of rotation of other animals, but at the end of a year, this pasture has more topsoil than it did at the beginning of the year, more fertility and more biodiversity in the soil. At the same time, we have taken off this immense amount of food, of chickens and eggs, and pork and beef. You know, we usually think that for us to get what we want from nature, nature is diminished. It's a zero sum game and we subtract. Well, what this shows you is there really is a free lunch in nature. And, because, if you're getting all this food and you're actually improving the land at the same time, that's a whole new paradigm to think about your relationship to nature, and it's the most hopeful thing I've seen in the whole environmental area for a long time. There is a way --FLATOW: He can make a living at this? Mr. POLLAN: Yeah, and he makes a terrific living. He does a lot better than the corn farmers who are depending on government subsidies to survive or the job of their wives in town. This farm produces, it's on only 500 acres, just 100 of which are open, the rest is forest. It supports two white collar salaries and the salaries of two helpers as well. He's one of the most successful farmers in the country. FLATOW: Because I guess, I understand from the time that you spent with these farmers who were on their tractors plowing fields of corn all day that they're not very happy about it either. Mr. POLLAN: They're not. FLATOW: They'd like something better. Mr. POLLAN: They feel trapped in the system. They're all looking for alternatives. They understand that growing all this corn and soybeans to feed all these animals on feedlots is, it's not what they want to be doing. But they don't see an alternative. You know, I said to George Naylor, this farmer in Iowa, I said, well why don't you grow something else? Here you are, you know, with this beautiful soil. And he said, what am I going to grow, broccoli? Who's going to eat the broccoli? There are no people left in Iowa, because the corn pushed them all out. And he also, you know, he said that the elevator, the grain elevator is telling me all they want are corn and soybeans. So there's no, Iowa's a food desert. I mean, they don't feed themselves. Eighty percent of their food is imported, even though it's the breadbasket of America. FLATOW: And you said the farmers don't even feed themselves. Mr. POLLAN: The farmers can no longer feed themselves because their farms are no longer diversified. They used to have some chickens, they used to have some apple trees, they used to have some other crops. They used to have 14 crops, now they only have these two. And those corn and soybeans are not edible. That's feed corn. So, they cannot, it's kind of a very sad thing, that you have this food desert in the middle of Iowa. FLATOW: You said that you're, changing topics just a bit, that you're disappointed with science journalism these days. Mr. POLLAN: I think on the subject of nutrition. I think that they've, and it's completely well intentioned, but, you know, every new study that comes out, at least the way it gets covered by us journalists, and I count myself as one of these science journalists because that's what I do, has left the public very confused about what to eat. The, you know, there was recently this women's health initiative that suggested that, oh, low-fat diets may not help with cancer and cardiovascular disease, and suddenly, certain people saw that headline, and I have to say it was really overplayed, the headlines and the studies didn't actually go together that well, and suddenly people were like, oh, it doesn't even matter. I might as well go back to my high-fat diet. You know, if you looked more closely, you realize the women in that study were actually not telling the truth about what they were eating, because they claimed to be eating 1500 calories a day, and to weigh 180 pounds, and I have to tell you, if they were really eating that little, they would not be weighing 180 pounds. So a lot of these nutrition studies are just faulty to begin with. And there is an underlying cultural wisdom about food that should remain undisturbed by all the science, until the science is really good, and that is to eat a great many different things, and not too many of them. It's really simple. FLATOW: So there's really no, forget the fad diets, forget all that stuff. Just eat a little bit of what? Mr. POLLAN: Eat less. FLATOW: Eat less. Mr. POLLAN: It's the one message that is forbidden in our culture. FLATOW: Eat less. Mr. POLLAN: There is no money in the message eat less. But if you want to see a certifiable, scientifically verifiable finding about food, it's that the less you eat, the healthier you are, up to a point. And there is a real connection there. But, you know, eat the way, I tell people, look, if you could, you know, would your great grandmother eat this? How would she, would she recognize this as food? You're probably better off with that than any number of scientific studies. FLATOW: Right. Should we trust organic food labeling? I mean --Mr. POLLAN: Yes and no. Yes in that we haven't found cases of fraud, and in fact this food is grown without pesticides and in a more sustainable way than other foods. In that sense, it's a very reliable label. In this sense it's not: the image of organic food, of animals happily, you know, dairy cows grazing on grass and chickens free-ranging around the barnyard, I'm sorry to say, having visited these places, is often not the case. It's not all its cracked up to be. Organic has gotten very industrialized too. Organic food is also soaked in fossil fuel. We are moving organic produce across the country. We're moving, you know, I spent some time in Whole Foods, and there was, you know, asparagus from Argentina on the east, in California. On the east coast here there was lettuce from the central valley of California. It takes 56 calories of fossil fuel to move one calorie of lettuce across the country to a plate in New York City. You know, lettuce is great, salads are wonderful, but you're really paying a lot of money to ship water across the country. And, you know, that is not sustainable eating, even if it's organic. FLATOW: Talking with Michael Pollan, author of THE OMNIVORE'S DILEMMA on TALK OF THE NATION: Science Friday on NPR News. So this is all, this is because we want foods out of season? We want South American vegetables in the wintertime, right? Mr. POLLAN: You're absolutely right. I mean, we are implicated in this problem. At the end of the industrial food chain has emerged a species called an industrial eater. An industrial eater is somebody who wants strawberries all year round, wants tomatoes all year round, who wants their food to be very convenient, microwavable, who wants to eat what he wants, what she wants, anytime. And that's part of the problem. He also wants to eat in the car. I mean 19 percent of our meals are eaten in the car. FLATOW: I was going to say, there's no more sit-down meal with the family or with friends. Mr. POLLAN: No, the family dinner is on the verge of extinction. And, I think that that's a social as well as environmental tragedy, because around the table is where we socialize our children. It's one of the most important institutions of a civilized society, is the dinner table. And, but we have food marketers convincing children that they need to eat this and that and basically, going over the head of mom and marketing to each segment of the family. And the result is that a family dinner today, and this is a portrait I'm not painting, this is how General Mills painted it to me because they've studied this. They put cameras up in people's homes to see how they really eat. Even if they say they're eating a family dinner, well this is what it turns out they really do. Each member of the family has their single portion microwave entr\u00e9e that they're eating, you know. One kid is into pizza, another kid's into, is a vegetarian. And dad's doing the, you know, Atkins thing. And they zap their food, and the food has been designed so an eight-year-old can safely cook it. And then they bring it to the table where poor mom is there, because she's actually cooked something because has this sense of, that's what a mom should do, I guess. And they kind of pass in the night. And they spend a few minutes overlapping, but they're not all there at the same time, and they're not eating the same thing. And why is that? Well, because when we eat something separate, we end up eating more. And when you market to that child, you're going to get more calories into that child than you would if you market to the mom and she decides this is what we should eat. So I think the food companies, even though this may not have been their intention, deserve some of the blame for destroying the family dinner. Not to mention the fast food companies. As I said, you know, if we're eating a fifth of our meals in cars, that's an industrial eater. So we're going to have to change our own habits before we can change this food chain. If you buy locally, if you start going to farmer's markets, you know, you're not going to find microwavable products there. You're going to have to relearn the arts of cooking. You're going to have to start sitting down to dinner again. And, all of which would be wonderful. These are very simple things we can do, and we, you know, we're told we're too busy. We're told we don't have enough money. And perhaps that's true for some people. But by and large, it's a matter of priorities. And we've been convinced that we don't have time to cook. It really doesn't take that long to make a good meal. It doesn't take three hours. When they first started coming out with convenience foods in mixes, the industry, this was in the \u201850s, the industry really had to fight the American housewife, who said, wait a minute, this isn't drudgery. I love to cook. I get great satisfaction out of feeding my, this is one of the great satisfactions in my life. And it took years of propaganda, years of marketing, to persuade them that cooking is drudgery. It's not. It's one of the great pleasures of life. FLATOW: The Norman Rockwell painting, right? Mr. POLLAN: It is the Norman Rockwell painting. FLATOW: Family around the dinner table. Mr. POLLAN: Exactly. Around the dinner table, yeah. It's a, you know, it's a wonderful institution and it's a shame to see it in trouble. But there are very optimistic signs that it's coming back. I mean, people are rediscovering cooking. It's very interesting that we should be obsessed with chefs. Chefs are celebrities now. FLATOW: Right. That's right. Mr. POLLAN: And we watch the food channel and it's an odd disconnect that we're elevating cooking as a very important art form at a moment where we're doing less of it than ever before. I haven't figured that out yet. FLATOW: Well when you do you'll come back and tell us more about it. Mr. POLLAN: I'd be happy to. FLATOW: Or there will be another book, I'm sure. My guest is Michael Pollan, author of THE OMNIVORE'S DILEMMA: A NATURAL HISTORY OF FOUR MEALS. A great book, I highly recommend it to you. You know Michael Pollan's work, you know that you'll like this book.  IRA FLATOW, host:  The rest of the hour, we're gonna be taking a look at what my next guest calls our national eating disorder. Before you sit down to your next meal, I want you to take a minute to consider what's on your plate. I mean, really consider where did the food come from and don't say the grocery store. Do you really know anything about the origins of your meal? Yeah, sure, the steak comes from a cow, the potato comes from a field, but a cow raised on what? A potato field growing where? How many miles did it travel to get to you? And something I'll bet you haven't considered, how many barrels of oil did it take to make the meal you are about to eat?  Well my next guest has pondered all of these questions about what we eat, where it comes from. He has gathered his findings in a new book called THE OMNIVORE'S DILEMMA. And I guarantee that after reading this book, you won't think of your food in the same way again, especially the section on corn, where he says that just about everything around us, everything has corn connected to it. And not just your food we're talking about. Well, let him talk about it.  My next guest is Michael Pollan, author of THE OMNIVORE'S DILEMMA: A NATURAL HISTORY OF FOUR MEALS. He's contributing writer to The New York Times Magazine, night professor of journalism at the University of California Berkeley. He's here in our New York studios. Welcome back to SCIENCE FRIDAY.  Mr. MICHAEL POLLAN (University of California Berkeley): Thank you, Ira. Good to be back.  FLATOW: That's pretty, pretty damning talk to talk about our obsession with food. And, not in a good way. Why, why do you say that?  Mr. POLLAN: Well, I think we do have an eating disorder. You know, eating disorders don't just afflict teenaged girls. A whole culture can have one when it falls into a deep anxiety and confusion about what to eat. You know, this is one of the most basic things any animal does, is find dinner for itself. And most animals know exactly how to go about it. And we don't any more. I think we did for a long time.  FLATOW: When did we stop?  Mr. POLLAN: Well, the basic, the omnivore's dilemma, that idea, which is a term used by some anthropologists and psychologists to describe the predicament of any species that can eat a great many things in nature and needs to eat a great many different things. We need about 50 different kinds of molecules and atoms, basically, to survive.  So, if you have such broad needs, you need, you have a lot of anxiety about food to begin with, because, is that mushroom safe? Is that one dangerous? What about that berry? Can I eat that animal? Is it too old? So a lot of kind of cognitive space and time must be applied to this eating problem. If you are a generalist.  If you are a specialist eater, say you are a koala bear, if it looks and smells like a eucalyptus leaf, it's lunch. And if it doesn't, it's something else. It's the world. And you know cows are the same way with grass.  But if you're a generalist, like us, the rats, the cockroaches, we have some kind of unsavory company in this kind of eater, you need a system to figure this out. You need to divide the world into what's okay to eat, what's not okay to eat. We have prodigious powers of memory and recognition. We can remember that that mushroom made us sick last week, so don't eat it. But we have something even better, which is a culture.  Culture is a fancy word for what your mom tells you it's ok to eat, basically. And so we put a name on that mushroom. We call it the death cap. And that very helpfully tells us -- FLATOW: Tells us, don't eat. Just stay away.  Mr. POLLAN: And we have developed a set of taboos, cuisines, manners at the table, you know, the order in which to eat things, how much to eat, and this is our culture of food. And it has held steady for thousands and thousands of years, but it's broken down. And I think I would date it to about 50 years ago.  FLATOW: All right, we'll come back and tease it out here. Where it has broken down. Why you say about 50 years ago.  Talking with Michael Pollan, the author of THE OMNIVORE'S DILEMMA: A NATURAL HISTORY OF FOUR MEALS. We'll take your calls: 1-800-989-8255. Stay with us, we'll be right back. I'm Ira Flatow, this is TALK OF THE NATION's Science Friday, from NPR News.  You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION's Science Friday. I'm Ira Flatow. Talking with Michael Pollan, author of THE OMNIVORE'S DILEMMA: A NATURAL HISTORY OF FOUR MEALS.  And you were talking about when our things broke down in how we eat. You said it was about 50 years ago. What happened?  Mr. POLLAN: Yeah, I guess I would say the breakdown really begins with the industrialization of our food supply. You, you know, if you think about what we eat, what we eat has changed more in the last 50 years probably than in the last 5,000. We have all these new food products that your great-grandmother would not recognize as food. And arguably, they are not food. They're food products. But, you know, if you gave her Gogurt or a Pop-Tart, she wouldn't know what to do with it.  So we've had this explosion of new products, 15,000 new ones every year. We've also had marketing to each member of the family, which tends to break down the mother's and father's authority over what the family eats. So you've got parents in competition with food marketers, essentially, to completely throw up into the air what is a good meal? What should be you eating? Should you be eating fats or carbs?  And we have scientists. I think scientists are actually a big part of the problem when it comes to food. We get a lot of, we hear a lot of very conflicting advice. We get, you know, new discoveries every few years, whether we should worry about carbs or fats or transfats or omega 3s. And I think that this kind of cacophony of dietary advice has really thrown us off our game, and add to that the fact that in America, we've never had a very strong food culture, the way the French or the Italians do, that really steadies people's eating habits.  FLATOW: Right. They would never, they look at our processed food like we're nutty.  Mr. POLLAN: They do, and, although gradually our way of eating, I'm sad to say -- FLATOW: Is making its way -- Mr. POLLAN: Is making its way to the rest of the world. But the idea that, you know, overnight we would decide that bread was a toxic substance, as we did in 2002 at the low-carb craze. I mean, they look at us in like, what's wrong with you people?  FLATOW: Right. Interesting turning point you make in the book occurred after World War II, and it had to do with munitions productions. Tell us about it.  Mr. POLLAN: Yeah. Well it is very interesting. The industrialization of our agriculture is really the product of World War II. The pesticides come out of work on poison gases for the war. And fertilizer, which I actually think is the bigger of the innovations, came from ammonium nitrate, which was the main bomb material. We had a lot of ammonium nitrate and we were kind of figuring out how to convert this to domestic uses.  And there was a day in 1947 where the big munitions plant at Muscle Shoals, Alabama, switched over from making bombs to making fertilizer. And that, I think, changes everything for the way we eat. And it was one of those very important events that completely unnoticed at the time. But you can trace a lot of the changes in the way we eat to that day.  FLATOW: Of course, everything now depends on fertilizer.  Mr. POLLAN: Yes. Well, except for organic agriculture, of course.  But industrial agriculture from that point on changed its reliance from soil bacteria to generate nutrients or composting of animal wastes and crop wastes, to this very simple, basically, system for taking fossil fuel, which is how we make synthetic fertilizer, natural gas by-and-large, and creating fertility that way. And when you can buy fertility in a bag, you don't need to rotate your crops any more. You don't need animals on your farm any more. You can move to a complete monoculture, and it was a real boon for a plant like corn, which, of course, is a greedy plant. I mean, loves to eat fertilizer.  FLATOW: Now let's, let's talk about corn. Because I, that is an incredible story you tell about the rise of corn from a simple grass into the cobs that we had today, which it never started out, and how it was only possible by this fertilizer.  Mr. POLLAN: Well, you know, one of the most astounding things I learned in doing this research and in doing these kind of food detective stories about how we eat was learning that all that fast food, all that supermarket food, if you trace it back to its origins, because all our food begins with a plant growing somewhere under the sun, I kept ending up back in the same place, which is to say, a corn field in Iowa. It's the corn that feeds the steer that turns into the hamburger. It's the corn that sweetens the drink that we, you know -- FLATOW: Let me just read from your book. You put it very succinctly in your book. You say, \u201cCorn is in the coffee, wine or in the Cheese Whiz, the frozen yogurt, the TV dinner, the canned fruit, the ketchup, the candy, the soups, the snacks, the cake mixes, the frosting, the gravy, the frozen waffle, the syrup, the hot sauce, the mayonnaise, the mustard, the hot dog, the bologna, the margarine, the shortening, the salad dressing, the relishes, even the vitamins. \u201d  And then it goes, you go through all this, and then at the end you say, \u201cIndeed the supermarket itself, the wallboard, the joint compound, the linoleum, the fiberglass, the adhesives, of which the building itself has been built, is in no small matter a manifestation of corn. \u201d  Mr. POLLAN: Yeah. This is the -- FLATOW: And you said if you took clippings of our finger nails -- Mr. POLLAN: Well that was, that was the astounding thing. I mean, we are the people of corn. You know, Mexicans talk about themselves as the corn people. They don't know the half of it. We are made bodily, the carbon that we are made of. You know, we are a carbon life form, as they used to say on STAR TREK, and most of the carbon that most of us are made from, unless you grow up perhaps on organic food, came from corn plants originally.  And, in fact, working with a biologist on campus, we did some experiments. And if you take a little clip of your hair or fingernail and run it through a mass spectrometer, corn has a very distinctive signature. It has more carbon 13 than most plant carbons. And that identity, that signature, is preserved all the way through the process, even in the soda, even in the burger you ate for lunch. And as it turns out, as he put it, if you look at us Americans under the machine and then you look at Mexicans, the supposed corn people, he said, we look like corn chips on legs.  FLATOW: Wow.  Mr. POLLAN: And I, another experiment that I did was running a McDonald's meal through the, his machine, and I was astounded. I mean, the soda is 100% corn.  FLATOW: From the corn syrup?  Mr. POLLAN: It's all the corn syrup we see. High fructose corn syrup. The burgers were about 56 percent corn-based carbon.  FLATOW: The burgers?  Mr. POLLAN: The burgers. Because that's where the cow got its carbon. And also the rolls have high fructose corn syrup in it, and the ketchup has high fructose corn syrup. The chicken nugget is corn upon corn upon corn. Even the salad dressing. The Paul Newman supposedly healthy salad dressing is a heavily corn-based product. So that's what we're eating.  You know, we're a little bit like the Irish, you know, who had their potato thing, and they were eating, they based their whole economy and eating on one crop. It's a dangerous way to eat. You don't, in nature -- One of the lessons we know from ecology is, you know, nature never puts all her eggs in one basket. And for any species to do that is not a wise thing. You know, the corn crop could fail. There is that to worry about. It is a very precarious monoculture.  But I think of more immediate concern to most people is that we are omnivores. We're generalists. We do need those 50 different nutrients, 20 or 30 of which are plant compounds. And if we're just getting all our food from this one crop, we're not getting the lycopene, we're not getting the beta carotene, we're not getting all those other very important chemicals.  And that's one of the reasons that you have people on a heavy fast-food diet who are actually overweight who are malnourished. In Oakland, near where I live, there are kids, very well fed on fast food, who come in to clinics with things like rickets.  FLATOW: Really?  Mr. POLLAN: That's unprecedented. That we are suffering from these micronutrient deficiencies, because, I think, we're eating too much of one thing.  FLATOW: And not only that, by the energy it takes to grow the corn. The petroleum, right? That's something else you talked about.  Mr. POLLAN: Well, that's another thing that I think was a tremendous surprise to me, and I don't think most people realize how much energy it takes to eat the way we eat. You know, all of life on earth is really this competition for energy, most of which comes from the sun, captured by plants, and then we fight over the plants with the animals. Or we eat the animals that ate the plants. And that's sort of how it works.  Once we moved to chemical fertilizer, there was a new source of energy we introduced into our agriculture, and that was fossil fuel. To grow every bushel of corn takes about a third of a gallon of fossil fuel. And we're growing 10 billion bushels of corn a year. So that McDonald's, when you're having that McDonald's meal, you know, you are eating a couple of bushels of corn, which is to say, a couple gallons of oil.  Twenty percent of our fossil fuel consumption today goes to feeding ourselves. That's more than we spend driving around in cars. So, you know, to the extent you're worried about energy consumption, you know you can buy your Prius and turn down the thermostat, but you really have to look at the way you're eating.  FLATOW: Does it concern you that we're now talking about using corn to make ethanol?  Mr. POLLAN: Yeah. I mean, ethanol is, don't get me started on ethanol. But -- FLATOW: Go ahead. Get started.  Mr. POLLAN: Ethanol is another corn disposal strategy. We have too much corn. We overproduce it, so we thought -- FLATOW: Do we pay farmers not to grow it?  Mr. POLLAN: No, no, no, we pay farmers to grow it, it's just the absurdity. We cut them a check for every bushel they grow. About 50 cents a bushel. A bushel, by the way, is 56 pounds of corn kernels. It's a hell of a lot of corn. So we're paying for the overproduction of corn. And then we spend a lot of money to get rid of it, either by feeding it to animals, or now we're trying to feed it to our cars.  And so there's a real push on to subsidize the production of ethanol. The problem with ethanol that people don't notice, ethanol made from corn, is that it takes a lot of fossil fuel to distil the corn into the ethanol. Some estimates are it's a wash. It takes as many gallons of oil to make a gallon of ethanol. Some more happier estimates are . 9 gallons, right? So, you're not actually getting that much additional energy. There are much better things to make it from, switch grass being one of them. Make it from a perennial that doesn't cost a lot of energy to grow.  FLATOW: What Brazilians do with sugar cane.  Mr. POLLAN: Sugar cane. Sugar cane, too. I don't know that much about the energetics of sugar cane. But making it from corn is a joke. And the corn farmers are very excited about it. Cargo's very excited about it because they're just looking for new markets for their corn.  But, you know, it comes back to the fact, you know, the tail wagging the dog in America is this 10 billion bushel pile that's piling up every fall. And we are, we have distorted our whole society to get rid of it. And that includes ourselves. We eat way too much of it. We're growing about five to 700 more calories per person per day on America's farms. And we have to get rid of those calories.  And we're eating 200 of them. And that's the obesity epidemic right there.  FLATOW: You point out that down river of some of these farms there are so many nitrates in the water that it's becoming dangerous to drink the water.  Mr. POLLAN: Yeah, well, you know, growing corn with all this fossil fuel fertilizer, farmers use way too much of it, more than their fields can absorb because it's fairly cheap. It's a cheap energy problem. And it washes off the fields. It goes into the rivers. It goes, in the case of farm I was on, it ends up on the Des Moines River where people in Des Moines eat, drink their water.  During the spring, during the heavy runoff, there are blue baby alerts. You're not supposed to give your kids the water. And then it keeps going down the Mississippi and it becomes a dead zone in the Gulf because, you know, we hear a lot about the carbon cycle, but in fact we've messed more with the nitrogen cycle on this planet. Half of the nitrogen now in circulation was fixed by this new technology.  And so we're fertilizing some species, corn being one, algae being another, and all that nitrogen runs into the Gulf and you get these algae blooms that starves the water of oxygen and you end up with, you know, what is essentially a Bermuda triangle within the Gulf of Mexico where fish cannot live anymore, a dead zone the size of New Jersey.  FLATOW: Talking with Michael Pollan, author of THE OMNIVORE'S DILEMMA: A NATURAL HISTORY OF FOUR MEALS. Number, 1-800-989-8255.  Vivian in Long Island, hi. Welcome to Science Friday.  VIVIAN (Caller): Oh, it's great to listen to your program. It's wonderful. I'm a legislator in Suffolk County, New York. And we've been working with the farmers here on lowering the pesticides and fertilizers. And as I'm listening to you speaking I wondered how far have we come since Frances Moore Lappe wrote DIET FOR A SMALL PLANET? Have we gotten much, much worse? Has anybody adjusted their eating habits thinking of the way we were eating a couple of decades ago?  Mr. POLLAN: Well, I think that's a very good question. I mean, she, Frances Moore Lappe was saying, look, we're eating too high on the food chain. We're eating all this corn-fed beef. We still are. There are some better alternatives out there than there were back when she wrote that book in the \u201870s. And that is, you know, there's some real good news here, too, and that is that there's a very lively grass-finished beef industry starting up.  There are farmers trying to put their farms back on the basis of solar energy, getting it off fossil fuel. Organic farmers do this to some extent and grass-fed farmers do this quite a bit, because when you think about it, there is no more sustainable food chain than having the sun feed the grass and having the grass feed the ruminants and having the ruminants feed us. That is a very sustainable food chain. And so there people moving back in that direction.  FLATOW: Thank you for calling, Vivian.  VIVIAN: There's a great farmer here on Long Island who has, grows potatoes, uses biodiesel from some of his crop and makes the cake, the potato chips he makes he uses for biodiesel to run the machinery for his farm.  Mr. POLLAN: There are a lot of farmers really trying to close the loop here. And one of the things I tried to do in this book was find what I think is the most sustainable farmer in America. And there are people doing some incredibly greater work in getting us off of fossil fuel food.  FLATOW: Thanks for calling, Vivian. Good luck to you out there in Long Island.  VIVIAN: Oh, thank you for the great work. Bye.  FLATOW: Take care. 1-800-989-8255 is our number. We're talking about food this hour on TALK OF THE NATION: Science Friday from NPR News with Michael Pollan, author of THE OMNIVORE'S DILEMMA: A NATURAL HISTORY OF FOUR MEALS.  But can you overcome that, the inertia, the lobbying, the money, that's all wrapped up, you know? I think one of the biggest buildings in Washington is the Department of Agriculture.  Mr. POLLAN: Yes. It should be called the Department of Corn because basically corn has its own agency of the government. They have their own corporations, too, ADM and Cargo, and their own state, Iowa.  But it's hard to overcome. There is, you know, there was a farmer I spent a lot of time with, a corn farmer, and I said, who are you growing all this corn for, you know? Do you have a sense of your eaters on the other end?  And he says, I'm growing it for the military industrial complex. And there's a sense in which he's right. This corn-based agriculture suits industry really well. It provides a cheap raw material for ADM, Cargo, Coca-Cola. They can tease this incredibly prodigious kernel into so many different products so cheaply that it's great business.  On the other hand, it doesn't work without the subsidy system. It's a set of political choices that has led to this over-production of corn. And we could make other choices. And we do have this farm bill every seven years, and there's one coming up next year. And for the first time, at least in my memory, I think there's an opportunity for change. I think there really is this sense that we need a farm bill that thinks in terms of public health.  You know, right now we're subsidizing high fructose corn syrup and we have an epidemic of obesity. Like, duh, doesn't that tell you that you've got to put these two things together, that one hand doesn't know what the other's doing?  So could we have a farm bill that instead of subsidizing high fructose corn syrup, subsidize fruits and vegetables? Yeah, we could if we, you know, if people paid attention and didn't let the farm bill debate degenerate into a debate between, you know, the senator from Nebraska and the senator from Iowa. All of us have a dog in this fight.  FLATOW: What about another feed stock or grain, like soybeans, things like that?  Mr. POLLAN: Well, soybean is very much part of the story. And you're absolutely right because soy is the -- basically corn and soy take turns in these fields, the legume and the grass. And soy is another food that can be tricked up into all sorts of products.  Basically a farmer growing corn and soybean is growing animal feed. That's where most of it's going. And the soy becomes the protein source for the animal and the corn becomes the energy source. So they're really in lock step. You've got to deal with both commodities at the same time.  FLATOW: All right. We're going to take a break and come back and talk more with Michael Pollan, author of THE OMNIVORE'S DILEMMA. Take more of your phone calls. Stay with us. We'll be right back.  You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION Science Friday. I'm Ira Flatow. We're talking this hour with Michael Pollan, author of THE OMNIVORE'S DILEMMA: A NATURAL HISTORY OF FOUR MEALS. Our number 1-800-989-8255.  Let's go to James in Portland, Oregon. Hi, James.  JAMES (Caller): Good afternoon. I haven't read the new book but I love THE BOTANY OF DESIRE. Anyway, out here in Portland we've got a really rapidly growing interest and marketplace in locally grown, organic, sustainable, and occasionally even biodynamically raised foods. So there's some positive light there. But it's pretty small percentage in the larger picture. And I'm also an advocate of switching from corn to things like hemp and other fibers and fuels and things like that, as well. So just wanted to throw in the comment and say good work and keep it going.  FLATOW: Thank you.  Mr. POLLAN: Thank you very much. You know, I think that there is a lot, I think you're absolutely right. There's a lot going on in the northwest. And there's a lot going on all over the country. I mean, there really is a new market forming. And I think that people are looking for solutions. They really want to feel better about what they're buying, for their health, for the health of the environment.  And, you know, that explains a lot of the success of Whole Foods. But at the same time that's going on, there is a very vital local foods movement taking part. You know, the number of farmer's markets has doubled in the last decade. And there is an effort to eat off of a shorter food chain that will consume less energy, the food will be fresher, and it usually tastes a lot better, too.  What's great about what's going on in the northwest is there's a lot of grass there. I mean, they have green grass almost 12 months of the year. So the idea that you would feed cattle, who are not evolved to ear corn, corn is absurd. And they're getting off of that, which I think is a very healthy development.  FLATOW: And, you know, we've seen the instances where, because we talk about diseases that are spreading, you know, because you feed cattle meat, there are -- Mr. POLLAN: Yes. There are -- FLATOW: Are they getting that? Are they going to be getting away from that because of, you know, they're afraid of consumer? Or are they just -- Mr. POLLAN: No. They're not going to change that.  FLATOW: -- it's a 10-day memory and we're just going to -- Mr. POLLAN: I mean E. coli 0157:H7 is a feedlot disease caused by the feeding of corn to cattle. It did not exist before we started doing that. And it has to do with the way corn changes the rumen and created an environment in which this new microbe that's so lethal to us could evolve. And, in fact, they learned at the time that simply by putting the animals back on grass for five days before slaughter, just five days, you could eliminate the E. coli 0157 from their systems. But it was too cumbersome and too expensive. What would they rather do? Irradiate the meat.  FLATOW: Right.  You know, it's a classic example of create a problem and then making money solving the problem with another technology. It's a band-aid. And instead of going back to what nature suggests we do with cows, which is feed them grass, and it will be very healthy meat for us and very healthy for the environment, it's just not fast or profitable enough.  FLATOW: Or you create a genetically modified pig, right?  Mr. POLLAN: Exactly. I mean, there's a classic example. Jon Stewart had it right. It's like, okay, whoa, let's see. We could eat pork in moderation or we could rearrange the cellular structure of the mammal. And we'd prefer to do the latter.  So, you know, we're enamored of fancy solutions.  FLATOW: Well, what are some good, what would you suggest? Let's talk about solutions then?  Mr. POLLAN: Well, I think in a way the first and best solution is to put animals back on farms, get them off of feedlots. You know, we've urbanized all the livestock in this country, concentrating them on these, in these cities of filth. And like all primitive cities, they're subject to epidemics. So therefore we need antibiotics. How did the, why did the animals leave the farms to go to these cities? Well, basically because corn got so cheap that a farmer could not grow corn as cheaply as a feed lot operator could buy it on the market because it sold for much less than the cost of production.  So there was no economic incentive to keep the animals on the farm. And as soon as you move the animals into the feed lots, you have what, in Wendell Barry's great phrase, is we took a solution, which is having animals and crops on farms so that the animals provide fertility and the crops provide food for the animals. We took the solution and neatly divided it into two problems, which is to say a pollution problem on the feed lots and a fertility problem on the farms that we have to remedy with all this fossil fuel fertilizer.  So I think we have to turn back the clock on that move. And if the price of corn were higher, and it could be that if we changed our agricultural policies, it would make sense to keep the animals around. And if you keep the animals around, you no longer have that monoculture of corn and soybeans because then you need some pastures for your animals.  And then you have a source of fertility on the farm. And suddenly you have a system that is closer to the way an ecosystem works. And I met farmers who are doing this.  FLATOW: Yes.  Mr. POLLAN: And I think the happiest thing I learned in the course of doing this book, which goes way beyond the food system to our whole understanding of the human relationship to nature. Is, I went to this farm called Polyphus Farm in Virginia, in Swope, Virginia. And it's a very subtle, complicated farm were six different animals were grown in a very careful rotation, such that the waste of one becomes the food of another. And they keep taking turns in these pastures.  And basically, to give you a very quick illustration of what he does, the cattle are intensively grazed and they're moved every day. Then he waits three days and he brings in something called the chicken mobile, which is a portable henhouse. And the chickens fan out and what they do is they eat the grubs, the larvae in the manure, which is their favorite source of protein. And in the process of digging those grubs out, they spread the manure around the farm, and they also, the reason he waits three days to move them is so that the grubs can grow large and fat -- FLATOW: Juicy.  Mr. POLLAN: Really juicy. But if he waited five days they'd hatch, you see, and he'd have a fly problem. So he's actually growing larvae to feed his chickens. And because they eat the larvae, there's no fly problem, so he doesn't need chemicals to keep the flies off his cows. They also, the chickens copiously fertilize this pasture with their manure.  At the end of a year, and then the pigs come in, and there's a whole, kind of rotation of other animals, but at the end of a year, this pasture has more topsoil than it did at the beginning of the year, more fertility and more biodiversity in the soil.  At the same time, we have taken off this immense amount of food, of chickens and eggs, and pork and beef. You know, we usually think that for us to get what we want from nature, nature is diminished. It's a zero sum game and we subtract. Well, what this shows you is there really is a free lunch in nature. And, because, if you're getting all this food and you're actually improving the land at the same time, that's a whole new paradigm to think about your relationship to nature, and it's the most hopeful thing I've seen in the whole environmental area for a long time. There is a way -- FLATOW: He can make a living at this?  Mr. POLLAN: Yeah, and he makes a terrific living. He does a lot better than the corn farmers who are depending on government subsidies to survive or the job of their wives in town. This farm produces, it's on only 500 acres, just 100 of which are open, the rest is forest. It supports two white collar salaries and the salaries of two helpers as well. He's one of the most successful farmers in the country.  FLATOW: Because I guess, I understand from the time that you spent with these farmers who were on their tractors plowing fields of corn all day that they're not very happy about it either.  Mr. POLLAN: They're not.  FLATOW: They'd like something better.  Mr. POLLAN: They feel trapped in the system. They're all looking for alternatives. They understand that growing all this corn and soybeans to feed all these animals on feedlots is, it's not what they want to be doing. But they don't see an alternative.  You know, I said to George Naylor, this farmer in Iowa, I said, well why don't you grow something else? Here you are, you know, with this beautiful soil. And he said, what am I going to grow, broccoli? Who's going to eat the broccoli? There are no people left in Iowa, because the corn pushed them all out.  And he also, you know, he said that the elevator, the grain elevator is telling me all they want are corn and soybeans. So there's no, Iowa's a food desert. I mean, they don't feed themselves. Eighty percent of their food is imported, even though it's the breadbasket of America.  FLATOW: And you said the farmers don't even feed themselves.  Mr. POLLAN: The farmers can no longer feed themselves because their farms are no longer diversified. They used to have some chickens, they used to have some apple trees, they used to have some other crops. They used to have 14 crops, now they only have these two. And those corn and soybeans are not edible. That's feed corn. So, they cannot, it's kind of a very sad thing, that you have this food desert in the middle of Iowa.  FLATOW: You said that you're, changing topics just a bit, that you're disappointed with science journalism these days.  Mr. POLLAN: I think on the subject of nutrition. I think that they've, and it's completely well intentioned, but, you know, every new study that comes out, at least the way it gets covered by us journalists, and I count myself as one of these science journalists because that's what I do, has left the public very confused about what to eat.  The, you know, there was recently this women's health initiative that suggested that, oh, low-fat diets may not help with cancer and cardiovascular disease, and suddenly, certain people saw that headline, and I have to say it was really overplayed, the headlines and the studies didn't actually go together that well, and suddenly people were like, oh, it doesn't even matter. I might as well go back to my high-fat diet. You know, if you looked more closely, you realize the women in that study were actually not telling the truth about what they were eating, because they claimed to be eating 1500 calories a day, and to weigh 180 pounds, and I have to tell you, if they were really eating that little, they would not be weighing 180 pounds. So a lot of these nutrition studies are just faulty to begin with.  And there is an underlying cultural wisdom about food that should remain undisturbed by all the science, until the science is really good, and that is to eat a great many different things, and not too many of them. It's really simple.  FLATOW: So there's really no, forget the fad diets, forget all that stuff. Just eat a little bit of what?  Mr. POLLAN: Eat less.  FLATOW: Eat less.  Mr. POLLAN: It's the one message that is forbidden in our culture.  FLATOW: Eat less.  Mr. POLLAN: There is no money in the message eat less. But if you want to see a certifiable, scientifically verifiable finding about food, it's that the less you eat, the healthier you are, up to a point. And there is a real connection there. But, you know, eat the way, I tell people, look, if you could, you know, would your great grandmother eat this? How would she, would she recognize this as food? You're probably better off with that than any number of scientific studies.  FLATOW: Right. Should we trust organic food labeling? I mean -- Mr. POLLAN: Yes and no. Yes in that we haven't found cases of fraud, and in fact this food is grown without pesticides and in a more sustainable way than other foods. In that sense, it's a very reliable label. In this sense it's not: the image of organic food, of animals happily, you know, dairy cows grazing on grass and chickens free-ranging around the barnyard, I'm sorry to say, having visited these places, is often not the case. It's not all its cracked up to be.  Organic has gotten very industrialized too. Organic food is also soaked in fossil fuel. We are moving organic produce across the country. We're moving, you know, I spent some time in Whole Foods, and there was, you know, asparagus from Argentina on the east, in California. On the east coast here there was lettuce from the central valley of California. It takes 56 calories of fossil fuel to move one calorie of lettuce across the country to a plate in New York City.  You know, lettuce is great, salads are wonderful, but you're really paying a lot of money to ship water across the country. And, you know, that is not sustainable eating, even if it's organic.  FLATOW: Talking with Michael Pollan, author of THE OMNIVORE'S DILEMMA on TALK OF THE NATION: Science Friday on NPR News.  So this is all, this is because we want foods out of season? We want South American vegetables in the wintertime, right?  Mr. POLLAN: You're absolutely right. I mean, we are implicated in this problem. At the end of the industrial food chain has emerged a species called an industrial eater. An industrial eater is somebody who wants strawberries all year round, wants tomatoes all year round, who wants their food to be very convenient, microwavable, who wants to eat what he wants, what she wants, anytime. And that's part of the problem. He also wants to eat in the car. I mean 19 percent of our meals are eaten in the car.  FLATOW: I was going to say, there's no more sit-down meal with the family or with friends.  Mr. POLLAN: No, the family dinner is on the verge of extinction. And, I think that that's a social as well as environmental tragedy, because around the table is where we socialize our children. It's one of the most important institutions of a civilized society, is the dinner table. And, but we have food marketers convincing children that they need to eat this and that and basically, going over the head of mom and marketing to each segment of the family.  And the result is that a family dinner today, and this is a portrait I'm not painting, this is how General Mills painted it to me because they've studied this. They put cameras up in people's homes to see how they really eat. Even if they say they're eating a family dinner, well this is what it turns out they really do. Each member of the family has their single portion microwave entr\u00e9e that they're eating, you know. One kid is into pizza, another kid's into, is a vegetarian. And dad's doing the, you know, Atkins thing. And they zap their food, and the food has been designed so an eight-year-old can safely cook it.  And then they bring it to the table where poor mom is there, because she's actually cooked something because has this sense of, that's what a mom should do, I guess. And they kind of pass in the night. And they spend a few minutes overlapping, but they're not all there at the same time, and they're not eating the same thing. And why is that? Well, because when we eat something separate, we end up eating more. And when you market to that child, you're going to get more calories into that child than you would if you market to the mom and she decides this is what we should eat.  So I think the food companies, even though this may not have been their intention, deserve some of the blame for destroying the family dinner. Not to mention the fast food companies. As I said, you know, if we're eating a fifth of our meals in cars, that's an industrial eater.  So we're going to have to change our own habits before we can change this food chain. If you buy locally, if you start going to farmer's markets, you know, you're not going to find microwavable products there. You're going to have to relearn the arts of cooking. You're going to have to start sitting down to dinner again. And, all of which would be wonderful. These are very simple things we can do, and we, you know, we're told we're too busy. We're told we don't have enough money. And perhaps that's true for some people. But by and large, it's a matter of priorities. And we've been convinced that we don't have time to cook. It really doesn't take that long to make a good meal. It doesn't take three hours.  When they first started coming out with convenience foods in mixes, the industry, this was in the \u201850s, the industry really had to fight the American housewife, who said, wait a minute, this isn't drudgery. I love to cook. I get great satisfaction out of feeding my, this is one of the great satisfactions in my life. And it took years of propaganda, years of marketing, to persuade them that cooking is drudgery. It's not. It's one of the great pleasures of life.  FLATOW: The Norman Rockwell painting, right?  Mr. POLLAN: It is the Norman Rockwell painting.  FLATOW: Family around the dinner table.  Mr. POLLAN: Exactly. Around the dinner table, yeah. It's a, you know, it's a wonderful institution and it's a shame to see it in trouble. But there are very optimistic signs that it's coming back. I mean, people are rediscovering cooking. It's very interesting that we should be obsessed with chefs. Chefs are celebrities now.  FLATOW: Right. That's right.  Mr. POLLAN: And we watch the food channel and it's an odd disconnect that we're elevating cooking as a very important art form at a moment where we're doing less of it than ever before. I haven't figured that out yet.  FLATOW: Well when you do you'll come back and tell us more about it.  Mr. POLLAN: I'd be happy to.  FLATOW: Or there will be another book, I'm sure.  My guest is Michael Pollan, author of THE OMNIVORE'S DILEMMA: A NATURAL HISTORY OF FOUR MEALS. A great book, I highly recommend it to you. You know Michael Pollan's work, you know that you'll like this book. ", "section": "Science", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2006 NPR.  All rights reserved.

I'm Ira Flatow. A bit later in the hour, we'll be talking with Michael Pollan, author of a new book, THE OMNIVORE'S DILEMMA. But first, last week, two new discoveries filled in crucial gaps in the evolutionary record, and now we've got another one. Anthropologists say they have uncovered new fossils that provide the best evidence yet that Lucy -- remember our three-million-year-old ancestor, famous fossil -- well, the best evidence yet that Lucy evolved from an even older ancestor, one that lived more than four million years ago. So this new find helps fill in the million-year gap between these two groups of hominids. And amazingly, all of these fossils, all three groups that I'm talking about, were found in the same region of Ethiopia in an area called the Middle Awash. Joining me now is the co-director of the team that discovered the new fossils. Tim White is Professor of Integrative Biology, co-director of the Human Evolution Research Center, University of California at Berkeley. He joins us by phone from his office. Welcome back to Science Friday, Dr. White. Dr. TIM WHITE (University of California, Berkeley): Hello, Ira. FLATOW: How exciting is this? Is this a true missing link? You know, is that an overused word? Dr. WHITE: It's way overused. In fact, it's a link that's not missing anymore because we found it. And it's one of many we've found in this region. FLATOW: Why is that, I mentioned the three, why is that such a rich region? Dr. WHITE: Well, what's happened over the last six million years is with the rotation of the Arabian Peninsula away from Africa, a phenomenon known as plate tectonics, and the pulling of the Somali Plate away from Africa, it's resulted in a depression known as the Afar Depression or the lowlands of Ethiopia, and over six million years, lakes and rivers have been forming in this triangular depression. And as the sediment accumulates around these lakes and rivers, the plants and animals who died in that region have their remains covered and buried, and now because of the plate tectonics that continue today, these ancient sediments are brought up to the surface of the ground where we can recover the fossils of all of these organisms, including our own ancestors. FLATOW: Wow. Tell us about this ancestor, the fossils that you found. What body parts are changed? Why do you think it fits right in that missing gap there? Dr. WHITE: Well, the great thing about this place is it's become a sort of a Grand Canyon of human evolution, but instead of the Grand Canyon, which is a deep, narrow ravine with steep sides, the sediments of the Middle Awash are quite soft. And so what happens is you have the geomorphological evolution of a badland topography, and it's a desert region today, which helps us because there aren't a lot of plants around to obscure finding the fossils that come out, but then this badlands topography, we can go out and look at given time horizons, and the time horizon at 4. 1 million years ago, being almost a million years older than Lucy, is a very crucial one. And so by going out there and focusing with this big team that's an international team of scientists supported by the National Science Foundation, we've been successful at finding many different horizons. But this 4. 1 is a key one because it's the earliest species of a genus known as Australopithecus. And the teeth that we found in this species are more primitive than the ones we see in later species but more evolutionarily advanced than the ones we see in even older rocks in the same study area. So we have this ability in the Middle Awash to track human evolution through time, through six million years of time. FLATOW: So they fill in this gap between Lucy and the older ancestor. How far apart now is the gap once you put this piece in? Dr. WHITE: Well, it, every time you fill a bigger gap, it creates two smaller gaps. FLATOW: Right. Dr. WHITE: We've now created a gap in-between this species, anamensis, and an earlier one that we found at 4. 4 million years ago, a creature known as Ardipithecus ramidus, and so we have about a 300,000-year period, and the question that this discovery brings to the front is what kind of evolution happened? Was it a splitting evolution that led to this new genus and species, Australopithecus? Or did we have what we call phyletic or straight-line evolution fairly rapidly during this 300,000-year interval? And so we're able to look, because of the excellence of the evidence, we're able to look at evolution in a very fine-grained manner. FLATOW: Where does Lucy fit in to us? Is she on a direct line to us? Dr. WHITE: Well, it's probably best to think of human evolution as in three stages. There's an early stage, represented by Ardipithecus, from about four million years ago to six million years ago. That is right after our line split from the line leading to modern chimps. These are quite primitive creatures. They live in woodland environments in Eastern Africa. After four million years ago, with the evolution of the genus Australopithecus, we get a little bit of speciation. Lucy is the best known of those species of Australopithecus. She lived about 3. 2 million years ago in the same region of Ethiopia. And shortly after that, a species known as africanus, which is a sister species of the Lucy species, appears in Southern Africa, and then you have the evolution by two and a half million years ago of very specialized species of Australopithecus that eventually go extinct. So we have a little bit of radiation in that part of human evolution, but starting about two and half million years ago, we have the third phase of human evolution. That's our own. That's our own genus Homo. That phase eventually culminates in Homo sapiens, our own species, that we also found in the same mile deep stack of sediments in the Afar at about 155,000 years ago. So our own species is a relative latecomer but with clear evolutionary roots that go all the way back to six million. FLATOW: Do you, what would seal the deal on connecting, you know, filling in, as you say you created two more gaps because you put one in the middle, what do you need to find, or is, and do you think you might find it there in that great spot? Dr. WHITE: Well, I'm sure it will be found in the Afar. It's, Ethiopia's just a wonderful country, wonderful people and great geology and fossils. We have local volcanoes that give us this timeline. When you go to get this fossil evidence, you want to put it just like at a crime scene. This is not a crime scene. It's more of an evolution scene and you want to create a timeline. So by dating these volcanic rocks, we know how old things are, and we've already identified some rock bodies that go back beyond six million. We've not found hominid fossils from there yet. So that's one of the gaps that we haven't yet filled, and we're also working right now, in fact, the last field season, we were in an area of rocks that looked like they're gonna date to about 2. 7 -- actually, the rock samples are in the lab in Los Alamos and in Berkeley right now --about two and a half, 2. 7 million, and this is when our own genus originated and we see the very first stone tool technologies in the record. So this is another place we want to focus on because it's a kind of a phase transition between Australopithecus and Homo. FLATOW: Yeah, that would be post-Lucy and closer to us. Dr. WHITE: Exactly. FLATOW: Yeah. So you haven't got any tidbits you could share with us, yet. Dr. WHITE: Oh, we've got the tidbits but we like to get our dating in order and get our publications up there before we talk about these things. FLATOW: Oh, details, details. Well, I wanna thank you very much for taking time to talk with us about it, and congratulations and good luck to you, and reserve that spot for coming back next time.

I'm Ira Flatow. A bit later in the hour, we'll be talking about mercury in fish, but first, studies in animals as diverse as mice, worms, fish, have shown that when they eat a really low-calorie diet, some major illnesses like heart disease, diabetes, and some cancers, can actually be prevented and the life spans of the animals can be extended. But scientists don't fully understand why this happens and they aren't sure if they'd see the same results in people on such a calorie-restrictive diet. But, now according to a new study in the Journal of the American Medical Association, people in a six-month calorie-restriction diet, showed several improvements in health markers associated with aging. Joining us by phone to talk about the findings of the study and calorie-restriction research is my guest Dr. Eric Ravussin. He's professor at the Pennington Biomedical Research Center in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. Dr. ERIC RAVUSSIN (Chief, Division of Health and Performance Enhancement; Douglas L. Gordon Chair in Diabetes and Metabolism; Professor, Human Physiology Exercise Laboratory, Pennington Biomedical Research Center, Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana): Good afternoon, Ira. FLATOW: Thank you. How stark is it in animals? What kinds of benefits do you see in animals on these calorie-restriction diets? Dr. RAVUSSIN: I think the most spectacular, at least in rodents, is basically, they live free of cancers. Usually, mice and rats die from cancers, but if you calorie-restrict them like 30, 35, or 40 percent, compared to what they would eat normally, you see them aging longer. I mean, they look younger, even myself, I can see, you know, just the coat of the mice, for example, and especially, they stay free of cancers. And the maximum lifespan, which is basically the tenth upper percentile of those who live the longest, is really extremely expanded. FLATOW: Hmm. And you have no idea why that is? Dr. RAVUSSIN: You know, the first observation was made in the \u201830s, 1930, and, of course, there is a lot of research and there are a lot of candidate genes, there are a lot of theories. There are some that we are interested, and we started to test in humans. FLATOW: Mm hmm. And let's talk about those tests. You can't do exactly the same tests because the lifespan of a mouse is a lot shorter, isn't it? Dr. RAVUSSIN: Oh, that's true. I mean, you know, even now, there are some studies in monkeys, and monkeys live normally about 25, Rhesus monkeys, 25 to 28 years. And, of course, a study like this is already a 30 or 40 year study. Now, there are monkeys who have been for more than 15 years on calorie-restriction. Now, of course, in human, there is no way, even the NIH, not in the present time, but anyway, could sponsor a study like that. What is done is, really, to look at biomarkers of aging or longevity. FLATOW: Mm hmm. So, tell us about the study, how you set it up with people and what you found. Dr. RAVUSSIN: What we did, this first study was really the first one in non-obese humans, because there is a lot of calorie-restriction done, you know, in obese people for weight loss and so on, and those people were non-obese. And the major point of this first study was really to check if we can enroll people in such a study, can we retain them in such a study, and is that safe. Those were the three first goals of the study. But, of course, when you do a study like that which is quite long and costful, you try to put as much science as you can, and we did a lot of assessment on these people. And, ourself here, we enrolled 48 people, we randomized them blindly to four different groups. FLATOW: Mm hmm. And that was the total number that you had, so you had about 10 or 12 in each group? Dr. RAVUSSIN: We had 12 in each group. One was a control group. The other one was, you know, what we can expect to do in humans, 25 percent calorie-restriction. We carefully measured in these 48 people, by different means, we measured their energy requirement at baseline. It took us about two to three months. And then, we dropped the energy intake of these people by 25 percent in one group. Another group, we combined exercise and calorie-restriction. We dropped here, the intake, by 12 and a half percent, but also increased the level of physical activity to account for an excess energy expenditure and, therefore, they had the same energy deficit, but half by calorie restriction and half by increased exercise. And the third one was a group that I wanted to test, because there is always this question, can people adhere to such a calorie restriction. And we decided to drop the weight of these people by a low-calorie diet by 15 percent and then ask them to maintain their weight. Of course, if you maintain your weight at a lower weight, you are in the phase of calorie-restriction, because you eat less than what you needed for your original weight. FLATOW: Mm hmm. And did you get equal results in all three groups? Dr. RAVUSSIN: Not exactly. I mean, of course, this study, it was a preliminary study to embark on a longer study that we are finishing to design now, and that we hopefully start in September, and we were limited by power, of course, four groups and 12 subjects per group. But, we found differences. For example, there's no question that calorie restriction seems to bring something more than exercise, for example. And it's been shown in rodents. I mean, you can increase the activity of rodents, on average they live longer, but the maximum lifespan is not extended. FLATOW: Mm hmm. And so, tell us what kinds of results you got for these trials with people. Dr. RAVUSSIN: I think the most striking result -- I mean, there are two kinds of results. One was to look at what I said, called biomarkers of aging. You know, it can be the color of your hair, or your number of wrinkles, and so on. But there are some solid biomarkers of longevity, and those are a low insulin level, a low core temperature, or your body temperature, and an increased, what we call, DHEAS, which is a hormone secreted by the adrenal gland. And we looked at these three factors and we found that two of them were modified by calorie restrictions and the two were, your fasting insulin, independent of your weight loss, tended to decrease, and it's been shown in the Baltimore Longitudinal Aging Study to confer, you know, longer life. And, also, that the core temperature was decreased. And these two have been shown to be solid biomarkers of longevity. FLATOW: Mm hmm. Dr. RAVUSSIN: Now, the second major question was one of the theory of aging which is, one of the most accepted, but this is only one among many, is that all the aging process at the cellular level is caused by what we call free radicals, or in scientific term, reactive oxygen species. And we found that our marker, again, a damage, was reduced. In other words, there was a lower damage to your building blocks, I mean, I'm sorry, your genetic information in your DNA as a result of this six months of calorie restrictions, which I think is an important finding. FLATOW: You know, we have heard over the years, the theory that longevity also has to do with the telomeres, the little tips on the ends of the DNA there. Dr. RAVUSSIN: Yes. FLATOW: Could you study that too to see if there was a, you know, a change in that? Dr. RAVUSSIN: No, we didn't in this study. We have DNA, and we could do that, and we have talked about doing that, but in the papers that we published, we didn't do that. But, you know, the length of the telomere is really a function of how many times your cell divides. And, of course, I mean all the cells have been dividing more times. I mean, in older people, and have shorter telomere. But we didn't look at that so far. FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255 is our number. We're talking with Dr. Eric Ravussin about his study with people and the caloric intake. What will you do now? You say you're trying to put together a longer study. What would you do differently, or how would you just scale this up and do the same thing? Dr. RAVUSSIN: Yeah. I mean, like I said here, we had three different groups and we were interested in a combination of exercise and calorie restriction. We were interested in this lower energy intake. But now we have chosen one strategy, which is 25 percent of calorie restriction in many more people. And here we will work three sides together, one group in Boston, one group in St. Louis, and our self in Baton Rouge, and enroll approximately 250 people. Means it's the longest study, two years of intervention. It's a larger study, more people. We will randomize them either to this 25 percent calorie restriction, two third of them, and one third of them will serve as control. Because, I mean, a randomized trial always need a controlled group to compare with. FLATOW: What kind of calorie restriction are we talking about? Is it dramatic? I mean, what is the diet the people ate? I mean was it something they could stay on, or was it like eating twigs, and like that? Dr. RAVUSSIN: No. I mean of course, we had an outstanding psychology group as well dietary group for these studies. And you can design diets which will not cause hunger at 25 percent calorie restriction. And the trick, of course, is always to decrease the fat. You know, the calorie density is higher for fat, and therefore, the volume for the same number of calories is smaller. If you decrease the fat content, you increase the volume, having the same number of calories or less. FLATOW: How many calories did the group one have, for example? Dr. RAVUSSIN: I'm sorry? FLATOW: How many calories was that 25 percent? How many calories total did that add up to? Dr. RAVUSSIN: Let's say. . . it depends, you know. We had females and males. And for the males, maybe the baseline was, I don't have these numbers in front of me, but was about 2800 calories. Now you talk 25 percent of that, it's 560 plus 14, it's about 700 calories less than what they usually eat. That's not drastic. FLATOW: Right. Dr. RAVUSSIN: And these people were hungry in the first phase for, you know, four to six weeks. But they really got used to that. And one of the secret of this diet is there is a calorie restriction group and they are very, very emphasizing that there is a nutrition, an optimal nutrition in these diets. In other words, all the essential, you know, nutrients, as well as vitamins and all that, present in the diet and this is very important. FLATOW: Dr. Ravussin, I want to thank you for taking time to be with us. Dr. Ravussin, professor at the Pennington Biomedical Research Center in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. We're going to take a break. We'll be right back, switch gears, talk more about mercury in food, so stay with us. I'm Ira Flatow. This is TALK OF THE NATION SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.  IRA FLATOW, host:  This is TALK OF THE NATION/SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow. A bit later in the hour, we'll be talking about mercury in fish, but first, studies in animals as diverse as mice, worms, fish, have shown that when they eat a really low-calorie diet, some major illnesses like heart disease, diabetes, and some cancers, can actually be prevented and the life spans of the animals can be extended. But scientists don't fully understand why this happens and they aren't sure if they'd see the same results in people on such a calorie-restrictive diet. But, now according to a new study in the Journal of the American Medical Association, people in a six-month calorie-restriction diet, showed several improvements in health markers associated with aging. Joining us by phone to talk about the findings of the study and calorie-restriction research is my guest Dr. Eric Ravussin. He's professor at the Pennington Biomedical Research Center in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY.  Dr. ERIC RAVUSSIN (Chief, Division of Health and Performance Enhancement; Douglas L. Gordon Chair in Diabetes and Metabolism; Professor, Human Physiology Exercise Laboratory, Pennington Biomedical Research Center, Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana): Good afternoon, Ira.  FLATOW: Thank you. How stark is it in animals? What kinds of benefits do you see in animals on these calorie-restriction diets?  Dr. RAVUSSIN: I think the most spectacular, at least in rodents, is basically, they live free of cancers. Usually, mice and rats die from cancers, but if you calorie-restrict them like 30, 35, or 40 percent, compared to what they would eat normally, you see them aging longer. I mean, they look younger, even myself, I can see, you know, just the coat of the mice, for example, and especially, they stay free of cancers. And the maximum lifespan, which is basically the tenth upper percentile of those who live the longest, is really extremely expanded.  FLATOW: Hmm. And you have no idea why that is?  Dr. RAVUSSIN: You know, the first observation was made in the \u201830s, 1930, and, of course, there is a lot of research and there are a lot of candidate genes, there are a lot of theories. There are some that we are interested, and we started to test in humans.  FLATOW: Mm hmm. And let's talk about those tests. You can't do exactly the same tests because the lifespan of a mouse is a lot shorter, isn't it?  Dr. RAVUSSIN: Oh, that's true. I mean, you know, even now, there are some studies in monkeys, and monkeys live normally about 25, Rhesus monkeys, 25 to 28 years. And, of course, a study like this is already a 30 or 40 year study. Now, there are monkeys who have been for more than 15 years on calorie-restriction. Now, of course, in human, there is no way, even the NIH, not in the present time, but anyway, could sponsor a study like that. What is done is, really, to look at biomarkers of aging or longevity.  FLATOW: Mm hmm. So, tell us about the study, how you set it up with people and what you found.  Dr. RAVUSSIN: What we did, this first study was really the first one in non-obese humans, because there is a lot of calorie-restriction done, you know, in obese people for weight loss and so on, and those people were non-obese. And the major point of this first study was really to check if we can enroll people in such a study, can we retain them in such a study, and is that safe. Those were the three first goals of the study. But, of course, when you do a study like that which is quite long and costful, you try to put as much science as you can, and we did a lot of assessment on these people. And, ourself here, we enrolled 48 people, we randomized them blindly to four different groups.  FLATOW: Mm hmm. And that was the total number that you had, so you had about 10 or 12 in each group?  Dr. RAVUSSIN: We had 12 in each group. One was a control group. The other one was, you know, what we can expect to do in humans, 25 percent calorie-restriction. We carefully measured in these 48 people, by different means, we measured their energy requirement at baseline. It took us about two to three months. And then, we dropped the energy intake of these people by 25 percent in one group. Another group, we combined exercise and calorie-restriction. We dropped here, the intake, by 12 and a half percent, but also increased the level of physical activity to account for an excess energy expenditure and, therefore, they had the same energy deficit, but half by calorie restriction and half by increased exercise. And the third one was a group that I wanted to test, because there is always this question, can people adhere to such a calorie restriction. And we decided to drop the weight of these people by a low-calorie diet by 15 percent and then ask them to maintain their weight. Of course, if you maintain your weight at a lower weight, you are in the phase of calorie-restriction, because you eat less than what you needed for your original weight.  FLATOW: Mm hmm. And did you get equal results in all three groups?  Dr. RAVUSSIN: Not exactly. I mean, of course, this study, it was a preliminary study to embark on a longer study that we are finishing to design now, and that we hopefully start in September, and we were limited by power, of course, four groups and 12 subjects per group. But, we found differences. For example, there's no question that calorie restriction seems to bring something more than exercise, for example. And it's been shown in rodents. I mean, you can increase the activity of rodents, on average they live longer, but the maximum lifespan is not extended.  FLATOW: Mm hmm. And so, tell us what kinds of results you got for these trials with people.  Dr. RAVUSSIN: I think the most striking result -- I mean, there are two kinds of results. One was to look at what I said, called biomarkers of aging. You know, it can be the color of your hair, or your number of wrinkles, and so on. But there are some solid biomarkers of longevity, and those are a low insulin level, a low core temperature, or your body temperature, and an increased, what we call, DHEAS, which is a hormone secreted by the adrenal gland. And we looked at these three factors and we found that two of them were modified by calorie restrictions and the two were, your fasting insulin, independent of your weight loss, tended to decrease, and it's been shown in the Baltimore Longitudinal Aging Study to confer, you know, longer life. And, also, that the core temperature was decreased. And these two have been shown to be solid biomarkers of longevity.  FLATOW: Mm hmm.  Dr. RAVUSSIN: Now, the second major question was one of the theory of aging which is, one of the most accepted, but this is only one among many, is that all the aging process at the cellular level is caused by what we call free radicals, or in scientific term, reactive oxygen species. And we found that our marker, again, a damage, was reduced. In other words, there was a lower damage to your building blocks, I mean, I'm sorry, your genetic information in your DNA as a result of this six months of calorie restrictions, which I think is an important finding.  FLATOW: You know, we have heard over the years, the theory that longevity also has to do with the telomeres, the little tips on the ends of the DNA there.  Dr. RAVUSSIN: Yes.  FLATOW: Could you study that too to see if there was a, you know, a change in that?  Dr. RAVUSSIN: No, we didn't in this study. We have DNA, and we could do that, and we have talked about doing that, but in the papers that we published, we didn't do that. But, you know, the length of the telomere is really a function of how many times your cell divides. And, of course, I mean all the cells have been dividing more times. I mean, in older people, and have shorter telomere. But we didn't look at that so far.  FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255 is our number. We're talking with Dr. Eric Ravussin about his study with people and the caloric intake. What will you do now? You say you're trying to put together a longer study. What would you do differently, or how would you just scale this up and do the same thing?  Dr. RAVUSSIN: Yeah. I mean, like I said here, we had three different groups and we were interested in a combination of exercise and calorie restriction. We were interested in this lower energy intake. But now we have chosen one strategy, which is 25 percent of calorie restriction in many more people. And here we will work three sides together, one group in Boston, one group in St. Louis, and our self in Baton Rouge, and enroll approximately 250 people. Means it's the longest study, two years of intervention. It's a larger study, more people. We will randomize them either to this 25 percent calorie restriction, two third of them, and one third of them will serve as control. Because, I mean, a randomized trial always need a controlled group to compare with.  FLATOW: What kind of calorie restriction are we talking about? Is it dramatic? I mean, what is the diet the people ate? I mean was it something they could stay on, or was it like eating twigs, and like that?  Dr. RAVUSSIN: No. I mean of course, we had an outstanding psychology group as well dietary group for these studies. And you can design diets which will not cause hunger at 25 percent calorie restriction. And the trick, of course, is always to decrease the fat. You know, the calorie density is higher for fat, and therefore, the volume for the same number of calories is smaller. If you decrease the fat content, you increase the volume, having the same number of calories or less.  FLATOW: How many calories did the group one have, for example?  Dr. RAVUSSIN: I'm sorry?

Teflon, that new ubiquitous non-stick coating, has made cooking easier for generations of Americans. It's also made a lot of money for its inventor, DuPont. Now, a class action lawsuit charges that Teflon has done something else; posed a health risk to consumers. The company denies that, and NPR's Kathleen Schalch reports. KATHLEEN SCHALCH reporting: The case centers on what happens when you heat up a Teflon pan. DuPont says, nothing. David Boothe is global business manager for DuPont Teflon Products. Mr. DAVID BOOTHE (Global Business Manager, DuPont Teflon Products): This cookware has been used safely by millions of people for over 40 years. And, DuPont believes strongly, and that's backed up not just by us but by peer-reviewed science and other government agencies, that it is safe. SCHALCH: But attorneys for the plaintiffs in this case say Teflon coated cookware can give off toxic fumes and particles. Alan Kluger, of the Miami Law firm, Kluger, Peretz, Kaplan, & Berlin, is lead counsel in the case. Kluger says, decades ago, DuPont asked volunteers to smoke cigarettes laced with Teflon. Mr. ALAN KLUGER (Attorney, Kluger, Peretz, Kaplan, & Berlin): And these experiments found that fumes from the heated Teflon made people sick. These studies were begun in the 1950s. SCHALCH: He says DuPont has also known for a long time that fumes from overheated Teflon can kill pet birds, and he says the company should have warned consumers that non-stick coatings can be hazardous. Mr. KLUGER: if the consumer, after having knowledge of the risk, wants to use the product anyway, you know, they can do that. But it's not up to DuPont to make that decision. SCHALCH: Kluger and the other attorneys are asking for $5,000,000,000. They want DuPont to issue warnings and refunds to consumers who want to exchange their non-stick cookware for something else. The dispute hinges, in part, on how you assume people will use their non-stick cookware. Tim Kropp, a scientist at Environmental Working Group, says overheating it does carry some risk. Dr. TIM KROPP (Toxicologist, Environmental Working Group): Non-stick cookware, when heated either under a broiler or on a stovetop at medium-high heat, can, within six minutes, get to temperatures that will release toxic particles and gasses. SCHALCH: Especially if there's little or no food or liquid in the pan to absorb the heat. But David Boothe at DuPont says this is extremely rare. Mr. BOOTHE: The studies show that we don't start to see significant decomposition of that coating until about 660 degrees Fahrenheit, which is very hot. You're going to see smoke and fumes from cooking oil, fats, or butter well before that period of time. In fact, things are going to happen, like the handles are going to melt. SCHALCH: Birds are so sensitive, he says, that fumes from an overheated pan can indeed kill them. People are more resilient, Boothe says. Mr. BOOTHE: We only have, or know of, one documented case of apparent illness from exposure to fluoropolymer-coated cookware. This person apparently had some minor flu-like symptoms that disappeared in 24-hours. SCHALCH: It's not clear whether breathing fumes from overheated non-stick cookware has any long-term consequences in humans. Tim Kropp, of Environmental Working Group, says that should, at least, be studied. Still, cookware isn't Kropp's biggest worry. There is a Teflon-related chemical, called PFOA, found in most Americans' bodies, and listed by the EPA as a likely human carcinogen. Chemicals that might turn into PFOA are found in common household products. Dr. KROPP: All the way from popcorn bag packaging to stain defender coatings for clothing to keep stains off of pants and make them easy to wash. SCHALCH: PFOA is also used to manufacture non-stick cookware. It helps spread the Teflon coating evenly. But afterwards, it's removed; so scientists don't view cookware as the culprit. Dr. KROPP: It's not the source of the chemicals that are found in our bodies. It's not the source of the chemicals that the EPA and the FDA are investigating. SCHALCH: That hasn't deterred plaintiffs' attorneys. More than a dozen attorneys, representing about 70 clients, are gathering in Des Moines tomorrow for a pre-trial hearing Thursday.

I'm Ira Flatow. Take a few select notes, add an envelope, some harmonics, and just the right timbre. Now let that vibrate your basilar membrane. What do you have? Beethoven's Ninth, of course. This hour, a look at the physics of music. Why does a violin sound different from a clarinet? What makes a sound musical while another is just noise? From the shape of your ear canal to the wave properties of sound, physics can tell us a lot about music. We'll talk about it with the help of some ancient bassoons, Tuvan throat singers, and a lesson in building a brass instrument. It's all coming up after this break. Stay with us. (Soundbite of News) IRA FLATOW, host: This is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow. This hour, we're alive coming to you from the Exploratorium in San Francisco. And what better place to explore the intersection of art and science than the Exploratorium, a terrific science museum and place to experiment here in San Francisco. And this hour, we're gonna take a look at the disciplines that aren't usually talked about together, but are very much related. And I'm talking about physics and music. We can, what can one teach about the other? And we can know something about physics, what would you know about music? Can you explain music scientifically? Can knowing a little about the science of music enhance your appreciation of it? I certainly think so, and I'm hoping by the end of the hour, you will, too. And you'll see why because we're gonna have a lot of fun this hour. We're lucky to be here in California, always on the cutting edge. Several universities in the state are offering courses that look at the physics of music. I'm going to be joined here by three physicists who teach or have taught such a class. Maybe you can start one in your own university or your high school after you hear about what they do in their physics classes. Bryant Hichwa is a professor of physics and astronomy at Sonoma State University in Rohnert Park, California. Thanks for being with us today. Dr. BRYANT HICHWA (Sonoma State University): Good to be here. FLATOW: David Kirby, Kirkby is associate professor of physics at the University of California in Irvine. Welcome to Science Friday. Dr. DAVID KIRKBY (University of California, Irvine): Thanks, Ira. FLATOW: And Brian Holmes is professor of physics at San Jose State University. Thank you for being with us today, Brian. Dr. BRIAN HOLMES (San Jose State University): Hi, Ira. FLATOW: Hi, there. Let me begin with you by talking to Dr. Hichwa. Why teach this course? What do students get out of a course like this? Dr. HICHWA: Well, besides being fun to teach a course like this, we find that a lot of students today have a real phobia about math and science. And in the technological world that we live in, it's really important that students not fear science and math. And so, we use this type of a course to really get to the students and, you know, use the mechanism of teaching music, the scientific aspect of music, to get to the physics. FLATOW: So do they view this as music, a music teacher teaching physics or a music to learn physics, a physics to learn music? Dr. HICHWA: Well, you always have to take it from the music perspective, because you gotta get the--you gotta get them interested in the class. And by the way, you sneak in a little bit of physics as you go along. (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: Are you the same way, Dr. Kirkby? Do you think the same thing about--the same view about teaching physics and music? Do you use the music as a means of teaching physics? Dr. KIRKBY: Well, the class I teach is definitely a physics class. FLATOW: Yeah. Dr. KIRKBY: I get students from all over campus taking it. Not, particularly, a lot of musicians taking it. FLATOW: Hmm. And why did you begin to teach this course? Something that you, in your background, told you this would be useful? Dr. KIRKBY: Yeah, I had a really hard time deciding whether to do music or physics as a career, and. . . FLATOW: Really? Dr. KIRKBY: Of course everyone told me to do physics. FLATOW: Music. Physics. (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. KIRKBY: Right. So this was an opportunity to actually bring music back into my career, to teach this course, so. FLATOW: Mm hmm. And Brian Holmes, you certainly demonstrate a lot of music and physics. Dr. HOLMES: Well, I'm, again, a person who failed to make an adequate choice between physics and music, and so I try to do both. FLATOW: Mm hmm. Dr. HOLMES: I think the expression you're looking for is master of none. (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: Well, it's good to be--it's, I would say, it's eclectic. You have a little bit of knowledge in all different kinds of areas. I'd rather look at it that way. Dr. HOLMES: Yes, and I think it gives a, me a lot of credibility that I can function as a professional musician. Musicians are rightfully skeptical of what scientists tell them, unless you understand that both scientists and musicians have their own useful points of view. Often they use the same words and mean different things, and so it's helpful to cross that divide. FLATOW: Well, that's a good place to start our little music education course here today on SCIENCE FRIDAY because let's talk about how science informs us about music. First, let's talk about what is the difference between noise and music, David Kirkby, What makes a sound musical, versus nonmusical? Dr. KIRKBY: Well, I think you get a very different answer depending on who you ask. Well, let me answer that question as a physicist. So I think there's really three essential qualities for a musical sound: pitch, envelope and timbre. FLATOW: Mm hmm. Dr. KIRKBY: So I have some examples here, actually, so I can. . . FLATOW: All right, let's go to example number one. Dr. KIRKBY: So let me play you an example. So this is sounds which only have that first quality, pitch. And it's, you're gonna hear a recognizable melody, but it won't sound very musical. (Soundbite of music with pitch) Dr. KIRBY: OK, so you recognize the melody there, and so that's. . . (Soundbite of music with pitch) Dr. KIRBY:. . . very. So pitch is the quality that really makes a melody possible. FLATOW: Mm hmm. Dr. KIRKBY: It's what musicians, it's how musicians identify notes like C sharp or B flat. FLATOW: So you have the notes, but you don't have music yet. Dr. KIRKBY: Right, you don't have music yet. And what is pitch? Well, it's, when you're talking about sound, it's always difficult because it's an abstract thing, You can't see sounds. So I like to think of it--a musical note is like dropping a stone in a pond. And that creates a set of ripples that spread out in circles, and those ripples are a wave, and that's just like. . . FLATOW: Right. Dr. KIRKBY: . . . a wave of sound. The difference is that with music, they're ripples that's sloshing back and forth of air, instead of water. And pitch is just a measurement of how often those waves reach your eardrum. FLATOW: So what do you have to add now? Dr. KIRKBY: So, right, to make it more musical. . . FLATOW: Yeah. Dr. KIRKBY: . . . we need to add those other two ingredients: envelope and the timbre. So the envelope is really describing the height of those waves as they reach you. In the sample you just heard, it wasn't very musical: the waves all reached you with exactly the same height. So it started abruptly, it was a very monotonous sound, and it ended abruptly. And one of the ways you recognize different instruments is that--a percussion instrument like a xylophone or a marimba, it ends--it begins very abruptly and then dies off very quickly. Whereas a saxophone, it takes a little bit of breathe to get the reed going. So let me play you an example. This is the same sample but now with the envelope of a, well, of a saxophone. (Soundbite of music with pitch and a saxophone envelope) Dr. KIRKBY: And compare that with a different envelope. (Soundbite of music with pitch and a marimba envelope) Dr. KIRKBY: So here, so there you--the only difference there was the shaping of the sound. We had the two ingredients: the pitch, which allows you to have different notes. . . FLATOW: Right. Dr. KIRKBY: And then we had the shaping of the envelope, and that's one of the ways that you tell the difference. FLATOW: What was that other, what was that second? Dr. KIRKBY: The second one was a marimba. FLATOW: A marimba. Dr. KIRKBY: Yeah. FLATOW: So you put the marimba envelope on top of that. Dr. KIRKBY: Right, right. FLATOW: So now let's talk about the timbre. Dr. KIRKBY: Right, the timbre is really the most complicated and the most difficult to talk about. It's really the quality of that's left over when we take out all of the elements that we know how to quantify. It's a bit like trying to describe a fine wine\u2026 FLATOW: Mm. Dr. KIRKBY: \u2026the kind of words you have to use. But to a physicist, the timbre is a result of--when you hear a musical sound, you're not really hearing a simple vibration. It's not--the picture I gave you of a wave is not really accurate. The vibrations that reach your ear are very complicated, and they're actually a superposition of many vibrations. They're over--what musicians call overtones--and it's the way each instrument has a unique fingerprint, which is the recipe of those overtones that make up its sound. So to illustrate that, I have a sample here, where we're gonna hear--we'll hear just to begin with a pure sound, the electronic equivalent to a tuning fork. And then we're gonna add additional tuning forks to create the sound of an instrument which you'll probably recognize as an organ. (Soundbite of music) FLATOW: Wow. Do you mean you took all those, you took those pure sounds together and add them up, and you get\u2026 Dr. KIRBY: Exactly FLATOW: A totally different sounding\u2026 Dr. KIRKBY: Right. So it's amazing. And that's really what gives--what gives each instrument it's unique color. That recipe or finger print, that recipe of overtones that make it up. And the amazing thing is that when you hear all those tuning forks played together, if they have the right relationships between their frequencies, your brain actually assimilates it into one note. You're not aware of hearing 20 different tuning forks playing at once. You just, you just have a perception of an organ. FLATOW: Um hmm. And Bryant Hichwa, is that in all cultures, work the same way? I mean, we tend to think of music as cultural entity. Is it possible to define music scientifically, using physics? Have we broken this down too much, and say, Well, you're not enjoying the music any more, you know. We've shown you these little pitches--can't we just enjoy it for what it is? Prof. HICHWA: Well, if we go back and look, historically, scales developed over the course of many years. And as we moved into the modern era, we found that as we played different musical instruments together, they didn't sound very good. And from a scientific prospective, we took our scale and we divided it up into twelve equal parts. So, from a scientific perspective, yes we can--we can look at all the notes, we can quantify them in terms of their frequencies, or pitch--but again, you know, it's that perception that's important. So yes, we can look at it from a scientific perspective, but it's the musical perspective, I think, that wins out. FLATOW: Brian, any comments on it? Dr. HOLMES: One thing that's always interested me is that Galileo's father, Vincenzo Galilei, was a composer and a significant lute player. And he was very concerned about the mathematics of harmony. He may have been the first European to propose equal temperament. And it was in his experiments with the vibrations of the string, that may have taught Galileo, himself, some of the virtues of the experimental method. So I think there's a very direct tie between music and science, there. FLATOW: Un huh. You think that this was always at the back of their minds, some sort of explanation. Dr. HOLMES: Yes, I think that you find that people who deal with music theory often have a very strong technical bent. They're interested in math, they have, they work on very fine details. FLATOW: Um hum. David, do you agree? Dr. KIRKBY: Yeah, there's a surprising number of--not just physicists, but all types of scientist--who really, who have strong connections in music and strong backgrounds. FLATOW: Um hum. Does your brain actually manipulate sound? Dr. KIRKBY: It definitely does. But the--I was just telling you how the overtones build the fingerprint of each instrument. And you're not aware of all those overtones individually. The signals are going into your brain, but your brain, helpfully, reduces all of that information into just a perception of a single note. FLATOW: We're going to come back and talk lots more about music, and have a great demonstration from Brian about how to build a brass instrument. I'd like you to encourage you here in the audience at the Exploratorium to step up to the mike, and maybe you have some musical questions about music and science you'd like to ask, and our number here, on the phone, as always is 1-800-989-8255. So get ready to have a musical interlude when we come back. Stay with us. (Soundbite of music) FLATOW: You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION: Science Friday. I'm Ira Flatow. We're talking this hour about the physics of music with my guests Bryant Hichwa, professor of physics and astronomy at Sonoma State University, David Kirkby, associate professor of physics at University of California Irvine, Bryan Holmes, professor of physics at San Jose State University, and Dr. Holmes is on his way to help us build a brass instrument. But just to warm us up before we get right to that, I want to just go over a little bit of a subject I was talking with Dr. Kirkby before about our brain manipulating sound. Give us an example. I know you have an example of virtual pitch that you can play for us. Dr. KIRKBY: Ok, yes. The question there--a way of framing the question is why is it you can hear the lowest note on the piano? Because the frequency of the lowest note, if you look it up, is actually something below what most people can hear. And the reason is, it's all of those overtones. When you strike that lowest note on the piano, you're really exciting many other overtones, and so your brain is--even though you're not actually able to hear the fundamental, really the foundation of the sound--your brain extrapolates and fills it in. So I'm going to play you an example. And so this is the same Bach Invention, where I've removed the foundation of the sounds. So it's a bit like watching someone walk down the stairs. When they're at the top of the stairs you see them. You know they're standing on their feet. As they walk down you can't see their feet any more. But your brain fills in the blanks, and seems they're still there. And so it's the analogy of that. So here we go. (Soundbite of music) Dr. KIRKBY: Sorry. FLATOW: Modern Technology again, bites us. (Soundbite of music) Dr. KIRKBY: Okay, I'm going to give up on that one. FLATOW: We'll come back to that. That's nature's way of telling us that Brian Holmes is ready to come and talk to us about a demonstration. Quite interesting one. What I want you to listen to this very carefully. It's on how to build a brass instrument. Dr. Holmes, I presume. Dr. HOLMES: Yes. First off, I need to clarify an issue. When you play a brass instrument, in the English language we say you blow a trumpet, but blowing is really inadequate. I'm going to blow a trumpet, but you'll hear (Sound of blowing in trumpet) Dr. HOLMES: It doesn't produce a result. You have to put some sound into it, and so I'm going to, you have to buzz your lips (Sound of buzzing lips) Dr. HOLMES: to get the result. And I'll do that into the trumpet, and then I'll take the trumpet away from my mouth and you'll hear me buzz. (Sound of trumpet & lips buzzing) FLATOW: Oh, so you have to do that buzzing? Dr. HOLMES: You got to do that. So every time you hear a trumpet player, you admire, their going (sound of lips buzzing) right at you. (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: So, but that's a real trumpet. You have in your hand some interesting looking plumbing. If I might describe it. Dr. HOLMES: Yes. You might describe it that way. I have a tube which is made out of trumpet playing tube It's trumpet make--trumpet tube. It's about a quarter of an inch in diameter. Same diameter as a trumpet. And it's 141 centimeters long, so this is a tube just as long as a trumpet, but it doesn't have a flared bell on the end. FLATOW: It looks like about a half inch in diameter. Would I say? That's about right? Dr. HOLMES: Yeah. FLATOW: It's a tube a half inch in diameter. Dr. HOLMES: Sure. So I'm going to buzz my lips into this, and you'll hear that it likes certain notes. So here goes. (Sound of trumpet) Dr. HOLMES: Now does that sound like a trumpet to you? FLATOW: Something you hear at the ball game, I think. It sounds more like\u2026 Dr. HOLMES: Well, yes, but how does it sound different from a trumpet? FLATOW: Well, it doesn't have a ring to it. Dr. HOLMES: Yeah, and it's also not very loud. FLATOW: Right Dr. HOLMES: It's also out of tune. FLATOW: All those things. Dr. HOLMES: But that's true of most trumpets, so\u2026 If you could hear me try to do a bugle call. FLATOW: Let me let you stand back so you get a better shot at the microphone so you can hear it. Dr. HOLMES: Okay. (Sound of tube being played) FLATOW: The horses almost came to the gate on that one. Dr. HOLMES: No, I think they're still where they can get some nice food. So, in order to turn this into a trumpet, the first thing I would, got to try to do is to put a bell on it. This is a flared tapered bell. It's the big end of the trumpet. And I can do this by replacing a cylindrical piece of tubing with the bell. And so, when I put this on, the bell acts a little bit as a megaphone. It means that more energy gets into the room. And so when I sound it like this, I want you to hear how it sounds. (Sound of tube with bell being played) FLATOW: We're getting closer. Dr. HOLMES: It's a little closer. It's louder, and it's also getting more high frequency energy into the room. What you might not have noticed is that the pitch is also changed. This thing is actually more in tune than it was before. But it's still not a trumpet. Do you know what you find at the front end of the trumpet? FLATOW: The mouthpiece. Dr. HOLMES: No, you find a trumpet player. FLATOW: (Unintelligible) boom-bing. Dr. HOLMES: Sorry. That's a little musicians' joke there. At the front end of the trumpet you have a mouthpiece, which has a hemispherical cup that's maybe a half an inch across and half an inch deep. FLATOW: Right Dr. HOLMES: When I buzz my lips like this (buzz of lips), and then when I do it into the mouthpiece (buzz through mouthpiece), it sounds a lot buzzier, it sounds a lot edgier. And the reason is that this cup acts like a coke bottle. When you blow across the top of a coke bottle, you hear a certain sound. Well, the mouthpiece of a trumpet really loves sounds near 800 cycles per second. And those are amplified. That's the difference between this sound (buzz of lips) and this sound (buzz through mouthpiece). And so when I put this on the front end of the trumpet, you expect it to have this edgier sound. But there's another--So I'm now assembling it. It's still 141 centimeters long, but now it has a mouthpiece on the front end, and it has a bell. (Sound of trumpet) FLATOW: Very nice. And it looks like, now, one of those trumpets that we're use to seeing. Dr. HOLMES: Yes. But this tells you why you have to have a bell on a trumpet. Why you have to have a mouthpiece. And why they never design trumpets with holes in the sides. Woodwinds, like clarinets and flutes, have holes in the sides to get different notes. But if you put a hole in the side of a trumpet, that doesn't work out at all, and I have carefully engineered a trumpet here. So I can demonstrate that. FLATOW: And while you're getting that ready, that trumpet that you have has no valves on it, either. You were making all those notes just with your lips, right? Dr. HOLMES: Yeah. I buzzed my lips (buzz through lips), and the instrument chooses the notes that is likes. (arpeggio on trumpet) FLATOW: We're tuning up here. Dr. HOLMES: Right. So this is what a trumpet would sound like if there were holes in the side. And I've done this with a real trumpet and I've removed the second valve tuning slide. Here's the instrument with the sound coming out the bell. ( playing trumpet) Now coming out the hole in the side (Playing trumpet with hole) If you wanted to base your trumpet on holes in the side, this might be the way it would sound. (playing trumpet with hole) FLATOW: Not very satisfying trumpets Dr. HOLMES: Not very satisfying. And so, the purpose of valves on a trumpet is to extend the length of the instrument. And that causes the sounds to be lower in pitch, but the sounds are still being processed by the bell. And so they have the trumpet-like character. FLATOW: Who decided to put valves on a trumpet? If you were playing it so well without, you know, just with your mouth making the sounds, why have the valves? Who discovered or say, hey, this is a good idea? Dr. HOLMES: Well, I was playing well, Ira, and I thank you for that. But the problem is, I couldn't play very much. And as a trumpet player, I object to that. Listen, there are only five or six notes. (playing trumpet) Dr. HOLMES: And so the only jobs you're qualified for are jobs at racetracks. But if you can have valves, then you can get all the notes in between the notes that were the open notes. FLATOW: So the valves don't open holes up in the trumpet. You said they extend or they\u2026 Dr. HOLMES: They extend the length of the tubing. For example I'm going to play a pattern of notes. And then I'm going to play with the first valve down. The first valve extends the length of the instrument by 12 percent. And that will lower all the pitches by 12 percent. So here's without the valves, and then with the first valve. (playing trumpet) Dr. HOLMES: It's the same pattern, but all the frequencies have been lowered by a set amount. And because there are three valves, then I can get all the notes in between the open notes of the instrument. FLATOW: You know that old song, you know, I push this button down here and the music goes round and round, you know the rest of the song, and comes out here. Dr. HOLMES: Well, the music does go round and round. And you might think that the sound comes out the bell, but what's really interesting is, when the sound reaches the bell, most of it reflects and stays inside the instrument. Only two percent of the energy leaks out. FLATOW: Two percent. Dr. HOLMES: Only two percent. You may think that my trumpet playing is really loud. But be really grateful that you're not some tiny insect living inside the instrument\u2026 FLATOW: Wow. Dr. HOLMES: \u2026where the sound is much louder. But in fact, the fact that so little of the sound goes into the room is why a trumpet is playable because the sound goes to the bell and it reflects back to my lips. My lips are always being bombarded by high and low pressure puffs of air, and this controls the frequency of my lips. And this control enables the oscillating standing wave inside the instrument to draw more energy from my lips. FLATOW: So only two percent of it, wow. Is that an efficient instrument? Are most instruments, or other brass instruments, the same way--work in the same way? Dr. HOLMES: Most brass instruments are that way. Typically, as they go to higher frequencies, they are more efficient projectors of sound. And so you could say that the bell is a high-pass filter, or to be less technical, a bell is like turning on the treble knob on your stereo; it causes more high frequency stuff to come out of the instrument. FLATOW: Why do some instruments then have the holes in them and others don't have the holes in the them? Dr. HOLMES: Well, flutes and clarinets are instruments which are cylindrical in their profile. So if you open a hole in the side of the cylinder, it's still a cylinder in shape. The trumpet has a cylindrical section but then a flared end. If you open a hole in the side, you're going to get rid of the flared end and you're going to change its shape. But the woodwinds work because, by opening holes in the side, you don't change the shapes of them. FLATOW: Is this the ultimate shape a trumpet should be or could be? Could you make a trumpet better or work differently? Dr. HOLMES: Well, trumpet players will give you lots of arguments on that score. And indeed, for certain kinds of music and for certain kinds of use, players will choose different instruments. They have vivid opinions. And what to us, as physicists, would seem to be remarkably miniscule and insignificant details are lifeblood for a professional musician. FLATOW: So what's your take on building, you know, a trumpet from scratch? Can anybody do this thing? Can you change other parts now, if you wanted to make it sound differently? Dr. HOLMES: Yes, you can replace the bell with a bell of a different flare. But if you want to do this at home, get yourself a length of garden hose, take a trumpet mouthpiece, wrap it with electrical tape, put it one end and put a funnel in the other end. You'll get a pretty good working brass instrument and not have to spend a lot of money. (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: Well, thank you very much for this demonstration. It was just terrific. Let's go back to Dr. Kirkby and see if he's got his sound, the note that the brain is going to put there that's not really there. You've got that\u2026 Dr. KIRKBY: Let's give that a try. FLATOW: Explain again what you are going to be demonstrating. Dr. KIRKBY: Well, it's the audio analogy of someone walking down the stairs. And when you hear a note, what your brain tells you about it is the only foundation; basically their feet is what your perception is of. But as they walk down the stairs, you still know their feet are there even though you can't see it. So this is the equivalent, I hope. (Soundbite of music) Dr. KIRKBY: Nope. (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: I love live radio. We'll give you one more shot and then we'll go to the phones. 1-800-989-8255 is our number. Go ahead. Do you want to try it again? Dr. KIRKBY: All right. FLATOW: Go ahead. (Soundbite of music) Dr. KIRKBY: Okay, so why don't I actually explain what you are hearing instead. FLATOW: Okay. Dr. KIRKBY: So this is an auditory illusion. Illusions are a great way to learn about how the brain works--optical illusions. And people don't often realize that there's also auditory illusions. And so this is not a real instrument. It's not an instrument that you could ever build because it has overtones that your brain's not used to hearing. So your brain doesn't do a good job of figuring out what the pitch is. And so this is a scale. Brian was talking about scales. And it's the same scale repeating over and over. But your perception is of a scale that keeps on rising forever and ever. So it's a bit like that Escher lithograph\u2026 FLATOW: Right. Right. Dr. KIRKBY: \u2026of the ascending, descending. So let's hear that. (Soundbite of music) FLATOW: That's not descending and rising? It's\u2026 Dr. KIRKBY: No, it's just keeps on going. It's the same scale repeating over and over\u2026 FLATOW: Wow. Dr. KIRKBY: \u2026just playing the same 12 notes. But you have a perception--because we're really playing with your brain. Your brain is used to hearing certain patterns of overtones that occur in nature, the ones that you get in pipes, for example. FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255 is our number. We're talking about the physics of music this hour on TALK OF THE NATION: Science Friday. I'm Ira Flatow here at the Exploratorium in San Francisco. Let's go to the phones and see what some of our listeners have got to say. Scott(ph) in Kalamazoo, very musical sounding city, is it not? SCOTT (Caller): Indeed it is. Good afternoon. This is a topic that's near and dear to my heart. I'm a piano technician. And so I deal with all sorts of physics-related things every day in my work. There are some real interesting physics involved with the sound of the piano and different pianos having to do with the length and thickness of the strings in various pianos and how that affects the sound of the piano and how the piano's tuned, because every piano is different. This is called the scaling of the piano is the scheme that they use to determine, for a given piano, the size of the strings. And because that's different in every piano, every piano is tuned differently. And that's, in a nutshell, why it takes a professional to be able to do a good job at tuning a piano because it involves a lot of training and listening to the overtones that you've been talking about and getting those to match up so that they sound good in that particular instrument. FLATOW: So you just can't stick a little meter on the piano. You need a real human ear to listen to it. SCOTT: Well, to a degree, yes. They, in the last, oh, I don't know, 10 or 15 years, they have actually invented a very advanced electronic--several different electronic tuning devices that are specific to pianos that basically they've developed to the point where they can electronically listen to these overtones in a similar way to how human ear listens to them and get the piano sounding pretty good. But even with using those very advanced instruments, it still takes a human ear that knows what to listen for in order to confirm that the machine is really telling you where to put the string. FLATOW: David Kirkby, agree? Dr.  KIRKBY: Oh, yes, I definitely agree. I mean, you raise an interesting point about the material that's used for the strings, because, if you think about this, the piano covers many octaves. So if the strings were all identical, the notes--the strings that you hit when you play a low note would have to be several hundred times longer than the ones you play for the short notes. So it wouldn't fit in the living room anymore. And so, in fact, if you look inside a piano, you'll see that the low notes, the strings are much thicker and they even have a material wound around them. FLATOW: Yeah, I've--having grown up with a piano, I have wondered that quite often about why they sound so different. We're going to talk lots more about the physics of music and sound and take more of your questions right here at the Exploratorium in San Francisco. I'm Ira Flatow. Stay with us. We'll be right back after this short break. (Soundbite of TALK OF THE NATION theme) You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION: Science Friday. I'm Ira Flatow. We're talking this hour about the physics of music, coming to you from San Francisco in the Exploratorium with my guests, Bryant Hichwa, professor of physics and astronomy at Sonoma State University; David Kirkby, associate professor of physics at the University of California Irvine; Brian Holmes, professor of physics at San Jose State University. Our number, 1-800-989-8255. Let's go to the floor here.  Yes, sir. GEORGE(ph) (Audience Member): Hi. My name is George Krenin(ph) from Belmont, about 25 miles down the peninsula from here. Earlier, Dr. Holmes, when he was talking about why some wind instruments have holes in the side and some don't, he said that a distinguishing feature was the presence of a bell. But saxophones have bells and they have holes in the side; clarinets have bells and holes in the side. And I was wondering if Dr. Holmes could expand on that or explain. Dr. HOLMES: One short answer to your question was I lied. (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: There you have it. First person to ever admit they lied on Science Friday in public. Dr. HOLMES: The second answer\u2026 FLATOW: Many have but never admit it. But go ahead. Dr. HOLMES: Yes. The second answer is that a saxophone is pretty much all bell. The flare that you notice in a saxophone is primarily right at the very end. And so the bell is not nearly as long as it is for a trumpet. A clarinet also has a bell. And the reason is a rather complex one, but when you have--when you're playing a clarinet and you have a bunch of holes open, the sound is coming not just out of the first open hole but out of the group of open holes, and that causes a lot of high frequency energy to be admitted by the row of holes. If you have all the holes closed, as you do for the lowest note, then you're not going to get that projection of high frequency sound unless you put a bell on it which simulates the effect of having a row of holes. You could have a perfectly cylindrical clarinet without a bell if you put two or three extra holes at the end that you never used. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Let's talk--let's listen to some more musical samples. Dr. Hichwa, we have some musical samples to listen to. Let's talk about what you have. Dr. HICHWA: Okay, the first one is the Tuvan throat singer. FLATOW: What is the -- tell us what Tuvan throat singers, what that is, what we're listening to. Dr. HICHWA: In Middle Asia there's a culture there that people sing these very, very low notes. And in all of these cultures, the way that they do this is that--they play a lute-like instrument and it makes a low frequency. And then they listen to that and it's a biofeedback process. They begin singing and matching the pitch that they're hearing. And what they have to do is that they have to change the cavities in their throat and their mouth. And normally, you know, we have a pharynx, the throat cavity in our mouth, which projects the different frequencies that you hear. What they have to do is that they have to open up that opening between the throat and the mouth to make one continuous cavity. And so that's what they're doing. It's a very\u2026 FLATOW: That's a talent, a real talent. Dr. HICHWA: \u2026real very, very difficult to do. FLATOW: All right. We're going to hear some Tuvan throat singing with--it's called Step Cargera(ph), I think, is the name. Right? Correct? Correct me if I'm wrong. And the artist is Fedore Kao(ph). And let's hear that clip now. (Soundbite of Step Cargera) FLATOW: Wow. Dr. HICHWA: Yes, it's hard to say much else. (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: How many notes were there simultaneously? It almost sounded like there was--certainly more than one note? Dr. HICHWA: Well, it's as our other guests have said. It's the combination of frequencies\u2026 FLATOW: Right. Dr. HICHWA: \u2026that create that. FLATOW: It's not a pure tone, certainly not a pure tone from what they were doing. And do other cultures do this? It almost sounded like the Australian Aborigine sort of music when I was listening to it. Dr. HICHWA: Very similar. FLATOW: Yes. Dr. Holmes? Dr. HOLMES: The Aborigines have an instrument called a didgeridoo, which works pretty much the same way. The player drones on a very low note. And by changing the shape of their oral cavity changes the quality of the sound and lets you hear other harmonics that otherwise you wouldn't have noticed. FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255 is our number. Yes, sir. Mr. ERIN SCHREND(ph) (Audience Member): Okay. So my name is Erin Schrend. I'm from Marine County, which is just north of here, I think. Maybe south, I don't know. (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. SCHREND: I was wondering, for instance, like a tom tom drum, if the sides were made out of metal or wood, would it affect the sound of the instrument? If it does, in what way? FLATOW: Yeah. The actual, you know, is it the skin that counts or is it the metal and the wood that also has something to do with it? David? Professor KIRKBY: It's the skin that counts. The wood does vibrate a little bit, but very, very little compared to how the skin vibrates. So it's often surprising you can make instruments out of quite different materials. Bryant suggested making a brass instrument out of a brass, out of a garden hose. It actually work surprisingly well. FLATOW: How long a hose should it be? Fifty feet? A hundred feet? Professor KIRKBY: Well, are you after a trombone or a trumpet? (Soundbite of laughter) Professor HICHWA: A hundred and forty-one centimeters, of course. FLATOW: Absolutely. Well that was about five feet long, something like that. Well, Brian, why is it that even though you construct instruments in the same way, they sound different? I'm talking not about a drum versus a violin, but I'm talking about, let's talk about a violin itself. Why do you think a Stradivarius is so much better? What is it about the wood or how it's made, one instrument compared to another? Professor HOLMES: Well we've obviously studied the Stradivarius and Amadi(ph) violins for many, many years. And it still remains somewhat of a mystery, but people have looked at the different materials that are used. And in Northern Italy for example, in the forest up there where the wood came from for these instruments, on one side of the valley there've been more rainfall than on the other side. So the tree rings would be spaced differently, which would give a different density to the wood. And so by using the different pieces of wood like that, and the different parts, they made a different sounding instrument. And the question is, well, can we do that today? Why can't we just look at what's there? And it's a very difficult question to answer. FLATOW: Yes, Bryant? Professor HICHWA: It's especially difficult for a scientist to answer because scientists love experiments with one variable. And so a scientist who studies the varnish on a violin for two years then imagines that the varnish is really important. What's interesting is, scientists will publish articles on the secret of the Stradivarius violin, there's a new article like that about every 18 months. And it's always a different secret, because the violin is a complex system with not just one variable. FLATOW: Varnish was big for a long time, wasn't it? Professor HICHWA: Uh huh. FLATOW: Then I heard this theory about the water and the tree rings. What would be the next one that we could -- what other thing goes into a violin that would affect how it sounds? Professor HICHWA: How you shape the wood is really important. What's fascinating about the Stradivarius violins is that they're no longer being played the way they were designed to play. The instruments are being played at a higher pitch, because concert pitch has risen. Players now use steel strings instead of gut strings in order to withstand the extra tension that these loud violins make. They've had to put in new sound posts between the top and back plate, and reinforce the bass bar. And so, of the many Stradivarius violins that survive now, only one is actually being played the way Stradivarius designed it. FLATOW: They've actually changed the violin by adding that? Professor HICHWA: Sure. Added material to it. They want it to be loud, and loud violins have steel strings these days. FLATOW: I didn't know that. And in fact the acoustics of the concert hall where instruments are played are very important to how things sound. Professor HICHWA: It matters a lot, because if you're in a very large space it's very resonant, and the sound takes a long time to die away. Think of what organ music is like in a church. It used to be concert halls were much smaller, the sound died away more rapidly, and you could have more rapid pace. This especially shows up in the music of Beethoven. Beethoven was very good about putting metronome markings, how fast the music went. But modern orchestras in more reverberant halls often play the music much more slowly so that the detail can come out. FLATOW: Let me see if I can get one more call in before we have to say goodbye. Martha in Cleveland. Hi, Martha. MARTHA (Caller): Hi. I'm a classical musician myself in the Cleveland Orchestra, a flutist. And just recently gone back and reviewed the Leonard Bernstein Norton Harvard Lectures, which was something that inspired me a great deal. I think they were done in the \u201860s and maybe I watched them in the \u201870s. But just in opposition to scientists being fascinated with music, I'm curious if your guests are familiar with these lectures, where Bernstein was very fascinated with linguistics and this case, and made a very persuasive analogy with Chomskian linguistics, talking first about phonology and then syntax and underlying structure and semantics, and so on. FLATOW: Brian, you have any comment? Any of my guests? Professor HOLMES: I think Bernstein has hit on something really important. I've always thought that music occupies the same region of our brain that language does, that we don't recognize individuals notes, but musicians tend to recognize patterns of notes, fragments of melodies when they look at a piece of music, in the same way that as we hear words, we don't hear the individual phonemes, but we gather them together into syntactical units. FLATOW: Is there something -- thanks for calling, Martha. MARTHA: Oh, thank you very much. FLATOW: You're welcome. Is there something about studying music that -- I always give a blank check question to my guests, about if they had a blank check and could spend it on something to study something, what would you, Bryant, what would you like to study? Something about music? What don't we know that you would need to find out, maybe about instruments or something? Professor HICHWA: I think a topic that's always interested me is, what difference does it make whether a brass instrument, such as the ones I play, have a small dent there, or there? FLATOW: A dent? Professor HICHWA: Yeah. They're not always perfect. But should I bother to repair my instrument if there's a small dent in the bell, or if there's a small dent in the lead pipe. What difference does it make? Or if I have an instrument that's out of tune, is there a way I can dent the instrument to make it play in tune? Anything to avoid practicing. (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: David, do you have anything that you'd like to study, or\u2026? Professor KIRKBY: Well, one thing that's fascinated me is, if you look at the strings in the orchestra, the violin, the viola, the violin always seems to be the one that gets the most attention. But to look at them, they look like they're the, you know, the double bass looks like it's just a big violin. So why, so there are some special qualities about the construction of the violin that make it really unique and stand out. I'd like to understand that better. FLATOW: Brian? Professor HOLMES: I'm interested in studying historical instruments. And a colleague of mine at the University of Northern Iowa, David Rachor, and I are studying baroque bassoons. And it's kind of interesting to see the difference between a historical instrument and a modern one. A modern one has keys, and you can place the holes in all the right places where you're supposed to; wherein the historic instruments, the holes are placed where your hand, the size of your hand is to block the air coming out of the holes. And so all of these things, you have all these bleak holes drilled into the baroque bassoons. FLATOW: We actually have a sound of one of them. Professor HOLMES: Right. FLATOW: You brought it along. Let's see if we can hear that sound of a baroque bassoon. (Soundbite of baroque bassoon) FLATOW: Wow. Professor HOLMES: Yeah. It's kind of an interesting sounding instrument. And like we were discussing earlier, with regard to the missing fundamental, that sound that wasn't there? In a number of the notes in the bassoon, the note that they play is not the note you hear. You perceive a much different note than the note they're actually playing. Professor KIRKBY: Right. FLATOW: Well, I think there's no better way than ending today then with some music. Some music, of course. We're talking about music this hour on TALK OF THE NATION Science Friday, from NPR News. And the piece that we're going to end on is Mozart's Rondo in D for a First Horn Concerto in a version for Horn and Piano. And it's going to be played by Dr. Brian Holmes on that valve-less horn he was playing before, with the accompaniment of Demetrie Cogen(ph) on piano. Gentlemen? (Soundbite of Mozart's Rondo in D) FLATOW: I'd like to thank my guests this hour, Brian Hichwa, Professor of Physics and Astronomy at Sonoma State University. David Kirkby, Associate Professor of Physics at the University of California Irvine. Brian Holmes, Professor of Physics at San Jose State University, playing the valve-less horn, accompanied by` Demetrie Cogen on piano.  IRA FLATOW, host:  From NPR News in San Francisco, this is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow.  Take a few select notes, add an envelope, some harmonics, and just the right timbre. Now let that vibrate your basilar membrane. What do you have? Beethoven's Ninth, of course. This hour, a look at the physics of music.  Why does a violin sound different from a clarinet? What makes a sound musical while another is just noise? From the shape of your ear canal to the wave properties of sound, physics can tell us a lot about music. We'll talk about it with the help of some ancient bassoons, Tuvan throat singers, and a lesson in building a brass instrument. It's all coming up after this break. Stay with us.  (Soundbite of News)  IRA FLATOW, host:  This is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow. This hour, we're alive coming to you from the Exploratorium in San Francisco. And what better place to explore the intersection of art and science than the Exploratorium, a terrific science museum and place to experiment here in San Francisco.  And this hour, we're gonna take a look at the disciplines that aren't usually talked about together, but are very much related. And I'm talking about physics and music. We can, what can one teach about the other? And we can know something about physics, what would you know about music? Can you explain music scientifically? Can knowing a little about the science of music enhance your appreciation of it? I certainly think so, and I'm hoping by the end of the hour, you will, too. And you'll see why because we're gonna have a lot of fun this hour.  We're lucky to be here in California, always on the cutting edge. Several universities in the state are offering courses that look at the physics of music. I'm going to be joined here by three physicists who teach or have taught such a class. Maybe you can start one in your own university or your high school after you hear about what they do in their physics classes.  Bryant Hichwa is a professor of physics and astronomy at Sonoma State University in Rohnert Park, California. Thanks for being with us today.  Dr. BRYANT HICHWA (Sonoma State University): Good to be here.  FLATOW: David Kirby, Kirkby is associate professor of physics at the University of California in Irvine. Welcome to Science Friday.  Dr. DAVID KIRKBY (University of California, Irvine): Thanks, Ira.  FLATOW: And Brian Holmes is professor of physics at San Jose State University. Thank you for being with us today, Brian.  Dr. BRIAN HOLMES (San Jose State University): Hi, Ira.  FLATOW: Hi, there. Let me begin with you by talking to Dr. Hichwa. Why teach this course? What do students get out of a course like this?  Dr. HICHWA: Well, besides being fun to teach a course like this, we find that a lot of students today have a real phobia about math and science. And in the technological world that we live in, it's really important that students not fear science and math. And so, we use this type of a course to really get to the students and, you know, use the mechanism of teaching music, the scientific aspect of music, to get to the physics.  FLATOW: So do they view this as music, a music teacher teaching physics or a music to learn physics, a physics to learn music?  Dr. HICHWA: Well, you always have to take it from the music perspective, because you gotta get the--you gotta get them interested in the class. And by the way, you sneak in a little bit of physics as you go along.  (Soundbite of laughter)  FLATOW: Are you the same way, Dr. Kirkby? Do you think the same thing about--the same view about teaching physics and music? Do you use the music as a means of teaching physics?  Dr. KIRKBY: Well, the class I teach is definitely a physics class.  FLATOW: Yeah.  Dr. KIRKBY: I get students from all over campus taking it. Not, particularly, a lot of musicians taking it.  FLATOW: Hmm. And why did you begin to teach this course? Something that you, in your background, told you this would be useful?  Dr. KIRKBY: Yeah, I had a really hard time deciding whether to do music or physics as a career, and. . .  FLATOW: Really?  Dr. KIRKBY: Of course everyone told me to do physics.  FLATOW: Music. Physics.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Dr. KIRKBY: Right. So this was an opportunity to actually bring music back into my career, to teach this course, so.  FLATOW: Mm hmm. And Brian Holmes, you certainly demonstrate a lot of music and physics.  Dr. HOLMES: Well, I'm, again, a person who failed to make an adequate choice between physics and music, and so I try to do both.  FLATOW: Mm hmm.  Dr. HOLMES: I think the expression you're looking for is master of none.  (Soundbite of laughter)  FLATOW: Well, it's good to be--it's, I would say, it's eclectic. You have a little bit of knowledge in all different kinds of areas. I'd rather look at it that way.  Dr. HOLMES: Yes, and I think it gives a, me a lot of credibility that I can function as a professional musician. Musicians are rightfully skeptical of what scientists tell them, unless you understand that both scientists and musicians have their own useful points of view. Often they use the same words and mean different things, and so it's helpful to cross that divide.  FLATOW: Well, that's a good place to start our little music education course here today on SCIENCE FRIDAY because let's talk about how science informs us about music. First, let's talk about what is the difference between noise and music, David Kirkby, What makes a sound musical, versus nonmusical?  Dr. KIRKBY: Well, I think you get a very different answer depending on who you ask. Well, let me answer that question as a physicist. So I think there's really three essential qualities for a musical sound: pitch, envelope and timbre.  FLATOW: Mm hmm.  Dr. KIRKBY: So I have some examples here, actually, so I can. . .  FLATOW: All right, let's go to example number one.  Dr. KIRKBY: So let me play you an example. So this is sounds which only have that first quality, pitch. And it's, you're gonna hear a recognizable melody, but it won't sound very musical.  (Soundbite of music with pitch)  Dr. KIRBY: OK, so you recognize the melody there, and so that's. . .  (Soundbite of music with pitch)  Dr. KIRBY:. . . very. So pitch is the quality that really makes a melody possible.  FLATOW: Mm hmm.  Dr. KIRKBY: It's what musicians, it's how musicians identify notes like C sharp or B flat.  FLATOW: So you have the notes, but you don't have music yet.  Dr. KIRKBY: Right, you don't have music yet. And what is pitch? Well, it's, when you're talking about sound, it's always difficult because it's an abstract thing, You can't see sounds. So I like to think of it--a musical note is like dropping a stone in a pond. And that creates a set of ripples that spread out in circles, and those ripples are a wave, and that's just like. . .  FLATOW: Right.  Dr. KIRKBY: . . . a wave of sound. The difference is that with music, they're ripples that's sloshing back and forth of air, instead of water. And pitch is just a measurement of how often those waves reach your eardrum.  FLATOW: So what do you have to add now?  Dr. KIRKBY: So, right, to make it more musical. . .  FLATOW: Yeah.  Dr. KIRKBY: . . . we need to add those other two ingredients: envelope and the timbre. So the envelope is really describing the height of those waves as they reach you. In the sample you just heard, it wasn't very musical: the waves all reached you with exactly the same height. So it started abruptly, it was a very monotonous sound, and it ended abruptly.  And one of the ways you recognize different instruments is that--a percussion instrument like a xylophone or a marimba, it ends--it begins very abruptly and then dies off very quickly. Whereas a saxophone, it takes a little bit of breathe to get the reed going. So let me play you an example. This is the same sample but now with the envelope of a, well, of a saxophone.  (Soundbite of music with pitch and a saxophone envelope)  Dr. KIRKBY: And compare that with a different envelope.  (Soundbite of music with pitch and a marimba envelope)  Dr. KIRKBY: So here, so there you--the only difference there was the shaping of the sound. We had the two ingredients: the pitch, which allows you to have different notes. . .  FLATOW: Right.  Dr. KIRKBY: And then we had the shaping of the envelope, and that's one of the ways that you tell the difference.  FLATOW: What was that other, what was that second?  Dr. KIRKBY: The second one was a marimba.  FLATOW: A marimba.  Dr. KIRKBY: Yeah.  FLATOW: So you put the marimba envelope on top of that.  Dr. KIRKBY: Right, right.  FLATOW: So now let's talk about the timbre.  Dr. KIRKBY: Right, the timbre is really the most complicated and the most difficult to talk about. It's really the quality of that's left over when we take out all of the elements that we know how to quantify. It's a bit like trying to describe a fine wine\u2026  FLATOW: Mm.  Dr. KIRKBY: \u2026the kind of words you have to use. But to a physicist, the timbre is a result of--when you hear a musical sound, you're not really hearing a simple vibration. It's not--the picture I gave you of a wave is not really accurate. The vibrations that reach your ear are very complicated, and they're actually a superposition of many vibrations. They're over--what musicians call overtones--and it's the way each instrument has a unique fingerprint, which is the recipe of those overtones that make up its sound.  So to illustrate that, I have a sample here, where we're gonna hear--we'll hear just to begin with a pure sound, the electronic equivalent to a tuning fork. And then we're gonna add additional tuning forks to create the sound of an instrument which you'll probably recognize as an organ.  (Soundbite of music)  FLATOW: Wow. Do you mean you took all those, you took those pure sounds together and add them up, and you get\u2026  Dr. KIRBY: Exactly  FLATOW: A totally different sounding\u2026  Dr. KIRKBY: Right. So it's amazing. And that's really what gives--what gives each instrument it's unique color. That recipe or finger print, that recipe of overtones that make it up. And the amazing thing is that when you hear all those tuning forks played together, if they have the right relationships between their frequencies, your brain actually assimilates it into one note. You're not aware of hearing 20 different tuning forks playing at once. You just, you just have a perception of an organ.  FLATOW: Um hmm. And Bryant Hichwa, is that in all cultures, work the same way? I mean, we tend to think of music as cultural entity. Is it possible to define music scientifically, using physics? Have we broken this down too much, and say, Well, you're not enjoying the music any more, you know. We've shown you these little pitches--can't we just enjoy it for what it is?  Prof. HICHWA: Well, if we go back and look, historically, scales developed over the course of many years. And as we moved into the modern era, we found that as we played different musical instruments together, they didn't sound very good. And from a scientific prospective, we took our scale and we divided it up into twelve equal parts. So, from a scientific perspective, yes we can--we can look at all the notes, we can quantify them in terms of their frequencies, or pitch--but again, you know, it's that perception that's important. So yes, we can look at it from a scientific perspective, but it's the musical perspective, I think, that wins out.  FLATOW: Brian, any comments on it?  Dr. HOLMES: One thing that's always interested me is that Galileo's father, Vincenzo Galilei, was a composer and a significant lute player. And he was very concerned about the mathematics of harmony. He may have been the first European to propose equal temperament. And it was in his experiments with the vibrations of the string, that may have taught Galileo, himself, some of the virtues of the experimental method. So I think there's a very direct tie between music and science, there.  FLATOW: Un huh. You think that this was always at the back of their minds, some sort of explanation.  Dr. HOLMES: Yes, I think that you find that people who deal with music theory often have a very strong technical bent. They're interested in math, they have, they work on very fine details.  FLATOW: Um hum. David, do you agree?  Dr. KIRKBY: Yeah, there's a surprising number of--not just physicists, but all types of scientist--who really, who have strong connections in music and strong backgrounds.  FLATOW: Um hum. Does your brain actually manipulate sound?  Dr. KIRKBY: It definitely does. But the--I was just telling you how the overtones build the fingerprint of each instrument. And you're not aware of all those overtones individually. The signals are going into your brain, but your brain, helpfully, reduces all of that information into just a perception of a single note.  FLATOW: We're going to come back and talk lots more about music, and have a great demonstration from Brian about how to build a brass instrument. I'd like you to encourage you here in the audience at the Exploratorium to step up to the mike, and maybe you have some musical questions about music and science you'd like to ask, and our number here, on the phone, as always is 1-800-989-8255. So get ready to have a musical interlude when we come back. Stay with us.  (Soundbite of music)  FLATOW: You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION: Science Friday. I'm Ira Flatow. We're talking this hour about the physics of music with my guests Bryant Hichwa, professor of physics and astronomy at Sonoma State University, David Kirkby, associate professor of physics at University of California Irvine, Bryan Holmes, professor of physics at San Jose State University, and Dr. Holmes is on his way to help us build a brass instrument. But just to warm us up before we get right to that, I want to just go over a little bit of a subject I was talking with Dr. Kirkby before about our brain manipulating sound. Give us an example. I know you have an example of virtual pitch that you can play for us.  Dr. KIRKBY: Ok, yes. The question there--a way of framing the question is why is it you can hear the lowest note on the piano? Because the frequency of the lowest note, if you look it up, is actually something below what most people can hear. And the reason is, it's all of those overtones. When you strike that lowest note on the piano, you're really exciting many other overtones, and so your brain is--even though you're not actually able to hear the fundamental, really the foundation of the sound--your brain extrapolates and fills it in. So I'm going to play you an example. And so this is the same Bach Invention, where I've removed the foundation of the sounds. So it's a bit like watching someone walk down the stairs. When they're at the top of the stairs you see them. You know they're standing on their feet. As they walk down you can't see their feet any more. But your brain fills in the blanks, and seems they're still there. And so it's the analogy of that. So here we go.  (Soundbite of music)  Dr. KIRKBY: Sorry.  FLATOW: Modern Technology again, bites us.  (Soundbite of music)  Dr. KIRKBY: Okay, I'm going to give up on that one.  FLATOW: We'll come back to that. That's nature's way of telling us that Brian Holmes is ready to come and talk to us about a demonstration. Quite interesting one. What I want you to listen to this very carefully. It's on how to build a brass instrument. Dr. Holmes, I presume.  Dr. HOLMES: Yes.  First off, I need to clarify an issue. When you play a brass instrument, in the English language we say you blow a trumpet, but blowing is really inadequate. I'm going to blow a trumpet, but you'll hear  (Sound of blowing in trumpet)  Dr. HOLMES: It doesn't produce a result. You have to put some sound into it, and so I'm going to, you have to buzz your lips  (Sound of buzzing lips)  Dr. HOLMES: to get the result. And I'll do that into the trumpet, and then I'll take the trumpet away from my mouth and you'll hear me buzz.  (Sound of trumpet & lips buzzing)  FLATOW: Oh, so you have to do that buzzing?  Dr. HOLMES: You got to do that. So every time you hear a trumpet player, you admire, their going (sound of lips buzzing) right at you.  (Soundbite of laughter)  FLATOW: So, but that's a real trumpet. You have in your hand some interesting looking plumbing. If I might describe it.  Dr. HOLMES: Yes. You might describe it that way. I have a tube which is made out of trumpet playing tube It's trumpet make--trumpet tube. It's about a quarter of an inch in diameter. Same diameter as a trumpet. And it's 141 centimeters long, so this is a tube just as long as a trumpet, but it doesn't have a flared bell on the end.  FLATOW: It looks like about a half inch in diameter. Would I say? That's about right?  Dr. HOLMES: Yeah.  FLATOW: It's a tube a half inch in diameter.  Dr. HOLMES: Sure. So I'm going to buzz my lips into this, and you'll hear that it likes certain notes. So here goes.  (Sound of trumpet)  Dr. HOLMES: Now does that sound like a trumpet to you?  FLATOW: Something you hear at the ball game, I think. It sounds more like\u2026  Dr. HOLMES: Well, yes, but how does it sound different from a trumpet?  FLATOW: Well, it doesn't have a ring to it.  Dr. HOLMES: Yeah, and it's also not very loud.  FLATOW: Right  Dr. HOLMES: It's also out of tune.  FLATOW: All those things.  Dr. HOLMES: But that's true of most trumpets, so\u2026 If you could hear me try to do a bugle call.  FLATOW: Let me let you stand back so you get a better shot at the microphone so you can hear it.  Dr. HOLMES: Okay.  (Sound of tube being played)  FLATOW: The horses almost came to the gate on that one.  Dr. HOLMES: No, I think they're still where they can get some nice food.  So, in order to turn this into a trumpet, the first thing I would, got to try to do is to put a bell on it. This is a flared tapered bell. It's the big end of the trumpet. And I can do this by replacing a cylindrical piece of tubing with the bell.  And so, when I put this on, the bell acts a little bit as a megaphone. It means that more energy gets into the room. And so when I sound it like this, I want you to hear how it sounds.  (Sound of tube with bell being played)  FLATOW: We're getting closer.  Dr. HOLMES: It's a little closer. It's louder, and it's also getting more high frequency energy into the room. What you might not have noticed is that the pitch is also changed. This thing is actually more in tune than it was before. But it's still not a trumpet.  Do you know what you find at the front end of the trumpet?  FLATOW: The mouthpiece.  Dr. HOLMES: No, you find a trumpet player.  FLATOW: (Unintelligible) boom-bing.  Dr. HOLMES: Sorry. That's a little musicians' joke there.  At the front end of the trumpet you have a mouthpiece, which has a hemispherical cup that's maybe a half an inch across and half an inch deep.  FLATOW: Right  Dr. HOLMES: When I buzz my lips like this (buzz of lips), and then when I do it into the mouthpiece (buzz through mouthpiece), it sounds a lot buzzier, it sounds a lot edgier. And the reason is that this cup acts like a coke bottle. When you blow across the top of a coke bottle, you hear a certain sound. Well, the mouthpiece of a trumpet really loves sounds near 800 cycles per second. And those are amplified. That's the difference between this sound (buzz of lips) and this sound (buzz through mouthpiece). And so when I put this on the front end of the trumpet, you expect it to have this edgier sound. But there's another--So I'm now assembling it.  It's still 141 centimeters long, but now it has a mouthpiece on the front end, and it has a bell.  (Sound of trumpet)  FLATOW: Very nice. And it looks like, now, one of those trumpets that we're use to seeing.  Dr. HOLMES: Yes. But this tells you why you have to have a bell on a trumpet. Why you have to have a mouthpiece. And why they never design trumpets with holes in the sides. Woodwinds, like clarinets and flutes, have holes in the sides to get different notes. But if you put a hole in the side of a trumpet, that doesn't work out at all, and I have carefully engineered a trumpet here. So I can demonstrate that.  FLATOW: And while you're getting that ready, that trumpet that you have has no valves on it, either. You were making all those notes just with your lips, right?  Dr. HOLMES: Yeah. I buzzed my lips (buzz through lips), and the instrument chooses the notes that is likes.  (arpeggio on trumpet)  FLATOW: We're tuning up here.  Dr. HOLMES: Right. So this is what a trumpet would sound like if there were holes in the side. And I've done this with a real trumpet and I've removed the second valve tuning slide.  Here's the instrument with the sound coming out the bell. ( playing trumpet)  Now coming out the hole in the side (Playing trumpet with hole)  If you wanted to base your trumpet on holes in the side, this might be the way it would sound. (playing trumpet with hole)  FLATOW: Not very satisfying trumpets  Dr. HOLMES: Not very satisfying. And so, the purpose of valves on a trumpet is to extend the length of the instrument. And that causes the sounds to be lower in pitch, but the sounds are still being processed by the bell. And so they have the trumpet-like character.  FLATOW: Who decided to put valves on a trumpet? If you were playing it so well without, you know, just with your mouth making the sounds, why have the valves? Who discovered or say, hey, this is a good idea?  Dr. HOLMES: Well, I was playing well, Ira, and I thank you for that. But the problem is, I couldn't play very much. And as a trumpet player, I object to that. Listen, there are only five or six notes.  (playing trumpet)  Dr. HOLMES: And so the only jobs you're qualified for are jobs at racetracks.  But if you can have valves, then you can get all the notes in between the notes that were the open notes.  FLATOW: So the valves don't open holes up in the trumpet. You said they extend or they\u2026  Dr. HOLMES: They extend the length of the tubing. For example I'm going to play a pattern of notes. And then I'm going to play with the first valve down. The first valve extends the length of the instrument by 12 percent. And that will lower all the pitches by 12 percent. So here's without the valves, and then with the first valve.  (playing trumpet)  Dr. HOLMES: It's the same pattern, but all the frequencies have been lowered by a set amount. And because there are three valves, then I can get all the notes in between the open notes of the instrument.  FLATOW: You know that old song, you know, I push this button down here and the music goes round and round, you know the rest of the song, and comes out here.  Dr. HOLMES: Well, the music does go round and round. And you might think that the sound comes out the bell, but what's really interesting is, when the sound reaches the bell, most of it reflects and stays inside the instrument. Only two percent of the energy leaks out.  FLATOW: Two percent.  Dr. HOLMES: Only two percent. You may think that my trumpet playing is really loud. But be really grateful that you're not some tiny insect living inside the instrument\u2026  FLATOW: Wow.  Dr. HOLMES: \u2026where the sound is much louder. But in fact, the fact that so little of the sound goes into the room is why a trumpet is playable because the sound goes to the bell and it reflects back to my lips.  My lips are always being bombarded by high and low pressure puffs of air, and this controls the frequency of my lips. And this control enables the oscillating standing wave inside the instrument to draw more energy from my lips.  FLATOW: So only two percent of it, wow. Is that an efficient instrument? Are most instruments, or other brass instruments, the same way--work in the same way?  Dr. HOLMES: Most brass instruments are that way. Typically, as they go to higher frequencies, they are more efficient projectors of sound. And so you could say that the bell is a high-pass filter, or to be less technical, a bell is like turning on the treble knob on your stereo; it causes more high frequency stuff to come out of the instrument.  FLATOW: Why do some instruments then have the holes in them and others don't have the holes in the them?  Dr. HOLMES: Well, flutes and clarinets are instruments which are cylindrical in their profile. So if you open a hole in the side of the cylinder, it's still a cylinder in shape.  The trumpet has a cylindrical section but then a flared end. If you open a hole in the side, you're going to get rid of the flared end and you're going to change its shape.  But the woodwinds work because, by opening holes in the side, you don't change the shapes of them.  FLATOW: Is this the ultimate shape a trumpet should be or could be? Could you make a trumpet better or work differently?  Dr. HOLMES: Well, trumpet players will give you lots of arguments on that score. And indeed, for certain kinds of music and for certain kinds of use, players will choose different instruments. They have vivid opinions.  And what to us, as physicists, would seem to be remarkably miniscule and insignificant details are lifeblood for a professional musician.  FLATOW: So what's your take on building, you know, a trumpet from scratch? Can anybody do this thing? Can you change other parts now, if you wanted to make it sound differently?  Dr. HOLMES: Yes, you can replace the bell with a bell of a different flare. But if you want to do this at home, get yourself a length of garden hose, take a trumpet mouthpiece, wrap it with electrical tape, put it one end and put a funnel in the other end. You'll get a pretty good working brass instrument and not have to spend a lot of money.  (Soundbite of laughter)  FLATOW: Well, thank you very much for this demonstration. It was just terrific.  Let's go back to Dr. Kirkby and see if he's got his sound, the note that the brain is going to put there that's not really there. You've got that\u2026  Dr. KIRKBY: Let's give that a try.  FLATOW: Explain again what you are going to be demonstrating.  Dr. KIRKBY: Well, it's the audio analogy of someone walking down the stairs. And when you hear a note, what your brain tells you about it is the only foundation; basically their feet is what your perception is of.  But as they walk down the stairs, you still know their feet are there even though you can't see it. So this is the equivalent, I hope.  (Soundbite of music)  Dr. KIRKBY: Nope.  (Soundbite of laughter)  FLATOW: I love live radio. We'll give you one more shot and then we'll go to the phones. 1-800-989-8255 is our number. Go ahead. Do you want to try it again?  Dr. KIRKBY: All right.  FLATOW: Go ahead.  (Soundbite of music)  Dr. KIRKBY: Okay, so why don't I actually explain what you are hearing instead.  FLATOW: Okay.  Dr. KIRKBY: So this is an auditory illusion. Illusions are a great way to learn about how the brain works--optical illusions. And people don't often realize that there's also auditory illusions.  And so this is not a real instrument. It's not an instrument that you could ever build because it has overtones that your brain's not used to hearing. So your brain doesn't do a good job of figuring out what the pitch is.  And so this is a scale. Brian was talking about scales. And it's the same scale repeating over and over. But your perception is of a scale that keeps on rising forever and ever.  So it's a bit like that Escher lithograph\u2026  FLATOW: Right. Right.  Dr. KIRKBY: \u2026of the ascending, descending. So let's hear that.  (Soundbite of music)  FLATOW: That's not descending and rising? It's\u2026  Dr. KIRKBY: No, it's just keeps on going. It's the same scale repeating over and over\u2026  FLATOW: Wow.  Dr. KIRKBY: \u2026just playing the same 12 notes. But you have a perception--because we're really playing with your brain. Your brain is used to hearing certain patterns of overtones that occur in nature, the ones that you get in pipes, for example.  FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255 is our number. We're talking about the physics of music this hour on TALK OF THE NATION: Science Friday. I'm Ira Flatow here at the Exploratorium in San Francisco.  Let's go to the phones and see what some of our listeners have got to say. Scott(ph) in Kalamazoo, very musical sounding city, is it not?  SCOTT (Caller): Indeed it is. Good afternoon. This is a topic that's near and dear to my heart. I'm a piano technician. And so I deal with all sorts of physics-related things every day in my work.  There are some real interesting physics involved with the sound of the piano and different pianos having to do with the length and thickness of the strings in various pianos and how that affects the sound of the piano and how the piano's tuned, because every piano is different.  This is called the scaling of the piano is the scheme that they use to determine, for a given piano, the size of the strings. And because that's different in every piano, every piano is tuned differently.  And that's, in a nutshell, why it takes a professional to be able to do a good job at tuning a piano because it involves a lot of training and listening to the overtones that you've been talking about and getting those to match up so that they sound good in that particular instrument.  FLATOW: So you just can't stick a little meter on the piano. You need a real human ear to listen to it.  SCOTT: Well, to a degree, yes. They, in the last, oh, I don't know, 10 or 15 years, they have actually invented a very advanced electronic--several different electronic tuning devices that are specific to pianos that basically they've developed to the point where they can electronically listen to these overtones in a similar way to how human ear listens to them and get the piano sounding pretty good.  But even with using those very advanced instruments, it still takes a human ear that knows what to listen for in order to confirm that the machine is really telling you where to put the string.  FLATOW: David Kirkby, agree?  Dr.  KIRKBY: Oh, yes, I definitely agree. I mean, you raise an interesting point about the material that's used for the strings, because, if you think about this, the piano covers many octaves. So if the strings were all identical, the notes--the strings that you hit when you play a low note would have to be several hundred times longer than the ones you play for the short notes.  So it wouldn't fit in the living room anymore. And so, in fact, if you look inside a piano, you'll see that the low notes, the strings are much thicker and they even have a material wound around them.  FLATOW: Yeah, I've--having grown up with a piano, I have wondered that quite often about why they sound so different.  We're going to talk lots more about the physics of music and sound and take more of your questions right here at the Exploratorium in San Francisco.  I'm Ira Flatow. Stay with us. We'll be right back after this short break.  (Soundbite of TALK OF THE NATION theme)  You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION: Science Friday. I'm Ira Flatow. We're talking this hour about the physics of music, coming to you from San Francisco in the Exploratorium with my guests, Bryant Hichwa, professor of physics and astronomy at Sonoma State University; David Kirkby, associate professor of physics at the University of California Irvine; Brian Holmes, professor of physics at San Jose State University.  Our number, 1-800-989-8255. Let's go to the floor here.  Yes, sir.  GEORGE(ph) (Audience Member): Hi. My name is George Krenin(ph) from Belmont, about 25 miles down the peninsula from here. Earlier, Dr. Holmes, when he was talking about why some wind instruments have holes in the side and some don't, he said that a distinguishing feature was the presence of a bell.  But saxophones have bells and they have holes in the side; clarinets have bells and holes in the side. And I was wondering if Dr. Holmes could expand on that or explain.  Dr. HOLMES: One short answer to your question was I lied.  (Soundbite of laughter)  FLATOW: There you have it. First person to ever admit they lied on Science Friday in public.  Dr. HOLMES: The second answer\u2026  FLATOW: Many have but never admit it. But go ahead.  Dr. HOLMES: Yes. The second answer is that a saxophone is pretty much all bell. The flare that you notice in a saxophone is primarily right at the very end. And so the bell is not nearly as long as it is for a trumpet.  A clarinet also has a bell. And the reason is a rather complex one, but when you have--when you're playing a clarinet and you have a bunch of holes open, the sound is coming not just out of the first open hole but out of the group of open holes, and that causes a lot of high frequency energy to be admitted by the row of holes.  If you have all the holes closed, as you do for the lowest note, then you're not going to get that projection of high frequency sound unless you put a bell on it which simulates the effect of having a row of holes.  You could have a perfectly cylindrical clarinet without a bell if you put two or three extra holes at the end that you never used.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Let's talk--let's listen to some more musical samples. Dr. Hichwa, we have some musical samples to listen to. Let's talk about what you have.  Dr. HICHWA: Okay, the first one is the Tuvan throat singer.  FLATOW: What is the -- tell us what Tuvan throat singers, what that is, what we're listening to.  Dr. HICHWA: In Middle Asia there's a culture there that people sing these very, very low notes. And in all of these cultures, the way that they do this is that--they play a lute-like instrument and it makes a low frequency.  And then they listen to that and it's a biofeedback process. They begin singing and matching the pitch that they're hearing. And what they have to do is that they have to change the cavities in their throat and their mouth.  And normally, you know, we have a pharynx, the throat cavity in our mouth, which projects the different frequencies that you hear. What they have to do is that they have to open up that opening between the throat and the mouth to make one continuous cavity. And so that's what they're doing. It's a very\u2026  FLATOW: That's a talent, a real talent.  Dr. HICHWA: \u2026real very, very difficult to do.  FLATOW: All right. We're going to hear some Tuvan throat singing with--it's called Step Cargera(ph), I think, is the name. Right? Correct? Correct me if I'm wrong. And the artist is Fedore Kao(ph). And let's hear that clip now.  (Soundbite of Step Cargera)  FLATOW: Wow.  Dr. HICHWA: Yes, it's hard to say much else.  (Soundbite of laughter)  FLATOW: How many notes were there simultaneously? It almost sounded like there was--certainly more than one note?  Dr. HICHWA: Well, it's as our other guests have said. It's the combination of frequencies\u2026  FLATOW: Right.  Dr. HICHWA: \u2026that create that.  FLATOW: It's not a pure tone, certainly not a pure tone from what they were doing. And do other cultures do this? It almost sounded like the Australian Aborigine sort of music when I was listening to it.  Dr. HICHWA: Very similar.  FLATOW: Yes. Dr. Holmes?  Dr. HOLMES: The Aborigines have an instrument called a didgeridoo, which works pretty much the same way. The player drones on a very low note. And by changing the shape of their oral cavity changes the quality of the sound and lets you hear other harmonics that otherwise you wouldn't have noticed.  FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255 is our number. Yes, sir.  Mr. ERIN SCHREND(ph) (Audience Member): Okay. So my name is Erin Schrend. I'm from Marine County, which is just north of here, I think. Maybe south, I don't know.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Mr. SCHREND: I was wondering, for instance, like a tom tom drum, if the sides were made out of metal or wood, would it affect the sound of the instrument? If it does, in what way?  FLATOW: Yeah. The actual, you know, is it the skin that counts or is it the metal and the wood that also has something to do with it? David?  Professor KIRKBY: It's the skin that counts. The wood does vibrate a little bit, but very, very little compared to how the skin vibrates. So it's often surprising you can make instruments out of quite different materials. Bryant suggested making a brass instrument out of a brass, out of a garden hose. It actually work surprisingly well.  FLATOW: How long a hose should it be? Fifty feet? A hundred feet?  Professor KIRKBY: Well, are you after a trombone or a trumpet?  (Soundbite of laughter)  Professor HICHWA: A hundred and forty-one centimeters, of course.  FLATOW: Absolutely. Well that was about five feet long, something like that. Well, Brian, why is it that even though you construct instruments in the same way, they sound different? I'm talking not about a drum versus a violin, but I'm talking about, let's talk about a violin itself. Why do you think a Stradivarius is so much better? What is it about the wood or how it's made, one instrument compared to another?  Professor HOLMES: Well we've obviously studied the Stradivarius and Amadi(ph) violins for many, many years. And it still remains somewhat of a mystery, but people have looked at the different materials that are used. And in Northern Italy for example, in the forest up there where the wood came from for these instruments, on one side of the valley there've been more rainfall than on the other side. So the tree rings would be spaced differently, which would give a different density to the wood.  And so by using the different pieces of wood like that, and the different parts, they made a different sounding instrument. And the question is, well, can we do that today? Why can't we just look at what's there? And it's a very difficult question to answer.  FLATOW: Yes, Bryant?  Professor HICHWA: It's especially difficult for a scientist to answer because scientists love experiments with one variable. And so a scientist who studies the varnish on a violin for two years then imagines that the varnish is really important.  What's interesting is, scientists will publish articles on the secret of the Stradivarius violin, there's a new article like that about every 18 months. And it's always a different secret, because the violin is a complex system with not just one variable.  FLATOW: Varnish was big for a long time, wasn't it?  Professor HICHWA: Uh huh.  FLATOW: Then I heard this theory about the water and the tree rings. What would be the next one that we could -- what other thing goes into a violin that would affect how it sounds?  Professor HICHWA: How you shape the wood is really important. What's fascinating about the Stradivarius violins is that they're no longer being played the way they were designed to play. The instruments are being played at a higher pitch, because concert pitch has risen. Players now use steel strings instead of gut strings in order to withstand the extra tension that these loud violins make. They've had to put in new sound posts between the top and back plate, and reinforce the bass bar. And so, of the many Stradivarius violins that survive now, only one is actually being played the way Stradivarius designed it.  FLATOW: They've actually changed the violin by adding that?  Professor HICHWA: Sure. Added material to it. They want it to be loud, and loud violins have steel strings these days.  FLATOW: I didn't know that. And in fact the acoustics of the concert hall where instruments are played are very important to how things sound.  Professor HICHWA: It matters a lot, because if you're in a very large space it's very resonant, and the sound takes a long time to die away. Think of what organ music is like in a church. It used to be concert halls were much smaller, the sound died away more rapidly, and you could have more rapid pace.  This especially shows up in the music of Beethoven. Beethoven was very good about putting metronome markings, how fast the music went. But modern orchestras in more reverberant halls often play the music much more slowly so that the detail can come out.  FLATOW: Let me see if I can get one more call in before we have to say goodbye. Martha in Cleveland. Hi, Martha.  MARTHA (Caller): Hi. I'm a classical musician myself in the Cleveland Orchestra, a flutist. And just recently gone back and reviewed the Leonard Bernstein Norton Harvard Lectures, which was something that inspired me a great deal. I think they were done in the \u201860s and maybe I watched them in the \u201870s. But just in opposition to scientists being fascinated with music, I'm curious if your guests are familiar with these lectures, where Bernstein was very fascinated with linguistics and this case, and made a very persuasive analogy with Chomskian linguistics, talking first about phonology and then syntax and underlying structure and semantics, and so on.  FLATOW: Brian, you have any comment? Any of my guests?  Professor HOLMES: I think Bernstein has hit on something really important. I've always thought that music occupies the same region of our brain that language does, that we don't recognize individuals notes, but musicians tend to recognize patterns of notes, fragments of melodies when they look at a piece of music, in the same way that as we hear words, we don't hear the individual phonemes, but we gather them together into syntactical units.  FLATOW: Is there something -- thanks for calling, Martha.  MARTHA: Oh, thank you very much.  FLATOW: You're welcome. Is there something about studying music that -- I always give a blank check question to my guests, about if they had a blank check and could spend it on something to study something, what would you, Bryant, what would you like to study? Something about music? What don't we know that you would need to find out, maybe about instruments or something?  Professor HICHWA: I think a topic that's always interested me is, what difference does it make whether a brass instrument, such as the ones I play, have a small dent there, or there?  FLATOW: A dent?  Professor HICHWA: Yeah. They're not always perfect. But should I bother to repair my instrument if there's a small dent in the bell, or if there's a small dent in the lead pipe. What difference does it make? Or if I have an instrument that's out of tune, is there a way I can dent the instrument to make it play in tune? Anything to avoid practicing.  (Soundbite of laughter)  FLATOW: David, do you have anything that you'd like to study, or\u2026?  Professor KIRKBY: Well, one thing that's fascinated me is, if you look at the strings in the orchestra, the violin, the viola, the violin always seems to be the one that gets the most attention. But to look at them, they look like they're the, you know, the double bass looks like it's just a big violin. So why, so there are some special qualities about the construction of the violin that make it really unique and stand out. I'd like to understand that better.  FLATOW: Brian?  Professor HOLMES: I'm interested in studying historical instruments. And a colleague of mine at the University of Northern Iowa, David Rachor, and I are studying baroque bassoons. And it's kind of interesting to see the difference between a historical instrument and a modern one. A modern one has keys, and you can place the holes in all the right places where you're supposed to; wherein the historic instruments, the holes are placed where your hand, the size of your hand is to block the air coming out of the holes. And so all of these things, you have all these bleak holes drilled into the baroque bassoons.  FLATOW: We actually have a sound of one of them.  Professor HOLMES: Right.  FLATOW: You brought it along. Let's see if we can hear that sound of a baroque bassoon.  (Soundbite of baroque bassoon)  FLATOW: Wow.  Professor HOLMES: Yeah. It's kind of an interesting sounding instrument. And like we were discussing earlier, with regard to the missing fundamental, that sound that wasn't there? In a number of the notes in the bassoon, the note that they play is not the note you hear. You perceive a much different note than the note they're actually playing.  Professor KIRKBY: Right.  FLATOW: Well, I think there's no better way than ending today then with some music. Some music, of course. We're talking about music this hour on TALK OF THE NATION Science Friday, from NPR News.  And the piece that we're going to end on is Mozart's Rondo in D for a First Horn Concerto in a version for Horn and Piano. And it's going to be played by Dr. Brian Holmes on that valve-less horn he was playing before, with the accompaniment of Demetrie Cogen(ph) on piano.  Gentlemen?  (Soundbite of Mozart's Rondo in D)  FLATOW: I'd like to thank my guests this hour, Brian Hichwa, Professor of Physics and Astronomy at Sonoma State University. David Kirkby, Associate Professor of Physics at the University of California Irvine. Brian Holmes, Professor of Physics at San Jose State University, playing the valve-less horn, accompanied by` Demetrie Cogen on piano.

Last month several researchers announced what they say is proof positive that we humans are still evolving. They scanned the human genome and found 700 genes that have appear to have responded to the pressure of natural selection within the last 10,000 years. Now that doesn't sound like, sounds like a long time, but, you know, it's a flip on the radar screen in terms of evolutionary history. And there's some of the more interesting genes. Genes that allow us to digest lactose as adults, genes that influence skin color, bone structure. Now this news may surprise you, if you're one of many of us accustomed to thinking about evolution as a thing of the past or something that happens to other animals, not to us. But I'll bet my next guest was not-at-all surprised by this study. He's written a book that makes the case that genetics is the backbone underlying every major evolutionary advance in our history and prehistory. That our genes hold a story that our evolution from apes to humans, our migration out of Africa and around the globe, our transition from hunter-gatherers to more complex societies, and our development of language and complex behaviors. This hour we're going to be talking about how DNA is re-writing our history, how evolution is still happening today, about the future evolution of human species. Could our human population one day become distinct species. A lot to talk about, if you'd like to join in. Our number is 1-800-989-8255. Nicholas Wade is the author of BEFORE THE DAWN: RECOVERING THE LOST HISTORY OF OUR ANCESTORS, out this month from Penguin Press. Science reporter from The New York Times, here in New York, been a science reporter for decades, as long as I've been doing this, if not longer. He joins me here in our NPR studios. Welcome back to the program, Nick. Mr. NICHOLAS WADE (Author, \"Before The Dawn\"): Thanks Ira. FLATOW: What made you want to write this book, BEFORE THE DAWN? That's a typical question you ask of an author, but I know you do specialize in this field. Mr. WADE: Well I, I found I was writing many stories about genetics, growing a human genome that was sequenced just three years ago, 2003, and many of them looks into dark corners of the human past that we, had been inaccessible before then. And I conceived the idea of writing this book focused on the most recent 50,000 years of our history. There are many books about fossil skulls and stone tools, and those end about 100,000 years ago. But 50,000 years ago I think is where it really starts to get interesting. That's when the ancestral human population lived. And many of these new genetic findings help explain aspects of our past that we would never have known about, otherwise. So in the book I've tried to weave together all the traditional disagreements that bear on the human past, archeology, paleo-anthropology, historical linguistics, with the thread of genetics as the common theme. FLATOW: Do we actually carry with us all that history, going back 50/100 thousand years? Mr. WADE: Well, we do, it's all in our genealogy and it's very ancient. It's changing all the time, but it has an ancient pedigree. FLATOW: Uh huh. And how does that show up. How is it carried? You talk very interestingly about the y chromosome and the mitochondrial DNA, and how that's passed down. I thought that was fascinating. Explain that to us. Mr. WADE: Well, the Y chromosome is a wonderful way of tracking our migrations across the globe from our ancestral homeland somewhere in northeast Africa, probably around Ethiopia. And the reason that is, is two-fold. First is, very surprisingly, everyone, every man carries the same y chromosome inherited from some genetic Adam who lived in the ancestral human population. Of course there are about 2,000 men in that early population but only one Y chromosome survived. And it's weird because in each generation, some men will have either daughters or no children. So their Y chromosomes will get extinct. And in the small population, one gene or chromosome, whatever, will substitute for the others. But the second reason is that although it's the same chromosome that all us men carry, mutations have built up on it generation by generation. And you can use these mutations to sort of create a tree and assign each man to a branch. And these branches still bear the geographical pattern of how we spread across the globe. FLATOW: And as far as the female side? Mr. WADE: Right. I should have mentioned, the Y chromosome is not shuffled between generations like all the rest of the genes. So that makes it very easy to track. And there's one other part of the genome that doesn't get shuffled and that is the mitochondrial DNA which comes just through the mother because the sperm's mitochondria are destroyed when it fertilizes the egg. So only the mothers prevail. FLATOW: One of the surprising things about the history of this, the following the DNAs, how the DNA evidence fits with the timeline of human evolution. It comes from the fossil evidence. How good a fit is it? And how do we know it's such a good fit? Mr. WADE: Well, I think, I mean, it's what I regard as a forced fit because the genetic dates are very interesting. And they got it in a relative sense. They tell you A comes before B. But you should distrust the numbers that the geneticist put out when they say, well, mitochondrial E lived 128,000 years ago. Yes, but it's give or take 50,000 years either way. So for really good dates, you know, it needs to go to the archaeology. And the carbon 14 dates are solid. You can go to the bank with them. So I think one takes the relative -- if you've got a genetic tree of whatever, the Y chromosome and going across the world, their are branch points on it, each of which can be taken in a relative sense. But for an absolute date, you just need to fix one branch with an archaeological date and that allows you to read off all the others in the relative terms. FLATOW: Does the DNA fit more gaps than the fossil record does? Mr. WADE: Well, it does in a sense in that the fossil record is inherently gappy but the genetic record is sort of complete and continuous. So you can get a fix on any gene you want simply by sampling enough genes in today's population and working backwards from those to whatever period you're interested in. FLATOW: One of the biggest puzzles that we always talk about in evolution is at what joint, what point the ancestors of humans and chimps, where were they joint that they came from? Can DNA evidence provide any answers to that? Mr. WADE: Well, it can because we have no fossils in that critical period when we and the chimps started to split apart\u2026 FLATOW: Right. Mr. WADE: \u2026from our common ancestors. But you can draw up a genetic, a tree, if you look at the DNA of us and all the great apes. And that gives you a tree. And the part of it you can date very well is when the orangutans branched off from the African apes. And with that date, which I think is like 12 million years ago, you can say, well, chimps and humans must have parted company about five million years ago. FLATOW: Talking with Nicholas Wade, author of Before the Dawn: Recovering the Lost History of Our Ancestors, on TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. I'm Ira Flatow. If we all have the, all we men, have the same Y chromosome from that one person 50,000 years ago, why do we all look so different and act so different, you know? What happened there? Mr. WADE: Well, I think the answer there, you get into the previously murky subject of the genetic basis of race. So there's been what I would call a conspiracy of silence on this. The geneticists have not really wanted to say much about it, for good reason. They really didn't know very much until recently. The social scientists have much preferred to say, well, race is a social construct. It's not biological. There's nothing genetic there. And we're all, all diversity is cultural. So everyone's been sort of happy with that position. And there are good sort of historical reasons why we've taken that course. But now that the geneticists are beginning to understand the genetic differentiation of the human population. And it's so simply that 50,000 years ago there was one tiny human family, a mere 5,000 people, about that. There was -- they all interbred with each other, all each other's cousins. We all looked exactly alike. But as soon as we spread out from Africa and started to live on the far-flung continents around the world, there was no longer any intermixing. Now, the genome doesn't stand still. It's mutating all the time. So this meant that on each continent, each population started to evolve independently to all the others. And to respond to the local environmental stresses, whatever those were. It's hardly surprising that we do differ from each other in certain ways. We differ in sort of skin and hair color and skeleton, the obvious ways. Maybe we differ in other ways, behavioral ways, but we've yet to identify. It seems -- if you look at the genes that underly this, these are genes that have been selected for -- I should mention that there's kinds of change that go on in the genome. One is what geneticists call mutual evolution, the changes in the DNA that don't do any, don't make any difference, evolution doesn't care about them. And these are mutual genes. Most change is mutual. Only a very few changes are selected. In other words, nature has made them more common because they do something. And it looks like from the Pritchard(ph) paper you were describing just now, there are just probably quite a limited number of genes, maybe still 200 in each of the main continental races, that have been under selective pressure. And it's these genes that have probably driven the differentiation of the human species. FLATOW: In such a short period of time, such a great change. Mr. WADE: Yes. In a way it's not surprising because there was enormous change from 100,000 years ago, when we first took our present shape, to 50,000 years ago\u2026 FLATOW: Right. Mr. WADE: \u2026so 50,000 year span, there was enormous change. We can tell from the archaeological record we were -- we probably didn't even speak 100,000 years ago. We were just simple foragers, much like chimpanzees, maybe like Neanderthals. But 50,000 years ago, the archaeological record tells us, there's a whole suite of very sophisticated behaviors, probably prompted by the evolution of language. So if that amount of change can take place in that 50,000 year interval, we shouldn't be surprised that changes has also continued in the latter 50,000 year interval. FLATOW: All right. We're going to take a break, catch our breath, talk more with Nicholas Wade, author of Before the Dawn: Recovering the Lost History of Our Ancestors, go to the phones and take your calls, talking about evolution. We will get into, is evolution still going on? What might happen to the human race? Lots of good interesting things to talk about. Stay with us. We'll be right back. This is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. (Soundbite of news) You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow talking with Nicholas Wade who's a science reporter of the New York Times, author of the book, Before the Dawn: Recovering the Lost History of our Ancestors. The number, 1-800-989-8255. We were tracing the history of divergence occurred in human populations 50,000 years ago. You talked about them being, separating into different continents and sort of inbreeding. Would that be the right way of looking at it? Mr. WADE: Yes. That's right. FLATOW: Talking about isolated populations, you mentioned in your book that the Ashkenazi Jews are a good example of an isolated population that has undergone many genetic changes. Mr. WADE: Right. This was a surprise. But it's turned out from looking at the Y chromosome that the Jewish men from many different Jewish communities around the world all have the same Y chromosome. Now, it's not specific to Jews. It's a sort of generic Middle Eastern Y chromosome. And it also is -- it is proof not only that they all come from the same source from the Middle East but also that the community has interbred, at least obviously for religious reasons. FLATOW: Right. Mr. WADE: So - although I don't think this all could have been predicted, I mean, because people can convert to Judaism if they wish. Nonetheless, it has turned out that, at least until recent times, Jewish communities have been endogamous, or breeding within themselves. FLATOW: And what results in that? What comes out of that? You know, we hear about Tay-Sachs disease, for example, is a European Jewish disease. Mr. WADE: Well, lots of\u2026 FLATOW: What other kinds of things come out of that habit? Mr. WADE: Well, firstly because the Jewish genetic pool has been isolated for about 3,000 years, you can tell many fascinating things about Jewish history to do with Cohens(ph), for example, the priesthood descent from (unintelligible). FLATOW: Right. Mr. WADE: One of the most interesting things has to do with the genetic diseases that are common to many Jewish communities. And in particular, the Ashkenazi community has a set of Jewish diseases that shows very curious clustering. Now, diseases come about through mutations which hit randomly in the genome. So when you get the same pathway being hit, it's the sign that although the mutation (unintelligible) is a disease, there must be some benefit that far outweighs the downside of the disease. Now, we know with the case of malaria, which is a very recent disease, about 10,000 years ago, the evolution has to use whatever mutations it has at hand. And with malaria it's used, the sickle cell mutation and the Thalassemias in different populations, to make a quick fix to the threat of malaria. So coming back to the Ashkenazis, people have long puzzled, well, what is the upside of these mutations? To what disease does it afford protection? And there isn't one. No one can find any disease that these mutations help you with. But a very interesting theory has recently been advanced which is while during the Middle Ages, around 900 years, Ashkenazis lived in a different social niche from their host communities because of discrimination. They were forced to go into money lending, tax farming, professions which demanded a great deal of intellectual acumen. If you try and work out - remember, in the Middle Ages we didn't have the concept of zero. If you try and work out 17 percent of 3,000 without using zero\u2026 FLATOW: Right. Mr. WADE: \u2026it's not a straightforward computation. So for these reasons, it seems very possible that the mutations that were favored in the Ashkenazi communities were ones that promoted extra intelligence. Now, this is a\u2026 FLATOW: It must be a controversial theory. Mr. WADE: \u2026you know, when I wrote about it, no one wrote in to complain. But at the same time\u2026 FLATOW: Certainly no one Jewish wrote in to complain. But what your grandmother's been telling me as a Jewish person all these years, you know, it's backed up now by this theory. Mr. WADE: Well, the Jewish folk lore version, as I understand it, is that it was, of course, the Rabbis (unintelligible) the merchants and the Rabbis' sons married the merchant daughters. But this is -- there aren't enough Rabbis\u2026 FLATOW: Right. Mr. WADE: \u2026to make a real difference in population terms according to Henry Harpenton(ph), whose theory I'm reporting. It must have been something that happened over many generations to the population as a whole. FLATOW: Um hmm. Mr. WADE: But definitely, I mean, the interesting part of the hypothesis is that Ashkenazis have indeed made an enormous intellectual contribution way out of proportion to their numbers, on the one hand. And on the other hand, it's a very curious path of (unintelligible) and diseases. So the hypothesis links the two in a very plausible way with historical backing. And what remains is for it to be put to a test. I mean, it makes it, like a good scientific hypothesis, it makes a textbook prediction, which is that people who carry any of these mutations, and I think the figure is like 70 percent of Ashkanazis carry one or other of them. And they're usually not visible. They don't cause anything bad unless you carry two copies. People who carry these mutations should do slightly better on IQ tests than the average. No one has yet tested that thesis. FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255. Talking now with Nicholas Wade, author of, Before the Dawn: Recovering The Lost History of Our Ancestors, on TALK OF THE NATION SCIENCE FRIDAY. Let's go to the phones. Is that Nick in, what is it, Charles City, Iowa? NICK (Caller): Yes. FLATOW: Hi. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. NICK: Thank you. My comment kind of relates to what you had alluded to before the break, and that is, what do you see happening in the next few thousand years as far as physical changes, biological changes in the human body? Mr. WADE: Well, you can't predict for sure, but I think one can say there will be changed. I mean, if the world goes back into a new Ice Age, which will certainly happen sooner or later, we'll go through those bodily adaptations that suit you for the cold. We'll become all sort of rotund-like\u2026 FLATOW: Hairy? Are we going to get our hair back? Mr. WADE: Maybe we'll get our hair back if we don't need to sweat. You sure can't predict for sure, but I just think there will be changes. It's very unlikely that we'll stay exactly as we are. FLATOW: What about our brain? We always see, when you see science fiction or read science fiction movies, always the brain is evolving to this bigger state. Is that inevitable? Or could that go the opposite direction? Mr. WADE: Well, you know, I think this surely has been happening. In fact we've already found several brain genes that have been under evolution in the last 50,000 years. And this surely matches the growing complexity of our societies. I mean it's much more complex to operate in one of our societies, to perform the difficult jobs that we all do than to be a hunter and gatherer; and even though hunters and gatherers know an enormous amount about their environment and the plants and the animals, they're very skilled, resourceful people, but nonetheless, there are many concepts that they never had that you get with settling down. And there is surely greater need for intellectual capacity and our brains surely has been evolving fast over the last 15,000 years, certainly since settlement, and will continue to do so. FLATOW: Would it be able to, is it possible for us to track the changes while they're happening? Or are we inside the box and you can't see unless you're outside the box what's going on? Mr. WADE: We, at present, it's very hard to give a date more precise than a couple of thousand years, but that's partly for lack of data. So, when we are able to sequence someone's genome for a mere thousand dollars, which we're trying to do right now, and we have a mass of data, then I think we'll be able to see evolutionary changes as they happen. FLATOW: What would you, what kind of research, and you've been covering this for years, would you like to see? What kind of questions need to be answered or you think should be answered? I'm going to give you the blank check question I give to scientists, and you're close enough to one. I know you are. If you had all the money in the world, I give you a blank check and you can do some research, you could answer a couple of questions, what are some of the key questions that you would like answered about? Mr. WADE: In this subject here? FLATOW: Yeah. Yeah. Well, you could give me anything at all if you want. Where do the socks go in the laundry? That would be a good one! (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. WADE: Well, I mean, the standard unanswered questions are how did life begin. That is a problem that looks harder and harder the more we know about it. And the other, and the current one of course is how our brain works. So, but I'm looking at it through what the genome is telling us. You know, one of the most fascinating things about the Ashkanazi hypothesis that I described in such detail is that this pinpoints for us exactly which of the 20,000 or the 10,000 genes active in the brain are the ones you need to increase intelligence; if the hypothesis is correct. So it would be fascinating to, by the media of genetics, to understand how our brain is wired and how we can improve it in various ways. FLATOW: Find the intelligence gene? Mr. WADE: And there are bound to be a whole group of them. But we could find them, we could find the other genes that determine our human nature, that determines the aspects of it we less like. And we could think perhaps about trying to improve it. FLATOW: Well, you're saying that basically culture is influencing evolution here. Right? Mr. WADE: That, we know from the\u2026 FLATOW: So we're sort of influencing our own evolution by the kind of culture we create? Mr. WADE: Exactly. And I think that's why, I think that accounts for the progress that seems so obvious when you look at the human trajectory, from living, you know, the wildest hunters and gatherers to our civilized societies today. Evolutionary biologists do not have the word progress in their vocabulary, so how is it we've, how can you explain this progress? So I think the answer must be what you just put your finger on. We know from that lactose tolerance gene where people who kept cattle developed the genetic ability to digest milk in adulthood. We know that culture feeds back on the human genome. So that is a way for human choice to feed back on the human genome. So if you live in a society that favors trading conciliation over aggressiveness, and allows the trait as the conciliators to have more children than the warriors, then that would be a way for human nature to change in a way that supports more complex, more peaceful societies. And I believe that's exactly what has happened in history. Our societies are far more peaceful, complex, and cooperative than any time in the past. FLATOW: But you have to foster that then, for that to happen. If you want smarter people, you have to create a smarter culture. If you want peace, more peaceable people, a peaceful culture. Because then that will influence the evolutionary process. Is that what you're saying? Or am I putting words in your mouth? Mr. WADE: That's right, except we don't have to do it. It's been done for us. Because war-like societies, of which there have been many in history, have not won out over more peaceful societies. The more peaceful societies have prevailed and with them the more peaceful genomes. And that's why the arrow of progress has pointed upward, though not always so. Mostly upward, it's gone. FLATOW: But you have to be dominant then, whatever that culture is influencing? Mr. WADE: Well, that's nature's way. We are fortunate if peaceful, if societies that are on the whole peaceful have prevailed over ones that have been more war-like. FLATOW: Um hmm. We're talking about evolution and all kinds of stuff with culture this hour on TALK OF THE NATION SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. I'm Ira Flatow with Nicholas Wade, author of Before the Dawn: Recovering The Lost History of Our Ancestors. Let's talk about, in the few minutes we have left, the subtitle of your book, recovering the lost history of our ancestors. That is by looking through the genome? Mr. WADE: Right. FLATOW: And why is it a lost history? Because the fossil record is incomplete? Or we just, the genome is a better place to look for it? Mr. WADE: Well it, I think it's lost because there are so many, sort of blank pages in our history. You know, from about 50,000 years ago to 15,000, which is when you see the first settlements, there are almost no records left of what we did except for a few stone tools and the painted caves of Europe. It's all gone. So you might think it would be impossible ever to reconstruct what happened then, and yet the genome gives us a way of doing so. At least sketching out the broad outline of what was happening. FLATOW: But it couldn't tell us, you know, so-and-so lived in a certain place? Is it that precise that it could do that? Mr. WADE: You know it's going to be able to. There's going to be a grand synthesis which we can already see happening between genetics and archeology. Because the geneticists can say, well, the (unintelligible) nations, the people you archeologists call (unintelligible) nations from the stone tools you've found, we know these belong to lineage 453 of the genetic tree of the Y chromosome. So you can begin to link up genes with archeological sites and cultures. And the third ingredient of that, of course, is language. If you can work back, the tree of languages from those we speak today to the original mother tongue of the ancestry of the human population, you should be able to make language the third part of this synthesis between genetics and archeology. FLATOW: I remember asking Louie Leakey this question over 35 years ago when I first met him as a young scientist, as a young reporter, and I asked him what, you know, I was just sitting in this room in aw of Louie Leakey, I was in my 20s, and I had to come up with a question. And I asked him, what separates us from, you know, proto-humans and chimpanzees and whatever, and he's talking about the precision grip and tool-making abilities. That doesn't seem to be so true anymore, with the discovery of tool-making abilities of chimps and them teaching one another how to, you know, to make tools. Maybe not as precisely as making a watch. Mr. WARD: I think that's right, because Leakey at that time must just have discovered homo habilus and the first toolmaker. FLATOW: Yes. Right. MR. WARD: But the more we know of chimps, the more we realize how many of their abilities parallel our own, and in particular tool-making, although the binobos(ph) don't have that. FLATOW: Right. I always ask chimp people, you haven't studied binobo? We had a guest on and I asked, what's the difference between a binobo and a chimp? He said if I give an empty box to a chimp, two chimps with fight over it. If I give it to a binobo, they'll go inside and make love. (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: We're always confounded by the tiny bit of genetic difference between us and the chimps that account for so much. Mr. WARD: Well, I think that's right. You now, it's clear there must, it seems to me there must be a sort of set of genes that influence our social behavior. A sort of social template. And we and the chimps and binobos must all have inherited it from our common ancestor. But you just tweak it a little bit and you get societies as totally different as the chimp and the binobo. And you tweak it a bit more and you get our society, rather the variety of human societies. FLATOW: It's almost like the chaos theory. You just need, you know, a tiny little tweak and some big cascade. Mr. WARD: Except that it all makes sense because the tweaks are imposed by the environment. So if you live in an environment, say, in a settled society where you have resources that you, and surpluses that you've been able to store and hoard for the first time, then the people who sort of figure out how best to manage their surpluses will be the ones who have more children. And that way the society will sort of come to conform to that environment. FLATOW: Well, we've run out of time. It goes by fast, doesn't it? Mr. WADE: It sure does. FLATOW: Nicholas Wade, thank you for joining us today. He's the author of Before the Dawn: Recovering The Lost History of Our Ancestors. He's one of the great science writers of our time and he always writes terrific stuff. Thank you for taking time to be with us. Mr. WARD: Thank you, Ira. Thank you very much. FLATOW: You're welcome.  IRA FLATOW, host:  For the rest of the hour we're going to turn to evolution. Last month several researchers announced what they say is proof positive that we humans are still evolving. They scanned the human genome and found 700 genes that have appear to have responded to the pressure of natural selection within the last 10,000 years. Now that doesn't sound like, sounds like a long time, but, you know, it's a flip on the radar screen in terms of evolutionary history.  And there's some of the more interesting genes. Genes that allow us to digest lactose as adults, genes that influence skin color, bone structure. Now this news may surprise you, if you're one of many of us accustomed to thinking about evolution as a thing of the past or something that happens to other animals, not to us. But I'll bet my next guest was not-at-all surprised by this study.  He's written a book that makes the case that genetics is the backbone underlying every major evolutionary advance in our history and prehistory. That our genes hold a story that our evolution from apes to humans, our migration out of Africa and around the globe, our transition from hunter-gatherers to more complex societies, and our development of language and complex behaviors. This hour we're going to be talking about how DNA is re-writing our history, how evolution is still happening today, about the future evolution of human species. Could our human population one day become distinct species.  A lot to talk about, if you'd like to join in. Our number is 1-800-989-8255. Nicholas Wade is the author of BEFORE THE DAWN: RECOVERING THE LOST HISTORY OF OUR ANCESTORS, out this month from Penguin Press. Science reporter from The New York Times, here in New York, been a science reporter for decades, as long as I've been doing this, if not longer. He joins me here in our NPR studios. Welcome back to the program, Nick.  Mr. NICHOLAS WADE (Author, \"Before The Dawn\"): Thanks Ira.  FLATOW: What made you want to write this book, BEFORE THE DAWN? That's a typical question you ask of an author, but I know you do specialize in this field.  Mr. WADE: Well I, I found I was writing many stories about genetics, growing a human genome that was sequenced just three years ago, 2003, and many of them looks into dark corners of the human past that we, had been inaccessible before then. And I conceived the idea of writing this book focused on the most recent 50,000 years of our history. There are many books about fossil skulls and stone tools, and those end about 100,000 years ago. But 50,000 years ago I think is where it really starts to get interesting. That's when the ancestral human population lived. And many of these new genetic findings help explain aspects of our past that we would never have known about, otherwise. So in the book I've tried to weave together all the traditional disagreements that bear on the human past, archeology, paleo-anthropology, historical linguistics, with the thread of genetics as the common theme.  FLATOW: Do we actually carry with us all that history, going back 50/100 thousand years?  Mr. WADE: Well, we do, it's all in our genealogy and it's very ancient. It's changing all the time, but it has an ancient pedigree.  FLATOW: Uh huh. And how does that show up. How is it carried? You talk very interestingly about the y chromosome and the mitochondrial DNA, and how that's passed down. I thought that was fascinating. Explain that to us.  Mr. WADE: Well, the Y chromosome is a wonderful way of tracking our migrations across the globe from our ancestral homeland somewhere in northeast Africa, probably around Ethiopia. And the reason that is, is two-fold. First is, very surprisingly, everyone, every man carries the same y chromosome inherited from some genetic Adam who lived in the ancestral human population. Of course there are about 2,000 men in that early population but only one Y chromosome survived. And it's weird because in each generation, some men will have either daughters or no children. So their Y chromosomes will get extinct.  And in the small population, one gene or chromosome, whatever, will substitute for the others.  But the second reason is that although it's the same chromosome that all us men carry, mutations have built up on it generation by generation. And you can use these mutations to sort of create a tree and assign each man to a branch. And these branches still bear the geographical pattern of how we spread across the globe.  FLATOW: And as far as the female side?  Mr. WADE: Right. I should have mentioned, the Y chromosome is not shuffled between generations like all the rest of the genes. So that makes it very easy to track.  And there's one other part of the genome that doesn't get shuffled and that is the mitochondrial DNA which comes just through the mother because the sperm's mitochondria are destroyed when it fertilizes the egg. So only the mothers prevail.  FLATOW: One of the surprising things about the history of this, the following the DNAs, how the DNA evidence fits with the timeline of human evolution. It comes from the fossil evidence. How good a fit is it? And how do we know it's such a good fit?  Mr. WADE: Well, I think, I mean, it's what I regard as a forced fit because the genetic dates are very interesting. And they got it in a relative sense. They tell you A comes before B. But you should distrust the numbers that the geneticist put out when they say, well, mitochondrial E lived 128,000 years ago.  Yes, but it's give or take 50,000 years either way. So for really good dates, you know, it needs to go to the archaeology. And the carbon 14 dates are solid. You can go to the bank with them.  So I think one takes the relative -- if you've got a genetic tree of whatever, the Y chromosome and going across the world, their are branch points on it, each of which can be taken in a relative sense. But for an absolute date, you just need to fix one branch with an archaeological date and that allows you to read off all the others in the relative terms.  FLATOW: Does the DNA fit more gaps than the fossil record does?  Mr. WADE: Well, it does in a sense in that the fossil record is inherently gappy but the genetic record is sort of complete and continuous. So you can get a fix on any gene you want simply by sampling enough genes in today's population and working backwards from those to whatever period you're interested in.  FLATOW: One of the biggest puzzles that we always talk about in evolution is at what joint, what point the ancestors of humans and chimps, where were they joint that they came from? Can DNA evidence provide any answers to that?  Mr. WADE: Well, it can because we have no fossils in that critical period when we and the chimps started to split apart\u2026  FLATOW: Right.  Mr. WADE: \u2026from our common ancestors. But you can draw up a genetic, a tree, if you look at the DNA of us and all the great apes. And that gives you a tree.  And the part of it you can date very well is when the orangutans branched off from the African apes. And with that date, which I think is like 12 million years ago, you can say, well, chimps and humans must have parted company about five million years ago.  FLATOW: Talking with Nicholas Wade, author of Before the Dawn: Recovering the Lost History of Our Ancestors, on TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. I'm Ira Flatow.  If we all have the, all we men, have the same Y chromosome from that one person 50,000 years ago, why do we all look so different and act so different, you know? What happened there?  Mr. WADE: Well, I think the answer there, you get into the previously murky subject of the genetic basis of race. So there's been what I would call a conspiracy of silence on this.  The geneticists have not really wanted to say much about it, for good reason. They really didn't know very much until recently. The social scientists have much preferred to say, well, race is a social construct. It's not biological. There's nothing genetic there. And we're all, all diversity is cultural.  So everyone's been sort of happy with that position. And there are good sort of historical reasons why we've taken that course.  But now that the geneticists are beginning to understand the genetic differentiation of the human population. And it's so simply that 50,000 years ago there was one tiny human family, a mere 5,000 people, about that. There was -- they all interbred with each other, all each other's cousins. We all looked exactly alike.  But as soon as we spread out from Africa and started to live on the far-flung continents around the world, there was no longer any intermixing. Now, the genome doesn't stand still. It's mutating all the time.  So this meant that on each continent, each population started to evolve independently to all the others. And to respond to the local environmental stresses, whatever those were. It's hardly surprising that we do differ from each other in certain ways. We differ in sort of skin and hair color and skeleton, the obvious ways. Maybe we differ in other ways, behavioral ways, but we've yet to identify.  It seems -- if you look at the genes that underly this, these are genes that have been selected for -- I should mention that there's kinds of change that go on in the genome. One is what geneticists call mutual evolution, the changes in the DNA that don't do any, don't make any difference, evolution doesn't care about them. And these are mutual genes.  Most change is mutual. Only a very few changes are selected. In other words, nature has made them more common because they do something. And it looks like from the Pritchard(ph) paper you were describing just now, there are just probably quite a limited number of genes, maybe still 200 in each of the main continental races, that have been under selective pressure.  And it's these genes that have probably driven the differentiation of the human species.  FLATOW: In such a short period of time, such a great change.  Mr. WADE: Yes. In a way it's not surprising because there was enormous change from 100,000 years ago, when we first took our present shape, to 50,000 years ago\u2026  FLATOW: Right.  Mr. WADE: \u2026so 50,000 year span, there was enormous change. We can tell from the archaeological record we were -- we probably didn't even speak 100,000 years ago. We were just simple foragers, much like chimpanzees, maybe like Neanderthals.  But 50,000 years ago, the archaeological record tells us, there's a whole suite of very sophisticated behaviors, probably prompted by the evolution of language.  So if that amount of change can take place in that 50,000 year interval, we shouldn't be surprised that changes has also continued in the latter 50,000 year interval.  FLATOW: All right. We're going to take a break, catch our breath, talk more with Nicholas Wade, author of Before the Dawn: Recovering the Lost History of Our Ancestors, go to the phones and take your calls, talking about evolution.  We will get into, is evolution still going on? What might happen to the human race? Lots of good interesting things to talk about. Stay with us. We'll be right back.  This is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.  (Soundbite of news)  You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow talking with Nicholas Wade who's a science reporter of the New York Times, author of the book, Before the Dawn: Recovering the Lost History of our Ancestors.  The number, 1-800-989-8255. We were tracing the history of divergence occurred in human populations 50,000 years ago. You talked about them being, separating into different continents and sort of inbreeding. Would that be the right way of looking at it?  Mr. WADE: Yes. That's right.  FLATOW: Talking about isolated populations, you mentioned in your book that the Ashkenazi Jews are a good example of an isolated population that has undergone many genetic changes.  Mr. WADE: Right. This was a surprise. But it's turned out from looking at the Y chromosome that the Jewish men from many different Jewish communities around the world all have the same Y chromosome.  Now, it's not specific to Jews. It's a sort of generic Middle Eastern Y chromosome. And it also is -- it is proof not only that they all come from the same source from the Middle East but also that the community has interbred, at least obviously for religious reasons.  FLATOW: Right.  Mr. WADE: So - although I don't think this all could have been predicted, I mean, because people can convert to Judaism if they wish. Nonetheless, it has turned out that, at least until recent times, Jewish communities have been endogamous, or breeding within themselves.  FLATOW: And what results in that? What comes out of that? You know, we hear about Tay-Sachs disease, for example, is a European Jewish disease.  Mr. WADE: Well, lots of\u2026  FLATOW: What other kinds of things come out of that habit?  Mr. WADE: Well, firstly because the Jewish genetic pool has been isolated for about 3,000 years, you can tell many fascinating things about Jewish history to do with Cohens(ph), for example, the priesthood descent from (unintelligible).  FLATOW: Right.  Mr. WADE: One of the most interesting things has to do with the genetic diseases that are common to many Jewish communities. And in particular, the Ashkenazi community has a set of Jewish diseases that shows very curious clustering.  Now, diseases come about through mutations which hit randomly in the genome. So when you get the same pathway being hit, it's the sign that although the mutation (unintelligible) is a disease, there must be some benefit that far outweighs the downside of the disease.  Now, we know with the case of malaria, which is a very recent disease, about 10,000 years ago, the evolution has to use whatever mutations it has at hand. And with malaria it's used, the sickle cell mutation and the Thalassemias in different populations, to make a quick fix to the threat of malaria.  So coming back to the Ashkenazis, people have long puzzled, well, what is the upside of these mutations? To what disease does it afford protection? And there isn't one. No one can find any disease that these mutations help you with.  But a very interesting theory has recently been advanced which is while during the Middle Ages, around 900 years, Ashkenazis lived in a different social niche from their host communities because of discrimination. They were forced to go into money lending, tax farming, professions which demanded a great deal of intellectual acumen.  If you try and work out - remember, in the Middle Ages we didn't have the concept of zero. If you try and work out 17 percent of 3,000 without using zero\u2026  FLATOW: Right.  Mr. WADE: \u2026it's not a straightforward computation. So for these reasons, it seems very possible that the mutations that were favored in the Ashkenazi communities were ones that promoted extra intelligence.  Now, this is a\u2026  FLATOW: It must be a controversial theory.  Mr. WADE: \u2026you know, when I wrote about it, no one wrote in to complain. But at the same time\u2026  FLATOW: Certainly no one Jewish wrote in to complain. But what your grandmother's been telling me as a Jewish person all these years, you know, it's backed up now by this theory.  Mr. WADE: Well, the Jewish folk lore version, as I understand it, is that it was, of course, the Rabbis (unintelligible) the merchants and the Rabbis' sons married the merchant daughters. But this is -- there aren't enough Rabbis\u2026  FLATOW: Right.  Mr. WADE: \u2026to make a real difference in population terms according to Henry Harpenton(ph), whose theory I'm reporting. It must have been something that happened over many generations to the population as a whole.  FLATOW: Um hmm.  Mr. WADE: But definitely, I mean, the interesting part of the hypothesis is that Ashkenazis have indeed made an enormous intellectual contribution way out of proportion to their numbers, on the one hand. And on the other hand, it's a very curious path of (unintelligible) and diseases.  So the hypothesis links the two in a very plausible way with historical backing. And what remains is for it to be put to a test. I mean, it makes it, like a good scientific hypothesis, it makes a textbook prediction, which is that people who carry any of these mutations, and I think the figure is like 70 percent of Ashkanazis carry one or other of them. And they're usually not visible. They don't cause anything bad unless you carry two copies.  People who carry these mutations should do slightly better on IQ tests than the average. No one has yet tested that thesis.  FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255.

My comment kind of relates to what you had alluded to before the break, and that is, what do you see happening in the next few thousand years as far as physical changes, biological changes in the human body?  Mr. WADE: Well, you can't predict for sure, but I think one can say there will be changed. I mean, if the world goes back into a new Ice Age, which will certainly happen sooner or later, we'll go through those bodily adaptations that suit you for the cold. We'll become all sort of rotund-like\u2026  FLATOW: Hairy? Are we going to get our hair back?  Mr. WADE: Maybe we'll get our hair back if we don't need to sweat. You sure can't predict for sure, but I just think there will be changes.  It's very unlikely that we'll stay exactly as we are.  FLATOW: What about our brain? We always see, when you see science fiction or read science fiction movies, always the brain is evolving to this bigger state. Is that inevitable? Or could that go the opposite direction?  Mr. WADE: Well, you know, I think this surely has been happening. In fact we've already found several brain genes that have been under evolution in the last 50,000 years. And this surely matches the growing complexity of our societies. I mean it's much more complex to operate in one of our societies, to perform the difficult jobs that we all do than to be a hunter and gatherer; and even though hunters and gatherers know an enormous amount about their environment and the plants and the animals, they're very skilled, resourceful people, but nonetheless, there are many concepts that they never had that you get with settling down. And there is surely greater need for intellectual capacity and our brains surely has been evolving fast over the last 15,000 years, certainly since settlement, and will continue to do so.  FLATOW: Would it be able to, is it possible for us to track the changes while they're happening? Or are we inside the box and you can't see unless you're outside the box what's going on?  Mr. WADE: We, at present, it's very hard to give a date more precise than a couple of thousand years, but that's partly for lack of data. So, when we are able to sequence someone's genome for a mere thousand dollars, which we're trying to do right now, and we have a mass of data, then I think we'll be able to see evolutionary changes as they happen.  FLATOW: What would you, what kind of research, and you've been covering this for years, would you like to see? What kind of questions need to be answered or you think should be answered? I'm going to give you the blank check question I give to scientists, and you're close enough to one. I know you are. If you had all the money in the world, I give you a blank check and you can do some research, you could answer a couple of questions, what are some of the key questions that you would like answered about?  Mr. WADE: In this subject here?  FLATOW: Yeah. Yeah. Well, you could give me anything at all if you want. Where do the socks go in the laundry? That would be a good one!  (Soundbite of laughter)  Mr. WADE: Well, I mean, the standard unanswered questions are how did life begin. That is a problem that looks harder and harder the more we know about it. And the other, and the current one of course is how our brain works. So, but I'm looking at it through what the genome is telling us.  You know, one of the most fascinating things about the Ashkanazi hypothesis that I described in such detail is that this pinpoints for us exactly which of the 20,000 or the 10,000 genes active in the brain are the ones you need to increase intelligence; if the hypothesis is correct. So it would be fascinating to, by the media of genetics, to understand how our brain is wired and how we can improve it in various ways.  FLATOW: Find the intelligence gene?  Mr. WADE: And there are bound to be a whole group of them. But we could find them, we could find the other genes that determine our human nature, that determines the aspects of it we less like. And we could think perhaps about trying to improve it.  FLATOW: Well, you're saying that basically culture is influencing evolution here. Right?  Mr. WADE: That, we know from the\u2026  FLATOW: So we're sort of influencing our own evolution by the kind of culture we create?  Mr. WADE: Exactly. And I think that's why, I think that accounts for the progress that seems so obvious when you look at the human trajectory, from living, you know, the wildest hunters and gatherers to our civilized societies today.  Evolutionary biologists do not have the word progress in their vocabulary, so how is it we've, how can you explain this progress? So I think the answer must be what you just put your finger on. We know from that lactose tolerance gene where people who kept cattle developed the genetic ability to digest milk in adulthood. We know that culture feeds back on the human genome. So that is a way for human choice to feed back on the human genome.  So if you live in a society that favors trading conciliation over aggressiveness, and allows the trait as the conciliators to have more children than the warriors, then that would be a way for human nature to change in a way that supports more complex, more peaceful societies. And I believe that's exactly what has happened in history.  Our societies are far more peaceful, complex, and cooperative than any time in the past.  FLATOW: But you have to foster that then, for that to happen. If you want smarter people, you have to create a smarter culture. If you want peace, more peaceable people, a peaceful culture. Because then that will influence the evolutionary process. Is that what you're saying? Or am I putting words in your mouth?  Mr. WADE: That's right, except we don't have to do it. It's been done for us. Because war-like societies, of which there have been many in history, have not won out over more peaceful societies. The more peaceful societies have prevailed and with them the more peaceful genomes. And that's why the arrow of progress has pointed upward, though not always so. Mostly upward, it's gone.  FLATOW: But you have to be dominant then, whatever that culture is influencing?  Mr. WADE: Well, that's nature's way. We are fortunate if peaceful, if societies that are on the whole peaceful have prevailed over ones that have been more war-like.  FLATOW: Um hmm. We're talking about evolution and all kinds of stuff with culture this hour on TALK OF THE NATION SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.  I'm Ira Flatow with Nicholas Wade, author of Before the Dawn: Recovering The Lost History of Our Ancestors.  Let's talk about, in the few minutes we have left, the subtitle of your book, recovering the lost history of our ancestors. That is by looking through the genome?  Mr. WADE: Right.  FLATOW: And why is it a lost history? Because the fossil record is incomplete? Or we just, the genome is a better place to look for it?  Mr. WADE: Well it, I think it's lost because there are so many, sort of blank pages in our history. You know, from about 50,000 years ago to 15,000, which is when you see the first settlements, there are almost no records left of what we did except for a few stone tools and the painted caves of Europe. It's all gone. So you might think it would be impossible ever to reconstruct what happened then, and yet the genome gives us a way of doing so. At least sketching out the broad outline of what was happening.  FLATOW: But it couldn't tell us, you know, so-and-so lived in a certain place? Is it that precise that it could do that?  Mr. WADE: You know it's going to be able to. There's going to be a grand synthesis which we can already see happening between genetics and archeology. Because the geneticists can say, well, the (unintelligible) nations, the people you archeologists call (unintelligible) nations from the stone tools you've found, we know these belong to lineage 453 of the genetic tree of the Y chromosome. So you can begin to link up genes with archeological sites and cultures.  And the third ingredient of that, of course, is language. If you can work back, the tree of languages from those we speak today to the original mother tongue of the ancestry of the human population, you should be able to make language the third part of this synthesis between genetics and archeology.  FLATOW: I remember asking Louie Leakey this question over 35 years ago when I first met him as a young scientist, as a young reporter, and I asked him what, you know, I was just sitting in this room in aw of Louie Leakey, I was in my 20s, and I had to come up with a question. And I asked him, what separates us from, you know, proto-humans and chimpanzees and whatever, and he's talking about the precision grip and tool-making abilities. That doesn't seem to be so true anymore, with the discovery of tool-making abilities of chimps and them teaching one another how to, you know, to make tools. Maybe not as precisely as making a watch.  Mr. WARD: I think that's right, because Leakey at that time must just have discovered homo habilus and the first toolmaker.  FLATOW: Yes. Right.  MR. WARD: But the more we know of chimps, the more we realize how many of their abilities parallel our own, and in particular tool-making, although the binobos(ph) don't have that.  FLATOW: Right. I always ask chimp people, you haven't studied binobo? We had a guest on and I asked, what's the difference between a binobo and a chimp? He said if I give an empty box to a chimp, two chimps with fight over it. If I give it to a binobo, they'll go inside and make love.  (Soundbite of laughter)  FLATOW: We're always confounded by the tiny bit of genetic difference between us and the chimps that account for so much.  Mr. WARD: Well, I think that's right. You now, it's clear there must, it seems to me there must be a sort of set of genes that influence our social behavior. A sort of social template. And we and the chimps and binobos must all have inherited it from our common ancestor.  But you just tweak it a little bit and you get societies as totally different as the chimp and the binobo. And you tweak it a bit more and you get our society, rather the variety of human societies.  FLATOW: It's almost like the chaos theory. You just need, you know, a tiny little tweak and some big cascade.  Mr. WARD: Except that it all makes sense because the tweaks are imposed by the environment. So if you live in an environment, say, in a settled society where you have resources that you, and surpluses that you've been able to store and hoard for the first time, then the people who sort of figure out how best to manage their surpluses will be the ones who have more children. And that way the society will sort of come to conform to that environment.  FLATOW: Well, we've run out of time. It goes by fast, doesn't it?  Mr. WADE: It sure does.  FLATOW: Nicholas Wade, thank you for joining us today. He's the author of Before the Dawn: Recovering The Lost History of Our Ancestors. He's one of the great science writers of our time and he always writes terrific stuff.  Thank you for taking time to be with us.  Mr. WARD: Thank you, Ira. Thank you very much.

I'm Joe Palca. For the rest of this hour, we turn to a study of the brain that appears in the journal Science today. You know that feeling you get when you're sitting in the dentist's office waiting for a root canal? Or, for me, it's a feeling of when I go into a waiting room and I know I'm going to have my blood drawn and I kind of, ugh, I don't want that to happen. Well, there's a new study that has identified the place in the brain where these feelings of dread originate, and it's not the part of the brain that involves fear of the unpleasant event. The discovery also suggests ways we may be able to get past that dread. The study's lead author joins me now to talk about his research and what it means for us when we're faced with dreadful situations. Gregory Berns is the author of Satisfaction: The Science of Finding True Fulfillment, and he's an associate professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia. He joins me today from the campus there. Welcome back to the program, Dr. Berns. Dr. GREGORY BERNS (Author, Satisfaction: The Science of Finding True Fulfillment; Professor, Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Emory University): Great to be here, Joe. PALCA: And if you'd like to join our discussion, give us a call. Our number is 800-989-8255; that's 1-800-989-TALK. And, as always, there's more information about this topic on our website, www. sciencefriday. com. And, Gregory Berns, I can't resist, sort of saying, I guess it's just not painful dread we're talking about here, but I'm sure some people have that feeling of dread when they know they have to appear on live radio like TALK OF THE NATION. Dr. BERNS: Well, yeah, that's right. You just want to get it over with, I suppose. PALCA: I hope that's not the case with you, at least. Dr. BERNS: Not at all. PALCA: Okay. Dr. BERNS: Love to be here. PALCA: So, what were you looking for here? How do you study something as vague as this feeling we have called dread? Dr. BERNS: Well, yeah. The thing about dread is, like you said, it seems to be very vague. It seems to be this kind of emotion that floats there and makes you do things that seem a little bit irrational. And the way you approach this problem is, you basically look into the brain. And the study that we did is actually part of a growing field in neuroeconomics. And what neuroeconomics is, is like the name sounds: it's the merging of neuroscience methods with problems that economists typically study. And, you may think that. . . PALCA: Yeah, I was just going to say--the economy of dread? Dr. BERNS: Well, yeah, exactly. So, dread doesn't really sound like a problem that economists would be interested in, but, in fact, it is really a very interesting problem. And it impacts our decisions because, as you point out, when you're doing things, or specifically, when you're waiting for things that you know are unpleasant, the feeling of dread can sometimes be so overpowering that the waiting is the worst part, and you may actually end up doing things that you might not do otherwise. So, for example, in our study, we were studying the effect of pain and how that causes the feeling of dread. And one thing that's very peculiar about pain is, obviously, you want to get rid of the shock as quickly as possible, in terms of how the voltage is. So, basically, what we did was we had participants undergoing brain imaging, and what we did was we wired up their feet with a little electrode and we administered small electric shocks. Now, nobody likes these electric shocks and what we were interested in is what it's like to wait for them. And so this is exactly the phenomena that you described sitting there in the doctor's office or waiting for the dentist to come in. You just want the thing over with. PALCA: Right. Dr. BERNS: Some people really hate this, and, basically, what they're telling us is, you know, I really hate waiting and, you know, I would actually rather take a larger shock than wait any further for this. PALCA: So, what you're doing, I guess, the reason you're putting them in this brain imager, is you're trying to find, what? What parts of the brain seem to be turned on or active or what, when this feeling is experienced? Dr. BERNS: Well, we want to know two things. The first thing is we want to understand what dread is and, like you pointed out, it's very hard to know that simply by asking people, because it's a vague emotion. So, by using brain imaging, we can understand what dread is by where in the brain it manifests itself. So the way we did that is we focus on a network of areas known as the pain matrix, because, after all, people, in this case, are waiting for something painful. Now, pain is interesting, because it's not something that's just a matter of hurting. I mean, pain is actually comprised of things like how hard a person is stimulated, whether it's scratching, or whether it's a burn, how hot or how hard. These things affect you. But it's also affected by things like attention and by things like emotion. And all of these things augment or increase the amount of pain that a person experiences. Now, we can map these different functions onto parts of the brain, and by looking at what happens in these different parts of the brain while a person is waiting for something unpleasant, we can see what aspect of this phenomena, whether it's attention or emotion or something else that gives rise to dread. PALCA: And the punchline? Dr. BERNS: Well, the punchline is that dread is not something as simple as fear or anxiety, as you might think. It actually has a lot to do with the attention that you devote to the part of the body that's about to be hurt. And the way we know that is because, in the group of people we studied, there were basically mild versions of it, and there were extreme versions of it; and these extreme dreaders, as we called them, were people who couldn't stand to wait so much that they just were willing to take, actually, a more painful shock rather than wait for a less painful one, which is, on the surface, quite illogical. PALCA: Yeah. Yeah. All right. Well, that's an interesting set of circumstances and we have a lot of people waiting to ask questions about it. So let's take a call now, and go first to Landon(ph) in Oklahoma City. Landon, welcome to Science Friday. Hello? LANDON (Caller): I was just wondering if you noticed a similar phenomenon, I guess, in situations where people were anticipating things that are happy rather than things that they're not looking forward to. PALCA: So sort of the flip-side of dread, you would say? LANDON: Yes. PALCA: Okay. Gregory Berns, is there something in that, or is that not your study? Dr. BERNS: Well, it's not our study, although that phenomena you might appropriately call savoring. So a good example of that would be a fine meal, where you would want to make it last as long as possible, perhaps. And we didn't study that, because it's actually a little bit difficult to make people experience pleasurable things in the scanner. It's much easier to make them feel unpleasant things. PALCA: I see. Landon, thanks for that call. Let's take another call now and go to Robert(ph) in Waco, Texas. Robert, welcome to the program. ROBERT (Caller): Hello? PALCA: Hello. ROBERT: Yes. PALCA: Your question? You're on the air. ROBERT: My question is, as far as a fear of flying--I had a bad experience on a near crash landing on a plane, and ever since then I have not flown again. The feeling that I get as I get to an airport falls more under dread. And sort of waiting for turbulence to happen, it's not like I think the plane's going to go down, it's just I'm sort of dreading that whole experience. PALCA: And let me just say, just to be clear here, when you get on the plane, are you still a white-knuckle flier, or is it you're okay once you're doing it? ROBERT: No. No. Still white-knuckle flier. PALCA: Okay, so there is dread in anticipation and then, at least, fear during. What would you say about that Gregory Berns? Dr. BERNS: Well, those are a combination of emotions I think going on, and that's a really good example of how feelings of dread and anxiety make us do things that we really think are illogical. Because I'm assuming that you have to fly or you would like to fly places rather than drive. ROBERT: I'd like to fly, but the last time I tried, I purchased the tickets and then ended up having to cancel it because I could not bring myself to get on the plane. PALCA: Wow. Dr. BERNS: Yes, that sounds like a pretty severe case of dread and anxiety. Now, what our findings suggest about that is one of the key aspects about dread, that I don't think we fully appreciated before, was the effect of attention. So one of the things that I think can be helpful in these circumstances is distraction. Because when you're sitting there in the airport or whether you're driving to the airport, I mean, you're really only thinking about one thing and that is getting on the plane. And we can assume that, if you distract yourself, or at least try to distract yourself, it will probably decrease the dread. ROBERT: Well, I've found that if I take music with me or something else to listen to for the length of the flight, and I sort of gauge that, that this is a two-hour flight so I need two hours of music, I use that as sort of a helpful distraction. And I also use different homeopathy remedies to sort of calm that anxiety. PALCA: Robert, it's an interesting problem, but I like this idea, Greg Berns--and thanks for your call, Robert--I like this idea of distraction, but at some point, your attention tends to wander back to the thing you're dreading. Dr. BERNS: Yeah, that's the problem. I mean, the thing that you're dreading ultimately does approach; and the issue is, you know, how much can you take your mind off of it. PALCA: Okay, let's take another call to take our mind off of this. No, I'm just kidding. And go to Mark(ph), in, is it Truckee, California? MARK (Caller): Hi. Yes. PALCA: Mark, welcome. MARK: I had a question--I had read a book, \"Poe's Heart and the Mountain Climber,\" where it talks specifically about fear and anxiety and the difference. And you're talking, today, about pain and dread. And I was wondering if you could elaborate more on--are these the same thing, just looked at in different angles? Or are they very specifically different: anxiety versus dread, fear versus pain. They sound like kind of different sides f the same thing. Dr. BERNS: That's an excellent question, and I get asked this a lot. Now, I--just try to imagine what this experiment is like so--we have people lying on their back in an MRI scanner and we have electrodes on their foot. And they've already experienced it, because we gave them test shocks. And, basically, what it feels like is a sharp needle jab. Now, what's actually happening is we give them a signal at the beginning of each trial that says you have to wait anywhere from, say, one second to almost 30 seconds. Now, I think what's happening, and I can vouch for this, having done the experiment myself, is that it's not so much the fear of the pain in this case, it's just that you just can't stand waiting for it. And it's the waiting itself that's the thing that people want to avoid. And that's, I think, what we're talking about here with dread. Because people aren't afraid of the pain, per se, it's more like they're afraid of the waiting; and it's the case that you build these things up in your mind that are so much greater than the actual event itself, that the shock or the pain actually provides relief from dread. So I think it is a little bit different than fear or anxiety, because the people aren't afraid and they're not really even anxious, I think, by the same kind of definition. It's really almost a, it's like an, oh my God, do I have to wait for this thing? Just get it over with. And that's a little bit different. PALCA: Is that clear, Mark? MARK: Yes, it is. And if I understand, then the person going, say, to get a shot, the dread would occur when they actually sit down in the chair, whereas the anxiety is more about going to the doctor in general. Is that correct? Dr. BERNS: It could be--it could be both. I think what we noticed in this experiment is that a piece of information, and it's hard to know because we're being bombarded with things like this, but it was actually the information that we gave to the person that said you're going to be shocked and you have to wait this long, which is what triggers this dread response. So the example of the doctor is--you kind of--there could be several phases where you experience dread: one is when you make the appointment, one is when you get in the car, and then one is when you're sitting in the office. And kind of--each one of these gives like a little bump in your dread response. PALCA: Hmm. Interesting. Mark, thanks for that call. And we're talking with Gregory Berns, who's performed this really interesting experiment that attempts to get at where in the brain this feeling that we're all familiar with, called dread, comes from. I'm Joe Palca, and this is TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. Dr. Berns, I want to ask a question that's always bothered me. And that is, this notion that--tell me first of all, what exactly--when these people get into these brain scanners, what are--what's being measured in this scan? Dr. BERNS: That's an excellent question, Joe. Basically, what we're doing is taking movies of the brain. And what the measurement itself is, is actually blood flow. It turns out that the brain is kind of like a muscle that, when certain parts are being used, they recruit more blood to it because they're using oxygen and their metabolism is increasing and so they need more blood. And that is, in fact, what we're measuring. PALCA: I see. But--so just to follow that example. The thing that's always bothered me is if you say, okay, a muscle needs more energy, well, you can see that because someone runs or they lift weights or something like that, but it seems to me that there's, somewhere there's a leap of faith to say, okay, this brain muscle is doing something, but what it's related to may be dread or it may be, you know, when you experience these feelings of dread you simultaneously experience feelings of ennui, in another, you know, something like that. And so it seems to me very hard to know what this extra blood flow, in this particular case, actually signifies. Dr. BERNS: Yes. I mean, that's what--one thing we've learned about the brain is that if you have, kind of a pet emotion, whether it's dread or fear or love or happiness, it's almost certainly the case that you can't point to one single region and say, aha! That's the part of the brain that does that. So one thing that we've learned is that all of these functions, whether they're things like attention or emotions, are generally accomplished by a network of regions. And so, since these are networks, they can be kind of put together in different ways to accomplish the functions. Now, I think we've gotten more sophisticated with brain imaging these days and it's not simply that we're just saying, well, this part of the brain is more active or it's not. In fact, what we did was actually looked at the time course of that activity and its relationship to the specific events in our experiment. And we have some theory to go on here. Actually, as economic theory, strangely enough, that--there are a few theories out there that predict what happens while people are waiting for things. And it's quite perverse, because waiting is not really an event, it's just a state of mind. PALCA: Right. Dr. BERNS: And so we're specifically looking for patterns of activity that followed a particular time course; namely one that was highest when we presented the cue that said you have to wait, and then actually declined as the shock approached. So this is different than anxiety, because anxiety would be expected to grow as the shock approached in time. But dread is something different, because you can actually see it in people when they're doing this. It's when they get shocked they actually breathe a sigh of relief. And it's the relief from the dread. PALCA: Well, I don't know, Dr. Berns, if you felt dread by appearing on this program, but I can now tell you that I'm relieving you of the dread, because I'm afraid we've run out of time. But thanks very much for joining us. Dr. BERNS: My pleasure.

And one thing that's very peculiar about pain is, obviously, you want to get rid of the shock as quickly as possible, in terms of how the voltage is. So, basically, what we did was we had participants undergoing brain imaging, and what we did was we wired up their feet with a little electrode and we administered small electric shocks.  Now, nobody likes these electric shocks and what we were interested in is what it's like to wait for them. And so this is exactly the phenomena that you described sitting there in the doctor's office or waiting for the dentist to come in. You just want the thing over with.  PALCA: Right.  Dr. BERNS: Some people really hate this, and, basically, what they're telling us is, you know, I really hate waiting and, you know, I would actually rather take a larger shock than wait any further for this.  PALCA: So, what you're doing, I guess, the reason you're putting them in this brain imager, is you're trying to find, what? What parts of the brain seem to be turned on or active or what, when this feeling is experienced?  Dr. BERNS: Well, we want to know two things. The first thing is we want to understand what dread is and, like you pointed out, it's very hard to know that simply by asking people, because it's a vague emotion. So, by using brain imaging, we can understand what dread is by where in the brain it manifests itself. So the way we did that is we focus on a network of areas known as the pain matrix, because, after all, people, in this case, are waiting for something painful.  Now, pain is interesting, because it's not something that's just a matter of hurting. I mean, pain is actually comprised of things like how hard a person is stimulated, whether it's scratching, or whether it's a burn, how hot or how hard. These things affect you. But it's also affected by things like attention and by things like emotion. And all of these things augment or increase the amount of pain that a person experiences.  Now, we can map these different functions onto parts of the brain, and by looking at what happens in these different parts of the brain while a person is waiting for something unpleasant, we can see what aspect of this phenomena, whether it's attention or emotion or something else that gives rise to dread.  PALCA: And the punchline?  Dr. BERNS: Well, the punchline is that dread is not something as simple as fear or anxiety, as you might think. It actually has a lot to do with the attention that you devote to the part of the body that's about to be hurt.  And the way we know that is because, in the group of people we studied, there were basically mild versions of it, and there were extreme versions of it; and these extreme dreaders, as we called them, were people who couldn't stand to wait so much that they just were willing to take, actually, a more painful shock rather than wait for a less painful one, which is, on the surface, quite illogical.  PALCA: Yeah. Yeah. All right. Well, that's an interesting set of circumstances and we have a lot of people waiting to ask questions about it. So let's take a call now, and go first to Landon(ph) in Oklahoma City.  Landon, welcome to Science Friday. Hello?  LANDON (Caller): I was just wondering if you noticed a similar phenomenon, I guess, in situations where people were anticipating things that are happy rather than things that they're not looking forward to.  PALCA: So sort of the flip-side of dread, you would say?  LANDON: Yes.  PALCA: Okay. Gregory Berns, is there something in that, or is that not your study?  Dr. BERNS: Well, it's not our study, although that phenomena you might appropriately call savoring. So a good example of that would be a fine meal, where you would want to make it last as long as possible, perhaps. And we didn't study that, because it's actually a little bit difficult to make people experience pleasurable things in the scanner. It's much easier to make them feel unpleasant things.  PALCA: I see. Landon, thanks for that call. Let's take another call now and go to Robert(ph) in Waco, Texas.  Robert, welcome to the program.  ROBERT (Caller): Hello?  PALCA: Hello.  ROBERT: Yes.  PALCA: Your question? You're on the air.  ROBERT: My question is, as far as a fear of flying--I had a bad experience on a near crash landing on a plane, and ever since then I have not flown again. The feeling that I get as I get to an airport falls more under dread. And sort of waiting for turbulence to happen, it's not like I think the plane's going to go down, it's just I'm sort of dreading that whole experience.  PALCA: And let me just say, just to be clear here, when you get on the plane, are you still a white-knuckle flier, or is it you're okay once you're doing it?  ROBERT: No. No. Still white-knuckle flier.  PALCA: Okay, so there is dread in anticipation and then, at least, fear during. What would you say about that Gregory Berns?  Dr. BERNS: Well, those are a combination of emotions I think going on, and that's a really good example of how feelings of dread and anxiety make us do things that we really think are illogical. Because I'm assuming that you have to fly or you would like to fly places rather than drive.  ROBERT: I'd like to fly, but the last time I tried, I purchased the tickets and then ended up having to cancel it because I could not bring myself to get on the plane.  PALCA: Wow.  Dr. BERNS: Yes, that sounds like a pretty severe case of dread and anxiety. Now, what our findings suggest about that is one of the key aspects about dread, that I don't think we fully appreciated before, was the effect of attention. So one of the things that I think can be helpful in these circumstances is distraction. Because when you're sitting there in the airport or whether you're driving to the airport, I mean, you're really only thinking about one thing and that is getting on the plane. And we can assume that, if you distract yourself, or at least try to distract yourself, it will probably decrease the dread.  ROBERT: Well, I've found that if I take music with me or something else to listen to for the length of the flight, and I sort of gauge that, that this is a two-hour flight so I need two hours of music, I use that as sort of a helpful distraction. And I also use different homeopathy remedies to sort of calm that anxiety.  PALCA: Robert, it's an interesting problem, but I like this idea, Greg Berns--and thanks for your call, Robert--I like this idea of distraction, but at some point, your attention tends to wander back to the thing you're dreading.  Dr. BERNS: Yeah, that's the problem. I mean, the thing that you're dreading ultimately does approach; and the issue is, you know, how much can you take your mind off of it.  PALCA: Okay, let's take another call to take our mind off of this. No, I'm just kidding. And go to Mark(ph), in, is it Truckee, California?  MARK (Caller): Hi. Yes.  PALCA: Mark, welcome.  MARK: I had a question--I had read a book, \"Poe's Heart and the Mountain Climber,\" where it talks specifically about fear and anxiety and the difference. And you're talking, today, about pain and dread. And I was wondering if you could elaborate more on--are these the same thing, just looked at in different angles? Or are they very specifically different: anxiety versus dread, fear versus pain. They sound like kind of different sides f the same thing.  Dr. BERNS: That's an excellent question, and I get asked this a lot. Now, I--just try to imagine what this experiment is like so--we have people lying on their back in an MRI scanner and we have electrodes on their foot. And they've already experienced it, because we gave them test shocks. And, basically, what it feels like is a sharp needle jab.  Now, what's actually happening is we give them a signal at the beginning of each trial that says you have to wait anywhere from, say, one second to almost 30 seconds. Now, I think what's happening, and I can vouch for this, having done the experiment myself, is that it's not so much the fear of the pain in this case, it's just that you just can't stand waiting for it. And it's the waiting itself that's the thing that people want to avoid. And that's, I think, what we're talking about here with dread.  Because people aren't afraid of the pain, per se, it's more like they're afraid of the waiting; and it's the case that you build these things up in your mind that are so much greater than the actual event itself, that the shock or the pain actually provides relief from dread.  So I think it is a little bit different than fear or anxiety, because the people aren't afraid and they're not really even anxious, I think, by the same kind of definition. It's really almost a, it's like an, oh my God, do I have to wait for this thing? Just get it over with. And that's a little bit different.  PALCA: Is that clear, Mark?  MARK: Yes, it is. And if I understand, then the person going, say, to get a shot, the dread would occur when they actually sit down in the chair, whereas the anxiety is more about going to the doctor in general. Is that correct?  Dr. BERNS: It could be--it could be both. I think what we noticed in this experiment is that a piece of information, and it's hard to know because we're being bombarded with things like this, but it was actually the information that we gave to the person that said you're going to be shocked and you have to wait this long, which is what triggers this dread response. So the example of the doctor is--you kind of--there could be several phases where you experience dread: one is when you make the appointment, one is when you get in the car, and then one is when you're sitting in the office. And kind of--each one of these gives like a little bump in your dread response.  PALCA: Hmm. Interesting. Mark, thanks for that call.  And we're talking with Gregory Berns, who's performed this really interesting experiment that attempts to get at where in the brain this feeling that we're all familiar with, called dread, comes from.  I'm Joe Palca, and this is TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.  Dr. Berns, I want to ask a question that's always bothered me. And that is, this notion that--tell me first of all, what exactly--when these people get into these brain scanners, what are--what's being measured in this scan?  Dr. BERNS: That's an excellent question, Joe. Basically, what we're doing is taking movies of the brain. And what the measurement itself is, is actually blood flow. It turns out that the brain is kind of like a muscle that, when certain parts are being used, they recruit more blood to it because they're using oxygen and their metabolism is increasing and so they need more blood. And that is, in fact, what we're measuring.  PALCA: I see. But--so just to follow that example. The thing that's always bothered me is if you say, okay, a muscle needs more energy, well, you can see that because someone runs or they lift weights or something like that, but it seems to me that there's, somewhere there's a leap of faith to say, okay, this brain muscle is doing something, but what it's related to may be dread or it may be, you know, when you experience these feelings of dread you simultaneously experience feelings of ennui, in another, you know, something like that. And so it seems to me very hard to know what this extra blood flow, in this particular case, actually signifies.  Dr. BERNS: Yes. I mean, that's what--one thing we've learned about the brain is that if you have, kind of a pet emotion, whether it's dread or fear or love or happiness, it's almost certainly the case that you can't point to one single region and say, aha! That's the part of the brain that does that. So one thing that we've learned is that all of these functions, whether they're things like attention or emotions, are generally accomplished by a network of regions.  And so, since these are networks, they can be kind of put together in different ways to accomplish the functions. Now, I think we've gotten more sophisticated with brain imaging these days and it's not simply that we're just saying, well, this part of the brain is more active or it's not. In fact, what we did was actually looked at the time course of that activity and its relationship to the specific events in our experiment.  And we have some theory to go on here. Actually, as economic theory, strangely enough, that--there are a few theories out there that predict what happens while people are waiting for things. And it's quite perverse, because waiting is not really an event, it's just a state of mind.  PALCA: Right.  Dr. BERNS: And so we're specifically looking for patterns of activity that followed a particular time course; namely one that was highest when we presented the cue that said you have to wait, and then actually declined as the shock approached. So this is different than anxiety, because anxiety would be expected to grow as the shock approached in time.  But dread is something different, because you can actually see it in people when they're doing this. It's when they get shocked they actually breathe a sigh of relief. And it's the relief from the dread.  PALCA: Well, I don't know, Dr. Berns, if you felt dread by appearing on this program, but I can now tell you that I'm relieving you of the dread, because I'm afraid we've run out of time.  But thanks very much for joining us.  Dr. BERNS: My pleasure.

He was dissecting eels in order to understand their reproductive system. From there, he moved onto studying the structure and function of the human brain. Years later, he turned to psychology for answers to questions about the human mind that biology, alone, couldn't provide. It's here, of course, that Freud made his lasting mark. He believed that below the level of our conscious perception, our most primitive desires or drives, what he termed the id, are in constant conflict with our moral compass, the superego, and that both are kept in check by the ego, firmly based in reality. He believed that our dreams hold cues -- clues to the workings of our unconscious, and that many of the neuroses that plague us as adults can be traced back to a failure in childhood to resolve a basic sexual tension. Tomorrow is the 150th anniversary of Freud's birth, and in honor of that occasion, a new exhibition opens at the New York Academy of Medicine. It's a collection of Freud's scientific illustrations that span his career from med student to psychoanalyst. The exhibition is being presented by the art museum at the State University of New York in Binghamton in cooperation with the American Psychoanalytic Association and the Arnold Pfeffer Center for Neuro-Psychoanalysis at the New York Psychoanalytic Institute. We'll start the hour today with an audio tour of the exhibition, and it will be an interactive tour. So if you'd like to join us, give us a call. Our number is 800-989-8255. That's 1-800-989-TALK. And if you need visual gratification, some of the pictures we'll be talking about are on our website www. sciencefriday. com. And, now, let me introduce my guests. Lynn Gamwell is the curator of the exhibition, From Neurology to Psychoanalysis: Sigmund Freud's Drawings and Diagrams of the Mind, at the New York Academy of Medicine and the director of the art museum at the State University of New York in Binghamton. She joins me today from our NPR studios in New York. Welcome to the program. Ms. LYNN GAMWELL (Director, Art Museum at the State University of New York in Binghamton): It's wonderful to be here. PALCA: Also with us--thanks--also with is Mark Solms. He is a psychiatrist. Mark Solms is a psychoanalyst. He's the director of the Neuro-Psychoanalysis Center at the New York Psychoanalytic Institute and a professor of neuropsychology at the University of Cape Town in South Africa. He has provided commentary for the exhibition at the New York Academy of Medicine, and he joins me today at the NPR studios, also at the studios in New York. Welcome back to the program, Dr. Solms. Dr. MARK SOLMS (Director, Neuro-Psychoanalysis Center; Professor of Neuropsychology, University of Cape Town, South Africa): Thanks very much. PALCA: So, Lynn Gamwell, let's begin with you, if I may. When did Freud do these drawings? Ms. GAMWELL: Well, he began doing them as a student in the 1870s and continued them until the last decade of his life. And so he began doing them looking through a microscope as an observational tool in his training and in his early professional career as a laboratory scientist; and then he continued, once he moved from the physiology laboratory to his consultation room being a laboratory, he continued doing diagrams throughout the rest of his career. PALCA: And is there--is this a unique collection of his work that's being presented? Ms. GAMWELL: Well, what I've done is assembled all of the images that he did that were related to the mind, and they're--yes, so in the public, in the exhibition in the publication, there're--the drawings and diagrams are assembled and put in order. You walk through the exhibit. You start in the late 1870s, and you walk through Freud's career and see the--his changing images of nerves and the mind, basically. And that's what's unique, is that you're seeing all the pictures together. PALCA: If you'd like to ask questions about these pictures or, I suppose, we can even field questions about Freud's theories, we'd be happy to hear from you. Our number is 800-989-8255. That's 1-800-989-TALK, and, Mark Solms, can I turn to you and say, what was Freud drawing at the start of his career? Dr. SOLMS: At the start of his career, as you mentioned earlier, the very first paper that he ever published was a search for the missing testicles, of all things, of an eel. Nobody had ever been able to identify the male of the species, and Freud's task was to try to find those testicles, which is rather funny if you think about the fact that he later on discovered the castration complex in humans. PALCA: Right. I mean, I--yes, but I'm sure people are wondering how did people lose the eel testicles? Dr. SOLMS: It's not that they were lost. The gonads, which are the precursors of both the ovaries and the testicles, had been found, and also ovaries had been found. What hadn't been found was gonads which developed into testicles. PALCA: I see. He moved from eels to the brain. Is that right? Dr. SOLMS: Yes. He--that study on the eel was really a sort of an anomaly, because everything else from then onwards had to do, one way or another, with the nervous system. So he moved onto histological studies, that is to say studies on the structure of the nerve cell. He was trying to describe--at that time, we still didn't--had not yet discovered the neuron, and so he was trying--he and others were trying to identify what the basic units of nervous tissue was. He moved on from those histological papers to anatomical papers, where he tried to trace the pathway that was followed by individual nerve tracks in the spinal cord and then later up into the brain proper. PALCA: Maybe I could ask Lynn Gamwell now is--have you enough familiarity with the pictures of this era to say whether Freud was a particularly good draftsman or a particularly good drawer of these things? Ms. GAMWELL: He was a very good draftsman, as far as drawing through a microscope. His drawing--he was proud of them. He--and they're well drawn. They're--the detail is captured where it needs to be. They're excellent simply as drawings--as drawings through a microscope, yeah. PALCA: How long was it? I mean, was Freud overlapping at all with the early days of the photograph or was drawing the standard? Ms. GAMWELL: Well, the--yes, he was overlapping with the microscope but, I mean, with the--with photography, but both photography and the microscope he used were developed in the 1830s, the achromatic microscope, and, but throughout the 19th century, scientists that worked with microscopes continued to draw rather than photograph through a microscope, even though it was possible, because they weren't after capturing everything as far as the appearance of what they saw; they wanted to selectively direct the viewer's attention to certain details, like a cell nucleus. And so, yes, he was--he's contemporary with the development of photography. But he, himself, and his colleagues in the laboratory didn't use photographs. PALCA: Mm-hmm. Mark Solms, after his studies of the neuron, what came next? Dr. SOLMS: The studies of the neuron were of very lowly creatures, the river crayfish and also an organism called the lamprey. What came next was the human brain. So, as he moved from the study of individual neurons and from the study of the spinal cord, and moved into the brain proper, he also moved from lower animals to human beings. And the thing that interested him most initially about the human brain was trying, again, to trace the anatomical path followed by individual tracks. For example, he traced the origin of the acoustic nerve in the human brain stem. But the interesting thing about those early studies of the human brain, as far as Freud's work is concerned, were the methods that he used. He developed a method or he adopted a method that had been developed by a colleague named Flexick(ph), whereby because the brain--the pathways in the brain, as Lynn was saying earlier, it's not a matter of just photographically depicting what's there, it's very difficult to see what's there. The artist tries to identify individual structures of importance. And what Freud did was to study fetal brains, human fetuses. The purpose of doing that was it's easier in a less-developed organism to be able to identify individual's fiber pathways. And then, once he'd found the pathway in the fetus, it was then easier to re-find it in the mature adult brain. PALCA: Was there anything--I mean, if all you had to go on for predicting Freud's future were these first sets of drawings going up through the depiction of the fetal brain, was there anything in these early drawings that would predict the future course of his life and his research? Dr. SOLMS: I think that there are continuities that you can find in retrospect, which, I suppose, one could easily overstate; like for example, the method that I just mentioned was a developmental method and Freud was, in his psychological work, also a very much developmentalist, always looking for how primitive structures developed into more mature, complex structures. Also his commitment to evolutionary theory, to dynamic ways of thinking, the tendency to look for new methods, to not be satisfied with doing things the way that we were conventionally done, but rather trying to find new approaches. But all of those things I think are less important than a sort of sense of mission. Even in those early works, it was clear that Freud saw himself as somebody who had to make an important mark on science. And he tended to always go from the small, individual observation to grand theory. PALCA: And what you're saying is his observation--the detail in his small work, was noteworthy. Dr. SOLMS: The detail. . . PALCA: Well, his ability to capture smaller things that later lead to some of these bigger ideas. Dr. SOLMS: Yes. His ability to see the general in the particular. PALCA: Yeah. Dr. SOLMS: To generalize from a concrete observation to some general principle about the species. PALCA: Okay. We're talking about a new exhibit of Freud's drawings that is going on display tomorrow in New York. We'd like to hear from you. Our number's 800-989-8255, that's 800-989-TALK. And you can see some of these pictures on our web site, www. sciencefriday. com. They're quite remarkable. I encourage you to take a look. (Break) PALCA: We're talking this hour about Sigmund Freud's illustrations. My guests are Mark Solms, psychoanalyst and director of the Neuro-Psychoanalysis Center at the New York Psychoanalytic Institute and professor of neuropsychology at the University of Cape Town in South Africa. And Lynn Gamwell; she's the curator of the exhibition, From Neurology to Psychoanalysis: Sigmund Freud's Drawings and Diagrams of the Mind, at the New York Academy of Medicine and director of the Art Museum at the State University of New York at Binghamton. And Lynn Gamwell, I suppose, can you just tell us a little bit more about the exhibit, where it is and how long it will be up for, and well, how long it will be around? And does it travel? Dr. GAMWELL: It's, as you said, at the Academy of Medicine and it will be up through the summer. And then it travels to the State University of New York at Binghamton, to the museum there, in the early fall. PALCA: And the New York Academy of Medicine in New York City? Dr. GAMWELL: Mm-hmm. Yes. PALCA: Oh, all right. So what do these drawings tell us about, Lynn Gamwell--what do these drawings tell us about Freud's training and how he processed information? Hello? Dr. GAMWELL: Well, he--yes. Well, he--well he began as an observational laboratory worker. And so we see him beginning--drawing through a microscope and drawing what he saw. And then we see him--there's a clear progression as you walk through of going from things he actually saw to more abstract diagrams as his work developed. So there's--that is a pretty clear evolution that you see. And he's--you asked before about photography and there was a place where photography was used in psychiatry, which was in diagnosing patients in the 19th century. Then you wanted to see exactly what a patient looked like. And once psychoanalysis begins in the early 20th century, you don't see pictures of patients anymore. Because it--the diagnosis is by talking to the patient; it's by case study. And Freud--and so most psychoanalytic texts in the early 20th century aren't illustrated at all. But Freud continues drawing and he's diagramming them, not what he's--he's diagramming what he's imagining on the inside, or he's doing theoretical diagrams of a presumed neurological substrate in some cases, or simply his hypothesis about the organization of the psyche of the patient. PALCA: Well, we'd like to hear from you. If you have a question about these pictures, our number is 800-989-8255, that's 1-800-989-TALK. And let's take a call now from Matt(ph) in, well, Binghamton, New York, of all places. Matt, welcome to the program. MATT (Caller): Why thank you. Thank you very much. I enjoy the program every week. PALCA: Great. MATT: My question is that--how did Freud go from developing--from drawing these pictures to developing his theories. I mean, it seems like a long step of looking at the physical to looking at the--how the diseases develop throughout a lifetime, from childhood. PALCA: Yeah, interesting. Mark Solms, maybe you can shed some light on that. Dr. SOLMS: Well, that's the, I think, most interesting thing about seeing all of these drawings together in one progression, is that you're sort of forced to recognize that there's not a absolute break or even any obvious moment at which suddenly Freud is no longer doing neuroscience. I think from his point of view, he was doing exactly the same thing. It's just that he moved on to more and more complex aspects of the nervous system. So starting with an individual cell, then tracing the paths--the pathways, you know, groups of cells, what sort of pathways they form, the point of tracing those pathways is in order to understand something of the function. And if you can see how one part connects to another, it tells you something about what that part does. And that's one small step towards what he ultimately becomes interested in, which is how does this whole thing work. And how does it work at its highest levels of complexity? So you see him moving from tracing pathways in the brainstem of relatively simple functions like how sound gets from the ear into the brainstem, and then, step by step, going through more and more complex things. An important milestone along the way was trying to understand the neurological organization of our language function. Now language, of course, is a psychological thing. But Freud's approach was the approach of a neurologist and of a neuro-anatomist, what's more. He's interested in trying to identify where in the brain language is organized. And, in doing that, he was forced to recognize that these higher orders of--higher principles of organization start to govern the functioning of the apparatus. So that it's no longer simply a matter of that language is made up of auditory components, motor components, and kinesthetic components when it comes to written language and so on; but that it has principles of grammar, of syntax, of phonology, which are no longer anatomical concepts. And so he was sort of forced, in order to understand the principles that govern the apparatus at these higher levels of complexity, to start using categories, which now one is compelled to call psychological. But it's not a different type of task. He's still trying to understand how the thing works. And I think that that's the continuity right from the start through to his last psychoanalytical diagrams. PALCA: Does that make it clear, Matt? MATT: As clear as mud. (Soundbite of laughter) MATT: One more quick question. PALCA: Sure. MATT: And I'm in Binghamton. I'm wondering where is this display at? PALCA: Well, Lynn Gamwell, I think we've said it's at the New York Academy of Medicine in New York City? Dr. GAMWELL: In Binghamton. It's on the campus of SUNY, on the campus of the University, the State University of New York. PALCA: So you don't even have to come to New York City for that one, Matt. MATT: Right. PALCA: Okay, thanks very much for the call. Dr. GAMWELL: In the fall. MATT: . . . in front of the University right now. PALCA: Okay, great. Thank you for calling. I wonder, Mark Solms, if I could just ask you: How old was Freud when he began to make this turn and--this turn away from the brain and into the mind? Was that later in his--I guess how old was he? Dr. SOLMS: It depends where you want to situate that turn. Because, as I was saying a few minutes ago, and I regret to hear it was as clear as mud, but. . . PALCA: Well. . . Dr. SOLMS: There isn't one particular moment at which the turn is made. You know, he was in his early 20s when he did his first anatomical and histological drawings. That was in the late 1870s. By the late 1880s, in other words, by his early 30s, he was beginning to work on problems of language, how language is organized in the brain. And then by the late 1890s, his main interest was in the neuroses, that is to say, functional disorders of the nervous system. His first purely psychological drawing, in the sense that he makes no attempt whatsoever to identify what the brain structures are that perform the functions that he's diagramming, is 1899. So by then he's--he's in his early 40s. That gives hope to some of us to recognize that Freud's magnum opus came in his 40s already. PALCA: Right. And, you know, eventually Freud began to study what you call the meta-psychology which was even more difficult. How did that work? Dr. SOLMS: Well, the word meta-psychology was a neologism of Freud's. He invented the word trying to find a way of describing what he had to do. If he was going to have a theory about how the mind or the brain produces these complex functions that he was observing in his clinical work and limited, as he was, by having no instruments to--no scientific techniques to be able to visualize what the brain processes were that underlay them; rather than just say, well, these complex things can't be studied by science, we'd better abandon them, he used purely psychological methods of observation and tried to infer what the underlying functional principles were; what the organizing, lawful arrangement was of the nervous system to produce these psychological processes that he was observing. But because he couldn't draw the anatomy, because we didn't know what the anatomy was, he drew it in purely abstract ways, calling the systems of neurons mental systems or mental agencies. And it was this transition from neurons to abstract systems, to functional entities, that required a new word. So he no longer spoke of neuropsychology, but rather of meta-psychology, something that goes beyond what can be perceived. PALCA: Okay. Let's take another call now and go to Brian(ph) in Cincinnati. Brian, welcome to TALK OF THE NATION SCIENCE FRIDAY. BRIAN (Caller): Yeah, hi. Thanks for taking my call. PALCA: Sure. BRIAN: I've always been kind of troubled by Freud's--how he came--how he actually came upon the data that he used to develop his theories on--his psychoanalytic theories--the whole Oedipal complex has always--I've never, for example, felt--I know he said it was all subconscious that, you know, boys are attracted to their mothers, but I never understood that. It never made sense to me. I'm wondering how he actually obtained his data. Has it been questioned in the past? I suspect it's been questioned quite a bit. PALCA: Mark Solms. Dr. SOLMS: It's been questioned all along, and I think that the limitations of the methods that Freud was compelled to use is the basis for the doubt that attaches to his conclusions. It's very easy to convince people of something concrete that you can show them. You can say, look, here's the neuron. You see the cell body's connected to the fiber there; and we can all look at it and we can all agree. When you start trying to understand how the thing works and how it works, in terms of the complex interactions between millions of neurons, it's not so easy and simple to show visually what your conclusions are, and I think, likewise, your conclusions are less secure. They're more far removed from what's observable. So, how Freud arrived at his conclusions was to listen to his patients telling him what they felt, what they remembered, and what the stories of their lives were, where the symptoms arose in this fabric of a lived life. And doing so with, literally, countless patients, he eventually started to see certain organizing principles. There were certain general features that seemed to apply to all people, in the sense that he could infer underlying laws--underlying commonalities. They were--the emphasis has to fall on the word inferred--they were constructions. They were models. They were theoretical explanations for what was observable, and such things are always subject to error. But, Freud, I'm sure, didn't start out with the preconception of a thing called an Oedipus complex. It's a rather strange and counterintuitive notion. But, I assure you, that that was the best explanation that he could come up with for the clinical phenomena that he observed in his daily work over many, many years. PALCA: Brian, thanks very much for that call. Lynn Gamwell, you wanted to add something. Ms. GAMWELL: Yeah, I would add that, as Mark has described, Freud's method, that his early training in the laboratory--it shows, in that once he is observing patients, that he's always looking for the data as--gathering as much data and as--and being as objective as he can, given the elusive nature of the unobservable phenomenon that he's dealing with. But, he's always--throughout his life, he fought for--and I think that you can use a strong word like that--to insist that psychoanalysis was a science, and as based on observation as is possible, given the nature of the subject matter. PALCA: We're talking about a new exhibit of drawings by Sigmund Freud that's opening tomorrow at the New York Academy of Medicine in honor of the fact that tomorrow is the 150th anniversary of Freud's birth. I'm Joe Palca and this TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. Lynn Gamwell, let me ask you, now, do you have a favorite among these pictures in the exhibition? Ms. GAMWELL: Yes, I do. (Soundbite of laughter) PALCA: Good. Ms. GAMWELL: There's this one in the Project for a Scientific Psychology that Freud--for, I'm sure, for physiological psychological, that Freud, in the late 1890s, in which he's doing a diagram that's showing association of ideas in a dream. And, it's those. . . PALCA: Which plate--do you remember which plate number that is, because we can tell people. In the catalog--there's a link to the catalog on our website, and also, there are some of the pictures there. Do you recall which number it is? Ms. GAMWELL: No, I don't have those numbers memorized. PALCA: Oh, too bad. Okay. Ms. GAMWELL: I'm sorry. It--there's an A,B,C,D in it and it shows these four ideas and it shows the association of the ideas in the dream. And what I like about it is, you--it can have a neurological interpretation or he's thinking of the neurological substrate, but it's also linking it to a dream. And, so it's both--for me, it's also a transitional image. PALCA: Mark Solms, do you have a favorite? Dr. SOLMS: Yes, funnily enough, I have a favorite, which has the same importance that Lynn attached to the diagram of that dream in the Project for a Scientific Psychology, but it's a different drawing that I would identify as the, sort of, pivotal, transitional drawing. It's actually, from an aesthetic point of view, one of the ugliest. It was drawn in 1886, or thereabouts. We don't know precisely when it was drawn because it was never published, and, as far as I'm aware, it's being exhibited, now, for the first time. It's a drawing in which Freud shows that the relationship between the body periphery and the central organ of the brain, especially the cortex of the brain, is a very complicated relationship. One of Freud's professors, Theodore Meinert(ph), had taught that the body periphery is literally projected onto the cortex, so the cortex contains a sort of map of the body periphery. And Freud showed in that drawing that the relationship is much more complex than that--that the body periphery--the nerves going from, say, your hands or your feet, arrive at spinal nuclei where they're subtly reordered and then projected onto thalamic nuclei deep in the brain, where they're reordered again, and joined with other inputs, and then projected onto the cortex, where they're reordered again, and joined with, yet, other inputs, and then re-represented in various iterations in the cortex. And, why that's important, as Freud said in the accompanying text, is that, as we move deeper into the system--as we go from the concrete sensory motor level of the body periphery to the higher levels of the cortex, so we have different principles organizing the representation of the body. It's not a literal, physical representation of the body, but rather an increasingly abstracted depiction--performing different functions. It's not the function merely of projecting the surface, but rather of re-representing that surface in relation to other things. And I think that that drawing, in this sense, introduces what will later become the mind in Freud's theorizing--something which symbolically represents, rather than concretely represents. PALCA: Mark Solms, I'm afraid we've run out of time, but I'd like to thank my guests. Mark Solms is a psychoanalyst and director of the Neuro-Psychoanalysis Center at the New York Psychoanalytic Institute and Lynn Gamwell is the curator of this new exhibit, From Neurology to Psychoanalysis: Sigmund Freud's Drawings and Diagrams of the Mind. When we come back, a new study of the brain. Stay with us.  JOE PALCA, host:  Sigmund Freud started his scientific career not with a couch, but with a scalpel. He was dissecting eels in order to understand their reproductive system. From there, he moved onto studying the structure and function of the human brain. Years later, he turned to psychology for answers to questions about the human mind that biology, alone, couldn't provide.  It's here, of course, that Freud made his lasting mark. He believed that below the level of our conscious perception, our most primitive desires or drives, what he termed the id, are in constant conflict with our moral compass, the superego, and that both are kept in check by the ego, firmly based in reality. He believed that our dreams hold cues -- clues to the workings of our unconscious, and that many of the neuroses that plague us as adults can be traced back to a failure in childhood to resolve a basic sexual tension.  Tomorrow is the 150th anniversary of Freud's birth, and in honor of that occasion, a new exhibition opens at the New York Academy of Medicine. It's a collection of Freud's scientific illustrations that span his career from med student to psychoanalyst. The exhibition is being presented by the art museum at the State University of New York in Binghamton in cooperation with the American Psychoanalytic Association and the Arnold Pfeffer Center for Neuro-Psychoanalysis at the New York Psychoanalytic Institute.  We'll start the hour today with an audio tour of the exhibition, and it will be an interactive tour. So if you'd like to join us, give us a call. Our number is 800-989-8255. That's 1-800-989-TALK. And if you need visual gratification, some of the pictures we'll be talking about are on our website www. sciencefriday. com.  And, now, let me introduce my guests. Lynn Gamwell is the curator of the exhibition, From Neurology to Psychoanalysis: Sigmund Freud's Drawings and Diagrams of the Mind, at the New York Academy of Medicine and the director of the art museum at the State University of New York in Binghamton. She joins me today from our NPR studios in New York. Welcome to the program.  Ms. LYNN GAMWELL (Director, Art Museum at the State University of New York in Binghamton): It's wonderful to be here.  PALCA: Also with us--thanks--also with is Mark Solms. He is a psychiatrist. Mark Solms is a psychoanalyst. He's the director of the Neuro-Psychoanalysis Center at the New York Psychoanalytic Institute and a professor of neuropsychology at the University of Cape Town in South Africa. He has provided commentary for the exhibition at the New York Academy of Medicine, and he joins me today at the NPR studios, also at the studios in New York. Welcome back to the program, Dr. Solms.  Dr. MARK SOLMS (Director, Neuro-Psychoanalysis Center; Professor of Neuropsychology, University of Cape Town, South Africa): Thanks very much.  PALCA: So, Lynn Gamwell, let's begin with you, if I may. When did Freud do these drawings?  Ms. GAMWELL: Well, he began doing them as a student in the 1870s and continued them until the last decade of his life. And so he began doing them looking through a microscope as an observational tool in his training and in his early professional career as a laboratory scientist; and then he continued, once he moved from the physiology laboratory to his consultation room being a laboratory, he continued doing diagrams throughout the rest of his career.  PALCA: And is there--is this a unique collection of his work that's being presented?  Ms. GAMWELL: Well, what I've done is assembled all of the images that he did that were related to the mind, and they're--yes, so in the public, in the exhibition in the publication, there're--the drawings and diagrams are assembled and put in order. You walk through the exhibit. You start in the late 1870s, and you walk through Freud's career and see the--his changing images of nerves and the mind, basically. And that's what's unique, is that you're seeing all the pictures together.  PALCA: If you'd like to ask questions about these pictures or, I suppose, we can even field questions about Freud's theories, we'd be happy to hear from you. Our number is 800-989-8255. That's 1-800-989-TALK, and, Mark Solms, can I turn to you and say, what was Freud drawing at the start of his career?  Dr. SOLMS: At the start of his career, as you mentioned earlier, the very first paper that he ever published was a search for the missing testicles, of all things, of an eel. Nobody had ever been able to identify the male of the species, and Freud's task was to try to find those testicles, which is rather funny if you think about the fact that he later on discovered the castration complex in humans.  PALCA: Right. I mean, I--yes, but I'm sure people are wondering how did people lose the eel testicles?  Dr. SOLMS: It's not that they were lost. The gonads, which are the precursors of both the ovaries and the testicles, had been found, and also ovaries had been found. What hadn't been found was gonads which developed into testicles.  PALCA: I see. He moved from eels to the brain. Is that right?  Dr. SOLMS: Yes. He--that study on the eel was really a sort of an anomaly, because everything else from then onwards had to do, one way or another, with the nervous system. So he moved onto histological studies, that is to say studies on the structure of the nerve cell.  He was trying to describe--at that time, we still didn't--had not yet discovered the neuron, and so he was trying--he and others were trying to identify what the basic units of nervous tissue was. He moved on from those histological papers to anatomical papers, where he tried to trace the pathway that was followed by individual nerve tracks in the spinal cord and then later up into the brain proper.  PALCA: Maybe I could ask Lynn Gamwell now is--have you enough familiarity with the pictures of this era to say whether Freud was a particularly good draftsman or a particularly good drawer of these things?  Ms. GAMWELL: He was a very good draftsman, as far as drawing through a microscope. His drawing--he was proud of them. He--and they're well drawn. They're--the detail is captured where it needs to be. They're excellent simply as drawings--as drawings through a microscope, yeah.  PALCA: How long was it? I mean, was Freud overlapping at all with the early days of the photograph or was drawing the standard?  Ms. GAMWELL: Well, the--yes, he was overlapping with the microscope but, I mean, with the--with photography, but both photography and the microscope he used were developed in the 1830s, the achromatic microscope, and, but throughout the 19th century, scientists that worked with microscopes continued to draw rather than photograph through a microscope, even though it was possible, because they weren't after capturing everything as far as the appearance of what they saw; they wanted to selectively direct the viewer's attention to certain details, like a cell nucleus. And so, yes, he was--he's contemporary with the development of photography. But he, himself, and his colleagues in the laboratory didn't use photographs.  PALCA: Mm-hmm. Mark Solms, after his studies of the neuron, what came next?  Dr. SOLMS: The studies of the neuron were of very lowly creatures, the river crayfish and also an organism called the lamprey. What came next was the human brain. So, as he moved from the study of individual neurons and from the study of the spinal cord, and moved into the brain proper, he also moved from lower animals to human beings.  And the thing that interested him most initially about the human brain was trying, again, to trace the anatomical path followed by individual tracks. For example, he traced the origin of the acoustic nerve in the human brain stem.  But the interesting thing about those early studies of the human brain, as far as Freud's work is concerned, were the methods that he used. He developed a method or he adopted a method that had been developed by a colleague named Flexick(ph), whereby because the brain--the pathways in the brain, as Lynn was saying earlier, it's not a matter of just photographically depicting what's there, it's very difficult to see what's there. The artist tries to identify individual structures of importance. And what Freud did was to study fetal brains, human fetuses. The purpose of doing that was it's easier in a less-developed organism to be able to identify individual's fiber pathways. And then, once he'd found the pathway in the fetus, it was then easier to re-find it in the mature adult brain.  PALCA: Was there anything--I mean, if all you had to go on for predicting Freud's future were these first sets of drawings going up through the depiction of the fetal brain, was there anything in these early drawings that would predict the future course of his life and his research?  Dr. SOLMS: I think that there are continuities that you can find in retrospect, which, I suppose, one could easily overstate; like for example, the method that I just mentioned was a developmental method and Freud was, in his psychological work, also a very much developmentalist, always looking for how primitive structures developed into more mature, complex structures. Also his commitment to evolutionary theory, to dynamic ways of thinking, the tendency to look for new methods, to not be satisfied with doing things the way that we were conventionally done, but rather trying to find new approaches.  But all of those things I think are less important than a sort of sense of mission. Even in those early works, it was clear that Freud saw himself as somebody who had to make an important mark on science. And he tended to always go from the small, individual observation to grand theory.  PALCA: And what you're saying is his observation--the detail in his small work, was noteworthy.  Dr. SOLMS: The detail. . .  PALCA: Well, his ability to capture smaller things that later lead to some of these bigger ideas.  Dr. SOLMS: Yes. His ability to see the general in the particular.  PALCA: Yeah.  Dr. SOLMS: To generalize from a concrete observation to some general principle about the species.  PALCA: Okay. We're talking about a new exhibit of Freud's drawings that is going on display tomorrow in New York. We'd like to hear from you. Our number's 800-989-8255, that's 800-989-TALK. And you can see some of these pictures on our web site, www. sciencefriday. com. They're quite remarkable. I encourage you to take a look.  (Break)  PALCA: We're talking this hour about Sigmund Freud's illustrations. My guests are Mark Solms, psychoanalyst and director of the Neuro-Psychoanalysis Center at the New York Psychoanalytic Institute and professor of neuropsychology at the University of Cape Town in South Africa. And Lynn Gamwell; she's the curator of the exhibition, From Neurology to Psychoanalysis: Sigmund Freud's Drawings and Diagrams of the Mind, at the New York Academy of Medicine and director of the Art Museum at the State University of New York at Binghamton.  And Lynn Gamwell, I suppose, can you just tell us a little bit more about the exhibit, where it is and how long it will be up for, and well, how long it will be around? And does it travel?  Dr. GAMWELL: It's, as you said, at the Academy of Medicine and it will be up through the summer. And then it travels to the State University of New York at Binghamton, to the museum there, in the early fall.  PALCA: And the New York Academy of Medicine in New York City?  Dr. GAMWELL: Mm-hmm. Yes.  PALCA: Oh, all right. So what do these drawings tell us about, Lynn Gamwell--what do these drawings tell us about Freud's training and how he processed information? Hello?  Dr. GAMWELL: Well, he--yes. Well, he--well he began as an observational laboratory worker. And so we see him beginning--drawing through a microscope and drawing what he saw. And then we see him--there's a clear progression as you walk through of going from things he actually saw to more abstract diagrams as his work developed.  So there's--that is a pretty clear evolution that you see. And he's--you asked before about photography and there was a place where photography was used in psychiatry, which was in diagnosing patients in the 19th century. Then you wanted to see exactly what a patient looked like. And once psychoanalysis begins in the early 20th century, you don't see pictures of patients anymore. Because it--the diagnosis is by talking to the patient; it's by case study. And Freud--and so most psychoanalytic texts in the early 20th century aren't illustrated at all. But Freud continues drawing and he's diagramming them, not what he's--he's diagramming what he's imagining on the inside, or he's doing theoretical diagrams of a presumed neurological substrate in some cases, or simply his hypothesis about the organization of the psyche of the patient.  PALCA: Well, we'd like to hear from you. If you have a question about these pictures, our number is 800-989-8255, that's 1-800-989-TALK. And let's take a call now from Matt(ph) in, well, Binghamton, New York, of all places. Matt, welcome to the program.  MATT (Caller): Why thank you. Thank you very much. I enjoy the program every week.  PALCA: Great.  MATT: My question is that--how did Freud go from developing--from drawing these pictures to developing his theories. I mean, it seems like a long step of looking at the physical to looking at the--how the diseases develop throughout a lifetime, from childhood.  PALCA: Yeah, interesting. Mark Solms, maybe you can shed some light on that.  Dr. SOLMS: Well, that's the, I think, most interesting thing about seeing all of these drawings together in one progression, is that you're sort of forced to recognize that there's not a absolute break or even any obvious moment at which suddenly Freud is no longer doing neuroscience.  I think from his point of view, he was doing exactly the same thing. It's just that he moved on to more and more complex aspects of the nervous system. So starting with an individual cell, then tracing the paths--the pathways, you know, groups of cells, what sort of pathways they form, the point of tracing those pathways is in order to understand something of the function. And if you can see how one part connects to another, it tells you something about what that part does. And that's one small step towards what he ultimately becomes interested in, which is how does this whole thing work. And how does it work at its highest levels of complexity?  So you see him moving from tracing pathways in the brainstem of relatively simple functions like how sound gets from the ear into the brainstem, and then, step by step, going through more and more complex things.  An important milestone along the way was trying to understand the neurological organization of our language function. Now language, of course, is a psychological thing. But Freud's approach was the approach of a neurologist and of a neuro-anatomist, what's more. He's interested in trying to identify where in the brain language is organized. And, in doing that, he was forced to recognize that these higher orders of--higher principles of organization start to govern the functioning of the apparatus.  So that it's no longer simply a matter of that language is made up of auditory components, motor components, and kinesthetic components when it comes to written language and so on; but that it has principles of grammar, of syntax, of phonology, which are no longer anatomical concepts. And so he was sort of forced, in order to understand the principles that govern the apparatus at these higher levels of complexity, to start using categories, which now one is compelled to call psychological.  But it's not a different type of task. He's still trying to understand how the thing works. And I think that that's the continuity right from the start through to his last psychoanalytical diagrams.  PALCA: Does that make it clear, Matt?  MATT: As clear as mud.  (Soundbite of laughter)  MATT: One more quick question.  PALCA: Sure.  MATT: And I'm in Binghamton. I'm wondering where is this display at?  PALCA: Well, Lynn Gamwell, I think we've said it's at the New York Academy of Medicine in New York City?  Dr. GAMWELL: In Binghamton. It's on the campus of SUNY, on the campus of the University, the State University of New York.  PALCA: So you don't even have to come to New York City for that one, Matt.  MATT: Right.  PALCA: Okay, thanks very much for the call.  Dr. GAMWELL: In the fall.  MATT: . . . in front of the University right now.  PALCA: Okay, great. Thank you for calling.  I wonder, Mark Solms, if I could just ask you: How old was Freud when he began to make this turn and--this turn away from the brain and into the mind? Was that later in his--I guess how old was he?  Dr. SOLMS: It depends where you want to situate that turn. Because, as I was saying a few minutes ago, and I regret to hear it was as clear as mud, but. . .  PALCA: Well. . .  Dr. SOLMS: There isn't one particular moment at which the turn is made. You know, he was in his early 20s when he did his first anatomical and histological drawings. That was in the late 1870s. By the late 1880s, in other words, by his early 30s, he was beginning to work on problems of language, how language is organized in the brain. And then by the late 1890s, his main interest was in the neuroses, that is to say, functional disorders of the nervous system.  His first purely psychological drawing, in the sense that he makes no attempt whatsoever to identify what the brain structures are that perform the functions that he's diagramming, is 1899. So by then he's--he's in his early 40s. That gives hope to some of us to recognize that Freud's magnum opus came in his 40s already.  PALCA: Right. And, you know, eventually Freud began to study what you call the meta-psychology which was even more difficult. How did that work?  Dr. SOLMS: Well, the word meta-psychology was a neologism of Freud's. He invented the word trying to find a way of describing what he had to do. If he was going to have a theory about how the mind or the brain produces these complex functions that he was observing in his clinical work and limited, as he was, by having no instruments to--no scientific techniques to be able to visualize what the brain processes were that underlay them; rather than just say, well, these complex things can't be studied by science, we'd better abandon them, he used purely psychological methods of observation and tried to infer what the underlying functional principles were; what the organizing, lawful arrangement was of the nervous system to produce these psychological processes that he was observing.  But because he couldn't draw the anatomy, because we didn't know what the anatomy was, he drew it in purely abstract ways, calling the systems of neurons mental systems or mental agencies. And it was this transition from neurons to abstract systems, to functional entities, that required a new word. So he no longer spoke of neuropsychology, but rather of meta-psychology, something that goes beyond what can be perceived.  PALCA: Okay. Let's take another call now and go to Brian(ph) in Cincinnati.

I'm Joe Palca and this TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.  Lynn Gamwell, let me ask you, now, do you have a favorite among these pictures in the exhibition?  Ms. GAMWELL: Yes, I do.  (Soundbite of laughter)  PALCA: Good.  Ms. GAMWELL: There's this one in the Project for a Scientific Psychology that Freud--for, I'm sure, for physiological psychological, that Freud, in the late 1890s, in which he's doing a diagram that's showing association of ideas in a dream. And, it's those. . .  PALCA: Which plate--do you remember which plate number that is, because we can tell people.

And what I like about it is, you--it can have a neurological interpretation or he's thinking of the neurological substrate, but it's also linking it to a dream. And, so it's both--for me, it's also a transitional image.  PALCA: Mark Solms, do you have a favorite?  Dr. SOLMS: Yes, funnily enough, I have a favorite, which has the same importance that Lynn attached to the diagram of that dream in the Project for a Scientific Psychology, but it's a different drawing that I would identify as the, sort of, pivotal, transitional drawing.  It's actually, from an aesthetic point of view, one of the ugliest. It was drawn in 1886, or thereabouts. We don't know precisely when it was drawn because it was never published, and, as far as I'm aware, it's being exhibited, now, for the first time. It's a drawing in which Freud shows that the relationship between the body periphery and the central organ of the brain, especially the cortex of the brain, is a very complicated relationship.  One of Freud's professors, Theodore Meinert(ph), had taught that the body periphery is literally projected onto the cortex, so the cortex contains a sort of map of the body periphery. And Freud showed in that drawing that the relationship is much more complex than that--that the body periphery--the nerves going from, say, your hands or your feet, arrive at spinal nuclei where they're subtly reordered and then projected onto thalamic nuclei deep in the brain, where they're reordered again, and joined with other inputs, and then projected onto the cortex, where they're reordered again, and joined with, yet, other inputs, and then re-represented in various iterations in the cortex.  And, why that's important, as Freud said in the accompanying text, is that, as we move deeper into the system--as we go from the concrete sensory motor level of the body periphery to the higher levels of the cortex, so we have different principles organizing the representation of the body. It's not a literal, physical representation of the body, but rather an increasingly abstracted depiction--performing different functions. It's not the function merely of projecting the surface, but rather of re-representing that surface in relation to other things. And I think that that drawing, in this sense, introduces what will later become the mind in Freud's theorizing--something which symbolically represents, rather than concretely represents.

With summer around the corner, you may be dusting off the barbecue and getting ready to fire up the grill. But how would you feel if your next burger was from a cloned cow? The Food and Drug Administration is considering whether cloned animals and their offspring should be allowed on the market. Trans Ova Genetics is a biotech company in Iowa that is using cloning and other techniques to help farmers create a better herd of cattle. Well, is this bovine eugenics? Sort of, I guess, in a sense. Joining me now to talk about it is Dr. Dave Faber. He's the president of Trans Ova Genetics. He's on the phone from Sioux City, Iowa. Thanks for joining us today. Mr. DAVE FABER (President, Trans Ova Genetics): Thank you for having me. PALCA: You know, the first thing that comes to mind is, of what value is having a cloned animal? I mean how is that going to help consumers or farmers? Dr. FABER: Well, I guess, first of all, cloning is just another tool in the toolbox probably to help with genetic improvement of our livestock. And if we want to look at an example of how cloning may be used, first of all, it's used on a very, very small scale because it's the most expensive tool in our toolbox today. But for example, it may be used that perhaps a Holstein bull whose daughters have been identified to be excellent milk producers and perhaps resistant to or less resistant to, more resistant to something like mastitis, is identified and the bull is injured and, you know, cannot produced semen any longer, a genetic copy of him could be made. Essentially his twin could be produced so that he can go ahead and have a positive impact on the, on the dairy industry and the milk supply. PALCA: Alright. I mean I suggested and half facetiously that cloned animals would actually be made into hamburgers. Is that likely at all? Mr. FABER: Well, I think, first of all, one has to put it in perspective from a cost standpoint that, you know, today cloned animals are, in order to produce one we're looking at tens of thousands of dollars, ten to twenty thousand dollars perhaps to make such an animal. And so first of all, if there's interest in producing clones, it's certainly not to produce hamburger, but to produce animals which can be used at the kind of the top of a breeding pyramid, elite bulls that can go in for semen production, for example, would be an example as opposed to an animal used for hamburger. PALCA: I see. And FDA has been, well, forgive the pun, I guess, chewing on this issue for quite a while. Have you heard anything about their coming to some kind of conclusion? Mr. FABER: Well, basically they have asked the industry to take a step back, so that one could evaluate this. Obviously, we certainly value food safety in this country at a very high level. We have one of the highest levels of consumer confidence in our food and pharmaceuticals of anywhere in the world, and we wish to maintain that. And so basically they've wanted to be able to take time and look at, and be able to look at this because it's an issue that probably deserves consideration. PALCA: Okay. I'd like to bring my other guests back in and join this conversation. We have with us in the studio here in 3A, Michael Fernandez. He's the executive director of the Pew Initiative on Food and Biotechnology. Doug Gurian-Sherman is a senior scientist at the Center for Food Safety. And Martina Newell-McGloughlin is the director the University of California SystemWide Biotechnology Research and Education Program. And Michael Fernandez, you've tested the American public attitude toward the cloned animals as well. What kinds of things have you found? Mr. MICHAEL FERNANDEZ (Pew Initiative on Food and Biotechnology): That's right, Joe. What we found is that consumers feel very differently when it comes to animals than they do with plants. And so let me give you one example. We asked people whether they support genetically modified foods, just in general. And about 50 percent of the people actually say they oppose, 25 percent support. When we ask about animal cloning, you get about 66 percent of the people saying that they're uncomfortable with animal cloning, and 48 percent of those feel strongly about that. Consumers feel very differently when it comes to animals than they do about plants. PALCA: So Dave Faber, does that make you at all nervous to hear the public attitudes might not be embracing your technology? Mr. FABER: Well, I guess obviously one would always like to see support for technologies as one develops them. But I think one needs to put it in somewhat of a historical perspective from the standpoint that if you look back at a lot of new technologies, for those of us that are old enough to remember Baby Louise, the world's first in vitro fertilization child that was born, you know, there was large amounts of negative press, so to speak, or negative opinion. And lots of comments about, you know, the scientists are playing God, et cetera. And yet today, you know, 20 or 25 years later, there is, what, in excess of two million in vitro fertilization babies that have been born. And couples look to that technique and embrace it as one of the tools to help them with fertility. PALCA: Okay. We'd like to hear what our callers think as well. Our number is 800-989-8255. That's 800-989-TALK. And Doug Gurian-Sherman, have you got any particular concerns about cloned animals? I mean they seem to be, if you clone a healthy animal, why shouldn't the animal clone be healthy? Mr. DOUG GURIAN-SHERMAN (Center for Food Safety): Well, one big issue are ethical issues. And the other is the yuck factor, I guess, that Dr. Fernandez\u2026 PALCA: That's a scientific term. Mr. GURIAN-SHERMAN: Yes, that's a term of art, that Dr. Fernandez pointed out, people are just wary of it. And in a society where the consumer is supposed to be king, we should give them, I think, a voice in whether or not they want to purchase such foods. Both with genetically engineered crops and animals there's an issue of labeling, and if it ever goes on the market, consumers have said over and over they want labels and to be able to make that choice. The other issue, though, in terms of, you know, an ethical issue, is that the vast majority of attempts at cloning result in lack of, problems with gestation. After the animals are born, as we saw with Dolly, many of them get sick. And only a small percentage of them are healthy. So that, and while the industry has said that it's made improvements, and in some cases that may be the case, many scientists are still skeptical and a lot of data does not support that that can be done without a lot of harm to the animals themselves. PALCA: Okay. Martina Newell-McGloughlin, I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that you probably think cloned animals would be a valuable thing for the consumer. Ms. MARTINA NEWELL-MCGLOUGHLIN (SystemWide Biotechnology Research and Education Program, University of California): Yeah, but I do have concerns with it as well, for sure. I think we still have quite a bit of knowledge to gain in the area of ethi-genetics, which we're not (unintelligible). These are genetic effects that are not necessarily coded directly in the genome, but do get involved during the development phase, for example of the embryo. So whereas Dolly actually picked up a viral disease that was going around, and many of the other animals, sheep, that were with her also had to be put down, this had nothing to do with the fact that she was a clone, she was obese because she was being fed a lot by visitors. But the fact that she was put down at the age of seven, that's a pretty good age for a sheep, was due to the fact that she picked up a virus that was going around. However, as I said, I do have concerns with respect to some of the genetic imprinting and reprogramming that goes on during the development process. But I really think the big funding source or the big notion of money from cloned animals is going to be in the production of pharmaceuticals and their milk. And these animals are treated like princesses, because obviously they're worth an awful lot of money. They have their own psychologists deciding what toys they should play with so they can give lots of milk. Now, none of this is being commercialized yet. These are still going through the commercial process. But I myself have an autoimmune disease, and every so often the biotech protein that I take gets rationed because there are not enough physical plants in the world to make it. So if it could potentially be made in animals, or indeed made in plants, this would make my life a lot pleasant. Now, I know that's the selfish perspective, but of course there are a lot of other individuals out there in the same boat that I'm in. So I really think rather than just for a straight consumer, you know, production of meat and milk, this is where the big money is, the big focus for research and cloning will, I think, pay off. PALCA: Okay, let's take a call now from Adam. Adam in Fargo, North Dakota, welcome to the program. ADAM (Caller): Hello. PALCA: Hello. ADAM: I personally think that, you know, as far as with animals such as the bull mentioned earlier, that potentially can't reproduce, if there are animals that are very valuable animals, you know, be it a race horse or a purebred of an animal that is dying out in its pure form, by all means, if you can reproduce it and, you know, and quote unquote \u201cperfect the technology\u201d, then go for it. I think that it's just something where the public in general isn't well educated enough to really accept some of these new forms of technology. And my best point to cite is, look at when vaccines were first introduced. PALCA: Yeah. I mean people were afraid of them at the beginning. ADAM: Exactly. PALCA: Yeah. ADAM: I mean, unfortunately I wasn't alive back in the time period when the polio vaccine was first introduced, but I can look up and see the history of all the negative publicity that was brought against it and where people very likely were more afraid of it than today where polio is almost nonexistent. PALCA: Okay, Adam. Thanks for making that point. I wanted to ask one point that Adam brought up, Dave Faber, is how efficient, how reliable is the cloning process right now? Mr. FABER: The cloning process is not yet very efficient. Not as efficient as one would like, although it has made considerable progress. But I think if we look at a number of the technologies that we now implement today, when we first began doing embryo transfer work years ago, we were not very efficient with that technique. In vitro fertilization was not very efficient. And in fact we saw a number of the exact same scenarios with chaos produced by in vitro fertilization, and over time have continued to work and improve and now have those techniques where they're used as a day-to-day procedure. PALCA: Okay. We're talking this hour about genetically modified crops and also genetically, or at least not necessarily genetically modified, but using cloning techniques to breed animals that could be used for human consumption. I'm Joe Palca, and this is TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. And let's take another call now. How about, let's go to Brian in Kansas City, Missouri. Brian, welcome to the program. BRIAN (Caller): Hi. PALCA: Hi. BRIAN: Well here's my concern. Besides - a few reservations. I'm all for technology and I think it's great. But a few reservations about cloning as far as animal reproduction goes. I happen to know somebody in Northern Oregon who has a $4 million bull whose semen is sold. Now, that bull is about to, his production has well dropped off and he's about to go out of the market. If my friend is able to use him for his own reproduction of his own cattle, he'll be lucky over the next five years. Now, what that means is somebody else is going to be doing pretty well, because somebody else's bull now, in another part of the country, is going to start doing well. I think that's just the natural progression of things. PALCA: Yeah. BRIAN: If you, if we use the reproduction, if you use cloning for reproduction anyway, then it seems that it won't be long before a corporation is going to be the only one who's going to be able to afford a good bull. PALCA: Interesting point. Dave Faber, is cloning, is the technology you offer, going to drive up the price of cattle for the consumer? Mr. FABER: Well, hopefully, hopefully just the, just the opposite, from the standpoint that, first of all, cloning is, like we have said, cloning is simply another tool in the toolbox, and cloning in itself does not involve, you know, genetic improvement of the animal that is cloned. We're simply making a twin, or a copy, of that animal. And in the example that was given by the last caller, he's exactly correct that within another generation or two, over some time period, there will be more genetically superior animals that will be the animals that will be producing semen that will be used in America's dairy herds. PALCA: Okay. We only have a couple more minutes and I want to go through to each of you and ask a question about the future, and so why don't I start with you Doug Gurian-Sherman. Is there a future for this technology if it's properly implemented? Whether it be cloning or genetically modified organisms. Mr. GURIAN-SHERMAN: Well, I think you hit the nail on the head in part. Is it going to be properly implemented? And right now the answer is no. We've only been able to develop a few successful crops out of the hundreds of genes that have been tested. That doesn't bode well for the technology as an efficient way to go forward. Again, it's a silver bullet approach that does not look at agro- ecological principles. Organic does things better, such as soil carbon sequestration, preventing run-off, than these technologies, and ultimately is more sustainable. So I think the answer right now is no. PALCA: Okay. Martina Newell-McGloughlin, I really have to ask you to keep it brief, because we have very little time. But I'd like to hear your thoughts. Ms. NEWELL-MCGLOUGHLIN: Okay. Yeah, I think there's an awful lot of potential. Here in Davis, we're really focusing on foods for health, and using biotech you can greatly improve the nutritional quality and the functionality of food. So we can actually prevent getting diseases rather than always running to the doctor for the other components of biotech. And I think if you look at sustainability, if we right now were to switch all of the world's production to organic production, the most the earth could sustain would be about three billion people. And that's okay, but who decides where the other three billion, who are the three billion that are not kept. So I think we need to look at all the tools. PALCA: We have to leave it there. Michael Fernandez, ten seconds, can you summarize the future for us? Mr. FERNANDEZ: I think that, you know, biotech is definitely here to stay. And the question is will we get those kinds of consumer trades, and will we have a regulatory system that's ready to deal with them? PALCA: Okay. Well, I'm afraid we're going to have to leave it there. I'd like to thank my guests this hour. Michael Fernandez is the Executive Director of the Pew Initiative on Food and Biotechnology. Doug Gurian-Sherman is a senior scientist at the Center for Food Safety.

I'm Ed Gordon. Two recent national studies on alcohol consumption are making headlines. One report sheds light on potential ground breaking treatment for addiction. The other suggests young people who listen to rap are more likely to abuse alcohol. (Soundbite of music) BUSTA RHYMES: (Rapping) What you gonna say?  Tell that brother, pass the Courvoisier. You're going to tell that brother, pass the Courvoisier. Everybody singing now, pass the Courvoisier. GORDON: A recent study concludes that popular songs like Pass the Courvoisier by rap artist Busta Rhymes are strongly linked to alcohol addiction, drug use, and violence among young people. The report comes from the Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluations Prevention Research Center in Berkley, California. It was released days after the rapper Proof was gunned down in a Detroit nightclub last month, reportedly after shooting to death another man. Proof's blood alcohol level was said to be four times the legal limit. There's no question rap music is a powerful influence. Marketers have shown a correlation to the release of these tunes and increased sales of alcohol beverages mentioned in these songs. Researchers maintain alcohol marketing, particularly targeted to young black people, has become even more prominent. Earlier I discussed these issues with David Jernigan of Georgetown University and Denise Herd of the University of California, Berkeley. Mr. DAVID JERNIGAN, (Executive Director, Center on Alcohol Marketing and Youth, Georgetown University): Well, it's an interesting picture for African American youth in that they consistently drink less than youth in general. And yet our studies of their exposure to alcohol advertising have shown, over and over, again, that they're getting exposed to considerably more than youth in general. In fact, when we looked at magazines in 2002, we found that African Americans youth ages 12 to 20 were exposed to 66 percent more advertising for beer and ale, and 81 percent more advertising for distilled spirits. And the heaviest overexposure that they get is for the cognacs and the brandies, which have been very tied in with the hip hop and rap culture. GORDON: Denise Herd, let me bring you in. We'll be talking about rap and hip hop and your extensive study of all of that. But before I get to that if we take the numbers that David Jernigan just gave us, I can hear the conspiracy theorists talk about idea of black youth drinking less but being targeted more. As you've looked at this, what does your findings saying? Ms. DENISE HERD (Associate Professor, University California School of Public Health): Some recent studies have begun to show that some segments of that youth group may be starting to drink more. And I would look to alcohol advertising as one of the factors that may be influencing the change in trend. GORDON: Now, I know you've done extensive study in terms of hip hop music and the tie to alcohol related references within the music and whether or not that bolsters the idea of young people drinking. We can get go chapter and verse with songs about that or ties in the marketing between a rapper and particular ale or distilled drink. But talk to me about what you're findings showed in terms of the strange marriage between hip hop, alcohol, and today's youth? Ms. HERD: Well, I think what this song shows that there's been a very strong increase in the amount of alcohol in hip hop music. And if you talk about a chicken and egg argument, early hip hop did not have much alcohol in it. Early rap music was not an alcohol-soaked music. Early rap music practically had no alcohol references. The music wasn't exhibiting alcohol in it from the inception. Rather, over time, the number of alcohol references has grown tremendously. And I think we have to look at the role of rappers and as in advertising malt liquors, and look a role of the exposure, as David mentioned. The rapper's a very powerful role model. They are also people that were trying to get a head and trying to get underwriting for their music, and alcohol advertisers provided some of that--some of those resources. So that almost every major rapper had some kind of a relationship with an alcohol company. GORDON: David Jernigan, we saw the idea some years ago of looking at attempting to deglamourize, if you will, smoking with Hollywood and those efforts,  and it really gave a hit to the tobacco industry. We are not seeing that with alcohol on the other end today. It is being not only glamorized, but it is quite often the personification of cool for many young people. Mr. JERNIGAN: In fact, we have an absolutely tiny public service announcement to campaign on alcohol and young people's drinking happening funded by the federal government at the level about $800,000 a year. Compare that to more than a $100 million a years that we're spending on illegal drugs, and roughly that amount that amount we're spending on tobacco. So you're right, there's very little out there to counter this glamorization. And we just find, over and over, again, that kids--and African American kids, in particular--are exposed to a lot of that glamorization. Denise Herd talked about the rap music, and you know, one of the main vehicles for that is radio. When we looked at African American youth's exposure to alcohol ads on radio compared to youth in general, African American youth are hearing 56 percent more ads for distilled spirits on the radio than youth in general. And when we compared youth in general to adult exposure on the radio, youth are overexposed. That is youth in general hear more of this kind of advertising\u2014 under-aged youth, hear more of this kind of advertising--than adults. So you have African American youth hearing even more than adults. GORDON: How do you justify to a young person that this is something that they need to look at when they look across the table and see the older generation stumbling the same way? Ms. HERD: I think the youth are right, it is a societal problem, and that in part, hip hop in reflecting society is picking up on norms across the country. And I think that when we look at hip hop and that relationship to black youth--I mean, my concern is that African American youth are more vulnerable, due to social status; due to not having the political opportunities in expression; the educational opportunities. So this is a more vulnerable population. And I also think that, in contrast to the way the people often think about it, this community has had strengths in protecting their youth from over indulgence in alcoholic beverages. So that protective factor, I believe, is being torn away by the increasing targeting of the community in the advertising and so forth. GORDON: The idea though, that as we see a continuing growth of violence if young people across the board--not just African American youth, but youth in America--the mix of violence and alcoholism is deadly, as we know. How do you get America to look at this and say, if nothing else, if you see drinking as a non-issue because we kind of wink and nod at alcoholism in this country, how do we convince them that violence and alcoholism is a toxic mix for youth? Mr. JERNIGAN: Partly, we have an educational mission that we basically abandoned around alcohol, that we are not getting the word out about what we know about what the consequences of alcohol are going to be. And it's particularly important with young people, that we have, again, more and more research that shows that the younger a person starts to drink, the greater the consequences. Young people who start drinking before the age of 15 are four times more likely to become alcohol dependent than those who wait until they're 21; seven times more likely to be in an alcohol rated motor vehicle; 11 times more likely to suffer from violence, to be involved in a fight after drinking. So we want to delay kids drinking as long as possible. That's sort of the health and safety issue here. And then when we talk about African American young people, I think Denise Herd is right, what we find is that although African Americans drink less, they suffer the consequences more. GORDON: All right. I think you both. Mr. JERNIGAN: Thank you. Ms. HERD: Thank you very much.  ED GORDON, host:  From NPR News, this is NEWS AND NOTES. I'm Ed Gordon.

Scientists have some new information about one of our ancestors. Consider this a bit of Darwinian genealogy. It's the story of an ape-like creature that existed long ago. Eventually it split into two new species. One branch would lead to chimpanzees, and another would lead to us. Evolutionary theory holds that such a split ultimately separates the two new species. They do not normally reproduce with each other. But scientists studying DNA say that common ancestors of humans and chimps may have spent millions of years hovering between the two lines, mating and swapping genes. NPR's Christopher Joyce reports. CHRISTOPHER JOYCE reporting: Some scientists who study chimp and human evolution use the term chuman to refer to this common ancestor, which lived at least five million years ago. But let's make it clear that this new research does not suggest that early chimps were mating with pre-humans. These were two new species, just beginning to emerge from an ape-like common ancestor. As Harvard University's David Reich points out, it would be millions of years before the two lines evolved into what we know now as chimp and human. Professor DAVID REICH (Harvard University): These species were much more similar to the ancestral populations than they were to either us or to chimpanzees today. So thinking about it in terms of a mixture between modern humans and modern chimpanzees is a completely inappropriate way to think about it. JOYCE: But during the process of splitting, members of the two new species, well, it seems they wavered. The two populations kept crossing back. Prof. REICH: That's right. And that leaves an impact on the pattern of genetic variation that we see when we compare the human and chimpanzee genomes. JOYCE: Reich is a geneticist, not a fossil hunter. He and colleagues at Harvard and MIT looked at all the genes in chimps and humans, their genomes. The difference between the two is only about three or four percent. But you can tell a lot from the pattern of those differences. Prof. REICH: Instead of a kind of homogeneous pattern across the genome, which would be expected, you see a very unusual pattern with some sections very much more recently diverged, and very much less different from each other than in other sections where they're much more diverged. And we're using that to really learn about the history at this time, five or six million years ago. JOYCE: When the protochimp line split from the protohuman line, the genes of each new line slowly accumulated changes. They diverged. Think of how the Model T has slowly diverged into Mustangs and Tauruses and Pintos. The longer it's been since the split, the more differences you'll see in the two genomes. Writing in the journal Nature, Reich says it's the patterns he sees in regions of the human and chimp genomes that suggests this persistent hybridizing. Some genes indicate a very old split, others a much more recent divergence. In fact, it apparently took at least four million years for the species that would be man and the one that would be chimp to finally break it off and go their own ways. Scientists who study evolution say this hypothesis makes sense. It takes a long time to make a new species. But it took the sequencing of human and chimp genomes to see the evidence, and it may take similar studies of other closely related species to prove it. INSKEEP: Christopher Joyce, NPR News.

The colt shattered his right hind leg in Saturday's Preakness. Barbaro's surgeon, Dean Richardson, says he's now encouraged. Dr. DEAN RICHARDSON (Veterinary Surgeon): He's got absolutely normal vital signs. He actually was scratching his left ear with his left hind leg, which is his good leg. INSKEEP: For those of us who are not horse people, that is a good sign. Because it means that Barbaro was comfortable putting weight on his bad leg in order to lift the good one. Not too long ago, vets would not even have tried to save Barbaro. NPR's Julie Rovner, who is a horse person, traveled to his hospital yesterday to find out what has changed. JULIE ROVNER reporting: Barbaro is recuperating in the intensive care unit at the University of Pennsylvania's New Bolton Center. The hospital has set up an e-mail address for people to send Barbaro messages. That surprised Dr. Dean Richardson. Dr. RICHARDSON: I'm a little upset. This is the first I heard about the e-mail, because, we actually don't have a keyboard in his stall, yet. ROVNER: But that's about the only place at New Bolton where you won't find the very latest in high-tech medical equipment. Other than animal footsteps, and wards with stalls instead of beds, New Bolton looks like many human hospitals. There's a neo-natal unit, a sports medicine facility, even a giant treadmill. In radiology, where patients include horses, sheep, goats, antelope, even an occasional elephant, Dr. Lexi(ph) McKnight runs the giant MRI machine. Dr. ALEXIA MCKNIGHT (Assistant Professor of Radiology, New Bolton Center, University of Pennsylvania): It's similar to an Oreo cookie without the cream in the middle. And in between there's a space to position a portion of the body such as their head or their ankle or their foot, where we can acquire images about the anatomy. ROVNER: On the other side of a padded wall, a horse and a goat are undergoing routine surgery in the same room. Vets here have advanced farthest, though, in caring for horses with critical injuries like Barbaro's. Ms. JOAN HENDRICKS (Dean, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of Pennsylvania): You know, everybody's focused on the injury, but the entire other 999 pounds of the horse, besides that one bone, the level of care that we've learned to do here with the intensive care unit, it's 24/7 and it has been for ten or 15 years now. ROVNER: Joan Hendricks is the Dean of the University's School of Veterinary Medicine. She says a broken leg has long been a life-threatening event for a horse, because you can't just put them on bed rest. Ms. HENDRICKS: If a horse doesn't bear weight evenly on all four legs, the legs that are not injured suffer terrible inflammation and changes in blood flow. And that, in itself, can be, you can't sustain the horse. ROVNER: And the most dangerous time is not the surgery, but what happens when you wake the horse up. Ms. HENDRICKS: Anybody waking up from anesthesia is confused and kind of thrashes around. I mean, that's not just horses. But here we have a young, large animal and, in some cases, particularly anxious. ROVNER: That thrashing around, in fact, is what led to the death of the Champion filly Ruffian, who broke down at Belmont Park in 1975. So New Bolton has pioneered the wake up pool. Anesthetized horses are lowered into a rubber raft that fits over the animals legs like a giant horse glove, then lowered into a pool. New Bolton's development director Jane Simone describes how it works. Ms. JANE SIMONE (Development Director, New Bolton Center): At one end of this raft is an inflatable area that, once the animal is in the water, we inflate that, and the recovery team sits around the animals head to make sure that as it awakes it is kept calm. ROVNER: But it's a very labor-intensive process. Ms. SIMONE: There's a huge crew on hand to recover an animal in a pool. About a dozen were here for Barbaro, and always a technician at the head of the animal, and Dr. Richardson frequently coming in to check on him. ROVNER: And all that care does not come cheap. Barbaro's bills will certainly run into the tens of thousands of dollars. Vet school dean, Joan Hendricks, says veterinary medicine is facing the same dilemma as medicine for humans: there's a growing gap between what doctors can do and what people can afford. Ms. HENDRICKS: As we become more capable of doing extraordinary things that sometimes work, and that everybody really wants - everybody loves their animal or, you know, family member - and wants the absolute ultimate to be done. How does society afford that for any living creature? ROVNER: Money is not the issue for Barbaro's owners, who are major donors to New Bolton. Gretchen Jackson, who owns the horse with her husband, says they would have done the same even if Barbaro didn't have a potential future as a breeding stallion. Ms. GRETCHEN JACKSON (Owner of Barbaro): I hope there's some knowledge now, that owners, and trainers, and jockeys care. It's not about money. It's more about the horse. And what's better than love? I don't know. ROVNER: Julie Rovner, NPR News.  STEVE INSKEEP, host:  The winner of the Kentucky Derby, Barbaro, continues to improve after weekend surgery.

In radiology, where patients include horses, sheep, goats, antelope, even an occasional elephant, Dr. Lexi(ph) McKnight runs the giant MRI machine.  Dr. ALEXIA MCKNIGHT (Assistant Professor of Radiology, New Bolton Center, University of Pennsylvania): It's similar to an Oreo cookie without the cream in the middle. And in between there's a space to position a portion of the body such as their head or their ankle or their foot, where we can acquire images about the anatomy.  ROVNER: On the other side of a padded wall, a horse and a goat are undergoing routine surgery in the same room. Vets here have advanced farthest, though, in caring for horses with critical injuries like Barbaro's.  Ms. JOAN HENDRICKS (Dean, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of Pennsylvania): You know, everybody's focused on the injury, but the entire other 999 pounds of the horse, besides that one bone, the level of care that we've learned to do here with the intensive care unit, it's 24/7 and it has been for ten or 15 years now.  ROVNER: Joan Hendricks is the Dean of the University's School of Veterinary Medicine. She says a broken leg has long been a life-threatening event for a horse, because you can't just put them on bed rest.  Ms. HENDRICKS: If a horse doesn't bear weight evenly on all four legs, the legs that are not injured suffer terrible inflammation and changes in blood flow. And that, in itself, can be, you can't sustain the horse.  ROVNER: And the most dangerous time is not the surgery, but what happens when you wake the horse up.  Ms. HENDRICKS: Anybody waking up from anesthesia is confused and kind of thrashes around. I mean, that's not just horses. But here we have a young, large animal and, in some cases, particularly anxious.  ROVNER: That thrashing around, in fact, is what led to the death of the Champion filly Ruffian, who broke down at Belmont Park in 1975. So New Bolton has pioneered the wake up pool. Anesthetized horses are lowered into a rubber raft that fits over the animals legs like a giant horse glove, then lowered into a pool.  New Bolton's development director Jane Simone describes how it works.  Ms. JANE SIMONE (Development Director, New Bolton Center): At one end of this raft is an inflatable area that, once the animal is in the water, we inflate that, and the recovery team sits around the animals head to make sure that as it awakes it is kept calm.  ROVNER: But it's a very labor-intensive process.  Ms. SIMONE: There's a huge crew on hand to recover an animal in a pool. About a dozen were here for Barbaro, and always a technician at the head of the animal, and Dr. Richardson frequently coming in to check on him.  ROVNER: And all that care does not come cheap. Barbaro's bills will certainly run into the tens of thousands of dollars.  Vet school dean, Joan Hendricks, says veterinary medicine is facing the same dilemma as medicine for humans: there's a growing gap between what doctors can do and what people can afford.  Ms. HENDRICKS: As we become more capable of doing extraordinary things that sometimes work, and that everybody really wants - everybody loves their animal or, you know, family member - and wants the absolute ultimate to be done. How does society afford that for any living creature?  ROVNER: Money is not the issue for Barbaro's owners, who are major donors to New Bolton.  Gretchen Jackson, who owns the horse with her husband, says they would have done the same even if Barbaro didn't have a potential future as a breeding stallion.  Ms. GRETCHEN JACKSON (Owner of Barbaro): I hope there's some knowledge now, that owners, and trainers, and jockeys care. It's not about money. It's more about the horse. And what's better than love? I don't know.  ROVNER: Julie Rovner, NPR News. ", "section": "Science", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2006 NPR.  All rights reserved.

I'm Ed Gordon. Hurricane season starts tomorrow. The National Hurricane Center says the Gulf Coast region should gear up for yet another very active hurricane season. U. S. disaster preparedness officials say they're ready, but residents of storm battered coastal areas are anxious after experiencing the destruction caused by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita last year. Joining me now to discuss the ongoing recovery from last year's hurricanes and what's ahead for this year are Dom Hammack, staff writer of the Biloxi Sun-Herald and William Gray, leader of the Colorado State University Hurricane Forecast Team. Gentlemen, welcome. Mr. DOM HAMMACK (Staff Writer, Biloxi Sun-Herald): Thank you. Dr. WILLIAM GRAY (Leader, Colorado State University Hurricane Forecast Team): Glad to join you. GORDON: Mr. Gray, let me start with you. So many people - So many people trying to figure out whether or not we're going to see another year like last year as forecasters try to prognosticate. What are we looking for this year? Dr. GRAY: Well, we're looking for a pretty active season. Not as active as last year, but we've had this spate of very active seasons since 1995, and we think this will be another active season; but that doesn't necessarily mean we'll have the damage we've had the last couple years. GORDON: Mr. Gray, so many people concerned about the levees and whether these areas are ready. The Army Corps of Engineers suggests that they're moving along as quickly as possible. But as forecasters will do, as you try to pinpoint how these storms go, are you comfortable with what you've been hearing from the Army Corps of Engineers and others, in relation to being ready for this season? Dr. GRAY: Well, I haven't - I haven't been following that topic so much that I could talk very intelligently about it. I do know that, you know, had the New Orleans levees not been breached last year that the overall damage from Katrina probably would have been only half as much as it was. I can't talk to that question, but the probability of a storm coming into New Orleans again this year is very low. See, anywhere along the coast, in any one year, the probability of being hit is extremely low. GORDON: Dom Hammack, let me turn my attention to you. I am sure residents are glad to hear that and hope Mr. Gray is correct. Talk to me about what you have seen and heard when talking to residents. Mr. HAMMACK: Well, I think, you know, this is one year where the folks at the Hurricane Center and all the emergency management agencies aren't going to have a lot of trouble getting people to evacuate. This is certainly a year where people are on edge. I don't think anybody's looking forward to tomorrow and the start of hurricane season, even though we know there's not going to be a storm, you know, tomorrow. It's just kind of the specter of it that's hanging over us. And I think, intellectually, most people realize that the odds of getting hit by a storm like Dr. Gray said are very small each year; but when you've clobbered by what we've gotten clobbered by here, nine months ago or so, it's a daunting - it's just kind of a feeling of dread, really, that's around here. And, like I said, I think anytime you get storms that kind of touch into the Gulf, it's going to - there's going to be a lot of people whose cars are pointed north at that point. GORDON: Yeah, Mr. Hammack, what about the psychological aspect of all that still has to be done a year later when we talk about clean up, when we talk about people not even back in their homes or anything that remotely resembles a home environment for them? Mr. HAMMACK: Well, I mean, you know, you've got, I think we're down - we've got 90 percent or more of the debris removed in everyplace along the Mississippi coast; which is good but it's still, there's places over in Hancock county around Bay St. Louis and Waveland and all that still have, you know, 10 percent of the debris left to be removed from a storm that happened nine months ago. There's a lot of people who are - something like 38,000 families in Mississippi who are living in FEMA trailers. And that's nothing to be excited about, and certainly not with storm season coming up. I think everybody realizes how vulnerable they can be to storms. They're really like living in oversized sardine cans. They're not very comfortable. They're meant for kind of weekend getaways, not for long-term living. And there's anxiousness with that. There's people who are putting off rebuilding just because they're kind of nervous in trying to figure out what's going to go on with the future storms, with the FEMA flood elevations, which are such a hot topic around here. And things like that. So, I mean, there's really, you know - you get kind of battered by it a lot of times if you've lost your house. You've got so many decisions to make and it all kind of makes for an uneasy, you know, psychological makeup. GORDON: Mr. Gray, let me go back to you and talk to you about storm patterns and whether or not we see the kind of season we saw last year. There are those who are concerned that over the years, whether it be this year, next year, or the following, we're starting to see patterns, conditions of change, atmospheric conditions of change that will certainly bring stronger storms; is that something that you have seen throughout? Dr. GRAY: Yeah, I can speak to that, yes. We - in the Atlantic, we have this multi-decadal pattern where you have, oh, 20-30 years or so of more major storms. It mainly occurs with the most intense, not the weaker storms. And like the 1940s, '50s, early '60s was this active period. And then we went through from the late '60s to the middle '90s through this period where we had a lot fewer major storms and many fewer land falling storms. Then the pattern changed again in 1995; in the last 11 years, all but two have been very active. Now, we were very lucky in the early phases of this active period. From 1995 through 2003, we had 32 Atlantic basin major storms and only three hit the U. S. Now, the long-term average is about one in three, or one in three-and-a-half. So we were extremely lucky. Now, we've been saying that, for a number of years that we're going to start to see hurricane damage like we've never previously seen it. Not that we will necessarily get more land falling storms than we did in the '40s through the early '60s, but there's been such a build up of people and property values along the southeast coast that if we return to anything similar to that earlier pattern, we're going to see a lot of hurricane spawned damage. GORDON: Dom Hammack, what are you finding - as you are reporting your stories and going out and talking to people - seems to be the biggest concern? If they're not concerned about the big storm coming this year, what are they most concerned about? Mr. HAMMACK: Well, I think, you know, the biggest concern around here tends to be things in the rebuilding process. We've got a lot of issues with that and everything from the FEMA flood elevations, which I mentioned which would set the baselines for the National Flood Insurance Program and things like that. And people are really concerned that they're going to have to build up far too high, to make it too expensive. Insurance is going to be a massive problem around these parts. Like Dr. Gray mentioned, there's been such a build up, you know, in the past decades - and especially around here, since the introduction of gambling here in the early 90s - that, you know, the insurance companies have a lot to be concerned about. And it's going to be significantly more expensive to get insurance. And so those are kind of the issues that we're looking at. We've got a lot of, kind of, big development going on, but there's a lot of concern about where is affordable housing going to be? Where are all the people who work in the service industry - at casinos and restaurants and retail - where are they going to live at? Because land prices have really, kind of, soared through the roof. So we're - you know, there are a lot of people that are trying to help the area kind of make, you know, smart - excuse me - smart development decisions. But it's one of those things where, you know, in a lot of cases, the almighty dollar wins out. And we're kind of pointed towards bigger and better and that kind of thing. GORDON: What of the idea of resiliency? We always talk about people coming through these kinds of tragedies, these catastrophes, and being resilient and moving on. Yet, there is a reality that says that, to some degree, just being human in a situation like that, there are times that you're crestfallen. When you see the hurricane season upon us, imminent, are you finding that people are a bit more pessimistic than optimistic, Don? Mr. HAMMACK: Well, you know - and I think I've - you know, I don't want to paint a picture that's kind of different from around here. I think, you know, one of the things that's so frustrating about all these issues is that so many people do want to stay here and do want to be here. And we know that hurricanes are a part of our lives around here. I mean, they always have been. And everybody who's originally from here kind of grows up with it and knows that that's kind of the way of life. We certainly never expected anything like Katrina - something of that magnitude. But, you know, we had Camille here before, and the area rebuilt. And I think there is a determination to come back. There's a lot of great things about the area, and I think there is a determination. And that was evident from the early days after the storm, and it's still there now. There's frustration, to be sure; and there will be frustration around here for many years while people try and get rebuilt. But I don't think we've seen any kind of massive hang your head and feel sorry for me kind of thing. Everybody's kind of trying to point towards the future and get their lives back on track. GORDON: Well, certainly, we hope that Dr. Gray's predictions are true and that we don't see the kind of massive destruction and landfall power from a hurricane that we saw last year. Don Hammack is a Staff Writer at the Biloxi Sun-Herald in southern Mississippi. And William Gray has led the Colorado State University Hurricane Forecast Team for the last 22 years. Gentlemen, I thank you both. Greatly appreciate it. Mr. HAMMACK: Thank you. Dr. GRAY: Thank you. (Soundbite of music) GORDON: Coming up, another ethics scandal may be brewing in Washington. And no diploma? No problem. Some colleges are now accepting students without high school degrees. We'll discuss these topics and more on our Roundtable.

Sander Van Weingarten(ph) has helped develop a sound system to confuse and disrupt chanting crowds. He works at the Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research. And he's presenting a paper this week at a meeting of the Acoustical Society of America in Providence, Rhode Island. And he joins me now.  Dr. Van Weingarten you actually started working on this technique after soccer hooligans chanted abuse at rival teams in the Netherlands? Mr. SANDER VAN WEINGARTEN (Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research): Yes, more or less. Offensive chanting has been going on for a number of years, but a couple of years ago it was a bit worse than usual. BERKES: So how will your technique get them to shut up? Mr. VAN WEINGARTEN: Well, the basic principal is very simple. If you hear echoes or delayed sounds it's usually confusing. And our approach is basically that we record sounds from chanting, from the stands in the stadium, for instance, and we feed it back into the crowd at a certain delay. BERKES: And the reaction is the chanting stops? Mr. VAN WEINGARTEN: Well, that's the idea, at least, and it remains to be seen how well that will work in a real-life situation in the stadium. BERKES: How long is the delay for it to work? Mr. VAN WEINGARTEN: It has to be at least 200 milliseconds, but any delay time of maybe say around half a second will work. BERKES: Can we try it right now? I'd like you to read something you have in front of you and let's try it. Mr. VAN WEINGARTEN: Okay. I have a book here, so. . . BERKES: I have a book here, so. . . Mr. VAN WEINGARTEN: The typewritten. . . BERKES: The typewritten. . . Mr. VAN WEINGARTEN: . . . fields seems like just. . . BERKES: . . . fields seems like just. . . Mr. VAN WEINGARTEN: . . . a big joke. BERKES: . . . a big joke. Mr. VAN WEINGARTEN: It's a bit different, this. BERKES: You did seem confused, though. Mr. VAN WEINGARTEN: Now, the difference is that there is no particular timing to this. Let's say that you're standing in a crowd and you're trying to chant together but the person standing left to you chooses a slightly faster rhythm than you are choosing. And the person right of you is on another beat altogether. It becomes very difficult to chant synchronously together with your neighbors in the crowd. So what we are doing is we're using loudspeakers to simulate out of sync chanters, people who have no sense of rhythm. BERKES: Is it possible though that stopping soccer fans from chanting might cause them to get into trouble, or cause trouble in other ways? Mr. VAN WEINGARTEN: Yes. That's a real concern. You need to be sure that if you frustrate people by disrupting their chanting, that they are not tempted to express themselves in other ways, perhaps even more violent ways. So this is never something that can be done alone. It always has to be done along with other measures.  One thing that we've been thinking of is that what you can try to do is while you suppress an offensive chant you try to artificially start one that's not as offensive but it's also quite catchy. So you're sort of implanting a nice chant in the crowd while you're disrupting the offensive ones. BERKES: Doctor Sander Van Weingarten of the Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research. Thank you. Mr. VAN WEINGARTEN: You're welcome. BERKES: We go now from thundering crowds to tiptoeing thieves. James Sabatier and his colleagues at the University of Mississippi are working on ways to detect someone sneaking around in your house. He'll also be at the Acoustical Society meeting this week. But first we thought we'd ask him about his research. Doctor Sabatier looked at different kinds of footsteps, normal and stealthy. Dr. JAMES SABATIER (University of Mississippi): As you take a step your heel touches the floor first. And the first thing that happens is, the floor supports your weight. So that then impulsive force sends a signal that propagates through the floor, a vibration signal that propagates through the floor to our receiver. And that signal is low frequency. When the toe comes down, about 100 milliseconds, 150 milliseconds later, it slaps the floor and it stops. It's like slamming on the brakes in your car. And so when that foot slides ever so slightly, it creates another kind of signal, high frequency broadband noise. But mostly it's in the ultrasound. BERKES: And there's a dramatic difference then in the friction noise between a normal step, a stealthy step and a soft step? Dr. SABATIER: For us the stealthy step was to walk on tiptoes. When you do that, you don't make the sort of low frequency signal, but the ultrasound or the friction signal is still there. BERKES: Would it be possible then to perhaps program a home alarm system of some sort that could recognize stealthy steps and warn people that someone's walking around the house stealthily? Dr. SABATIER: We think this is probably one of the most important things that's come out of this work. One of the problems with home alarm systems is there are too many false alarms. They cannot distinguish a person. So if you can indeed look for this high frequency signal associated with footsteps, you can identify a person. But I don't think that a burglar is going to tippy-toe around your house. A burglar is going to walk normal. So the important thing about finding people is to look for the low frequency signal followed by, 150 milliseconds later, this ultrasound, or high frequency signal. And so that combination of those two I think is unique to the footstep of a person. BERKES: I have to say I'm a little bit disappointed because I was hoping that his would help me catch my teenage daughter sneaking into the house after curfew. Dr. SABATIER: Well, it might help with that too. You might be able to do that as well. BERKES: James Sabatier of the University of Mississippi. Thank you. Dr. SABATIER: You bet. BERKES: Finally, let's take a trip back in time. Dr. Phil Lieberman of Brown University will be presenting a paper at the Acoustical Society Conference on the language of Neanderthals. Neanderthals and other early hominids had very short necks. Not a lot of room for windpipes and a voice box. While some researchers now believe they could speak, no one's quite sure what they might have sounded like. Dr. Lieberman joins us now. Hello. Dr. PHIL LIEBERMAN (Brown University): Hi there. BERKES: How do we know that Neanderthals spoke? Dr. LIEBERMAN: Well, if - the point is, the changes that occurred later in the sort of the human line are such that we have a very weird tongue. Our tongue is moved down into our neck. And this makes it possible to produce a few extra sounds. But the risk for producing these extra sounds, which are very highly useful for improving the quality of speech, makes us susceptible to choking to death on food. And there would have been absolutely no reason for these mutations to be retained, in other words, the tongue moving, migrating down into the neck, unless speech was already there. BERKES: So we know based on the way that we're constructed now that those who proceeded us must have spoke. Dr. LIEBERMAN: Yes. Speech I think has very ancient roots and it's - I think it's tied up to a general increase in motor control and cognitive ability in humans. It's sort of a big package. And if you see from the archaeological record of virtually all archaic hominids about going back to a hundred thousand years ago, that their tools are quite complex, their hunting patterns are quite complex, and there's no way you can conceive of that going on without language and speech. BERKES: And what do you think then these ancient peoples might have sounded like with those short necks. Dr. LIEBERMAN: Well, you can produce virtually all the sounds of speech with that kind of vocal track. In other words, the airway formed by the tongue and the mouth, the stuff above your larynx or voicebox, and they would have sounded - if I were to say, I'll see you, they wouldn't have been able to say the vowels E or OO, they would come out Oh-feh-ya(ph), something like that. It's not even a question of sounding funny, it's just a question of not being as clear in your speech and a higher confusion rate. BERKES: Dr. Phil Lieberman. Thanks for joining us. Dr. LIEBERMAN: Yeah, I'm pleased to have been able to talk to you. (Soundbite of music) BERKES: And since I can produce the sound Ee(ph), I'll say that next week Debbie Elliott will return.  HOWARD BERKES, host:  The politicians may be stymied but science may have a solution to racist chants, if not fist fights at soccer matches. Sander Van Weingarten(ph) has helped develop a sound system to confuse and disrupt chanting crowds. He works at the Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research. And he's presenting a paper this week at a meeting of the Acoustical Society of America in Providence, Rhode Island. And he joins me now.   Dr. Van Weingarten you actually started working on this technique after soccer hooligans chanted abuse at rival teams in the Netherlands?  Mr. SANDER VAN WEINGARTEN (Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research): Yes, more or less. Offensive chanting has been going on for a number of years, but a couple of years ago it was a bit worse than usual.  BERKES: So how will your technique get them to shut up?  Mr. VAN WEINGARTEN: Well, the basic principal is very simple. If you hear echoes or delayed sounds it's usually confusing. And our approach is basically that we record sounds from chanting, from the stands in the stadium, for instance, and we feed it back into the crowd at a certain delay.  BERKES: And the reaction is the chanting stops?  Mr. VAN WEINGARTEN: Well, that's the idea, at least, and it remains to be seen how well that will work in a real-life situation in the stadium.  BERKES: How long is the delay for it to work?  Mr. VAN WEINGARTEN: It has to be at least 200 milliseconds, but any delay time of maybe say around half a second will work.  BERKES: Can we try it right now? I'd like you to read something you have in front of you and let's try it.  Mr. VAN WEINGARTEN: Okay. I have a book here, so. . .  BERKES: I have a book here, so. . .  Mr. VAN WEINGARTEN: The typewritten. . .  BERKES: The typewritten. . .  Mr. VAN WEINGARTEN: . . . fields seems like just. . .  BERKES: . . . fields seems like just. . .  Mr. VAN WEINGARTEN: . . . a big joke.  BERKES: . . . a big joke.  Mr. VAN WEINGARTEN: It's a bit different, this.  BERKES: You did seem confused, though.  Mr. VAN WEINGARTEN: Now, the difference is that there is no particular timing to this. Let's say that you're standing in a crowd and you're trying to chant together but the person standing left to you chooses a slightly faster rhythm than you are choosing. And the person right of you is on another beat altogether. It becomes very difficult to chant synchronously together with your neighbors in the crowd. So what we are doing is we're using loudspeakers to simulate out of sync chanters, people who have no sense of rhythm.  BERKES: Is it possible though that stopping soccer fans from chanting might cause them to get into trouble, or cause trouble in other ways?  Mr. VAN WEINGARTEN: Yes. That's a real concern. You need to be sure that if you frustrate people by disrupting their chanting, that they are not tempted to express themselves in other ways, perhaps even more violent ways. So this is never something that can be done alone. It always has to be done along with other measures.   One thing that we've been thinking of is that what you can try to do is while you suppress an offensive chant you try to artificially start one that's not as offensive but it's also quite catchy. So you're sort of implanting a nice chant in the crowd while you're disrupting the offensive ones.  BERKES: Doctor Sander Van Weingarten of the Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research. Thank you.  Mr. VAN WEINGARTEN: You're welcome.  BERKES: We go now from thundering crowds to tiptoeing thieves. James Sabatier and his colleagues at the University of Mississippi are working on ways to detect someone sneaking around in your house. He'll also be at the Acoustical Society meeting this week. But first we thought we'd ask him about his research. Doctor Sabatier looked at different kinds of footsteps, normal and stealthy.  Dr. JAMES SABATIER (University of Mississippi): As you take a step your heel touches the floor first. And the first thing that happens is, the floor supports your weight. So that then impulsive force sends a signal that propagates through the floor, a vibration signal that propagates through the floor to our receiver. And that signal is low frequency. When the toe comes down, about 100 milliseconds, 150 milliseconds later, it slaps the floor and it stops. It's like slamming on the brakes in your car. And so when that foot slides ever so slightly, it creates another kind of signal, high frequency broadband noise. But mostly it's in the ultrasound.  BERKES: And there's a dramatic difference then in the friction noise between a normal step, a stealthy step and a soft step?  Dr. SABATIER: For us the stealthy step was to walk on tiptoes. When you do that, you don't make the sort of low frequency signal, but the ultrasound or the friction signal is still there.  BERKES: Would it be possible then to perhaps program a home alarm system of some sort that could recognize stealthy steps and warn people that someone's walking around the house stealthily?  Dr. SABATIER: We think this is probably one of the most important things that's come out of this work. One of the problems with home alarm systems is there are too many false alarms. They cannot distinguish a person. So if you can indeed look for this high frequency signal associated with footsteps, you can identify a person. But I don't think that a burglar is going to tippy-toe around your house. A burglar is going to walk normal. So the important thing about finding people is to look for the low frequency signal followed by, 150 milliseconds later, this ultrasound, or high frequency signal. And so that combination of those two I think is unique to the footstep of a person.  BERKES: I have to say I'm a little bit disappointed because I was hoping that his would help me catch my teenage daughter sneaking into the house after curfew.  Dr. SABATIER: Well, it might help with that too. You might be able to do that as well.  BERKES: James Sabatier of the University of Mississippi. Thank you.  Dr. SABATIER: You bet.

But six artists in Irvine, California still see an enormous potential for the pinhole camera, especially in their latest work, the Great Picture Project. Rob Johnson and five other artists have converted a hangar on the old El Toro Marine Air Station into a giant camera obscura. They plan to take a picture of the tarmac and the control tower. If all goes well, the Great Picture Project could lay claim to two titles in the Guinness Book of World Records: World's Largest Camera and World's Largest Photo. Joining us from his home in Fullerton, California is artist Rob Johnson. Welcome to the show, Rob. Mr. ROB JOHNSON (Artist): Thank you very much. HANSEN: Give us a brief primer on how a pinhole camera works. Mr. JOHNSON: It's basically a box with a small hole in one end and through that hole onto the opposing surface inside the box is projected a sharp, clear, upside down and left to right reversed image, and that technology goes back hundreds of years, actually quite far pre-dates the invention of photography actually. HANSEN: All right, how big is your camera? Does the size actually affect how the process works? And what do you use as film? Mr. JOHNSON: Well, our camera is a building, a very large building. It's one of the hangars on the former Marine Corps station El Toro. Our image will be roughly 28 feet tall or about the height of a three-story building, and 108-feet wide, and it will be recorded on an immense piece of muslin and canvass-like material that has been sensitized with black and white light sensitive emulsion called liquid light, which we will be hand applying to the surface of the fabric and then hoisting the fabric into place for the image to record. HANSEN: Now, how big is your aperture? If the building is the box and the doors are where you have the hole, how big is the hole? Mr. JOHNSON: The hole is three quarters of an inch in diameter. So, in terms of camera technology, that's a very, very small aperture for those people that are familiar with camera F-stops. I think we've figured out that our F-stop is roughly F896. HANSEN: How long exposure do you need? And what do you do? I mean, the sun's going to change, is that going to have any affect on how the picture turns out? Mr. JOHNSON: What we're going to be doing over the next week or so is hanging up some sensitized test fabrics and testing the exposure. We think that the exposure will take somewhere between five and ten days, but we're not absolutely certain, which is why we're running the test. HANSEN: How do you develop the film? Mr. JOHNSON: Once the exposure is done, we have to pull this piece of fabric down onto the ground and we can't process it on site. We have to move it in a light-tight container to another location and we have had a company make for us the world's largest photographic tray. It's about 35 feet wide and 120 feet long and it will be four inches deep, and the process we're thinking will take somewhere in the nature of 600 gallons of chemistry to bring this image up. HANSEN: What happens to the camera? What happens to the picture? Mr. JOHNSON: The picture, we hope, will find a home in some museum. We're going to bring it back to the hangar building that we're creating it in and re-suspend it and then it will have to come down and go into at least temporary storage somewhere. HANSEN: Sounds like the biggest one-shot disposable camera I've ever heard. Mr. JOHNSON: That's the comment that I made the other day, because the building that we're photographing in won't exist anymore. Somebody asked me yesterday if we were going to do a before and after kind of picture and I said, well, I don't think that's possible because the building that we're in will be torn down.

I'm Linda Wertheimer. STEVE INSKEEP, host: And I'm Steve Inskeep. Good morning. A rare and as yet incurable illness has brought together two groups in an unusual partnership. Batten Disease is a fatal neurological disorder affecting mostly infants and children. A nearly identical form of the illness can affect dogs, which gives different groups of people a powerful interest in fighting it. NPR Senior Correspondent Ketzel Levine tells the story of what may prove to be a breakthrough collaboration. KETZEL LEVINE reporting: Lorrina Ann Johnston(ph) was born on Groundhog Day in 1971. Her father remembers the way in which her hair grew in, much the same way his was falling out. Her first five years were uncomplicated. Sadly, they'd be the only easy years of her short life. Mr. LANCE JOHNSTON (Executive Director, Batten Disease Support and Research Association): She started with the symptoms when she was about six. And she died at the age of 22. LEVINE: Lance Johnston's daughter had Batten Disease, an inherited genetic defect that leads to a breakdown of the entire nervous system. Lorrina's symptoms began with vision problems and trouble concentrating in school. Later, seizures and finally, dementia. Because the disease was so rare, its symptoms easily mistaken, Lorrina's diagnosis took eight lonely years. Though a diagnosis today might be arrived at more quickly, it remains just as tragic. Which is why the executive director of the Batten Disease Support and Research Association, Lorrina's dad, is determined no one will go it alone. Mr. JOHNSTON: I kind of made a commitment to her. I'm not smart enough to go in the laboratory and find a cure, so I promised her that I would do the next best thing that I could, and that was try to help others. That's been my focus since then. LEVINE: Which has led you to a family of dogs? Mr. JOHNSTON: Yeah. Absolutely. (Soundbite of dogs barking) LEVINE: Meet the family, the Tibetan Terriers. Imagine an English Sheepdog shrunk to knee-high size, and you've got the overall look of a Tibetan. Dozens of these shimmering, healthy, hairy beasts are here going through their paces at a recent Tibetan Terrier dog fest just outside San Francisco. Unidentified Woman: Now, step back a couple of steps, and just call her towards you. LEVINE: Among the more unlikely folks at this regional conference is, in fact, Lance Johnston, whose connection to these critters goes back three years. On a memorable September day, he received a call from the Tibetan Terrier Club of America wanting to talk about a rare but worrying illness in its breed: Batten Disease. The caller was a dog lover, Stuart Eckmann, who simply had a hunch something powerful might happen if the two communities talked. He then invited Lance Johnston, and a few parents of children with the disease, to the 2003 Tibetan Terrier World Congress, where Stuart Eckmann's hunch paid off. Mr. STUART ECKMANN (Co-Chairman, Health Committee, Tibetan Terrier Club of America): We were describing an unusual head tilt in the Tibetan Terrier, and one of the parents said, I know what that is. That's a mini seizure and she said that's the way her son reacted when he was first affected. Mr. JOHNSTON: And it - just like a light bulb lit up in the whole room. LEVINE: Lance Johnston. Mr. JOHNSTON: And all of a sudden people are thinking, wow! Here's two very similar things going on and we're learning from each other. It was like two families coming together. LEVINE: The two communities have been exchanging information ever since, even teamed up to fund some of the same research, hoping that by pooling resources they will accelerate a cure. Unidentified Woman: Lance. . . LEVINE: At this Tibetan Terrier Conference, sponsored by the Canine Health Foundation, participants have gathered to hear scientists discuss the latest inroads into Batten Disease, among them, stem cell research. Outside the conference hall, parents of both species mingle, as do their children and their dogs. Unidentified Woman: He's looking at you. Unidentified Child: (Unintelligible). LEVINE: Katie Allio(ph) is a soft-spoken teenager with Batten Disease. She is Wheelchair-bound and blind. Six-year-old Daniel Kerner(ph) is also in a Wheelchair, his limbs and language erratic. Mr. JOHNSTON: It sounds crazy that Tibetan Terriers and little children that are terminally ill are bonded together by a disease in common. But that's the reality. LEVINE: Daniel's father, Marcus Kerner, and Katie's mother, Kathy Allio(ph), are meeting here for the first time in a difficult but ritualized exchange. Mr. MARCUS KERNER: When did it start? Ms. KATHY ALLIO (Mother): Well, with Katie, it started, the onset started at five with vision. With Annie, I believe I saw for her first seizure at age one. Mr. KERNER: For Daniel, it started at 2 years old, language regression. LEVINE: With increasing emotion as he tells his son's story, Marcus Kerner leans into Kathy Allio's arms. Mr. KERNER: And he'll wither away and blow out just like a candle. And all you'll see is the smoke. Ms. ALLIO: It's okay, you're going to survive this. LEVINE: Two of Kathy Allio's six children have Batten disease, including her youngest, seven year old Annie. She admits she was initially conflicted about collaborating with dog owners, feeling there was nothing comparable about a sick child and a sick dog. Ms. ALLIO: But it wasn't about a dog or a child and which was more important; it was about fighting a disease. Uniting is a wonderful idea, because our first desire besides, of course, a cure and our children being whole, would be awareness. LEVINE: Awareness that this fatal disease exists and begs for attention. Just outside the hotel, hunched in a warm, light rain, a young woman and her shivering dog stand apart from the community, hesitant to step in. Is he shaking because he's cold? Ms. ERIKA GASPAR: I think he's scared; he doesn't like newness. It's too much for him to process. LEVINE: Erika Gaspar fears her dog Misha has Batten disease. She's about to consult with the doctor in this cross-species collaboration, researcher Martin Katz. Ms. GASPAR: This is Misha. Dr. MARTIN KATZ, (Professor of Opthamology, University of Missouri): Hi, Misha. Ms. GASPAR: She's a little nervous. Dr. KATZ: I see your dog seems to have visual problems the way he's moving, and that one of the early signs of the disease. LEVINE: Dr. Katz was well into his human Batten disease research at the University of Missouri when he was offered a Canine Health Foundation grant to also help Tibetan terriers; the caveat, no lab animals. He could only work with the pet population, that is, family dogs. Dr. KATZ: Well, I come from a background of many years of working with rats and mice as laboratory research animals where you could control everything, and I thought this is impossible; there's no way you can do this type of research that depends on the pet population. But I've learned over the years that it is possible; surprise - I was pleasantly surprised. LEVINE: In part, because of all the new research tools now available to him, including an innovative Tibetan Terrier DNA bank. With it, Dr. Katz has been able to compare genes in healthy and diseased animals. He's also been able to identify the disorder in several other breeds. While his personal priorities remain human well-being, Martin Katz's approach to his work has been radically and humanely changed. Ms. GASPAR: Misha, give me paw.  Mimi, give me paw. LEVINE: Sadly, given the limitations of current research, Dr. Katz cannot give Erika Gaspar a definitive diagnosis. She's very sad clearly, but her posture has changed, perhaps less burdened, feeling less alone; which is reason enough why this extended family, galvanized by a rare disease, believes it's on to something, having reached beyond the boundaries of two isolated communities to come together, shepherd change, and perhaps find a cure. Ketzel Levine, NPR News. (Soundbite of music) INSKEEP: Six children with Batten disease will soon take part in a clinical trial at Oregon Health and Science University in Portland. It's a preliminary test to see if a type of stem cell therapy might one day to be used as treatments for some forms of the disease. Marcus Kerner, who we heard earlier in this report, is hoping his son Daniel will be chosen for that trial.

That's a mini seizure and she said that's the way her son reacted when he was first affected.  Mr. JOHNSTON: And it - just like a light bulb lit up in the whole room.  LEVINE: Lance Johnston.  Mr. JOHNSTON: And all of a sudden people are thinking, wow! Here's two very similar things going on and we're learning from each other. It was like two families coming together.  LEVINE: The two communities have been exchanging information ever since, even teamed up to fund some of the same research, hoping that by pooling resources they will accelerate a cure.  Unidentified Woman: Lance. . .  LEVINE: At this Tibetan Terrier Conference, sponsored by the Canine Health Foundation, participants have gathered to hear scientists discuss the latest inroads into Batten Disease, among them, stem cell research.  Outside the conference hall, parents of both species mingle, as do their children and their dogs.  Unidentified Woman: He's looking at you.  Unidentified Child: (Unintelligible).  LEVINE: Katie Allio(ph) is a soft-spoken teenager with Batten Disease. She is Wheelchair-bound and blind. Six-year-old Daniel Kerner(ph) is also in a Wheelchair, his limbs and language erratic.  Mr. JOHNSTON: It sounds crazy that Tibetan Terriers and little children that are terminally ill are bonded together by a disease in common. But that's the reality.  LEVINE: Daniel's father, Marcus Kerner, and Katie's mother, Kathy Allio(ph), are meeting here for the first time in a difficult but ritualized exchange.  Mr. MARCUS KERNER: When did it start?  Ms. KATHY ALLIO (Mother): Well, with Katie, it started, the onset started at five with vision. With Annie, I believe I saw for her first seizure at age one.  Mr. KERNER: For Daniel, it started at 2 years old, language regression.  LEVINE: With increasing emotion as he tells his son's story, Marcus Kerner leans into Kathy Allio's arms.  Mr. KERNER: And he'll wither away and blow out just like a candle. And all you'll see is the smoke.  Ms. ALLIO: It's okay, you're going to survive this.  LEVINE: Two of Kathy Allio's six children have Batten disease, including her youngest, seven year old Annie. She admits she was initially conflicted about collaborating with dog owners, feeling there was nothing comparable about a sick child and a sick dog.  Ms. ALLIO: But it wasn't about a dog or a child and which was more important; it was about fighting a disease. Uniting is a wonderful idea, because our first desire besides, of course, a cure and our children being whole, would be awareness.  LEVINE: Awareness that this fatal disease exists and begs for attention. Just outside the hotel, hunched in a warm, light rain, a young woman and her shivering dog stand apart from the community, hesitant to step in.  Is he shaking because he's cold?  Ms. ERIKA GASPAR: I think he's scared; he doesn't like newness. It's too much for him to process.  LEVINE: Erika Gaspar fears her dog Misha has Batten disease. She's about to consult with the doctor in this cross-species collaboration, researcher Martin Katz.  Ms. GASPAR: This is Misha.  Dr. MARTIN KATZ, (Professor of Opthamology, University of Missouri): Hi, Misha.  Ms. GASPAR: She's a little nervous.  Dr. KATZ: I see your dog seems to have visual problems the way he's moving, and that one of the early signs of the disease.  LEVINE: Dr. Katz was well into his human Batten disease research at the University of Missouri when he was offered a Canine Health Foundation grant to also help Tibetan terriers; the caveat, no lab animals. He could only work with the pet population, that is, family dogs.  Dr. KATZ: Well, I come from a background of many years of working with rats and mice as laboratory research animals where you could control everything, and I thought this is impossible; there's no way you can do this type of research that depends on the pet population. But I've learned over the years that it is possible; surprise - I was pleasantly surprised.  LEVINE: In part, because of all the new research tools now available to him, including an innovative Tibetan Terrier DNA bank. With it, Dr. Katz has been able to compare genes in healthy and diseased animals. He's also been able to identify the disorder in several other breeds.  While his personal priorities remain human well-being, Martin Katz's approach to his work has been radically and humanely changed.  Ms. GASPAR: Misha, give me paw.  Mimi, give me paw.  LEVINE: Sadly, given the limitations of current research, Dr. Katz cannot give Erika Gaspar a definitive diagnosis. She's very sad clearly, but her posture has changed, perhaps less burdened, feeling less alone; which is reason enough why this extended family, galvanized by a rare disease, believes it's on to something, having reached beyond the boundaries of two isolated communities to come together, shepherd change, and perhaps find a cure.  Ketzel Levine, NPR News.  (Soundbite of music)  INSKEEP: Six children with Batten disease will soon take part in a clinical trial at Oregon Health and Science University in Portland. It's a preliminary test to see if a type of stem cell therapy might one day to be used as treatments for some forms of the disease.  Marcus Kerner, who we heard earlier in this report, is hoping his son Daniel will be chosen for that trial.

I'm Michele Norris. ROBERT SIEGEL, Host: And I'm Robert Siegel. Scientists have found evidence that the human urge to create art dates back at least 100,000 years. They have found snail shells that ancient humans appeared to have fashioned into decorative beads. NPR's Jon Hamilton reports. JON HAMILTON: Archaeological discoveries are supposed to require lots of tedious digging. This one didn't. A French scientist named Francesco d'Errico ran into a friend at a conference. They got to talking about some snail shells at a museum in London. The friend said -FRANCESCO D: Why don't you come to London and try to see whether you can make something out of it. So, in fact, it was very easy way. HAMILTON: A British archaeologist had actually dug up the snail shells in Israel in the 1930s. The shells eventually landed in London's Natural History Museum, where they didn't get much attention. Until a few years ago. That's when d'Errico and other scientists found 41 similar shells in South Africa. The South African shells had holes in them and they'd apparently strung together as beads. D'Errico says they were in layers of earth that also contained tools and pigments used of painting. ERRICO: And these layers are dated by two different dating methods. It's around the 75,000 years ago. HAMILTON: That made the shell beads the earliest known example of personal decoration, a hallmark of modern human culture. But d'Errico thought there might be even older shell beads somewhere else. So he accepted his friend's invitation to check out the shells in London. It turned out that two of them had holes punched in them, just like the ones in South Africa. But tests showed they were 25,000 years older than the South African shells. Then d'Errico found another shell bead in a museum in Paris. It's from Algeria and may be 90,000 years old. And d'Errico says he knows about some other ancient shell beads. ERRICO: And I cannot say too much about it because otherwise the colleagues in Rome, they will probably kill me. HAMILTON: The shell beads are just the latest finding that may help explain something called the creative explosion. It was a burst of sophisticated tool making and art in Europe that signaled the arrival of modern humans. But Curtis Marion, from Arizona State University, says the shell beads show that early human living in Africa were beginning to express artistic ideas. CURTIS MARION: When they moved into Europe 40,000 years ago, bam, they start to express themselves in a very complicated way through their material culture. HAMILTON: They made cave paintings, jewelry, musical instruments. What changed probably wasn't the people, but the weather. And Marion says humans tend to produce a lot more cultural artifacts when it's cold out. MARION: Go into a museum Sunday and take a look at the material culture of the Eskimo. I mean, it's extremely complex with carved figurines and all kinds of stuff like that. And that's not the case with tropical hunters and gatherers. HAMILTON: They just don't leave much behind.

That's how you got around, after all. The Lone Star State is still home to more than a million horses, and some Texans have begun adding to their herds in rather unusual ways: by cloning their champion horses.  From Dallas, NPR's Wade Goodwyn reports. WADE GOODWYN reporting: When you think about cloning, the first images that pop into your mind don't necessarily involve pastoral beauty, maybe a T-rex chasing down Jeff Goldblum instead, or a big guy named Frank with stitches in his forehead, waiting to get hit by lightening. (Soundbite of horse whinny) GOODWYN: Instead, here in Weatherford, about 20 miles west of Fort Worth, the face of cloning is a perfect, 4-month-old filly, tied to a tree branch in the middle of some of the most beautiful horse country in Texas. Ms. ELAINE HALL (Owner, Royal Blue Boon II): Hi, sugar britches. This is the second time today you've been fooled with. (Soundbite of horse whinny) GOODWYN: Elaine Hall is the owner of Royal Blue Boon II, a clone of one of the greatest cutting horses of all time: Royal Blue Boon.  Ms. HALL: She is truly the very same steel blue color that her identical twin is. I still - every time I look at her - it's just a miracle. I can't believe it's really here and it's Royal Blue Boon again. GOODWYN: Hall says this filly will never be trained to be a cutting horse champion, because that's unnecessary. The clone's template, Royal Blue Boon, has already proved all there is to prove in the arena.  Cutting horse competitions evolved out of the necessity of cowboys having to separate calves from the herd. Those little calves are quick, and their desire to get back to their mothers is intense. A great cutting horse can block the calf from the herd like a point guard keeping his man from the basket: back and forth. In the cutting horse world, Royal Blue Boon was as famous as Michael Jordan. Elaine Hall says she can already see Royal Blue Boon's qualities in Royal Blue Boon II. Ms. HALL: Royal Blue Boon always had this spunk about her, where if she didn't like something, or if she got real intense on working on a cow, she would pin those ears back. This little horse does the same thing. When she gets really focused on something and it doesn't particularly agree with her, her ears will be just flat back. GOODWYN: Royal Blue Boon, the original, is now 26 years old. She's an aging brood mare, retired and a little achy. But Royal Blue Boon II has her whole life ahead of her. She could produce a long line of cutting champions. Ms. HALL: So, when the opportunity was there, I decided that I should take it, because even though I may be old-fashioned and not very high-tech, if you don't stay up with all the high-tech, then I know that you're going to fall behind in the dust and be left in the dust. GOODWYN: The sport is giving birth to a commercial horse cloning industry in Texas, and ViaGen, in high-tech Austin, is leading the way. Dr. IRINA POLEJAEVA (Senior Vice President of Research, ViaGen, Inc. ): Here's the tissue culture lab where we process the tissue. You can see these two incubators where cells are cultured at specific temperature. GOODWYN: Irina Polejaeva is the genetic scientist in charge at ViaGen, and a leader in animal cloning. Her technicians take a horse embryo and first suck out the embryo's DNA. Dr. POLEJAEVA: There's two pipettes, or holders - one holder/pipette will fix the egg in a certain condition. We will visualize DNA inside of the egg. We're using specific dye. So we can see the DNA in the bluish color, because it's stained. GOODWYN: Into the now empty egg is fused to the champion's DNA. A small tissue sample suffices. This is all very new. The scientists at ViaGen are still learning, and their success rate is below 40 percent. That's one reason why it costs $150,000 to clone a horse. But as the scientists at ViaGen get better, that price will come down. Mr. MARK WALTON (President, ViaGen, Inc. ): We certainly intend to get better. We've seen it in pigs and we've seen it in cattle, and we're no where close to the top of the efficiency curve. We don't know what the real maximum efficiency is going to be. GOODWYN: Mark Walton is the president of ViaGen. Walton fully understands that cloning is not fully accepted yet.  Mr. WALTON: There's this definite perception, this science-fiction kind of a perception, and I think, people hear the word cloning, and they envision that in our lab, we've got giant beakers that are bubbling away, and out pops a full-grown horse. GOODWYN: But humans have been artificially breeding horses since Arabian chieftains began to artificially inseminate their white Arabians 500 years ago. Now cloning is giving owners of champions a powerful new tool to improve their bloodlines and their pocketbooks. But not everyone is on board, especially not thoroughbred racing. Mr. ALAN MARZELLI (President, The Jockey Club, USA): I think it's all a bit ghoulish. I think there's a point at which the science goes too far, and I think, personally speaking, whether it's humans or animals, cloning is about too far. GOODWYN: Alan Marzelli is the president of the U. S. Jockey Club, the breed registry for American thoroughbreds. Not only is the Jockey Club opposed to cloning but any type of assisted reproduction. That stand, rooted in thoroughbred tradition, has become increasingly controversial. The injury to Kentucky Derby winner, Barbaro, has only served to ratchet up the discussion.  If Barbaro can't manage to mount a mare, he would be lost as a stud forever, a staggering sum financially. But if Barbaro was a cutting horse, it wouldn't be a problem. In fact, cutting horse owners don't usually let their valuable champions mate naturally; it's too risky, like having your star quarterback ride around on a motorcycle.  When it comes to assisted reproduction, the Jockey Club is at one end of the spectrum, the National Cutting Horse Association the other. But the very first equines ever cloned actually weren't horses at all, they were racing mules named Idaho Gem and Idaho Star. Now three years old, they recently competed in their very first professional race in Winnemucca, Nevada. Unidentified Man: Go! GOODWYN: Dirk Vanderwall and Gordon Woods from the University of Idaho and Ken White from Utah State collaborated to create Idaho Gem and Idaho Star. Vanderwall was in Winnemucca. Dr. DIRK VANDERWALL (Professor of Animal and Veterinary Sciences, University of Idaho; Director, Northwest Equine Reproduction Laboratory): In just the outcome on Saturday, with Idaho Gem winning his elimination race and Idaho Star winning his elimination race, it just, you know, it's sort of storybook, sort of script that you couldn't have written it any better than that. GOODWYN: When both clones won their respective heats, it made headlines across the nation. The American Mule Racing Association has decided cloned mules and their heirs are okay to compete.  Back in Austin, Texas, ViaGen predicts that the company will produce as many as 30 more cloned horses over the next year. Wade Goodwyn, NPR News, Dallas.

She looked nothing like the ewe who gave birth to her, because Dolly was the first animal cloned from an adult cell. Dolly went on to mate and give birth to six healthy lambs. Dolly was such an amazing accomplishment that when she died in 2003, many of the people, oh, around the world, felt that loss. And today, of course, animal cloning is common. But Dolly's creation triggered fiery debates over human cloning that are still very much alive. Ian Wilmut is an embryologist who was a member of the team at Scotland's Roslin Institute that cloned Dolly back in 1996. He is opposed to cloning human babies, but he says he's a passionate advocate of what he calls a restricted form of human cloning. And now he's taking a long considered look back, and forward as well. And he's put it all in a new book called, After Dolly: The Uses and Misuses of Human Cloning, which is co-authored with Roger Highfield. Dr. Wilmut is professor of reproductive science at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland. And I'm happy and honored to have him here today at SCIENCE FRIDAY. Welcome. . . Professor IAN WILMUT (Co-Author, After Dolly: The Uses and Misuses of Human Cloning; Professor of Reproductive Science, University of Edinburgh): Thank you for inviting me. FLATOW: . . . to the program. You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY, from NPR News. You've been listening to all this cloning talk. And 10 years ago, who would have thought, right? Dr. WILMUT: I mean, I think it's amazing to think that it's already 10 years ago that she was born. And a lot has happened, but I think there's a lot still to come. FLATOW: You know, I never asked a guest in 15 years of doing this, what's new? What's new, Dr. Wilmut? Dr. WILMUT: I think there are a lot of things coming. FLATOW: Yes. Dr. WILMUT: Using this technology to try to understand human disease, to develop new treatments for them. Maybe, remembering this is a book which is looking a long way into the future, being able to use it to stop the birth of children with inherited disease. I think there are a lot of things which I would encourage people to think about and to be optimistic about this technology and what it can offer. FLATOW: What effect - and has the South Korean scandal had a lasting effect on the whole cloning issue? Dr. WILMUT: Yes, it has. You would understand it if women were rather more cautious about offering to donate blastocysts for research and under these circumstances. And clearly, we'll have to be very careful to restore confidence in this. I think you also have to feel sorry for patients, potential patients in Korea, who were promised treatments by Dr. Hwang and his colleagues. So it was a very sad event. FLATOW: You - I mentioned at the beginning in the introduction that you believe in human cloning to a limited extent. Just define for us. Dr. WILMUT: I think you have to ask very carefully what it is that you have in mind. The application that I've never supported is the idea of producing somebody who is a genetically identical twin of a person who is here. But I think it - to me, it would be acceptable to produce embryos from which you could get cells and to produce a baby in which you had corrected a genetic disease. But it would not be a clone of somebody who was here already. It would be, if you like, a clone of an embryo. And it's being done for a different purpose. So it's very important all the time to say exactly what you have in mind. FLATOW: Talking with Dr. Ian Wilmut, who, along with Roger Highfield, wrote a fascinating new book, After Dolly: The Uses and Misuses of Human Cloning. Our number, 1-800-989-8255. Different countries are all sort of splitting up their ideas about this, are they not? Dr. WILMUT: Yes, they certainly are. There's a great variety of different opinions. The United Kingdom, where I work, has some of the most liberal approaches to this. But it is very tightly regulated, which I think is entirely appropriate. But there are many countries in which research with embryos of any kind is limited and nuclear transfer itself would be prohibited. FLATOW: So is it possible that there might be rogue scientists out there who, themselves, would take on human cloning for a person? Dr. WILMUT: I think is extraordinarily unlikely. The people who've talked about this in the past, it seems to me, have been advertising themselves but actually not doing anything. And I think this is a fear which is greatly exaggerated. FLATOW: What kind of regulation do you think we need? International regulation? Dr. WILMUT: I think that would be preferable. But given the different cultural histories, it may not be easy to achieve it. And so I'd be quite content to see each country preparing its own regulations. And it is, of course, very disappointing that this country hasn't done so. FLATOW: Do you think it's inevitable that we're going to have a cloned person? Dr. WILMUT: No. FLATOW: No. Not like nuclear proliferation where there's going to be, you know, cloning proliferation somewhere. Dr. WILMUT: It might happen. But I think it depends on how we behave. And I think that it is quite possible for societies - it is, of course, possible for societies to come to different conclusions. But I think, you know, a perception that we should have is that there are disadvantages to most technologies. We're using electronic equipment to make this broadcast, which comes from essentially the same physics that blew up to a Japanese city sixty years ago. What's key all the time is for societies to discuss things, to be informed about things - which clearly you make a great contribution to - and then to prepare regulations. FLATOW: All right. We're going to take a short break and come back and talk lots more with Ian Wilmut, who, along with Roger Highfield, have written, After Dolly: The Uses and Misuses of Human Cloning. We'll take your calls, 1-800-989-8255. So stay with us. We'll be right back after this short break. (Soundbite of music) I'm Ira Flatow. This is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY, from NPR News. (Soundbite of music) You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow. We're talking about human cloning with my guest, Ian Wilmut, co-author of, After Dolly, The Uses and Misuses of Human Cloning, co-author with Roger Highfield. Our number is 1-800-989-8255. Do you think there is a - there is a concerted effort to mischaracterize what human cloning is? And I want to just bring this up for - I was at a conference a couple years ago. We were talking about human embryonic research. And we described the blastocyst. And I know you have a whole chapter in here that says, is a blastocyst a person? And we talked about the ball of cells. And a delegate from the United Nations happened to be in the audience. And he came up and said, you know, in the last three minutes I learned more about human cloning, the truth about it, than I learned in 30 years as being a delegate to the UN. It almost sounded to me like they were stabbing babies to get cells out of them. Dr. WILMUT: Yes, you described this as being a sort of deliberate misleading. And I'm not sure if I would describe it like that, but I'm sure there is a great ignorance about this. And this was one of the reasons for writing the book, to explain exactly what is involved, the stage of developments of embryo from which we take the cells, and to try to lift people's eyes to a greater horizon as to what can be achieved by research in this area. That was our aim. FLATOW: Has it been oversold? You know, we talk about genetic engineering. We haven't seen a whole lot from that yet. Dr. WILMUT: I think in the short-term, perhaps it has. There are different time scales on there. People doing research have to be optimists to follow that way of life. And it may be that inadvertently we do oversell things. But in the long run, no, I don't think it's been oversold. There'll be a lot of things come from this area of research. FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255. Clair(ph) in St. Louis. Hi, Clair. CLAIR (Caller): How are you? FLATOW: Go ahead. CLAIR: There's been a case in the United States, a deaf couple wanted to have a deaf child, consulted with a doctor, and he told them yes, he could determine which of their embryos would be deaf, but he would not allow them to select for deafness. He'd allow to select against it, but not to allow to select for deafness. And there's also research into cures for deafness. But I was wondering, with the talk of cloning and genetic treatment, how to handle that fine line between what is a disease that needs treating and what's simply a human variation. Dr. WILMUT: I think that's an excellent question. And it's quite clear that there's a hugely difficult topic here, as to exactly where you would draw the line. I might use an example of a very unpleasant disease, and you're putting your finger on one which is not as difficult. I think the way in which you deal with the issue is to try to have advice available from people who are not involved very directly in the particular case so that they would not stand to make any money from it. People - the researchers, like myself, would not stand to benefit from it and to have counselors provide the information. These are subjective judgments. My own hunch is that I would probably have agreed with the doctor, that it would be more appropriate under these circumstances for a child to have the full range of opportunities. But I do understand why deaf parents might make a different choice. FLATOW: Thank you for calling. CLAIR: Thank you. FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255. A chapter - a part of your book is called The Yuk Factor, and you talk about the very idea that some things are natural and others not raises more questions. And this is in reference to: Is it natural to work with human embryos. Dr. WILMUT: And I think that what we, I think, go on to try to explain is that what happens each time that people enter a new area there is a response of that kind. And it happens to everybody, so that I might feel that about somebody working a different area of biology that I was not familiar with. Often what then happens is that we can come to learn about it, to understand it, and to make a judgment as to what we are comfortable with. What almost worries me more than this initial response is that we very quickly come to take for granted something which has recently been developed, so that within my 60-year lifespan - if you think of, for example, organ transplantation, IVF, there was that sort of response when both of these, each of these, was introduced. But now we take it for granted. The significance of this is that people don't understand that each of them came from years of basic research to create a new opportunity. There are, I believe, more opportunities still to come from biomedical research than all of the advances that we've had so far. And just think how many those there are. But what we need is basic research to ask as many fundamental questions as we can, in order to maximize the number of opportunities that we have available. And I'm at least as afraid of the fact that people take for granted the opportunities each generation have and do not look forward to the future. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. So how do you answer people who say, I just can't - I can't morally condone this. Dr. WILMUT: I understand that to some people what we're suggesting is deeply offensive. And, of course, I accept that there are different points of view. In terms of working with embryos, I would wish to be sure that they understood exactly the stage of development that we would be working with. The embryo is smaller than a grain of sand. The micromanipulations we carry out with very sophisticated equipment and very skilled colleagues, of course, and that its weeks before the time when there would be the beginnings of a nervous system. Now, to me personally, the key human characteristic is being conscious, aware, being able to form intellectual relationships with people, something, which, of course, would happen much, much later in the life of a developing person. But until the point when that begins to occur, which is sometime after the stage we would take cells, I think this is a potential person, but not yet a person. And that's the reason why, to me, it's an acceptable thing to do. FLATOW: Scott(ph) in Jackson, Michigan. Hi, welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. SCOTT (Caller): Hi. Um, the comment I'd like to make is that I think this cloning issue represents the same problem that you see in botany today, where by genetically engineering animals, you get the same problem you have with the plants. That you can introduce genetic material into a living organism which still has the capability of reproducing itself in the traditional way. So just as you have, say, genetically engineered corn, cross-pollinating, you know, traditional corn, you know, and thereby, you know, polluting that corn with, say, genetic material from a shrimp, say, you could create a sheep, for instance, that has a pigment gene from, oh, from a plant, for instance. And you know, okay, great, you know. We get a sheep that, you know, grows a particular new color of wool, you know. But then that sheep can still reproduce in the traditional way with other sheep. And so, suddenly, how did this gene from, say, a maple tree or something, you know, get into, you know, the genetic code of sheep, you know? So I think that that's - I think something that should be considered, that this genetic engineering of animals, you know, is the same - you know, represents the same problem of genetic pollution essentially. That, you know, you're going to get -it's a way for genetic material to, I guess, jump across the species barrier, you know? FLATOW: Yeah, that's interesting. Let Dr. Wilmut answer that. Dr. WILMUT: Yeah, let me make a couple of points. It is actually easier to identify and recover animals which have been genetically modified, if you really want to, than it is to go fetch back all of the maize plants that are scattered around the Midwest. It is a totally different of magnitude, as it's quite feasible. But let me also suggest to you that people wouldn't actually be interested in that sort of comparatively trivial approach. Let's consider instead that it is possible to change cows so that they could not be susceptible to Mad Cow Disease. It may be possible to change cows so that they would be resistant to foot and mouth disease. Now, I would suggest to you that those are two objectives which it is well worth considering not only for the benefits of the people who may ultimately consume milk and meat from them, but also for the animals themselves. FLATOW: All right. Thanks for calling, Scott. SCOTT: Thanks. FLATOW: Well, what about creating animals that grow our body parts? Hearts and things like that? Dr. WILMUT: Yeah. One project, which a couple of groups certainly are still pursuing intensively, is the idea of changing pigs so that their organs can be used in people. And there is at least a handful of papers now showing that by making a particular genetic change, the organs are able to cope with blood from primates, not from human beings, but much better than anything in the past. I think it's still some way away. There are a lot of challenges still to overcome, but it is something that people are still considering. FLATOW: Could you change enough genes so that you're actually making a human heart inside the pig? Dr. WILMUT: I think probably not. The logistics of that would be very difficult. But whether we can change enough pig genes to make it acceptable, I think that isn't clear either, because we don't understand the problem enough yet. FLATOW: And then we talk about the problem of bringing other viruses and things (unintelligible). Dr. WILMUT: Of course. That is the major issue, there would be a risk. And, of course, the context is different. Not - because what could happen in saving the life of one person is that you could put the entire human community at risk. And so the risk-benefit analysis is very different from when you're considering treatment of a particular person. FLATOW: Is it Chi Chi(ph), in Portland? Hi there. CHI CHI (Caller): Hi. I've got a quick question. Much less controversial. When do you think it'll be affordable, meaning, say, under $10,000, to clone a dog? Dr. WILMUT: It's very difficult to know all of these things, I'm afraid. With the present technologies, as you know, the efficiency is very low and the cost very high. What we need for many of these applications is another jump in efficiency, which is comparable to that which enabled us to produce Dolly. Whether it will come from one more big step or from lots of little ones which will accumulate, it's impossible to know. And who knows what it will be or when it will come. I'm sorry not to be clearer than that. FLATOW: Phil(ph) in Syracuse. Hi and welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. PHIL (Caller): Yes, hi there. Let's see. I have a question about human cloning to produce a human being. And I guess my question is, why is that considered bad, unethical? It seems the politically correct thing to say nowadays is to say you're against human cloning for that. FLATOW: So you could bring back your bother if he had died early, or a relative, somebody like that? PHIL: Or anything like that. And, in fact, there are millions of clones out there today, and they're called identical twins. And I'm thinking, this - why not people who might want to have a clone of themselves. It'd be interesting I think for psychology to see how this person - identical twin who's maybe 20 or 30 years difference in age turns out. And so I'd like to ask your guest what is so ethically wrong with that? I see nothing wrong with it myself. Dr. WILMUT: I think the fundamental difference you've already identified is that the twins would be of a different age. The two who are the same age actually I think do face some pressures as it is, because they're expected to be the same. And if they are the same age. . . PHIL: But what's wrong with that, though? Dr. WILMUT: And if they are the same age the consequences are not too great. But if they are different, I think it's imposing an expectation on the younger child. PHIL: Parents (unintelligible) have expectations (unintelligible). FLATOW: Well, what if you had a newborn and you just started the cloning right there and gave a twin immediately. Dr. WILMUT: I mean, there the difference would be less. But I think you're right that parents do impose expectations. There will be many people listening to this who could tell you that that's deeply to be regretted and we should do everything we can to avoid amplifying those pressures. That's the reason why I don't like the idea. FLATOW: All right, thanks for calling. PHIL: You're welcome. FLATOW: You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY, from NPR News. I'm Ira Flatow talking with William - with William! - Ian Wilmut, who's author of After Dolly: The Uses and Misuses Human Cloning. It's getting late. I'm not speaking well anymore. Co-author with Roger Highfield. Our number, 1-800-989-8255. Despite the U. K. support for stem cell research, that's not true throughout the European Union. And we mentioned - why is there such a difference between the Union's, the countries? Dr. WILMUT: Well, I think the history is very different. If you pick out, for example, Germany, which has a very strong conservative group who oppose this, Catholic countries like Italy and Spain who oppose for different reasons, I think it just simply reflects the history. And I believe it's possible that over a period of time, a few decades, that these differences will become less and it will become possible to have a consistent legislation across all the countries. FLATOW: You'd think the EU might want a David Beckham or a Wayne Rooney or somebody like that. Dr. WILMUT: Oh, probably not. We might like some resilience I think. It's the other way around, yeah. (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: World Cup, we're speaking World Cup talk in case - Americans audiences don't know what you're talking about. Dr. WILMUT: No, I understand, I understand. FLATOW: We lost yesterday, so that's another story. Dr. WILMUT: Yes, I saw that too, yes. FLATOW: So where do you think the future is? Give me some steps to the future as you might map it out. Dr. WILMUT: Well, I think that it would be really good to be able to increase the efficiency, to understand why the nuclear reprogram doesn't work more accurately. And that would then facilitate everything that we do. But I think a fairly nearby - near thing is to be able to produce cells which have the characteristics of a patient with ALS, for example, which is a disease mentioned earlier in your program, which is a relentlessly progressive disease, which means people lose control of their limbs and ultimately die because they stop breathing. A very sad situation. It isn't understood. Now, one problem is that the nerves which are affected are deep inside the body, so the researchers can't get access to them to study them. If we produce cells from cloned embryos from a person who had inherited the disease, it would be possible for the first time to study those cells as they begin to change for the very first time, to understand it and hopefully to develop a high throughput drug screening system which would enable us to assess thousands of drugs and hopefully identify something which could stabilize the position of patients. I think that's - it would be five, ten, fifteen years before that program would be completed. Probably ten years before it would be completed. But I think there is a realistic hope that that would bring forward the first drug to be able to stabilize the position of patients. And just imagine what that would mean to somebody. FLATOW: Yeah. I also think once you get a breakthrough on one of these things, the opposition melts away. Dr. WILMUT: I believe that. And we haven't got time before the end of your program to list the number of diseases which could be studied in that way. I mean they vary from some causes of sudden death because of heart failure, cancer, psychiatric disease, other neurodegenerative disease. There's a huge range of inherited diseases that we don't understand and for which there isn't a treatment. FLATOW: Yeah, because we've already seen in this country opposition by some very conservative members of Congress. . . Dr. WILMUT: Yes. FLATOW: . . . evaporating because they have relatives who suffer from some of these diseases. Dr. WILMUT: Yes. Yes. And, you know, among your audience, there will be many people who already have one of these conditions or will have a family member or a work colleague who has these conditions. And because we're living longer we have more chance of succumbing to them and suffering that fate ourselves. FLATOW: And once somebody shows the first pathway that it can happen, then others will want to jump in and they'll say why did you leave us out? Dr. WILMUT: Yep. Yep. I believe this is true. I mean, I do respect the opinions of other people, of course. It's their right to have different views. But I think you're absolutely right. It will be come acceptable. FLATOW: So where do you go from here, now? Dr. WILMUT: Well, the other thing that we would like to do is to understand cloning, because there's another thing which I believe ultimately will be the greatest inheritance of the Dolly experiment, which is by understanding cloning I think we may be able to change cells of one type, somebody mentioned corpus cells earlier on, into another type, without making an embryo. And that would facilitate the idea of patient-specific cells. And I think it's in that sort of way that by making biologists think differently the Dolly experiment has been most important of all. FLATOW: You'd do away with the ethical problem. Dr. WILMUT: Yes. FLATOW: Yeah. Good luck to you. Dr. WILMUT: Thank you. FLATOW: And thank you for taking time to be with us. Dr. Ian Wilmut, professor of reproductive science at the University of Edinburgh, and co-author with Roger Highfield of After Dolly: The Uses and Misuses of Human Cloning. A very interesting book. I highly recommend it.  IRA FLATOW, host:  Ten years ago, a fetching newborn lamb named Dolly made headlines and magazine covers around the world. She looked nothing like the ewe who gave birth to her, because Dolly was the first animal cloned from an adult cell.  Dolly went on to mate and give birth to six healthy lambs. Dolly was such an amazing accomplishment that when she died in 2003, many of the people, oh, around the world, felt that loss.  And today, of course, animal cloning is common. But Dolly's creation triggered fiery debates over human cloning that are still very much alive.  Ian Wilmut is an embryologist who was a member of the team at Scotland's Roslin Institute that cloned Dolly back in 1996. He is opposed to cloning human babies, but he says he's a passionate advocate of what he calls a restricted form of human cloning. And now he's taking a long considered look back, and forward as well. And he's put it all in a new book called, After Dolly: The Uses and Misuses of Human Cloning, which is co-authored with Roger Highfield.  Dr. Wilmut is professor of reproductive science at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland. And I'm happy and honored to have him here today at SCIENCE FRIDAY. Welcome. . .  Professor IAN WILMUT (Co-Author, After Dolly: The Uses and Misuses of Human Cloning; Professor of Reproductive Science, University of Edinburgh): Thank you for inviting me.  FLATOW: . . . to the program. You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY, from NPR News.  You've been listening to all this cloning talk. And 10 years ago, who would have thought, right?  Dr. WILMUT: I mean, I think it's amazing to think that it's already 10 years ago that she was born. And a lot has happened, but I think there's a lot still to come.  FLATOW: You know, I never asked a guest in 15 years of doing this, what's new? What's new, Dr. Wilmut?  Dr. WILMUT: I think there are a lot of things coming.  FLATOW: Yes.  Dr. WILMUT: Using this technology to try to understand human disease, to develop new treatments for them. Maybe, remembering this is a book which is looking a long way into the future, being able to use it to stop the birth of children with inherited disease.  I think there are a lot of things which I would encourage people to think about and to be optimistic about this technology and what it can offer.  FLATOW: What effect - and has the South Korean scandal had a lasting effect on the whole cloning issue?  Dr. WILMUT: Yes, it has. You would understand it if women were rather more cautious about offering to donate blastocysts for research and under these circumstances. And clearly, we'll have to be very careful to restore confidence in this.  I think you also have to feel sorry for patients, potential patients in Korea, who were promised treatments by Dr. Hwang and his colleagues. So it was a very sad event.  FLATOW: You - I mentioned at the beginning in the introduction that you believe in human cloning to a limited extent. Just define for us.  Dr. WILMUT: I think you have to ask very carefully what it is that you have in mind. The application that I've never supported is the idea of producing somebody who is a genetically identical twin of a person who is here. But I think it - to me, it would be acceptable to produce embryos from which you could get cells and to produce a baby in which you had corrected a genetic disease.  But it would not be a clone of somebody who was here already. It would be, if you like, a clone of an embryo. And it's being done for a different purpose. So it's very important all the time to say exactly what you have in mind.

And that's the reason why, to me, it's an acceptable thing to do.  FLATOW: Scott(ph) in Jackson, Michigan. Hi, welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY.  SCOTT (Caller): Hi. Um, the comment I'd like to make is that I think this cloning issue represents the same problem that you see in botany today, where by genetically engineering animals, you get the same problem you have with the plants. That you can introduce genetic material into a living organism which still has the capability of reproducing itself in the traditional way.  So just as you have, say, genetically engineered corn, cross-pollinating, you know, traditional corn, you know, and thereby, you know, polluting that corn with, say, genetic material from a shrimp, say, you could create a sheep, for instance, that has a pigment gene from, oh, from a plant, for instance. And you know, okay, great, you know. We get a sheep that, you know, grows a particular new color of wool, you know. But then that sheep can still reproduce in the traditional way with other sheep.  And so, suddenly, how did this gene from, say, a maple tree or something, you know, get into, you know, the genetic code of sheep, you know? So I think that that's - I think something that should be considered, that this genetic engineering of animals, you know, is the same - you know, represents the same problem of genetic pollution essentially. That, you know, you're going to get -it's a way for genetic material to, I guess, jump across the species barrier, you know?  FLATOW: Yeah, that's interesting. Let Dr. Wilmut answer that.  Dr. WILMUT: Yeah, let me make a couple of points. It is actually easier to identify and recover animals which have been genetically modified, if you really want to, than it is to go fetch back all of the maize plants that are scattered around the Midwest. It is a totally different of magnitude, as it's quite feasible.  But let me also suggest to you that people wouldn't actually be interested in that sort of comparatively trivial approach. Let's consider instead that it is possible to change cows so that they could not be susceptible to Mad Cow Disease. It may be possible to change cows so that they would be resistant to foot and mouth disease. Now, I would suggest to you that those are two objectives which it is well worth considering not only for the benefits of the people who may ultimately consume milk and meat from them, but also for the animals themselves.  FLATOW: All right. Thanks for calling, Scott.  SCOTT: Thanks.  FLATOW: Well, what about creating animals that grow our body parts? Hearts and things like that?  Dr. WILMUT: Yeah. One project, which a couple of groups certainly are still pursuing intensively, is the idea of changing pigs so that their organs can be used in people. And there is at least a handful of papers now showing that by making a particular genetic change, the organs are able to cope with blood from primates, not from human beings, but much better than anything in the past.  I think it's still some way away. There are a lot of challenges still to overcome, but it is something that people are still considering.  FLATOW: Could you change enough genes so that you're actually making a human heart inside the pig?  Dr. WILMUT: I think probably not. The logistics of that would be very difficult. But whether we can change enough pig genes to make it acceptable, I think that isn't clear either, because we don't understand the problem enough yet.  FLATOW: And then we talk about the problem of bringing other viruses and things (unintelligible).  Dr. WILMUT: Of course. That is the major issue, there would be a risk. And, of course, the context is different. Not - because what could happen in saving the life of one person is that you could put the entire human community at risk. And so the risk-benefit analysis is very different from when you're considering treatment of a particular person.  FLATOW: Is it Chi Chi(ph), in Portland? Hi there.  CHI CHI (Caller): Hi. I've got a quick question. Much less controversial. When do you think it'll be affordable, meaning, say, under $10,000, to clone a dog?  Dr. WILMUT: It's very difficult to know all of these things, I'm afraid. With the present technologies, as you know, the efficiency is very low and the cost very high. What we need for many of these applications is another jump in efficiency, which is comparable to that which enabled us to produce Dolly. Whether it will come from one more big step or from lots of little ones which will accumulate, it's impossible to know. And who knows what it will be or when it will come. I'm sorry not to be clearer than that.  FLATOW: Phil(ph) in Syracuse. Hi and welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY.  PHIL (Caller): Yes, hi there. Let's see. I have a question about human cloning to produce a human being. And I guess my question is, why is that considered bad, unethical? It seems the politically correct thing to say nowadays is to say you're against human cloning for that.  FLATOW: So you could bring back your bother if he had died early, or a relative, somebody like that?  PHIL: Or anything like that. And, in fact, there are millions of clones out there today, and they're called identical twins. And I'm thinking, this - why not people who might want to have a clone of themselves. It'd be interesting I think for psychology to see how this person - identical twin who's maybe 20 or 30 years difference in age turns out. And so I'd like to ask your guest what is so ethically wrong with that? I see nothing wrong with it myself.  Dr. WILMUT: I think the fundamental difference you've already identified is that the twins would be of a different age. The two who are the same age actually I think do face some pressures as it is, because they're expected to be the same. And if they are the same age. . .  PHIL: But what's wrong with that, though?  Dr. WILMUT: And if they are the same age the consequences are not too great. But if they are different, I think it's imposing an expectation on the younger child.  PHIL: Parents (unintelligible) have expectations (unintelligible).  FLATOW: Well, what if you had a newborn and you just started the cloning right there and gave a twin immediately.  Dr. WILMUT: I mean, there the difference would be less. But I think you're right that parents do impose expectations. There will be many people listening to this who could tell you that that's deeply to be regretted and we should do everything we can to avoid amplifying those pressures. That's the reason why I don't like the idea.  FLATOW: All right, thanks for calling.  PHIL: You're welcome.  FLATOW: You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY, from NPR News. I'm Ira Flatow talking with William - with William! - Ian Wilmut, who's author of After Dolly: The Uses and Misuses Human Cloning. It's getting late. I'm not speaking well anymore. Co-author with Roger Highfield. Our number, 1-800-989-8255.  Despite the U. K. support for stem cell research, that's not true throughout the European Union. And we mentioned - why is there such a difference between the Union's, the countries?  Dr. WILMUT: Well, I think the history is very different. If you pick out, for example, Germany, which has a very strong conservative group who oppose this, Catholic countries like Italy and Spain who oppose for different reasons, I think it just simply reflects the history. And I believe it's possible that over a period of time, a few decades, that these differences will become less and it will become possible to have a consistent legislation across all the countries.  FLATOW: You'd think the EU might want a David Beckham or a Wayne Rooney or somebody like that.  Dr. WILMUT: Oh, probably not. We might like some resilience I think. It's the other way around, yeah.  (Soundbite of laughter)  FLATOW: World Cup, we're speaking World Cup talk in case - Americans audiences don't know what you're talking about.  Dr. WILMUT: No, I understand, I understand.  FLATOW: We lost yesterday, so that's another story.  Dr. WILMUT: Yes, I saw that too, yes.  FLATOW: So where do you think the future is? Give me some steps to the future as you might map it out.  Dr. WILMUT: Well, I think that it would be really good to be able to increase the efficiency, to understand why the nuclear reprogram doesn't work more accurately. And that would then facilitate everything that we do.  But I think a fairly nearby - near thing is to be able to produce cells which have the characteristics of a patient with ALS, for example, which is a disease mentioned earlier in your program, which is a relentlessly progressive disease, which means people lose control of their limbs and ultimately die because they stop breathing. A very sad situation. It isn't understood.  Now, one problem is that the nerves which are affected are deep inside the body, so the researchers can't get access to them to study them. If we produce cells from cloned embryos from a person who had inherited the disease, it would be possible for the first time to study those cells as they begin to change for the very first time, to understand it and hopefully to develop a high throughput drug screening system which would enable us to assess thousands of drugs and hopefully identify something which could stabilize the position of patients. I think that's - it would be five, ten, fifteen years before that program would be completed. Probably ten years before it would be completed. But I think there is a realistic hope that that would bring forward the first drug to be able to stabilize the position of patients. And just imagine what that would mean to somebody.  FLATOW: Yeah. I also think once you get a breakthrough on one of these things, the opposition melts away.  Dr. WILMUT: I believe that. And we haven't got time before the end of your program to list the number of diseases which could be studied in that way. I mean they vary from some causes of sudden death because of heart failure, cancer, psychiatric disease, other neurodegenerative disease. There's a huge range of inherited diseases that we don't understand and for which there isn't a treatment.  FLATOW: Yeah, because we've already seen in this country opposition by some very conservative members of Congress. . .  Dr. WILMUT: Yes.  FLATOW: . . . evaporating because they have relatives who suffer from some of these diseases.  Dr. WILMUT: Yes. Yes. And, you know, among your audience, there will be many people who already have one of these conditions or will have a family member or a work colleague who has these conditions. And because we're living longer we have more chance of succumbing to them and suffering that fate ourselves.  FLATOW: And once somebody shows the first pathway that it can happen, then others will want to jump in and they'll say why did you leave us out?  Dr. WILMUT: Yep. Yep. I believe this is true. I mean, I do respect the opinions of other people, of course. It's their right to have different views. But I think you're absolutely right. It will be come acceptable.  FLATOW: So where do you go from here, now?  Dr. WILMUT: Well, the other thing that we would like to do is to understand cloning, because there's another thing which I believe ultimately will be the greatest inheritance of the Dolly experiment, which is by understanding cloning I think we may be able to change cells of one type, somebody mentioned corpus cells earlier on, into another type, without making an embryo. And that would facilitate the idea of patient-specific cells.  And I think it's in that sort of way that by making biologists think differently the Dolly experiment has been most important of all.  FLATOW: You'd do away with the ethical problem.  Dr. WILMUT: Yes.  FLATOW: Yeah. Good luck to you.  Dr. WILMUT: Thank you.  FLATOW: And thank you for taking time to be with us. Dr. Ian Wilmut, professor of reproductive science at the University of Edinburgh, and co-author with Roger Highfield of After Dolly: The Uses and Misuses of Human Cloning. A very interesting book. I highly recommend it. ", "section": "Science", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2006 NPR.  All rights reserved.

But there be - forgive me - there may be nothing more valuable to put in a vault than seeds for the crops that feed humanity. This week the government of Norway started building an underground vault that will hold millions of seeds, the most complete collection in the world. Construction is underway on the remote territory of Svalbard, close to the North Pole. For one American this vault is the culmination of a lifelong and controversial campaign. Dan Charles reports. DAN CHARLES: The ceremony launching the seed vault was a thoroughly Nordic affair. The wind numbed your fingers. Behind Norway's Prime Minister you could see snow covered mountains. Then a lean sandy-haired man in his mid-50s stepped to the microphone and the soft accent of western Tennessee echoed across the rocky mountainside. CARY FOWLER: I suppose the time comes in everyone's life, and indeed in the life of government, when we ask what is our legacy going to be? CHARLES: The seed vault is at least partly the legacy of this man, Cary Fowler, executive director of the Global Crop Diversity Trust, based in Rome. Thirty years ago, Fowler was just out of college. The son of a Tennessee judge and grandson of a farmer, he became fascinating by the price of agricultural progress. Farmers around the world were abandoning traditional kinds of rice, wheat and corn, instead planting the products of modern science, new seeds that produced bigger harvests. FOWLER: If you're driving in the countryside and you see millions of individual plants of wheat out there, you don't think that wheat is going to become extinct anytime soon. CHARLES: But Fowler points out all those plants are genetically identical. And being identical, they are identically vulnerable, whether to disease, drought, or insects. He dug deeper and discovered that the genetic diversity that use to exist in fields now can only be found in refrigerated rooms called gene banks. There's one, for instance, outside Mexico City at CIMMYT, the International Center for Improvement of Wheat and Maize, which is another word for corn. THOMAS PAYNE: Okay. We're going to go into the CIMMYT gene bank right now, the gene bank vault. We have to go through a number of doors here with secret codes. CHARLES: Thomas Payne is one of CIMMYT's senior gene bankers. He enters an underground vault, chilled to zero-degrees Fahrenheit. It's filled with shelves holding jars and bags of seeds. PAYNE: This room contains over a hundred thousand different wheat varieties, and about 30,000 different maize varieties. The maize varieties come from here in Mexico and Central America. CHARLES: Many of the wheat seeds come from the Fertile Crescent, where farmers first grew wheat in present day Iraq, Iran and Turkey. In CIMMYT's greenhouse, the full diversity of this collection is on display. PAYNE: There's wheats that are as tall as I am. I'm six feet-four inches tall. There are wheats that are short. There are wheats that have dark colored stems, light colored heads, light colored stems. CHARLES: What you can't see is more important: genes the plant breeders can use to create new, better plant varieties. Cary Fowler ended up devoting his life to preserving this genetic diversity and free access to it. And even though he's a polite and mild-mannered fellow, that put him right in the middle of some angry international arguments. In the beginning, as an activist at the Rural Advancement Fund in North Carolina, he attacked American seed companies. They were pushing hard for patents on seeds and plant varieties. That amounted to genetic imperialism, Fowler argued. The companies were claiming genetic treasure, trying to profit from plants that farmers in Asia and Latin America developed over many generations. But Fowler didn't foresee where that argument would lead. In the 1980s, many Third World governments adopted genetic protectionism. They said, unless they were paid they'd share none of their seeds and plants. Here's Ethiopian official, Tuwol Debearhan(ph) making the case a few years ago. TUWOL DEBEARHAN: The industrialized countries want to take genetic resources and patent them. We want something out of those resources. CHARLES: Fowler was appalled. FOWLER: That is dangerous. That's really dangerous, to take a resource like this and restrict its use. I think immoral. CHARLES: So Fowler's second battle started with Third World governments. He recalls one particularly blunt conversation with the minister of agricultural from one African country. This was during the mid-1990s, when Fowler was working for the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization. FOWLER: He said, oh, I just want to tell you that my country has hundreds of millions of dollars worth of genetic resources. I said, do you want my advice about what to do with them? He said, well, yes. I said, good, sell them. CHARLES: Fowler was being ironic. The fact is, he told the minister, no one's going to pay for access to your small piece of the gene pool. You'll just hurt yourself, cutting your own farmers off from other gene banks. Fowler had moved to Norway by this time, where he's a university professor. He also had transformed himself from activist to insider from critic to deal broker. And the third act of his personal drama became working out a cease-fire in the seed battles that he'd help instigate in the first place. Just last week in Madrid, negotiators sealed a deal. From now on Third World governments will share most of their seeds freely and companies that use them will pay royalties into an international fund for gene banks. It was a personal triumph for Cary Fowler and so was the groundbreaking ceremony two days later for the Svalbard seed vault. FOWLER: A facility inside a mountain near the North Pole where the most valuable natural resource on Earth can be securely conserved. This is really a wonderful day. CHARLES: Fifteen years ago, Fowler opposed a similar proposal to build a big seed vault here. It looked too much like a gene grab by rich countries, he thought. It's different today, he says. The seeds in this vault will be a heritage for all to share. For NPR News, this is Dan Charles. SCOTT SIMON, Host:  Vaults are most often the repositories of money, legal documents, personal effects.

I'm Neal Conan in Washington. Deceit appears to have been part of human consciousness since before Cain professed ignorance of Abel's whereabouts, and society struggles to figure out who's telling the truth and who isn't. The 20th century introduced the polygraph test, which doesn't test truth but the sweat and stress associated with telling a lie. Even its staunchest defenders concede it's not always accurate. The test alone can make some people nervous enough to skew the results, while some others can lie without stress. Now there's a promising new test that measures not anxiety, but the lie itself. It's based on brain scans produced by MRI - Magnetic Resonance Imaging - and this technology isn't down the road someday, it makes its commercial debut next month. It raises issues about accuracy and fairness, about the nature of deception, and our goals in uncovering it. Put simply, can we handle the truth? Later in the program, we admit it. We'd probably not be able to take a polygraph and swear that we never taped Dynasty or 90210 at least once in our lives. We'll talk about the death of Aaron Spelling and the rise of jiggle TV. But first, building a better lie detector. If you have questions about how the technology works, what it measures, and how it might be used, give us a call. Our number here in Washington is 800-989-8255. That's 800-989-TALK. E-mail is talk@NPR. org. Daniel Langleben - Glang - excuse me, Langleben is a pioneer in the lie detection field. He's an assistant professor of psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania, and he joins us from the studios of the Wharton School on that campus. And I apologize for mangling your name, sir. Professor DANIEL LANGLEBEN (Professor of Psychiatry, University of Pennsylvania): Good afternoon. CONAN: Good afternoon. Does this technology work? Prof. LANGLEBEN: Well, it depends what you mean by work. This technology could differentiate - distinguish a lie and truth under controlled conditions in the laboratory. Between that and commercial applications or any other clinical applications that you mentioned, there is some experimentation to do. But the existing body of work demonstrates that, under some conditions, it could work. CONAN: It could work. Now, as I understand it, you started out studying ADHD, you know, attention deficit disorder. How did you get into the search for a better lie detector? Prof. LANGLEBEN: Well, I actually encountered some anecdotal and published reports on the specific characteristics of children with ADHD vis-\u00e0-vis deception. That is there was a suggestion that children with ADHD are worse or less successful liars than other children. CONAN: Mm-hmm. Prof. LANGLEBEN: And we also know that one of the key deficiencies in ADHD is a poor response inhibition, a poor ability to control their behavior. And so if you put those two things together, you could make up a hypothesis that deception requires response inhibition. Since functional MRI is one of the premier tools for studying - for correlating brain and behavior. . . CONAN: Mm-hmm. Prof. LANGLEBEN: . . . this would be a tool of choice to test this hypothesis, that is that deception requires response inhibition, and that was our first work. CONAN: What does it look like when you actually see the picture? Prof. LANGLEBEN: Well, it looks like - first of all, what you're looking at are two things. Images that you're getting while the MRI scan is running. . . CONAN: Mm-hmm. Prof. LANGLEBEN: . . . are not the images that you actually use to distinguish between lie and truth. What you look at is the statistical maps of the differences between two types of responses. For example, a response to question A and question B. And that is what we're using to discriminate between lie and truth. CONAN: I see, so I. . . Prof. LANGLEBEN: All right, when you. . . CONAN: You might ask, for example, is your name Daniel, and you would give a response. Prof. LANGLEBEN: Yes. CONAN: And then the next question is, is your name Fred, and we'd take a look at the difference between the two. Prof. LANGLEBEN: Correct. And what you will see is increased - a relative increase in activity in some parts of the brain during particular type of questions. And then what you need to do is establish the pattern, knowing what is true and what is not true, try and correlate between a pattern that is the typical of truth and a pattern typical of lie. And then you will want to extrapolate it to the next group of people or subjects of patients that you will study to see whether their responses fit into that pattern that you just established. CONAN: And that sounds, to me, at least at this point, is it capable of distinguishing, you know, shades of gray? Or is it. . . Prof. LANGLEBEN: Well, no. This is what the paradigm or the format in which you ask the questions is for. CONAN: Aha. Prof. LANGLEBEN: To remove the shades of gray. And this technique is used with polygraph as well. CONAN: They're all yes or no questions. Or black-and-white questions, yeah. Prof. LANGLEBEN: Yes and no or relative - or questions with a limited number of possible answers. And I wouldn't be surprised if, with some sophistication, it can increase the number of possible answers to three, four, five, six, as long as the number is limited and the pattern is pre-established. CONAN: Mm-hmm. Let's see if we can get some listeners questions in on this, too. 800-989-8255, if you'd like to join us, 800-989-TALK. E-mail is talk@npr. org. Steve, Steve's calling from Tulsa, Oklahoma. STEVE (Caller): Yeah, I have a couple of questions, and I'll get my - listen to the response off the air, or off the phone. One thing that I have a question about is how do they - let's say someone is - to clear themselves of crime are required to take a - this new form of lie detector, we'll call it, how do they get around the HIPAA violation or HIPAA rules as far as medical information being released? And secondly, isn't the MRI interpretation as good as the interpreter, and wouldn't that hold a lot of challenges when court actions occur? CONAN: Well, Daniel, I think you're certainly competent to answer the second part of that question. Prof. LANGLEBEN: Well, both of those are excellent questions. Question number one about HIPAA: here, you need to decide whether we're talking about research or we're talking about a diagnostic procedure that falls in this realm of medicine or you're talking about non-medical use of a technology, and depending on that, HIPAA will or will not apply. And also it, of course, raises the issue of whether you want or can do this sort of testing in individuals who are not interested in cooperating with you. CONAN: Mm-hmm. Prof. LANGLEBEN: And I'll proceed to the second question. CONAN: Go ahead. Prof. LANGLEBEN: Can you repeat, by the way, that question to me? I think I lost that one. CONAN: It was basically, I think, doesn't the quality of the test depend on the quality of the person who's interpreting the MRI? Prof. LANGLEBEN: Right. Well, here is one area where MRI is - I expect MRI to have a significant advantage over at least the current state of interpretation of polygraph data, because MRI data is essentially analyzed and interpreted almost automatically. The only thing that is happening by hand is presetting of the thresholds of what's significant and what's not. So the analysis and interpretation of MRI data is very much a procedure that follows a set algorithm that has very little human intervention. CONAN: While the polygraph has a considerable human factor in it. Prof. LANGLEBEN: Correct. CONAN: Yes. Prof. LANGLEBEN: But it doesn't mean that polygraph cannot be made into much more algorithm-like process if somebody was interested in doing that. CONAN: Would there be any benefit - just to follow up just a moment on Steve's thoughts - would be there be any benefit to incorporate, to use both of these simultaneously, since the kinds of questions are not too dissimilar? Prof. LANGLEBEN: Absolutely. And this actually - if I can guess and imagine the future, this is what is most likely to happen, because we're talking about two measurements of different parts of the system, which is a human being. And while the polygraph is measuring essentially one channel of data, that is - or several channels of data coming from the activity of the peripheral nervous system, which is heart rates, skin conductants, et cetera. While the FMRI's looking at brain activity, which has many more dimensions in a way, but it is a different spot to look at the activity of the human organism. So a combination of the two is much more - is likely to create superior accuracy. And more than that, the polygraph could serve essentially as a screening test for the more specific test of a functional MRI. CONAN: Okay. Steve, thanks very much for the call. STEVE: You're welcome. CONAN: All right. The University of Pennsylvania is a hot bed for the development of lie detection technology, therefore, a hot bed of debate over its policy, its ethics, and its social implications. Paul Root Wolpe is a Senior Fellow at Penn's Center for Bioethics. He tracks development of lie detection technology. He's also on the board of the Neuroethics Society. And he's with us also from the Wharton School studios on the Penn campus, sitting right next to his colleague there. Nice to have you on the program today. Prof. PAUL WOLPE (Senior Fellow, University of Pennsylvania's Center for Bioethics): Pleasure to be here. CONAN: First Paul Root Wolpe, there have to be concerns about this. There are many concerns about this. And one of the fortunate things is that many of these scientists who are actually developing this are thoughtful about it and share many of these concerns. And there are two kinds of concerns. There are concerns about the efficacy of the test itself and whether it works the way it's advertised and in whose hands it will work appropriately. And the second set of issues are what kind of a truthful society do we want, and under what circumstances do we want to use an accurate lie detector? And who gets to use it and who shouldn't be using it? And do we really want a society where even telling the kinds of social truths that many societies are based on -Asian society, for example, is actually constructed - many Asian societies - on a set of social lie-telling rituals. So lies have an important place in society. There are some kinds of lies that all of us tell, and some kinds of lies that we wouldn't - you know, is that a beautiful baby, isn't my baby beautiful - those are the kinds of lies we all think are appropriate. CONAN: Do I look fat in this? Yes. (Soundbite of laughter) Prof. WOLPE: Right. So there is a real debate that has to happen over who should have access to the technology and under what circumstances. CONAN: Because it becomes clear, reading about this technology - and Dr. Langleben you can help us out here - it's coming, if it's not here yet, and there is a commercial version of this that makes its debut next month, whether that's good or not. This is happening. It's down the road. Prof. LANGLEBEN: Right. And it's just beginning now. And as we move through the next years and decades, this technology is going to get more robust and more accurate. And that's why now is the time to begin this conversation. CONAN: All right. If you'd like to join the conversation give us a phone call. Our number is 800-989-8255, that's 800-989-TALK. The e-mail address is talk@npr. org. We're talking about lies and new technology to detect them. I'm Neal Conan. We'll be back after a short break. This is TALK OF THE NATION, from NPR News. (Soundbite of music) CONAN: This is TALK OF THE NATION. I'm Neal Conan in Washington. We're talking today about building a better lie detector. New technology uses brain scans and promises greater accuracy. It also raises questions of ethics, privacy, and consent. Our guests are Daniel Langleben, who's an assistant professor of psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania. And Paul Root Wolpe, a senior fellow at Penn's Center for Bioethics. Of course, you're invited to join us. 800-989-8255, 800-989-TALK. E-mail is talk@npr. org. And let's talk with Greg. Greg's calling from Provo in Utah. GREG (CALLER): Hi, I do criminal defense work. I'm an attorney that represents a lot of criminals and I've met some pretty good liars, I think, in my time. Some that are pathological. They can tell the same story over and over again, and I think actually believe it when everyone else in the world is saying something different. And would their brain scans necessarily show that they were lying or are they - are their brains wired differently such that they can tell the story over and over again and convince themselves that it's the truth? CONAN: Daniel Langleben? Prof. LANGLEBEN: Well, again, this is an excellent question. And the answer is double here. First of all, theoretically, fMRI is much more likely to uncover a deception in an individual who does not have an emotional response to his or her behavior, which is a psychopath, because our tests were specifically designed to avoid provoking any excessive emotion or any emotion at all. CONAN: Mm-hmm. Prof. LANGLEBEN: While polygraph is essentially based on an anxiety related response and if such response is blunted, such as you would expect in a person with an anti-social personality disorder, what you call a psychopath, you are very likely to have a false negative finding. In fact, I think there are programs of training for polygraph evasion that teach people to do that. I would expect that it would be much more difficult to do with your own brain activity, though, even that may not be impossible. I can imagine some system of biofeedback that could allow you to manipulate your own brain output, but that would be many steps away from what's available now. CONAN: Hmm. So, in other words, there's promise that - you're saying it would be much more accurate than polygraph. Prof. LANGLEBEN: That it would be much more valuable in this particular type of populations which are the prime sort of target of lie detection. CONAN: Good liars? Good liars is who we're after here. Prof. LANGLEBEN: So this would be an example of what I was suggesting as a potential combination of the use of polygraph and fMRI. That is an individual who cannot be tested with a polygraph successfully may be tested with a functional MRI. However, there is a sort of - the point is that this needs to be experimentally tested. CONAN: Mm-hmm. Prof. LANGLEBEN: This is, like I said, a theoretical prediction. And until it has been tested under controlled experimental conditions, in peer reviewed, academic-based work, you cannot really say that that's true. You can say that this is what you expect to be true. Prof. WOLPE: And, Neal, I think this is one of the big issues that we're dealing with right now. We have two companies out there who are planning, in the fairly near future, on bringing brain imaging lie-detection technology to market. Many of these questions, pathological liars, people with personality disorders, have - these questions have not yet been tested empirically. We don't know how people with different kinds of personalities, in different kinds of situations, are going to look when the fMRI technology is used on them. It hasn't been tested robustly with very different populations, with different ethnic populations in a robust way. And so my big concern about this technology is the prematurely of bringing it to market at this time; I don't think it's ready for primetime yet, and it's of great concern that there's a race now to bring this technology to market. CONAN: Hmm. GREG: Somebody with mental disease, though, is going to - their brain's going to be much different than a normal brain regardless of what test is being done though, correct? Prof. LANGLEBEN: I would expect so, and, again, it would be a speculation. I just submitted a paper for publication exactly on this topic. And, unfortunately, there isn't experimental data on the subject and it needs to be done. CONAN: Mm-hmm. Greg, thanks very much for the call. GREG: Thank you. CONAN: And let's go to Ray(ph). And Ray's calling from San Francisco. RAY (CALLER): You know, most of us, at one time or another have harbored an idea or concealed a notion of some kind or other consciously and maybe the interviewers who were trained to use the new system of lie-detection could tease out or try to tease out our concealed information or deceits or conspiracies. But, you know, all these things are on a continuum and when you think of it, most of us carry around notions of dubious - of factuality, factoids, PR hype, and various kinds of news spin and so on are in our consciousness at various times, so that must also be evaluated by an interviewer. So how do you distinguish between the (unintelligible). CONAN: Presumably, Ray, you ask a specific question. Like, you know, where were you on Thursday at 9:00? And you're not going to say, you know - you're answer's not going to be conditioned by what you saw earlier that day on CNN or Fox, so. . . Prof. WOLPE: You have to understand that lie detectors do not determine truth. The best lie detectors can do is determine what you think is true. And so a skilled person using this understands that what you are saying is simply what is true for you. And once you have that, then you have to begin to evaluate the information for whatever purpose you want to use it for. RAY: Right. So what you're saying then is that an interviewer is going to look to infer some dissonance and that may not even be that the person being interviewed is aware of it. CONAN: Hmm. Would that be accurate, Mr. Langleben? Prof. LANGLEBEN: I'm sorry, can you repeat that? CONAN: Ray's point is that there could be truths teased out that even the subject is not aware of that they are being exposed. Prof. LANGLEBEN: Well, that would fall under a very different category and we could not even call it lie detection. If you want to describe it in some way, you would call it mind reading; essentially, trying to test what is stored in your memory without you even trying to shape it or deliver it to you, which is very different from lie-detection and it's a different line of research. Is it possible? It may be possible and it's even more fraught with potential dangers and problems and misinterpretation than lie-detection. RAY: Well, do you find that verges on the area that the MRI will read? Prof. LANGLEBEN: Again, it's completely outside of the scope of lie detection, but there are actually - there are a large number of researchers doing fMRI research related to this topic, essentially trying to correlate content of your memory with some kind of MRI pattern. And that includes false memory. RAY: Maybe you're familiar with the story entitled The Demolished Man by Alfred Bestor, an advertising writer and science fiction author, who proposed a system for interfering with mind readers. CONAN: Well, it was a science fiction novel with which I don't think they're familiar, because it's pretty obscure, but I'm familiar with it. And it was a (unintelligible) device, a tune that he hummed to avoid the mind readers. But Ray, thanks very much. We'll move right along with that. RAY: Thank you. CONAN: Anyway, let's see if we can get another question on the line. Jim. Jim's calling from Green Bay in Wisconsin. JIM (CALLER): Good afternoon. CONAN: It's a great book, by the way. If you find it, go read it. But it doesn't relate much to this. Go ahead. JIM: Not allowing the technology to go ahead is infringing on the right of the innocent. If I were going to spend 20 years in prison for something I didn't do, I sure in heck wish I had the right to go take a polygraph, sodium pentothal, or anything that's available at the time to prove my innocence and I would wish it would be put in the court of law. CONAN: Yeah, Paul Root Wolpe, that's the question that's been raised in this context, too. Prof. WOLPE: Very much so. And the thing is that in order for that to be valuable, you have to have confidence that your technology works and works well. There are certainly very valuable uses of a reliable lie detector. Proving innocence is one of them and that's one of the reasons why both of these companies that are pursuing this technology now say that they're main goal will be to use this with people who are innocent and trying to prove their innocence. The question here is not should we use this for those purposes. The question here is, what other purposes should we use this for? If my daught - if I find a dent in my car and my daughter says it's not her, do I have a right to grab her wrists and pull her over to the local lie-detection, you know, company and say I want to know if she was really out past curfew and dented the car? If I want to hire someone to be my bank teller, does bank management have the right to use this technology to screen its employees? Is the military going to start using this technology? Are they going to fly it down to Guantanamo Bay? These are the questions that I think we need to begin to discuss now. Where is it appropriate to use this and under what circumstances? Assuming that it works properly and well. CONAN: Daniel Langleben, as I understand it, the military helped fund your research, and I would assume that they are interested in it. Not necessarily the products that are coming out next month, though. Prof. LANGLEBEN: They have funded the work that has been done so for, though to a very limited extent, I would say. And they - I think their interest was mainly in trying to demonstrate - to test whether there is a feasibility of using this technology. And that we've done. And at this point we do not have further plans for military funding. CONAN: Let's get Jack on the line. Jack is calling from Petaluma in California. JACK (CALLER): Yes. I was in the Navy in 1948. A Naval Officer going to school at Treasure Island. Something was stolen from a roommate of mine who was just a temporary roommate and I was called over to take a lie detector test. The military was using it back then. I refused it and walked out of the place. Nothing was ever done about it, but it was a pretty chilling thing. I knew that I hadn't stolen the man's wristwatch and I would never take it again unless they hogtied me to the place. And I don't - the other gentleman said he might take it to prove his innocence. I think he would be crazy to do that, since it's admittedly not a 100 percent accurate. CONAN: Mm-hmm. JACK: That's all I have to say on that. CONAN: All right. And thanks for the call. Paul Root Wolpe, I guess that's where you get onto questions of coercion. Well, you don't have to take it. Of course, if you don't. . . Prof. WOLPE: Right, and that's the issue. With this technology, by the way, with the fMRI lie-detection technology you can't force someone to take this. If they really don't want to cooperate, it's very difficult to get the kinds of readings that you want and to get their - you must have their cooperation. So, in that sense, it's difficult to use this coercively. But, as the caller just mentioned, there are other kinds of coercion. There's expectation. There's assumption of falsehood when someone refuses to use these technologies. And those kinds of coercive forces can be just as destructive and just as problematic. CONAN: And we should point out, currently, and it's the only law that we know about, there's now law for this new technology, but for polygraph, it's not admissible in court, it can't be used by companies, but all levels of government can use it to screen employees, including the military. Prof. WOLPE: That's right. CONAN: We're talking with Paul Root Wolpe, a senior fellow at Penn's Center for Bioethics, and with Daniel Langleben, who's an assistant professor of psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania, about a better lie detector. And you're listening to TALK OF THE NATION, from NPR News. And, Daniel Langleben, as you describe this technology, it does look like it has tremendous promise for your field, for psychiatry. Prof. LANGLEBEN: That's correct. And my interest in this technology is, I would say, largely guided by that. Because, one of the callers for example, described the concern about interfering with one's memories, which is not exactly lie-detection, but related. Well, same technology can be applied to treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder. In the same way, lie-detection opens the door to a better understanding of unconscious defense mechanisms, one of which is denial. So, in a way, it could open the door to the, how would I say, restoration of the biological basis of psychotherapy, which is a method that has been pretty much on the back burner of modern psychiatry. CONAN: Mm-hmm. Let's see if we can get another caller on the line. This is Matt. Matt's with us from St. Louis. MATT (CALLER): Yes. Good afternoon. Actually, I have two questions for both your guests. Specifically, which region of the brain is the fMRI focused on that's determining if it's a truth or a lie? Is it a conscious part of the brain or is unconscious? Can you convince yourself that a lie is actually truth over some type of conditioning? CONAN: And is it one section or several? Daniel Langleben. Prof. LANGLEBEN: Well, I'll be grossly oversimplifying, so please forgive me. But what we see is a pattern that looks like what you need to activate if you want to control your behavior. As we originally hypothesized, the activity looks very similar to what you would need to activate in your brain to suppress a response of some sort. CONAN: Mm-hmm. Prof. LANGLEBEN: Now, this pattern will change depending on the particular nature and the order of the questions asked, and therefore each change in the pattern of the test would need to be validated and tested and verified. But if I have to answer it in a simple way: it is conscious and it's not just one part of the brain, it's a number of parts of the brain that work together. CONAN: All right Matt, your other point? MATT: Yeah, my other question was, and some other disorders have been mentioned, but has multiple personality been taken into account to see if that actually has different truth percentiles, I guess, depending on the personality that the person assumes? Prof. LANGLEBEN: Well, we don't even know whether this technique will work in criminals, to say nothing about multiple personality disorder, which is an extremely rare condition. CONAN: Mm-hmm. Ah. . . Prof. LANGLEBEN: However. . . CONAN: Go ahead, I'm sorry. Prof. LANGLEBEN: I would expect that people who - as Dr. Wolpe said before, we're talking about you're subjective truth. And in multiple personality disorder, it's going to be pretty hard to find the subjective truth. CONAN: Matt, thank you. MATT: Well, thank you. CONAN: Thanks very much for the call. And again getting back to what Professor Wolpe was talking about earlier, there are obviously degrees of untruths, everything from a bluff in a poker game to the social white lie to, you know, trying to get away with murder. Does the technology, at least as far as you've tested it, does it pick up all those differences? Prof. WOLPE: This is Paul Wolpe. CONAN: Go ahead. Prof. WOLPE: The technology of fMRI looks at the response to a question that is asked. The technique or technology of asking these questions is really no different or little different in the fMRI as it is in polygraph. And for over 80 years, polygraph professionals have tried to perfect a technique whereby these kinds of - any kind of issue or question can be broken down into binary or forced choice answers. So even if we're talking about something that has shades of truth, you try to ask yes, no or at least limited answer questions that would lead you, one after another, into those shades of truth. So it's part of the artistry of formulating your questions for these types of instruments. The fMRI doesn't change the basic need to have a skilled questioner. CONAN: We'll take a couple of more questions on this when we get back from a break. I promise that's true. 800-989-8255, if you'd like to join us. 800-989-TALK. E-mail us, talk@npr. org. Plus, we'll remember TV pioneer Aaron Spelling. I'm Neal Conan. You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION, from NPR News. (Soundbite of music) CONAN: This is TALK OF THE NATION. I'm Neal Conan in Washington. And here are the headlines from some of the other stories we're following here today at NPR News. Warren Buffet has announced he will give most of his $44 billion fortune to charity. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation will be the recipient of most of Buffet's generosity, receiving about 1. 5 billion dollars per year. And Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert says he has ruled out bargaining with the captors of an Israeli soldier and has promised a broad and ongoing military offensive. The soldier was seized by Palestinian militants during a guerilla raid in southern Israel on Sunday. Details on those stories and, of course, much more later today on ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. Tomorrow on TALK OF THE NATION, with tens of thousands of people waiting for an organ donation in this country, the need continues to far outstrip the supply. Some wonder why they can't buy an organ, or sell one. Others are horrified at the prospect. The ethics of organ donation and sales, next TALK OF THE NATION, from NPR News. In a few minutes, he gave us the Love Boat, Dynasty, 90210, and redefined television drama. We'll remember Aaron Spelling with TV Guide's Matt Roush. But first, we're talking about technology to detect lies. Our guests are Daniel Langleben, an assistant professor of psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania, and Paul Root Wolpe, who's a senior fellow at Penn's Center for Bioethics. If you'd like to join us: 800-989-8255, 800-989-TALK. E-mail is talk@npr. org. And let's get a question in from Howard. Howard's with us from Cleveland. HOWARD (CALLER): Hi, Neal. Thanks for taking my call. An MRI is a pretty large and fairly expensive piece of equipment that you just can't roll into an office when you need use it. Are any of this type of technology results replicable through an EEG, which is much smaller and more portable? CONAN: Daniel Langleben? Prof. LANGLEBEN: Well, again, it's an excellent question. And, in fact, our work is based on prior work by Peter Rosenfeld from Northwestern University in Illinois with EEG. The difference between EEG and fMRI is that fMRI has many more dimensions of measuring brain activity compared to EEG, where the source of brain activity is hard to detect. So the answer is yes, it is very possible that some of the findings we have with fMRI could be repeated with EEG. However, we expect that the fMRI will remain superior. HOWARD: Just as a follow-up, would it be as easy to read as automated as the fMRI or is it more user subjective? Prof. LANGLEBEN: I would expect that interpretation of EEG data could be automated to the same extent of fMRI. HOWARD: Great, thank you very much. CONAN: Thanks, Howard. Prof. LANGLEBEN: You're welcome. CONAN: And let's see if we can talk with Jim. Jim in Oklahoma City. JIM (CALLER): Hello, guys. I was just curious, I didn't know if anyone had addressed the cost issue versus the polygraph versus an MRI. I know, like the previous caller said, you know, MRIs are cumbersome, they're not portable really and. . . CONAN: They cost millions of dollars each, yeah. JIM: Exactly. And you would have to have, you know, I don't know, you would have to have, obviously, a radiologist to read the results, interpret the results, you couldn't just do it - just anyone interpret the results. So how would - what would the cost factor be compared to just regular polygraphs? CONAN: Any idea? Prof. LANGLEBEN: Daniel Langleben. I'll try to answer this. First of all, the cost of the machine itself, the scanner, is indeed very high. However, the -what is important here is an hourly cost of using the MRI. Because once the machine is installed it's essentially pure overhead until it's being used. So what you need to think about is an hourly cost of using an fMRI machine or MRI machine versus an hour of polygraph. And I think at that point that costs start coming pretty much close together, because it's all about labor involved, more than the actual use of the scanner. There are hundreds of MRI scanners around the country, and many of them have excess capacity. That's part one. The other issue is radiologists. In fact, interpretation of this data probably could be almost entirely automated and a radiologist probably is not a required part of interpreting this data, though radiologists could be participating in it and probably could contribute. CONAN: Okay. JIM (Caller): Okay, thanks guys. CONAN: Thank you Jim. And the cost and the - as we look ahead to this, Paul Root Wolpe, I mean, clearly the costs are going to come down, the technology is going to improve, and that's really where your concerns begin. Dr. WOLPE: It is. Then we have to decide, are we going to regulate this technology and say only certain people have access to it. Is anyone going to be able to use it when we get more and more robust lie detectors? And, especially, as we go on, there may be other kinds of technologies outside of fMRI that follow on the heels of fMRI that are more portable. They're already trying things like functional near-infrared where they shine infrared light into the frontal cortex and then detect the reflection, and they can determine blood flow through that, and there's some evidence that that may be a passable lie detector. That would be extraordinarily portable and easy to use, less even, perhaps --CONAN: And consent would not be involved. People could do it without your consent. Dr. WOLPE: Well, the way it right now, you actually have to put a band across the forehead in contact with the skin, but the goal is to eventually develop one that is remote and, perhaps, even covert. And then you have the additional question, though - I emphasize, we can't do this now - but then you have the additional question of, when you walk through that airport security checkpoint, is it perfectly okay to take someone into a side room and covertly use a lie detection technology with them. These are questions that we're actually going to have to begin grappling with. CONAN: Thanks gentlemen, both, very much for your time; we appreciate it. Dr. WOLPE: My pleasure. Dr. LANGLEBEN: Thank you very much. CONAN: We heard from Paul Root Wolpe who's a senior fellow at the University of Pennsylvania Center for Bioethics at the Department of Psychiatry, and from Daniel Langleben who's an assistant professor of psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania, all about the prospect of a better lie detector. When we come back, Aaron Spelling.  NEAL CONAN, host:  This is TALK OF THE NATION. I'm Neal Conan in Washington. Deceit appears to have been part of human consciousness since before Cain professed ignorance of Abel's whereabouts, and society struggles to figure out who's telling the truth and who isn't.  The 20th century introduced the polygraph test, which doesn't test truth but the sweat and stress associated with telling a lie. Even its staunchest defenders concede it's not always accurate. The test alone can make some people nervous enough to skew the results, while some others can lie without stress.  Now there's a promising new test that measures not anxiety, but the lie itself. It's based on brain scans produced by MRI - Magnetic Resonance Imaging - and this technology isn't down the road someday, it makes its commercial debut next month. It raises issues about accuracy and fairness, about the nature of deception, and our goals in uncovering it. Put simply, can we handle the truth?  Later in the program, we admit it. We'd probably not be able to take a polygraph and swear that we never taped Dynasty or 90210 at least once in our lives. We'll talk about the death of Aaron Spelling and the rise of jiggle TV.  But first, building a better lie detector. If you have questions about how the technology works, what it measures, and how it might be used, give us a call. Our number here in Washington is 800-989-8255. That's 800-989-TALK. E-mail is talk@NPR. org.  Daniel Langleben - Glang - excuse me, Langleben is a pioneer in the lie detection field. He's an assistant professor of psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania, and he joins us from the studios of the Wharton School on that campus. And I apologize for mangling your name, sir.  Professor DANIEL LANGLEBEN (Professor of Psychiatry, University of Pennsylvania): Good afternoon.  CONAN: Good afternoon. Does this technology work?  Prof. LANGLEBEN: Well, it depends what you mean by work. This technology could differentiate - distinguish a lie and truth under controlled conditions in the laboratory. Between that and commercial applications or any other clinical applications that you mentioned, there is some experimentation to do. But the existing body of work demonstrates that, under some conditions, it could work.  CONAN: It could work. Now, as I understand it, you started out studying ADHD, you know, attention deficit disorder. How did you get into the search for a better lie detector?  Prof. LANGLEBEN: Well, I actually encountered some anecdotal and published reports on the specific characteristics of children with ADHD vis-\u00e0-vis deception. That is there was a suggestion that children with ADHD are worse or less successful liars than other children.  CONAN: Mm-hmm.  Prof. LANGLEBEN: And we also know that one of the key deficiencies in ADHD is a poor response inhibition, a poor ability to control their behavior. And so if you put those two things together, you could make up a hypothesis that deception requires response inhibition. Since functional MRI is one of the premier tools for studying - for correlating brain and behavior. . .  CONAN: Mm-hmm.  Prof. LANGLEBEN: . . . this would be a tool of choice to test this hypothesis, that is that deception requires response inhibition, and that was our first work.  CONAN: What does it look like when you actually see the picture?  Prof. LANGLEBEN: Well, it looks like - first of all, what you're looking at are two things. Images that you're getting while the MRI scan is running. . .  CONAN: Mm-hmm.  Prof. LANGLEBEN: . . . are not the images that you actually use to distinguish between lie and truth. What you look at is the statistical maps of the differences between two types of responses. For example, a response to question A and question B. And that is what we're using to discriminate between lie and truth.  CONAN: I see, so I. . .  Prof. LANGLEBEN: All right, when you. . .  CONAN: You might ask, for example, is your name Daniel, and you would give a response.  Prof. LANGLEBEN: Yes.  CONAN: And then the next question is, is your name Fred, and we'd take a look at the difference between the two.  Prof. LANGLEBEN: Correct. And what you will see is increased - a relative increase in activity in some parts of the brain during particular type of questions. And then what you need to do is establish the pattern, knowing what is true and what is not true, try and correlate between a pattern that is the typical of truth and a pattern typical of lie. And then you will want to extrapolate it to the next group of people or subjects of patients that you will study to see whether their responses fit into that pattern that you just established.  CONAN: And that sounds, to me, at least at this point, is it capable of distinguishing, you know, shades of gray? Or is it. . .  Prof. LANGLEBEN: Well, no. This is what the paradigm or the format in which you ask the questions is for.  CONAN: Aha.  Prof. LANGLEBEN: To remove the shades of gray. And this technique is used with polygraph as well.  CONAN: They're all yes or no questions. Or black-and-white questions, yeah.  Prof. LANGLEBEN: Yes and no or relative - or questions with a limited number of possible answers. And I wouldn't be surprised if, with some sophistication, it can increase the number of possible answers to three, four, five, six, as long as the number is limited and the pattern is pre-established.  CONAN: Mm-hmm. Let's see if we can get some listeners questions in on this, too. 800-989-8255, if you'd like to join us, 800-989-TALK. E-mail is talk@npr. org. Steve, Steve's calling from Tulsa, Oklahoma.  STEVE (Caller): Yeah, I have a couple of questions, and I'll get my - listen to the response off the air, or off the phone. One thing that I have a question about is how do they - let's say someone is - to clear themselves of crime are required to take a - this new form of lie detector, we'll call it, how do they get around the HIPAA violation or HIPAA rules as far as medical information being released? And secondly, isn't the MRI interpretation as good as the interpreter, and wouldn't that hold a lot of challenges when court actions occur?  CONAN: Well, Daniel, I think you're certainly competent to answer the second part of that question.  Prof. LANGLEBEN: Well, both of those are excellent questions. Question number one about HIPAA: here, you need to decide whether we're talking about research or we're talking about a diagnostic procedure that falls in this realm of medicine or you're talking about non-medical use of a technology, and depending on that, HIPAA will or will not apply. And also it, of course, raises the issue of whether you want or can do this sort of testing in individuals who are not interested in cooperating with you.  CONAN: Mm-hmm.  Prof. LANGLEBEN: And I'll proceed to the second question.  CONAN: Go ahead.  Prof. LANGLEBEN: Can you repeat, by the way, that question to me? I think I lost that one.  CONAN: It was basically, I think, doesn't the quality of the test depend on the quality of the person who's interpreting the MRI?  Prof. LANGLEBEN: Right. Well, here is one area where MRI is - I expect MRI to have a significant advantage over at least the current state of interpretation of polygraph data, because MRI data is essentially analyzed and interpreted almost automatically. The only thing that is happening by hand is presetting of the thresholds of what's significant and what's not. So the analysis and interpretation of MRI data is very much a procedure that follows a set algorithm that has very little human intervention.  CONAN: While the polygraph has a considerable human factor in it.  Prof. LANGLEBEN: Correct.  CONAN: Yes.  Prof. LANGLEBEN: But it doesn't mean that polygraph cannot be made into much more algorithm-like process if somebody was interested in doing that.  CONAN: Would there be any benefit - just to follow up just a moment on Steve's thoughts - would be there be any benefit to incorporate, to use both of these simultaneously, since the kinds of questions are not too dissimilar?  Prof. LANGLEBEN: Absolutely. And this actually - if I can guess and imagine the future, this is what is most likely to happen, because we're talking about two measurements of different parts of the system, which is a human being. And while the polygraph is measuring essentially one channel of data, that is - or several channels of data coming from the activity of the peripheral nervous system, which is heart rates, skin conductants, et cetera.  While the FMRI's looking at brain activity, which has many more dimensions in a way, but it is a different spot to look at the activity of the human organism. So a combination of the two is much more - is likely to create superior accuracy. And more than that, the polygraph could serve essentially as a screening test for the more specific test of a functional MRI.  CONAN: Okay. Steve, thanks very much for the call.  STEVE: You're welcome.  CONAN: All right. The University of Pennsylvania is a hot bed for the development of lie detection technology, therefore, a hot bed of debate over its policy, its ethics, and its social implications. Paul Root Wolpe is a Senior Fellow at Penn's Center for Bioethics. He tracks development of lie detection technology. He's also on the board of the Neuroethics Society. And he's with us also from the Wharton School studios on the Penn campus, sitting right next to his colleague there. Nice to have you on the program today.  Prof. PAUL WOLPE (Senior Fellow, University of Pennsylvania's Center for Bioethics): Pleasure to be here.  CONAN: First Paul Root Wolpe, there have to be concerns about this. There are many concerns about this. And one of the fortunate things is that many of these scientists who are actually developing this are thoughtful about it and share many of these concerns. And there are two kinds of concerns.  There are concerns about the efficacy of the test itself and whether it works the way it's advertised and in whose hands it will work appropriately. And the second set of issues are what kind of a truthful society do we want, and under what circumstances do we want to use an accurate lie detector? And who gets to use it and who shouldn't be using it? And do we really want a society where even telling the kinds of social truths that many societies are based on -Asian society, for example, is actually constructed - many Asian societies - on a set of social lie-telling rituals.  So lies have an important place in society. There are some kinds of lies that all of us tell, and some kinds of lies that we wouldn't - you know, is that a beautiful baby, isn't my baby beautiful - those are the kinds of lies we all think are appropriate.  CONAN: Do I look fat in this? Yes.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Prof. WOLPE: Right. So there is a real debate that has to happen over who should have access to the technology and under what circumstances.  CONAN: Because it becomes clear, reading about this technology - and Dr. Langleben you can help us out here - it's coming, if it's not here yet, and there is a commercial version of this that makes its debut next month, whether that's good or not. This is happening. It's down the road.  Prof. LANGLEBEN: Right. And it's just beginning now. And as we move through the next years and decades, this technology is going to get more robust and more accurate. And that's why now is the time to begin this conversation.  CONAN: All right. If you'd like to join the conversation give us a phone call. Our number is 800-989-8255, that's 800-989-TALK. The e-mail address is talk@npr. org. We're talking about lies and new technology to detect them. I'm Neal Conan. We'll be back after a short break. This is TALK OF THE NATION, from NPR News.  (Soundbite of music)  CONAN: This is TALK OF THE NATION. I'm Neal Conan in Washington. We're talking today about building a better lie detector. New technology uses brain scans and promises greater accuracy. It also raises questions of ethics, privacy, and consent. Our guests are Daniel Langleben, who's an assistant professor of psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania. And Paul Root Wolpe, a senior fellow at Penn's Center for Bioethics.  Of course, you're invited to join us. 800-989-8255, 800-989-TALK. E-mail is talk@npr. org. And let's talk with Greg. Greg's calling from Provo in Utah.  GREG (CALLER): Hi, I do criminal defense work. I'm an attorney that represents a lot of criminals and I've met some pretty good liars, I think, in my time. Some that are pathological. They can tell the same story over and over again, and I think actually believe it when everyone else in the world is saying something different. And would their brain scans necessarily show that they were lying or are they - are their brains wired differently such that they can tell the story over and over again and convince themselves that it's the truth?  CONAN: Daniel Langleben?  Prof. LANGLEBEN: Well, again, this is an excellent question. And the answer is double here. First of all, theoretically, fMRI is much more likely to uncover a deception in an individual who does not have an emotional response to his or her behavior, which is a psychopath, because our tests were specifically designed to avoid provoking any excessive emotion or any emotion at all.  CONAN: Mm-hmm.  Prof. LANGLEBEN: While polygraph is essentially based on an anxiety related response and if such response is blunted, such as you would expect in a person with an anti-social personality disorder, what you call a psychopath, you are very likely to have a false negative finding. In fact, I think there are programs of training for polygraph evasion that teach people to do that.  I would expect that it would be much more difficult to do with your own brain activity, though, even that may not be impossible. I can imagine some system of biofeedback that could allow you to manipulate your own brain output, but that would be many steps away from what's available now.  CONAN: Hmm. So, in other words, there's promise that - you're saying it would be much more accurate than polygraph.  Prof. LANGLEBEN: That it would be much more valuable in this particular type of populations which are the prime sort of target of lie detection.  CONAN: Good liars? Good liars is who we're after here.  Prof. LANGLEBEN: So this would be an example of what I was suggesting as a potential combination of the use of polygraph and fMRI. That is an individual who cannot be tested with a polygraph successfully may be tested with a functional MRI. However, there is a sort of - the point is that this needs to be experimentally tested.  CONAN: Mm-hmm.  Prof. LANGLEBEN: This is, like I said, a theoretical prediction. And until it has been tested under controlled experimental conditions, in peer reviewed, academic-based work, you cannot really say that that's true. You can say that this is what you expect to be true.  Prof. WOLPE: And, Neal, I think this is one of the big issues that we're dealing with right now. We have two companies out there who are planning, in the fairly near future, on bringing brain imaging lie-detection technology to market. Many of these questions, pathological liars, people with personality disorders, have - these questions have not yet been tested empirically.  We don't know how people with different kinds of personalities, in different kinds of situations, are going to look when the fMRI technology is used on them. It hasn't been tested robustly with very different populations, with different ethnic populations in a robust way. And so my big concern about this technology is the prematurely of bringing it to market at this time; I don't think it's ready for primetime yet, and it's of great concern that there's a race now to bring this technology to market.  CONAN: Hmm.  GREG: Somebody with mental disease, though, is going to - their brain's going to be much different than a normal brain regardless of what test is being done though, correct?  Prof. LANGLEBEN: I would expect so, and, again, it would be a speculation. I just submitted a paper for publication exactly on this topic. And, unfortunately, there isn't experimental data on the subject and it needs to be done.  CONAN: Mm-hmm. Greg, thanks very much for the call.  GREG: Thank you.  CONAN: And let's go to Ray(ph). And Ray's calling from San Francisco.  RAY (CALLER): You know, most of us, at one time or another have harbored an idea or concealed a notion of some kind or other consciously and maybe the interviewers who were trained to use the new system of lie-detection could tease out or try to tease out our concealed information or deceits or conspiracies.  But, you know, all these things are on a continuum and when you think of it, most of us carry around notions of dubious - of factuality, factoids, PR hype, and various kinds of news spin and so on are in our consciousness at various times, so that must also be evaluated by an interviewer. So how do you distinguish between the (unintelligible).  CONAN: Presumably, Ray, you ask a specific question. Like, you know, where were you on Thursday at 9:00? And you're not going to say, you know - you're answer's not going to be conditioned by what you saw earlier that day on CNN or Fox, so. . .  Prof. WOLPE: You have to understand that lie detectors do not determine truth. The best lie detectors can do is determine what you think is true. And so a skilled person using this understands that what you are saying is simply what is true for you. And once you have that, then you have to begin to evaluate the information for whatever purpose you want to use it for.  RAY: Right. So what you're saying then is that an interviewer is going to look to infer some dissonance and that may not even be that the person being interviewed is aware of it.  CONAN: Hmm. Would that be accurate, Mr. Langleben?  Prof. LANGLEBEN: I'm sorry, can you repeat that?  CONAN: Ray's point is that there could be truths teased out that even the subject is not aware of that they are being exposed.  Prof. LANGLEBEN: Well, that would fall under a very different category and we could not even call it lie detection. If you want to describe it in some way, you would call it mind reading; essentially, trying to test what is stored in your memory without you even trying to shape it or deliver it to you, which is very different from lie-detection and it's a different line of research. Is it possible? It may be possible and it's even more fraught with potential dangers and problems and misinterpretation than lie-detection.  RAY: Well, do you find that verges on the area that the MRI will read?  Prof. LANGLEBEN: Again, it's completely outside of the scope of lie detection, but there are actually - there are a large number of researchers doing fMRI research related to this topic, essentially trying to correlate content of your memory with some kind of MRI pattern. And that includes false memory.  RAY: Maybe you're familiar with the story entitled The Demolished Man by Alfred Bestor, an advertising writer and science fiction author, who proposed a system for interfering with mind readers.  CONAN: Well, it was a science fiction novel with which I don't think they're familiar, because it's pretty obscure, but I'm familiar with it. And it was a (unintelligible) device, a tune that he hummed to avoid the mind readers. But Ray, thanks very much. We'll move right along with that.  RAY: Thank you.  CONAN: Anyway, let's see if we can get another question on the line. Jim. Jim's calling from Green Bay in Wisconsin.  JIM (CALLER): Good afternoon.  CONAN: It's a great book, by the way. If you find it, go read it. But it doesn't relate much to this. Go ahead.  JIM: Not allowing the technology to go ahead is infringing on the right of the innocent. If I were going to spend 20 years in prison for something I didn't do, I sure in heck wish I had the right to go take a polygraph, sodium pentothal, or anything that's available at the time to prove my innocence and I would wish it would be put in the court of law.  CONAN: Yeah, Paul Root Wolpe, that's the question that's been raised in this context, too.  Prof. WOLPE: Very much so. And the thing is that in order for that to be valuable, you have to have confidence that your technology works and works well. There are certainly very valuable uses of a reliable lie detector. Proving innocence is one of them and that's one of the reasons why both of these companies that are pursuing this technology now say that they're main goal will be to use this with people who are innocent and trying to prove their innocence.  The question here is not should we use this for those purposes. The question here is, what other purposes should we use this for? If my daught - if I find a dent in my car and my daughter says it's not her, do I have a right to grab her wrists and pull her over to the local lie-detection, you know, company and say I want to know if she was really out past curfew and dented the car? If I want to hire someone to be my bank teller, does bank management have the right to use this technology to screen its employees? Is the military going to start using this technology? Are they going to fly it down to Guantanamo Bay?  These are the questions that I think we need to begin to discuss now. Where is it appropriate to use this and under what circumstances? Assuming that it works properly and well.  CONAN: Daniel Langleben, as I understand it, the military helped fund your research, and I would assume that they are interested in it. Not necessarily the products that are coming out next month, though.  Prof. LANGLEBEN: They have funded the work that has been done so for, though to a very limited extent, I would say. And they - I think their interest was mainly in trying to demonstrate - to test whether there is a feasibility of using this technology. And that we've done. And at this point we do not have further plans for military funding.  CONAN: Let's get Jack on the line. Jack is calling from Petaluma in California.  JACK (CALLER): Yes. I was in the Navy in 1948. A Naval Officer going to school at Treasure Island. Something was stolen from a roommate of mine who was just a temporary roommate and I was called over to take a lie detector test. The military was using it back then. I refused it and walked out of the place. Nothing was ever done about it, but it was a pretty chilling thing.  I knew that I hadn't stolen the man's wristwatch and I would never take it again unless they hogtied me to the place. And I don't - the other gentleman said he might take it to prove his innocence. I think he would be crazy to do that, since it's admittedly not a 100 percent accurate.  CONAN: Mm-hmm.  JACK: That's all I have to say on that.  CONAN: All right. And thanks for the call. Paul Root Wolpe, I guess that's where you get onto questions of coercion. Well, you don't have to take it. Of course, if you don't. . .  Prof. WOLPE: Right, and that's the issue. With this technology, by the way, with the fMRI lie-detection technology you can't force someone to take this. If they really don't want to cooperate, it's very difficult to get the kinds of readings that you want and to get their - you must have their cooperation. So, in that sense, it's difficult to use this coercively.  But, as the caller just mentioned, there are other kinds of coercion. There's expectation. There's assumption of falsehood when someone refuses to use these technologies. And those kinds of coercive forces can be just as destructive and just as problematic.  CONAN: And we should point out, currently, and it's the only law that we know about, there's now law for this new technology, but for polygraph, it's not admissible in court, it can't be used by companies, but all levels of government can use it to screen employees, including the military.  Prof. WOLPE: That's right.  CONAN: We're talking with Paul Root Wolpe, a senior fellow at Penn's Center for Bioethics, and with Daniel Langleben, who's an assistant professor of psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania, about a better lie detector. And you're listening to TALK OF THE NATION, from NPR News.  And, Daniel Langleben, as you describe this technology, it does look like it has tremendous promise for your field, for psychiatry.  Prof. LANGLEBEN: That's correct. And my interest in this technology is, I would say, largely guided by that. Because, one of the callers for example, described the concern about interfering with one's memories, which is not exactly lie-detection, but related. Well, same technology can be applied to treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder. In the same way, lie-detection opens the door to a better understanding of unconscious defense mechanisms, one of which is denial. So, in a way, it could open the door to the, how would I say, restoration of the biological basis of psychotherapy, which is a method that has been pretty much on the back burner of modern psychiatry.  CONAN: Mm-hmm. Let's see if we can get another caller on the line. This is Matt. Matt's with us from St. Louis.  MATT (CALLER): Yes. Good afternoon. Actually, I have two questions for both your guests. Specifically, which region of the brain is the fMRI focused on that's determining if it's a truth or a lie? Is it a conscious part of the brain or is unconscious? Can you convince yourself that a lie is actually truth over some type of conditioning?  CONAN: And is it one section or several? Daniel Langleben.  Prof. LANGLEBEN: Well, I'll be grossly oversimplifying, so please forgive me. But what we see is a pattern that looks like what you need to activate if you want to control your behavior. As we originally hypothesized, the activity looks very similar to what you would need to activate in your brain to suppress a response of some sort.  CONAN: Mm-hmm.  Prof. LANGLEBEN: Now, this pattern will change depending on the particular nature and the order of the questions asked, and therefore each change in the pattern of the test would need to be validated and tested and verified. But if I have to answer it in a simple way: it is conscious and it's not just one part of the brain, it's a number of parts of the brain that work together.  CONAN: All right Matt, your other point?  MATT: Yeah, my other question was, and some other disorders have been mentioned, but has multiple personality been taken into account to see if that actually has different truth percentiles, I guess, depending on the personality that the person assumes?  Prof. LANGLEBEN: Well, we don't even know whether this technique will work in criminals, to say nothing about multiple personality disorder, which is an extremely rare condition.  CONAN: Mm-hmm. Ah. . .  Prof. LANGLEBEN: However. . .  CONAN: Go ahead, I'm sorry.  Prof. LANGLEBEN: I would expect that people who - as Dr. Wolpe said before, we're talking about you're subjective truth. And in multiple personality disorder, it's going to be pretty hard to find the subjective truth.  CONAN: Matt, thank you.  MATT: Well, thank you.  CONAN: Thanks very much for the call. And again getting back to what Professor Wolpe was talking about earlier, there are obviously degrees of untruths, everything from a bluff in a poker game to the social white lie to, you know, trying to get away with murder. Does the technology, at least as far as you've tested it, does it pick up all those differences?  Prof. WOLPE: This is Paul Wolpe.  CONAN: Go ahead.  Prof. WOLPE: The technology of fMRI looks at the response to a question that is asked. The technique or technology of asking these questions is really no different or little different in the fMRI as it is in polygraph. And for over 80 years, polygraph professionals have tried to perfect a technique whereby these kinds of - any kind of issue or question can be broken down into binary or forced choice answers.  So even if we're talking about something that has shades of truth, you try to ask yes, no or at least limited answer questions that would lead you, one after another, into those shades of truth. So it's part of the artistry of formulating your questions for these types of instruments. The fMRI doesn't change the basic need to have a skilled questioner.  CONAN: We'll take a couple of more questions on this when we get back from a break. I promise that's true. 800-989-8255, if you'd like to join us. 800-989-TALK. E-mail us, talk@npr. org. Plus, we'll remember TV pioneer Aaron Spelling. I'm Neal Conan. You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION, from NPR News.  (Soundbite of music)  CONAN: This is TALK OF THE NATION. I'm Neal Conan in Washington. And here are the headlines from some of the other stories we're following here today at NPR News.  Warren Buffet has announced he will give most of his $44 billion fortune to charity. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation will be the recipient of most of Buffet's generosity, receiving about 1. 5 billion dollars per year.  And Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert says he has ruled out bargaining with the captors of an Israeli soldier and has promised a broad and ongoing military offensive. The soldier was seized by Palestinian militants during a guerilla raid in southern Israel on Sunday.  Details on those stories and, of course, much more later today on ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. Tomorrow on TALK OF THE NATION, with tens of thousands of people waiting for an organ donation in this country, the need continues to far outstrip the supply. Some wonder why they can't buy an organ, or sell one. Others are horrified at the prospect. The ethics of organ donation and sales, next TALK OF THE NATION, from NPR News.  In a few minutes, he gave us the Love Boat, Dynasty, 90210, and redefined television drama. We'll remember Aaron Spelling with TV Guide's Matt Roush. But first, we're talking about technology to detect lies. Our guests are Daniel Langleben, an assistant professor of psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania, and Paul Root Wolpe, who's a senior fellow at Penn's Center for Bioethics.  If you'd like to join us: 800-989-8255, 800-989-TALK. E-mail is talk@npr. org. And let's get a question in from Howard. Howard's with us from Cleveland.  HOWARD (CALLER): Hi, Neal. Thanks for taking my call. An MRI is a pretty large and fairly expensive piece of equipment that you just can't roll into an office when you need use it. Are any of this type of technology results replicable through an EEG, which is much smaller and more portable?  CONAN: Daniel Langleben?  Prof. LANGLEBEN: Well, again, it's an excellent question. And, in fact, our work is based on prior work by Peter Rosenfeld from Northwestern University in Illinois with EEG. The difference between EEG and fMRI is that fMRI has many more dimensions of measuring brain activity compared to EEG, where the source of brain activity is hard to detect. So the answer is yes, it is very possible that some of the findings we have with fMRI could be repeated with EEG. However, we expect that the fMRI will remain superior.  HOWARD: Just as a follow-up, would it be as easy to read as automated as the fMRI or is it more user subjective?  Prof. LANGLEBEN: I would expect that interpretation of EEG data could be automated to the same extent of fMRI.  HOWARD: Great, thank you very much.  CONAN: Thanks, Howard.  Prof. LANGLEBEN: You're welcome.  CONAN: And let's see if we can talk with Jim. Jim in Oklahoma City.  JIM (CALLER): Hello, guys. I was just curious, I didn't know if anyone had addressed the cost issue versus the polygraph versus an MRI. I know, like the previous caller said, you know, MRIs are cumbersome, they're not portable really and. . .  CONAN: They cost millions of dollars each, yeah.  JIM: Exactly. And you would have to have, you know, I don't know, you would have to have, obviously, a radiologist to read the results, interpret the results, you couldn't just do it - just anyone interpret the results. So how would - what would the cost factor be compared to just regular polygraphs?  CONAN: Any idea?  Prof. LANGLEBEN: Daniel Langleben. I'll try to answer this. First of all, the cost of the machine itself, the scanner, is indeed very high. However, the -what is important here is an hourly cost of using the MRI. Because once the machine is installed it's essentially pure overhead until it's being used. So what you need to think about is an hourly cost of using an fMRI machine or MRI machine versus an hour of polygraph.  And I think at that point that costs start coming pretty much close together, because it's all about labor involved, more than the actual use of the scanner. There are hundreds of MRI scanners around the country, and many of them have excess capacity. That's part one.  The other issue is radiologists. In fact, interpretation of this data probably could be almost entirely automated and a radiologist probably is not a required part of interpreting this data, though radiologists could be participating in it and probably could contribute.  CONAN: Okay.  JIM (Caller): Okay, thanks guys.  CONAN: Thank you Jim. And the cost and the - as we look ahead to this, Paul Root Wolpe, I mean, clearly the costs are going to come down, the technology is going to improve, and that's really where your concerns begin.  Dr. WOLPE: It is. Then we have to decide, are we going to regulate this technology and say only certain people have access to it. Is anyone going to be able to use it when we get more and more robust lie detectors? And, especially, as we go on, there may be other kinds of technologies outside of fMRI that follow on the heels of fMRI that are more portable.  They're already trying things like functional near-infrared where they shine infrared light into the frontal cortex and then detect the reflection, and they can determine blood flow through that, and there's some evidence that that may be a passable lie detector. That would be extraordinarily portable and easy to use, less even, perhaps -- CONAN: And consent would not be involved. People could do it without your consent.  Dr. WOLPE: Well, the way it right now, you actually have to put a band across the forehead in contact with the skin, but the goal is to eventually develop one that is remote and, perhaps, even covert.  And then you have the additional question, though - I emphasize, we can't do this now - but then you have the additional question of, when you walk through that airport security checkpoint, is it perfectly okay to take someone into a side room and covertly use a lie detection technology with them. These are questions that we're actually going to have to begin grappling with.  CONAN: Thanks gentlemen, both, very much for your time; we appreciate it.  Dr. WOLPE: My pleasure.  Dr. LANGLEBEN: Thank you very much.  CONAN: We heard from Paul Root Wolpe who's a senior fellow at the University of Pennsylvania Center for Bioethics at the Department of Psychiatry, and from Daniel Langleben who's an assistant professor of psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania, all about the prospect of a better lie detector.

That's when a new law takes effect that calls for \"satisfactory documentary evidence of citizenship or nationality. \" That can be a passport, birth certificate, or certificate of nationalization. Proponents of the new law claim that stricter enforcement will ensure that illegal immigrants will not be able to access Medicaid benefits. Opponents worry that it could unfairly deny benefits to millions of American citizens already on Medicaid but unable to prove citizenship. Families USA, a national healthcare non-profit is challenging the constitutionality of the law. They're expected to file a lawsuit tomorrow in federal district court in Chicago. With us to talk about the new Medicaid identification requirements and how it affects recipients is Leslie Norwalk, deputy administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Service in the Department of Health and Human Services. She's with us by phone from her office in Washington, D. C. Nice to have you on the program today. Ms. LESLIE NORWALK (Deputy Administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Service in the Department of Health and Human Services): Thanks. Good to be here. CONAN: And specifically, what happens as of July 1st in terms of ID requirements? Ms. NORWALK: Well, on July 1st, the first thing to point out, what will happen is merely a documentation requirement. The Medicaid program has always required that someone have appropriate citizenship, U. S. citizenship or legal immigration status in order to qualify for the Medicaid program and prove eligibility, et cetera. So what happened before July 1st was beneficiaries would self-attest. What's happening July 1st and beyond for those new recipients. . . CONAN: When you say self-attest, you mean check off a box, I am a U. S. citizen? Ms. NORWALK: Correct. CONAN: Okay. Ms. NORWALK: What is happening going forward, so the requirements are the same, the documentation is in fact different. So that, you mentioned a number of different items already, for example a passport or a certificate of U. S. citizens for example. There are, these primary documents do things like show both identify and citizenship. So you're proven you're a citizen and the document itself also shows identity. CONAN: So you could have a birth certificate to prove that you're a citizen, I guess, and a driver's license to prove your identity. Ms. NORWALK: Exactly. CONAN: All right. Ms. NORWALK: That's exactly how it works. And the, one of the things that you mentioned before. Now this is something that - which is the, how many people would be affected. . . CONAN: Um-hmm. Ms. NORWALK: . . . one of the things, when the deficit reduction act was being debated in the Congressional budget office court that they thought about 35,000 current Medicaid recipients would be at risk over the next ten years of the program, as opposed to millions. So while, without a doubt there are some individuals who are currently getting Medicaid benefits who are not eligible for it, I suspect that quite a fair number will fall into that, we're very concerned that those who are citizens or otherwise have a legal immigration status - legal with not il, but legal -CONAN: Yes. Ms. NORWALK: We want to be sure that we give them an opportunity to provide whatever documentation or evidence they can to prove to us that they are in fact citizens and that they are who they say they are in terms of identity. So its, I appreciate that some people, for whatever reason, wouldn't have a birth certificate, and so we have all sorts of other ways to show citizenship that we are asking the states to implement on Saturday. CONAN: And on Saturday, does that mean that if you can't show a passport or that combination of things we were talking about earlier, your benefits would be cut off? Ms. NORWALK: Well, there are a couple, there are two different ways to look at this. the first is, who and when applying for eligibility, for those who don't have it, I would say that you don't get the benefits until you can show that you are a citizen and you are who you say you are. You are that identity. But for those who are actually currently in the Medicaid program, we require a reasonable opportunity. The states must give the recipient a reasonable opportunity to present documents that would establish their citizenship and identity. And, basically what we've asked the states to do is really let the beneficiary who's getting Medicaid benefits now, give them an opportunity to show good faith in providing that evidence, whether that's writing to the vital health statistics people and saying, can you help me with my birth certificate, or going to the hospital, et cetera, et cetera. CONAN: Um-hmm. Ms. NORWALK: And when that doesn't happen, the least, the level of documentation that we would require would be an affidavit. So even if, for whatever reason, you've gone through all these hoops and you haven't been able to get a hold of documentation what would prove citizenship, we do allow that beneficiary to use an affidavit to show that that person is a citizen. Now the affidavit is not one that should be easy to come by, because it will have two other people, one, only one who's related to you, would have to attest that they knew you were a citizen, and so forth. So that there are ways - where beneficiaries who have great difficulty in getting a hold of this type of documentation - where we would give them an opportunity to prove their citizenship and identity through some other method. And we're asking the states to, before they would take someone off the rolls, they need to assist the individual in securing these documents and figuring out ways to help the beneficiary get a hold of them, et cetera, because, in some instances, beneficiaries may have some difficulty and the state may have more ability to get those documents. CONAN: And one final point. You mentioned this is part of the Deficit Reduction Act. It might sound to some people like its gotten swept up into the whole controversy over immigration. Ms. NORWALK: It may. This is not about immigration. This is really about how it is that one documents eligibility for a federal program. This doesn't change the eligibility requirements at all. It merely is - this is what we need now to see that someone is in fact eligible. So. . . CONAN: Yep. Ms. NORWALK: It isn't a wholesale change in this program. It really is just a way for us to take, make use of the documentation that's already out there and have people show, at least once, that they have both a citizenship and that they are who they say they are. CONAN: Leslie Norwalk, thanks very much. Ms. NORWALK: Thank you. CONAN: Leslie Norwalk, Deputy Administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in the Department of Health and Human Services. She joined us by phone from her office in Washington, D. C. And you're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. Now to hear about the lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of this new law we turn to Ron Pollack, executive director and vice president of Families USA, who's with us here in Studio 3A. Thanks very much for joining us. Mr. RON POLLACK (Executive Director and Vice President of Families USA): Thanks for inviting me, Neal. CONAN: And, as Ms. Pollack was just saying - excuse me, Ms. Norwalk. You're Mr. Pollack. As Ms. Norwalk was just saying, you know, the eligibility requirements haven't changed, it's just the identification. Mr. POLACK: Well, that's right. If I may, Neal, one quick point. You indicated that Families USA is bringing the suit. Actually we're working with the counsel in the suit. The suit is being brought by the Sargent Shriver National Center on Poverty Law, and a few other counsel. I think what needs to be understood here is that there's a real irony in this law. The irony is that the proponents of this legislation wanted to appear tough on illegal immigrants, as you suggested. But the people who are actually going to be hurt are people who are U. S. citizens. Take, for example, people in nursing homes, people who have mental disabilities or other disabilities, people who suffered from some kind of natural disaster like Hurricane Katrina. Many of these folks can't come up with the documentation and those are the precise people who are going to be hurt by this requirement. CONAN: Along with the any illegal immigrants who may be registered as well. Mr. POLLACK: Right. But I think that virtually everybody that has looked at the Medicaid program has made clear that there aren't in any significant degree illegal immigrants in the program. Indeed, you're not even allowed to participate in Medicaid even if you're a legal immigrant if you haven't been in the country for over five years. And so the people who are going to be hurt are actually U. S. citizens who are not in a position to come up with this documentation and they're the ones who're going to be kicked out of the Medicaid program and join the ranks of the uninsured. CONAN: And you're not satisfied with the provisions that Leslie Norwalk was describing about, at the end of the day, the states first of all have to help you look for documentation, and at the end of the day if you can find two people who can say you're a U. S. citizen, you're okay. Mr. POLLACK: Well, what Leslie didn't describe is that the states are under a real compulsion here, under a short period of time, to get this done. If they don't get this done quickly, they actually are going to lose their federal funding under Medicaid. And there are some states, like California and Ohio that have complained that this is going to be very difficult to do. It's an unfunded mandate. And so I think as the states try to produce in response to this statute, very quickly, there are a lot of people who are going to fall through the cracks. And this idea that you can have affidavits - remember most people gain their citizenship through birth. Now, unless you've got people who were actually there, who know under what circumstances you were born, you can't actually provide such an affidavit. And somebody in a nursing home or somebody with a mental health problem is not likely to be able to marshal the information that is going to be required. CONAN: And what, briefly, does the lawsuit hope to accomplish? Mr. POLLACK: Well, what the lawsuit does is it tries to stop the implementation of this statute, which is, as you said, scheduled to go into effect on July 1. If this, if the lawsuit is effective, it will wind up preventing the implementation beginning on July 1 - the lawyers are seeking a temporary restraining order, so that at least this is postponed, if not totally taken off the books. CONAN: Postponed until the court can then look into the case? Mr. POLLACK: Ye. When you get a temporary restraining order that normally delays the implementation of something that will cause irreparable harm, and then you have a hearing on the merits. CONAN: Before going to court, I wonder, did you try to address this in other ways? I mean, as this act was going through Congress, did anybody call up and say, hey, this may have unintended consequences. Mr. POLLACK: Absolutely. And there were a lot of people who've said they're going to be numerous people are going to be cut off the program. There are estimates truly of as many as three to five million people who'll be terminated from the program. Now these are all estimates, because nobody truly knows. But this was pointed out to the conferees when they developed the Deficit Reduction Act. And by the way, there's still an opportunity to get this changed through legislation. There is going to be legislation that will be considered by the House and Senate sometime probably this year, a so-called Technical Corrections Bill. And it is our hope that at a minimum in that Technical Corrections Bill, this requirement will exempt people who are on Medicare and people who are on SSI. These are people who are disabled, who are old, people in nursing homes. So this is critically important that this gets corrected. CONAN: Ron Pollack, thanks very much. Mr. POLLACK: Thanks for inviting me. CONAN: Ron Pollack, executive director and vice president of Families USA, joining us today in Studio 3A. This is TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. I'm Neal Conan in Washington.  NEAL CONAN, host:  Starting Saturday, anybody applying for or receiving Medicaid benefits will have to show proof of U. S. citizenship. That's when a new law takes effect that calls for \"satisfactory documentary evidence of citizenship or nationality. \" That can be a passport, birth certificate, or certificate of nationalization.  Proponents of the new law claim that stricter enforcement will ensure that illegal immigrants will not be able to access Medicaid benefits. Opponents worry that it could unfairly deny benefits to millions of American citizens already on Medicaid but unable to prove citizenship.  Families USA, a national healthcare non-profit is challenging the constitutionality of the law. They're expected to file a lawsuit tomorrow in federal district court in Chicago.  With us to talk about the new Medicaid identification requirements and how it affects recipients is Leslie Norwalk, deputy administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Service in the Department of Health and Human Services. She's with us by phone from her office in Washington, D. C. Nice to have you on the program today.  Ms. LESLIE NORWALK (Deputy Administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Service in the Department of Health and Human Services): Thanks. Good to be here.  CONAN: And specifically, what happens as of July 1st in terms of ID requirements?  Ms. NORWALK: Well, on July 1st, the first thing to point out, what will happen is merely a documentation requirement. The Medicaid program has always required that someone have appropriate citizenship, U. S. citizenship or legal immigration status in order to qualify for the Medicaid program and prove eligibility, et cetera.  So what happened before July 1st was beneficiaries would self-attest. What's happening July 1st and beyond for those new recipients. . .  CONAN: When you say self-attest, you mean check off a box, I am a U. S. citizen?  Ms. NORWALK: Correct.  CONAN: Okay.  Ms. NORWALK: What is happening going forward, so the requirements are the same, the documentation is in fact different. So that, you mentioned a number of different items already, for example a passport or a certificate of U. S. citizens for example.

A couple of months ago, a report slammed the agency for not paying sufficient attention to prescription drugs on the market. A report released yesterday says the FDA is not enforcing its own rules and regulation often enough. NPR's Joanne Silberner reports. JOANNE SILBERNER reporting: Three years ago, FDA inspectors in England noticed big safety problems in the manufacturing plant that supplied the U. S. with vaccines. They told FDA headquarters about the problems; the agency did nothing. Then, a year later, British authorities noticed the problem and shut the plant down. As a result, many Americans couldn't get flu vaccine that year. Now, a review of the agency's own record shows the FDA didn't take action on lots of other problems as well. Democratic staffers on the House Committee on Government Reforms found that out by studying agency records over a five-year period ending in 2005. Dr. Jerry Avorn, of Harvard University, an author of a book critical of the FDA, reviewed the information for the committee. Professor JERRY AVORN (Professor of Medicine, Harvard University; Author): The big picture number that was of concern is this systematic decline in the number of enforcement activities of any kind that the FDA has engaged in over a last number of years. And it really has gone done sharply to the point where it's only about half as many enforcement activities as were in place several years ago. SILBERNER: The FDA turned down our request for an interview. In a written statement, the agency said it can't be judge by counting up the numbers of warning letters it's issued. That instead of focusing on quantity it has been picking its target carefully. But the report cites several examples of the agency disregarding problems that had killed people, including the failure to do anything after its field officers learned that four people had died when a supplier provided nitrogen instead of oxygen to an old age home. The report specifically cited a 66 percent drop in the number of warning letters issued by the FDA Center for Devices and Radiological Health or CDRH. Michael McGarry is executive vice president of the Trade Group for Medical Device Manufacturers. McGarry says the decrease in warning letters may not mean the FDA is paying less attention to flaws in surgical and medical equipment. Mr. MICHAEL MCGARRY (Executive Vice President of Public Affairs, AdvaMed): It's important to keep in mind that CDRH issues many types of warning letters that have nothing to do with the manufacturer of medical device, including advertising, mammography, facility inspections, airport x-ray system inspections, laser light show inspections and clinical trials. SILBERNER: FDA critic Jerry Avorn, of Harvard University, says it doesn't matter what the warning letters are about. What's most important is the message that a decrease in enforcement sends to other drug and device makers. Prof. AVORN: The purpose of warning letters is not just to deal with that one incident, but to let companies know that the FDA is on the case and the FDA is being vigilant. And when those letters don't get out, the message does get out, FDA is not going to be as effective or alert in dealing with the next thing that comes up. SILBERNER: He says it's part of a larger picture of an FDA unwilling to discipline drug companies for overstating the benefits of their products and advertisements and not acting more quickly on drugs that show problems, such as Vioxx. Democratic Congressman Henry Waxman, who commissioned the report, says its findings are another threat to FDA's reputation. Congressman HENRY WAXMAN (Democrat, California): I hope this report illustrates to the FDA that the American public is relying on it to do its job to make sure that we are continuously protected from unsafe foods or ineffective drugs or devices that may harm us. SILBERNER: On the Senate side, Republican Senator Charles Grassley is continuing to call for reform of the agency and has introduced legislation to make some changes. Other Senators are expected to introduce their own legislation soon. Joanne Silberner, NPR News, Washington.

Well, we've got one for you. One hundred years ago today, President Theodore Roosevelt signed the Pure Food and Drugs Act into law. Okay. So did that mean? I'll tell you. That laid the groundwork for the nation's oldest consumer protection agency: the Food and Drug Administration, the FDA. And while the FDA is set up to be a consumer's watchdog, critics point out that it hasn't had a permanent commissioner in five years - virtually throughout the entire Bush administration. Here to talk about the history and current status, or status, of the FDA is Joanne Silberner, who is the health policy correspondent for NPR. Thanks for talking to us today, Joanne. JOANNE SILBERNER reporting: Good to be here, Ira. FLATOW: Thank you. So, what is the history of the FDA? Why did Teddy Roosevelt set this up to begin with? Were things going so bad back there, 100 years ago? SILBERNER: Absolutely. You remember the medicine shows, snake oils, food was being adulterated, and food colorings were being added to disguise problems in food. Drugs were, I mean, most of the drugs being sold were basically alcohol. So you'd feel better for a little bit, but, you know, overall, nothing was out there that was going to cure you. It was, you know, it was really hard to feel safe about anything you ate or drank back then. FLATOW: Right, so it was a\u2026 SILBERNER: Unless you grew it yourself. FLATOW: Of course. I think that's still true today. That's another topic. Of course, then there was a whole string of acts that followed, right? SILBERNER: Right. And actually, you know, initially the agency didn't have much power. It was actually called the Bureau of Chemistry, and that's what started first in 1906. And basically, the Bureau had the ability to, if something falsely described itself - if a food or a drug was falsely described, sold across state lines, they could step in then. If it were poisonous, it was actually quite hard for them to step in. they lost a number of Supreme Court cases that said, you know, that they were limiting trade or they were limiting free speech. It didn't have much real power until 1938. That was the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. And that came in and said that drugs had to be proven safe: not effective, but safe, before they could be marketed. It wasn't until 1962, there was an amendment that came in and said that a drug had to prove itself effective before it could be sold on the market. FLATOW: All right, I'm going to ask you to put on your cap, your thinking cap, and come up, for me, what would you say, what would many people say, are the, is the single or the biggest FDA contributions to health to date? SILBERNER: Well, I think we can feel a lot better about the food and drugs that eat now than we did in 1906. You know, they certainly made things a lot safer. Did they make them safe enough - that's where you can get into some argument or disagreement. You know, trying to figure out what's safe and what's not safe, especially when you're looking at drugs, becomes a political issue. So, I think in the broad brush look it we're doing a lot better than we were. If you take a finer point to it, we could probably be doing a lot better as well. FLATOW: Um-hmm. And it has become a political issue, especially in recent years. I'm thinking of this case of, one of the women commissioners, or parse this out for me, who resigned over the abortion pill? SILBERNER: Right. Yeah, that was, she was in the Office of Women's Health, within the FDA. And what happened was, there'd been a series of decisions made by, or not made by, the FDA that she objected to. And the biggest one, this was Susan Wood, the biggest issue that she objected to was there had been an application to sell the Morning, so-called Morning-After Pill - it's basically high-dose birth control - a petition to sell it over the counter. And the, actually there have, you said in the beginning there have been no permanent commissioners. There have, there just haven't been a whole of permanent, there's been more often than not, not a permanent commissioner. And what you're asking about now is the answer to that. It's this issue of selling over the counter birth control. The last commissioner promised that he would take it to, he'd make a decision on it. And then he became appointed - he was the acting commissioner, and he made that promise that he'd make a decision. He got appointed. When the day came for his decision, his decision was, it needed more study. The current guy, who's the acting commissioner, has just been nominated. This is Andrew von Eschenbach. He's been nominated to be the permanent commissioner. I don't think that the senators who are pushing this are going to buy that thing again, yes I will decide soon by a date certain, because, you know, he could also do that same thing. You know, by the date certain, say gee, I think we need to study it a little bit more. It's become a very contentious issue. FLATOW: And why can't we keep a commissioner? Is it a political thing, or are there just so many issues that come up that are contentious and the people just throw up their hands and say I'm out of here: SILBERNER: I think it's a political thing. Mark McClelland, who was Bush's, the president's initial commissioner, probably would've held onto the job for a long time, but he was moved over to run another agency that is somewhat political, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services. And then, since then, the two commissioners who've been acting commissioners, you know, the issues for them have been this birth control issue. And also, the agency has been in, really in the public eye a lot more in the last five years than it ever has been because of issues like Vioxx, and because of issues like antidepressants in kids. FLATOW: Right. Um-hmm. There's a recent report that was put out by Democratic Representative Henry Waxman that finds that there's been a large drop over the past five years in warning letters sent out by the FDA to companies in violation of federal food and drug safety laws. This, to me, you know, sounds like the FDA is becoming a little bit lax in\u2026 SILBERNER: A lot of people think that. A lot of people. Now this particular report was commissioned by a Democrat, but you should know that the Republicans as well are very suspicious of what's been going on at the FDA. They've done all sorts of studies themselves and had hearings. You've now got, along with Democratic Rep. Henry Waxman, you've got Republican Senators Charles Grassley, Mike Enzi, Democratic Senator Edward Kennedy. All these people have plans that they're pushing that would make, that would, it's funny, they actually don't want to limit the power of the FDA: they want it increased. They want to increase the naysayer's within the FDA. They want to promote them and give them a little more power. FLATOW: That's interesting to see that its bipartisan support. SILBERNER: Yeah, and when you get bipartisan in this particular Congress, you see some action. FLATOW: And I guess that's because everybody does view the FDA, and rightfully so, as their watchdog. Right? I mean, that's what they're there for. SILBERNER: Yes. And this agency was absolutely the gold standard around the world. I mean it, dating back to the thalidomide problem in 1962 - it was a drug that was sold in Europe due to lax enforcement there. And in this country, before it went on the market, there was a woman at the FDA named Francis Kelsey, she took a look at the data. She said, this, I don't really like this drug. At great personal risk to herself, she fought the drug's approval, successfully. It was used experimentally here in this country, which is why you do have some thalidomide babies. She kept it off the market, and that really put the FDA on the road to being known throughout the world as the watchdog, the watchdog agency. That reputation has slipped a little bit in the last five years. FLATOW: Yeah. There are some things the FDA does not regulate, that we don't, that are not considered drugs, correct? I mean, that may be\u2026 SILBERNER: Well nutritional\u2026 FLATOW: Right. SILBERNER: \u2026they've been severely limited on what they can do about nutritional supplements. FLATOW: Right. SILBERNER: And that's an interesting issue, because the result is\u2026 FLATOW: Yeah, let's talk about that. SILBERNER: Well, it's a tough one, you know? The FDA is told by Congress what it can and cannot do. I believe, at least from the people I know within the agency, they'd love to get a lot more involved with nutritional supplements, but they can't. If it's not, if there's not a particular health claim made on the label of the, you know, right there on the label, they can't come in. I mean, if the label sys it contains this much of this herbal supplement or that much of that vitamin or mineral, as long as it's not a lethal amount they can't do much. FLATOW: Um-hmm. We're talking with Joanne Silberner on TALK OF THE NATION SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. And we're talking about the history of the FDA. What most fascinates you, Joanne, about the FDA? The fact that it has been so successful over the years or the fact that it's now just in trouble in a lot of critics' eyes? SILBERNER: I'd actually take a third option. What fascinates me is they have to walk the line between risk and benefit. And one person's, the risk that one person will take is very different than the risk another person will take. So you have a drug like Lotronex. This is a drug that treats a condition called Irritable Bowel Syndrome. If you have a severe form of this, you can't be far away from a bathroom. There are people who can't leave the house without this drug. But every once in awhile, it can cause a severe intestinal problem - even death. Should it be marketed? Well, the FDA looked at it, and the data looked a little tough. They came out and they said no. but there was a tremendous public outcry after it was pulled off the market. It went back on the market in limited distribution, you know, the FDA wants to limit it, but it's hard. Look at Vioxx. If doctors had only prescribed it for the people for whom it was initially approved, which is people with arthritis, people who need to take a painkiller every day over time and may not be able to take the intestinal risks of some of the other painkillers, if it had only been used for them, the risk might have been worth it. But it was over-marketed by the company, it was over-prescribed by doctors, and you had a disaster. FLATOW: Yeah. Very good point, because I know lots of doctors who would love to give this to patients who have no other choice. SILBURNER: Right. FLATOW: And these patients need it. And they, you know, and its, you're absolutely right. We have this whole situation now with drugs that there are -just so much of it is off-label, is it not? SILBERNER: Yes, there's an enormous amount of off-label use, and the FDA has attempted to market certain drugs with limited distribution and been unsuccessful, or somewhat unsuccessful. You take the drug Accutane for severe acne. Not, you know, not the kind that, you know, teenagers go through and will get rid of, but, you know, severe pitting acne. They, if a woman takes it while pregnant, one out of four chances that her baby is going to have a severe deformity. Fine, don't sell it to pregnant women. Well they came up with a registration program - that didn't work. They came up with a new registration program which requires you can only get a one-month prescription, you've got to go back to your doctor, show two negative, you know, two pregnancy test that come out negative. There are still, it is still happening. You know, people share prescriptions, whatever reason, it is still happening. So what do you do? It's a great drug for the condition\u2026 FLATOW: Yeah. SILBERNER: \u2026but shouldn't be used in other people. FLATOW: Well, Joanne, thank you for taking time. I know you're a busy reporter there at NPR. Thank you for taking time to talk with us today and good luck to you. SILBERNER: Thank you, Ira. FLATOW: Have a good holiday. SILBERNER: Thank you. FLATOW: Joanne Silberner is health policy correspondent for NPR. And that's all the time we have for today.  IRA FLATOW, host:  Need cause to celebrate today? Well, we've got one for you. One hundred years ago today, President Theodore Roosevelt signed the Pure Food and Drugs Act into law.  Okay. So did that mean? I'll tell you. That laid the groundwork for the nation's oldest consumer protection agency: the Food and Drug Administration, the FDA. And while the FDA is set up to be a consumer's watchdog, critics point out that it hasn't had a permanent commissioner in five years - virtually throughout the entire Bush administration.  Here to talk about the history and current status, or status, of the FDA is Joanne Silberner, who is the health policy correspondent for NPR. Thanks for talking to us today, Joanne.  JOANNE SILBERNER reporting:  Good to be here, Ira.  FLATOW: Thank you. So, what is the history of the FDA? Why did Teddy Roosevelt set this up to begin with? Were things going so bad back there, 100 years ago?  SILBERNER: Absolutely. You remember the medicine shows, snake oils, food was being adulterated, and food colorings were being added to disguise problems in food. Drugs were, I mean, most of the drugs being sold were basically alcohol. So you'd feel better for a little bit, but, you know, overall, nothing was out there that was going to cure you. It was, you know, it was really hard to feel safe about anything you ate or drank back then.  FLATOW: Right, so it was a\u2026  SILBERNER: Unless you grew it yourself.  FLATOW: Of course. I think that's still true today. That's another topic. Of course, then there was a whole string of acts that followed, right?  SILBERNER: Right. And actually, you know, initially the agency didn't have much power. It was actually called the Bureau of Chemistry, and that's what started first in 1906. And basically, the Bureau had the ability to, if something falsely described itself - if a food or a drug was falsely described, sold across state lines, they could step in then. If it were poisonous, it was actually quite hard for them to step in. they lost a number of Supreme Court cases that said, you know, that they were limiting trade or they were limiting free speech.  It didn't have much real power until 1938. That was the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. And that came in and said that drugs had to be proven safe: not effective, but safe, before they could be marketed. It wasn't until 1962, there was an amendment that came in and said that a drug had to prove itself effective before it could be sold on the market.

I'm Lynn Neary. STEVE INSKEEP, host: And I'm Steve Inskeep. Good morning. This next story sheds light on one of nature's tiny mysteries, the question of how some insects find there way around. You were just wondering this, weren't you? Desert ants may wander around for hours searching for food. When they find it they make beeline back to their nest. Now scientists have figured out how they do that, as NPR's Richard Harris reports. RICHARD HARRIS reporting:  Ants may be tiny but they are also amazing. A desert ant can wander for hours in a featureless landscape, but it can usually finds its way straight back to its nest. These ants maintain a sense of direction simply by keeping track of all of their twists and turns.  Measuring distance, however, is a tricky business. Harold Wolf at the University of Ulm in Germany says one thought was that these ants use their eyes to measurer the rate at which the scenery is passing by. That's what bees do but not so for ants. Mr. HAROLD WOLF (University of Ulm): You can, for instance, put them on a conveyor belt and move a visual pattern underneath them. But it doesn't alter the distance measurement of the ants. HARRIS: So if ants are using their eyes to measure distance, what are they using? Wolf gave his graduate student, Mathias Whitlinger(ph), the crack assignment to figure out how the ants do find their way home. One thing he tried was to clip off the ends of the ant's legs. He says desert ants often lose there feet in the searing hot desert sand anyway. The ants then set across a simulated desert in a lab, and sure enough with shorter legs they took shorter steps. And they stopped short of their nest. That suggested that the ants are actually counting there steps. But Wolf says it doesn't prove the point. Mr. WOLF: You can always argue, okay, it hurts and the animal's injured and the animal can't walk that far anymore, so it'll stop short anyway. And so the good idea was just extend the leg. HARRIS: They extended the ants legs by building stilts out of fine pig hairs and then gluing them on the end of the ant's legs. And as you would expect with each step on stilts the ants covered more ground. Mr. WOLF: And in fact they did walk farther.  HARRIS: The ants with stilt legs overshot their nest. So as they report in Science Magazine, it appears that ants really are counting their steps in order to gauge distance. But of course insects aren't counting with numbers. So there must some other mechanism within the nervous system that makes that tally. Wolf has no idea what that would be.  Mr. WOLF: You'd have to record the nervous system of these animals, and they're pretty small, so that's difficult. HARRIS: Too difficult, at least with today's technology. But it is a deeply interesting question. The answer could help explain how some animals navigate, often better than we humans can manage. Wolf says if they can figure it out, it could also be useful for building robots.  Mr. WOLF: If you want to build a robot that finds it's own around, they have to navigate, and, well, it's easy to do this in a rather coarse way. But if you really wanted to be exact and find a way exactly back to where it came from, that's quite a problem. HARRIS: A problem that lowly desert ants have solved.

Dolly was the first cloned mammal ever born. It raised the possibility that if you could clone one mammal, maybe you could clone them all, including humans. NPR's Joe Palca reports on the implications ten years later. JOE PALCA reporting: The procedure for making a clone isn't all that complicated. You take the DNA from an adult cell and put it into an egg from which most of the DNA has been removed. You then coax the egg to behave as if it were fertilized. If it does, the resulting embryo will be a genetic copy of the adult animal. Put that embryo into a surrogate mother, and if everything goes well, you get offspring. Ian Wilmut led the team at the Roslin Institute outside Edinburgh that created Dolly. Even though the steps are straightforward, Wilmut said, when interviewed ten years ago, that getting them to work was not. Dr. IAN WILMUT (Embryologist, Roslin Institute): We transferred 29 eggs into a recipient (unintelligible), and one of them became a live lamb. So you can see it's a very exciting and encouraging result. The efficiency's are poor and there's a need for a lot more research. PALCA: Dolly's birth came as a shock. True, scientists had successfully cloned amphibians, but the only success in mammals using cloning techniques came when scientists started with DNA from embryonic cells, which hardly counts.

MICHAEL ROBERTS (Professor of Veterinary Pathobiology, University of Missouri-Columbia): I think the real surprise to everybody was the fact that it came from an adult cell and that somehow or other this adult cell could be reprogrammed and then made to act as though it was completely youthful again. PALCA: One of the Scottish team's key discoveries was to find the critical moment to extract the DNA from the living adult cell. Armed with that knowledge, scientists began cloning everything in sight. Dr. ROBERTS: Rabbit, horse, cow, goat\u2026 PALCA: Pigs, cats, dogs, mules and, oh, yes, mice were cloned, too. For some, it was just too tempting not to try applying the technique to humans. In 1998, Chicago physicist Richard Seed was among the first to publicly jump into the human cloning arena. Dr. RICHARD SEED (Physicist): It was my objective to set up a human clone clinic, make it a profitable fertility clinic\u2026 PALCA: Seed's plans caused a national uproar. But, in the end, they came to nothing. Then there was the fringe religious sect known as the Raelians. Brigitte Boisselier made this dramatic announcement on December 27, 2002. Dr. BRIGITTE BOISSELIER (Scientific Director, Clonaid): I am very, very pleased to note that the first baby clone is born. She was born yesterday at 11:55 a. m. PALCA: But Boisselier never presented any evidence she really had a clone, and most people think it's unlikely she does. So far, it's proven notoriously difficult to clone primates. It hasn't worked in monkeys and no one has yet made a cloned human embryo. South Korean scientists claimed that achievement only to admit later that their work was fabricated. The Korean scientists weren't the only ones trying to make human cloned embryos. Several scientific teams around the world are still trying, but their intention is not to make a baby; they want to make embryonic stem cells. The ability to make cloned embryos means you could make stem cells tailored to an individual patient. These would, in theory, be ideal for stem cell-based therapies, since there would be no chance of immune rejection. Dolly's creator, Ian Wilmut, has turned his research to this so-called therapeutic cloning. Wilmut is now working on ALS, a fatal neurological condition also known as Lou Gehrig's disease. Dr. WILMUT: Since we've begun to speak about working on ALS, I've met a number of people who have the condition and it's a very unpleasant disease and there's nothing for it at the present time. So, as a non-clinician to have the possibility of contributing, albeit, something long-term to therapy, I find very exciting. PALCA: One final note: why name the first cloned lamb Dolly? Well, the starting adult cell used to make Dolly came from the mammary tissue of a female sheep. Here's a musical hint, and I think we can leave it at that. (Soundbite of Dolly Parton song) Ms. DOLLY PARTON (Singer; Songwriter): (Singing) Folks back home think I'm a star now when they hear my records play\u2026 PALCA: Joe Palca, NPR News, Washington.  STEVE INSKEEP, host:  Ten years ago today, in Scotland, a lamb was born. Dolly was the first cloned mammal ever born. It raised the possibility that if you could clone one mammal, maybe you could clone them all, including humans. NPR's Joe Palca reports on the implications ten years later.  JOE PALCA reporting:  The procedure for making a clone isn't all that complicated. You take the DNA from an adult cell and put it into an egg from which most of the DNA has been removed. You then coax the egg to behave as if it were fertilized. If it does, the resulting embryo will be a genetic copy of the adult animal. Put that embryo into a surrogate mother, and if everything goes well, you get offspring.  Ian Wilmut led the team at the Roslin Institute outside Edinburgh that created Dolly. Even though the steps are straightforward, Wilmut said, when interviewed ten years ago, that getting them to work was not.  Dr. IAN WILMUT (Embryologist, Roslin Institute): We transferred 29 eggs into a recipient (unintelligible), and one of them became a live lamb. So you can see it's a very exciting and encouraging result. The efficiency's are poor and there's a need for a lot more research.  PALCA: Dolly's birth came as a shock. True, scientists had successfully cloned amphibians, but the only success in mammals using cloning techniques came when scientists started with DNA from embryonic cells, which hardly counts.

I'm Robert Siegel. MICHELE NORRIS, host: And I'm Michele Norris. Chicago is a city known for its food, from deep-dish pizza to Polish sausage, laden with sauerkraut. Lately, the city's also getting the reputation as a place where the long arm of the law reaches into the restaurant kitchen. Last month, the city banned restaurants from selling fois gras, fattened goose livers. Now, if one of the city's most powerful aldermen has his way, the Windy City would also become the first in the nation to ban restaurants from using oils that contain artificial trans fats. Alderman Edward Burke wants trans fats banned because they're linked to heart disease, increased cholesterol and obesity. Kim Severson is a reporter for the New York Times and she's written a book called The Trans Fat Solution: Cooking and Shopping to Eliminate the Deadliest Fat from Your Diet. She says trans fat is the one fat we shouldn't be eating at all. Ms. KIM SEVERSON (Author, The Trans Fat Solution: Cooking and Shopping to Eliminate the Deadliest Fat From Your Diet): The federal dietary guidelines that came out last year recommended that people consume less than one percent of their calories, or about two grams of trans fat a day. And that might translate to, oh, a glazed donut or maybe a small handful of French fries from many of the big fast food companies that are still using trans fat in the deep fat fryers. The Institutes of Medicine, which is part of the National Academies, said the only safe level of trans fat is zero. NORRIS: Now Kim, we're hoping that you can give us the skinny on trans fat. First, what is trans fat? Ms. SEVERSON: Well, trans fat's the only artificial fat in our diet. So, if you really want to get a dinner party going, bring up the subject of dietary fats. You'll clear the table quickly. But it's just, in a nutshell, there's three kinds of naturally occurring fats. We know saturated fat and polyunsaturated and olive oil, which is monounsaturated fat. Trans fat is a fat in transition; it's going from a polyunsaturated fat into a saturated fat. So that transition happens, it's stopped partially through, which they call partial hydrogenation, and you have partially hydrogenated oil, or an oil that's artificial. So when it goes into your body, your body doesn't quite know how to process it. It's sort of like putting a plastic fat into your body. NORRIS: So it's sort of a semi-solid state and never really breaks down? Ms. SEVERSON: Right. Which, if you think about Crisco, certainly the old-fashioned kind of Crisco, that's trans fat. NORRIS: Kim, when were trans fats first developed and when did they start to enter the American diet? Ms. SEVERSON: Well, trans fats go back almost 100 years, and they were invented when people started to be able to ship food across the country. Trans fats allowed that food to stay fresher longer so, as the food industry grew, so did the use of trans fats. But it was really the growth of the fast food industry in the 70s, that put a lot of trans fat in our diet because it was in the fast food deep fryers, you know, it's in the coating on the fillets of fish and chicken nuggets that we eat. NORRIS: So if you're using trans fat in, say, French fries or donuts, or a cookie, what does that do to the end product? How much does that boost the fat content in that food item? Ms. SEVERSON: Well, first of all, anybody who's made a pie crust knows that Crisco is a great thing to use because it stays solid, it makes a really flaky pie crust. It can really take a beating, which is why fast food restaurants love it so much. You can put it in the deep fat fryer, heat it repeatedly, and it's going to really do the job for a long period of time. And it's also very inexpensive and it can keep packaged good fresh for a long time on the shelf. The reason that it's bad is that it raises your bad cholesterol, but unlike saturated fat, which also does that, it lowers your good cholesterol. NORRIS: Where do we find trans fats? Ms. SEVERSON: Well you can find it anywhere and at one point it was in about 40 percent of the packaged goods you'd buy; all the potato chip and the snack food companies, most of the major ones have now gone to sunflower oil, safflower oil, oils that don't contain trans fats, and you'll see zero trans fat on many labels. There's a little bit of a trick when you look on a food label and it says zero trans fat. If a serving contains a half a gram of trans fat or less, they can claim that it's zero trans fat. But if you're like me, one serving of chips, you know, I'm just kind of getting warmed up, right? So we all usually eat beyond what the recommended serving is on packages. NORRIS: It's usually about five chips. Ms. SEVERSON: Exactly. So you can get, you know, easily a gram or two of trans fat just by a snack of chips that say zero trans fat. NORRIS: So if Alderman Burke has his way and Chicago bans the use of trans fat in restaurant kitchens, it would join some other countries that have done this, Denmark, for instance. What's happened in those countries where they've banned trans fat? What do they reach for in the restaurant instead? Ms. SEVERSON: Well there are certainly a lot of new oils and very traditional oils, that you can use that take the place of trans fat. The problem is they're more expensive. Olive oil, butter, all of those very traditional kinds of fats that we used to eat, can do pretty well in industrial kitchens. And also the big seed oil manufacturers, Archer Daniel Midland and a few others, are coming up with alternatives and growing oil seeds that can perform the way that a trans fat-based oil does. It's just more expensive. So some of those European countries are using these new breeds of oil. Some of them are going back to more traditional oil, Canola oils, oils that break down a little more quickly and then therefore cost a little more money, but are better for you. NORRIS: Kim Severson, thanks so much for talking to us. Ms. SEVERSON: Thanks. Happy to be here. NORRIS: Kim Severson.

Steven Green pleaded not guilty to rape, and four counts of murder. He also waived a detention hearing and a preliminary hearing. Green was honorably discharged from the Army in May, because he had something called antisocial personality disorder. That is when someone is extraordinarily manipulative and willing to exploit others, and has no sense of guilt. NPR's Joanne Silberner tells us more about the disorder. JOANNE SILBERNER reporting: Someone a layperson might consider a psychopath or a sociopath, or just plain horrible, is to Stuart Yudofsky someone with antisocial personality disorder. Yudofsky's head of psychiatry at Baylor College of Medicine, in Methodist Hospital in Houston. He won't comment on Steven Green's case, but he says people with antisocial personality disorder are good at hiding their condition. Dr. STUART YUDOFSKY (Psychiatry, Baylor College of Medicine): It can be to their advantage to be deceitful and not conform to laws, and to exploit other people and they do not, as a rule, come to mental health professionals and ask for this behavior to be changed. SILBERNER: Yudofsky says it occurs in about one percent of women and three percent of men. Most don't go as far as rape and murder, as is alleged in the Green case, but the condition is certainly more common in the prison population. Kim(ph) User(ph), a psychologist at Dartmouth Medical School, says antisocial personality isn't a typical mental illness. People seem rational, Dr. KIM USER (Psychology, Dartmouth Medical School): But they're very peculiar in other ways. They don't seem to care about other people. They don't feel guilty about the kind of transgressions somebody would ordinarily feel guilty about. They tend to be very impulsive, easily angered and easily provoked. And they tend not to follow conventional societal rules. SILBERNER: The picture often comes clear when you talk to teachers, family members, or bosses. Part of the diagnosis depends on a history of severe behavior problems in childhood, a condition called conduct disorder. Dr. USER: Some of the classic symptoms or signs of it include aggression to other people and animals, including, for example, cruelty to animals, initiating fights. There might be destruction of property, deceitfulness, and theft, and other serious violation of rule. SILBERNER: And like the adult version, there's no remorse. About 40 percent of children with conduct disorder will go on to have antisocial personality disorder. Both Yudofsky and User have stories to tell about the people they've treated. Yudofsky talks of a man in prison for murder, who said he'd done nothing wrong. He had to kill because the homeowner showed up while he was robbing his house. And User talks of a man who had sexually molested his sister and really couldn't see what was wrong with that. If the Army's diagnosis is correct and former Army Private Steven Green has antisocial personality disorder, getting his story could be difficult. Most people with the condition are very good liars. That and the denial that goes along with the condition, makes treatment difficult. Again, Kim User: Dr. USER: In fact, there's no agreed-upon treatment approach for people with antisocial personality disorder. Now that having been said, people with antisocial personality disorder, are also prone to developing other problems as well. SILBERNER: That includes substance abuse and other mental illnesses such as depression or schizophrenia. And people with antisocial personality disorder can be treated for those. But Yudofsky says sometimes the most you can do is support family members; help them recognize the condition and figure out how to keep from being hurt, physically or emotionally.

I'm Robert Siegel. MICHELE NORRIS, host:  And I'm Michele Norris. Imagine spending a hot day at the bottom of a deep hole that smells like an oil can. You're surrounded by layers of sticky black goo that clings to you and everything else it touches, and you're loving every minute of it. That describes the way some people in Los Angeles are spending the summer, at the city's famous La Brea Tar Pits. As NPR's Mandalit del Barco reports, they're looking for bones of creatures that haven't walked the earth since the last Ice Age. MANDALIT DEL BARCO reporting: At a park along Wilshire Boulevard, in the middle of L. A. , 11-year-olds Lane Kendall(ph) and Darby Henry(ph) mull over a lake of bubbling black asphalt. Unidentified Boy #1: It smells really bad. Unidentified Boy #2: Uh-huh. Unidentified Boy #1: It looks really gooey. Unidentified Boy #2: Yeah. I could imagine the animals getting stuck in it. DEL BARCO: Here at the La Brea Tar Pits, a replica wooly mammoth raises its trunk as if trapped in the methane ooze, the sort of thing that happened nearly 40,000 years ago when Ice Age animals roamed the area. Page Museum Curator John Harris says it was cooler and more humid then, more like today's San Francisco, with asphalt boiling up from a petroleum reservoir. Mr. JOHN HARRIS (Curator, Page Museum): A bison, or a horse, or a ground sloth or a camel would inadvertently step on this and they would become stuck, just like a fly on a flypaper, and so this would attract the local carnivores and in would come the saber-toothed cats and the dire wolves and the lions to feed off the remains, and of course they would get stuck in turn. And then down would come the vultures and the birds of prey, and they, too, would get stuck, and in come the flies to feed off them, and they get stuck. DEL BARCO: What remains of the creatures is a gloppy soup of bones, which is still being excavated by professional and amateur paleontologists all these year later. Thirteen and a half feet below the surface, in La Brea Pit 91, Samantha Green(ph) and two volunteers lie on their stomachs to reach into the muck. Their jeans and T-shirts are filthy, their bare hands seeped in prehistoric glop and gunk, smelling like rotten eggs. Ms. SAMANTHA GREEN (Excavator, La Brea Tar Pits): You get used to it. I mean, some days are stinkier than others. The warmer it is, the more seepage, the smellier it gets. You'll notice, though, it sort of clings to you. DEL BARCO: In a notebook, Green jots down precise measurements, while Zoe Kaplan(ph) and Sara Cohen pull out specimens with tiny dental instruments. Unidentified Woman #1: We have the hip of a saber-tooth cat. DEL BARCO: You just found that? Unidentified Woman #1: Yeah, it just came loose. Unidentified Woman#2: We have a more exciting chunk next to it than that. DEL BARCO: I can see bones sticking out. Unidentified Woman #1: Actually, you can see here, it's in this corner right here. The larger bone is a humorous of a juvenile saber-tooth cat. We have a dire wolf rib that's sticking out of the west wall. Unidentified Woman #2: And over here, this is actually a larger chunk of giant ground sloth pelvis. DEL BARCO: Kaplan and Cohen are among a team of volunteers working this summer. They earned their way to Pit 91 after spending hundreds of hours in the Page Museum lab, scrutinizing prehistoric sediment and polishing bone. Kaplan, who's 17, is contemplating whether to become an archeologist. She's excited about going back to the lab with her latest discoveries. Ms. SARA KAPLAN (Volunteer, La Brea Tar Pits): We're going to have like a nice shiny piece of bone, and just lots of satisfaction from that. Knowing that you dug it up, it's pretty cool. You're like a part of history, you know? DEL BARCO: Since 1915, scientists have discovered more than 650 species of animals and plants at Pit 91, reputed to be the world's only Ice Age paleontological dig in a major city. Every summer they find thousands more bones, fossilized seeds, and microscopic organisms. Museum Collection Manager Chris Shaw(ph) says they pull out as many as 50 specimens a day. Mr. CHRIS SHAW (Collection Manager, Page Museum): That thrill of discovery, of uncovering something that hasn't seen the light of day for 38,000 years or so, is really an exciting thing to do. Mr. HARRIS: This is arguably one of the richest Ice Age fossil sites in the world. DEL BARCO: Curator John Harris says Pit 91 is giving scientists a glimpse of what Los Angeles was like 40,000 years ago. Mr. HARRIS: You have the end of the last Ice Age and global warming, and perhaps we can seek to find a direct parallel between what happened then and what's happening now. If global warming goes on the way it does, this is going to be under water, as it was 100,000 years ago. DEL BARCO: From the excavated finds, scientists have already recreated a Pleistocene garden at the La Brea Tar Pits, with redwoods and sycamores, a prehistoric set more realistic than anything found on a nearby Hollywood lot. Mandalit del Barco, NPR News, Los Angeles.  ROBERT SIEGEL, host:   From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Robert Siegel.  MICHELE NORRIS, host:   And I'm Michele Norris. Imagine spending a hot day at the bottom of a deep hole that smells like an oil can. You're surrounded by layers of sticky black goo that clings to you and everything else it touches, and you're loving every minute of it.  That describes the way some people in Los Angeles are spending the summer, at the city's famous La Brea Tar Pits. As NPR's Mandalit del Barco reports, they're looking for bones of creatures that haven't walked the earth since the last Ice Age.  MANDALIT DEL BARCO reporting:  At a park along Wilshire Boulevard, in the middle of L. A. , 11-year-olds Lane Kendall(ph) and Darby Henry(ph) mull over a lake of bubbling black asphalt.  Unidentified Boy #1: It smells really bad.  Unidentified Boy #2: Uh-huh.  Unidentified Boy #1: It looks really gooey.  Unidentified Boy #2: Yeah. I could imagine the animals getting stuck in it.  DEL BARCO: Here at the La Brea Tar Pits, a replica wooly mammoth raises its trunk as if trapped in the methane ooze, the sort of thing that happened nearly 40,000 years ago when Ice Age animals roamed the area. Page Museum Curator John Harris says it was cooler and more humid then, more like today's San Francisco, with asphalt boiling up from a petroleum reservoir.  Mr. JOHN HARRIS (Curator, Page Museum): A bison, or a horse, or a ground sloth or a camel would inadvertently step on this and they would become stuck, just like a fly on a flypaper, and so this would attract the local carnivores and in would come the saber-toothed cats and the dire wolves and the lions to feed off the remains, and of course they would get stuck in turn.  And then down would come the vultures and the birds of prey, and they, too, would get stuck, and in come the flies to feed off them, and they get stuck.  DEL BARCO: What remains of the creatures is a gloppy soup of bones, which is still being excavated by professional and amateur paleontologists all these year later. Thirteen and a half feet below the surface, in La Brea Pit 91, Samantha Green(ph) and two volunteers lie on their stomachs to reach into the muck. Their jeans and T-shirts are filthy, their bare hands seeped in prehistoric glop and gunk, smelling like rotten eggs.  Ms. SAMANTHA GREEN (Excavator, La Brea Tar Pits): You get used to it. I mean, some days are stinkier than others. The warmer it is, the more seepage, the smellier it gets. You'll notice, though, it sort of clings to you.  DEL BARCO: In a notebook, Green jots down precise measurements, while Zoe Kaplan(ph) and Sara Cohen pull out specimens with tiny dental instruments.  Unidentified Woman #1: We have the hip of a saber-tooth cat.  DEL BARCO: You just found that?  Unidentified Woman #1: Yeah, it just came loose.  Unidentified Woman#2: We have a more exciting chunk next to it than that.  DEL BARCO: I can see bones sticking out.  Unidentified Woman #1: Actually, you can see here, it's in this corner right here.

The U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service says Asian Carp have not advanced beyond a lock and dam on the Illinois River, about 50 miles southwest of Chicago. So they are no closer to entering Lake Michigan than they were a year ago. But bighead and silver Asian carp are rapidly taking over parts of the Illinois downriver. And as NPR's David Schaper reports, one of the only ways to possibly control the population might be best phrased: if you can't beat it, eat it. DAVID SCHAPER reporting: Looking for Asian carp on the Illinois River is a little like toward the sky on the 4th of July. (Soundbite of people cheering) Mr. ERIC LEIS (U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service): And it almost went in. SCHAPER: Silver carp are so skittish that they leap out of the water, some six to eight feet high when disturbed by the sound and wakes of motorboats. Mr. LEIS: Boy, they're really jumping high back there. SCHAPER: Eric Leis of the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service leads one of the agency's carp corral teams, netting fish in various locations on the Illinois River to determine how far upstream Asian carp have moved and how fast their population is growing. This is his fifth year on the carp corral, and Leis says there are more Asian carp than ever before. Mr. LEIS: We had so many carp in these nets this morning that they actually - the carp pulled the nets downriver. So we really haven't had that happen before. SCHAPER: Silver and bighead Asian carp can grow to be 80 to 100 pounds each, and they consume up to 40 percent of their body weight in plankton each day. That's a critical food source for some native species, especially young fry. Asian carp were brought into the U. S. in the early \u201870s to reduce algae in catfish farms in the South. Floods washed them into the Mississippi River in the \u201880s, and they've been working their way up it and its tributaries ever since. They've thrived in the Illinois River especially well, and biologists with the Illinois Natural History Survey see initial signs that Asian carp may be starting to crowd out two native species: gizzard shad and largemouth buffalo. Mr. ORION BRINEY (Commercial Fisherman): Well, we used to fish for buffalo and stuff, and we'd catch these accidentally. SCHAPER: Commercial fisherman Orion Briney says bighead Asian carp began filling his nets several years ago and quickly cut into his ability to make a living. But now they're his bread and butter, because rather than quit, this third-generation fisherman changed course and now fishes specifically for Asian carp. (Soundbite of boat engine) It's just after dawn, and Briney and his stepson, Jeremy Fisher, are out on the Illinois River about 30 miles north of Peoria laying out nets. Mr. BRINEY: Let go, don't worry about it. It's straight back here, Jeremy. Yeah, just let it go. SCHAPER: Briney then turns the 30-foot flat-bottom boat upriver and searches the horizon for telltale ripples in the otherwise calm early morning water. (Soundbite of boat engine) Mr. BRINEY: That's fish. See it out there? How different it looks? That's a big school of them. SCHAPER: Briney then goes upriver of the fish. So you just keep making passes back and forth? Mr. BRINEY: Yeah, keep trying to - just trying to herd them like cattle. Trying to keep them moved down that way. SCHAPER: Briney drives thousands of bighead carp down towards the nets, which quickly fill up. (Soundbite of water splashing) SCHAPER: The fish weigh at least 15 to 25 pounds each. Briney and Fisher pull up the heavy net by hand and toss each flopping fish into the bottom of the boat. They'll get 14 cents a pound for these carp. Not a lot, but Briney says they more than make up for that with the huge volume of fish. In fact, he says since he started fishing for Asian carp, he's doubled his income. Mr. BRINEY: Boy they're ugly fish. I used to think that, but now I think they look pretty good. About $4 a fish. That's pretty good, huh? SCHAPER: Briney and Fisher take in about 10 to 12,000 pounds of Asian carp from the river on this morning, and they drive their catch to Schafer Fisheries, a processing plant in Thompson, Illinois. Mr. MIKE SCHAFER (Owner, Schafer Fisheries): We've been developing a market for this fish for about the last seven years. SCHAPER: Owner Mike Schafer says his company sells more than 2 million pounds of Asian carp a year, mostly in Asian-American communities in California, New York, and Chicago. He's invested in a new flash freezer, and hopes to soon start selling Asian carp to China and other Asian markets. Others in the Midwest are beginning to fish and process Asian carp, too. And there's hope that the increased fishing will help control the invasive Asian carp population. David Schaper, NPR News.

I'm Joe Palca. A brief program note: join Neal Conan and guests on Monday for a discussion about the latest developments in the Middle East. And for the rest of this hour, we'll be talking about languages. Mr. PETER KALIFORNSKY (Author, A Dena'ina Legacy, K'tl'egh'i Sukdu: The Collected Writings of Peter Kalifornsky): (Speaking foreign language) PALCA: That's tape of Peter Kalifornsky. He's talking about hunting beavers and butchering and drying them for winter. The language he's speaking is the Kenai dialect of Dena'ina. Dena'ina is one of the 3,500 languages still spoken on earth that may become extinct by the end of the century. The decline of these languages may be inevitable. But now the National Endowment for the Humanities and the National Science Foundation have teamed up to preserve a record of them before they're gone for good. Joining me to talk about this preservation effort and why scientists think it's crucial is Terry Langendoen. He's coordinator of cyberinfrastructure in the Behavioral and Cognitive Sciences Division, and co-director of the linguistics program at the National Science Foundation in Arlington, Virginia. He joins me today by telephone from his office there. Welcome to the program. Mr. TERRY LANGENDOEN (Coordinator of Cyberinfrastructure, Behavioral and Cognitive Sciences Division, Co-Director of Linguistics Program, National Sciences Foundation): Hi. Thank you, Joe. PALCA: And - oh, if you want to hear more of the Dena'ina language, you can go to www. qenaga. And I'll spell that for you - it's Q-E-N-A-G-A. org. And if you want the rest of the instructions for butchering beavers, the story appears in A Dena'ina legacy: the Collected Writings of Peter Kalifornsky, 1991. Edited by James Kari and Alan Boraas. Fairbanks, Alaska, Native Language Center. And if you'd like to join us after you've read that and tell us what the instructions say, you can give us a call. Our number is 800-989-8255. That's 1-800-989-TALK. And I guess the first question is how many languages are there in the world and how many are endangered? Mr. LANGENDOEN: Well, you actually gave the figure which is pretty close. We can only give, you know, sort of broad estimates partly because of trying to figure out exactly what we mean by language. But the current best estimates are between 6000 and 7000 languages are still spoken on this planet, of which roughly half are threatened with extinction by the end of this century. PALCA: And why? Mr. LANGENDOEN: Well, there are a number of factors. Probably looking from within a community, the most important factor is the failure of the new generation, the children, to learn or acquire the language of their community. And there are a number of reasons why children may not be interested or want to or be able to acquire those languages. One is they don't hear it spoken around them, and the second is they've lost the motivation because of the, shall we say, the invasion of a dominant culture from outside. PALCA: Right. Is there other - I mean, are we coming to a point where there's going to be like six languages left on the planet? Or is there some bottom number that people think we'll reach and then that'll be it and then there won't be any more disappearances? Mr. LANGENDOEN: Well, a lot of course depends on the political future of the earth. So languages are very closely identified with nations, as I'm sure our listeners are aware. So we can expect that many hundreds of languages and certainly - with respect to the current century, we were predicting that there will still be several thousand left. But what you have to think about this: if children are the transmitters of a language, and so we pass it down from generation to generation, each community, each group of speakers of a language have to ask, will my great-grandchildren be speaking this language? And so as you examine the factors, that might lead to your grandchildren or great-grandchildren not speaking. That will give you some idea. So we can expect that there will be some baseline, assuming the continuation of a society as it now exists, of many hundreds if not thousands of languages. PALCA: We're talking about the efforts of the National Science Foundation, and interestingly enough, the National Endowment for the Humanities, not to preserve, but - maybe we can talk about - not to preserve language, but to at least to document them before they're gone forever. And we'd like to hear from you. Our number is 800-989-8255. That's 1-800-989-TALK. And Dr. Langendoen, I wonder, you know, what's the difference between trying to preserve a language and trying to document it? Dr. LANGENDOEN: Well, documentation, as the National Science Foundation is interested in having as complete and as accurate a record of a language as we can possibly obtain by sending linguists out into the field or collecting transcriptions, audio and video tapes, and analyses. The usefulness to the community - the resources that we obtain in this way can then be used by a language community for training teachers, for actually using in the classroom with children, or for that matter, making it fun and interesting for kids so that they are motivated to learn their native or their heritage language. PALCA: Let's take a call now and go to Gary(ph), in Elverta, California. Gary, welcome to the program. GARY (Caller): Hi. Thank you for taking my call. PALCA: Sure. GARY: My name is - I'm Gary Mulckay(ph). I'm with the Winnemem Wintu tribe. My tribal name is actually Ponte Teius(ph). PALCA: Hi. GARY: About four years ago, there was a program out of Holland, a language preservation program, and we approached them because the last fluent speaker of our language was getting very old. As a matter of fact, it was Florence Jones, our spiritual and tribal leader, and she passed away in 2003. When we approached them to try and help get our language preserved, they told us that our language is too endangered and they wouldn't take it on. PALCA: Hmm. Dr. LANGENDOEN: Wow. Okay. PALCA: Wow. So is that - are there languages now that, Dr. Langendoen, you think are too endangered? Dr. LANGENDOEN: Our interest is to work with whatever resources that are available or that can be made available, both for communities and for researchers. So we would certainly not turn down an application for funding from a community such as we just heard about. PALCA: So, if - I mean, but is this the kind of thing that individuals could apply for applications, or do they have to try to find a linguist and convince them to apply for money to do this documentation? Dr. LANGENDOEN: Well, bear in mind that our solicitation is in fact a competition. So it would probably be wisest for - well, if the community has already people that they're working with for documenting and describing the language, then they could proceed right away. Part of the objectives of the DEL Initiative is also training, in particular training of native speakers of languages to learn to do all the techniques. Some of it is actually just using equipment like microphones and video recorders. PALCA: DEL? You said DEL. I'm not quite sure what that was. Dr. LANGENDOEN: I'm sorry, that's the name of - I'm sorry, that's the abbreviation for the acronym for the project. PALCA: Ah-ha. Documenting Endangered Languages. Dr. LANGENDOEN: Yeah. That's right. Yeah. PALCA: Okay. Dr. LANGENDOEN: We have a bad habit in the Foundation of speaking in acronyms, and I apologize. PALCA: You get to Washington and it becomes an occupational hazard. But I'm thinking, if Gary goes onto the NSF website, will he maybe be able to find researchers in California, for example, that might be already receiving grants from you and might be talked into getting. . . Dr. LANGENDOEN: Gary, I would appreciate it if you would send me either an e-mail message or call me. My number, if I may give it - is it okay, Joe? PALCA: Yeah. Take a chance. You might get a lot of calls. Dr. LANGENDOEN: Okay. PALCA: I think you should. Dr. LANGENDOEN: It's area code 703-292-5088. And my e-mail address is D as in dog, L-A-N-G-E-N-D at N-S-F. gov. But I wish you luck. . . PALCA: Okay, Gary, I hope you got all that down, and if you didn't, you can go back and listen to it later at the NPR Web site, or download the Podcast, or whatever. But thanks very much for your call. GARY: Yeah. Can I make one more point? PALCA: Oh sure, go ahead. GARY: I want to disagree with him on one point. When he said that it's because the young folks didn't take an interest in learning it, I don't know what happened in the rest of the United States, but I do know what happened in California with our ancestors and our tribal people. Most of our children - I shouldn't say most - all of them that did not escape were taken to Indian schools, boarding schools. They were not allowed to speak their language. If they spoke their language they were punished. They were not allowed to practice any religious practices. If they did they were punished. So there was a very strong drive back in the 1800s when California became a state, and the children were taken to boarding schools to eradicate the culture here. PALCA: Well, hopefully those days, I hope - and I'm sure there are arguments that could be made on the other side - but I hope those days are over. And maybe this program that the NSF and the National Endowment of Humanities is undertaking is a good example that things are changing. Dr. LANGENDOEN: Regrettably, what was just described is still happening in parts of the world. I mean, I described one factor that leads to endangerment, but this is also another one. PALCA: Let's take another call now. Let's go to Ruth(ph), in Rancho Cordova, California. Ruth, welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. RUTH (Caller): Hi. Thank you. My question is this: my father - my parents are Mennonites and they spoke a particular dialect, I guess you'd call it - Low German. Plattdeutsch. I wondered if anything is being done to preserve this language or this dialect. Dr. LANGENDOEN: I don't know of specific efforts working on, dealing with Plattdeutsch. I happened to have been in Bremen, in northern Germany, a couple of years ago on a visit, and I noted that I went by when I was actually being a tourist that there was an office there for the study of Plattdeutsch. So my suggestion would be to see what resources are available actually in Germany itself, as well as, I suspect, in the communities that still speak Plattdeutsch in this country and elsewhere. RUTH: Right. But that's not one of the languages that you're preserving. Is that correct? Dr. LANGENDOEN: We don't have any projects on Plattdeutsch at the moment. If a case can be made we would certainly consider a proposal. RUTH: Right. And because it's not a written - like it's not a written language. So that's also another problem. You know, it's - like it's only high German that's a written language. Dr. LANGENDOEN: Yeah. Right. PALCA: Ruth, thanks so much for that call. You know, it raises an interesting question about what's the different between a dialect and a language. Dr. LANGENDOEN: Yes. We. . . PALCA: What's the difference? Dr. LANGENDOEN: Yeah, in the interest of keeping our listeners interested in what we're talking about I won't launch into a long discussion of this. The main criterion that linguists use is something called mutual intelligibility. So if two - let's use the general term, language variety, you know, to cover both dialects and languages proper - so if two varieties can be understood by each of the speakers of the other language, or the other variety, excuse me, then those would be considered dialects and not separate languages. But there are many other factors that come into play. PALCA: Right. We're talking about an effort by the National Science Foundation and the National Endowment for the Humanities to document dying languages. I'm Joe Palca, and this is TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. And you're welcome to join the conversation. Our number is 800-989-8255. That's 1-800-989-TALK. How important is it to have a written documentation of a language as opposed to an auditory documentation, where you just have recordings of it? Dr. LANGENDOEN: Well, I would say both are important. And I would add a third factor: if we can get good audio/video tapes of people carrying on life as its lived in a community, for example, a bunch of people sitting around preparing dinner or playing with their kids, or children, let's say, playing soccer, that would be a very, very useful resource to have for the detailed study of the language. So it's not just vocabulary and grammar that we're interested in. We're interested in how the language is used and how it relates to life in the community as a whole. As you know, when you are a student of a language, say taking a course in college or even in high school or grade school, a lot of it seems very artificial because you're just doing, you know, rote learning of various kinds of expressions. But if you're actually using the language in a situation where you need it to get along, right, to find a place to stay for the night, or to get a dinner, or to get a meal, then it becomes much more important to you that it get it and get it right. PALCA: Right. You know, when you announced that this program was starting, Dr. Arden Bement, the head of NSF, said it was important for cognitive sciences. Do you know what he was talking about there? Dr. LANGENDOEN: Oh, yeah, that's a big motivation for us. In fact, the concern to document endangered languages or dying languages really arose in, I would say, probably it became - linguists had their consciousness raised about this largely through the work of a few pioneers, Michael Krauss at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks, is one. The late Ken Hale at MIT is another. And they pointed out - in particular Ken pointed out - that each language comes with its own special way of - sort of its own special intellectual structure. And we need to know how each language works in order to have a complete picture of the human capacity for language. In other words, if we are - if we grow up and we're listening to the language that we just heard on that audio tape, despite how foreign it sounded to our ears, we would pick it up. And we don't really fully understand yet, as scientists, how that happens. PALCA: We only have about 30 seconds left, but I'm wondering, I can't let this go - I'm curious to know if you have learned any of these endangered languages or speak any of them. Dr. LANGENDOEN: I can, I regretfully - I worked on, most recently, on a language, Yaki; spoken in northwestern Mexico and also in Tucson, Arizona, where I used to work. And I'm afraid my communication skills in that language are very, very poor. But it's - I have worked on a whole variety of such languages in my - during my career. PALCA: Hmm. So you couldn't tell us, like, put down that rock, or where's a good place to have dinner, in Yaki. Dr. LANGENDOEN: Right. Right. Exactly. Or please don't hit me with that hammer, right? I'm afraid that's not in my capacity. PALCA: That's the first bit of knowledge I try to gain when I learn any language. Well, I'm afraid we've run out of time for this hour. But it's a fascinating topic. I'd like to thank my guest, Terry Langendoen. He's the coordinator for cyber infrastructure in the Behavioral and Cognitive Sciences Division, and co-director of the linguistic program at the National Science Foundation in Arlington, Virginia. He joined me by phone from his office. Thanks for coming on the program. Dr. LANGENDOEN: Thank you very much, Joe. It was a pleasure.  JOE PALCA, host:  From NPR News, this is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Joe Palca.  A brief program note: join Neal Conan and guests on Monday for a discussion about the latest developments in the Middle East.  And for the rest of this hour, we'll be talking about languages.  Mr. PETER KALIFORNSKY (Author, A Dena'ina Legacy, K'tl'egh'i Sukdu: The Collected Writings of Peter Kalifornsky): (Speaking foreign language)  PALCA: That's tape of Peter Kalifornsky. He's talking about hunting beavers and butchering and drying them for winter. The language he's speaking is the Kenai dialect of Dena'ina. Dena'ina is one of the 3,500 languages still spoken on earth that may become extinct by the end of the century.  The decline of these languages may be inevitable. But now the National Endowment for the Humanities and the National Science Foundation have teamed up to preserve a record of them before they're gone for good.  Joining me to talk about this preservation effort and why scientists think it's crucial is Terry Langendoen. He's coordinator of cyberinfrastructure in the Behavioral and Cognitive Sciences Division, and co-director of the linguistics program at the National Science Foundation in Arlington, Virginia. He joins me today by telephone from his office there. Welcome to the program.  Mr. TERRY LANGENDOEN (Coordinator of Cyberinfrastructure, Behavioral and Cognitive Sciences Division, Co-Director of Linguistics Program, National Sciences Foundation): Hi. Thank you, Joe.  PALCA: And - oh, if you want to hear more of the Dena'ina language, you can go to www. qenaga. And I'll spell that for you - it's Q-E-N-A-G-A. org. And if you want the rest of the instructions for butchering beavers, the story appears in A Dena'ina legacy: the Collected Writings of Peter Kalifornsky, 1991. Edited by James Kari and Alan Boraas. Fairbanks, Alaska, Native Language Center.  And if you'd like to join us after you've read that and tell us what the instructions say, you can give us a call. Our number is 800-989-8255. That's 1-800-989-TALK.  And I guess the first question is how many languages are there in the world and how many are endangered?  Mr. LANGENDOEN: Well, you actually gave the figure which is pretty close. We can only give, you know, sort of broad estimates partly because of trying to figure out exactly what we mean by language. But the current best estimates are between 6000 and 7000 languages are still spoken on this planet, of which roughly half are threatened with extinction by the end of this century.  PALCA: And why?  Mr. LANGENDOEN: Well, there are a number of factors. Probably looking from within a community, the most important factor is the failure of the new generation, the children, to learn or acquire the language of their community. And there are a number of reasons why children may not be interested or want to or be able to acquire those languages.  One is they don't hear it spoken around them, and the second is they've lost the motivation because of the, shall we say, the invasion of a dominant culture from outside.  PALCA: Right. Is there other - I mean, are we coming to a point where there's going to be like six languages left on the planet? Or is there some bottom number that people think we'll reach and then that'll be it and then there won't be any more disappearances?  Mr. LANGENDOEN: Well, a lot of course depends on the political future of the earth. So languages are very closely identified with nations, as I'm sure our listeners are aware. So we can expect that many hundreds of languages and certainly - with respect to the current century, we were predicting that there will still be several thousand left.  But what you have to think about this: if children are the transmitters of a language, and so we pass it down from generation to generation, each community, each group of speakers of a language have to ask, will my great-grandchildren be speaking this language? And so as you examine the factors, that might lead to your grandchildren or great-grandchildren not speaking. That will give you some idea.  So we can expect that there will be some baseline, assuming the continuation of a society as it now exists, of many hundreds if not thousands of languages.  PALCA: We're talking about the efforts of the National Science Foundation, and interestingly enough, the National Endowment for the Humanities, not to preserve, but - maybe we can talk about - not to preserve language, but to at least to document them before they're gone forever. And we'd like to hear from you. Our number is 800-989-8255. That's 1-800-989-TALK.  And Dr. Langendoen, I wonder, you know, what's the difference between trying to preserve a language and trying to document it?  Dr. LANGENDOEN: Well, documentation, as the National Science Foundation is interested in having as complete and as accurate a record of a language as we can possibly obtain by sending linguists out into the field or collecting transcriptions, audio and video tapes, and analyses. The usefulness to the community - the resources that we obtain in this way can then be used by a language community for training teachers, for actually using in the classroom with children, or for that matter, making it fun and interesting for kids so that they are motivated to learn their native or their heritage language.  PALCA: Let's take a call now and go to Gary(ph), in Elverta, California. Gary, welcome to the program.  GARY (Caller): Hi. Thank you for taking my call.  PALCA: Sure.  GARY: My name is - I'm Gary Mulckay(ph). I'm with the Winnemem Wintu tribe. My tribal name is actually Ponte Teius(ph).  PALCA: Hi.  GARY: About four years ago, there was a program out of Holland, a language preservation program, and we approached them because the last fluent speaker of our language was getting very old. As a matter of fact, it was Florence Jones, our spiritual and tribal leader, and she passed away in 2003. When we approached them to try and help get our language preserved, they told us that our language is too endangered and they wouldn't take it on.  PALCA: Hmm.  Dr. LANGENDOEN: Wow. Okay.  PALCA: Wow. So is that - are there languages now that, Dr. Langendoen, you think are too endangered?  Dr. LANGENDOEN: Our interest is to work with whatever resources that are available or that can be made available, both for communities and for researchers. So we would certainly not turn down an application for funding from a community such as we just heard about.  PALCA: So, if - I mean, but is this the kind of thing that individuals could apply for applications, or do they have to try to find a linguist and convince them to apply for money to do this documentation?  Dr. LANGENDOEN: Well, bear in mind that our solicitation is in fact a competition. So it would probably be wisest for - well, if the community has already people that they're working with for documenting and describing the language, then they could proceed right away.  Part of the objectives of the DEL Initiative is also training, in particular training of native speakers of languages to learn to do all the techniques. Some of it is actually just using equipment like microphones and video recorders.  PALCA: DEL? You said DEL. I'm not quite sure what that was.  Dr. LANGENDOEN: I'm sorry, that's the name of - I'm sorry, that's the abbreviation for the acronym for the project.  PALCA: Ah-ha. Documenting Endangered Languages.  Dr. LANGENDOEN: Yeah. That's right. Yeah.  PALCA: Okay.  Dr. LANGENDOEN: We have a bad habit in the Foundation of speaking in acronyms, and I apologize.  PALCA: You get to Washington and it becomes an occupational hazard. But I'm thinking, if Gary goes onto the NSF website, will he maybe be able to find researchers in California, for example, that might be already receiving grants from you and might be talked into getting. . .  Dr. LANGENDOEN: Gary, I would appreciate it if you would send me either an e-mail message or call me. My number, if I may give it - is it okay, Joe?  PALCA: Yeah. Take a chance. You might get a lot of calls.  Dr. LANGENDOEN: Okay.  PALCA: I think you should.  Dr. LANGENDOEN: It's area code 703-292-5088. And my e-mail address is D as in dog, L-A-N-G-E-N-D at N-S-F. gov. But I wish you luck. . .  PALCA: Okay, Gary, I hope you got all that down, and if you didn't, you can go back and listen to it later at the NPR Web site, or download the Podcast, or whatever. But thanks very much for your call.  GARY: Yeah. Can I make one more point?  PALCA: Oh sure, go ahead.  GARY: I want to disagree with him on one point. When he said that it's because the young folks didn't take an interest in learning it, I don't know what happened in the rest of the United States, but I do know what happened in California with our ancestors and our tribal people. Most of our children - I shouldn't say most - all of them that did not escape were taken to Indian schools, boarding schools. They were not allowed to speak their language. If they spoke their language they were punished. They were not allowed to practice any religious practices. If they did they were punished. So there was a very strong drive back in the 1800s when California became a state, and the children were taken to boarding schools to eradicate the culture here.  PALCA: Well, hopefully those days, I hope - and I'm sure there are arguments that could be made on the other side - but I hope those days are over. And maybe this program that the NSF and the National Endowment of Humanities is undertaking is a good example that things are changing.  Dr. LANGENDOEN: Regrettably, what was just described is still happening in parts of the world. I mean, I described one factor that leads to endangerment, but this is also another one.  PALCA: Let's take another call now. Let's go to Ruth(ph), in Rancho Cordova, California. Ruth, welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY.  RUTH (Caller): Hi. Thank you. My question is this: my father - my parents are Mennonites and they spoke a particular dialect, I guess you'd call it - Low German. Plattdeutsch. I wondered if anything is being done to preserve this language or this dialect.  Dr. LANGENDOEN: I don't know of specific efforts working on, dealing with Plattdeutsch. I happened to have been in Bremen, in northern Germany, a couple of years ago on a visit, and I noted that I went by when I was actually being a tourist that there was an office there for the study of Plattdeutsch. So my suggestion would be to see what resources are available actually in Germany itself, as well as, I suspect, in the communities that still speak Plattdeutsch in this country and elsewhere.  RUTH: Right. But that's not one of the languages that you're preserving. Is that correct?  Dr. LANGENDOEN: We don't have any projects on Plattdeutsch at the moment. If a case can be made we would certainly consider a proposal.  RUTH: Right. And because it's not a written - like it's not a written language. So that's also another problem. You know, it's - like it's only high German that's a written language.  Dr. LANGENDOEN: Yeah. Right.  PALCA: Ruth, thanks so much for that call. You know, it raises an interesting question about what's the different between a dialect and a language.  Dr. LANGENDOEN: Yes. We. . .  PALCA: What's the difference?  Dr. LANGENDOEN: Yeah, in the interest of keeping our listeners interested in what we're talking about I won't launch into a long discussion of this.  The main criterion that linguists use is something called mutual intelligibility. So if two - let's use the general term, language variety, you know, to cover both dialects and languages proper - so if two varieties can be understood by each of the speakers of the other language, or the other variety, excuse me, then those would be considered dialects and not separate languages. But there are many other factors that come into play.  PALCA: Right. We're talking about an effort by the National Science Foundation and the National Endowment for the Humanities to document dying languages. I'm Joe Palca, and this is TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.  And you're welcome to join the conversation. Our number is 800-989-8255. That's 1-800-989-TALK.  How important is it to have a written documentation of a language as opposed to an auditory documentation, where you just have recordings of it?  Dr. LANGENDOEN: Well, I would say both are important. And I would add a third factor: if we can get good audio/video tapes of people carrying on life as its lived in a community, for example, a bunch of people sitting around preparing dinner or playing with their kids, or children, let's say, playing soccer, that would be a very, very useful resource to have for the detailed study of the language.  So it's not just vocabulary and grammar that we're interested in. We're interested in how the language is used and how it relates to life in the community as a whole.  As you know, when you are a student of a language, say taking a course in college or even in high school or grade school, a lot of it seems very artificial because you're just doing, you know, rote learning of various kinds of expressions. But if you're actually using the language in a situation where you need it to get along, right, to find a place to stay for the night, or to get a dinner, or to get a meal, then it becomes much more important to you that it get it and get it right.

I'm Melissa Block. ROBERT SIEGEL, host: And I'm Robert Siegel. A new study finds that men and boys with autism have fewer neurons in the part of the brain involved in memory and emotion. NPR's Jon Hamilton reports on the latest evidence that this area of the brain may be one of the keys to understanding autism. JON HAMILTON reporting: For a long time, it wasn't clear how the brains of people with autism differed from other brains. That began to change in the 1980s, when a group of scientists examined the entire brain of a man with autism. He died at age 29 and his brain had been sliced into thousands of thin sections. Dr. Margaret Bauman of Harvard University was part of the group that did the research. She says scientists used microscopes to compare slices from the autistic brain with matching slices from the brain of a typical man who died at age 25. Dr. MARGARET BAUMAN (Harvard University): We could look at identical sections in the autistic brain and in the control brain. And we could look at them side by side, which is basically what we did. We went through this entire brain. HAMILTON: One slice at a time. Bowman says one place they found a difference was in the amygdala. It's an almond-shaped clump of cells deep in the brain. Actually, there are two amygdalae, one on each side. And they're critical to processing certain emotional reactions, particularly fear. Bauman says it looked like the brain cells from the man with autism were smaller and more densely packed. Dr. BAUMAN: We were pretty excited about it at that time because this was really the first time anybody had shown any definite abnormalities at a microscopic level about brains and autism. HAMILTON: Ever since then, scientists have been trying to get a better understanding of exactly what's different about the amygdala of a person with autism. The latest effort comes from scientists at UC San Diego and the MIND Institute at UC Davis. They compared the brains from nine people with autism with the brains from ten typical people. The people ranged in age from 10 to 44 and had died from a variety of causes. Dr. David Amaral of the MIND Institute says the team used automated techniques to estimate the number of brain cells in each amygdala. Amaral says the brains of people with autism were clearly different. Dr. DAVID AMARAL (MIND Institute): Overall, there was a decreased number of neurons in the amygdala, and then particularly in one subdivision of it called the lateral nucleus. HAMILTON: Which communicates with a part of the brain that controls perception. Typical brains had about 12 million neurons. Brains from people with autism averaged about 1 million fewer. Amaral says it makes sense that there would be a difference in the amygdala because people with autism tend to be very anxious. Dr. AMARAL: The amygdala's involved in appreciating dangerous situations in the environment and generating an appropriate response to danger, which is fear and escape. And probably in a pathological state, leads to anxiety. HAMILTON: Brain-imaging studies have already shown that in boys with autism, the amygdala develops early and stops growing around the age of eight. In typical boys, it continues to grow until age 18. Amaral says it's possible that this early development accounts for the reduced number of neurons later in life. He says too much early activity in the amygdala also could produce abnormal fears, which might be an explanation for some of the other problems associated with autism. Dr. AMARAL: If you have abnormal fears, how would that contribute, for example, to the development of normal social behavior or to the development of other, you know, learning and memory and other areas? HAMILTON: Amaral says scientists are a long way from knowing, in part because the number of brains they've studied from people with autism is still only in the dozens. Dr. AMARAL: By contrast, if you think of something like Alzheimer's Disease, probably tens of thousands of brains have been looked at. And it's pretty clear now where the pathology starts in Alzheimer's and what it looks like and what brain regions are involved. We're still in pretty early stages of trying to establish the pathology of autism. HAMILTON: That may be changing. An autism research group has recently set up a system to encourage the donation of brain tissue from people with autism. Amaral's study is among the first to take advantage of that system.

I'm Ira Flatow. It's almost a certainty that if you're listening to this program now you're using tiny electronic devices that can trace their heritage back to the mind of William Shockley. He shared a Nobel Prize with John Bardeen and Walter Brattain for the invention of the transistor and later went on to refine transistor technology, spawning the modern age of semiconductors and of Silicon Valley. But he also managed to alienate many of his coworkers and later went on to be a proponent of ugly ideas about race, intelligence and eugenics. Joining me now is writer Joel Shurkin. He's author of the book, Broken Genius: The Rise and Fall of William Shockley, Creator of the Electronic Age, recently published by Palgrave Macmillan. He joins us from our NPR studios in Washington. Good to talk with you, Joel. Mr. JOEL SHURKIN (Author, Broken Genius: The Rise and Fall of William Shockley, Creator of the Electronic Age): Hi, (unintelligible), how are you? FLATOW: How are you? Mr. SHURKIN: I'm doing fine. FLATOW: So - that's great. Tell us who, for people who don't know, you know, the history of William Shockley and the transistor, give us a little thumbnail sketch of his involvement with it. Mr. SHURKIN: Well, he was a team leader at Bell Labs in the mid-1940s. The AT&T - better known as Ma Bell - was trying to find a technology for telephony that replaced the vacuum tube, and they were going to employ solid-state physics to do it. Shockley was the team leader, and Brattain and Bardeen worked for him. And they did it, not without some fuss, though. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Did they do it, his two collaborators, or did Shockley have a whole lot of input into that, also? Mr. SHURKIN: Well, that's a really good question and somewhat controversial. The answer is yes, they did it. However, there's actually two transistors. There's the junction transistor and a point-contact transistor. The very first transistor was the point-contact transistor, and that was Bardeen and Brattain. Shockley, in an absolute fury because he had been aced by his own team, went into a hotel room in Chicago and in several furious days produced what became the junction transistor. The transistor that you and I use, the zillions of them surrounding us right now. . . FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Mr. SHURKIN: . . . descend from Shockley's junction transistor. FLATOW: But I - you write in your book that his name was not even on the original patent for the transistor, if I read that correct. Mr. SHURKIN: That's correct. It was not. It was on the second patent, the patent for the junction transistor. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Mr. SHURKIN: People are still talking about that now. FLATOW: Yeah, there is a - and about him, what kind of guy was he? Mr. SHURKIN: Ha. (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: That's what your whole book is about. Mr. SHURKIN: He was a perfectly miserable son of a gun. (Soundbite of laughter) How he was miserable is more complicated than even I could get into a hundred thousand word book. There was something wrong with him. What was wrong with him, we don't really know. He was at best paranoid. He was probably obsessive-compulsive. The manuscript of the book has been shown to about six or seven psychotherapist, and I asked them for a diagnosis, and they came back with six or seven different diagnoses. FLATOW: Hmm. Mr. SHURKIN: But very clearly, some of his wires were not attached properly. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. He was that point-contact transistor type. Mr. SHURKIN: Indeed. FLATOW: And he left - he - so he gets a - he gets the Nobel Prize, correct? Mr. SHURKIN: He shared the Nobel. . . FLATOW: Or shared the Nobel Prize. . . Mr. SHURKIN: Correct. FLATOW: . . . for the transistor, and he then leaves Bell Labs. Mr. SHURKIN: Yes, he does. He decided he was going to be the first entrepreneur of the electronic age, and indeed he was. With backing from a man named Arnold Beckman, he founded Shockley Semiconductor in Palo Alto and he was going to build - at least at first he was going to build silicon transistors. It was his decision that they use silicon as opposed to germanium, otherwise we'd be talking about Germanium Valley out there instead of Silicon Valley. (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: That's right, yeah. Mr. SHURKIN: He had this enormous talent of picking geniuses, of exceptionably bright people to work for him, and it took him about a year and half to screw it up. FLATOW: Just a year and half he alienated these people, some names that we would know in the history of. . . Mr. SHURKIN: Gordon Moore, Robert Noyce. FLATOW: The Intel people, right. Mr. SHURKIN: Yes. Correct. FLATOW: Who later went on to found Intel. And so he had a whole bunch of people he - that worked for him and he alienated them in 18 months. Mr. SHURKIN: Actually, he alienated them in less than that. (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. SHURKIN: It was almost an instantaneous dislike. Shockley was once described as having reverse - oh, missed on a word, but. . . FLATOW: Mm-hmm, well, what - he. . . Mr. SHURKIN: I'll get it. FLATOW: Was he a bad manager? I mean, that he didn't know how to manage projects, or he just didn't. . . Mr. SHURKIN: He may have been. . . FLATOW: . . . he just rubbed people the wrong way? Mr. SHURKIN: Yes, on both counts. FLATOW: Yeah. Mr. SHURKIN: He may have been the worst manager in the history of electronics. He thought - he had studied through the years, very bright people - how very bright people worked, how you manage very bright people - and then managed to ignore everything he learned. FLATOW: How? Mr. SHURKIN: He was paranoid. He was afraid that he hired people who were at least as smart as he was and that they were going to do better things than he could do, as Bardeen and Brattain had done at Bell Labs. FLATOW: Right. I'm talking with Joel Shurkin, author of the book, Broken Genius: The Rise and Fall of William Shockley, Creator of the Electronic Age, just out. 1-800-989-8255 is our number. So he hires all - all these people come to join him. They get upset with his management style. They leave, and do they go off and form their own company? Mr. SHURKIN: They do. They form something called Fairchild Semiconductor, which only lasted for about two years. And then they quit again and went out -because they decided they could get filthy rich on their own - and founded Intel. FLATOW: Hmm. And so what happens to Shockley in the meantime? Mr. SHURKIN: Shockley had decided he was going to change technologies. He was going to do something that was called the Shockley diode, which had virtually no market whatsoever. That was one of the fights he had with Noyce. His company, to the best of anyone's knowledge, never earned a penny in profit and disappeared within four or five years; just sank. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. And later in life, we know that the notorious history of him. He pretty much abandoned semiconductors, right, and became interested in the brain and race and intelligence and things like that. Mr. SHURKIN: That's correct. He was a eugenicist. He believed in eugenics, which essentially is that all the people - all the brighter people are reproducing at a slower rate than the not-bright people, or the worthy people are producing less quickly than the unworthy people, which he called dysgenics; in other words, evolution backwards. The problem with eugenics, which may or may not have any firm basis in reality, is that you almost cannot mention the word eugenics without mentioning the word Nazi in the next sentence because it was the basis for the Nazi's program. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Was there any one thing, Joel, you think that sent him over the edge - that was there an event in his life, perhaps? Mr. SHURKIN: Yeah, well, that's a matter of considerable debate. One of his best friends said that Shockley and his wife were in an automobile accident in 1960, and Shockley, in fact, hit his head on a windshield. He blames it on that. I think it was far more complicated than that. It may very well have gone back to the telephone call that Bardeen and Brattain had made when they told him that they had come up with a - they had the transistor effect in the laboratory. I think, in fact, there was not one event. I think he was simply sliding off into whatever mental state he wound up with, but I think it was in there all the time. His mother was pretty weird too. FLATOW: Mm-hmm, 1-800-989-8255. Let's go to Matt in Baldwin City, Kansas. Hi, Matt. MATT (Caller): Hey, hi, Ira. I didn't - that comment about how he had pluses and negatives was not lost on me. (Soundbite of laughter) MATT: Positive and negative, yeah, anyway. FLATOW: All right. MATT: I'm actually a sculptor, and I'm sitting here working on a sculpture of Jack Kilby\u2026 Mr. SHURKIN: Mm-hmm. MATT: . . . who was involved with the microchip. And I was wondering did Shockley, you know, did he ever have any - was there any involvement by Jack Kilby in this work? Mr. SHURKIN: There was not with Shockley. Shockley was out of it by the time Kilby came up with the microprocessor. Kilby. . . MATT: Uh-huh. Mr. SHURKIN: I'm sorry. MATT: Yeah, because part of the question is - I mean, the way it's presented to us around here is that Jack Kilby was the inventor of the microchip and - but there was another man named Robert Noyce, I think, who was involved with this. Mr. SHURKIN: It was a co-invention. They both did it independently in separate places. In fact, again, two separate inventions, and the microchip that we use now was Noyce's work as opposed to Kilby, although Kilby finally won a Nobel Prize, which he roundly deserved. MATT: Very interesting. Mr. SHURKIN: So they're co-inventors. MATT: Okay. FLATOW: All right, Matt. MATT: Yeah. All right, well, thanks very much. FLATOW: Have a good weekend. MATT: You, too. Bye. FLATOW: Thanks for calling. Bye. 1-800-989-8255. If he were around today, Joel, do you think he would act any differently or you know. . . Mr. SHURKIN: Oh, no. He - this was in his soul. I read it as if it was Greek tragedy without redemption at the end. He was simply destined to fail almost from the very beginning. You have to keep in mind that he was seriously one of the brightest people who ever walked the planet during the 20th century. He was extraordinarily smart. He had been raised in a family in which he had virtually no contact with children as he was growing up and had no contact with adults outside of this very restricted field that he was in. I mean, he hung around physicists and almost nobody else. I think he was simply doomed to fail. It's hard to imagine anybody failing quite as spectacularly as he did. We mentioned that he started Silicon Valley. He didn't make a dime out of Silicon Valley. Noyce and Gordon Moore and people like Jobs and Gates made a fortune out of the stuff that he started. And to the best of my knowledge he made no money out of it whatsoever. He lived - they lived his dream. FLATOW: That's the tragedy. Mr. SHURKIN: That's the tragedy. FLATOW: If he had stayed at Bell Labs, do you think things might have changed differently, or was it in his constitution not to be able to stay? Mr. SHURKIN: It was in his constitution not to be able to stay. He was sure that he would succeed. He was sure that he would hire all the right people to help him succeed, which was true, and that he knew how to manage those people, which was not true. The word I was looking for before was reverse charisma. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Mr. SHURKIN: He would walk into a room and you would instantly dislike him. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. In your research, did you get the impression that he - you seemed to imply it before but I want to ask it more directly - that he was truly mentally ill? Mr. SHURKIN: Well, yes, I just don't know. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Mr. SHURKIN: Again, I showed this manuscript to six or seven people and came up with six or seven different answers. Obviously, he was not normal. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Mr. SHURKIN: Part of that has to do with his genius, I am sure. Part of it has to do with his inabilities to deal with other humans. He was one of the most insensitive louts you could ever possibly imagine. But whether he learned that or whether he was born with that, I have absolutely no clue. FLATOW: Let's go to Cathy(ph) in St. Augustine, Florida. Hi, Cathy. CATHY (Caller): Hi. How are you today? FLATOW: Fine. How are you? CATHY: I was telling your staff I was a very junior little staffer at Stanford Electronic Labs in 1970. And he was there. And I'm just - I was - you know, it makes sense hearing your guest talk about his behavior. I didn't have that insight at the time. And he was a terrifying figure. And I guess that's helped most (unintelligible) sympathy for his wife, who was much long suffering little step-and-fetch-it kind of (unintelligible) always following behind making nice for the messes that he would create. (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: Okay. Thanks for that personal input. CATHY: Okay. Mr. SHURKIN: His wife was the reason why this book got written, actually. She wanted it done very, very badly. She turned over all of the family archives to me. And I actually moved into her house. FLATOW: Wow. Because she wanted to do what? Mr. SHURKIN: She was his last defender. She was his lover. She was his friend. She was his colleague. She was his soldier, his secretary, and his doormat, for all practical purposes. She wanted desperately to have a book written - a biography written of him. I could not possibly have done this without her. I owe her a great deal. And she did literally let me move into the house; I moved into his office. FLATOW: But you did - but the book you came up with I'm sure is not the kind of book she thought was going to happen. Mr. SHURKIN: I'm waiting for the telephone call. FLATOW: I mean, because if she gave you these documents and she was his biggest defender, it's almost - to me it says, I want you - if you knew the Shockley I knew, you would love him as much as I did. Mr. SHURKIN: Correct. Well, I know him at least as well as she does and I didn't love him very much. (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. SHURKIN: I did admire him, however. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Mr. SHURKIN: What she thinks of the book, I don't know. Again, I'm waiting for the telephone call because I certainly did send her a copy of it. FLATOW: Talking with Joel Shurkin, author of, Broken Genius: The Rise and Fall of William Shockley, Creator of the Electronic Age, published by Palgrave Macmillan on TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. Lots of folks want to talk about Shockley. Let's go to Deborah(ph) in Summerville, South Carolina. Hi, Deborah. DEBORAH (Caller): Hi. How are you? FLATOW: Fine. DEBORAH: I would like to know about William Shockley's three children from his first marriage. How are they and what are they doing and are they as bright as their father? FLATOW: Did you know the Shockleys? DEBORAH: Yes. I lived down the street from them. And my father actually worked in Whippany with Shockley. And then my dad went over to Bell Labs in Murray Hill. Mr. SHURKIN: The answer to your question is the children - he has a daughter. . . DEBORAH: Yes. Mr. SHURKIN: . . . and two sons. DEBORAH: Right. Mr. SHURKIN: The daughter is Allison, who was also very helpful with the book. She is married and lived here in Silver Springs but she's since moved to Virginia, not quite sure where. Two sons, one of them was a physicist with a degree from Stanford, and the other one is in Los Angeles and I don't remember what he did. There's a different - they had a different relationship. Allison was much older than her older brother. And she had a different relationship with him than her brothers did. The brothers are not terribly fond of their father. DEBORAH: Mm-hmm. Yes. Mr. SHURKIN: They even dislike their mother more for reasons that I actually never figured out. But they did not - they're not like the old man at all and had a whole different relationship with them. It's entirely possible that he was sliding into whatever mental state he was sliding into at the time and they were the victims of it. DEBORAH: Right. FLATOW: All right, Deborah. Thanks for calling. DEBORAH: You're welcome. Bye bye. FLATOW: Bye bye. You know, if you can make a movie called, The Beautiful Mind, I think this is another movie, Joel. I mean. . . Mr. SHURKIN: I agree except that there is no redemption at the end. He died alone, in pain of prostrate cancer. Emmy, his wife, was at his side. And she had a memorial service - a one-person memorial service. She showed up. His body was cremated. And one of the reasons I think was if they held a real service, nobody would come. So it's very hard to have a movie without any redemption at the end of it. In fact, we have - I think we have sold an option for it, so someone's going to try and do it. FLATOW: Huh. I mean, that's just terrible to say things, you know, about somebody like that - that there's absolutely no - I'm not criticizing you. I'm just saying what an awful life that you've uncovered that there's no redemption. Mr. SHURKIN: He would. . . FLATOW: Maybe even the transistor is not his redemption, pardon (unintelligible). Mr. SHURKIN: No, because this - this interested me. He became so detested because of his eugenics theories and his obsession with eugenics theories. He could talk about nothing else. You could not have a conversation about the weather, baseball, or anything else. That's all he wanted to talk about, even to his children. By the way, one of his sons didn't see him for the last 20 years of his life. By the time he was done, he had alienated all of his friends. The problem that I had as a biographer was that he was so detested that people's memory were altered. I was told repeatedly that nudge, nudge, wink, wink, he did not really invent the junction transistor. Well, he did. It got to the point where I started distrusting what people were telling me and how to rely on the written documents, which, as a journalist, I've never had to do before. People were telling me things that I knew were not true but that they fervently believed to be true. And it wasn't his - that's how detested he was. FLATOW: Wow. So did you find yourself changing your opinions as you went through the research and the writing? Mr. SHURKIN: Yes, because, again, it was his brilliance. There are several stories about him that nobody knows or didn't know until I wrote the book, which is saying he was something of a war hero. He invented operations research, and he may have saved thousands upon thousands of lives without ever leaving his desk, such things as how to hunt down the German submarines or how to avoid German anti-submarine - how to avoid German planes when you're on a convoy across the Atlantic. He did many of those things. And then he was responsible to a large extent for the team inventing the transistor. It's what happened afterwards that was a surprise. And again, it was right out of Sophocles. FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Joel, I want to thank you for taking time to talk with us. Mr. SHURKIN: My pleasure. FLATOW:  And an old friend of mine. Good luck, good luck to you. Joel Shurkin, author of the book, Broken Genius: The Rise and Fall of William Shockley, Creator of the Electronic Age, recently published by Palgrave Macmillan. We'll watch for the movie, Joel. Thanks, sir, for talking with us. We're going to take a short break. When we come back we're going to switch gears again and talk about the 30th anniversary of the Martian lander, the Viking, landing on Mars 30 years ago this week. It was an exciting time back then. We'll talk about maybe exciting days to come with other missions. Stay with us. We'll be right back. (Soundbite of music) FLATOW: I'm Ira Flatow. This is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.  IRA FLATOW, host:  You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow.  It's almost a certainty that if you're listening to this program now you're using tiny electronic devices that can trace their heritage back to the mind of William Shockley. He shared a Nobel Prize with John Bardeen and Walter Brattain for the invention of the transistor and later went on to refine transistor technology, spawning the modern age of semiconductors and of Silicon Valley. But he also managed to alienate many of his coworkers and later went on to be a proponent of ugly ideas about race, intelligence and eugenics.  Joining me now is writer Joel Shurkin. He's author of the book, Broken Genius: The Rise and Fall of William Shockley, Creator of the Electronic Age, recently published by Palgrave Macmillan. He joins us from our NPR studios in Washington. Good to talk with you, Joel.  Mr. JOEL SHURKIN (Author, Broken Genius: The Rise and Fall of William Shockley, Creator of the Electronic Age): Hi, (unintelligible), how are you?  FLATOW: How are you?

He was one of the most insensitive louts you could ever possibly imagine. But whether he learned that or whether he was born with that, I have absolutely no clue.  FLATOW: Let's go to Cathy(ph) in St. Augustine, Florida. Hi, Cathy.  CATHY (Caller): Hi. How are you today?  FLATOW: Fine. How are you?  CATHY: I was telling your staff I was a very junior little staffer at Stanford Electronic Labs in 1970. And he was there. And I'm just - I was - you know, it makes sense hearing your guest talk about his behavior.  I didn't have that insight at the time. And he was a terrifying figure. And I guess that's helped most (unintelligible) sympathy for his wife, who was much long suffering little step-and-fetch-it kind of (unintelligible) always following behind making nice for the messes that he would create.  (Soundbite of laughter)  FLATOW: Okay. Thanks for that personal input.  CATHY: Okay.  Mr. SHURKIN: His wife was the reason why this book got written, actually. She wanted it done very, very badly. She turned over all of the family archives to me. And I actually moved into her house.  FLATOW: Wow. Because she wanted to do what?  Mr. SHURKIN: She was his last defender. She was his lover. She was his friend. She was his colleague. She was his soldier, his secretary, and his doormat, for all practical purposes.  She wanted desperately to have a book written - a biography written of him. I could not possibly have done this without her. I owe her a great deal. And she did literally let me move into the house; I moved into his office.  FLATOW: But you did - but the book you came up with I'm sure is not the kind of book she thought was going to happen.  Mr. SHURKIN: I'm waiting for the telephone call.  FLATOW: I mean, because if she gave you these documents and she was his biggest defender, it's almost - to me it says, I want you - if you knew the Shockley I knew, you would love him as much as I did.  Mr. SHURKIN: Correct. Well, I know him at least as well as she does and I didn't love him very much.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Mr. SHURKIN: I did admire him, however.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm.  Mr. SHURKIN: What she thinks of the book, I don't know. Again, I'm waiting for the telephone call because I certainly did send her a copy of it.  FLATOW: Talking with Joel Shurkin, author of, Broken Genius: The Rise and Fall of William Shockley, Creator of the Electronic Age, published by Palgrave Macmillan on TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.  Lots of folks want to talk about Shockley. Let's go to Deborah(ph) in Summerville, South Carolina. Hi, Deborah.  DEBORAH (Caller): Hi. How are you?  FLATOW: Fine.  DEBORAH: I would like to know about William Shockley's three children from his first marriage. How are they and what are they doing and are they as bright as their father?  FLATOW: Did you know the Shockleys?  DEBORAH: Yes. I lived down the street from them. And my father actually worked in Whippany with Shockley. And then my dad went over to Bell Labs in Murray Hill.  Mr. SHURKIN: The answer to your question is the children - he has a daughter. . .  DEBORAH: Yes.  Mr. SHURKIN: . . . and two sons.  DEBORAH: Right.  Mr. SHURKIN: The daughter is Allison, who was also very helpful with the book. She is married and lived here in Silver Springs but she's since moved to Virginia, not quite sure where. Two sons, one of them was a physicist with a degree from Stanford, and the other one is in Los Angeles and I don't remember what he did.  There's a different - they had a different relationship. Allison was much older than her older brother. And she had a different relationship with him than her brothers did. The brothers are not terribly fond of their father.  DEBORAH: Mm-hmm. Yes.  Mr. SHURKIN: They even dislike their mother more for reasons that I actually never figured out. But they did not - they're not like the old man at all and had a whole different relationship with them. It's entirely possible that he was sliding into whatever mental state he was sliding into at the time and they were the victims of it.  DEBORAH: Right.  FLATOW: All right, Deborah. Thanks for calling.  DEBORAH: You're welcome. Bye bye.  FLATOW: Bye bye. You know, if you can make a movie called, The Beautiful Mind, I think this is another movie, Joel. I mean. . .  Mr. SHURKIN: I agree except that there is no redemption at the end. He died alone, in pain of prostrate cancer. Emmy, his wife, was at his side. And she had a memorial service - a one-person memorial service. She showed up. His body was cremated.  And one of the reasons I think was if they held a real service, nobody would come. So it's very hard to have a movie without any redemption at the end of it.  In fact, we have - I think we have sold an option for it, so someone's going to try and do it.  FLATOW: Huh. I mean, that's just terrible to say things, you know, about somebody like that - that there's absolutely no - I'm not criticizing you. I'm just saying what an awful life that you've uncovered that there's no redemption.  Mr. SHURKIN: He would. . .  FLATOW: Maybe even the transistor is not his redemption, pardon (unintelligible).  Mr. SHURKIN: No, because this - this interested me. He became so detested because of his eugenics theories and his obsession with eugenics theories. He could talk about nothing else. You could not have a conversation about the weather, baseball, or anything else. That's all he wanted to talk about, even to his children.  By the way, one of his sons didn't see him for the last 20 years of his life. By the time he was done, he had alienated all of his friends. The problem that I had as a biographer was that he was so detested that people's memory were altered.  I was told repeatedly that nudge, nudge, wink, wink, he did not really invent the junction transistor. Well, he did. It got to the point where I started distrusting what people were telling me and how to rely on the written documents, which, as a journalist, I've never had to do before.  People were telling me things that I knew were not true but that they fervently believed to be true. And it wasn't his - that's how detested he was.  FLATOW: Wow. So did you find yourself changing your opinions as you went through the research and the writing?  Mr. SHURKIN: Yes, because, again, it was his brilliance. There are several stories about him that nobody knows or didn't know until I wrote the book, which is saying he was something of a war hero. He invented operations research, and he may have saved thousands upon thousands of lives without ever leaving his desk, such things as how to hunt down the German submarines or how to avoid German anti-submarine - how to avoid German planes when you're on a convoy across the Atlantic.  He did many of those things. And then he was responsible to a large extent for the team inventing the transistor. It's what happened afterwards that was a surprise. And again, it was right out of Sophocles.  FLATOW: Mm-hmm. Joel, I want to thank you for taking time to talk with us.  Mr. SHURKIN: My pleasure.  FLATOW:  And an old friend of mine. Good luck, good luck to you. Joel Shurkin, author of the book, Broken Genius: The Rise and Fall of William Shockley, Creator of the Electronic Age, recently published by Palgrave Macmillan.  We'll watch for the movie, Joel. Thanks, sir, for talking with us. We're going to take a short break. When we come back we're going to switch gears again and talk about the 30th anniversary of the Martian lander, the Viking, landing on Mars 30 years ago this week. It was an exciting time back then. We'll talk about maybe exciting days to come with other missions.  Stay with us. We'll be right back.  (Soundbite of music)  FLATOW: I'm Ira Flatow.

I'm Ira Flatow. Now that President Bush has vetoed a crucial stem cell bill, what does the future hold?  Will stem cell research be on the mind of voters this fall?  We'll talk about it. We'll also talk about the quite but steady growth of wind energy. From Kansas to New York, Texas to Washington, wind farms are sprouting up across America, giving farmers substantial income they can't get from crops. We'll also talk with the Sierra Club about why it's suing Donald Rumsfeld, charging that the Department of Defense is holding up plans to build hundreds of new wind turbans around the country. It's all coming up after this break. Stay with us. (Soundbite of music) (Soundbite of news) FLATOW: This is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I am Ira Flatow. This week, President Bush used his veto power for the first time to kill a bill that would have eased restrictions he had placed back in 2001. Restrictions on scientists working with stem cells made from human embryos. Right now, researchers who use federal funding can work only with stem cell colonies, or lines, as they're called - only work with them - those that were created before August 9th, 2001. But less than two dozen, say the researchers, are useful. The new bill would have opened up many more lines of embryonic stem cells by allowing researchers funded by U. S. taxpayers to work with lines made from human embryos that fertility clinics are planning to throw away. We know from polling that the public, Republican and Democrat alike, is in favor of stem cell research, mostly because of its potential to help fight disease. So where does that leave the future of embryonic stem cell research? Sean Tipton is an administrator of public affairs for the Society for Reproductive Health. He's also president of the Coalition for the Advancement of Medical Research, and that coalition advocates stem cell research. Some stem cell researchers say they're bitter about the president's veto but Mr. Tipton's not discouraged. He is already planning his next move. He joins us today from our studios in Washington. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. Mr. SEAN TIPTON: (President, Coalition for the Advancement of Medical Research): Good afternoon, Ira. FLATOW: Welcome back. Matt Stearns is a reporter who's been covering stem cells as a political issue. He's Washington correspondent for the Kansas City Star and McClatchy Newspapers. He's been covering the Senate race in Missouri, and in some states Republican and Democratic candidates seem to be trying to outdo each other in their support for stem cells. We'll find out if that's going on in Missouri, a state that also has a stem cell initiative on the ballot in November. If that initiative passes, it would mean that the State of Missouri could use its own funds to underwrite stem cell research. Matt Stearns's also at our NPR studios in Washington. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. Mr. MATT STEARNS (Washington Correspondent, McClatchy Newspapers/Kansas City Star): Thank you Ira. FLATOW: Let me ask you, Sean. First of all, you're not disappointed in the outcome of this vote? Mr. TIPTON: Well, of course we would have liked to have changed the policy. We're not happy that the president opted to go against the majority in the House and the majority in the Senate and a majority of the American people and veto this bill. Nevertheless, I think we showed just how strong support for this kind of research is and we will fight on and the researchers will work on under the limitations that are there. So it turns out it's not a terrible week for stem cell research. We've seen, since Wednesday, that in California and in Illinois their governors are moving ahead with funding for embryonic stem cell research. So we're going to move forward on this. FLATOW: In fact, there is a lot of private research going on in private corporations with stem cell research. Mr. TIPTON: Well, there is private research and unfortunately, it's difficult to quantify and to oversee that. I think one of the real reasons to support federal funding for embryonic stem cell research is because that work is going to be done with the best scientific and ethical oversight. In the private sector, it's sort of left to what the private companies choose to do. FLATOW: Mm hmm. Matt Stearns, let's talk about how this is filtering down now to the state level. Sean talked about it a bit. Let's talk about the Missouri senate race. How does stem cells figure in that? Mr. STEARNS: Well, stem cells are really inseparable from the Missouri senate race at this point in time because we have a state ballot initiative that basically would protect stem cell research in Missouri by making sure that if it's legal at the federal level then it's legal in Missouri. What you in the senate race is a Republican incumbent, Jim Talent, who is a social conservative who has opposed types of embryonic stem cell research and is opposed to the ballot imitative. On the Democratic side, you have an aggressive challenger in Claire McCaskill, who has embraced the stem cell initiative in Missouri, and has really been put front and center by the National Democratic Party in the last week, as the face of the Democrats who supports what polls show the majority of the American people support and polls show the majority of the people in Missouri support, which has increased stem cell research, including embryonic stem cell research. FLATOW: So Jim Talent found himself on the wrong side of the ledger on this one. Mr. STEARNS: Jim Talent - it's too soon to tell because in Missouri there's a very strong conservative base. And if the strong conservative base is motivated to come out to vote against the ballot initiative then they may well also come to support Jim Talent. However, he has sort of taken a muddied approach, which has hurt him with the base. He abandoned his support - his long four-year support - of a very restrictive stem cell bill, which was called a flip-flop by one of the strong right-to-life organizations in Missouri. And at the same time, he's tried to repair that breech by coming out against the ballot initiative in Missouri. So, he's not necessarily on the wrong side of the ledger if he can repair the breech with his base that happened when he abandoned the bill that would have been very restrictive. FLATOW: Mm hmm. And then the conservative base is what this vote is all about - or the veto is all about - is it not? The presidential veto. Mr. STEARNS: That's absolutely right. It's a very difficult environment for Republican candidates this year and the Republicans are trying to motivate their base by strutting their stuff on a lot of conservative issues. You've seen votes in congress recently on the flag amendment, on gay marriage, and the stem cell veto plays right into that. But some moderate Republicans are very worried because they say you can't win elections with just the base. And they're concerned that by motivating the base with an issue that resonates so powerfully among the majority of Americans, that they'll alienate swing voters in the process. FLATOW: Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mr. STEARNS: And that doesn't really add up to 51 percent. FLATOW: Sean Tipton, where does the future of embryonic stem cell research go from here?  Is this just a slight nick in the future or is it a big wound? Mr. TIPTON: Well, I think it is difficult. You know, so many patients have been working so hard advocating for themselves and others to advance this research and they certainly were dealt a serious blow by the president this week. I mean, I have had a patient from Minnesota with Parkinson's Disease who called me this week and said Sean, I don't know of I can hold on for two more years. So, I think it's going to be hard for them. I think for those of us who are in this for the long haul, we recognize that we scored a significant political win this week. Having the kind of margins that we got in the House and in the Senate shows exactly where the people are and their elected representatives are. So, I think we're optimistic that we did move the political ball forward. Unfortunately, we didn't move the policy ball forward as much as we would have liked. And so, America's scientists are going to have to continue to muddle forward using suboptimal research equipment and supplies. Fortunately, there are some private and philanthropic funding sources available and international funds, which are going to move the research forward, but it's not going to move forward nearly as quickly as it would with full federal support. FLATOW: On the other hand, you have people, you know, looking at the hundreds of millions of dollars that California - you know, the bond issue that was raised there for stem cell research - saying that's plenty of money. You know?  Are there other states that are also raising money? Mr. TIPTON: You know, science is a global enterprise, and I for one, would rather have our scientists in the laboratory doing the work they do best - doing the research - instead of having to chase down funds and figure out which bureaucracy requires how many copies of which form, and that's what we're going to have if we rely on the states and other entities to fund this work. This country has built the world's greatest biomedical research enterprise, using the National Institutes of Health as a funding source - and one that all the academic scientists know how to work with, and it works efficiently and it works well - and we think it ought to be able to get to work with the best embryonic stem cell lines. FLATOW: Mm hmm. Do we think, Matt - and I'll ask Sean also - do we think that, besides the Missouri race, that there will be other races that will, you know, that the Democrats have something now to use against the Republicans or at least in running against the White House? Mr. STEARNS: Thank you, Ira. The Democrats would love this to be as big an issue in every state as it is in Missouri because they look at the polling that says two-thirds of people support more embryonic stem cell research. You're starting to see a popup. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee put out a press release the day the president vetoed the bill, which had virtually every major Democratic Senate candidate quoted as saying, you know, they would have voted to override the veto and damning their opponents for supporting the president. In Maryland, we have a Republican candidate named Michael Steele, who Republicans have high hopes for in a traditionally Democratic state. He, several weeks ago, compared stem cell research to the Holocaust while speaking to a Jewish group, and that's not the kind of mistake you can make when you're already a Republican running in a generally Democratic state where that state's polls also show great support among the people. Pennsylvania is an interesting state, too. Rick Santorum is a staunch social conservative in some trouble. Bob Casey, the Democratic candidate, is a pro-life Democrat, and I don't think he's come out and said where he is yet on stem cell research, but I'm told by some moderate Republicans that they fear greatly that Bob Casey will come out in support of more embryonic stem cell research and drive even more of a wedge between moderate Republicans in that state and Senator Santorum. FLATOW: Sean, you agree? Mr. TIPTON: Yeah, I think that's right. I can tell you that even though our coalition does not get involved directly in electoral issues, I've been hearing all week from candidates and from campaign consultants who want to know more about the issue or want our endorsement, even though we're not going to be able to help them in that specific way. So I think people who can count votes see this as a very hot issue. FLATOW: Is there any chance this might come up again in some form, in Congress? Mr. TIPTON: I think in the 109th Congress that is unlikely, but I feel confident that when the 110th Congress convenes in January, that it's going to be a very hot issue. And who knows what the makeup of that Congress may be and what role stem cells may have contributed to that makeup. FLATOW: Mm hmm. And people watch the other countries around the world are continuing with their stem cell research, while we fall behind it. Mr. TIPTON: Clearly a number of countries are working - the United Kingdom, Israel, Singapore, for example. And again, I think we have built the world's greatest biomedical research enterprise, and we're going to tell our best scientists they're going to have to sit out what may be the most promising piece of biomedical research in the 21st century, and I think that's an unfortunate policy choice. FLATOW: You know, we talk about energy, we talk about the states having, you know, - we'll be talking later today about wind energy - that the states are taking over alternative energies. It just seems to be that the states are taking up issues - and now here, with stem cell research - that the federal government is just not addressing, or is not putting any more money into. Mr. TIPTON: I think there's a great deal of frustration amongst the American people and their elected representatives, be those representatives in their statehouses or in Washington, with the current federal policy and there's a desire to change. And I think we're going to continue to see leaders in every state try to move embryonic stem cell research forward and fill this vacuum that the federal government is leaving. FLATOW: Mm hmm. Mr. TIPTON: Also, it appears to be a salient political issue. I mean, it would not surprise me to see county counsel candidates or candidates for sheriff trying to talk about stem cell research. If it's a winning issue, they're going to get on that side of it. FLATOW: Certainly if it would bring money into the coffers of those places, too, if they were available. Mr. TIPTON: Well, in the states, it certainly has been the economic development argument, and the idea that states that want to have a successful biotech industry will have to get behind this, has been very important. Mr. STEARNS: That's actually true in Missouri. Specifically, the Stowers Institute for Medical Research in Kansas City has a $2 billion endowment. They have put the hold on that $300 million. . . (Soundbite of music) FLATOW: Matt, I'm going to have - we'll pick that up when we have you on next time. Matt Stearns, Kansas City Star. Sean Tipton, president of the Coalition for the Advancement of Medical Science. Thank you both for taking time to talk with us today. We're going to take a break. Come back, switch gears.

He, several weeks ago, compared stem cell research to the Holocaust while speaking to a Jewish group, and that's not the kind of mistake you can make when you're already a Republican running in a generally Democratic state where that state's polls also show great support among the people.  Pennsylvania is an interesting state, too. Rick Santorum is a staunch social conservative in some trouble. Bob Casey, the Democratic candidate, is a pro-life Democrat, and I don't think he's come out and said where he is yet on stem cell research, but I'm told by some moderate Republicans that they fear greatly that Bob Casey will come out in support of more embryonic stem cell research and drive even more of a wedge between moderate Republicans in that state and Senator Santorum.  FLATOW: Sean, you agree?  Mr. TIPTON: Yeah, I think that's right. I can tell you that even though our coalition does not get involved directly in electoral issues, I've been hearing all week from candidates and from campaign consultants who want to know more about the issue or want our endorsement, even though we're not going to be able to help them in that specific way. So I think people who can count votes see this as a very hot issue.  FLATOW: Is there any chance this might come up again in some form, in Congress?  Mr. TIPTON: I think in the 109th Congress that is unlikely, but I feel confident that when the 110th Congress convenes in January, that it's going to be a very hot issue. And who knows what the makeup of that Congress may be and what role stem cells may have contributed to that makeup.  FLATOW: Mm hmm. And people watch the other countries around the world are continuing with their stem cell research, while we fall behind it.  Mr. TIPTON: Clearly a number of countries are working - the United Kingdom, Israel, Singapore, for example. And again, I think we have built the world's greatest biomedical research enterprise, and we're going to tell our best scientists they're going to have to sit out what may be the most promising piece of biomedical research in the 21st century, and I think that's an unfortunate policy choice.  FLATOW: You know, we talk about energy, we talk about the states having, you know, - we'll be talking later today about wind energy - that the states are taking over alternative energies. It just seems to be that the states are taking up issues - and now here, with stem cell research - that the federal government is just not addressing, or is not putting any more money into.  Mr. TIPTON: I think there's a great deal of frustration amongst the American people and their elected representatives, be those representatives in their statehouses or in Washington, with the current federal policy and there's a desire to change. And I think we're going to continue to see leaders in every state try to move embryonic stem cell research forward and fill this vacuum that the federal government is leaving.  FLATOW: Mm hmm.  Mr. TIPTON: Also, it appears to be a salient political issue. I mean, it would not surprise me to see county counsel candidates or candidates for sheriff trying to talk about stem cell research. If it's a winning issue, they're going to get on that side of it.  FLATOW: Certainly if it would bring money into the coffers of those places, too, if they were available.  Mr. TIPTON: Well, in the states, it certainly has been the economic development argument, and the idea that states that want to have a successful biotech industry will have to get behind this, has been very important.  Mr. STEARNS: That's actually true in Missouri. Specifically, the Stowers Institute for Medical Research in Kansas City has a $2 billion endowment. They have put the hold on that $300 million. . .  (Soundbite of music)  FLATOW: Matt, I'm going to have - we'll pick that up when we have you on next time. Matt Stearns, Kansas City Star. Sean Tipton, president of the Coalition for the Advancement of Medical Science. Thank you both for taking time to talk with us today. We're going to take a break. Come back, switch gears. Stay with us. We'll be right back after this short break. I'm Ira Flatow. This is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.

Over the summer we've been checking in on changing conditions in the Arctic. With advances in maritime technology, commercial shipping and fishing have increased the region, as well as, in recent years, tourism. The latest group of tourists made the journey to the North Pole aboard the Russian icebreaker, Yamal. Bob Headland is a senior associate of the Scott Polar Research Institute at the University of Cambridge. He was hired to give a series of lectures aboard the Yamal. We got him on the line yesterday as the icebreaker was beginning its journey home. Mr. ROBERT HEADLAND (Senior Associate, Scott Polar Research Institute, University of Cambridge): At this moment we're only a few kilometers from the North Pole. About half an hour ago, air compressors came on and the icebreaker is starting her work and we have only one choice in the matter, we are now heading south. MONTAGNE: And as you look back at where you've just been, why don't you describe it to us. Mr. HEADLAND: Well, in fact, looking directly out of the window from the radio room now, there's more mist and fog coming. It's bright. The visibility's only a few hundred meters, but we're making good progress. MONTAGNE: And how many trips have you taken to the Arctic? Mr. HEADLAND: This to the North Pole will actually be the 20th time I've been here. I first arrived in 1991. MONTAGNE: And you would know better than anyone how different that is - that you can, in a sense, just pop up there - compared to how it was for early explorers. Mr. HEADLAND: Oh, this is something that truly is fascinating. You can get all the theoretical material from the literature and hear what they've written, but to actually be here in practice and to the effort that it takes to get here, even now in the height of summer, it certainly gives you a good appreciation of the history. MONTAGNE: And now you are actually on what amounts to a tour ship. I mean, it's an expedition but people pay good money to go to the North Pole. Mr. HEADLAND: Yes, indeed. There is a shipload here of passengers who are very keen on it. It is expensive. The fuel, after all, is uranium. But this has meant that something that was previously obtainable with only the greatest of difficulty can be done, I'll say in relative luxury, because I emphasize this is by no means a luxurious tourist ship. She's a good working icebreaker adapted to carry passengers. MONTAGNE: Have any of the passengers or have you all working there on the ship been able to get off the ship and actually walk on the ice? Mr. HEADLAND: Yes, at the North Pole we arrived, stayed overnight, and just after breakfast went down to the ice. The ship had moved to a larger ice floe. There, indeed, we had an extremely pleasant barbeque lunch. At the stern of the vessel, I'd say about half the passengers and similar proportion of the crew actually dived in. MONTAGNE: Mr. Headland, you know this geography, you know the history of it, you know the climate. What do you think the future holds for the Arctic? Mr. HEADLAND: I think one will look at the Arctic becoming generally warmer, The thickness of the ice becoming less. Already the Russians operate the northeastern sea route as a major cargo and transshipment route. In North America, perhaps the Northwest Passage might have more cargo working on it. So this area will become more used. But the accessibility with improvement in technology on all icebreakers is getting more and more. It's quite amazing how we're talking so easily (unintelligible) satellite telephones. In the old days this would have been over radio and we'd be saying change all the time. MONTAGNE: Yeah, we'd be saying over. Mr. HEADLAND: Over (unintelligible) exactly. MONTAGNE: Well, I'll say to you, over and out just now. Thank you very much for joining us. Mr. HEADLAND: Thanks very much indeed. MONTAGNE: Bob Headland is a senior associate of the Scott Polar Research Institute, University of Cambridge.

I'm Noah Adams. Valeria Godines is a reporter for the Orange County Register, a newspaper here in Southern California. Nineteen years in journalism, she now covers Latino issues for the paper. And this summer she turned to a far more personal issue: her struggle with mental illness. She had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder.  She wrote a five-part series on being bipolar, with large headlines providing their narrative arc. Day One: On December 5th, 2004, I Killed My Daughter. That's what she imagined. Ending with Day Five: A Family Finds New Life After Months of Turmoil.  I spoke earlier with Valeria Godines at NPR West. So it turns out well in the end, but that first story was very scary, and it was on the front page. Ms. VALERIA GODINES (Reporter, Orange County Register): Yes, it was. You know, on December 5th, 2004, I went completely insane, psychotic. And I've had people ask me, what does psychotic mean. For me, it meant that I thought I was a hermaphrodite. I thought that my father-in-law was poisoning me. I thought I had murdered my daughter.  ADAMS: And, in fact, you were convinced and called the police and they came to get you. Ms. GODINES: Yes, called the police and they came to get me and they talked to me briefly, and luckily for us the police officer immediately knew what was wrong and he told my husband, you need to take her to the hospital right now. I had never laid a hand on Gabriella. ADAMS: The decision to make it a public story, what would be the motivation for that? Just to tell everything to - how many readers of the paper? Ms. GODINES: Three hundred, 350,000. A little more on Sunday. I think one obvious answer is, you know, I want to educate. But for me, I feel like I'm a storyteller and this was the biggest story of my life. And it's kind of like when I'm sitting next to somebody, I want to turn to them and say, you'll never believe what happened to me, this is this amazing story. ADAMS: You've been an editor as well as a reporter. D Ms. GODINES: Uh-huh. ADAMS: Did you agree, by the way, with the way the newspaper played the story: I Murdered My Daughter in big letters, and that turns out not to be true but just something that you. . . Ms. GODINES: Yeah. No, that's a really good point. We got some readers who were quite unset with that. One reader even she felt cheated that it actually hadn't happened. We had many discussions about that internally, and ultimately we decided that we wanted as closely as we could to have the reader experience the panic and the chaos and the fear that I felt, and this was one way to do it. ADAMS: To give us an idea of what your stories sound like in print, would you read a little bit about a woman that you met in the mental hospital, Barbara? Ms. GODINES: Sure.  Barbara wears mascara and red lipstick. She loves to sing Rod Stewart songs, snapping her fingers and bobbing her head while belting out Maggie May. When she speaks her eyes grow wide, her hands wave wildly. She has a very foul mouth. I think she's beautiful. I follow her around, seeking advice and comfort. Using my CD player, we sing and dance to Dolly Parton tunes in the visiting room, prancing over the sunbeams on the floor. I sit next to her one day in a delusional but good mood. I want to be a missionary, a missionary in Mexico. She smiles, beatifically. Barbara tells that all sorts of people can be missionaries, even crazy people. That strikes me as the wisest thing I've ever heard. It gives me hope.  ADAMS: So you're out of control, in and out of hospitals, with different doctors, on lots of medication. Then comes the time when you consider electroshock therapy. You write that a mother undergoing electroshock is better than a mother who committed suicide. And you make that decision with the agreement of your husband and you go through that process. And later on, as a reporter, you go back to watch it. Tell us what that was like.  Ms. GODINES: Well, that was an incredible experience. Honestly, I thought I'll be able to handle it. I thought, this won't be so hard, I've been through it, how difficult can it be. Maybe I had a little bit of a cavalier attitude about it. But when I went back the experience was just devastating. I found myself feeling almost panicked, staring at the patient as he was going through his convulsions and thinking to myself, my God, I was in this place at one point. And it was just, it was just an incredible experience. NOAH ADAMS, host: But you have no memory of the procedures? Ms. GODINES: I have no memory. I have memory of right up until they put me under, and I lost a lot of short-term memory around this time, and I remember coming out of the procedure very groggy and always with a smile on my face from what I understand from the nurses. But watching it was - it was very bizarre. ADAMS: 80 percent success rate. Ms. GODINES: Yes. It's really an amazing procedure, and it's never your first option. In fact, in California you have to, by law, get a second opinion and you have to have tried at least two anti-depressants, and most doctors have tried many more combinations before that. And in my case we had tried everything. I was afraid, but I was so desperate to get better. ADAMS: You continue with medications. You go to group therapy and that seems to help quite a bit. The thing that turns it around in the story, for me, was the time that David Fitzgerald(ph), your husband, admitted that he was in trouble, too, that he had under a great deal of strain. Would you read some of that, please? Ms. GODINES: (Reading) One Saturday night, David and I are sitting on the couch reading books. I put mine down and look at him. There's something I've been wanting to talk about, I say. I think we've been growing distant from each other. We're growing apart. David stares at me. I agree. I want to know why, what it is I've done. Throughout this illness he's been my caretaker, the housekeeper, mother and father to Gabriella(ph). All along he's been finishing his dissertation, usually working on it after Gabriella and I have gone to bed. His chin starts to quiver and his eyes fill with tears. He suddenly takes his glasses off and throws them. I'm afraid you're going to kill yourself. It's like being married to somebody with a terminal illness, he says. How can you want to kill yourself, he asks angrily? How can you do that to Gabriella. You can't do that to her. This is not the David I know. The David I know does not break down. That's my job. I don't know what to say. I had no idea how badly this was affecting David. I'd been so self-absorbed. I place my head on his chest and try to comfort him, but the only thing I hear are his sobs. I sit up and look him straight in the eye. You may not believe me, but I'm not going to kill myself. I've already made that decision. I won't do that to Gabriella. I hug him tightly. Suddenly I'm the comforter, I'm the responsible one - somebody I haven't been. I vow to clean the house, pick up more chores and baby responsibilities. I'll take care of the man who has been holding me up. ADAMS: To prove you could take some responsibility, you went out and went shopping and actually bought some things and brought them back and put them away. And that was a big achievement for you. Ms. GODINES: Going to the grocery store is something I've never liked to do, and I made myself go, and I felt so proud when I got back and put away the groceries, and like a little kid was excited and couldn't wait to tell David. It was such a small thing, but in the context of everything it was really something quite large for me. ADAMS: Do you recall telling your editors, your boss at the Orange County Register what was going on with you, or did it become obvious that you were in a great deal of distress?  How'd that work? Ms. GODINES: When I first went out, when I first had my psychotic episode, it was very secretive. Nobody knew what had happened. Only my immediate editor knew that I was in a mental hospital. And I wanted it that way because I was so afraid that I would be perceived as weak and unable to do my job. But I slowly began to realize that - as weird as this may sound, it was also a very fascinating experience and I had the urge to share it with people, including my top bosses. So I sat down with the top editor and I laid everything out for him. At that time I even told him, I said, I think one day I may want to write about this. And he said, well let's see how you fell once you get a little bit better. (Soundbite of music) ADAMS: Valeria Godines did get better. She's off lithium now but still takes several other medications. She's back at work full-time at the Orange County Register and has turned her attention to migration issues. Godines says she plans to share the series with her daughter Gabriella, who is now three, once she is an adult.  More to come on DAY TO DAY.  NOAH ADAMS, host:   It's DAY TO DAY from NPR News.

I'm Joe Palca. Ira Flatow is away. This week, Matthew Amorello, the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority chairman, resigned after facing increasing criticism of his management of the Big Dig, a huge tunnel project through Boston that's been called one of the biggest feats of engineering in the country. Earlier this month concrete panels weighing several tons each, fell from the ceiling of part of the tunnel, killing a woman. The panels were held up by a system of bolts and epoxy glue embedded in the roof of the tunnel. Inspectors now say that over 1,400 of the bolt hangars will need to be reinforced for safety. This hour we're going to talk about engineering structures and some of the basic building materials that make up the world around us - materials like concrete, steel and wood.  If you'd like to join the conversation, give us a call. Our number is 1-800-989-8255, that's 1-800-989-TALK. And if you want more information about what we're talking about this hour, go to our Web site at www. sciencefriday. com. Now, I'd like to introduce my guests. Steven Cramer is a professor in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering and is associate dean of academic affairs in the College of Engineering at the University of Wisconsin - Madison. He joins us from the studios of Wisconsin Public Radio. Welcome to the program. Mr. STEVEN CRAMER (Civil and Environmental Engineering; University of Wisconsin-Madison): Hello, Joe. Delighted to be here. PALCA: Great!  And we also have with us Christopher Earls. He's the editor-in-chief of the Americas - of the International journal Steel and Composite Structures and is an associate professor in the School of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Cornell University and is - I'm sorry - in New York. And he joins us from the studio on the Cornell campus. Welcome. Mr. CHRISTOPHER EARLS (Editor-in-Chief, Steel and Composite Structures): Thank you, Joe. Pleasure to be here. PALCA: Great!  So let's - I know I'm not going to - I know that neither of you gentleman have been directly associated, or I don't believe you're directly associated with the investigation into this problem they've had in Boston. But I'm just wondering in a theoretical sense if you - is there a way in advance to say uh-oh, we have a problem here. Maybe I can put that question to you Christopher Earls. Mr. EARLS: So the possibility exists that there may, in a circumstance like this, be some early warning sign in the form of a gross deformation that may present itself and be measurable. And I say gross from the standpoint that it's a large-scale deflection even though a single anchor bolt may be what the initiator of the failure was. That could be detected, for instance, using some sort of a technique such as related to surveying or something like this. PALCA: So how would that work? How would you use a surveying technique to see whether there was any kind of deformation? Mr. EARLS: So there are technologies that exist where you can map large-scale components to very high accuracies and seek or be able to measure what your current condition is - compared to some baseline condition - and then be able to gauge a change and how much change has occurred. And this can be as small as fractions of a millimeter using these types of, in this case, laser scanning. PALCA: Huh. And how, I mean, what would you do, for example, I mean, what would be the next step if you saw one of these deformations and, you know, what would you do to prevent something bad happening? Mr. EARLS: So, again, I'm not terribly familiar with this particular failure or the Big Dig itself.  PALCA: Right. Mr. EARLS: But if we were to, let's say, scan the tunnel lining or the ceiling of this particular piece that fell, and were to observe that this concrete slab that was about 3,000 pounds - quite large - had moved a millimeter or so in advance then, perhaps, one might want to discern why it was that that motion occurred or that movement occurred and go seek the cause. PALCA: I see.  Mr. CRAMER: Of course. PALCA: Go ahead. Steven Cramer, sure, go ahead. Mr. CRAMER: Yeah, of course, the challenge is knowing where to look. And the displacements or deformations that Chris described are usually so small that you wouldn't notice them unless you thought you had a problem there in the first place. PALCA: Right. So how, I mean, if you're - when you teach engineers what to look for, what are you teaching them to look for?  Steven Cramer, maybe I can put that to you. Mr. CRAMER: Sure. Well, what we have here - clearly in the case of the Big Dig something happened there that wasn't supposed to happen. And when it occurred and where it occurred, you know, at this point I don't think we know. PALCA: Mm-hmm.  Mr. CRAMER: So, you know, we train engineers to handle risk - this is basically a risk problem - to insure that the load, in this case, the weight of the panels, would be less than the material resistance, in this case, the epoxy and the bolts. And if everyone does their job correctly, then the panels don't fall down. The trick here is that during construction and the design process, of course, things can happen that aren't anticipated. And very few of us, including the public, want to pay for a structure that I would call too safe. PALCA: Mm-hmm. Mr. CRAMER: They want to pay for a structure which is safe, but not one that's too safe. PALCA: I got it. . . Mr. CRAMER: And therein lies the challenge. PALCA: Yeah, so it's navigating the reasonable amount of safety without making it so, I mean, so safe that it's got 10-foot thick walls. Actually, I heard that necessarily, people tend to associate really thick walls with safety, but in some cases that's not the case. So, anyway, I guess it's a series of engineering decisions that have to be made. Mr. CRAMER: Exactly. PALCA: Okay. Mr. CRAMER: And we train our engineers and educate our engineers to be able to look at the numbers and weigh these risks and safeties. Clearly, though, some of this is codified. There are building codes that are legal documents and engineers, at a minimum, have to meet those requirements. PALCA: Got it. Sorry, did you want to finish that thought. Mr. EARLS: So I was going to reiterate what Steve was saying. . . PALCA: Oh, Mr. Earls, go ahead, yeah. Mr. EARLS: . . . so I was going to reiterate what Steve had said about what we, you know - there's an expectation on the part of the designer, the engineer, that that which is designed and specified will be constructed in the fashion and manner in which it was intended.  And so it's possible, for instance in this case, that the hangar bolts, that they may have been, on paper, shown to have adequate capacity, but as Steve had pointed out, perhaps there were site conditions that prevented the proper installation of the bolts.  I had heard of one instance where there may have been some problems related to the tunnel lining and so there could have been water infiltrating into the areas where the epoxy should be curing and potentially, you know, that could affect its final strength and so forth. But these are important differences that do occur in the real world that would violate assumptions made by the designer, and that could lead to a condition where there may be a compromise in capacity over what was intended. PALCA: I'd like to invite one other person to join our conversation. Paul Monteiro is a professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of California in Berkeley. And he joins me today by phone from Sao Paolo, Brazil. And perhaps we'll find out what he's doing in Brazil, but thanks for joining us today. Mr. PAUL MONTEIRO (Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of California at Berkeley): Oh, my pleasure. Thanks for inviting me. PALCA: So, you've just written an article in the proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, trying to evaluate the longevity, I guess, of concrete. And I'm just wondering. I mean given what we just heard about the possibility that water would've gotten into concrete. Is that the kind of thing you have to try to anticipate when you're building a structure with material like concrete that can be deformed if water's dripping into it? Mr. MONTEIRO: Oh, precisely. The problem with concrete is that if not properly done, it can very porous. And if it is very porous, water can percolate. And that can be even worse because this water could contain some aggressive elements like chloride sulfates, which can crack the concrete and expand it. PALCA: I see. You know, and what surprises me is that concrete has been around since the Greeks and the Romans were building structures. Is there really more to learn about concrete? It seems like that would've been a really well studied piece of building material. Mr. MONTEIRO: Of course, this is the natural question that every time when it goes to a party, people will always wonder why somebody could spend a lifetime studying concrete. And the fact of the matter it is, concrete's a completely complex material that porous structures ranges from the microbe size - excuse me - continue to the nanometers. And the big problems in the construction is that sometimes people don't do a good job and the imperfection can be in the sizes of inches. So we have a scale of seven times, which is tremendous. So if you want to do some things scientific in modeling it's quite of a challenge. And if I may, basically the modern - well, modern is a strong word - but certainly the Roman concrete had two advantages. One of this is the safety factor was tremendous. You see whatever is left, you see the sizes of everything. The second part is that they did not use reinforcing steel. That is to say they could not put concrete through tremendous amount of tension, otherwise it would crack. So we have to do something very safe, very economical, and also ecologically correct. PALCA: And what would be ecologic - I mean what's the ecological component? Mr. MONTEIRO: Certainly. Just think in terms of the volumes of concrete that's being used in the world now, which is about 11. 5 billons tons per year - in the world. So if you think in terms of the population of the world, we are talking about, what, six billion people? In average, we have just about two tons per person per year. Now, the question is to produce cement, we have to generate CO2 in the atmosphere because of the burning process. So for each ton of cement, it generates one ton of CO2. So the production of cement, which is used in concrete, is responsible for about 7 percent of the CO2 emission. PALCA: So that's something I hadn't really contemplated. But by building a concrete structure, you're contributing to global warming in a sense, or at least to the buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere if you believe that to contribute to global warming. Mr. MONTEIRO: Absolutely. On the other hand, concrete is really a - if properly done, I want to emphasize that - is a very ecological process because we can use waste products for other industries. For instance, we can use a huge amount of fly ash, which is a byproduct from the process of burning coal. . . PALCA: Dr. Monteiro, I'm going to have to interrupt you there for - we have to take a quick break. But we're talking about the structures that contribute to the things that we live in, work in, build, drive through, what have you. And we'll be taking your calls and talking more about this when we come back after a short break, so stay with us. This is TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. (Soundbite of music) PALCA: From NPR News, this is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Joe Palca. We're talking this hour about engineering and materials. My guests are Steven Cramer. He's a professor in the department of civil and environmental engineering at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Christopher Earls is an associate professor in the School of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Cornell University in Ithaca, N. Y. And Paul Monteiro is a professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of California at Berkeley, although today he's in Brazil. And you're welcome to the conversation. Our number is 1-800-989-8255. That's 1-800-989-TALK. And let's take a call right now. How about Guntrum(ph) - I think I've got that right - in Newton, Mass. Welcome to the program. GUNTRUM (Caller): Well, thank you. Yes. I have two questions actually. The first question is why do they put these both in vertically. That seems the worse possible way of doing it when you could put it at an angle or even use a pair of bolts at the two opposite angles. That's my first question. The second question is: they keep talking about supporting the weight of the slab. It seems to me there's forces much larger to consider. I mean, ten slabs fell down, not one. So when the first one fell down, I assumed what happened is that it sort of wedged itself against the next one causing it to fall down also and down the line. PALCA: Well, Guntrum, I have to point out that none of my guests are explicitly working on this particular problem, but perhaps one you gentlemen can at least make some comment on that. Yes, go ahead.  Mr. EARLS: This is Chris. PALCA: Chris, go ahead. Mr. EARLS: I could probably point something out that is indicative of the anchor bolts, itself is typically you want it to be loaded it in withdrawal(ph), which is a uniaxial(ph) state of stress. You have pure tension. And so if you were to put a bolt at an angle, the bolt then would be experiencing some bending and beam action, and that actually makes the anchor bolt weaker. And so you try to avoid that in a situation such as this. You would like the bolt to be as strong as it can be and that would be in a tension-only condition. And so I think that's why it's not angled in. PALCA: And this other question, Guntrum says about panels falling down serially. Does one thing lead to another, as they say? Mr. EARLS: That I'm not familiar with the configuration of the system in general. And so it would be - I could only guess what would cause multiple panels to fall. But sometimes that's not uncommon where you would have a - it's still a small scale failure. One, two, three, four panels come down, hundreds of others remain in place. So it still would, in my mind, qualify as a small-scale failure even though it involved more than one panel, perhaps emanating from single bolt. PALCA: You know, what I'm wondering about in this particular circumstance is people have been building tunnels for hundreds of years certainly, building bridges for that long and much longer, thousands of years. How is it possible, given those thousands of years of experience, to build something today that doesn't even last a decade? I mean is that a fair question for someone to ask? Maybe I can put that to you Steven or Christopher. Go ahead. Mr. CRAMER: Sure. This is Steve. PALCA: Alright. Steve, go ahead. Mr. CRAMER: Yeah, that's a fair question. I think you have to remember is that our materials and our techniques are changing over time. And as Paul pointed out we're using different additives in concrete than we've used in the past. And with wooden materials that I work with, we're combining the wood, raw material, in different ways in the structural numbers. So our techniques and our materials are changing and they're changing fairly dramatically. And surprisingly, yes, there is a lot to learn yet about these materials. I think sometimes in our excitement over biotechnology and some of the other so-called hot areas of research, we sometimes to forget that these everyday things we don't understand completely yet either. PALCA: So, maybe I could ask you this. Then there are new materials, if they're being introduced they obviously have some advantages. Maybe you can talk about the advantages of new materials and the disadvantages. For example, drywall verses plaster. Mr. CRAMER: Sure. Not too long ago I was doing a study on drywall, much to the amusement of my children at the dinner table. Wondering why anyone would study something so unexciting. But it turns out that drywall is ubiquitous in structures. It's used as the primary fire protection mechanism in light frame structures, including houses and apartment buildings, and smaller buildings. And we don't know very much about how it actually behaves from an engineering point of view. And we know it works. We know it slows the progression of fire. It's clearly saved lives in many instances. But yet it's never been really researched and fully understood and designed from an engineering point of view. And that's just an example of several holes we have in structures and materials that we need to fill. PALCA: Let's take another call now and go to David in Portsmouth, Virginia. David, welcome to Science Friday. DAVID (Caller): Hey, good morning, or good afternoon. Listen, I'm an engineer. I've worked with bolts for about the last 35 years exclusively. And I had a couple of questions. Number one, exactly what did fail? Was it the epoxy, was it the concrete, or was it the bolt itself? PALCA: Well, David, I want to reinforce - reinforce - I want to remind everybody that none of my guests on this show are explicitly involved in this investigation, so I'm not sure that they can answer that question. But just in general, what are the - maybe we can make it a more general question - what are the possible failure points when a hanger bolt fails. Maybe, I don't know, Christopher Earls, is that something. . . Mr. EARLS: Sure. . . DAVID: Well, there are some that are obvious. The epoxy - when mixing epoxy, the manufacturer has certain rules and regulations. It's been my experience that the engineers say, here's what we want and here what happens. And it finally goes down to a mill (unintelligible) - it's some place n the (unintelligible) field - and they mix it up sort of the way they think they're going to mix it up. Quality control of mixing that epoxy must've, just has to have been very, very exquisite. It has to be right exactly on the mark. And I also wondered, what physical traits would keep that bolt from falling out? Was there a head in there? Was there a crosspiece? Was there a cross. . . Was there any. . . What would've kept that bolt up in there? PALCA: Okay. Let me see if we have any responses to that. I'm sorry, Christopher Earls, can you address that at all? Mr. EARLS: Well, so Dave makes an excellent observation from the standpoint that clearly for the epoxy to be properly functioning and to carry its design intents it has to be mixed properly and cured properly. And again, there's, you know, it just in what's available in media coverage up to this point, there's some indication that perhaps maybe the inside conditions created a circumstance where the curing may not have been able to cure properly I suppose. But in general, failure modes in bolts, again, if they're loaded in tension as they're supposed to be, you can have an excessive elongation. Like a piece of gum being stretched way too far and that's that one failure mode. And that gives you a great deal of warning because you can see the bolt elongating and detect the stress in the structural system prior to a catastrophic failure. And the other cause would be one that's unfortunate, and that would be a brittle, sudden failure fracture on a nut section. And in that instance, there would little or no warning and the bolt would fracture and fail. But, again, it's not, I don't know whether there was a failure in the epoxy or a failure of the bolt itself. I hear in the media that it's the epoxy, but I don't know. PALCA: Well, there was some mention also in the media today that perhaps some construction nearby or the building that was going on causing a vibration. Maybe I could turn back to Paul Monteiro and ask, if you build a building out of concrete with a certain set of expectations - or for example, a dam with a certain set of expectations - and suddenly there's something that changes at the site. Can you make any predictions about how the material's going to behave? Mr. MONTEIRO: Correct. This always a tough question to address. (unintelligible) all the design of all this important structures, the engineers spend a tremendous amount of scenarios of what could go wrong, because sometimes it will go wrong. So in case of dams, that you ask, we try to take care of all the possibilities. And even so, there is always something that goes wrong - well not always - but certainly it could be very small that you could fix without any problem. But it's very rare that a large project would go without any problem. That doesn't mean to say that expect anybody to have tremendous consequence in the structure. But the point I'd like to address is the extreme needs of development of non-destructive techniques. And we are developing completely new extenders and (unintelligible) in the last 10 years or say there's a new revolution on the way non-destructive techniques are being developed. Of course there is a big transition from the laboratory to the field practice. And it's going a little bit slower but it's quite expectable that in a short period of time we have new equipment that can address many of these concerns. PALCA: So what do you mean a non-destructive technique? I mean how does that work? Mr. MONTEIRO: Right. The standard way of doing things in concrete, because it's so massive, once you cast the structure you have no clue, unless you see cracks that things really are going wrong. And unlike, say, a piece of small metallic components - say in a car or an airplane that you can send an acoustic emission process or sound waves. Concrete is very massive so it generates these waves. So you want to put a lot of sensors inside and outside the concrete structure and it use a system approach and try to identify what's wrong and what's right and that creates a loops. Things that are going well, according to plan, we got confidence. When things do not follow exactly what we predict, we go there and check and inspect. And we do that without doing any damage to the structure. PALCA: Now I got it. Okay. Well, you know, what's always - I mean this is something that I've always wondered about. Maybe this is my chance to find out. Christopher Earls, there are signs before you cross over a bridge frequently that say, this bridge is rated to carry a load of 16,000 pounds. Now I saw a cartoon once. It was a Calvin and Hobbes where Calvin, who's the little kid, is asking his dad how they decide what the weight-bearing load is. And he says, well, they keep driving trucks across it until it collapses and they rebuild it to the, and then they know how much - I don't think that's the right answer. But it makes me wonder if - I mean you're obviously, at some level, you're making an inference about, okay, this material is so strong and this structure is so strong. But you have to assume that the ground isn't shifting or the materials are the way they are. How do they make those kinds of judgments? Mr. EARLS: Well, in the case of modern design specifications - and not all bridges are designed using most modern techniques - but as we move forward with design specifications, there's a probabilistic framework that's overlaid on top of the deterministic engineering theories that we use how much strength will this beam have and so forth and so on. But you're absolutely right. There's a variability in terms of the loading. I can never know with any certainty what types of loads will be on the bridge deck at any given time. In addition, I won't know if those loads are occurring in conjunction with a snowstorm, or if they're occurring in conjunction with high winds. In addition, I won't know with any absolute certainty that the steel that I specified for the bridge and my design calculations actually made it into the bridge in exactly the same way that I wanted. Or, that the alignment of the bridge is precisely the same way that I anticipated. And so these are little variabilities, perturbations to the system that have to be accounted for. And modern design specifications adopt a probabilistic framework so that we could try to come up with what's known as a reliability index, an ability to quantify it with some degree of confidence what the probability of a failure will be at an arbitrary point in time. PALCA: We're talking about structures, materials that are used to make buildings that we live in. And we're talking about ways of assessing how safe they are and how likely they are to collapse, which I'm happy to say most of the time is very unlikely. I'm Joe Palca and this is TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. Although I also have to add, you know, in terms of this probabilistic model, that my wife is a bit of a fatalist when it comes to these structures and she's certain that every parking structure that she drives into is going to collapse while she's parking her car. I'm glad you're laughing, because I laugh and she thinks I'm just making fun of her, but I'm not. Mr. EARLS: How many people do you know that have died in a structural collapse? PALCA: It's irrelevant. I've tried that argument. Mr. EARLS: I know, but that's one possible way to. . . PALCA: Go ahead, Steven Cramer (unintelligible) Mr. CRAMER: Well, I think there's a new sensitivity. Ever since 9/11 and then following up with Katrina and Rita last year, I think there's a new sensitivity on the part of the public that buildings are not invulnerable and that they can collapse. And I'm not sure people were thinking about that every day prior to 9/11. I think there's a new sensitivity in the public in that regard. PALCA: And what is reasonable for the public to expect given a new building? I mean, obviously, it would be very difficult to design a building anticipating that an airplane would be flown into it. But what's reasonable? Mr. CRAMER: Exactly. 9/11 was clearly a very extreme event for which the building was not designed and it still survived for some time after that impact. But we do have load data, both due to human movement, structure movements, car movements in the case of your parking ramp, we have weather data for snow loads and wind loads. And we can regionalize that data as well. So, for example, in Paul's area in California, we have earthquakes that we have to consider, and yet in Madison, Wisconsin, that's a relatively minor risk. So we have those historical records by which we can characterize loads. And similarly we have reasonable information about materials and how much they can resist. And that's where the safety index comes in and ratio-ing those two to ensure that the chances of that parking garage collapsing as your wife drives into it is extremely small. PALCA: I think we have time for one more quick question. So let's try to get that in. Bruce in Berkeley, Massachusetts. Bruce, welcome to the program. BRUCE (Caller): Hi. PALCA: Hi. BRUCE: I find it hard to believe that you could have sound engineering practices that puts 10-ton pieces of concrete on top of people driving unless the concrete is absolutely necessary for the bridge. It didn't seem like it was a structural element. How could it be sound practice to put those things, no matter how they are supported, on top of people if they don't have to be there. Can someone explain that to me? PALCA: Okay. Well, we'll take a crack at that but we're going to have to keep it short. Paul Monteiro, maybe you can give a brief answer to that complex question, I'm sure. Mr. MONTEIRO: I'll be very brief. I'm not familiar with the design at all. The accident happened while I was abroad so I'm getting very small piece of information. So if anybody has any insight. . . PALCA: Okay. We'll throw it open to others. Do any of your gentlemen have a. . . Mr. CRAMER: Well, sometimes in a critical application, you try to build on redundancy. And by that I mean that you don't rely on any single bolt or any single component to keep the structure safe. That's a strategy that sometimes engineers employ in a life critical situation. I do not know what kind of redundancies existed or why the panels were needed in the Big Dig. PALCA: Okay. Well, I'm afraid that's going to have to be where we leave it. I'd like to thank my guest, Steven Cramer, who's a professor in the department of civil and environmental engineering at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. Christopher Earls is the editor-in-chief for the Americas of the International Journal Steel and Composite Structures, and an associate professor in the School of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Cornel University in Ithaca. And Paul Monteiro is a professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of California at Berkeley. Thanks to all of you. Mr. CRAMER: Thank you very much, Joe. PALCA: Okay. And when we come back, some places you might consider going for your summer vacation, although you'll need a lot more than frequent flyer miles to get there. Stay with us. This is TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.  JOE PALCA, host:  This is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. I'm Joe Palca. Ira Flatow is away.  This week, Matthew Amorello, the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority chairman, resigned after facing increasing criticism of his management of the Big Dig, a huge tunnel project through Boston that's been called one of the biggest feats of engineering in the country.  Earlier this month concrete panels weighing several tons each, fell from the ceiling of part of the tunnel, killing a woman. The panels were held up by a system of bolts and epoxy glue embedded in the roof of the tunnel. Inspectors now say that over 1,400 of the bolt hangars will need to be reinforced for safety.  This hour we're going to talk about engineering structures and some of the basic building materials that make up the world around us - materials like concrete, steel and wood.   If you'd like to join the conversation, give us a call. Our number is 1-800-989-8255, that's 1-800-989-TALK. And if you want more information about what we're talking about this hour, go to our Web site at www. sciencefriday. com.  Now, I'd like to introduce my guests. Steven Cramer is a professor in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering and is associate dean of academic affairs in the College of Engineering at the University of Wisconsin - Madison. He joins us from the studios of Wisconsin Public Radio. Welcome to the program.  Mr. STEVEN CRAMER (Civil and Environmental Engineering; University of Wisconsin-Madison): Hello, Joe. Delighted to be here.  PALCA: Great!   And we also have with us Christopher Earls. He's the editor-in-chief of the Americas - of the International journal Steel and Composite Structures and is an associate professor in the School of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Cornell University and is - I'm sorry - in New York. And he joins us from the studio on the Cornell campus. Welcome.  Mr. CHRISTOPHER EARLS (Editor-in-Chief, Steel and Composite Structures): Thank you, Joe. Pleasure to be here.  PALCA: Great!  So let's - I know I'm not going to - I know that neither of you gentleman have been directly associated, or I don't believe you're directly associated with the investigation into this problem they've had in Boston. But I'm just wondering in a theoretical sense if you - is there a way in advance to say uh-oh, we have a problem here. Maybe I can put that question to you Christopher Earls.  Mr. EARLS: So the possibility exists that there may, in a circumstance like this, be some early warning sign in the form of a gross deformation that may present itself and be measurable. And I say gross from the standpoint that it's a large-scale deflection even though a single anchor bolt may be what the initiator of the failure was. That could be detected, for instance, using some sort of a technique such as related to surveying or something like this.  PALCA: So how would that work? How would you use a surveying technique to see whether there was any kind of deformation?  Mr. EARLS: So there are technologies that exist where you can map large-scale components to very high accuracies and seek or be able to measure what your current condition is - compared to some baseline condition - and then be able to gauge a change and how much change has occurred. And this can be as small as fractions of a millimeter using these types of, in this case, laser scanning.  PALCA: Huh. And how, I mean, what would you do, for example, I mean, what would be the next step if you saw one of these deformations and, you know, what would you do to prevent something bad happening?  Mr. EARLS: So, again, I'm not terribly familiar with this particular failure or the Big Dig itself.   PALCA: Right.  Mr. EARLS: But if we were to, let's say, scan the tunnel lining or the ceiling of this particular piece that fell, and were to observe that this concrete slab that was about 3,000 pounds - quite large - had moved a millimeter or so in advance then, perhaps, one might want to discern why it was that that motion occurred or that movement occurred and go seek the cause.  PALCA: I see.   Mr. CRAMER: Of course.  PALCA: Go ahead. Steven Cramer, sure, go ahead.  Mr. CRAMER: Yeah, of course, the challenge is knowing where to look. And the displacements or deformations that Chris described are usually so small that you wouldn't notice them unless you thought you had a problem there in the first place.  PALCA: Right. So how, I mean, if you're - when you teach engineers what to look for, what are you teaching them to look for?  Steven Cramer, maybe I can put that to you.  Mr. CRAMER: Sure. Well, what we have here - clearly in the case of the Big Dig something happened there that wasn't supposed to happen. And when it occurred and where it occurred, you know, at this point I don't think we know.  PALCA: Mm-hmm.   Mr. CRAMER: So, you know, we train engineers to handle risk - this is basically a risk problem - to insure that the load, in this case, the weight of the panels, would be less than the material resistance, in this case, the epoxy and the bolts. And if everyone does their job correctly, then the panels don't fall down.  The trick here is that during construction and the design process, of course, things can happen that aren't anticipated. And very few of us, including the public, want to pay for a structure that I would call too safe.  PALCA: Mm-hmm.  Mr. CRAMER: They want to pay for a structure which is safe, but not one that's too safe.  PALCA: I got it. . .  Mr. CRAMER: And therein lies the challenge.  PALCA: Yeah, so it's navigating the reasonable amount of safety without making it so, I mean, so safe that it's got 10-foot thick walls. Actually, I heard that necessarily, people tend to associate really thick walls with safety, but in some cases that's not the case. So, anyway, I guess it's a series of engineering decisions that have to be made.  Mr. CRAMER: Exactly.  PALCA: Okay.  Mr. CRAMER: And we train our engineers and educate our engineers to be able to look at the numbers and weigh these risks and safeties. Clearly, though, some of this is codified. There are building codes that are legal documents and engineers, at a minimum, have to meet those requirements.  PALCA: Got it. Sorry, did you want to finish that thought.  Mr. EARLS: So I was going to reiterate what Steve was saying. . .  PALCA: Oh, Mr. Earls, go ahead, yeah.  Mr. EARLS: . . . so I was going to reiterate what Steve had said about what we, you know - there's an expectation on the part of the designer, the engineer, that that which is designed and specified will be constructed in the fashion and manner in which it was intended.   And so it's possible, for instance in this case, that the hangar bolts, that they may have been, on paper, shown to have adequate capacity, but as Steve had pointed out, perhaps there were site conditions that prevented the proper installation of the bolts.   I had heard of one instance where there may have been some problems related to the tunnel lining and so there could have been water infiltrating into the areas where the epoxy should be curing and potentially, you know, that could affect its final strength and so forth. But these are important differences that do occur in the real world that would violate assumptions made by the designer, and that could lead to a condition where there may be a compromise in capacity over what was intended.  PALCA: I'd like to invite one other person to join our conversation. Paul Monteiro is a professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of California in Berkeley. And he joins me today by phone from Sao Paolo, Brazil. And perhaps we'll find out what he's doing in Brazil, but thanks for joining us today.  Mr. PAUL MONTEIRO (Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of California at Berkeley): Oh, my pleasure. Thanks for inviting me.  PALCA: So, you've just written an article in the proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, trying to evaluate the longevity, I guess, of concrete. And I'm just wondering. I mean given what we just heard about the possibility that water would've gotten into concrete. Is that the kind of thing you have to try to anticipate when you're building a structure with material like concrete that can be deformed if water's dripping into it?  Mr. MONTEIRO: Oh, precisely. The problem with concrete is that if not properly done, it can very porous. And if it is very porous, water can percolate. And that can be even worse because this water could contain some aggressive elements like chloride sulfates, which can crack the concrete and expand it.  PALCA: I see. You know, and what surprises me is that concrete has been around since the Greeks and the Romans were building structures. Is there really more to learn about concrete? It seems like that would've been a really well studied piece of building material.  Mr. MONTEIRO: Of course, this is the natural question that every time when it goes to a party, people will always wonder why somebody could spend a lifetime studying concrete. And the fact of the matter it is, concrete's a completely complex material that porous structures ranges from the microbe size - excuse me - continue to the nanometers. And the big problems in the construction is that sometimes people don't do a good job and the imperfection can be in the sizes of inches.  So we have a scale of seven times, which is tremendous. So if you want to do some things scientific in modeling it's quite of a challenge. And if I may, basically the modern - well, modern is a strong word - but certainly the Roman concrete had two advantages. One of this is the safety factor was tremendous. You see whatever is left, you see the sizes of everything.  The second part is that they did not use reinforcing steel. That is to say they could not put concrete through tremendous amount of tension, otherwise it would crack. So we have to do something very safe, very economical, and also ecologically correct.  PALCA: And what would be ecologic - I mean what's the ecological component?  Mr. MONTEIRO: Certainly. Just think in terms of the volumes of concrete that's being used in the world now, which is about 11. 5 billons tons per year - in the world. So if you think in terms of the population of the world, we are talking about, what, six billion people? In average, we have just about two tons per person per year.  Now, the question is to produce cement, we have to generate CO2 in the atmosphere because of the burning process. So for each ton of cement, it generates one ton of CO2. So the production of cement, which is used in concrete, is responsible for about 7 percent of the CO2 emission.  PALCA: So that's something I hadn't really contemplated. But by building a concrete structure, you're contributing to global warming in a sense, or at least to the buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere if you believe that to contribute to global warming.  Mr. MONTEIRO: Absolutely. On the other hand, concrete is really a - if properly done, I want to emphasize that - is a very ecological process because we can use waste products for other industries. For instance, we can use a huge amount of fly ash, which is a byproduct from the process of burning coal. . .  PALCA: Dr. Monteiro, I'm going to have to interrupt you there for - we have to take a quick break. But we're talking about the structures that contribute to the things that we live in, work in, build, drive through, what have you. And we'll be taking your calls and talking more about this when we come back after a short break, so stay with us.  This is TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.  (Soundbite of music)  PALCA: From NPR News, this is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Joe Palca. We're talking this hour about engineering and materials.  My guests are Steven Cramer. He's a professor in the department of civil and environmental engineering at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Christopher Earls is an associate professor in the School of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Cornell University in Ithaca, N. Y. And Paul Monteiro is a professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of California at Berkeley, although today he's in Brazil.  And you're welcome to the conversation. Our number is 1-800-989-8255. That's 1-800-989-TALK. And let's take a call right now. How about Guntrum(ph) - I think I've got that right - in Newton, Mass. Welcome to the program.  GUNTRUM (Caller): Well, thank you. Yes. I have two questions actually. The first question is why do they put these both in vertically. That seems the worse possible way of doing it when you could put it at an angle or even use a pair of bolts at the two opposite angles. That's my first question. The second question is: they keep talking about supporting the weight of the slab. It seems to me there's forces much larger to consider. I mean, ten slabs fell down, not one. So when the first one fell down, I assumed what happened is that it sort of wedged itself against the next one causing it to fall down also and down the line.  PALCA: Well, Guntrum, I have to point out that none of my guests are explicitly working on this particular problem, but perhaps one you gentlemen can at least make some comment on that. Yes, go ahead.   Mr. EARLS: This is Chris.  PALCA: Chris, go ahead.  Mr. EARLS: I could probably point something out that is indicative of the anchor bolts, itself is typically you want it to be loaded it in withdrawal(ph), which is a uniaxial(ph) state of stress. You have pure tension. And so if you were to put a bolt at an angle, the bolt then would be experiencing some bending and beam action, and that actually makes the anchor bolt weaker.  And so you try to avoid that in a situation such as this. You would like the bolt to be as strong as it can be and that would be in a tension-only condition. And so I think that's why it's not angled in.  PALCA: And this other question, Guntrum says about panels falling down serially. Does one thing lead to another, as they say?  Mr. EARLS: That I'm not familiar with the configuration of the system in general. And so it would be - I could only guess what would cause multiple panels to fall. But sometimes that's not uncommon where you would have a - it's still a small scale failure. One, two, three, four panels come down, hundreds of others remain in place. So it still would, in my mind, qualify as a small-scale failure even though it involved more than one panel, perhaps emanating from single bolt.  PALCA: You know, what I'm wondering about in this particular circumstance is people have been building tunnels for hundreds of years certainly, building bridges for that long and much longer, thousands of years. How is it possible, given those thousands of years of experience, to build something today that doesn't even last a decade? I mean is that a fair question for someone to ask? Maybe I can put that to you Steven or Christopher. Go ahead.  Mr. CRAMER: Sure. This is Steve.  PALCA: Alright. Steve, go ahead.  Mr. CRAMER: Yeah, that's a fair question. I think you have to remember is that our materials and our techniques are changing over time. And as Paul pointed out we're using different additives in concrete than we've used in the past. And with wooden materials that I work with, we're combining the wood, raw material, in different ways in the structural numbers.  So our techniques and our materials are changing and they're changing fairly dramatically. And surprisingly, yes, there is a lot to learn yet about these materials. I think sometimes in our excitement over biotechnology and some of the other so-called hot areas of research, we sometimes to forget that these everyday things we don't understand completely yet either.  PALCA: So, maybe I could ask you this. Then there are new materials, if they're being introduced they obviously have some advantages. Maybe you can talk about the advantages of new materials and the disadvantages. For example, drywall verses plaster.  Mr. CRAMER: Sure. Not too long ago I was doing a study on drywall, much to the amusement of my children at the dinner table. Wondering why anyone would study something so unexciting. But it turns out that drywall is ubiquitous in structures. It's used as the primary fire protection mechanism in light frame structures, including houses and apartment buildings, and smaller buildings.  And we don't know very much about how it actually behaves from an engineering point of view. And we know it works. We know it slows the progression of fire. It's clearly saved lives in many instances. But yet it's never been really researched and fully understood and designed from an engineering point of view.  And that's just an example of several holes we have in structures and materials that we need to fill.  PALCA: Let's take another call now and go to David in Portsmouth, Virginia. David, welcome to Science Friday.  DAVID (Caller): Hey, good morning, or good afternoon. Listen, I'm an engineer. I've worked with bolts for about the last 35 years exclusively. And I had a couple of questions. Number one, exactly what did fail? Was it the epoxy, was it the concrete, or was it the bolt itself?  PALCA: Well, David, I want to reinforce - reinforce - I want to remind everybody that none of my guests on this show are explicitly involved in this investigation, so I'm not sure that they can answer that question. But just in general, what are the - maybe we can make it a more general question - what are the possible failure points when a hanger bolt fails. Maybe, I don't know, Christopher Earls, is that something. . .  Mr. EARLS: Sure. . .  DAVID: Well, there are some that are obvious. The epoxy - when mixing epoxy, the manufacturer has certain rules and regulations. It's been my experience that the engineers say, here's what we want and here what happens. And it finally goes down to a mill (unintelligible) - it's some place n the (unintelligible) field - and they mix it up sort of the way they think they're going to mix it up. Quality control of mixing that epoxy must've, just has to have been very, very exquisite. It has to be right exactly on the mark.  And I also wondered, what physical traits would keep that bolt from falling out? Was there a head in there? Was there a crosspiece? Was there a cross. . . Was there any. . . What would've kept that bolt up in there?  PALCA: Okay. Let me see if we have any responses to that. I'm sorry, Christopher Earls, can you address that at all?  Mr. EARLS: Well, so Dave makes an excellent observation from the standpoint that clearly for the epoxy to be properly functioning and to carry its design intents it has to be mixed properly and cured properly.  And again, there's, you know, it just in what's available in media coverage up to this point, there's some indication that perhaps maybe the inside conditions created a circumstance where the curing may not have been able to cure properly I suppose.  But in general, failure modes in bolts, again, if they're loaded in tension as they're supposed to be, you can have an excessive elongation. Like a piece of gum being stretched way too far and that's that one failure mode. And that gives you a great deal of warning because you can see the bolt elongating and detect the stress in the structural system prior to a catastrophic failure.  And the other cause would be one that's unfortunate, and that would be a brittle, sudden failure fracture on a nut section. And in that instance, there would little or no warning and the bolt would fracture and fail. But, again, it's not, I don't know whether there was a failure in the epoxy or a failure of the bolt itself.  I hear in the media that it's the epoxy, but I don't know.  PALCA: Well, there was some mention also in the media today that perhaps some construction nearby or the building that was going on causing a vibration. Maybe I could turn back to Paul Monteiro and ask, if you build a building out of concrete with a certain set of expectations - or for example, a dam with a certain set of expectations - and suddenly there's something that changes at the site. Can you make any predictions about how the material's going to behave?  Mr. MONTEIRO: Correct. This always a tough question to address. (unintelligible) all the design of all this important structures, the engineers spend a tremendous amount of scenarios of what could go wrong, because sometimes it will go wrong.  So in case of dams, that you ask, we try to take care of all the possibilities. And even so, there is always something that goes wrong - well not always - but certainly it could be very small that you could fix without any problem. But it's very rare that a large project would go without any problem. That doesn't mean to say that expect anybody to have tremendous consequence in the structure.  But the point I'd like to address is the extreme needs of development of non-destructive techniques. And we are developing completely new extenders and (unintelligible) in the last 10 years or say there's a new revolution on the way non-destructive techniques are being developed.  Of course there is a big transition from the laboratory to the field practice. And it's going a little bit slower but it's quite expectable that in a short period of time we have new equipment that can address many of these concerns.  PALCA: So what do you mean a non-destructive technique? I mean how does that work?  Mr. MONTEIRO: Right. The standard way of doing things in concrete, because it's so massive, once you cast the structure you have no clue, unless you see cracks that things really are going wrong. And unlike, say, a piece of small metallic components - say in a car or an airplane that you can send an acoustic emission process or sound waves.  Concrete is very massive so it generates these waves. So you want to put a lot of sensors inside and outside the concrete structure and it use a system approach and try to identify what's wrong and what's right and that creates a loops. Things that are going well, according to plan, we got confidence. When things do not follow exactly what we predict, we go there and check and inspect. And we do that without doing any damage to the structure.  PALCA: Now I got it. Okay. Well, you know, what's always - I mean this is something that I've always wondered about. Maybe this is my chance to find out. Christopher Earls, there are signs before you cross over a bridge frequently that say, this bridge is rated to carry a load of 16,000 pounds.  Now I saw a cartoon once. It was a Calvin and Hobbes where Calvin, who's the little kid, is asking his dad how they decide what the weight-bearing load is. And he says, well, they keep driving trucks across it until it collapses and they rebuild it to the, and then they know how much - I don't think that's the right answer.  But it makes me wonder if - I mean you're obviously, at some level, you're making an inference about, okay, this material is so strong and this structure is so strong. But you have to assume that the ground isn't shifting or the materials are the way they are. How do they make those kinds of judgments?  Mr. EARLS: Well, in the case of modern design specifications - and not all bridges are designed using most modern techniques - but as we move forward with design specifications, there's a probabilistic framework that's overlaid on top of the deterministic engineering theories that we use how much strength will this beam have and so forth and so on.  But you're absolutely right. There's a variability in terms of the loading. I can never know with any certainty what types of loads will be on the bridge deck at any given time. In addition, I won't know if those loads are occurring in conjunction with a snowstorm, or if they're occurring in conjunction with high winds.  In addition, I won't know with any absolute certainty that the steel that I specified for the bridge and my design calculations actually made it into the bridge in exactly the same way that I wanted. Or, that the alignment of the bridge is precisely the same way that I anticipated.  And so these are little variabilities, perturbations to the system that have to be accounted for. And modern design specifications adopt a probabilistic framework so that we could try to come up with what's known as a reliability index, an ability to quantify it with some degree of confidence what the probability of a failure will be at an arbitrary point in time.  PALCA: We're talking about structures, materials that are used to make buildings that we live in. And we're talking about ways of assessing how safe they are and how likely they are to collapse, which I'm happy to say most of the time is very unlikely.  I'm Joe Palca and this is TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.  Although I also have to add, you know, in terms of this probabilistic model, that my wife is a bit of a fatalist when it comes to these structures and she's certain that every parking structure that she drives into is going to collapse while she's parking her car.  I'm glad you're laughing, because I laugh and she thinks I'm just making fun of her, but I'm not.  Mr. EARLS: How many people do you know that have died in a structural collapse?  PALCA: It's irrelevant. I've tried that argument.  Mr. EARLS: I know, but that's one possible way to. . .  PALCA: Go ahead, Steven Cramer (unintelligible)  Mr. CRAMER: Well, I think there's a new sensitivity. Ever since 9/11 and then following up with Katrina and Rita last year, I think there's a new sensitivity on the part of the public that buildings are not invulnerable and that they can collapse. And I'm not sure people were thinking about that every day prior to 9/11. I think there's a new sensitivity in the public in that regard.  PALCA: And what is reasonable for the public to expect given a new building? I mean, obviously, it would be very difficult to design a building anticipating that an airplane would be flown into it. But what's reasonable?  Mr. CRAMER: Exactly. 9/11 was clearly a very extreme event for which the building was not designed and it still survived for some time after that impact. But we do have load data, both due to human movement, structure movements, car movements in the case of your parking ramp, we have weather data for snow loads and wind loads. And we can regionalize that data as well.  So, for example, in Paul's area in California, we have earthquakes that we have to consider, and yet in Madison, Wisconsin, that's a relatively minor risk. So we have those historical records by which we can characterize loads. And similarly we have reasonable information about materials and how much they can resist.  And that's where the safety index comes in and ratio-ing those two to ensure that the chances of that parking garage collapsing as your wife drives into it is extremely small.  PALCA: I think we have time for one more quick question. So let's try to get that in. Bruce in Berkeley, Massachusetts. Bruce, welcome to the program.  BRUCE (Caller): Hi.  PALCA: Hi.  BRUCE: I find it hard to believe that you could have sound engineering practices that puts 10-ton pieces of concrete on top of people driving unless the concrete is absolutely necessary for the bridge. It didn't seem like it was a structural element. How could it be sound practice to put those things, no matter how they are supported, on top of people if they don't have to be there. Can someone explain that to me?  PALCA: Okay. Well, we'll take a crack at that but we're going to have to keep it short. Paul Monteiro, maybe you can give a brief answer to that complex question, I'm sure.  Mr. MONTEIRO: I'll be very brief. I'm not familiar with the design at all. The accident happened while I was abroad so I'm getting very small piece of information. So if anybody has any insight. . .  PALCA: Okay. We'll throw it open to others. Do any of your gentlemen have a. . .  Mr. CRAMER: Well, sometimes in a critical application, you try to build on redundancy. And by that I mean that you don't rely on any single bolt or any single component to keep the structure safe. That's a strategy that sometimes engineers employ in a life critical situation.  I do not know what kind of redundancies existed or why the panels were needed in the Big Dig.  PALCA: Okay. Well, I'm afraid that's going to have to be where we leave it. I'd like to thank my guest, Steven Cramer, who's a professor in the department of civil and environmental engineering at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. Christopher Earls is the editor-in-chief for the Americas of the International Journal Steel and Composite Structures, and an associate professor in the School of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Cornel University in Ithaca. And Paul Monteiro is a professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of California at Berkeley.  Thanks to all of you.  Mr. CRAMER: Thank you very much, Joe.  PALCA: Okay. And when we come back, some places you might consider going for your summer vacation, although you'll need a lot more than frequent flyer miles to get there. Stay with us.

(Soundbite of crow cawing)      TOM BANSE reporting:      Deep in the woods southwest of Seattle lies a thriving mail-order      business. Fungi Perfecti produces gourmet mushrooms and medicinal      mushroom extracts in a complex of growth houses and laboratories.      (Soundbite of humming machinery)      Mr. PAUL STAMETS (Fungi Perfecti):  Ah, shiitake!      This a gourmet Japanese black mushroom.      BANSE:  Paul Stamets is a bearded, bespectacled entrepreneur.  He picks      his way through damp and dimly lit shelves.      Mr. STAMETS:  Watch your step.  It's wet in here.  It's a very      high-humidity environment.      BANSE:  Stamets learned over the years that mushrooms have potent      medicinal qualities.  His curiosity was spurred to a new level by the      anthrax attacks on the East Coast late in 2001.      Mr. STAMETS:  So it came to me to be very clear that if you wanted to      fight anthrax, tapping into some of the antibiotical systems that these      mushrooms produce would be a logical first step.      BANSE:  Stamets knows humans and mushrooms have something in common:      They both get attacked by some of the same nasty microbes.  He reasoned      that it'd be worthwhile to look at mushrooms that put up the strongest      defense.  That led him to a rare type that grows on 500-year-old trees in      the Pacific Northwest.      Mr. STAMETS:  And because they're in the old-growth forest, in--under      such wet conditions, I'm real curious in how can something stay in the      woods for so long and not rot?  So I thought, well, that's a good group      to look at.      BANSE:  The wood conch group, also known as agaricon, is not your typical      mushroom.      Mr. STAMETS:  I have some over here.      BANSE:  You can look over there.      Mr. STAMETS:  Yeah.      BANSE:  Now let's get up and. . .      Stamets lifts a dried wood conch off a shelf.      Mr. STAMETS:  It looks like a beehive.  That's what I try to tell people,      is that if you look up in the woods and you see this thing that looks      like a beehive but it's not, hanging from a tree, that's what I'm      interested in.      BANSE:  Paul Stamets cultured numerous strains in his lab and prepared      natural extracts.      (Soundbite of machinery)      BANSE:  He then submitted samples to the Defense Department's BioShield      program for testing.  They went to a top-security US Army lab at Ft.      Detrick, Maryland.  Their scientists are screening tens of thousands of      natural and manmade compounds.  Drug discovery supervisor John Secrist      says the mushroom extract scored one of the rare hits.      Mr. JOHN SECRIST (Drug Discovery Supervisor):  There is consistent      activity in this one type of mushroom against viruses related to      smallpox.  They're not smallpox virus itself, but they're related to it.      So that in itself is very interesting.      BANSE:  Interesting, and as Paul Stamets realized, important, because the      US government lists smallpox among the biological agents it most fears      terrorists might use.      Mr. STAMETS:  In the queue are well-known viruses that we all know about,      but pox viruses rank at the very, very top.      BANSE:  Stamets filed for patents on the extract and the process used to      make it, and then he sought partners to help him commercialize a      mushroom-based anti-viral drug.  Boston investor John Norris, who      formerly served as the number two in the FDA, was interested.      Mr. JOHN NORRIS (Investor):  Not everybody is either able or willing to      be vaccinated, so a therapy is needed as well.  A therapy would allow for      people who have been exposed or who have contracted the disease to      prevent its increase within their systems.      BANSE:  Norris sees potential to sell hundreds of millions of doses to      the American, British and German germ warfare defense stockpiles.  First,      the anti-smallpox drug has to prove itself in animal trials and then get      FDA approval.  That typically takes years and often the leap from test      tube to human doesn't pan out.  Given the high stakes here, the mushroom      partners are hopeful their drug will beat the odds.      For NPR News, I'm Tom Banse in Olympia, Washington.      INSKEEP:  This is NPR News.

It's a very      high-humidity environment.       BANSE:  Stamets learned over the years that mushrooms have potent      medicinal qualities.  His curiosity was spurred to a new level by the      anthrax attacks on the East Coast late in 2001.       Mr. STAMETS:  So it came to me to be very clear that if you wanted to      fight anthrax, tapping into some of the antibiotical systems that these      mushrooms produce would be a logical first step.       BANSE:  Stamets knows humans and mushrooms have something in common:      They both get attacked by some of the same nasty microbes.  He reasoned      that it'd be worthwhile to look at mushrooms that put up the strongest      defense.  That led him to a rare type that grows on 500-year-old trees in      the Pacific Northwest.       Mr. STAMETS:  And because they're in the old-growth forest, in--under      such wet conditions, I'm real curious in how can something stay in the      woods for so long and not rot?  So I thought, well, that's a good group      to look at.       BANSE:  The wood conch group, also known as agaricon, is not your typical      mushroom.       Mr. STAMETS:  I have some over here.       BANSE:  You can look over there.       Mr. STAMETS:  Yeah.       BANSE:  Now let's get up and. . .       Stamets lifts a dried wood conch off a shelf.       Mr. STAMETS:  It looks like a beehive.  That's what I try to tell people,      is that if you look up in the woods and you see this thing that looks      like a beehive but it's not, hanging from a tree, that's what I'm      interested in.       BANSE:  Paul Stamets cultured numerous strains in his lab and prepared      natural extracts.       (Soundbite of machinery)       BANSE:  He then submitted samples to the Defense Department's BioShield      program for testing.  They went to a top-security US Army lab at Ft.      Detrick, Maryland.  Their scientists are screening tens of thousands of      natural and manmade compounds.  Drug discovery supervisor John Secrist      says the mushroom extract scored one of the rare hits.       Mr. JOHN SECRIST (Drug Discovery Supervisor):  There is consistent      activity in this one type of mushroom against viruses related to      smallpox.  They're not smallpox virus itself, but they're related to it.      So that in itself is very interesting.       BANSE:  Interesting, and as Paul Stamets realized, important, because the      US government lists smallpox among the biological agents it most fears      terrorists might use.       Mr. STAMETS:  In the queue are well-known viruses that we all know about,      but pox viruses rank at the very, very top.       BANSE:  Stamets filed for patents on the extract and the process used to      make it, and then he sought partners to help him commercialize a      mushroom-based anti-viral drug.  Boston investor John Norris, who      formerly served as the number two in the FDA, was interested.       Mr. JOHN NORRIS (Investor):  Not everybody is either able or willing to      be vaccinated, so a therapy is needed as well.  A therapy would allow for      people who have been exposed or who have contracted the disease to      prevent its increase within their systems.       BANSE:  Norris sees potential to sell hundreds of millions of doses to      the American, British and German germ warfare defense stockpiles.  First,      the anti-smallpox drug has to prove itself in animal trials and then get      FDA approval.  That typically takes years and often the leap from test      tube to human doesn't pan out.  Given the high stakes here, the mushroom      partners are hopeful their drug will beat the odds.       For NPR News, I'm Tom Banse in Olympia, Washington.       INSKEEP:  This is NPR News.

I'm Madeleine Brand. By this time tomorrow, Tour de France winner Floyd Landis should know whether a second test has found abnormal levels of testosterone in his body. The results will determine whether Landis will keep his title. Landis and his lawyer have said the tests are not always reliable. Scientists say new lab techniques make it almost impossible to explain away evidence of doping with testosterone.  NPR's Jon Hamilton reports. JON HAMILTON reporting: The test that got Landis in trouble looked at the ration of testosterone to a related substance called epitestosterone. A ratio higher than four to one constitutes a positive test. Landis reportedly had a ratio of 11 to one. But experts say a high ratio on it's on doesn't prove someone is cheating.  Dr. Harrison Pope is a psychiatrist and weight lifter at Harvard who studies doping. He says the real question is whether the tests find testosterone that could not have been produced by Landis' body. Dr. HARRISON POPE (Harvard): If there is clear evidence of synthetic testosterone, then it would seem to me it would be very difficult to explain that away.  HAMILTON: The New York Times has reported that test showed synthetic testosterone in Landis' initial sample. Pope says the technology that makes these tests possible has been around for about a decade. That's when scientists began using a clever technique to identify the source of testosterone in a sample.  Dr. POPE: By looking at the ratio of carbon isotopes in the testosterone molecules, you can distinguish naturally secreted testosterone in the body from artificial testosterone that is being injected from the outside. HAMILTON: The science here gets pretty technical, but the idea is simple. Testosterone made by pharmaceutical companies comes from plant materials, like soybeans, so it will always have a different chemical signature than testosterone made by an athlete's body. Of course, athletes can still claim they have no idea how the synthetic testosterone got there, but Pope says that's a pretty weak defense.  Dr. POPE: Testosterone is not something that you can accidentally ingest, because if you take testosterone by mouth, it is destroyed on its way through the stomach and the liver to the bloodstream. HAMILTON: So you can't just spike an athlete's Gatorade. Testosterone has to be injected or absorbed through the skin.  Dr. Richard Auchus is an endocrinologist at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas. He said there's always a small possibility that a single test can give a false positive. But Auchus says that possibility becomes vanishingly small when tests find both high levels of testosterone and the presence of synthetic testosterone.  Dr. RICHARD AUCHUS (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center): The combination of the two tests both being abnormal - oof - that's very, very unlikely to occur by chance.  HAMILTON: Auchus says testosterone and similar substances clearly help athletes add muscle over a period of weeks or months, but he says these molecules also can cause an immediate response that might help a rider in the Tour de France.  Dr. AUCHUS: There's a lot affects they have on the brain to increase aggression. They prevent post-workout soreness. So you know, they make you train harder, they make you try harder during the events. But you know, whether that actually translates into improved performance, not much information there. HAMILTON: Race officials won't need to prove that testosterone helped Floyd Landis, just that he used it. If tomorrow's tests confirm the presence of synthetic testosterone, there will no longer be a meaningful scientific question about his sample. But Dr. Don Catlin, who directs the UCLA Olympic Analytical Laboratory, says that's not likely to end the Landis affair.  Dr. DON CATLIN (UCLA Olympic Analytical Laboratory): The process of the adjudication really is just starting, because the lawyers will then begin to argue.

From the time it departs nest to its return, the average shearwater soars 40,000 miles over the ocean. Forty-thousand miles. Honey I'm home. Here's NPR's John Nielsen. JOHN NIELSEN reporting: Sooty shearwater's are small dark birds with wings that look a bit too big for their bodies.  As seabirds go, they're numerous but relatively inconspicuous, unless you happen to be standing on the rocky shore of Codfish Island off the coast of New Zealand at about the time of year when the shearwater's come home to breed in shallow tunnels. Scott Schaefer (Ornithologist, University of California, Santa Cruz): So it's quite spectacular, especially when they come back from sea, when they all come into - flying into their burrows at night - you just see clouds of them hovering the island. NIELSEN: Scott Schaefer is an ornithologist with the University of California at Santa Cruz. In a recent issue of the proceedings of the National Academy of science, he bestowed an unexpected honor on the sooty shearwater. The longest migration ever measured by science. Schaefer says the average length of one of these migrations is 40,000 miles, or to put it metrically, 30,000 kilometers each way. Mr. SCHAEFER: I think it's 15,000 kilometers around the earth, so they do that twice - you could almost think of it that way. NIELSEN: Schaefer and some colleagues captured 19 sooties on Codfish Island a few years ago. Then they tagged each bird with a lightweight tracking gizmo that takes location readings once a day. Eight months later the team re-captured the birds when they returned to Codfish Island. The information gathered by the tags showed that these birds were flying in giant figure eights back and forth across the Pacific Ocean. The migration started every April with a mass flight toward the West Coast of Chile, during which the sooties always flew less than a hundred yards above the surface of the ocean. That's where the waves bounce wind up into the air. Mr. SCHAEFER: And create these updrafts. And that's how the birds are able to exploit the wind to make flying so cheap. NIELSEN: Just before the sooties hit Chile, they land in the water and start chowing down on fish. Then after several weeks they take off again, heading northwest on trade winds. When the sooties reach Hawaii they start splitting up. Mr. SCHAEFER: To California or Alaska, or they continue northwest to Japan. NIELSEN: In all of these locations the birds come down to eat again, diving for anchovies, sardines, and squid. No one knows for sure why they end up where they do or whether certain birds return again and again to the same locations. The other thing nobody knows is why these birds all seem to turn around at the exact same time and head south in December. Mr. SCHAEFER: Something in their brain signaled them, hey it's time to return home to breed. And fairly synchronously, all the birds travel through this corridor back to New Zealand within a 10 day period. NIELSEN: From start to finish, it's an eight-month commute. Then four months later, after the breeding season is over, it starts again. Schaefer and his colleagues are now examining the links between this migration and the long-range travels of birds like albatross, fish like tuna, and ocean predators like sharks. Schaefer says he wouldn't be surprised to see the sooties loose their commuting title to one of these contenders soon. John Nielsen, NPR News, Washington.

I'm Melissa Block. MICHELE NORRIS, host: And I'm Michele Norris. Over the past two years, millions of Americans have flocked to exhibitions that display human corpses. The bodies have undergone a treatment called plastination, which hardens and preserves them. For the most part, the skin has been removed, and muscles and organs are exposed. Part science and part showmanship, the exhibits have been wildly successful and profitable for the science museums and other venues that have hosted them. Two competing companies now have seven shows underway in the United States. In the first of two stories, NPR's Neda Ulaby reports on what makes these shows so popular. A warning, some listeners may find some of the subject matter a bit disturbing. NEDA ULABY reporting: Walking into Body Worlds is slightly spooky, and it's designed to be. The rooms are theatrically shadowed and the corpses stand nude under clear pools of light. Artfully peeled musculature spreads from their bodies like wings. The corpses are adobe colored, stippled with tendon and bone. They transfix the living among them. Mr. BRUCE PEARSON(ph) (Museum visitor): Incredible. Absolutely incredible. I've never seen anything like this in my life. ULABY: Bruce Pearson visited the Denver Museum of Nature and Science with his wife and mother, both nurses. For hours, they studied two dozen bodies dramatically posed between cases of preserved human organs, their natural fluid replaced by silicone or epoxy resin. They can be molded and carved, running, leaping and opening their torsos to display their viscera and, in one case, a fetus. Mr. PEARSON: It certainly doesn't bother me the fact that they're using real bodies for this. It really doesn't bother me at all. You know, to me, when you die, your body's just a shell anyway, so it really doesn't matter what happens to the flesh part of it. Ms. CHARLOTTE CONN(ph): It's just amazing. ULABY: That's Charlotte Conn, a volunteer at the Denver Museum. It received over half a million visitors during Body Worlds' five month run. Conn was inspecting glass-like slices of what looks like petrified prosciutto. It's actually human being. Ms. CONN: It just shows us that we're, you know, beautifully made. ULABY: There's something forbiddingly intimate about peering into dead human bodies. That partly explains why for many hundreds of years in Europe anatomy was taboo, says Michael Sapple(ph). He's a cultural historian of anatomy who works at the National Library of Medicine. He says a whiff of the elicit still clings. Mr. MICHAEL SAPPLE (National Library of Medicine): Anatomy is transgressive. Anatomy deals with dead bodies. Anatomy is both the exemplary science of the enlightenment and a death cult. It's a dark science. ULABY: Still, Sapple says back around the turn of the century, most American cities had at least one anatomical museum, and they've been around since the Renaissance. One of the most notable ones was in Amsterdam in the 1600s and 1700s. It belonged to a respectable Dutch anatomist named Frederic Rouche. Mr. SAPPLE: Rouche made these very, very fanciful anatomical displays of fetal and infant skeletons cavorting in jungles of human body parts. Sometimes they're posed as if they were crying, and they're holding tissues that are made of actual human tissue. ULABY: Believe it or not. This was understood as a serious scientific endeavor. So were anatomical illustrations showing cadavers in whimsical poses, like removing their own skin. You'll see those same poses replicated in today's exhibitions, says Joel-Peter Witkin. He's a photographer whose work is as acclaimed as it is unsettling. His black and white still-lifes feature pieces of unclaimed corpses. Witkin says the plastinated bodies just don't move him. Mr. JOEL-PETER WITKIN (Photographer): Homer wrote that sleep is the dream of death. And I think that the specimens that people look at in these spectacles look as though they're dreaming. Most of them don't evoke the actual presence and emotion of human beings. ULABY: That's maybe why the exhibition works, says Petra Cuppers. She's a professor who studies medicine and culture. She says the thrill of being near the dead is mediated by the plastination process. Professor PETRA CUPPERS (Medicine and Culture Scholar): You don't actually see, smell, touch real dead flesh. What you see is a strangely replaced plastic copy of a human corpse. Death seems to be very much held at bay. We don't have that emotional connection that allows us to understand that this person is dead, and I think that is what makes it acceptable to many people. ULABY: People like Debbie Stewart, a fitness instructor visiting a cadaver show in New York. Ms. DEBBIE STEWART (Fitness Instructor): These are real. I've never seen anything so, you know, I've never seen a cadaver. Basically, that's what this is, you know, looking at a cadaver taken apart. Mr. JEFF RUDOLPH (California Science Center): To see the real thing is so much more meaningful and more powerful than to see a video of it or a photograph or a model. ULABY: Jeff Rudolph is CEO of the California Science Center, the first to exhibit cadavers in the U. S. It had to stay open around the clock to accommodate massive crowds during the exhibition's final days. Rudolph says the popularity comes from the wonders of plastination. The process can preserve tiny capillaries, fine as embroidery threads, and remove everything else. Mr. RUDOLPH: You can see the individuality of each specimen and really get a chance to understand in a way that I don't believe anything else does how the body functions and what can go wrong with it. ULABY: The science centers like to tout the educational value and public-health benefits of displaying vascular systems and smokers' lungs. But Dr. Howard Marquel thinks there's something a little voyeuristic about the shows. He's a physician who also directs the Center for the History of Medicine at the University of Michigan. Marquel wonders what new thrill people may hunger for when cadaver shows become pass\u00e9. Dr. HOWARD MARQUEL (University of Michigan): We love to see shows where there's blood and guts. There's shows on cable television where you can see operations being done, and stakes just keep being raised higher and higher and higher with each passing year. ULABY: That becomes clear when talking with the founder of Body Worlds, one of the cadaver shows. Dr. Gunther Von Hagens is a German anatomist who says his primary mission is teaching people about their bodies, which he does sensationally. Von Hagens once conducted an autopsy live on British television. In Europe, he displayed plastinates in places like an old slaughterhouse and a defunct museum of erotic art. Dr. GUNTHER VON HAGENS (Founder, Body Worlds): Of course, I'm a little showman, but a good teacher has always to be a little showman to entertain his audience. ULABY: Recently, Von Hagens sent a questionnaire to 6,500 people he says have agreed to donate their bodies to him after death. Von Hagens asked those future donors a number of provocative questions. For example, would they consent to their body parts being mixed with an animal's to create a mythological creature? And then he asked -Dr. VON HAGENS: Would you agree to be become transformed into an act of love with a woman or a man when it comes to that? Very interesting that the majority of men liked it but the majority of women didn't. Dr. MARQUEL: I've got to tell you, that's truly troubling. ULABY: Again, Dr. Howard Marquel. But that immediate reaction changed after a moment of reflection, as he toggled between ordinary person and medical ethicist. Dr. MARQUEL: If somebody consents to do that, live and let live or die and let die, I guess. ULABY: Marquel echoes many in the medical profession who feel that as long as cadaver exhibitions obtain their bodies ethically from informed donors, there's no real problem. But he worries about shortcuts and cheap knockoffs. An infamous San Francisco show last year featured bodies prepared improperly, perhaps hastily. The silicone was found to be beading on the body's skin. Marquel also worries that the two major exhibitors in the U. S. do not provide a clear paper trail that proves their cadavers are who they're supposed to be. Dr. MARQUEL: My medical ethics would compel me to have as pristine and as transparent a catalogue and record of consent, the bodies and what they were agreed to when they were living and so on as possible, and I would display it at the drop of a hat. It seems to me that as these exhibitions become more and more popular, that the public ought to demand that. And they ought to demand it of themselves, too. ULABY: Whether that public finds cadaver exhibitions repulsive or engrossing, they keep turning out for them. Over 20 million worldwide, according to the show's producers. Many of those visitors find themselves wondering, who were all those people? Where did all the bodies come from? Those questions linger around America's new love affair with corpses on display.

Mr. PEARSON: It certainly doesn't bother me the fact that they're using real bodies for this. It really doesn't bother me at all. You know, to me, when you die, your body's just a shell anyway, so it really doesn't matter what happens to the flesh part of it.  Ms. CHARLOTTE CONN(ph): It's just amazing.  ULABY: That's Charlotte Conn, a volunteer at the Denver Museum. It received over half a million visitors during Body Worlds' five month run. Conn was inspecting glass-like slices of what looks like petrified prosciutto. It's actually human being.  Ms. CONN: It just shows us that we're, you know, beautifully made.  ULABY: There's something forbiddingly intimate about peering into dead human bodies. That partly explains why for many hundreds of years in Europe anatomy was taboo, says Michael Sapple(ph). He's a cultural historian of anatomy who works at the National Library of Medicine. He says a whiff of the elicit still clings.  Mr. MICHAEL SAPPLE (National Library of Medicine): Anatomy is transgressive. Anatomy deals with dead bodies. Anatomy is both the exemplary science of the enlightenment and a death cult. It's a dark science.  ULABY: Still, Sapple says back around the turn of the century, most American cities had at least one anatomical museum, and they've been around since the Renaissance. One of the most notable ones was in Amsterdam in the 1600s and 1700s. It belonged to a respectable Dutch anatomist named Frederic Rouche.  Mr. SAPPLE: Rouche made these very, very fanciful anatomical displays of fetal and infant skeletons cavorting in jungles of human body parts. Sometimes they're posed as if they were crying, and they're holding tissues that are made of actual human tissue.  ULABY: Believe it or not. This was understood as a serious scientific endeavor. So were anatomical illustrations showing cadavers in whimsical poses, like removing their own skin.  You'll see those same poses replicated in today's exhibitions, says Joel-Peter Witkin. He's a photographer whose work is as acclaimed as it is unsettling. His black and white still-lifes feature pieces of unclaimed corpses. Witkin says the plastinated bodies just don't move him.  Mr. JOEL-PETER WITKIN (Photographer): Homer wrote that sleep is the dream of death. And I think that the specimens that people look at in these spectacles look as though they're dreaming. Most of them don't evoke the actual presence and emotion of human beings.  ULABY: That's maybe why the exhibition works, says Petra Cuppers. She's a professor who studies medicine and culture. She says the thrill of being near the dead is mediated by the plastination process.  Professor PETRA CUPPERS (Medicine and Culture Scholar): You don't actually see, smell, touch real dead flesh. What you see is a strangely replaced plastic copy of a human corpse. Death seems to be very much held at bay. We don't have that emotional connection that allows us to understand that this person is dead, and I think that is what makes it acceptable to many people.  ULABY: People like Debbie Stewart, a fitness instructor visiting a cadaver show in New York.  Ms. DEBBIE STEWART (Fitness Instructor): These are real. I've never seen anything so, you know, I've never seen a cadaver. Basically, that's what this is, you know, looking at a cadaver taken apart.  Mr. JEFF RUDOLPH (California Science Center): To see the real thing is so much more meaningful and more powerful than to see a video of it or a photograph or a model.  ULABY: Jeff Rudolph is CEO of the California Science Center, the first to exhibit cadavers in the U. S. It had to stay open around the clock to accommodate massive crowds during the exhibition's final days. Rudolph says the popularity comes from the wonders of plastination. The process can preserve tiny capillaries, fine as embroidery threads, and remove everything else.  Mr. RUDOLPH: You can see the individuality of each specimen and really get a chance to understand in a way that I don't believe anything else does how the body functions and what can go wrong with it.  ULABY: The science centers like to tout the educational value and public-health benefits of displaying vascular systems and smokers' lungs. But Dr. Howard Marquel thinks there's something a little voyeuristic about the shows. He's a physician who also directs the Center for the History of Medicine at the University of Michigan. Marquel wonders what new thrill people may hunger for when cadaver shows become pass\u00e9.  Dr. HOWARD MARQUEL (University of Michigan): We love to see shows where there's blood and guts. There's shows on cable television where you can see operations being done, and stakes just keep being raised higher and higher and higher with each passing year.  ULABY: That becomes clear when talking with the founder of Body Worlds, one of the cadaver shows. Dr. Gunther Von Hagens is a German anatomist who says his primary mission is teaching people about their bodies, which he does sensationally. Von Hagens once conducted an autopsy live on British television. In Europe, he displayed plastinates in places like an old slaughterhouse and a defunct museum of erotic art.  Dr. GUNTHER VON HAGENS (Founder, Body Worlds): Of course, I'm a little showman, but a good teacher has always to be a little showman to entertain his audience.  ULABY: Recently, Von Hagens sent a questionnaire to 6,500 people he says have agreed to donate their bodies to him after death. Von Hagens asked those future donors a number of provocative questions. For example, would they consent to their body parts being mixed with an animal's to create a mythological creature? And then he asked - Dr. VON HAGENS: Would you agree to be become transformed into an act of love with a woman or a man when it comes to that? Very interesting that the majority of men liked it but the majority of women didn't.  Dr. MARQUEL: I've got to tell you, that's truly troubling.  ULABY: Again, Dr. Howard Marquel. But that immediate reaction changed after a moment of reflection, as he toggled between ordinary person and medical ethicist.  Dr. MARQUEL: If somebody consents to do that, live and let live or die and let die, I guess.  ULABY: Marquel echoes many in the medical profession who feel that as long as cadaver exhibitions obtain their bodies ethically from informed donors, there's no real problem. But he worries about shortcuts and cheap knockoffs. An infamous San Francisco show last year featured bodies prepared improperly, perhaps hastily. The silicone was found to be beading on the body's skin.  Marquel also worries that the two major exhibitors in the U. S. do not provide a clear paper trail that proves their cadavers are who they're supposed to be.  Dr. MARQUEL: My medical ethics would compel me to have as pristine and as transparent a catalogue and record of consent, the bodies and what they were agreed to when they were living and so on as possible, and I would display it at the drop of a hat. It seems to me that as these exhibitions become more and more popular, that the public ought to demand that. And they ought to demand it of themselves, too.  ULABY: Whether that public finds cadaver exhibitions repulsive or engrossing, they keep turning out for them. Over 20 million worldwide, according to the show's producers. Many of those visitors find themselves wondering, who were all those people? Where did all the bodies come from? Those questions linger around America's new love affair with corpses on display.

You and Leo, I understand, arrived last night, at London's Heathrow Airport before all of the terrible news of today broke. But tell us, how is Leo doing? Dr. PAT THOMAS (Curator of Mammals, Bronx Zoo): Hi, Lynn. Leo's doing fine. He is a little bit jet-lagged, as are the team that went to bring him back from Pakistan, but he's eating well, drinking well and adjusting to his new surroundings. NEARY: How many snow leopards do you have there, and is he joining in with those snow leopards right away? Dr. THOMAS: Well, prior to Leo, we had 12, four males and eight females, and right now Leo is in a quarantine area, which is something we do for all animals entering our collection for their health as well as protecting the health of the animals already in the zoo. Following this 30-day quarantine, he will be introduced to some of our snow leopards at our snow leopard facility. NEARY: It's kind of a fascinating story that this snow leopard was found by a shepherd and hand fed. Dr. THOMAS: Right. We don't know the complete story of how the cub was found, but a shepherd did finally, when he was probably less than two months old, in a region of Pakistan called the Naltar Valley, and took care of him for a short period of time before realizing that he really didn't have the expertise and ability, financial ability, to care for Leo, and so he turned him -NEARY: Is it unusual for you to get a snow leopard from the wild like this? I mean, are most of them -Dr. THOMAS: To take a snow leopard from the wild? Yes, it's actually quite unusual. The vast majority of all mammals in zoos are those that are captive-bred, and our reasons for taking Leo were essentially three-fold. One, we wanted to provide for the welfare of this cub. There, at the present time, is not an adequate facility in Pakistan for snow leopards, so we wanted to provide a good home for Leo. It was also an opportunity for us to enhance the genetic diversity of the snow leopard population in North American zoos, which is managed cooperatively by the zoos that do keep the species in North America. NEARY: And the third reason? Dr. THOMAS: Well, it was a chance to strengthen the bonds between the Wildlife Conservation Society, which is our parent organization, and various Pakistani wildlife agencies.

Britain has cancelled all flights today between London's Heathrow Airport and points in Britain, Europe, and Libya. In this country, Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff confirmed at a news conference this morning that this plot involved liquid explosives, apparently to be carried aboard aircraft, possibly a separate component to be put together aboard the plane. Joining us now to discuss liquid explosives is NPR science correspondent Jon Hamilton.  Good morning. JON HAMILTON reporting: Good morning. MONTAGNE: And Jon, why would a terrorist want to use liquid explosives? I mean, I can figure out that it's easier to get on the plane at this moment, but that and what else? HAMILTON: Well, they're relatively easy to make or to buy. You can make them out of household items like acetone, which is really just nail polish remover and hair bleach, which is hydrogen peroxide. And they are very hard to detect, as we talked about before. And they can be very powerful explosives. It doesn't take a lot to make a very big bang. MONTAGNE: And how do you set these things off, and, I guess, intentionally rather than accidentally? HAMILTON: Well, I was going to say, the biggest problem is how not to set them off. The explosive that people are probably most familiar with is nitroglycerine, and Alfred Nobel, when he was working on discovering this, nearly blew himself up. And that's been the entire history of liquid explosives, is that once they are put together, they can be set off by almost anything.  And so, once they're on a plane, for instance, you could set them off with a little bit of electricity as has been tried. A couple of nine volt batteries would do it. Friction, shock, heat, and in some cases, even light. So setting these things off is not a problem. MONTAGNE: How about bringing down a big passenger airliner? How much liquid explosive would one need? HAMILTON: Well, certainly, it depends on which liquid explosive you're talking about. Nitroglycerine, for instance, is very powerful and if you think about the amount of nitroglycerine that you could put in, say, a modest-size contact lens solution container, that would be enough blow a very big hole in an airplane. And of course, you don't have to blow up the whole airplane to bring an airplane down. For instance, if you set off a relatively small explosion, but it happens to be near the fuel tanks, you can get a much bigger explosion. And so, it really depends on where it is and how much goes off, but as far as finding enough of this stuff to - or getting enough of this stuff on an airplane to bring down an airliner, it's not a whole lot. MONTAGNE: Now, we haven't heard this morning any announcement of what type of liquid explosive exactly these suspects were suspected of using, but what would you guess or what would you know? HAMILTON: Well, we have two things to go on. One is history, and in the past, al-Qaida has favored nitroglycerine. There's a plot that took place in the Philippines that sounds a little similar to this one that involved the use of nitroglycerine. However, some of the remarks that Chertoff made suggest that maybe it was something a little more complicated. He suggested that perhaps there was a plan to mix elements together on the plane. That would solve the problem of the explosive being so volatile. The problem with these is once they're mixed, they tend to go off.  So if you - they would be easier to detect if it weren't mixed until you got on the plane, and that opens up a whole range of liquid explosives and we just don't know which one at this point.

I'm Melissa Block. MICHELE NORRIS, Host: And I'm Michele Norris. For two years now, exhibitions of human cadavers have been traveling the country. The corpses in these shows have been preserved and solidified through a process called plastination. Often, their outer layers are peeled back to reveal their organs or joints or muscles. The exhibitions have been widely successful around the world selling millions of tickets earning tens of millions of dollars in the U. S. alone. Not surprisingly, they've often been dumped by criticism. As NPR's Neda Ulaby reports, one delicate ethical concern stands out above all others. NEDA ULABY: At the Body Worlds II Exhibition, the corpses are ice dancing and skateboarding. They're doing yoga. Stripped of their skin, they're creatures of muscle, robustly red as they're suffused with oxygen. Ironically, each is a picture of health. GUNTHER VON HAGENS: Body Worlds is not gory. It shows the beauty of the body. ULABY: That's Dr. Gunther von Hagens at the Denver Museum of Nature and Science last spring. He's the anatomist who invented plastination, a process by which the bodies are preserved by removing the fluid and replacing it with silicone or epoxy resin. And his signature black hat and leather vest, von Hagens is also Body Worlds' impresario. VON HAGENS: I believe this is the real democratized age of anatomy. Anybody, any lay person has access to the beauty beneath the skin. ULABY: Of course, they have to pay $25 to get in. But many visitors, like tourist, Angel Campos (ph) from New Mexico say it's worth every cent. Campos says Body Worlds is like wondering through an anamtomy textbook. But the plastinates do give him (inaudible). ANGEL CAMPOS: I wonder who they were. I wonder how they got here. ULABY: And that is the key ethical question. Whether the bodies were legitimately obtained. According to von Hagens, in the science museums that show his work, every whole body exhibited in North America comes from fully informed European and American donors who get permission in writing for their bodies to be displayed. Gunther von Hagens sat down with NPR in an airy museaum conference room to discuss where the bodies came from. VON HAGENS: What I certainly never used for public exhibitions are unclaimed bodies, prisoners, bodies from mental institutions or even executed prisoners. ULABY: Allegations and controversies have followed von Hagens around the world. He's something of a multinational corporation. Most of von Hagens' plasination is done in his main laboratory, which is moved from Germany to Kyrgyztan, and the Peoples Republic of China. VON HAGENS: The Chinese are better in dissection skills. They have the patience, which we, in Europe, don't have. They're fine muscle dexterity is necessary to pulling those specimen of the high quality. ULABY: Chinese medical schools supply von Hagens with unclaimed bodies, which he plastinates and sells to medical schools around the world. Von Hagens used to take cadavers from the Former Soviet Union. But he stopped after body trafficking scandals in Russia and the Kyrgyz Republic. Customs officials, from years ago, intercepted 56 bodies and hundreds of brain samples sent from the Novosibirsk Medical Academy to von Hagens' Heidelberg lab. The cadavers were traced to a Russian medical examiner, who, last year, was convicted of illegally selling the bodies of homeless people, prisoners and indigent hospital patients. Von Hagens was not charged with any wrongdoing. And he maintains categorically that his cadavers were obtained only through proper legal and ethical channels. VON HAGENS: It's so nice to sensationalize this most successful traveling exhibition on earth since 10 years by bringing out from kind of (inaudible) stories. ULABY: Still, NPR has learned that no clear paper trail leads from mourning donors to exhibited bodies. People donating their bodies to von Hagens sent consent forms to his Institute for Plastination. They paid to have their bodies transported to a plastination facility. There, their donor forms and death certificates are checked. That paperwork is then separated from the bodies, which could be used for displays or sold in pieces to medical schools. No one will know for sure because each plastinated corpse is made anonymous to protect its privacy. This is Hans-Martin Sass. He's a philosophy professor with the specialty in ethics. He was hired by the California Science Center to investigate Body Worlds before the show's US debut in 2004. HANS: And just sent me to Heidelberg to compare the donation forms with the death certificates, in order to make sure that the people who signed the donation form, both whole body donation form, actually had died. ULABY: Sass matched over 200 donor forms to death certificates. But he did not match the death certificates and donation forms to the specific bodies von Hagens has on display. SASS: He has made a firewall between the real person and the plastinated body. ULABY: I understand the point of the firewall for the general public. They're eager for a journalist like me. But it seems that an emphasis, to see all of it is, to make sure that the bodies being exhibited do belong to the people who say that they donated them. It might be important to verify. SASS: Yes. And I should tell you very frankly, I had an exchange with Mr. von Hagens about it. ULABY: But Sass came to agree with von Hagens' policy on anonymity, and approved the exhibition. Although, whether the bodies are from informed donors comes down to von Hagens' word. Sass' ethical report was central to the California Science Center's review, and has been used to support each exhibition of Body Worlds in North America. Science Center consultant, Sheila Grinell. SHEILA GRINELL: It's hard. Science Center's don't have a way, really, of going back and taking every single detail of the prominence of all those bodies. ULABY: Grinell says Body Worlds provided a windfall for science museums, which like other cultural institutions have faced attendance and funding struggles. Still, she does not believe they've cut ethical corners. GRINELL: The museum leaders are following the controversy. Nobody wants to get a black eye. Everybody wants to increase their audience. ULABY: And they have. Body Worlds three U. S. shows have drawn so far over 3 million visitors. Body Worlds, by the way, should not be confused with its competitor, Bodies: The Exhibition. Gunther von Hagens Body Worlds is now in St. Paul, Houston and Boston. Bodies: The Exhibition is in Tampa, Atlanta, Las Vegas and New York City. It's spokesman is retired professor, Roy Glover. He says its cadavers, all from China, did not come from willing donors. ROY GLOVER: They're unclaimed. We don't hide from it. We address it right upfront. ULABY: For that reason, many venues will not display Bodies: The Exhibition. Groups like the Laogai Research Foundation, which documents human rights abuse in China have charged the category of unclaimed bodies in China includes executed political prisoners. Harry Wu founded the group and he's testified before Congress on China's organ trade. Wu says rampant corruption in totalitarian China makes it impossible to compare with the U. S. And he says, he is not impressed by claims that the cadavers came to the exhibition legally. HARRY WU: This is the law, Chinese law, right? Legal, right? Chinese do everything legal by their law, legal. ULABY: It was perfectly legal to bring Chinese cadavers here as educational specimens, but the Chinese government has cracked down on the cadaver trade, banning export this month except for medical research. Arnie Geller is president of Premier Exhibitions, the company that brought the bodies from China. ARNIE GELLER: I guess we'll be looking in other areas of the world for experts who can do this work. ULABY: Geller and his spokesman, Roy Glover, say it's unfair to link Bodies: The Exhibition with dark assessments of International Cadaver Regulations. GLOVER: People can raise those issues, but I think they've been addressed successfully and satisfactorily. ULABY: But when Bodies: The Exhibition opened first in Tampa, Florida last summer, the state anatomical board requested documentation proving the corpses were ethically obtained. Dr. Lynn Romrell who chairs the board says it got only a letter from the show's Chinese plastinator asserting that they were. LYNN ROMRELL: He stated that none of the material came from criminal institutions or comes from mentally insane. But just his word on that, no documents. ULABY: Romrell wanted to close the exhibition down, but he says that the state anatomical board lacks the authority. He says, still, he's not against the exhibition in principle. ROMRELL: If they had signed statements from donors that I release my body for public display and for a company to profit from the public display of my body, I couldn't argue against that but they don't that kind of documentation. ULABY: The owner of Body Worlds, Gunther von Hagens, says each body each displays can be accounted for but he's unwilling to make public a complete paper trail. His competition, Bodies the Exhibition, relies on documentation from a country with a problematic human rights record where even at best its exhibitors say the bodies were not formally donated by people who agreed to be displayed. Yet despite questions about the two exhibitions both continue to draw hundreds of thousands of visitors around the country. And some museums are even thinking about adding plastinates to their permanent collection. Neda Ulaby, NPR News. BLOCK: You can hear Neda Ulaby's report on the popularity of the Body World exhibit and see images and video from it at npr. org. MELISSA BLOCK, Host:  From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Melissa Block. MICHELE NORRIS, Host:  And I'm Michele Norris. For two years now, exhibitions of human cadavers have been traveling the country. The corpses in these shows have been preserved and solidified through a process called plastination. Often, their outer layers are peeled back to reveal their organs or joints or muscles. The exhibitions have been widely successful around the world selling millions of tickets earning tens of millions of dollars in the U. S. alone. Not surprisingly, they've often been dumped by criticism. As NPR's Neda Ulaby reports, one delicate ethical concern stands out above all others. NEDA ULABY: At the Body Worlds II Exhibition, the corpses are ice dancing and skateboarding. They're doing yoga. Stripped of their skin, they're creatures of muscle, robustly red as they're suffused with oxygen. Ironically, each is a picture of health. GUNTHER VON HAGENS: Body Worlds is not gory. It shows the beauty of the body. ULABY: That's Dr. Gunther von Hagens at the Denver Museum of Nature and Science last spring. He's the anatomist who invented plastination, a process by which the bodies are preserved by removing the fluid and replacing it with silicone or epoxy resin. And his signature black hat and leather vest, von Hagens is also Body Worlds' impresario. VON HAGENS: I believe this is the real democratized age of anatomy. Anybody, any lay person has access to the beauty beneath the skin. ULABY: Of course, they have to pay $25 to get in. But many visitors, like tourist, Angel Campos (ph) from New Mexico say it's worth every cent. Campos says Body Worlds is like wondering through an anamtomy textbook. But the plastinates do give him (inaudible). ANGEL CAMPOS: I wonder who they were. I wonder how they got here. ULABY: And that is the key ethical question.

But scientists are working on updating screening technologies, as NPR's Nell Boyce reports. NELL BOYCE reporting: After September 11th, if you tried to get on a plane with a cup of coffee, you might have been asked to take a sip to prove that it wasn't some deadly explosive. But there are companies out there that would like to sell airports a more high-tech test. Here's one promotional video from a company called ID Detection Systems. (Soundbite of video) ANNOUNCER: This individual is attempting to check through what appears to be a sealed bottle of vodka. But is it vodka? The Idex 1000 can tell - and guess what? It's lighter fluid. BOYCE: Sealed bottles do pose a security problem, and it's not a new one. After a Korean jetliner went down in 1987, investigators said bombers had set off a bottle of explosive liquid. That same year, German airport officials recognized a wanted man. Mr. CLINT SEWARD (General Dielectrics): They stopped him and they looked at four bottles of wine he was carrying, and the bottles of wine had a liquid explosive in them. BOYCE: Clint Seward works for a company called General Dielectrics near Boston. He says those events sparked interest in new screening technologies. The device Stewart developed relies on a tiny burst of microwaves. Water-based drinks like coffee respond differently than liquids used in explosives. Mr. SEWARD: You actually take the bottle out yourself, put it on the device, the operator pushes three buttons and it takes three seconds. BOYCE: But this device can't see through metal, and it won't tell you exactly what a liquid is. Other devices take different approaches. One shoots a laser through glass or clear plastic.

One government report last year said that money problems have caused delays. It said TSA had been forced to divert of one year's entire R&D budget to other uses, like paying for personnel. Still, several of these devices have been tested in airports. Robin Zimmer works at ID Detection Systems in Knoxville. He says real world assessments are essential. Mr. ROBIN ZIMMER (ID Detection Systems): There is an awful lot to getting a technology tested thoroughly so you know it's going to work and it's reliable, and then getting it implemented in various checkpoints around the country and around the world is a big job.

I'm Neal Conan, in Washington. For the past two years, an exhibit called Body Worlds has been touring the United States and attracting a lot of visitors. It features beautifully preserved, skinless cadavers, theatrically lit and dramatically posed, riding a horse maybe or playing chess. It's success spawned competition, including a show called Bodies: The Exhibit. Presenters say the displays educate visitors about anatomy and the wonders of the human body and that their popularity is a boon for under-funded science museums. But some wonder who these people were and where they came from. Did they agree to have their bodies used like this? Are public displays of cadavers education, entertainment or freak shows? Like it or not, producers say 20 million people around the world have now visited these exhibits over the past 10 years and that business is booming. Later in the program, we'll go to Mexico City, where protests continue following the disputed presidential election there, and to Lebanon for an update on efforts to get humanitarian supplies to the southern part of the country. But first, cadavers and controversy. If you visited one of these shows, what did you think? Did you have reservations? Our number here in Washington is 800-989-8255. That's 800-989-TALK. The e-mail address is talk@npr. org. Neda Ulaby is cultural reporter for NPR. She did a series of stories on the exhibit you may have heard on ALL THINGS CONSIDERED last week. And she joins us now in Studio 3A. Thanks very much for being on the show. NEDA ULABY reporting: Thank you, Neal. CONAN: When you visited these exhibitions, what did you think? ULABY: They're extraordinary. I don't think it would be - I think it would be near impossible to go to one of these exhibits to not be profoundly moved. And one of the things that really startled me when I went to them, and I went to three of them. I saw Bodies: The Exhibition in New York City, and I saw Body Worlds in Philadelphia and Body Worlds 2 in Denver. And there were so many people of so many ages who had such an incredible range of responses to these exhibitions. I spoke to scientists who were marveling over the incredible skill with which these dissections were done. And I talked to people who identified themselves as very deeply religious people from a number of faiths who felt that this reaffirmed their feeling that, for example, that evolution was a myth and that only God could have created something as beautiful as a human being in the sort of perfect form. CONAN: You mentioned Body Worlds. This has spawned - I mean, not only, it's spawned competition, it's spawned spin-offs. They have various iterations of this show traveling in different parts of the country. ULABY: Two major exhibition distributors in the United States and then a third that's just started to get a foothold. Worldwide, there are perhaps eight or 10. It's a little hard to tell because a lot of these body exhibition companies abroad are, frankly, quite shady. CONAN: There's also a big distinction between the two in this country, one of which are the Body Worlds. They say they know where all these bodies came from and that these people all gave permission, that this has been ethically cleared. And the other exhibition says, no, these are bodies that were unclaimed. We got them from China, and that's where we got them. ULABY: That's correct. Gunther von Hagens's Body Worlds, which had its first exhibition in Japan in 1996, says that all of the bodies, all of the whole bodies, he exhibits in North America come from European and American donors. He says that he never has ever used bodies that came to him in any kind of unethical way. He also plastinates bodies for sale in medical schools. Those do not necessarily come from donated bodies. Bodies: The Exhibition only uses bodies from China, unclaimed bodies, in their North American exhibitions. CONAN: Yet even this Gunther von Hagens, he does not - these are all anonymous. He doesn't put any specific piece of paperwork with a specific body, cadaver. And as you say, these have been - well, tell us a little bit about the process by which they're preserved. ULABY: The process is called plastination. It's a process that was invented by Dr. Gunther von Hagens, and it's a really extraordinary process. The way it works is all of the fluid is removed from a corpse, not necessarily a human corpse, by the way. When you go to some of these shows, you'll see animals preserved. And seeing them in their glory is also quite magnificent. So what this process does is all of the fluid is taken out of a body and replaced with polymer. It's such an incredibly delicate process that, for example, all of the veins in a body can be filled with this plastinate and everything else can be stripped away so all that you see is a cloudlike form of veins, some of which are so tiny it's like filigree. It's beautiful. CONAN: Well. Let's get some listeners involved in the conversation. 800-989-8255 if you'd like to join us, 800-989-TALK. Our e-mail address is talk@nprnews. And let's get - we'll begin with Ebony. Ebony's calling us from Cleveland. EBONY (Caller): Hi. CONAN: Hi, you're on the air. Go ahead, please. EBONY: Yeah, I just wanted to comment that I went to the exhibit here in Cleveland. I think we have Body Worlds 2. I thought it was awesome, one of the best things I've ever seen in my life, except for some of the positions he had females in. I thought it was a little risqu\u00e9, and maybe I'm being biased because I am a female, but you could really read a lot into some of the positions. But the overall work I thought was totally awesome, and I recommend anyone to go see it, which it was kind of hard trying to find someone to even go with me. But I thought it was awesome. CONAN: Hard to find somebody to go with you because people felt a little skittish about it. EBONY: Yeah or exactly, right. They're like, oh no, you know, you're sick and all that kind of stuff. And I'm thinking, you know, we can learn a lot from this, which I learned quite a lot. CONAN: So you don't feel like a ghoul at all. EBONY: No, not at all. CONAN: And, on the other hand, if - I understand that they put out requests for people to donate their bodies after they die, would you consider donating yours? EBONY: I've always considered it. I think that's the best way to learn. I think more people should do it. I am a spiritual person. I do believe that we will go on, but my body can be used for anyone to learn whatever they need to learn from it. I think that would awesome. CONAN: All right, Ebony. Thanks very much for the call. Appreciate it. EBONY: Thank you. CONAN: Does she reflect a number of the people that you talked with, Neda? ULABY: Absolutely. And one thing that I've heard from many people is when you first walk into in particular the Body Worlds exhibition, which are famous for the flair and the drama with which they're presented, the farther and farther you go into these exhibitions, the more baroque and, some would say, over the top the poses are. It's not at all uncommon to see a body turned, more or less, into a chest of drawers. The name of that body in particular is actually the Drawer Man. Some would find these whimsical and cute how either the body is pulled out in these sort of drawer-like ways or exploded in other ways. Others might find them gratuitous. Dr. von Hagens himself says that each one of these poses, even the ones that Ebony finds a little tasteless, he says that each one of these poses is intended to illustrate a particular anatomical principle. CONAN: And he signs them, as if they are works of art. ULABY: That is a fairly new development for him, and that comes in the wake of copyright disputes that he's had over competing exhibitions and the way they've arranged and plastinated their bodies. CONAN: Let's get another caller on the line, Kim. Kim also calling from Cleveland. KIM (Caller): Yes, I'm a nursing student, and I went to see it in Cleveland. And I went with my professor, actually, and we spent hours with our books open and laying on the floor and identifying all the different body parts and veins, and it was just fascinating. CONAN: So you took this as an anatomy lesson. KIM: It was an anatomy lesson. But I actually, that was the second time I saw it. I was able to attend the opening in Cleveland with my husband for my anniversary present. And so I actually got to see all the bodies as I had heavy hors d'oeuvres and a glass of wine, so it was actually very interesting. CONAN: I suspect you won't forget it. KIM: No, definitely not. There was something interesting. The same person that did this exhibit, Dr. von whatever his last name is. CONAN: Hagens, yeah. KIM: I was in London a couple of months ago and watching TV, my husband and I, and he actually has a live autopsy show where he does an autopsy with a live audience and kind of goes through whatever ailment this person had or what they died from and then has a human model that he can point out on them where he's going to start cutting. It was - my husband said it was kind of like a train wreck. He couldn't stop watching. CONAN: Mm-hmm. ULABY: Be it may, I ask the caller if you had any discussions in your class with your professor about the ethics of such exhibitions and about the sort of collision of entertainment and education. KIM: The only thing that we - the way we handled it is it was not considered a fieldtrip. We met our professor there, and we made our choice to go individually. You didn't have to attend. Because there were some people that really didn't think that it was a correct thing to do. CONAN: There are medical schools in Cleveland where people - medical students -do autopsies as a matter of course, as part of their instruction. Kim, you could have presumably just gone, taken the class to go see one of those. KIM: True, you probably could have, but I don't know. It was just, as people were saying, in the different positions that they put these people in, it's just so amazing to see the muscles actually work. It's almost like a lesson in movement because they change every time someone changes their position. CONAN: And I guess, Neda, I'm old enough to remember those plastic models that you bought, you were given as kids. The Visible Man and the Visible Woman. Certain parts were omitted, but anyway, I'm sure there are rather more complicated versions - I've seen them in museums. That's a difference between you know plastic, real plastic, and plasticized cadavers. KIM: Right. You can really see all of the different things that can happen. And he also has a huge section on what happens if you smoke and what happens if you drink. And so you really got to see what a black lung looked like, and it was much more I think moving than seeing a picture of it. ULABY: Now when I interviewed Dr. von Hagens in Denver at the show there, one of the things he told me was that he chose to exhibit the bodies in this very kind of dynamic way because he had tried showing them in Japan in the first exhibition laid out in similar ways as you might see in an anatomical lab, and he said that it freaked people out, that they looked spooky. They looked like ghosts. They looked, in short, like corpses. And some critics would say that perhaps by exhibiting these bodies in these tremendously dynamic poses to a certain extent it takes - it adds an element of unreality to it, that you're -CONAN: Abstracted. ULABY: - but from the death and from the fact that these were actual human beings. CONAN: Did you think of them as real human beings, Kim? KIM: You know I have to admit in a way I thought of them more as works of art because of the way they were set out, and the only thing that - I chose to go but my husband didn't - behind a curtain you could go to see, they actually had fetuses inside someone's body at different stages of development. And my husband knew he couldn't handle that, and I knew that I could. So there were things that you actually got to decide can I go that step further? CONAN: Kim, thanks very much for joining us. Appreciate the phone call. KIM: Thank you, bye-bye. CONAN: There are, as she mentioned, exhibits of fetuses and fetuses in human body, also of children, which raise questions about consent and other ethical issues. We're going to be talking about those with two ethicists when we come back from a break. If you'd like to join the conversation, again, our number is 800-989-8255, 800-989-TALK. Our e-mail address is talk@npr. org. I'm Neal Conan. It's the TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. (Soundbite of music) This is TALK OF THE NATION. I'm Neal Conan, in Washington. We're talking today about the popularity of body exhibits and taking your calls. If you've been to one of these exhibits, give us a ring. What did you think? Or are you avoiding them? Do you have reservations about them? 800-989-8255, 800-989-TALK, e-mail is talk@npr. org. Our guest is NPR's Neda Ulaby, who did a story, a series of stories, you may have heard last week about these exhibits on ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. Joining us now is Anita Allen. She's a professor of law and philosophy at the University of Pennsylvania and author of The New Ethics: A Guided Tour of the Twenty-First Century Moral Landscape. She wrote an op-ed in the Philadelphia Inquirer about the Body Worlds exhibit. And she joins us now from the studio at the Wharton Business School of Communications Office on the University of Pennsylvania campus in Philadelphia. Nice of you to be with us today. Professor ANITA ALLEN (University of Pennsylvania): Thanks so much. CONAN: I know you saw the exhibit, and I know you thought it was a freak show. How come? Prof. ALLEN: Well, I didn't exactly think it was a freak show, but I did think that given the popularity, one had to look carefully at some of the ethical issues raised. And I was concerned about a lot of what I saw in Philadelphia. CONAN: I'm sorry. Prof. ALLEN: I was concerned by a lot of what I saw in Philadelphia. CONAN: Like what? Prof. ALLEN: I was concerned about the presence of children in the exhibit. I was concerned about the manner in which some of the female cadavers were posed. I was concerned about the depersonalization of formerly living people, and we can't treat dead people like old furniture. CONAN: Yeah, that's something that a lot of people have concerns about, but yet, as you know, I think in that exhibit, the impresario, if you will, has said that he's checked with everybody. All of these people understood that their bodies were to be used this way. Prof. ALLEN: Yeah, there are two separate informed consent issues. One is whether or not the actual cadavers - adults, children, fetuses - have given or had informed consent given on their behalf. The second question, though, was whether anybody should be permitted to give informed consent to have their bodies plastinated and put on display in a public museum. CONAN: There are also, well, traditions in any number of different, you know, cultures and religions, but a lot of people have objections to bodies being presented this way. Prof. ALLEN: That's right. A lot of people believe that when you die your body should be buried intact or cremated intact, and that if you don't honor the body in that way, there may be repercussions for the afterlife. But even people who don't believe in the afterlife still have concerns about the lack of dignity reflected in putting a hat on a skeleton or splaying open a body like a piece of anchovy and hanging it up on a pole. Those kinds of thinks I think are very offensive to the moral sensitivities of a lot of Americans. CONAN: And I know that you also objected to the atmosphere at the exhibition that you went to, that there was a lot of, well, off-color remarks. Prof. ALLEN: There were a lot of off-color remarks. I think that nervous giggling is one thing, but there were an awful lot of downright sexist and inappropriate comments being made about the displays. But that alone would not cause me to think the display shouldn't happen. I think that rather than say the display is all right or all wrong, we should look very carefully at the respects in which this kind of show does put pressure on, does come into conflict with deeply held moral and ethical beliefs. CONAN: Let me ask you, Neda Ulaby, about that sort of presentation issue. Are there efforts to you know give this a dignified air? Is there music playing? I mean we're talking about dramatic lighting and these dynamic poses that you're talking about. Is there you know sort of a hushed atmosphere? ULABY: I would say it depends on what time of day you go and to which exhibition. Body Worlds is very careful with the museums that sponsor it. It says to stagger entrance, for example, so that not too many people are crowding into an exhibition at a given time. Some museums said people could only stay for a certain amount of time. I saw three of these shows. The first one I went to, I would agree with Professor Allen. This also was in Philadelphia, and it was a mob scene. It was a circus-like atmosphere. I went to another Body Worlds show where it was very somber, very respectful, and one felt like you were surrounded by serious people who were paying attention to a serious topic. So I think it may depend on, you know, if you're there at 2:00 in the afternoon and there are tons of screaming kids and you know noisy teenagers and people out on dates. Then again if, it may be dependent.  It may be a situational kind of a circumstance. CONAN: Let's get another caller into the conversation. This is Jonathan, Jonathan calling us from Newton, Kansas. JONATHAN (Caller): Yes, correct. CONAN: Hi, go ahead. You're on the air. JONATHAN: I view this really - while it shouldn't be outlawed in any way, and I'm not going to say it's worthless, because I do think it has valuable scientific information that's available - this is the modern-day equivalent of a gladiator spectacle. It's right there with public execution, midget throwing and trying to find value in women's mud wrestling. CONAN: I wonder, Anita Allen, would you agree? Prof. ALLEN: Well, I do think that it's in the tradition of circus, in the tradition of spectacle, and that we have to stand back from this and not let the fact that there is some educationally redemptive feature of these shows make us think that we're above P. T. Barnum here. This is a profit-making venture put on by a man with a bizarre moral and aesthetic sense who wants to make money and is making money off of our curiosity and our sense for the weird and the cool. That's what's going on, and we shouldn't let the fact that it's popular somehow blind us to asking the right questions about how should we, a nation that typically buries the dead, respects the dead, respects, for example, the remains of people who were killed in 9/11 or displaced by the Katrina flood, how do we reconcile that level of concern about the dead with our support for these kinds of profit-making spectacles? How do we reconcile those two things? I have a hard time figuring it out. CONAN: Neda, you -JONATHAN: Well, one -CONAN: Go ahead, Jonathan. I'm sorry. JONATHAN: One way to reconcile things is never to outlaw or abandon. But it is (unintelligible) in a very educated and very large majority way regulate things. You used the word respect a lot, and I think it's very valid because people talk both left and right about the slide downhill for respect for life. On people in the right, they say, oh, fight a war, and they're killing people. People on the left say, well, abortion's okay because it's a choice, not a child. This is what you get in a society that doesn't sit as a group and really think through what they're faced with, modern technology because of the absence of leadership. CONAN: Okay. JONATHAN: And I'll hang up and listen. CONAN: Okay, Jonathan, thanks very much. And, Neda, you did talk with Dr. von Hagens, and he says, hey, I'm in the entertainment business. ULABY: He does, and not only that I would point out that the people who are being exhibited are not seeing themselves as exploited if - and here I am making the point, as Dr. von Hagens does, that presumably the people who are on display are the people who come from his very large - thousands of people have said that they want to donate their bodies to him. They say they see this as a kind of a mummification, as a kind of even immortality. Should those people's wishes be respected? Prof. ALLEN: But it's not really immortality. These plastinates have a lifespan. They will eventually deteriorate and have to be disposed of. It's not even close to immortality. CONAN: Let's bring another guest into the conversation. The California Science Center was first to exhibit Body Worlds here in the U. S. Rabbi Morley T. Feinstein is senior rabbi at the University Synagogue and a member of the Ethics Advisory Committee for the California Science Center that helped review the Body World exhibit for the center. He's with us from Los Angeles. Nice to speak with you today. Rabbi MORLEY T. FEINSTEIN (Ethics Advisory Committee for the California Science Center): Good afternoon. Thank you for inviting me to the program. CONAN: What did you think when you first saw the show? Rabbi FEINSTEIN: When I first saw the show, I was absolutely in awe of the physical body that I have that's underneath the skin. The elements that have been raised as objectionable by one of the callers and by our professor, with all due respect to the way they may have viewed the show, we saw this is an absolutely extraordinary opportunity to see what the human body looks like and that somehow underneath the skin we really are all one. CONAN: Were there any ethical considerations that your committee reviewed, any problems at all? Rabbi FEINSTEIN: Oh, absolutely. In fact, one of the critiques that I read about, both from Professor Allen and from Neda in her show last week, is that the Ethics Committee seems to be part of that marketing progress. I have to tell you, when I'm sitting here around the table with a professor of moral theology from a Catholic seminary, from a man who's taught philosophy at the Loyola Marymount University - a Jesuit Catholic institution - with two professors who are ethicists and medical professors at UCLA, as well as others, this is not the kind of committee that would take anything lightly in the ethics vein. In fact it was appropriate for the California Science Center to check with us and to leave it up to us to see whether in fact a contract would be signed regarding the actual exhibition before it was at the California Science Center. CONAN: Neda, I just wanted to check something. I think your report said that the decision to put this exhibition on had been made before the ethics panel review. ULABY: I don't know if I said that in my piece. However, at least one of the people that I spoke to on this ethics board was unaware of controversies that have been raging about the Body Worlds exhibitions in Europe prior to its coming here. And almost everyone I spoke to, including that professor, said that those controversies were not looked at with any kind of deep scrutiny. Prof. ALLEN: I interviewed the directors of the Franklin Institute here in Philadelphia - which sponsored Body World - and was told that for them the decision to put this show on came before they convened their ad hoc ethics committee to consider what ethical issues might be on the table. And that committee simply recommended that they put the pregnant woman behind a black curtain, along with the fetuses, but did not in any way have a role in deciding whether or not the show went on. Rabbi FEINSTEIN: Well, that's not what happened with California. With all due respect to how they handle things in Philadelphia, maybe they needed a model of how to do things right out here the way we did it the first time. We actually engaged an ethicist to deal with some of the issues of informed consent. One of the leading ethicists, Dr. Hans-Martin Sass, senior research scholar at the Kennedy Institute of ethics and a professor of philosophy at the director of the Center for Medical Ethics at Ruhr-University. This gentleman actually was sent by the Science Center to engage with Dr. von Hagens and to check the files and to make sure that the legal requirements for informed consent and clinical research were actually upheld. And, in fact, they were upheld. CONAN: Here's an e-mail we got from Tracy Caine(ph) in San Antonio, Texas. I visited the Body Worlds 3 Exhibition in Houston, Texas, and I was sickened and enthralled at the same time. I walked out and I'm still not sure to this very day how I feel about exhibiting bodies. How could somebody possibly consent to living in perpetuity, playing poker without their skin? Do donors consent to these poses? And I wonder, Rabbi - I know you've heard on this program and you may have had questions about this - people have raised questions about taste in some of these poses. Rabbi FEINSTEIN: Yes. Well, certainly they know. And the consent forms that were on display at the California Science Center also allowed that people actually did sign up to understand that they were going to be in some kind of exhibition and some kind of format for educational purpose. I think it's important to note that these exhibits - and I really can't speak for the other museums - but they're in science centers. They are not held in convention centers or in private halls. They're in public centers for education. I want to really focus on the educational value that's important here. When I went to the exhibit and I saw a seventh grade class with students with notebooks, and I looked as one turned to the other and said, oh my God, that's what a cancerous lung looks like. I'm never putting a cigarette in my mouth. I realized that there were hundreds upon thousands of people who would have the potential to learn about not smoking and about not drinking and the affects it would have because they would see a cirrhotic liver. And for me, the value of public health - of learning, of seeing what the human body is, is such a marvel from our creator and of caring for it - those were absolute paramount issues. CONAN: We're talking about exhibitions of cadavers that are touring the country currently. You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. And let's get another caller on the line. And this is David. David's calling us from Ypsilanti in Michigan. DAVID (CALLER): Yes. Hello. I'm a professor of Corporate Social Responsibility at Eastern Michigan University, and I saw the exhibit when it first started in Germany - in Munich. CONAN: Mm hmm. DAVID: I had some serious concerns at the time regarding informed consent of children and of fetuses. And then I also planned to bring this up in my class -since it's now coming into the United States - as to the fact in making profit on this. It's one thing to - and I want to have the class discussion on the profitability factor of it. My own personal feeling is - I'd be interested to see what the class thought - but I had some serious concerns regard informed consent. Also, you had asked about the freak show aspect of it. Many of the positions -at least in the German exhibit that I saw, I haven't seen it in the States -were freakish. And definitely the comments - like one of the earlier callers had made - were not all about how the lung looks. But they were quite sexual or - and so on and many of the positions were laid out in that way. CONAN: Mm hmm. All right, that was Germany and not Los Angeles. Rabbi Feinstein. . . DAVID: That was Munich. CONAN: Munich, excuse me. Well, part of Germany. The informed consent issue in terms of children and fetuses, did that come up at all? Rabbi FEINSTEIN: Yes, it certainly did. And what it was important for us to note is that the - one of the key areas where people have differed is there's a screen, at least there was at the Science Center in Los Angeles. And the screen, behind which there was a woman who well knew that were she to become pregnant there was a possibility of her dying and death. And she had made her informed consent decision regarding herself and the fetus, which was inside her as the property of her mother. And so what in this case - I have to tell you, having just had the miracle of my wife giving birth to twins, we looked at that fetus inside the mother and the first reaction was: and you had two of them inside you? But it was indeed for us a feeling of absolute incredulity at what a wonder it was that some are able to live in this world and, unfortunately, some die. Prof. ALLEN: It is unfortunate. And that particular display was in Philadelphia placed behind a special black curtain. And I had very strongly negative responses to that. Why is it that the human reproductive function has to be treated as something special? If we're going to have an open and free discussion and viewing of the human body, why do we treat the female pregnant body as different? And when it comes to children, we're not just talking about the fetuses and the embryos. There are actual little children who appear to be between three and six years old on display in an exhibit called The Family that's part of Body Worlds. We have to also address the question of their informed consent and who has the right to give consent on behalf of these children. Not fetuses, but children. DAVID: I agree. And being in Munich, it was also behind the curtain. But the point that the last speaker just made is exactly that. Who has the right to give that informed consent? And if that right is also a profit-making endeavor, it brings in another issue. CONAN: Rabbi, we'll let you have the last word. Rabbi FEINSTEIN: In this particular case, our ethics committee worked with the Science Center. The Science Center consulted with the UCLA child psychologists, as well as its own early childhood education staff to develop a parent and child guide to assist parents in deciding whether they want to bring their child to the exhibit or not and how to handle that particular visit. I saw children at the exhibit. Their parents were pointing out the vein system or they were pointing out. . . CONAN: I don't think the question was about children visiting the exhibit. It was about the children in the exhibit whose bodies were on display. DAVID: Exactly. Rabbi FEINSTEIN: Right. And the, you know, one thing that we knew regarding the informed consent was that in this particular area there was a sense of - for us - of having anonymity between the donor and the exhibit. And the issue of whether it's a fetus or a child really would have been, obviously, the decision of the parent in both cases to make such a decision. CONAN: Rabbi, thank you. Prof. ALLEN: We hope. We hope. CONAN: We'll have to leave it there. Rabbi, thanks very much for your time today. Rabbi FEINSTEIN: My privilege. And thank you for educating the public. Prof. ALLEN: Thank you so much. CONAN: Rabbi Morley T. Feinstein. And our thanks also to Anita Allen - who you just heard - a professor of law and philosophy at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. Our thanks also to NPR's Neda Ulaby, who was with us here in Studio 3A. You can go to our Web site, npr. org, and listen to her reports that were featured last week on ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. When we come back, we'll go to Mexico City and talk about the still disputed presidential election. This is TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.  NEAL CONAN, host:  This is TALK OF THE NATION. I'm Neal Conan, in Washington.  For the past two years, an exhibit called Body Worlds has been touring the United States and attracting a lot of visitors. It features beautifully preserved, skinless cadavers, theatrically lit and dramatically posed, riding a horse maybe or playing chess.  It's success spawned competition, including a show called Bodies: The Exhibit. Presenters say the displays educate visitors about anatomy and the wonders of the human body and that their popularity is a boon for under-funded science museums.  But some wonder who these people were and where they came from. Did they agree to have their bodies used like this? Are public displays of cadavers education, entertainment or freak shows? Like it or not, producers say 20 million people around the world have now visited these exhibits over the past 10 years and that business is booming.  Later in the program, we'll go to Mexico City, where protests continue following the disputed presidential election there, and to Lebanon for an update on efforts to get humanitarian supplies to the southern part of the country.  But first, cadavers and controversy. If you visited one of these shows, what did you think? Did you have reservations? Our number here in Washington is 800-989-8255. That's 800-989-TALK. The e-mail address is talk@npr. org.  Neda Ulaby is cultural reporter for NPR. She did a series of stories on the exhibit you may have heard on ALL THINGS CONSIDERED last week. And she joins us now in Studio 3A. Thanks very much for being on the show.  NEDA ULABY reporting:  Thank you, Neal.  CONAN: When you visited these exhibitions, what did you think?  ULABY: They're extraordinary. I don't think it would be - I think it would be near impossible to go to one of these exhibits to not be profoundly moved. And one of the things that really startled me when I went to them, and I went to three of them. I saw Bodies: The Exhibition in New York City, and I saw Body Worlds in Philadelphia and Body Worlds 2 in Denver. And there were so many people of so many ages who had such an incredible range of responses to these exhibitions.  I spoke to scientists who were marveling over the incredible skill with which these dissections were done. And I talked to people who identified themselves as very deeply religious people from a number of faiths who felt that this reaffirmed their feeling that, for example, that evolution was a myth and that only God could have created something as beautiful as a human being in the sort of perfect form.  CONAN: You mentioned Body Worlds. This has spawned - I mean, not only, it's spawned competition, it's spawned spin-offs. They have various iterations of this show traveling in different parts of the country.  ULABY: Two major exhibition distributors in the United States and then a third that's just started to get a foothold. Worldwide, there are perhaps eight or 10. It's a little hard to tell because a lot of these body exhibition companies abroad are, frankly, quite shady.  CONAN: There's also a big distinction between the two in this country, one of which are the Body Worlds. They say they know where all these bodies came from and that these people all gave permission, that this has been ethically cleared. And the other exhibition says, no, these are bodies that were unclaimed. We got them from China, and that's where we got them.  ULABY: That's correct. Gunther von Hagens's Body Worlds, which had its first exhibition in Japan in 1996, says that all of the bodies, all of the whole bodies, he exhibits in North America come from European and American donors.  He says that he never has ever used bodies that came to him in any kind of unethical way. He also plastinates bodies for sale in medical schools. Those do not necessarily come from donated bodies. Bodies: The Exhibition only uses bodies from China, unclaimed bodies, in their North American exhibitions.  CONAN: Yet even this Gunther von Hagens, he does not - these are all anonymous. He doesn't put any specific piece of paperwork with a specific body, cadaver. And as you say, these have been - well, tell us a little bit about the process by which they're preserved.  ULABY: The process is called plastination. It's a process that was invented by Dr. Gunther von Hagens, and it's a really extraordinary process. The way it works is all of the fluid is removed from a corpse, not necessarily a human corpse, by the way. When you go to some of these shows, you'll see animals preserved. And seeing them in their glory is also quite magnificent.  So what this process does is all of the fluid is taken out of a body and replaced with polymer. It's such an incredibly delicate process that, for example, all of the veins in a body can be filled with this plastinate and everything else can be stripped away so all that you see is a cloudlike form of veins, some of which are so tiny it's like filigree. It's beautiful.  CONAN: Well. Let's get some listeners involved in the conversation. 800-989-8255 if you'd like to join us, 800-989-TALK. Our e-mail address is talk@nprnews. And let's get - we'll begin with Ebony. Ebony's calling us from Cleveland.  EBONY (Caller): Hi.  CONAN: Hi, you're on the air. Go ahead, please.  EBONY: Yeah, I just wanted to comment that I went to the exhibit here in Cleveland. I think we have Body Worlds 2. I thought it was awesome, one of the best things I've ever seen in my life, except for some of the positions he had females in. I thought it was a little risqu\u00e9, and maybe I'm being biased because I am a female, but you could really read a lot into some of the positions. But the overall work I thought was totally awesome, and I recommend anyone to go see it, which it was kind of hard trying to find someone to even go with me. But I thought it was awesome.  CONAN: Hard to find somebody to go with you because people felt a little skittish about it.  EBONY: Yeah or exactly, right. They're like, oh no, you know, you're sick and all that kind of stuff. And I'm thinking, you know, we can learn a lot from this, which I learned quite a lot.  CONAN: So you don't feel like a ghoul at all.  EBONY: No, not at all.  CONAN: And, on the other hand, if - I understand that they put out requests for people to donate their bodies after they die, would you consider donating yours?  EBONY: I've always considered it. I think that's the best way to learn. I think more people should do it. I am a spiritual person. I do believe that we will go on, but my body can be used for anyone to learn whatever they need to learn from it. I think that would awesome.  CONAN: All right, Ebony. Thanks very much for the call. Appreciate it.  EBONY: Thank you.  CONAN: Does she reflect a number of the people that you talked with, Neda?  ULABY: Absolutely. And one thing that I've heard from many people is when you first walk into in particular the Body Worlds exhibition, which are famous for the flair and the drama with which they're presented, the farther and farther you go into these exhibitions, the more baroque and, some would say, over the top the poses are. It's not at all uncommon to see a body turned, more or less, into a chest of drawers. The name of that body in particular is actually the Drawer Man. Some would find these whimsical and cute how either the body is pulled out in these sort of drawer-like ways or exploded in other ways. Others might find them gratuitous.  Dr. von Hagens himself says that each one of these poses, even the ones that Ebony finds a little tasteless, he says that each one of these poses is intended to illustrate a particular anatomical principle.  CONAN: And he signs them, as if they are works of art.  ULABY: That is a fairly new development for him, and that comes in the wake of copyright disputes that he's had over competing exhibitions and the way they've arranged and plastinated their bodies.  CONAN: Let's get another caller on the line, Kim. Kim also calling from Cleveland.  KIM (Caller): Yes, I'm a nursing student, and I went to see it in Cleveland. And I went with my professor, actually, and we spent hours with our books open and laying on the floor and identifying all the different body parts and veins, and it was just fascinating.  CONAN: So you took this as an anatomy lesson.  KIM: It was an anatomy lesson. But I actually, that was the second time I saw it. I was able to attend the opening in Cleveland with my husband for my anniversary present. And so I actually got to see all the bodies as I had heavy hors d'oeuvres and a glass of wine, so it was actually very interesting.  CONAN: I suspect you won't forget it.  KIM: No, definitely not. There was something interesting. The same person that did this exhibit, Dr. von whatever his last name is.  CONAN: Hagens, yeah.  KIM: I was in London a couple of months ago and watching TV, my husband and I, and he actually has a live autopsy show where he does an autopsy with a live audience and kind of goes through whatever ailment this person had or what they died from and then has a human model that he can point out on them where he's going to start cutting. It was - my husband said it was kind of like a train wreck. He couldn't stop watching.  CONAN: Mm-hmm.  ULABY: Be it may, I ask the caller if you had any discussions in your class with your professor about the ethics of such exhibitions and about the sort of collision of entertainment and education.  KIM: The only thing that we - the way we handled it is it was not considered a fieldtrip. We met our professor there, and we made our choice to go individually. You didn't have to attend. Because there were some people that really didn't think that it was a correct thing to do.  CONAN: There are medical schools in Cleveland where people - medical students -do autopsies as a matter of course, as part of their instruction. Kim, you could have presumably just gone, taken the class to go see one of those.  KIM: True, you probably could have, but I don't know. It was just, as people were saying, in the different positions that they put these people in, it's just so amazing to see the muscles actually work. It's almost like a lesson in movement because they change every time someone changes their position.  CONAN: And I guess, Neda, I'm old enough to remember those plastic models that you bought, you were given as kids. The Visible Man and the Visible Woman. Certain parts were omitted, but anyway, I'm sure there are rather more complicated versions - I've seen them in museums. That's a difference between you know plastic, real plastic, and plasticized cadavers.  KIM: Right. You can really see all of the different things that can happen. And he also has a huge section on what happens if you smoke and what happens if you drink. And so you really got to see what a black lung looked like, and it was much more I think moving than seeing a picture of it.  ULABY: Now when I interviewed Dr. von Hagens in Denver at the show there, one of the things he told me was that he chose to exhibit the bodies in this very kind of dynamic way because he had tried showing them in Japan in the first exhibition laid out in similar ways as you might see in an anatomical lab, and he said that it freaked people out, that they looked spooky. They looked like ghosts. They looked, in short, like corpses. And some critics would say that perhaps by exhibiting these bodies in these tremendously dynamic poses to a certain extent it takes - it adds an element of unreality to it, that you're - CONAN: Abstracted.  ULABY: - but from the death and from the fact that these were actual human beings.  CONAN: Did you think of them as real human beings, Kim?  KIM: You know I have to admit in a way I thought of them more as works of art because of the way they were set out, and the only thing that - I chose to go but my husband didn't - behind a curtain you could go to see, they actually had fetuses inside someone's body at different stages of development. And my husband knew he couldn't handle that, and I knew that I could. So there were things that you actually got to decide can I go that step further?  CONAN: Kim, thanks very much for joining us. Appreciate the phone call.  KIM: Thank you, bye-bye.  CONAN: There are, as she mentioned, exhibits of fetuses and fetuses in human body, also of children, which raise questions about consent and other ethical issues. We're going to be talking about those with two ethicists when we come back from a break.  If you'd like to join the conversation, again, our number is 800-989-8255, 800-989-TALK. Our e-mail address is talk@npr. org. I'm Neal Conan. It's the TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.  (Soundbite of music)  This is TALK OF THE NATION. I'm Neal Conan, in Washington. We're talking today about the popularity of body exhibits and taking your calls. If you've been to one of these exhibits, give us a ring. What did you think? Or are you avoiding them? Do you have reservations about them? 800-989-8255, 800-989-TALK, e-mail is talk@npr. org.  Our guest is NPR's Neda Ulaby, who did a story, a series of stories, you may have heard last week about these exhibits on ALL THINGS CONSIDERED.  Joining us now is Anita Allen. She's a professor of law and philosophy at the University of Pennsylvania and author of The New Ethics: A Guided Tour of the Twenty-First Century Moral Landscape. She wrote an op-ed in the Philadelphia Inquirer about the Body Worlds exhibit. And she joins us now from the studio at the Wharton Business School of Communications Office on the University of Pennsylvania campus in Philadelphia. Nice of you to be with us today.  Professor ANITA ALLEN (University of Pennsylvania): Thanks so much.  CONAN: I know you saw the exhibit, and I know you thought it was a freak show. How come?  Prof. ALLEN: Well, I didn't exactly think it was a freak show, but I did think that given the popularity, one had to look carefully at some of the ethical issues raised. And I was concerned about a lot of what I saw in Philadelphia.  CONAN: I'm sorry.  Prof. ALLEN: I was concerned by a lot of what I saw in Philadelphia.  CONAN: Like what?  Prof. ALLEN: I was concerned about the presence of children in the exhibit. I was concerned about the manner in which some of the female cadavers were posed. I was concerned about the depersonalization of formerly living people, and we can't treat dead people like old furniture.  CONAN: Yeah, that's something that a lot of people have concerns about, but yet, as you know, I think in that exhibit, the impresario, if you will, has said that he's checked with everybody. All of these people understood that their bodies were to be used this way.  Prof. ALLEN: Yeah, there are two separate informed consent issues. One is whether or not the actual cadavers - adults, children, fetuses - have given or had informed consent given on their behalf. The second question, though, was whether anybody should be permitted to give informed consent to have their bodies plastinated and put on display in a public museum.  CONAN: There are also, well, traditions in any number of different, you know, cultures and religions, but a lot of people have objections to bodies being presented this way.  Prof. ALLEN: That's right. A lot of people believe that when you die your body should be buried intact or cremated intact, and that if you don't honor the body in that way, there may be repercussions for the afterlife. But even people who don't believe in the afterlife still have concerns about the lack of dignity reflected in putting a hat on a skeleton or splaying open a body like a piece of anchovy and hanging it up on a pole. Those kinds of thinks I think are very offensive to the moral sensitivities of a lot of Americans.  CONAN: And I know that you also objected to the atmosphere at the exhibition that you went to, that there was a lot of, well, off-color remarks.  Prof. ALLEN: There were a lot of off-color remarks. I think that nervous giggling is one thing, but there were an awful lot of downright sexist and inappropriate comments being made about the displays. But that alone would not cause me to think the display shouldn't happen. I think that rather than say the display is all right or all wrong, we should look very carefully at the respects in which this kind of show does put pressure on, does come into conflict with deeply held moral and ethical beliefs.  CONAN: Let me ask you, Neda Ulaby, about that sort of presentation issue. Are there efforts to you know give this a dignified air? Is there music playing? I mean we're talking about dramatic lighting and these dynamic poses that you're talking about. Is there you know sort of a hushed atmosphere?  ULABY: I would say it depends on what time of day you go and to which exhibition. Body Worlds is very careful with the museums that sponsor it. It says to stagger entrance, for example, so that not too many people are crowding into an exhibition at a given time. Some museums said people could only stay for a certain amount of time.  I saw three of these shows. The first one I went to, I would agree with Professor Allen. This also was in Philadelphia, and it was a mob scene. It was a circus-like atmosphere. I went to another Body Worlds show where it was very somber, very respectful, and one felt like you were surrounded by serious people who were paying attention to a serious topic.  So I think it may depend on, you know, if you're there at 2:00 in the afternoon and there are tons of screaming kids and you know noisy teenagers and people out on dates. Then again if, it may be dependent.  It may be a situational kind of a circumstance.  CONAN: Let's get another caller into the conversation. This is Jonathan, Jonathan calling us from Newton, Kansas.  JONATHAN (Caller): Yes, correct.  CONAN: Hi, go ahead. You're on the air.  JONATHAN: I view this really - while it shouldn't be outlawed in any way, and I'm not going to say it's worthless, because I do think it has valuable scientific information that's available - this is the modern-day equivalent of a gladiator spectacle. It's right there with public execution, midget throwing and trying to find value in women's mud wrestling.  CONAN: I wonder, Anita Allen, would you agree?  Prof. ALLEN: Well, I do think that it's in the tradition of circus, in the tradition of spectacle, and that we have to stand back from this and not let the fact that there is some educationally redemptive feature of these shows make us think that we're above P. T. Barnum here. This is a profit-making venture put on by a man with a bizarre moral and aesthetic sense who wants to make money and is making money off of our curiosity and our sense for the weird and the cool.  That's what's going on, and we shouldn't let the fact that it's popular somehow blind us to asking the right questions about how should we, a nation that typically buries the dead, respects the dead, respects, for example, the remains of people who were killed in 9/11 or displaced by the Katrina flood, how do we reconcile that level of concern about the dead with our support for these kinds of profit-making spectacles? How do we reconcile those two things?  I have a hard time figuring it out.  CONAN: Neda, you - JONATHAN: Well, one - CONAN: Go ahead, Jonathan. I'm sorry.  JONATHAN: One way to reconcile things is never to outlaw or abandon. But it is (unintelligible) in a very educated and very large majority way regulate things. You used the word respect a lot, and I think it's very valid because people talk both left and right about the slide downhill for respect for life.  On people in the right, they say, oh, fight a war, and they're killing people. People on the left say, well, abortion's okay because it's a choice, not a child. This is what you get in a society that doesn't sit as a group and really think through what they're faced with, modern technology because of the absence of leadership.  CONAN: Okay.  JONATHAN: And I'll hang up and listen.  CONAN: Okay, Jonathan, thanks very much. And, Neda, you did talk with Dr. von Hagens, and he says, hey, I'm in the entertainment business.  ULABY: He does, and not only that I would point out that the people who are being exhibited are not seeing themselves as exploited if - and here I am making the point, as Dr. von Hagens does, that presumably the people who are on display are the people who come from his very large - thousands of people have said that they want to donate their bodies to him. They say they see this as a kind of a mummification, as a kind of even immortality. Should those people's wishes be respected?  Prof. ALLEN: But it's not really immortality. These plastinates have a lifespan. They will eventually deteriorate and have to be disposed of. It's not even close to immortality.  CONAN: Let's bring another guest into the conversation. The California Science Center was first to exhibit Body Worlds here in the U. S. Rabbi Morley T. Feinstein is senior rabbi at the University Synagogue and a member of the Ethics Advisory Committee for the California Science Center that helped review the Body World exhibit for the center. He's with us from Los Angeles. Nice to speak with you today.  Rabbi MORLEY T. FEINSTEIN (Ethics Advisory Committee for the California Science Center): Good afternoon. Thank you for inviting me to the program.  CONAN: What did you think when you first saw the show?  Rabbi FEINSTEIN: When I first saw the show, I was absolutely in awe of the physical body that I have that's underneath the skin. The elements that have been raised as objectionable by one of the callers and by our professor, with all due respect to the way they may have viewed the show, we saw this is an absolutely extraordinary opportunity to see what the human body looks like and that somehow underneath the skin we really are all one.  CONAN: Were there any ethical considerations that your committee reviewed, any problems at all?  Rabbi FEINSTEIN: Oh, absolutely. In fact, one of the critiques that I read about, both from Professor Allen and from Neda in her show last week, is that the Ethics Committee seems to be part of that marketing progress.  I have to tell you, when I'm sitting here around the table with a professor of moral theology from a Catholic seminary, from a man who's taught philosophy at the Loyola Marymount University - a Jesuit Catholic institution - with two professors who are ethicists and medical professors at UCLA, as well as others, this is not the kind of committee that would take anything lightly in the ethics vein.  In fact it was appropriate for the California Science Center to check with us and to leave it up to us to see whether in fact a contract would be signed regarding the actual exhibition before it was at the California Science Center.  CONAN: Neda, I just wanted to check something. I think your report said that the decision to put this exhibition on had been made before the ethics panel review.  ULABY: I don't know if I said that in my piece. However, at least one of the people that I spoke to on this ethics board was unaware of controversies that have been raging about the Body Worlds exhibitions in Europe prior to its coming here. And almost everyone I spoke to, including that professor, said that those controversies were not looked at with any kind of deep scrutiny.  Prof. ALLEN: I interviewed the directors of the Franklin Institute here in Philadelphia - which sponsored Body World - and was told that for them the decision to put this show on came before they convened their ad hoc ethics committee to consider what ethical issues might be on the table. And that committee simply recommended that they put the pregnant woman behind a black curtain, along with the fetuses, but did not in any way have a role in deciding whether or not the show went on.  Rabbi FEINSTEIN: Well, that's not what happened with California. With all due respect to how they handle things in Philadelphia, maybe they needed a model of how to do things right out here the way we did it the first time.  We actually engaged an ethicist to deal with some of the issues of informed consent. One of the leading ethicists, Dr. Hans-Martin Sass, senior research scholar at the Kennedy Institute of ethics and a professor of philosophy at the director of the Center for Medical Ethics at Ruhr-University.  This gentleman actually was sent by the Science Center to engage with Dr. von Hagens and to check the files and to make sure that the legal requirements for informed consent and clinical research were actually upheld. And, in fact, they were upheld.  CONAN: Here's an e-mail we got from Tracy Caine(ph) in San Antonio, Texas.  I visited the Body Worlds 3 Exhibition in Houston, Texas, and I was sickened and enthralled at the same time. I walked out and I'm still not sure to this very day how I feel about exhibiting bodies. How could somebody possibly consent to living in perpetuity, playing poker without their skin? Do donors consent to these poses?  And I wonder, Rabbi - I know you've heard on this program and you may have had questions about this - people have raised questions about taste in some of these poses.  Rabbi FEINSTEIN: Yes. Well, certainly they know. And the consent forms that were on display at the California Science Center also allowed that people actually did sign up to understand that they were going to be in some kind of exhibition and some kind of format for educational purpose.  I think it's important to note that these exhibits - and I really can't speak for the other museums - but they're in science centers. They are not held in convention centers or in private halls. They're in public centers for education. I want to really focus on the educational value that's important here.  When I went to the exhibit and I saw a seventh grade class with students with notebooks, and I looked as one turned to the other and said, oh my God, that's what a cancerous lung looks like. I'm never putting a cigarette in my mouth.  I realized that there were hundreds upon thousands of people who would have the potential to learn about not smoking and about not drinking and the affects it would have because they would see a cirrhotic liver.  And for me, the value of public health - of learning, of seeing what the human body is, is such a marvel from our creator and of caring for it - those were absolute paramount issues.  CONAN: We're talking about exhibitions of cadavers that are touring the country currently. You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.  And let's get another caller on the line. And this is David. David's calling us from Ypsilanti in Michigan.  DAVID (CALLER): Yes. Hello. I'm a professor of Corporate Social Responsibility at Eastern Michigan University, and I saw the exhibit when it first started in Germany - in Munich.  CONAN: Mm hmm.  DAVID: I had some serious concerns at the time regarding informed consent of children and of fetuses. And then I also planned to bring this up in my class -since it's now coming into the United States - as to the fact in making profit on this. It's one thing to - and I want to have the class discussion on the profitability factor of it. My own personal feeling is - I'd be interested to see what the class thought - but I had some serious concerns regard informed consent.  Also, you had asked about the freak show aspect of it. Many of the positions -at least in the German exhibit that I saw, I haven't seen it in the States -were freakish. And definitely the comments - like one of the earlier callers had made - were not all about how the lung looks. But they were quite sexual or - and so on and many of the positions were laid out in that way.  CONAN: Mm hmm. All right, that was Germany and not Los Angeles. Rabbi Feinstein. . .  DAVID: That was Munich.  CONAN: Munich, excuse me. Well, part of Germany. The informed consent issue in terms of children and fetuses, did that come up at all?  Rabbi FEINSTEIN: Yes, it certainly did. And what it was important for us to note is that the - one of the key areas where people have differed is there's a screen, at least there was at the Science Center in Los Angeles. And the screen, behind which there was a woman who well knew that were she to become pregnant there was a possibility of her dying and death. And she had made her informed consent decision regarding herself and the fetus, which was inside her as the property of her mother.  And so what in this case - I have to tell you, having just had the miracle of my wife giving birth to twins, we looked at that fetus inside the mother and the first reaction was: and you had two of them inside you? But it was indeed for us a feeling of absolute incredulity at what a wonder it was that some are able to live in this world and, unfortunately, some die.  Prof. ALLEN: It is unfortunate. And that particular display was in Philadelphia placed behind a special black curtain. And I had very strongly negative responses to that. Why is it that the human reproductive function has to be treated as something special? If we're going to have an open and free discussion and viewing of the human body, why do we treat the female pregnant body as different?  And when it comes to children, we're not just talking about the fetuses and the embryos. There are actual little children who appear to be between three and six years old on display in an exhibit called The Family that's part of Body Worlds. We have to also address the question of their informed consent and who has the right to give consent on behalf of these children. Not fetuses, but children.  DAVID: I agree. And being in Munich, it was also behind the curtain. But the point that the last speaker just made is exactly that. Who has the right to give that informed consent? And if that right is also a profit-making endeavor, it brings in another issue.  CONAN: Rabbi, we'll let you have the last word.  Rabbi FEINSTEIN: In this particular case, our ethics committee worked with the Science Center. The Science Center consulted with the UCLA child psychologists, as well as its own early childhood education staff to develop a parent and child guide to assist parents in deciding whether they want to bring their child to the exhibit or not and how to handle that particular visit.  I saw children at the exhibit. Their parents were pointing out the vein system or they were pointing out. . .  CONAN: I don't think the question was about children visiting the exhibit. It was about the children in the exhibit whose bodies were on display.  DAVID: Exactly.  Rabbi FEINSTEIN: Right. And the, you know, one thing that we knew regarding the informed consent was that in this particular area there was a sense of - for us - of having anonymity between the donor and the exhibit. And the issue of whether it's a fetus or a child really would have been, obviously, the decision of the parent in both cases to make such a decision.  CONAN: Rabbi, thank you.  Prof. ALLEN: We hope. We hope.  CONAN: We'll have to leave it there. Rabbi, thanks very much for your time today.  Rabbi FEINSTEIN: My privilege. And thank you for educating the public.  Prof. ALLEN: Thank you so much.  CONAN: Rabbi Morley T. Feinstein. And our thanks also to Anita Allen - who you just heard - a professor of law and philosophy at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. Our thanks also to NPR's Neda Ulaby, who was with us here in Studio 3A. You can go to our Web site, npr. org, and listen to her reports that were featured last week on ALL THINGS CONSIDERED.

I'm Melissa Block. It doesn't take a scientist to know that humans are different from chimpanzees. It does take a scientist to figure out way. Now an international scientific team reports in the journal Nature it's found something that may be an important piece of the explanation. NPR's Joe Palca has the story. JOE PALCA reporting: There are three billion DNA letters or base pairs, as scientists call them, in the human genome. Only a small fraction of these letters are genes that make proteins. For decades scientists looking for genetic differences between humans and chimps have been focusing on protein coding genes because proteins do the work inside cells. Ms. SOPHIE SOLOMA(ph) (University of California Santa Cruz): We felt that by limiting ourselves to looking at protein coding regions we would be casting our net too narrowly. PALCA: Sophie Soloma is a research biologist at the University of California Santa Cruz. Soloma says to broaden the search, she and her colleagues asked a simple question. If you line up the DNA from several different species, are there regions that are similar between chickens, rats, mice and chimpanzee, but very different in humans. The team found 35,000 candidates but Soloma says one stood out. Ms. SOLOMA: It's a region of the genome of 118 base pairs. It happens to lie on chromosome 20, and there are 18 differences between the human and chimpanzee sequence. PALCA: For comparison there are only two differences between chimpanzees and chickens in the same region. It sound became clear this region didn't code for a protein. Instead it coded for something that told other genes what to do. What else did you know about this region at the time? Ms. SOLOMA: Well, to start, not much. That's the challenge. PALCA: There were clues that it might, might have something to do with genes in the brain and maybe, just maybe this little section of DNA might explain why human brains are so much larger than chimp brains. The next step was to find someone who could see what this DNA was doing in the developing brain. So she sweet talked a colleague in Belgium into taking on the project. Ms. SOLOMA: I said, you know, if you're interested in new critical development genes, I have a candidate for you. PALCA: He said he'd look into it, and Soloma gave him some biological probes that would allow him to see if her DNA snippet was doing anything as the fetal brain was developing. Ms. SOLOMA: And I didn't hear anything for a long time and I just sort of thought, well, that was that. Either it didn't work or he didn't want to do the experiment. But about I think it was three or four months later, I got this email saying, Dear Sophie. Remember those probes you gave me. PALCA:  Something very interesting was going on, he wrote. The probes showed Soloma's DNA seemed to be active at the very time the brain was developing. Possibly orchestrating other genes so they'd make a big, human-sized brain. For geneticist Mary Claire King, Soloma's result is extremely gratifying. King is now at the University of Washington, but in the early \u201870s she was a graduate student at the University of California Berkley campus. Ms. MARY CLAIRE KING (Geneticist): My PhD dissertation was a demonstration that humans and chimpanzees differ by only one percent in the sequence of genes that code for protein. PALCA: So Kind suspected something else had to be going on to account for the obvious differences between them, something that didn't code for proteins but perhaps controlled other genes, exactly what Soloma seems to have found 30 years later. But there's bound to be more to the story of why chimps and humans went their separate ways. Tom Curran is a researcher at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, where he studies how genes affect the brain. Mr. TOM CURRAN (Children's Hospital of Philadelphia): As always in biology your ideas at the beginning are fairly na\u00efve, and once you do a few experimental tests, you'll find those ideas. And sometimes you go off in a completely different direction. PALCA: With luck, human scientists' big brains will eventually point the way to the right direction. Joe Palca NPR News Washington.

I'm Madeleine Brand. ALEX CHADWICK, host: And I'm Alex Chadwick. Studying evolution, scientists look for fossils from millions of years ago. That's the sort of bio timescale I associate with Darwin. But along the coast of New England and Atlantic states researchers have found an evolutionary speedster that has changed its ways in less than 20 years, the humble bivalve, the mussel. With an insight to just what life and death pressures can mean, here is New Hampshire Public Radio's Kerry Grens. (Soundbite of waves) KERRY GRENS reporting: On a clear August day, small waves lap the coastline at Odiorne State Park in Rye, New Hampshire. This tranquil scene belies the ecological and evolutionary bustle going on below the surface. University of New Hampshire Professor Jeb Byers dips his hand into the water and pulls up an example. Professor JEB BYERS (University of New Hampshire): Oh, one of our culprits just washed up, the Asian shore crab. GRENS: It's a small, red and tan striped crab shell from a molting juvenile. The shell is only the size of a thumbnail. Mr. BYERS: Yeah, he is little and that's one of the surprising things. It doesn't seem like he'd be so menacing, but they have quite an appetite for small juvenile mussels. GRENS: The Asian shore crab was first reported on the Atlantic coast in New Jersey in 1988. In the two decades since, the crabs have migrated north to Penobscot Bay in Maine and south to North Carolina. Byers and his student, Aaren Freeman, found that as the crabs have worked their way up and down the coast the mussels have evolved a way to fend them off - and they've done it in the blink of an evolutionary eye. Freeman says that when mussels sense crabs nearby they will thicken their shells. Mr. AAREN FREEMAN (Student, University of New Hampshire): And that then benefits the mussel by making them less susceptible to predation from the crab. The crab usually accesses its prey by crushing the shell. GRENS: The thickening process takes a few months and it's a drain on the mussel, costing it energy that could go toward reproduction. To save energy, the thickening process is like a switch. When crabs are around, mussels flip the switch on. If the mussels don't sense crabs, they leave the switch off. Scientists have long known that mussels could thicken their shells in response to other varieties of crabs, but what they didn't know was that the mussels could rapidly evolve the same response to a new crab predator. Freeman argues that it's taken the blue mussel just 15 years. He found that only mussels from Long Island Sound will flip the thickening switch when the crabs are present. Their ancestors have lived among Asian shore crabs since the 1980s. But mussels from northern Maine - where the Asian shore crabs have not yet arrived - don't thicken their shell when they're placed in the same environment as the crabs. Mr. FREEMAN: I knew that they would have the capacity to recognize a crab and they would have this capacity to respond. And the fact that they didn't respond to the Asian shore crab, it's pretty good information that they don't recognize that as a predator. GRENS: Freeman says the best explanation is rapid evolution. Although rapid evolution has happened in other animals, this is the first time scientists have seen it result in a major physical change an animal can turn on and off. Jeb Byers says shell fishermen could use the adaptation to their advantage by selectively breeding animals that can thwart Asian shore crabs. But mussel harvesters say their more concerned about starfish than crabs. Byers says mussels have also evolved a defense against starfish. Now he wants to know whether the mussels can fend off both predators at once. His study appears in the current issue of Science Magazine. For NPR News, this is Kerry Grens.

That's the sort of bio timescale I associate with Darwin. But along the coast of New England and Atlantic states researchers have found an evolutionary speedster that has changed its ways in less than 20 years, the humble bivalve, the mussel.  With an insight to just what life and death pressures can mean, here is New Hampshire Public Radio's Kerry Grens.

When soldiers came home from Vietnam, psychiatrists, the military and the Veterans Administration didn't recognize the existence of mental illness caused by exposure to combat trauma. It was the veterans themselves who fought for the creation of the diagnosis we now know as PTSD. Once PTSD was officially recognized, there was more controversy and often bitter debate over just how many vets were affected. NPR's Joseph Shapiro reports on the new research. JOSEPH SHAPIRO reporting: Post-traumatic stress disorder is a psychiatric condition that can result from experiencing a terrifying danger. PTSD can cause anxiety, flashbacks and extreme wariness that sometimes gets in the way of a person's ability to hold a job or to get along with others. It was 20 years ago when researchers first tried to come up with a number for how many Vietnam vets had PTSD. Dr. BRUCE DOHRENWEND: (New York State Psychiatric Institute) And there have been only two nation-wide studies of PTSD and Vietnam veterans, and these two studies came up with very, very different rates of PTSD. SHAPIRO: That's Bruce Dohrenwend. He's a psychologist and epidemiologist at the New York State Psychiatric Institute. He led the work on the new study, the third nation-wide study. He said it was needed because those earlier reports came up with numbers that were so far apart. One said 15 percent of veterans had dealt with PTSD. The other found rates twice as high - 31 percent, or nearly a third of all returning veterans. That second study was ordered by Congress. It's known as the National Vietnam Veterans Readjustment Study, and like many things with the Vietnam War, it was surrounded by controversy. Richard McNally is a professor of psychology at Harvard. He's argued that 31 percent just seemed too high. Professor RICHARD McNALLY: (Harvard University) Some of the issues and criticisms that had been raised mainly by historians of military psychiatry who had pointed out how do you get 30 percent PTSD rates when only about 15 percent of the men who served in Vietnam were actually assigned to combat units? SHAPIRO: That gave rise to the notion of the phony combat vet, that some soldiers were simply lying about fighting in combat. The authors of one book argued that of Vietnam veterans getting benefits for PTSD, 75 percent were fakers. So Bruce Dohrenwend, the researcher in New York, went and found what he called a gold mine of data, actual combat records that allowed him to verify the claims of a sample of 260 veterans in the original study. If they said they were in a firefight or saw someone die, he'd check if it really happened. Dohrenwend's study is being published in the journal Science. Dr. DOHRENWEND: And our general conclusion is that by and large, the veterans were telling us the truth. We can find very little evidence of falsification. SHAPIRO: Less than a half percent. Dr. Matthew Friedman runs the National Center for PTSD for the Department of Veterans Affairs. Dr. MATTHEW FRIEDMAN (Department of Veterans Affairs): This is terribly important in terms of some of the debates that are going on right now about, you know, how reliable are these things, and so it's a landmark study and it's very, very important. SHAPIRO: The VA's own inspector general has noted that the number of veterans getting PTSD benefits is up 80 percent in recent years. The VA has asked independent researchers to look at the issue. Matthew Friedman of the VA. Dr. FRIEDMAN: The Institute of Medicine, at the request of the VA, is looking into the whole issue of PTSD, the diagnostic validity, the assessment process. The data that Bruce Dohrenwend has collected are extremely valuable in giving people confidence. They are a very strong rebuttal to some of the critics of the PTSD diagnostic assessment process in general. SHAPIRO: There's still that other question. So how many Vietnam veterans did develop PTSD, 15 percent or 31 percent? Researcher Bruce Dohrenwend. Dr. DOHRENWEND: Our numbers were 18. 7 percent, lifetime, close to 20 percent. SHAPIRO: Dohrenwend says that's a lot, but it's not 30 percent. That earlier study counted all kinds of PTSD, even if it was caused by some event, like being in a serious car accident, that happened before or after the veteran was in Vietnam. And the definition of PTSD has changed over time. The new study counts only those whose PTSD was so severe that they had trouble carrying on their everyday lives. Joseph Shapiro, NPR News.

I'm Melissa Block. A federal judge ruled today that major cigarette makers engaged in a 50-year conspiracy to deceive the public about the dangers of smoking. Judge Gladys Kessler imposed new restrictions on the industry, including that they stop marketing cigarettes as light or low tar. NPR's Libby Lewis joins us to talk about the case. And Libby, tell us what Judge Kessler had to say about this conspiracy. LIBBY LEWIS reporting: Well, she took 1700 pages to say that the tobacco industry has engaged in a conspiracy for decades to defraud or deceive the public about the dangers of smoking. She had some pretty strong language. She said over the course of more than 50 years, she wrote, defendants lied, misrepresented and deceived the American public, including young people, about the devastating health effects of smoking. She wrote, they suppress research, they destroyed documents, they destroyed the truth and they abused the legal system. She went into great detail about the history and the manner and means in which she believes they did that. BLOCK: What penalties did Judge Kessler impose on the tobacco industry in this ruling today? LEWIS: Well, that's what's so interesting. There all of this passionate language, and not so much of a bite. Judge Kessler, when you boil it all down, she did not assess any financial penalties on the industry at all. She gave only part of the wish list of the government and the anti-tobacco community for what they felt the industry owed the public for their behavior over the past 50 years. She did order the industry to stop using the terms light or low tar. Those terms are meant to suggest that the products that use them are safer, and the evidence, she says, is clear that they're not and that they are used to deceive smokers. So she ordered them to stop using that language. But she did not order the companies to fund money for stop smoking programs or the education programs like the ones we've heard about from the American Legacy Foundation that work to persuade young people not to take up smoking. BLOCK: And those programs were what the government had wanted the judge to impose. LEWIS: They're actually, some of them were programs the government wanted them to impose, but some of them were programs the anti-tobacco community came in and told the judge, the public needs these as well. BLOCK: Libby, this case has been kicking around in the courts for a number of years now. Remind us how the case came about and how the litigation has evolved over the years. LEWIS: Yeah, it's a very interesting history. This case was filed in 1999. This was an era when the states were suing the tobacco companies, and the tobacco industry reached a settlement with many of the states in 1998, which was a multibillion dollar settlement. And the federal government filed its lawsuit soon thereafter using the federal racketeering statue, which was designed to go after organized crime. BLOCK: Has there been reaction to Judge Kessler's ruling today, either from the government or from the tobacco companies or from anti-smoking groups? LEWIS: Yes, a statement from R. J. Reynolds says that the company is deeply gratified that the judge chose not to impose any financial penalties. The Department of Justice says that it's happy for Judge Kessler's ruling that the industry violated the racketeering statue, but it's disappointed that she did not order the companies to pay for education programs and stop smoking programs. Some of the anti-tobacco groups say they're also deeply disappointed. They're trying to find the silver lining and say that Judge Kessler's ruling provides a good foundation for individuals who wanna go into court and sue the companies. BLOCK: NPR's Libby Lewis.

I am Ira Flatow, and for the rest of the hour, the string theory rebellion. If you've listened to this program, you've heard us talk a lot about string theory and how it among other theories has risen to the top as one of the most talked about solutions to a central problem in physicists, and that is how to unit all the forces and particles in the universe, especially quantum mechanics and relativity, gravity. Countless books, papers, articles, TV shows have sought to explain it to us, but what we have not heard so much about are the critics of the theory, who are now openly questioning its usefulness in physicists. They say that string theory is not living up to its promise, that it offers no testable hypotheses and that's it's more hype than science. Two new books are out that question string theory. One of the authors is here with us, Lee Smolin, as well as one of the most visible, I'd say certainly the most visible string theory scientist, Brian Greene. And if you'd like to talk with them, our number is 1-800-989-8255, 1-800-989-TALK. As I say, Brian Greene is professor of physics and mathematics at Columbia here in New York. He's also the author of several books, including The Elegant Universe and The Fabric of the Cosmos. He joins us by phone. Welcome back to SCIENCE FRIDAY, Dr. Greene. Dr. BRIAN GREENE (Columbia University): Thank you. FLATOW: Thank you. You're welcome. Lee Smolin is a faculty member at the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in Ontario. He's also the author of The Trouble with Physics: The Rise of String Theory, the Fall of a Science and What Comes Next. He joins us from the studios of CBC in Canada. Thank you for talking with us today, Dr. Smolin. Mr. LEE SMOLIN (Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics): Thank you. FLATOW: You're welcome. Tell us why you wrote this book. Mr. SMOLIN: Ira, I wrote this book in order to try to understand why string theory, which is a theory I myself have worked on, although not exclusively, why it was problematic. I was trying to understand why the ideas which seemed at first so beautiful, so natural, were not getting us where we expected to get 20 years ago. I had another motive as well, which is more general. I was very interested in and am very interested in the idea that there's a close connection between science when it thrives, when it's doing well, and a democratic society when it's doing well. And I wanted to use the case of the theory that was not leading up to expectations as a kind of study to try to see how robust science is - and indeed science is robust - and to try to understand better this intuition that is a close connection between science and democratic societies. FLATOW: Let's talk about your first issue. You're saying that the string theory has not lived up to expectations. Is that correct? Mr. SMOLIN: That's the feeling of many people, certainly not just myself, and you know, when you in the introduction talked about rebellion or talked about new voices, there have always been people who were skeptical of string theory. Indeed there have been experts in the field who have been far more skeptical than I've been all along. I'm somebody who has been sometimes working on string theory, sometimes working on alternative theories. And one of the stories that I wanted to tell that I think deserves to be told is that string theory, with the beautiful things about it and with its faults, is one of a spectrum of approaches to the deep problems of unification, of putting together quantum mechanics and gravity, and it's always been part of a spectrum of approaches. And that, situating it within that is a story that I wanted to tell and that I think has not maybe been told well enough. FLATOW: Brian Greene, do you agree that string theory has not lived up to its expectations? Dr. GREENE: Well, you always want to be further along than you are, because it'd be great to have the answers that we've been searching for. But the thing about science is you can't predict the rate of progress, and the best you really can hope for realistically is that you make progress toward the goals that you set for yourselves. And I have to tell you, where we are today in string theory is beyond what I had hoped 20 years ago. Certainly we've yet to achieve many goals that I still hold dear, that many people in the field hold dear - namely to make predictions, that we can really go out and test and determine whether this theory is right or wrong. So certainly at this moment, skepticism is a healthy attitude towards string theory. But in terms of progress and in terms of being satisfied that the theory is making headway, absolutely, absolutely. FLATOW: Tell us a bit about what string theory, the problems that string theory, Brian, are supposed to unite or to solve. Dr. GREENE: Well, we have two main pillars of understanding in physics that were developed in the 20th century. One is the general theory of relativity, Einstein's theory that describes gravity. And gravity is a force that's relevant mostly when things are big - stars and galaxies and so forth. The other major development is quantum mechanics, and it's a theory that describes the other end of the spectrum, the small things - the molecules and the atoms and so forth. Now for a long time, we've recognized that these two theories have to talk to each other in a sensible way. There are realms, extreme realms, where things that are both heavy and small, like black holes in the center or like the beginning of the universe. And because those realms exists, you need to use both gravity, general relativity, and quantum mechanics at the same time. The problem is for many decades any attempt to put the two theories together, to unify them, if you will, didn't work. It gave wrong, nonsensical answers. String theory is an attempt to fix that, to give us a theory that won't give nonsensical answers, that will give answers that make sense when you put gravity and quantum mechanics together. FLATOW: Now Lee Smolin, you write that string theory makes no new predictions that are testable by current or even currently conceivable experiments. Is that your main issue with the theory? Mr. SMOLIN: It's one of them, and I think that's not controversial, and I often agree with Brian, but I have to disagree with him about the expectations. Certainly I expected 20 years, and I think many people talked as if they expected, that we would see predictions rather soon. And in - connected with this book, I was curious and I did a study of past revolutions in science and past attempts to make unifications of physics. And what I found looking at the history, which disturbed me very much - both about string theory, and I should say also for some other directions that I've worked on - is that history seems to show that when there's a good idea about unifying different parts of physics, it works fast if it's going to work. It takes some bold risks and the risk pays off. And within five or 10 years, there's experiments, even if those experiments are in domains that nobody would have thought of to look for before. And so I think it is problematic that string theory is not making experimental predictions. There are certainly very beautiful things about it. On the other hand, if you look at some of the alternatives that have been explored, some of the alternative ideas, they're not - they're also, as is not string theory, fully developed theories, but they're ideas, and they do lead to experimental predictions. And those predictions are being tested. So I think that this is the old standard on which science is judged, scientific progress is judged, which is to have a good idea you should be able to test it. And if it's the right idea, then the experiments turn out to support the idea and support the predictions of the idea. And I think we should stick to this standard. FLATOW: Why not just let the string theorists continue doing what they're doing, and if they turn out to be wrong, they're wrong. Well, why not let time be the judge of what's happening? Mr. SMOLIN: Oh, certainly time will be the judge, and I - it would never be it for me to say to somebody what you might be doing, what you should be doing. If somebody feels that string theory or anything else is the most promising thing they know about, certainly they should work on it. But there is another level, and that's the level where we think about science as a very risky activity. And if it is a very risky activity, something like development of a new technology, the question arises - do we support only one direction? Do we put all of our apples or whatever it is in one basket? Or do we hedge our bets? Do we support all the people who are excited about the good ideas that they have? And this is a large part of the issue that I'm raising in this book. It's not a question of what one individual scientist does. One individual scientist should do what they deeply believe in. But it is a question, when we step back from that and look at the range of science and look at it as a kind of community, as a collective endeavor, we can take attitudes where we encourage people to strike out on their own, to leave behind old ideas, even if there's still things about them we love, and to encourage the young people, especially the young people, to forget what people of our older generations have done and strike out for new directions. Or we can encourage attitudes in which we try to keep everybody working along the directions that we feel comfortable with. And that's a large part of the issue. FLATOW: So do you think that young scientists, graduate students, are going down a dead end if they get into string theory research now? Is that basically what you're saying, that we're not letting, giving oxygen to the other theories or that they aren't being encouraged? Dr. SMOLIN: Let me turn it around because I would never tell a scientist what not to do. But what I do know and what I care very much about is that there are very good young scientists who are not working on string theory, who are not working, I should say, on the direction that I've invested a lot in, which is loop quantum gravity, who have their own ideas and their own directions and those people who are, in a way, kind of orphans. But the analogs of the great physicists of the past who always struck out on their own, people like Galileo and Einstein, those people don't have an easy time because of the way that the university - universities are very adverse to risks. They're very adverse to hiring people who are working on their own ideas as opposed to ideas that large communities of people have been working on for decades. And so my point is that we should try to find ways to help and support those people who have new ideas and have the courage to work on their own ideas. FLATOW: Brian, how much time do you think that physicists need to see some of the predictions or to let string theory play itself out, so to speak? Dr. GREENE: Well, there's no crystal ball, so it's really hard to predict, as I was saying before. But I would want to emphasize a couple of highly relevant points, which is no string theorist would ever want to change the standard of proof for a theory being its confirmation by experimental observation. That's why I say repeatedly until I'm blue in the face when I'm out there lecturing, in my books and so forth, that you should not believe string theory is right because we don't believe it's right. It may be right and only experiment will tell. How long will it take for those experiments to happen? I don't know. We could get lucky. It could be that the Large Hadron Collider, which will turn on in 2007 or 2008, there's a chance that we might see some of the fingerprints of string theories through something called super symmetry, certain particles that the theories suggest should be there but nobody has yet seen, through the possibility of seeing the extra dimensions of space that this theory requires by virtue of certain missing energy signatures in the data. The possibility that we might confirm string theory through astronomical observations is something that I work on. That's what I spend my time on these days, trying to see where these strings might leave some imprint in the microwave background radiation, the heat left over from the big bang. All of these are long shots. But we're doing exactly what Lee is saying one should do in science, namely work toward experimental verification. How long? I can't predict. Nobody can predict. But let me just also, on this other issue of encouraging young students to strike out on their own and pursue their own ideas, I couldn't agree more. Absolutely. I, for instance, in the last couple of years have had students that don't work on string theory. I've had students that have worked on relatively fringe ideas according to the mainstream point of view, something called modified Newtonian dynamics. I've had students working on that. I've had students working on more bread-and-butter particle physics. So absolutely we need to encourage diversity of thought. We need to encourage the young students to express their creativity. Who would ever say otherwise? FLATOW: Talking about string theory this hour on TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. I'm Ira Flatow talking with Brian Greene, professor of physics and mathematics at Columbia, author of The Elegant Universe: The Fabric of the Cosmos, Lee Smolin, faculty member at the Perimeter Institute of Theoretical Physics in Ontario, Canada, author of the new book, The Trouble with Physics: The Rise of String Theory, The Fall of a Science and What Comes Next. 1-800-989-8255 is our number. Let's go to the phones about what comes next. Hi, Jeffrey, in North Hampton, Massachusetts. Hi. JEFFREY (Caller): Hi. I just had a question. If string theory doesn't pan out as Mr. Smolin's saying, what do you propose like the legions of string theory should do - like what direction should they strike out in? Is there any like -something to like stand behind string theory? Because it seems like it's been dominating the field for a while. And just like in general what would be the future if it doesn't pan out? FLATOW: What else is there on the horizon, Lee? Dr. SMOLIN: There are about half a dozen other active approaches. The names won't mean much to most listeners. But if you like I'll just throw them out. One of them is deformed special relativity. Another is dynamical triangulations -FLATOW: Well, just give us a little sentence with each one what that might mean. Deformed special -Dr. SMOLIN: Deformed special relativity is an idea that quantum gravity affects, alter the basic equations of special relativity. It turns out in ways that are testable by experiments that are going on now or are going to be launched next year. Dynamical triangulations is one of several ideas on the basis of which space is made of discreet elements. And one tries to find effects that come from the fact that, the hypothesis that space is discreet. Loop quantum gravity, which is a direction that I've been privileged to work on sometimes, is something that is a successful unification, at least at the level of the equations, of general relativity and quantum theory. And it has led to a very particular picture of space being made out of discreet elements. And there are consequences of that which people are exploring. FLATOW: One of the - let me just stop you there and talk about your own work a little bit on loop quantum gravity, because one of its implications is, if I'm correct, I understand it correctly, is that there might be a time before the big bang. The big bang was not the beginning of time? Would that be correct? Dr. SMOLIN: Well -FLATOW: Or is that too hard for you to explain? Dr. SMOLIN: No, no, no. It's an old idea, not an idea just to weigh-in of quantum gravity. It's an old idea that quantum mechanical effects remove that first instance of time that we call the initial singularity, where the density of matter, the temperature, everything is infinite, and allow time to proceed to the past so that there was a past. The calculations that we have done so far using loop quantum gravity strongly suggests - I would not say mathematically prove - but strongly suggests that the theory predicts that that is the case. And it's one of several different ideas on which that expectation holds. FLATOW: We're going to take a short break and come back and talk lots more with our guests, Lee Smolin, author of The Trouble with Physics, Brian Greene, you know him very well, author of The Elegant Universe, talking about the string theory and other possible competing theories. Our number, 1-800-989-8255. Stay with us. We'll be right back after this short break. I'm Ira Flatow and this is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow. We're talking this hour about string theory with my guests, Brian Greene, author of The Elegant Universe. He is professor of math and physics at Columbia University. Lee Smolin, faculty member at the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in Ontario, Canada, author of The Trouble with Physics. Our number, 1-800-989-8255. Brian, you've invested so much time in string theory. Would this be terribly disappointing if you just keep waiting and nothing happens? Dr. GREENE: Well, it would be disappointing if we're unable to determine whether theory is right or wrong and we just keep on developing it and we're unable to make contact with experiment. And were that to really happen over the course of the next, I don't know how many years or whether one should measure it in decades. Certainly I would imagine interest in the theory would drop off because the people who work on string theory are physicists and physicists want to make contact with physical reality. But what's happened over the course of the last 20 years of development is that the theory has gone through what we call revolutions in our thinking time and time again, which has given a surge of energy, a surge of interest in the theory, which has kept us going even though we've yet to make that desired contact with experiment. If I just say quickly how we maintain that enthusiasm, I'd say there are really two main reasons. One, the theory is able to embrace all of the major developments in physics having to do with the elementary particles in quantum mechanics that were discovered before string theory in the middle of the 20th Century leading up to the end of the 20th Century. They all naturally find a home within string theory. And that's very compelling to us because usually a revolution doesn't actually erase the past. It embraces the past but goes further. And that's what string theory seems to be doing. The other side of it is even without the experimental confirmation, string theory has a very intricate mathematical structure that holds together with a kind of tight logical cohesion. There are checks and rechecks in the calculations, enormous number of consistency checks, and they're all passed. The theory comes through with flying colors every step of the way. And that again keeps us going, keeps us thinking that this theory is at least heading in the right direction. FLATOW: Well, Lee, what would be wrong with that if things are working like that? Dr. SMOLIN: You know, it's a delightful situation, because everything that Brian says is true. And because of that I'm, and many other people have spent time on the theory. There are things that, however, it doesn't come close to doing, apart from - I think we've talked enough about experiment and I'm very glad we agree about that. If you really put quantum mechanics together with a description of space, then we know from general considerations that the notion of space should disappear just like the notion of the trajectory of a particle disappears in quantum mechanics into a more general notion of a quantum state, and then we have the idea that a particle is either a wave of a particle, depending on what questions we ask about it. The same thing should happen to space in the geometry of space. Now, string theory may address that question. But so far it doesn't very directly whereas other approaches do address that very (unintelligible) - give us a new language to describe space in a way that's consistent completely with the idea that the classical description that we're used to, the idea we're living in this three-dimensional, fixed geometry, goes away. And so I think the right way, the way that I like to think about it, is that different approaches have different strengths. We've learned something from the different approaches, including string theory, including the other approaches. But each of them, including string theory, has run into barriers, things that it doesn't easily do. And because of that, I'm convinced - see, I see it something like mountain climbing. I see doing physics as something like a group of people trying to find the summit of a mountain, but in a fog. And many of us, maybe most of us, who are well trained, know how to climb. You put us down on a hill. We go up hill and we find the summit that's nearest to us, that's uphill from here. The problem with that is that the real summit is somewhere off in the fog somewhere. And so my sense of the field is that what we are as a field is where people who have discovered the tops of a number of hills and string theory is a very beautiful high hill. And loop quantum gravity's another one. And dynamical triangulations is another one. And causal sets is another one. And twisted theory is another one. And meanwhile, the summit, maybe these are way stations on the way to the summit. But to get to the real summit we need to cross some perilous ridges or go through some swamps down in the valley and really find it. And that's why above all what I'm encouraging is that we put the things that kind of work, that work beautifully but run into limitations behind us and we encourage ourselves as working physicists and the younger people to break loose and risk climbing over those perilous ridges in the fog and find the summit. FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255 is our number. Talking with Brian Greene and Lee Smolin. Let's go to Brenda in Minneapolis. Hi, Brenda. BRENDA (Caller): Hello. FLATOW: Hi there. BRENDA: My suggestion is that they need to get a bigger box, that -FLATOW: A sandbox? BRENDA: You know, that maybe it's not - maybe they don't need another big super collider. You know? Maybe there's some kind of systematic distortion in how the culture of the people researching string theory are thinking that is distorting their ideas about it or making them all - they need somebody to really think outside of the box and then to think outside of that box, if you understand what I mean. Dr. SMOLIN: May I address that? FLATOW: Sure. BRENDA: Yes. Dr. SMOLIN: Yes, I know exactly what you mean. And I agree with one strong proviso. And the but is that to be a good scientist you have to be a rebel the way you're suggesting. You have to be willing to think outside the box as you're suggesting. But you also have to be a conservative. You have to master the tradition of all the knowledge and all the techniques that came before you, because as Brian said, I agree strongly, revolutions don't wipe out the past. They build on the past knowledge. And to be a good scientist requires - and the great scientists have this, somehow this contradiction internally within each person as well as within the community of scientists, in which we are both very, very deeply conservative and very rebellious. And that's the trick to doing science. BRENDA: Well, maybe another way to think about it is it's like a decision tree, the branches. Maybe the tree you're on isn't a tree. Maybe it's just a branch. You need to go back further in the decision tree to find out where you made the mistake of thinking you were at the root when it was just another branch. Dr. SMOLIN: The only thing I disagree - I agree with you. And the person who can do that and at the same time has mastered the past knowledge so when they find a branch that goes somewhere - your branches are like my hills. So when the person finds the branch that goes somewhere they have the training and the ability to climb it. That's the only thing that I would insist on. But otherwise I agree with you. And Brian was saying, and I agree, when we make choices about which students, which younger people we encourage, we support, I look for those who are capable of going back in the decision tree, who wonder maybe quantum mechanics really doesn't make any sense. Maybe the problem is there. And the evidence for that is that some of the greatest physicists alive do worry about those very foundational questions. For example, Roger Penrose or Girard Etoft(ph), they -FLATOW: Do - I'm sorry. Go ahead. Dr. SMOLIN: Go ahead. No, go ahead. FLATOW: No, I was just wondering, I'm just following up on her thoughts. I mean, are we at a point now where you just have to sit and scratch your head and think we need some revolution. We may even need a revolution in physics. Maybe we need a new physics. Dr. SMOLIN: Well, I think we do need a new physics. I think we need experiment and experiment is coming from several directions, from the Large Hadron Collider in Geneva, which comes online next year, from the glass experiment, which is a satellite that will launch next year that will be able to test very, very precisely whether the speed of light is really constant or whether that principle of Einstein's needs modification, from the observations of the cosmic microwave background, which I know Brian works on and I wonder about and people from all points of view in quantum gravity are trying to make predictions about as the experiments improve. So we need and we are getting new experiments. And nothing can happen without experiment. And I also think we need a revolution or we need - the way that I would put it is we need to complete a revolution. Einstein started this. Einstein started the revolution in the early 1900s when he - and he was the first person to declare that we needed a quantum theory to break with the physics that went before. And he also brought us relativity theory. And that was the launch of the revolution. And we're still engaged in that same revolution. It won't be over until this problem of putting together relativity and quantum theory is solved, and not just solved in principle on a pad of paper, but solved in such a way that it leads to new experiments and new predictions for experiments. FLATOW: Brian, any comment? Dr. GREENE: Yes. Well, I full well believe that we will, when we do complete this revolution that Lee's referring to, have a completely different view of the universe. I totally agree with Lee that everything that we know points to space and time not even being fundamental entities. The way I like to think about it is take the concept of temperature. We all know what it means for something to be hot or to be cold. We can experience it. But scientists taught us that there's an underlying physics to temperature which has to do with how fast particles, molecules, are moving. Molecules move fast, it appears hot. It feels hot. Molecules move slowly, it will feel cold. So the idea of temperature rests on a foundation of more fundamental ideas, motion of molecules. We think that space and time are like temperature in a sense that they rely upon more fundamental ideas as well. Now what those more fundamental entities are, the so-called atoms, if you will, that make up space and time, we don't know yet. String theory has some vague suggestions. Loop quantum gravity has some vague suggestions. We're not there yet. But when we get there, I think we will learn that space and time are not what we thought they are. They are going to morph into something completely unfamiliar. And we'll find that in certain circumstances space and time appear the way we humans interpret those concepts, but fundamentally the universe is not built out of these familiar notions of space and time that we experience. FLATOW: Talking about string theory this hour on TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR news. Talking with Brian Greene, author of The Elegant Universe, Lee Smolin, author of The Trouble with Physics. So much in the way that we used to think that gravity only happened here on earth, we expanded it out to, you know, to think of it having, being in other places besides the earth and also being able to measure it. That would be true of space and time? There's this underlying structure to - and is that the right word, structure to it that could change the speed of space, the speed of time, things like that? Dr. GREENE: It would change the very notion of reality if you really want to be more precise because we all, I believe, most of us, at least, think about reality as existing in a region of space and taking place through some duration of time. If we learned that those basic ideas, the arena of space and the duration of time, are not concepts that even apply in certain realms, the realm of, say, the very extreme of energy or the very extremes of small size and tiny intervals. If the notions of space and time evaporate, then our whole conception of reality, the whole container of reality, will have evaporated and we'll have to learn to think about physics in the universe completely differently. FLATOW: So that our reality would just be one special case of all of reality. Dr. GREENE: Precisely. FLATOW: Lee? Sounds pretty Twilight Zone. Dr. SMOLIN: It's not, it's not as far out as it sounds. Really, Ira, it's not. And seeing space is made up of something, atoms, of something more fundamental, you can go a long way with an image that the air looks smooth, the water looks smooth, and we discover that really it's made out of atoms. But then there are two questions. One question, which Brian addressed, is how do you go from this microscopic description, from the atoms to the smooth properties that we observe? And that's an aspect of it. Another aspect, which Einstein, part of his genius was to jump directly to, is are there consequences for experiment of the fact that, in his case, matter's made of atoms? And that's why I keep pushing about experiment so much, because indeed it does seem that if space is made of atoms, there are consequences for how light propagates. And these consequences are checkable by experiments that use observations of light coming from very, very far away to look for very small differences in how light of different colors or different energies propagate. Now I want to emphasize that we don't have a prediction that makes an absolutely precise prediction for what these experiments should see. And that's a source of great frustration to all of us. But we have some general ideas about what the effect should be to look for and if those effects are seen, and this could be in as little as a year and a half, two years, from this experiment that I was talking about that looks at gamma rays coming from very, very far away. Then that will indicate that what Brian is saying is absolutely right. That will be the discovery of the atoms of space in the same way that some of Einstein's discoveries really cemented the idea that matter is made of atoms. FLATOW: Brian, how do you, as a physicist with things moving so slowly, how do you stop from being impatient? Dr. GREENE: Well, they're not actually moving that slowly. It may seem slow from the outside because, you know, I've been on your program in the past few years and I don't remember but you probably asked me, are there experimental tests of string theory? And I had to say as yet there aren't. We're working toward it, which is more or less what I'm saying today. But in terms of the actual field itself, our understanding of the underlying theory, our understanding of the equations, our understanding of the fundamental ideas and how they relate to one another, we've made great strides. I mean, we have an international meeting every year, a string theory conference that has something like 50 talks. And these talks are generally amazing. They're generally showing how people are making great progress in spite of not having the guide of experiment. So if it turns out, as Lee is saying, that some of the experiments he's describing or the experiments of the Large Hadron Collider, if in the next couple of years these experiments bear fruit and begin to show us some of the features of the theories that we've been working on for a long time, things will definitely take a major leap forward. So it's a very exciting time, waiting to see the results of those experiments. And in no way would one want to say that the theory is moving slowly. It perhaps is moving slowly toward these experiments, which are coming online. But the theory itself is developing rapidly. In fact, it's hard to keep up. FLATOW: All right. We've run out of time. Thank you. Brian Greene, author of The Elegant Universe, professor of math and physics at Columbia University. Lee Smolin, author of The Trouble with Physics, faculty member at the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in Ontario, Canada. Thank you, gentlemen, for taking time to be with us today. Dr. GREENE: Thank you. Dr. SMOLIN: Thank you very much. FLATOW: Have a good weekend.  IRA FLATOW, host:  You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I am Ira Flatow, and for the rest of the hour, the string theory rebellion.  If you've listened to this program, you've heard us talk a lot about string theory and how it among other theories has risen to the top as one of the most talked about solutions to a central problem in physicists, and that is how to unit all the forces and particles in the universe, especially quantum mechanics and relativity, gravity.  Countless books, papers, articles, TV shows have sought to explain it to us, but what we have not heard so much about are the critics of the theory, who are now openly questioning its usefulness in physicists. They say that string theory is not living up to its promise, that it offers no testable hypotheses and that's it's more hype than science.  Two new books are out that question string theory. One of the authors is here with us, Lee Smolin, as well as one of the most visible, I'd say certainly the most visible string theory scientist, Brian Greene. And if you'd like to talk with them, our number is 1-800-989-8255, 1-800-989-TALK.  As I say, Brian Greene is professor of physics and mathematics at Columbia here in New York. He's also the author of several books, including The Elegant Universe and The Fabric of the Cosmos. He joins us by phone. Welcome back to SCIENCE FRIDAY, Dr. Greene.  Dr. BRIAN GREENE (Columbia University): Thank you.  FLATOW: Thank you. You're welcome. Lee Smolin is a faculty member at the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in Ontario. He's also the author of The Trouble with Physics: The Rise of String Theory, the Fall of a Science and What Comes Next. He joins us from the studios of CBC in Canada. Thank you for talking with us today, Dr. Smolin.  Mr. LEE SMOLIN (Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics): Thank you.  FLATOW: You're welcome. Tell us why you wrote this book.  Mr. SMOLIN: Ira, I wrote this book in order to try to understand why string theory, which is a theory I myself have worked on, although not exclusively, why it was problematic. I was trying to understand why the ideas which seemed at first so beautiful, so natural, were not getting us where we expected to get 20 years ago.  I had another motive as well, which is more general. I was very interested in and am very interested in the idea that there's a close connection between science when it thrives, when it's doing well, and a democratic society when it's doing well. And I wanted to use the case of the theory that was not leading up to expectations as a kind of study to try to see how robust science is - and indeed science is robust - and to try to understand better this intuition that is a close connection between science and democratic societies.  FLATOW: Let's talk about your first issue. You're saying that the string theory has not lived up to expectations. Is that correct?  Mr. SMOLIN: That's the feeling of many people, certainly not just myself, and you know, when you in the introduction talked about rebellion or talked about new voices, there have always been people who were skeptical of string theory. Indeed there have been experts in the field who have been far more skeptical than I've been all along. I'm somebody who has been sometimes working on string theory, sometimes working on alternative theories.  And one of the stories that I wanted to tell that I think deserves to be told is that string theory, with the beautiful things about it and with its faults, is one of a spectrum of approaches to the deep problems of unification, of putting together quantum mechanics and gravity, and it's always been part of a spectrum of approaches. And that, situating it within that is a story that I wanted to tell and that I think has not maybe been told well enough.  FLATOW: Brian Greene, do you agree that string theory has not lived up to its expectations?  Dr. GREENE: Well, you always want to be further along than you are, because it'd be great to have the answers that we've been searching for. But the thing about science is you can't predict the rate of progress, and the best you really can hope for realistically is that you make progress toward the goals that you set for yourselves. And I have to tell you, where we are today in string theory is beyond what I had hoped 20 years ago.  Certainly we've yet to achieve many goals that I still hold dear, that many people in the field hold dear - namely to make predictions, that we can really go out and test and determine whether this theory is right or wrong. So certainly at this moment, skepticism is a healthy attitude towards string theory. But in terms of progress and in terms of being satisfied that the theory is making headway, absolutely, absolutely.  FLATOW: Tell us a bit about what string theory, the problems that string theory, Brian, are supposed to unite or to solve.  Dr. GREENE: Well, we have two main pillars of understanding in physics that were developed in the 20th century. One is the general theory of relativity, Einstein's theory that describes gravity. And gravity is a force that's relevant mostly when things are big - stars and galaxies and so forth.  The other major development is quantum mechanics, and it's a theory that describes the other end of the spectrum, the small things - the molecules and the atoms and so forth.  Now for a long time, we've recognized that these two theories have to talk to each other in a sensible way. There are realms, extreme realms, where things that are both heavy and small, like black holes in the center or like the beginning of the universe. And because those realms exists, you need to use both gravity, general relativity, and quantum mechanics at the same time.  The problem is for many decades any attempt to put the two theories together, to unify them, if you will, didn't work. It gave wrong, nonsensical answers. String theory is an attempt to fix that, to give us a theory that won't give nonsensical answers, that will give answers that make sense when you put gravity and quantum mechanics together.  FLATOW: Now Lee Smolin, you write that string theory makes no new predictions that are testable by current or even currently conceivable experiments. Is that your main issue with the theory?  Mr. SMOLIN: It's one of them, and I think that's not controversial, and I often agree with Brian, but I have to disagree with him about the expectations. Certainly I expected 20 years, and I think many people talked as if they expected, that we would see predictions rather soon.  And in - connected with this book, I was curious and I did a study of past revolutions in science and past attempts to make unifications of physics. And what I found looking at the history, which disturbed me very much - both about string theory, and I should say also for some other directions that I've worked on - is that history seems to show that when there's a good idea about unifying different parts of physics, it works fast if it's going to work. It takes some bold risks and the risk pays off. And within five or 10 years, there's experiments, even if those experiments are in domains that nobody would have thought of to look for before.  And so I think it is problematic that string theory is not making experimental predictions. There are certainly very beautiful things about it. On the other hand, if you look at some of the alternatives that have been explored, some of the alternative ideas, they're not - they're also, as is not string theory, fully developed theories, but they're ideas, and they do lead to experimental predictions. And those predictions are being tested.  So I think that this is the old standard on which science is judged, scientific progress is judged, which is to have a good idea you should be able to test it. And if it's the right idea, then the experiments turn out to support the idea and support the predictions of the idea. And I think we should stick to this standard.  FLATOW: Why not just let the string theorists continue doing what they're doing, and if they turn out to be wrong, they're wrong. Well, why not let time be the judge of what's happening?  Mr. SMOLIN: Oh, certainly time will be the judge, and I - it would never be it for me to say to somebody what you might be doing, what you should be doing. If somebody feels that string theory or anything else is the most promising thing they know about, certainly they should work on it.  But there is another level, and that's the level where we think about science as a very risky activity. And if it is a very risky activity, something like development of a new technology, the question arises - do we support only one direction? Do we put all of our apples or whatever it is in one basket? Or do we hedge our bets? Do we support all the people who are excited about the good ideas that they have?  And this is a large part of the issue that I'm raising in this book. It's not a question of what one individual scientist does. One individual scientist should do what they deeply believe in. But it is a question, when we step back from that and look at the range of science and look at it as a kind of community, as a collective endeavor, we can take attitudes where we encourage people to strike out on their own, to leave behind old ideas, even if there's still things about them we love, and to encourage the young people, especially the young people, to forget what people of our older generations have done and strike out for new directions.  Or we can encourage attitudes in which we try to keep everybody working along the directions that we feel comfortable with. And that's a large part of the issue.  FLATOW: So do you think that young scientists, graduate students, are going down a dead end if they get into string theory research now? Is that basically what you're saying, that we're not letting, giving oxygen to the other theories or that they aren't being encouraged?  Dr. SMOLIN: Let me turn it around because I would never tell a scientist what not to do. But what I do know and what I care very much about is that there are very good young scientists who are not working on string theory, who are not working, I should say, on the direction that I've invested a lot in, which is loop quantum gravity, who have their own ideas and their own directions and those people who are, in a way, kind of orphans.  But the analogs of the great physicists of the past who always struck out on their own, people like Galileo and Einstein, those people don't have an easy time because of the way that the university - universities are very adverse to risks. They're very adverse to hiring people who are working on their own ideas as opposed to ideas that large communities of people have been working on for decades.  And so my point is that we should try to find ways to help and support those people who have new ideas and have the courage to work on their own ideas.  FLATOW: Brian, how much time do you think that physicists need to see some of the predictions or to let string theory play itself out, so to speak?  Dr. GREENE: Well, there's no crystal ball, so it's really hard to predict, as I was saying before. But I would want to emphasize a couple of highly relevant points, which is no string theorist would ever want to change the standard of proof for a theory being its confirmation by experimental observation.  That's why I say repeatedly until I'm blue in the face when I'm out there lecturing, in my books and so forth, that you should not believe string theory is right because we don't believe it's right. It may be right and only experiment will tell.  How long will it take for those experiments to happen? I don't know. We could get lucky. It could be that the Large Hadron Collider, which will turn on in 2007 or 2008, there's a chance that we might see some of the fingerprints of string theories through something called super symmetry, certain particles that the theories suggest should be there but nobody has yet seen, through the possibility of seeing the extra dimensions of space that this theory requires by virtue of certain missing energy signatures in the data.  The possibility that we might confirm string theory through astronomical observations is something that I work on. That's what I spend my time on these days, trying to see where these strings might leave some imprint in the microwave background radiation, the heat left over from the big bang.  All of these are long shots. But we're doing exactly what Lee is saying one should do in science, namely work toward experimental verification. How long? I can't predict. Nobody can predict.  But let me just also, on this other issue of encouraging young students to strike out on their own and pursue their own ideas, I couldn't agree more. Absolutely.  I, for instance, in the last couple of years have had students that don't work on string theory. I've had students that have worked on relatively fringe ideas according to the mainstream point of view, something called modified Newtonian dynamics. I've had students working on that. I've had students working on more bread-and-butter particle physics.  So absolutely we need to encourage diversity of thought. We need to encourage the young students to express their creativity. Who would ever say otherwise?  FLATOW: Talking about string theory this hour on TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. I'm Ira Flatow talking with Brian Greene, professor of physics and mathematics at Columbia, author of The Elegant Universe: The Fabric of the Cosmos, Lee Smolin, faculty member at the Perimeter Institute of Theoretical Physics in Ontario, Canada, author of the new book, The Trouble with Physics: The Rise of String Theory, The Fall of a Science and What Comes Next.  1-800-989-8255 is our number. Let's go to the phones about what comes next. Hi, Jeffrey, in North Hampton, Massachusetts. Hi.  JEFFREY (Caller): Hi. I just had a question. If string theory doesn't pan out as Mr. Smolin's saying, what do you propose like the legions of string theory should do - like what direction should they strike out in? Is there any like -something to like stand behind string theory? Because it seems like it's been dominating the field for a while. And just like in general what would be the future if it doesn't pan out?  FLATOW: What else is there on the horizon, Lee?  Dr. SMOLIN: There are about half a dozen other active approaches. The names won't mean much to most listeners. But if you like I'll just throw them out. One of them is deformed special relativity. Another is dynamical triangulations - FLATOW: Well, just give us a little sentence with each one what that might mean. Deformed special - Dr. SMOLIN: Deformed special relativity is an idea that quantum gravity affects, alter the basic equations of special relativity. It turns out in ways that are testable by experiments that are going on now or are going to be launched next year.  Dynamical triangulations is one of several ideas on the basis of which space is made of discreet elements. And one tries to find effects that come from the fact that, the hypothesis that space is discreet.  Loop quantum gravity, which is a direction that I've been privileged to work on sometimes, is something that is a successful unification, at least at the level of the equations, of general relativity and quantum theory. And it has led to a very particular picture of space being made out of discreet elements. And there are consequences of that which people are exploring.  FLATOW: One of the - let me just stop you there and talk about your own work a little bit on loop quantum gravity, because one of its implications is, if I'm correct, I understand it correctly, is that there might be a time before the big bang. The big bang was not the beginning of time? Would that be correct?  Dr. SMOLIN: Well - FLATOW: Or is that too hard for you to explain?  Dr. SMOLIN: No, no, no. It's an old idea, not an idea just to weigh-in of quantum gravity. It's an old idea that quantum mechanical effects remove that first instance of time that we call the initial singularity, where the density of matter, the temperature, everything is infinite, and allow time to proceed to the past so that there was a past.  The calculations that we have done so far using loop quantum gravity strongly suggests - I would not say mathematically prove - but strongly suggests that the theory predicts that that is the case. And it's one of several different ideas on which that expectation holds.  FLATOW: We're going to take a short break and come back and talk lots more with our guests, Lee Smolin, author of The Trouble with Physics, Brian Greene, you know him very well, author of The Elegant Universe, talking about the string theory and other possible competing theories. Our number, 1-800-989-8255. Stay with us. We'll be right back after this short break.  I'm Ira Flatow and this is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.  You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow. We're talking this hour about string theory with my guests, Brian Greene, author of The Elegant Universe. He is professor of math and physics at Columbia University. Lee Smolin, faculty member at the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in Ontario, Canada, author of The Trouble with Physics.  Our number, 1-800-989-8255. Brian, you've invested so much time in string theory. Would this be terribly disappointing if you just keep waiting and nothing happens?  Dr. GREENE: Well, it would be disappointing if we're unable to determine whether theory is right or wrong and we just keep on developing it and we're unable to make contact with experiment.  And were that to really happen over the course of the next, I don't know how many years or whether one should measure it in decades. Certainly I would imagine interest in the theory would drop off because the people who work on string theory are physicists and physicists want to make contact with physical reality.  But what's happened over the course of the last 20 years of development is that the theory has gone through what we call revolutions in our thinking time and time again, which has given a surge of energy, a surge of interest in the theory, which has kept us going even though we've yet to make that desired contact with experiment.  If I just say quickly how we maintain that enthusiasm, I'd say there are really two main reasons. One, the theory is able to embrace all of the major developments in physics having to do with the elementary particles in quantum mechanics that were discovered before string theory in the middle of the 20th Century leading up to the end of the 20th Century.  They all naturally find a home within string theory. And that's very compelling to us because usually a revolution doesn't actually erase the past. It embraces the past but goes further. And that's what string theory seems to be doing.  The other side of it is even without the experimental confirmation, string theory has a very intricate mathematical structure that holds together with a kind of tight logical cohesion. There are checks and rechecks in the calculations, enormous number of consistency checks, and they're all passed. The theory comes through with flying colors every step of the way. And that again keeps us going, keeps us thinking that this theory is at least heading in the right direction.  FLATOW: Well, Lee, what would be wrong with that if things are working like that?  Dr. SMOLIN: You know, it's a delightful situation, because everything that Brian says is true. And because of that I'm, and many other people have spent time on the theory. There are things that, however, it doesn't come close to doing, apart from - I think we've talked enough about experiment and I'm very glad we agree about that.  If you really put quantum mechanics together with a description of space, then we know from general considerations that the notion of space should disappear just like the notion of the trajectory of a particle disappears in quantum mechanics into a more general notion of a quantum state, and then we have the idea that a particle is either a wave of a particle, depending on what questions we ask about it.  The same thing should happen to space in the geometry of space. Now, string theory may address that question. But so far it doesn't very directly whereas other approaches do address that very (unintelligible) - give us a new language to describe space in a way that's consistent completely with the idea that the classical description that we're used to, the idea we're living in this three-dimensional, fixed geometry, goes away.  And so I think the right way, the way that I like to think about it, is that different approaches have different strengths. We've learned something from the different approaches, including string theory, including the other approaches.  But each of them, including string theory, has run into barriers, things that it doesn't easily do. And because of that, I'm convinced - see, I see it something like mountain climbing. I see doing physics as something like a group of people trying to find the summit of a mountain, but in a fog.  And many of us, maybe most of us, who are well trained, know how to climb. You put us down on a hill. We go up hill and we find the summit that's nearest to us, that's uphill from here.  The problem with that is that the real summit is somewhere off in the fog somewhere. And so my sense of the field is that what we are as a field is where people who have discovered the tops of a number of hills and string theory is a very beautiful high hill.  And loop quantum gravity's another one. And dynamical triangulations is another one. And causal sets is another one. And twisted theory is another one. And meanwhile, the summit, maybe these are way stations on the way to the summit. But to get to the real summit we need to cross some perilous ridges or go through some swamps down in the valley and really find it.  And that's why above all what I'm encouraging is that we put the things that kind of work, that work beautifully but run into limitations behind us and we encourage ourselves as working physicists and the younger people to break loose and risk climbing over those perilous ridges in the fog and find the summit.  FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255 is our number. Talking with Brian Greene and Lee Smolin. Let's go to Brenda in Minneapolis. Hi, Brenda.  BRENDA (Caller): Hello.  FLATOW: Hi there.  BRENDA: My suggestion is that they need to get a bigger box, that - FLATOW: A sandbox?  BRENDA: You know, that maybe it's not - maybe they don't need another big super collider. You know? Maybe there's some kind of systematic distortion in how the culture of the people researching string theory are thinking that is distorting their ideas about it or making them all - they need somebody to really think outside of the box and then to think outside of that box, if you understand what I mean.  Dr. SMOLIN: May I address that?  FLATOW: Sure.  BRENDA: Yes.  Dr. SMOLIN: Yes, I know exactly what you mean. And I agree with one strong proviso. And the but is that to be a good scientist you have to be a rebel the way you're suggesting. You have to be willing to think outside the box as you're suggesting.  But you also have to be a conservative. You have to master the tradition of all the knowledge and all the techniques that came before you, because as Brian said, I agree strongly, revolutions don't wipe out the past. They build on the past knowledge.  And to be a good scientist requires - and the great scientists have this, somehow this contradiction internally within each person as well as within the community of scientists, in which we are both very, very deeply conservative and very rebellious.  And that's the trick to doing science.  BRENDA: Well, maybe another way to think about it is it's like a decision tree, the branches. Maybe the tree you're on isn't a tree. Maybe it's just a branch. You need to go back further in the decision tree to find out where you made the mistake of thinking you were at the root when it was just another branch.  Dr. SMOLIN: The only thing I disagree - I agree with you. And the person who can do that and at the same time has mastered the past knowledge so when they find a branch that goes somewhere - your branches are like my hills. So when the person finds the branch that goes somewhere they have the training and the ability to climb it. That's the only thing that I would insist on.  But otherwise I agree with you. And Brian was saying, and I agree, when we make choices about which students, which younger people we encourage, we support, I look for those who are capable of going back in the decision tree, who wonder maybe quantum mechanics really doesn't make any sense. Maybe the problem is there.  And the evidence for that is that some of the greatest physicists alive do worry about those very foundational questions. For example, Roger Penrose or Girard Etoft(ph), they - FLATOW: Do - I'm sorry. Go ahead.  Dr. SMOLIN: Go ahead. No, go ahead.  FLATOW: No, I was just wondering, I'm just following up on her thoughts. I mean, are we at a point now where you just have to sit and scratch your head and think we need some revolution. We may even need a revolution in physics. Maybe we need a new physics.  Dr. SMOLIN: Well, I think we do need a new physics. I think we need experiment and experiment is coming from several directions, from the Large Hadron Collider in Geneva, which comes online next year, from the glass experiment, which is a satellite that will launch next year that will be able to test very, very precisely whether the speed of light is really constant or whether that principle of Einstein's needs modification, from the observations of the cosmic microwave background, which I know Brian works on and I wonder about and people from all points of view in quantum gravity are trying to make predictions about as the experiments improve.  So we need and we are getting new experiments. And nothing can happen without experiment. And I also think we need a revolution or we need - the way that I would put it is we need to complete a revolution.  Einstein started this. Einstein started the revolution in the early 1900s when he - and he was the first person to declare that we needed a quantum theory to break with the physics that went before. And he also brought us relativity theory. And that was the launch of the revolution.  And we're still engaged in that same revolution. It won't be over until this problem of putting together relativity and quantum theory is solved, and not just solved in principle on a pad of paper, but solved in such a way that it leads to new experiments and new predictions for experiments.  FLATOW: Brian, any comment?  Dr. GREENE: Yes. Well, I full well believe that we will, when we do complete this revolution that Lee's referring to, have a completely different view of the universe.  I totally agree with Lee that everything that we know points to space and time not even being fundamental entities. The way I like to think about it is take the concept of temperature. We all know what it means for something to be hot or to be cold. We can experience it.  But scientists taught us that there's an underlying physics to temperature which has to do with how fast particles, molecules, are moving. Molecules move fast, it appears hot. It feels hot. Molecules move slowly, it will feel cold.  So the idea of temperature rests on a foundation of more fundamental ideas, motion of molecules. We think that space and time are like temperature in a sense that they rely upon more fundamental ideas as well.  Now what those more fundamental entities are, the so-called atoms, if you will, that make up space and time, we don't know yet. String theory has some vague suggestions. Loop quantum gravity has some vague suggestions. We're not there yet.  But when we get there, I think we will learn that space and time are not what we thought they are. They are going to morph into something completely unfamiliar. And we'll find that in certain circumstances space and time appear the way we humans interpret those concepts, but fundamentally the universe is not built out of these familiar notions of space and time that we experience.  FLATOW: Talking about string theory this hour on TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR news. Talking with Brian Greene, author of The Elegant Universe, Lee Smolin, author of The Trouble with Physics.  So much in the way that we used to think that gravity only happened here on earth, we expanded it out to, you know, to think of it having, being in other places besides the earth and also being able to measure it. That would be true of space and time? There's this underlying structure to - and is that the right word, structure to it that could change the speed of space, the speed of time, things like that?  Dr. GREENE: It would change the very notion of reality if you really want to be more precise because we all, I believe, most of us, at least, think about reality as existing in a region of space and taking place through some duration of time.  If we learned that those basic ideas, the arena of space and the duration of time, are not concepts that even apply in certain realms, the realm of, say, the very extreme of energy or the very extremes of small size and tiny intervals. If the notions of space and time evaporate, then our whole conception of reality, the whole container of reality, will have evaporated and we'll have to learn to think about physics in the universe completely differently.  FLATOW: So that our reality would just be one special case of all of reality.  Dr. GREENE: Precisely.  FLATOW: Lee? Sounds pretty Twilight Zone.  Dr. SMOLIN: It's not, it's not as far out as it sounds. Really, Ira, it's not. And seeing space is made up of something, atoms, of something more fundamental, you can go a long way with an image that the air looks smooth, the water looks smooth, and we discover that really it's made out of atoms.  But then there are two questions. One question, which Brian addressed, is how do you go from this microscopic description, from the atoms to the smooth properties that we observe? And that's an aspect of it.  Another aspect, which Einstein, part of his genius was to jump directly to, is are there consequences for experiment of the fact that, in his case, matter's made of atoms?  And that's why I keep pushing about experiment so much, because indeed it does seem that if space is made of atoms, there are consequences for how light propagates. And these consequences are checkable by experiments that use observations of light coming from very, very far away to look for very small differences in how light of different colors or different energies propagate.  Now I want to emphasize that we don't have a prediction that makes an absolutely precise prediction for what these experiments should see. And that's a source of great frustration to all of us.  But we have some general ideas about what the effect should be to look for and if those effects are seen, and this could be in as little as a year and a half, two years, from this experiment that I was talking about that looks at gamma rays coming from very, very far away.  Then that will indicate that what Brian is saying is absolutely right. That will be the discovery of the atoms of space in the same way that some of Einstein's discoveries really cemented the idea that matter is made of atoms.  FLATOW: Brian, how do you, as a physicist with things moving so slowly, how do you stop from being impatient?  Dr. GREENE: Well, they're not actually moving that slowly. It may seem slow from the outside because, you know, I've been on your program in the past few years and I don't remember but you probably asked me, are there experimental tests of string theory? And I had to say as yet there aren't. We're working toward it, which is more or less what I'm saying today.  But in terms of the actual field itself, our understanding of the underlying theory, our understanding of the equations, our understanding of the fundamental ideas and how they relate to one another, we've made great strides.  I mean, we have an international meeting every year, a string theory conference that has something like 50 talks. And these talks are generally amazing. They're generally showing how people are making great progress in spite of not having the guide of experiment.  So if it turns out, as Lee is saying, that some of the experiments he's describing or the experiments of the Large Hadron Collider, if in the next couple of years these experiments bear fruit and begin to show us some of the features of the theories that we've been working on for a long time, things will definitely take a major leap forward.  So it's a very exciting time, waiting to see the results of those experiments. And in no way would one want to say that the theory is moving slowly. It perhaps is moving slowly toward these experiments, which are coming online. But the theory itself is developing rapidly. In fact, it's hard to keep up.  FLATOW: All right. We've run out of time. Thank you. Brian Greene, author of The Elegant Universe, professor of math and physics at Columbia University. Lee Smolin, author of The Trouble with Physics, faculty member at the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in Ontario, Canada.  Thank you, gentlemen, for taking time to be with us today.

The math awards are called The Fields Medals, and this morning we have the story of one winner who did not show up for the ceremony. He's a reclusive Russian mathematician named Grigory Perelman. He's credited with helping solve the Poincar\u00e9 Conjecture, a famous math problem about spheres and doughnuts. NPR's David Kestenbaum reports. DAVID KESTENBAUM reporting: This was a math problem that needed a lighthouse because everyone who came near got shipwrecked. Henri Poincar\u00e9 proposed the problem in 1904, and for a century people tried to solve it. Mr. JOHN MORGAN (Chair of Department of Mathematics, Columbia University): And nobody had any luck. KESTENBAUM: This is John Morgan, chair of the math department at Columbia University. Mr. MORGAN: There were many failed attempts. There were always false proofs floating around. There's even an article from the 1960s entitled How Not to Prove the Poincar\u00e9 Conjecture giving all the standard mistakes that the author and others had made. KESTENBAUM: Then in 2002, a Russian mathematician published a short paper online promising a solution. Morgan's reaction was, yeah, yeah, yeah - until the Russian's second paper appeared. His name was Grigory Perelman. He'd studied in the United States, and he made a short trip back to explain his ideas. Mr. MORGAN: When he was first here, he had the long fingernails. When I met him in 2003, the only remnant of that was a long thumbnail. And he would use it to stroke his beard to give him sort of a slightly otherworldly effect. KESTENBAUM: Poincar\u00e9's problem, called the Poincar\u00e9 Conjecture, has to do with how shapes are defined. For instance, you can describe a ball this way. Mr. MORGAN: If you draw a loop on the surface of a ball which you can actually see - if you take any loop, you can shrink it down to a point on the sphere; just think about shrinking it up to the North Pole. KESTENBAUM: That is not true with a doughnut, however. You're shrinking loop could get stuck around the hole. Poincar\u00e9's Conjecture was that the same should hold true if you add a dimension. So however strange or twisted the shapes, anything without a hole in it had to be a sphere; you could shrink any loop on its surface to a point. Now no one can visualize what a four-dimensional universe would look like, which made proving or disproving the conjecture difficult. Mathematicians made progress though, using an unusual idea that seemed more physics than math. An equation that showed how these complicated shapes might smooth themselves out and be seen for what they really were. But serious problems remained - the mathematical equivalent of black holes popping up in the equations - until Grigory Perelman came along. Mr. MORGAN: He worked for five or seven years incredibly intensively on this, and he's incredibly brilliant and powerful. And he did something that I don't think anybody else could have done. KESTENBAUM: Morgan says there are probably fewer than 20 people who understand the proof. He's one of them, and with a colleague he wrote it out in full detail. It fills 473 pages. Morgan was in e-mail contact with Perelman, but slowly that stopped. A British paper tracked Perelman down in St. Petersburg the other week. He was living at his mother's house, and he told the paper, quote, I do not think anything that I say can be of the slightest public interest. Jim Carlson, president of the Clay Mathematics Institute, says this story reminds him that great things have sometimes come from long periods of quiet thought. Mr. JIM CARLSON (President, Clay Mathematics Institute): It's a little bit like, you know, what Newton did during the plague years.

Dr. Graves joins us from the studios of member station WUNC in Chapel Hill. Doctor, welcome. Dr. JOSEPH GRAVES, JR. (Biology, North Carolina AT&T State University): Nice to be here, Ed. GORDON: Let me ask you this question, if I might. I wonder if you pick up on the age-old question of race being a social construct or biological fact? We're seeing so much change over the last decade or so in terms of research. What do you think about that question? Dr. GRAVES: Well, I think that we have clearly settled the question of the existence of biological races in the human species. In other words, human beings don't have biological races the way we define them in other species, and in fact we have been working on this problem - and other biologists and naturalists have been working on this problem - for a good 300 years. So I think the book is actually closed on what scientists understand about the nature of human genetic variation, and how different that is from the socially constructed notion of race used in popular society. And the problem, however, is that many biomedical researchers don't know, do not appreciate this rich history of the discussion of human variation, or variation in general, in species. And the last speaker, I think, is an example of someone who while doing very valuable research, doesn't have that grounding in understanding the discussion of what race is and what it isn't. And the way that these reports end up in the popular media just makes the problem even greater in terms of confusing people. Go ahead. GORDON: Yeah. Isn't it also problematic when non-medical people take a spin of it? I mean I think back to the Tuskegee experiments, which were conducted on African-Americans to see if in fact their immune systems reacted differently to syphilis than it would with an Anglo. But when you marry the two - and laymen tried to explain and marry the two often - the argument, the discussion, gets totally lost. Dr. GRAVES: Yeah. I mean it's part of the general problem of science literacy in the United States. The lay public, including professional journalists, have a really hard time understanding the results from high-level scientific papers like this one. But also on the other hand, the scientists themselves who are writing these papers aren't making it any easier for the layperson. For example, if you take the title of Dr. Freedman's paper, it says admixture mapping identifies 8Q24 as a prostate cancer risk locus in African-American men. Well it turns out, based upon the results of his study and of earlier studies, in fact, I would've titled this paper, Admixture Mapping Identifies 8Q24 as a Prostate Cancer Risk Locus, period. Because there are results and the results of other researchers in the field also show that this locus plays a role in prostate cancer risks in all of the populations they examined. So, therefore, why use the term in African-American men? There's a hidden assumption there, in that this locus, or the products of this locus or the allele or the genetic variant of that locus, is likely to be most responsible for the differential in prostate cancer risk. Now there's no evidence of that in these studies. What they've succeeded in doing is using a particular technique called admixture mapping analysis, which, you know, has been validated many times, in demonstrating the existence of the locus and that genetic variation in the locus is important in prostate cancer risk. What they've been able to do is show that an allelic variant, most likely associated with western Africans, may in fact, be playing a role in the case of African-American men. But then the question is, well, what causes the differential in prostate cancer risk? Is it the genetic variant itself? Or is it something acting on the genetic variant that is differentially located in different populations of men. And without addressing that question, it becomes very difficult to understand how much you're looking at in disease results from a genetic source, and how much comes from the differential, social, and physical environments that African-Americans inhabit in the United States. So the last ten years, I've been trying to make it very clear that on the available evidence addressing health disparity, it is very clear that it's most likely the differently social environment\u2026 GORDON: And the debate\u2026 Dr. GRAVES: Yes.

Is caring for the environment a matter of being a Democrat or a Republican, a liberal or a conservative, a Christian or a non believer? Can preserving biodiversity or finding global warming be something that all of us can work toward together? My next guest thinks so - he certainly does, or more accurately he says we must work together. While admitting that he is a non believer, he's written a book - a really a long letter to a Southern Baptist minister posing and answering that very question: Can caring for the environment cut across the chasm that divides science and religion? Edward O. Wilson - we know as him as E. O. Wilson - is a Pellegrino University Professor Emeritus at Harvard. He's the author of many books, including Sociobiology, The Diversity of Life. His latest book is called The Creation: An Appeal to Save Life on Earth. He is here with in our New York studios. Thank you for coming in today, Dr. Wilson Dr. EDWARD WILSON (Professor of Science, Harvard University): Thanks for having me, Ira. FLATOW: This is a very powerful book. I mean it's a cry for help almost, Dr. Wilson. Dr. WILSON: It's not unusual that the cry should be in that direction out of science. I think the usual approach of secular science is to marginalize religion or even disapprove of it publicly and not expect anything from religious believers or at least religious thinkers. But I've taken precisely the opposite approach and that is to recognize that there is a powerful moral energy and purpose among religious believers - well, as there is among dedicated secular humans as well. But also that numbers count, too; they cannot be ignored even if you are on the secular side and wish to not pay attention to their particular metaphysical belief. So what I've done that I think is new is to extend - and I am so presumptuous as to do it on behalf of science and secular science, secular based science -is to extend the hand of friendship and to say, may we forget for a while our metaphysical differences and the culture war, put them aside, and meet on this common ground of saving the creation - that is saving biodiversity which is in such peril worldwide. FLATOW: Have you gotten any response so far from the theological side? Dr. WILSON: Even though the book was officially released only last week, the response has already been remarkable and very encouraging. A lot of it coming from evangelicals to whom this is apostrophically(ph) that is, you know, representational directed. And most of them favorable they've been directed to me personally. Some of them are enthusiastic. FLATOW: Well, we've heard recently at sort of a turning of the tide among evangelicals saying, the Old Testament says we have to be, you know, protectors of the earth. Dr. WILSON: I think that's always been the dominant interpretation, that it's to take possession of the earth, to be in dominion over it, which is in the Old Testament. And it does not mean I think as one major evangelical leader put it - does not mean to trash it. So there is this strong sense of Judeo-Christian duty, but now it's taking a new - it's gaining new strength and it's taking a new turn. So my book comes out with a call for an alliance of science and religion in this area. It Comes out at a time where the wave is just beginning to develop - a new wave from all across the Judeo-Christian denominational stretch of beliefs and is becoming more conspicuous. FLATOW: And if I might coin a phrase - just in time. Because you lay out the future of bleak, bleak - making your case eloquently here - a bleak, bleak future of the earth. And just the - one of the beginning - you know, we always talk about first sentences of great chapters. One of your chapters begins: The human hammer having fallen, the sixth mast extinction has begun. Dr. WILSON: We've had five before it that humanity had nothing to do with, which stretched out over the last 450 million years roughly at intervals, although its not periodic, of 100 million years. And each one of those has dropped biodiversity to a level that took somewhere between five and ten million years for evolution to restore. We're not that far along yet, but we are definitely in the early stages of it. FLATOW: You say that humanity must make a decision and make it now, right now. Conserve earth's natural heritage or let future generations adjust to a biologically impoverished world. Dr. WILSON: Yeah, one that I would propose to call the arimozoic(ph). Now we're in the Cenozoic, you know, which followed now - which followed the Mesozoic, the age of reptiles or dinosaurs. And the age of mammals, sometimes called the Cenozoic - if we wipe out, as many serious projections have it without abatement of the current human activities that are removing ecosystems and extinguishing species, if we continue to the end of the century, we could have lost or have right on the edge of losing about half of the known species of plants and animals. FLATOW: Very interesting. You seem to believe, based on what you write in this book, that everyone needs to spend time with nature. You write many people seem content to live entirely in the synthetic ecosystems. This, in my mind, is a perversion. It's not the nature of human beings to be cattle in glorified feedlots. Dr. WILSON: Right. It's not enough to look at the animals that we raise in feedlots and take note that they seem to be contented. They're not complaining very much. But the animals that are being raised in feedlots are very far from the full animal. They are not behaving. They are not working out their life cycle in the manners programmed into their brains and into the course of their developing physiology. And I think there is abundant evidence that human beings need nature. They need wild environments. They need at least pastoral environments duplicating the early habitats of human beings in order to develop fully as people. FLATOW: You say that even here in New York City, if you go to someone's apartment who can afford it, they're overlooking Central Park as they might be out in the wild. Dr. WILSON: They're willing to pay top dollar for that view of a little bit of nature, and not just any nature. But what studies have shown are the three main properties of the ideal habitat as seen across cultures, namely where you live most ideally sought is at a height looking out over park land with a body of water. And Central Park, as Olmsted marvelously intuited it, is constructed that way. FLATOW: Talking with E. O. Wilson, author of The Creation: An Appeal to Save Life on Earth, on TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. I'm Ira Flatow. You also talk about an interesting - and it's so wonderful to read your perspective on all kinds of topics. And in this book in particular, it goes in lots of different directions and addresses education, science education, and the shortcomings of it and how you believe that science should be taught to students from the top down. Describe what you mean and why that should be done. Dr. WILSON: Yeah, well that's based on personal experience, 41 years of teaching at Harvard. And during that entire time, almost every year, I taught beginning courses. And I made it by choice for non scientists. I felt that the greatest effect an educator could have at a place like Harvard would be to be passing biology over to our future legislators, our future writers, business leaders, and not the least, talk show hosts. And so in taking that series of taking that approach, I learned a few things about teaching. One of them was to teach top down. And that means to select topics that really matter to people and to which students already have some familiarity, such as why must we die at all. Why do we die of old age? What is the purpose of sex? I can always count on their dropping the Harvard crimson and starting to take notes again when I did that. And so on. And that's what I meant by top down. You said - you can say then to them, let's take this question apart and let's look at it from the view of modern science and in particular biology. And you have their attention. And so that's one principle of teaching that I proposed. But certainly another one was to come at biology with a heavy emphasis on biological diversity: what's out there, how much we know about it, how little we know about it, and how it got there and what's happening to it. FLATOW: How do you get people to come to class, to, you know - people are afraid of science. They just shy away from it. You talk about mathematics in particular in your book that math-phobes(ph) and\u2026 Dr. WILSON: Yeah, I do discuss math phobia. Part of the problem of coming into science by way of physics and chemistry is you certainly attract and give and propel the students who have natural talent and interest in mathematics because those are the subjects in which skills there are effective, particularly in getting started. But as I like to point out to my students, another broad high - and to educators, generally. That's one reason I wrote the book was this book is for educators, college and high school educators. That one broad avenue into understanding science but also careers in science is through the study of higher-level biology. That is the great ranges of diversity, how organisms adapt. And this route then takes the student to a place where they now wish to cut more deeply into the mechanisms of physiology and brain action and so forth that underlie the phenomena of adaptation and biodiversity. But then you've got them set up; you've set them up for learning mathematics. And you can actually teach them, as I did countless mathophobes(ph) at Harvard, enough probability theory, a little statistics, and you can actually get them, as I made sure I did every year, doing something like deriving the binomial equation in order to solve the distribution of frequencies of genes in a population. So they became population geneticists, every one of them. FLATOW: Wow. Dr. WILSON: And we could do it. We managed it. So I hope they dropped a little bit of the math phobia that way. FLATOW: I'm sure they did with you teaching them. Talking with E. O. Wilson, who is author of the new book, The Creation: An Appeal to Save Life on Earth. We're gong to take a short break and come back, talk lots more with Dr. Wilson and take your questions. So don't go away. We'll be right back. I'm Ira Flatow. This is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. (Soundbite of music) FLATOW: You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow with my guests E. O. Wilson, who is, well, he's written all kinds of books, you know, Sociobiology, The Diversity of Life. His latest is called The Creation: An Appeal to Save Life on Earth. It's a terrific book, as all his books are, and very eloquently written, highly recommend it. Our number, 1-800-989-8255. One thing that you write that I've always found to be true is that people care about the environment, but you write but they don't know they care about the environment. They don't know it. Dr. WILSON: Yeah, it's natural I think to human beings to care about it. Now we tend, particularly in this country, to put caring about the environment in terms of the simple process of reducing toxic pollution and making sure that we don't get melanoma from too much sunlight. And now climate warming, we understand that's a big problem. But we really haven't gotten our minds much around the rest of life and the existence of natural ecosystems around the world that are disappearing rapidly. I like always to try to get people's attention by pointing out that estimates by biologists and economists together - the last one made in 1997 but I don't think it's changed an awful lot - of the value of the services that ecosystems give us. That is, you know, the assemblages of natural living plants, animals, and microorganisms, and in service - the services are those that include purification of water, the management of water reserves and the way it's passed to us, pollination, and the renewal of the soil and the very air we breathe, purification of the air we breathe. Those services amount very, very roughly to the gross world product - that is all the combined national products, domestic, national domestic products of the world. And that's in the vicinity of $30 trillion. And we get that scot-free. So that ought to be a reason for not, you know, for not disposing of that facility and trying to substitute at high expense the human contrivances that probably don't do it as well. But there are many, many other reasons why we should start getting our minds around the need for conservation, not the least that the biodiversity of the world, the creation is disappearing so quickly. And that is why, as a scientist feeling some sense of urgency, I then started thinking a little bit differently and a little more deeply about the role of religion. And it occurred to me that the solution really may be political solution, as well as whatever comes out of the will and the hands and the hearts of people could be best recruited if we could get people on both sides of this culture war, the religion and science differences, to collaborate. FLATOW: Can you change people's minds, though? I mean, and let me\u2026 Dr. WILSON: No. FLATOW: \u2026talk about the intelligent design issue which you address in your book. You don't seem to say you're going to change anybody's mind. You just lay out your issue and say, we can agree to disagree but it's in our both interest to do something. Dr. WILSON: That's right. That's why I speak throughout the book - when I bring up the issues of science and religion disputes - that this is not the time, this is not the place in history, in my opinion, to fight out these differences because you're not going to solve them. The chasm cannot be closed. There's too much at stake on both sides. And we just have to evolve toward solutions in the future of a site unseen and nature unknown, but that we do have the power between us to get together and solve one of the great problems of humanity. FLATOW: What do you say to people who say, well, look, you know - and you address this in the book a bit - it's natural, you know, for these, for species who get wiped out all the time, you know, the world has grown up over billions of years with - species come, species go, animals die off, they don't die off. What's so different about this now? Dr. WILSON: Thank you for setting me up there, Ira, or at least setting up a very important point. Because this probably is the single most common objection I get in talking with people of all kinds and different professions and so on about conservation. They say why care about it? Don't worry, evolution - if we believe in evolution - will and always has replaced the lost diversity, and that is true. It's true that some 99 percent of species, maybe more, have disappeared in the course of history of life on earth, but that covers, mind you, hundreds of millions of years. And the figure to keep in mind is not that 99 percent figure, but it is the rate of turnover and the rate of extinction and the rate of birth of new species. And that is, for both those figures - extinction and birth outside of the period of human activity was by fossil evidence mainly, about one species extinct per million species per year being replaced by one species being born per million species per year. That's a very slow turnover. Now I think virtually all students who work on this whole issue of biodiversity and extinction rates and so on agree that most conservatively, that rate has increased due to our influence by an order of 100 times, and very likely 1,000 times if not yet on the order of 1,000 times, soon to be there, with the potential of going faster and faster as we wipe out more and more entire ecosystems. So you can now put that in terms of your bank account, in which there may be a very slow turnover. You've got a very low interest rate, but then you only make a rare withdrawal to replace what you put in. Now increase your withdrawal 100 or 1,000 times while reducing your income, because we're reducing the birth-rate of species by removing their cradles. FLATOW: You know, when I took Ecology 101 in college in the \u201860s, the professor threw out one question I have yet to actually answered myself. I'm going to ask you this question, because I've never fully answered it. And he said every animal, every plant, whatever, has a niche in the ecosystem and the environment. What is the human role in the environment? What is our niche? It seems now to be to destroy everything else. Dr. WILSON: What happened there, I can give you my perception of this. But I would've answered - maybe I couldn't have answered it when you were in college, but I think I can give a reasonable answer now. The human niche, the thing that our brains were built for, was to live primarily on the African savannah as highly social primates, even more so than our closest cousins among the monkeys and apes, and to be vegetarian in part, but also more than other species closer related to us, including most of those monkeys and apes, to be turning to meat. We're beginning to be good predators. We're probably also scavengers. So we're likely dealing with, oh, 10 percent or more of our calories coming in that way. So that's our niche. Open terrain, scattered trees, copses and so on, and that's where we fit in, and it was all we could do, those ancient hominids of which there probably were not more than a few hundred thousand at any given time, maybe even less in periods of time. They fit in very well and they weren't really upsetting any of the balance of anything. But then somehow, somewhere, which is all a matter of dispute among the evolutionary biologists and the anthropologists, we began this runaway development of the cerebrum, intelligence, technology, and pretty soon without losing our appetite for meat and for breeding and producing more of ourselves and the ability to turn a large part of the natural world that was not savannah into savannah - we call it farms and yards and lawns - soon we are sweeping over the world, and we're simply trying to make the whole world our niche. And that in a nutshell is the problem. We neglected almost all of those other species, which have been keeping things in harmony and balance for us, and we're doing it in a way that we're taking away their services, we're taking away the many opportunities at understanding these species offer us, and we are generally messing up big time. FLATOW: Are they going to go first, or are we going to go first? Dr. WILSON: Oh, they will go first. One of my favorite quotes is from Abba Eban, and it's appropriate I think to give it now, especially with the Middle East in turmoil. Once again, he said in the 1967 war, when all else fails, men turn to reason. So what I have in mind is if we don't come awake now, and this is why I so hope that the religious communities will strengthen the movements they already have underway. If we don't come awake now and do something about it, that we'll survive, but it'll be a far less stable world, and it'll be a much pauperized world that our descendants really will dislike us for this. FLATOW: Now you address the Christian community in this book. What about the Muslim and the Buddhists and the other major players in the world now? Dr. WILSON: Well, I of course, actually I address an imaginary Southern Baptist pastor because I grew up Southern Baptist. And I deserve a certain amount of legitimacy, even though I've drifted, shall we say, away. My Southern Baptist pastor is meant to represent especially the Evangelicals. I understand them. I understand, you know, the great and powerful virtues of Evangelical movement, and so they come to represent the Judeo Christian communities as a whole. Looking over the activities of Judeo Christian societies in both the new world and the old world, they have really begun to make important strides in awareness and conservation activities. But at the present time, I have to say Islam and the peoples under the - who are practicing Eastern religions have not moved significantly in that direction. But they could, in very short time, and I'm rather hoping that they will. FLATOW: Talking with E. O. Wilson, author of The Creation: An Appeal to Save Life on Earth on TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. I'm Ira Flatow, heading - let's see if we can head to the phones. Let's go to Laura in San Francisco. Hi, Laura. LAURA (Caller): Hi, thanks for taking my call. I just want to say, Dr. Wilson, this is just an incredible privilege to speak to you. I have a master's in biology, so I worship you. My question is if you would agree with Jared Diamond's arguments in his latest book, I think it's his latest book, Collapse, and if you agree, you know, with his theories about how we're all kind of self-annihilating. Dr. WILSON: Yes I agree in large part, and I think Jared, as he usually does with quite clarity, has put his finger on an important propensity of human behavior. As we were just discussing earlier, maybe the causes of it, you know, how it unfolded it in history - he doesn't deal with much. But in selecting the examples he did and in drawing the lesson for humanity that he drew so graphically, I think he's on target. FLATOW: Thanks for calling. LAURA: Which examples would you say are the most relevant? Dr. WILSON: I'm sorry, what? FLATOW: Which examples were the most relevant, she says. Dr. WILSON: Well, it's nice to have Rapa Nui, also known as Easter Island, because it's simple and we can understand it. That's been somewhat changed a bit by the recent proposal with some evidence behind it that what did in those endemic palm trees, and they're the false forest of Easter Island, was not so much people couldn't stop cutting the trees down, although that certainly was part of it, but it was the introduction of an invasive species, the Polynesian rat, that multiplied and destroyed the seeds and helped move it along. But you know, the basic lesson is the same. That's what Jared and others have done in using Rapa Nui, Easter Island, as a kind of iconic case that people can immediately understand as correct. FLATOW: Do you think that global warming has put biodiversity back on the radar screen? How do you get it on the radar screen? Dr. WILSON: I certainly hope so. FLATOW: You know, everything else that's going on, terrorism -Dr. WILSON: I certainly hope so. I hate to see global warming, the evidence that it's evidently speeding up. It's not faster than we had thought, but you keep it in mind that those good folks of the IPCC, you know the Intergovernmental Program on Climate Change, who did all that hard work for over a decade and continuing now, try to be conservative. They use conservative values on their parameters so that when they said something was going to happen, then it was the more convincing. They could not be called extremists. But now it might appear, it appears that maybe those conservative values are being exceeded. This puts an entirely new complexion on the whole problem of conservation, because if global warming - well, global climate change of all kind. Remember a lot of it has to do with increased rainfall in certain areas and draught and desertification in other areas. If that proceeds the way all models point, then we're going to have a lot of mass extinction occurring just through that alone, and that's why many conservation scientists - and conservation science, incidentally, is a rapidly growing and I think strong discipline of biology, and I hope we'll be seeing it as a future profession for more young scientists. But anyway, we are already laying plans for designing reserves that run parallel to the climate change. For example, north-south for a temperature regime change, in what we call corridors. That is, trying to connect up reserves that now exist and add new ones to connect them so that as the change occurs, plant and animal species can grow their ranges north or south in a way that keeps them alive until humanity as a whole figures out what in the world we can do for a long-term solution. FLATOW: Well, we're going to have to end it there. We could go on for much longer. We'll have to have you back, Dr. Wilson, to come back and talk more with us about global warming and biodiversity. E. O. Wilson, his new book is The Creation: An Appeal to Save Life on Earth. A terrific book, I highly recommend it. He's the Pellegrino University Professor Emeritus at Harvard. Thank you for taking time to be with us. Dr. WILSON: Thank you, Ira. FLATOW: It was my honor.  IRA FLATOW, host:  For the rest of the hour: science, religion and finding common ground. Is caring for the environment a matter of being a Democrat or a Republican, a liberal or a conservative, a Christian or a non believer? Can preserving biodiversity or finding global warming be something that all of us can work toward together?  My next guest thinks so - he certainly does, or more accurately he says we must work together. While admitting that he is a non believer, he's written a book - a really a long letter to a Southern Baptist minister posing and answering that very question: Can caring for the environment cut across the chasm that divides science and religion?  Edward O. Wilson - we know as him as E. O. Wilson - is a Pellegrino University Professor Emeritus at Harvard. He's the author of many books, including Sociobiology, The Diversity of Life. His latest book is called The Creation: An Appeal to Save Life on Earth. He is here with in our New York studios. Thank you for coming in today, Dr. Wilson  Dr. EDWARD WILSON (Professor of Science, Harvard University): Thanks for having me, Ira.  FLATOW: This is a very powerful book. I mean it's a cry for help almost, Dr. Wilson.  Dr. WILSON: It's not unusual that the cry should be in that direction out of science. I think the usual approach of secular science is to marginalize religion or even disapprove of it publicly and not expect anything from religious believers or at least religious thinkers.  But I've taken precisely the opposite approach and that is to recognize that there is a powerful moral energy and purpose among religious believers - well, as there is among dedicated secular humans as well.  But also that numbers count, too; they cannot be ignored even if you are on the secular side and wish to not pay attention to their particular metaphysical belief.  So what I've done that I think is new is to extend - and I am so presumptuous as to do it on behalf of science and secular science, secular based science -is to extend the hand of friendship and to say, may we forget for a while our metaphysical differences and the culture war, put them aside, and meet on this common ground of saving the creation - that is saving biodiversity which is in such peril worldwide.  FLATOW: Have you gotten any response so far from the theological side?  Dr. WILSON: Even though the book was officially released only last week, the response has already been remarkable and very encouraging. A lot of it coming from evangelicals to whom this is apostrophically(ph) that is, you know, representational directed. And most of them favorable they've been directed to me personally. Some of them are enthusiastic.  FLATOW: Well, we've heard recently at sort of a turning of the tide among evangelicals saying, the Old Testament says we have to be, you know, protectors of the earth.  Dr. WILSON: I think that's always been the dominant interpretation, that it's to take possession of the earth, to be in dominion over it, which is in the Old Testament. And it does not mean I think as one major evangelical leader put it - does not mean to trash it.  So there is this strong sense of Judeo-Christian duty, but now it's taking a new - it's gaining new strength and it's taking a new turn. So my book comes out with a call for an alliance of science and religion in this area. It Comes out at a time where the wave is just beginning to develop - a new wave from all across the Judeo-Christian denominational stretch of beliefs and is becoming more conspicuous.  FLATOW: And if I might coin a phrase - just in time. Because you lay out the future of bleak, bleak - making your case eloquently here - a bleak, bleak future of the earth. And just the - one of the beginning - you know, we always talk about first sentences of great chapters. One of your chapters begins: The human hammer having fallen, the sixth mast extinction has begun.  Dr. WILSON: We've had five before it that humanity had nothing to do with, which stretched out over the last 450 million years roughly at intervals, although its not periodic, of 100 million years. And each one of those has dropped biodiversity to a level that took somewhere between five and ten million years for evolution to restore.  We're not that far along yet, but we are definitely in the early stages of it.  FLATOW: You say that humanity must make a decision and make it now, right now. Conserve earth's natural heritage or let future generations adjust to a biologically impoverished world.  Dr. WILSON: Yeah, one that I would propose to call the arimozoic(ph). Now we're in the Cenozoic, you know, which followed now - which followed the Mesozoic, the age of reptiles or dinosaurs. And the age of mammals, sometimes called the Cenozoic - if we wipe out, as many serious projections have it without abatement of the current human activities that are removing ecosystems and extinguishing species, if we continue to the end of the century, we could have lost or have right on the edge of losing about half of the known species of plants and animals.  FLATOW: Very interesting. You seem to believe, based on what you write in this book, that everyone needs to spend time with nature. You write many people seem content to live entirely in the synthetic ecosystems. This, in my mind, is a perversion. It's not the nature of human beings to be cattle in glorified feedlots.  Dr. WILSON: Right. It's not enough to look at the animals that we raise in feedlots and take note that they seem to be contented. They're not complaining very much.  But the animals that are being raised in feedlots are very far from the full animal. They are not behaving. They are not working out their life cycle in the manners programmed into their brains and into the course of their developing physiology.  And I think there is abundant evidence that human beings need nature. They need wild environments. They need at least pastoral environments duplicating the early habitats of human beings in order to develop fully as people.  FLATOW: You say that even here in New York City, if you go to someone's apartment who can afford it, they're overlooking Central Park as they might be out in the wild.  Dr. WILSON: They're willing to pay top dollar for that view of a little bit of nature, and not just any nature. But what studies have shown are the three main properties of the ideal habitat as seen across cultures, namely where you live most ideally sought is at a height looking out over park land with a body of water. And Central Park, as Olmsted marvelously intuited it, is constructed that way.  FLATOW: Talking with E. O. Wilson, author of The Creation: An Appeal to Save Life on Earth, on TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. I'm Ira Flatow.  You also talk about an interesting - and it's so wonderful to read your perspective on all kinds of topics. And in this book in particular, it goes in lots of different directions and addresses education, science education, and the shortcomings of it and how you believe that science should be taught to students from the top down.  Describe what you mean and why that should be done.  Dr. WILSON: Yeah, well that's based on personal experience, 41 years of teaching at Harvard. And during that entire time, almost every year, I taught beginning courses. And I made it by choice for non scientists. I felt that the greatest effect an educator could have at a place like Harvard would be to be passing biology over to our future legislators, our future writers, business leaders, and not the least, talk show hosts.  And so in taking that series of taking that approach, I learned a few things about teaching. One of them was to teach top down. And that means to select topics that really matter to people and to which students already have some familiarity, such as why must we die at all. Why do we die of old age? What is the purpose of sex? I can always count on their dropping the Harvard crimson and starting to take notes again when I did that. And so on.  And that's what I meant by top down. You said - you can say then to them, let's take this question apart and let's look at it from the view of modern science and in particular biology. And you have their attention.  And so that's one principle of teaching that I proposed. But certainly another one was to come at biology with a heavy emphasis on biological diversity: what's out there, how much we know about it, how little we know about it, and how it got there and what's happening to it.  FLATOW: How do you get people to come to class, to, you know - people are afraid of science. They just shy away from it. You talk about mathematics in particular in your book that math-phobes(ph) and\u2026  Dr. WILSON: Yeah, I do discuss math phobia. Part of the problem of coming into science by way of physics and chemistry is you certainly attract and give and propel the students who have natural talent and interest in mathematics because those are the subjects in which skills there are effective, particularly in getting started.  But as I like to point out to my students, another broad high - and to educators, generally. That's one reason I wrote the book was this book is for educators, college and high school educators. That one broad avenue into understanding science but also careers in science is through the study of higher-level biology. That is the great ranges of diversity, how organisms adapt.  And this route then takes the student to a place where they now wish to cut more deeply into the mechanisms of physiology and brain action and so forth that underlie the phenomena of adaptation and biodiversity.  But then you've got them set up; you've set them up for learning mathematics. And you can actually teach them, as I did countless mathophobes(ph) at Harvard, enough probability theory, a little statistics, and you can actually get them, as I made sure I did every year, doing something like deriving the binomial equation in order to solve the distribution of frequencies of genes in a population. So they became population geneticists, every one of them.  FLATOW: Wow.  Dr. WILSON: And we could do it. We managed it. So I hope they dropped a little bit of the math phobia that way.  FLATOW: I'm sure they did with you teaching them. Talking with E. O. Wilson, who is author of the new book, The Creation: An Appeal to Save Life on Earth. We're gong to take a short break and come back, talk lots more with Dr. Wilson and take your questions. So don't go away. We'll be right back.  I'm Ira Flatow. This is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.  (Soundbite of music)  FLATOW: You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow with my guests E. O. Wilson, who is, well, he's written all kinds of books, you know, Sociobiology, The Diversity of Life. His latest is called The Creation: An Appeal to Save Life on Earth. It's a terrific book, as all his books are, and very eloquently written, highly recommend it.  Our number, 1-800-989-8255. One thing that you write that I've always found to be true is that people care about the environment, but you write but they don't know they care about the environment. They don't know it.  Dr. WILSON: Yeah, it's natural I think to human beings to care about it. Now we tend, particularly in this country, to put caring about the environment in terms of the simple process of reducing toxic pollution and making sure that we don't get melanoma from too much sunlight.  And now climate warming, we understand that's a big problem. But we really haven't gotten our minds much around the rest of life and the existence of natural ecosystems around the world that are disappearing rapidly.  I like always to try to get people's attention by pointing out that estimates by biologists and economists together - the last one made in 1997 but I don't think it's changed an awful lot - of the value of the services that ecosystems give us. That is, you know, the assemblages of natural living plants, animals, and microorganisms, and in service - the services are those that include purification of water, the management of water reserves and the way it's passed to us, pollination, and the renewal of the soil and the very air we breathe, purification of the air we breathe.  Those services amount very, very roughly to the gross world product - that is all the combined national products, domestic, national domestic products of the world. And that's in the vicinity of $30 trillion.  And we get that scot-free. So that ought to be a reason for not, you know, for not disposing of that facility and trying to substitute at high expense the human contrivances that probably don't do it as well.  But there are many, many other reasons why we should start getting our minds around the need for conservation, not the least that the biodiversity of the world, the creation is disappearing so quickly.  And that is why, as a scientist feeling some sense of urgency, I then started thinking a little bit differently and a little more deeply about the role of religion. And it occurred to me that the solution really may be political solution, as well as whatever comes out of the will and the hands and the hearts of people could be best recruited if we could get people on both sides of this culture war, the religion and science differences, to collaborate.  FLATOW: Can you change people's minds, though? I mean, and let me\u2026  Dr. WILSON: No.  FLATOW: \u2026talk about the intelligent design issue which you address in your book. You don't seem to say you're going to change anybody's mind. You just lay out your issue and say, we can agree to disagree but it's in our both interest to do something.  Dr. WILSON: That's right. That's why I speak throughout the book - when I bring up the issues of science and religion disputes - that this is not the time, this is not the place in history, in my opinion, to fight out these differences because you're not going to solve them. The chasm cannot be closed. There's too much at stake on both sides. And we just have to evolve toward solutions in the future of a site unseen and nature unknown, but that we do have the power between us to get together and solve one of the great problems of humanity.  FLATOW: What do you say to people who say, well, look, you know - and you address this in the book a bit - it's natural, you know, for these, for species who get wiped out all the time, you know, the world has grown up over billions of years with - species come, species go, animals die off, they don't die off. What's so different about this now?  Dr. WILSON: Thank you for setting me up there, Ira, or at least setting up a very important point. Because this probably is the single most common objection I get in talking with people of all kinds and different professions and so on about conservation. They say why care about it? Don't worry, evolution - if we believe in evolution - will and always has replaced the lost diversity, and that is true. It's true that some 99 percent of species, maybe more, have disappeared in the course of history of life on earth, but that covers, mind you, hundreds of millions of years.  And the figure to keep in mind is not that 99 percent figure, but it is the rate of turnover and the rate of extinction and the rate of birth of new species. And that is, for both those figures - extinction and birth outside of the period of human activity was by fossil evidence mainly, about one species extinct per million species per year being replaced by one species being born per million species per year. That's a very slow turnover.  Now I think virtually all students who work on this whole issue of biodiversity and extinction rates and so on agree that most conservatively, that rate has increased due to our influence by an order of 100 times, and very likely 1,000 times if not yet on the order of 1,000 times, soon to be there, with the potential of going faster and faster as we wipe out more and more entire ecosystems.  So you can now put that in terms of your bank account, in which there may be a very slow turnover. You've got a very low interest rate, but then you only make a rare withdrawal to replace what you put in. Now increase your withdrawal 100 or 1,000 times while reducing your income, because we're reducing the birth-rate of species by removing their cradles.  FLATOW: You know, when I took Ecology 101 in college in the \u201860s, the professor threw out one question I have yet to actually answered myself. I'm going to ask you this question, because I've never fully answered it. And he said every animal, every plant, whatever, has a niche in the ecosystem and the environment. What is the human role in the environment? What is our niche? It seems now to be to destroy everything else.  Dr. WILSON: What happened there, I can give you my perception of this. But I would've answered - maybe I couldn't have answered it when you were in college, but I think I can give a reasonable answer now. The human niche, the thing that our brains were built for, was to live primarily on the African savannah as highly social primates, even more so than our closest cousins among the monkeys and apes, and to be vegetarian in part, but also more than other species closer related to us, including most of those monkeys and apes, to be turning to meat.  We're beginning to be good predators. We're probably also scavengers. So we're likely dealing with, oh, 10 percent or more of our calories coming in that way. So that's our niche. Open terrain, scattered trees, copses and so on, and that's where we fit in, and it was all we could do, those ancient hominids of which there probably were not more than a few hundred thousand at any given time, maybe even less in periods of time. They fit in very well and they weren't really upsetting any of the balance of anything.  But then somehow, somewhere, which is all a matter of dispute among the evolutionary biologists and the anthropologists, we began this runaway development of the cerebrum, intelligence, technology, and pretty soon without losing our appetite for meat and for breeding and producing more of ourselves and the ability to turn a large part of the natural world that was not savannah into savannah - we call it farms and yards and lawns - soon we are sweeping over the world, and we're simply trying to make the whole world our niche.  And that in a nutshell is the problem. We neglected almost all of those other species, which have been keeping things in harmony and balance for us, and we're doing it in a way that we're taking away their services, we're taking away the many opportunities at understanding these species offer us, and we are generally messing up big time.  FLATOW: Are they going to go first, or are we going to go first?  Dr. WILSON: Oh, they will go first. One of my favorite quotes is from Abba Eban, and it's appropriate I think to give it now, especially with the Middle East in turmoil. Once again, he said in the 1967 war, when all else fails, men turn to reason. So what I have in mind is if we don't come awake now, and this is why I so hope that the religious communities will strengthen the movements they already have underway. If we don't come awake now and do something about it, that we'll survive, but it'll be a far less stable world, and it'll be a much pauperized world that our descendants really will dislike us for this.  FLATOW: Now you address the Christian community in this book. What about the Muslim and the Buddhists and the other major players in the world now?  Dr. WILSON: Well, I of course, actually I address an imaginary Southern Baptist pastor because I grew up Southern Baptist. And I deserve a certain amount of legitimacy, even though I've drifted, shall we say, away. My Southern Baptist pastor is meant to represent especially the Evangelicals. I understand them. I understand, you know, the great and powerful virtues of Evangelical movement, and so they come to represent the Judeo Christian communities as a whole.  Looking over the activities of Judeo Christian societies in both the new world and the old world, they have really begun to make important strides in awareness and conservation activities. But at the present time, I have to say Islam and the peoples under the - who are practicing Eastern religions have not moved significantly in that direction. But they could, in very short time, and I'm rather hoping that they will.  FLATOW: Talking with E. O. Wilson, author of The Creation: An Appeal to Save Life on Earth on TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. I'm Ira Flatow, heading - let's see if we can head to the phones. Let's go to Laura in San Francisco. Hi, Laura.  LAURA (Caller): Hi, thanks for taking my call. I just want to say, Dr. Wilson, this is just an incredible privilege to speak to you. I have a master's in biology, so I worship you. My question is if you would agree with Jared Diamond's arguments in his latest book, I think it's his latest book, Collapse, and if you agree, you know, with his theories about how we're all kind of self-annihilating.  Dr. WILSON: Yes I agree in large part, and I think Jared, as he usually does with quite clarity, has put his finger on an important propensity of human behavior. As we were just discussing earlier, maybe the causes of it, you know, how it unfolded it in history - he doesn't deal with much. But in selecting the examples he did and in drawing the lesson for humanity that he drew so graphically, I think he's on target.  FLATOW: Thanks for calling.  LAURA: Which examples would you say are the most relevant?  Dr. WILSON: I'm sorry, what?  FLATOW: Which examples were the most relevant, she says.  Dr. WILSON: Well, it's nice to have Rapa Nui, also known as Easter Island, because it's simple and we can understand it. That's been somewhat changed a bit by the recent proposal with some evidence behind it that what did in those endemic palm trees, and they're the false forest of Easter Island, was not so much people couldn't stop cutting the trees down, although that certainly was part of it, but it was the introduction of an invasive species, the Polynesian rat, that multiplied and destroyed the seeds and helped move it along.  But you know, the basic lesson is the same. That's what Jared and others have done in using Rapa Nui, Easter Island, as a kind of iconic case that people can immediately understand as correct.  FLATOW: Do you think that global warming has put biodiversity back on the radar screen? How do you get it on the radar screen?  Dr. WILSON: I certainly hope so.  FLATOW: You know, everything else that's going on, terrorism - Dr. WILSON: I certainly hope so. I hate to see global warming, the evidence that it's evidently speeding up. It's not faster than we had thought, but you keep it in mind that those good folks of the IPCC, you know the Intergovernmental Program on Climate Change, who did all that hard work for over a decade and continuing now, try to be conservative.

Numerous symbols are carved across the block in rows. Experts say the block dates back almost 3,000 years and was created by people from the Olmec civilization. They were an early Central American people who rose to prominence before the heyday of the Maya. Here's NPR's Christopher Joyce. CHRISTOPHER JOYCE: In archeology, people dream about this kind of thing. Here's what happened. Workers in the state of Veracruz in southern Mexico were quarrying rock. They piled some debris by the side of the road. Someone spotted a greenish block of stone with inscriptions on it. Local authorities kept it for several years until archeologists figured out that the inscriptions might just be writing, very ancient writing. Mr. STEPHEN HOUSTON (Archeologist, Brown University): When I saw the block, as did the rest of us, we knew we were in the presence of something very special. JOYCE: Stephen Houston is an archeologist at Brown University. Mr. HOUSTON: It had completely unknown signs, but they were arranged in these long sequences we felt just had to be a new form of writing. Writings of this sort from the ancient world come up so rarely. JOYCE: It was a once in a lifetime discovery, Houston says. The inscriptions are hieroglyphics: sixty-two small drawings in rows. But Houston says this wasn't art. Mr. HOUSTON: It's not just a set of symbols that might be placed together the way you might see on, let's say, a medieval French or English painting. Rather, they're arranged in the sequence that is meant to reflect a language with grammatical elements and with word order that makes sense. JOYCE: There are 28 different glyphs, as archeologists call them for short. Some look like vegetables. One looks like a sharp awl or a pick. Some symbols are repeated, such as one that looks like an insect. Houston suspects that one might be some sort of punctuation. Some sequences of symbols are separated from the rest in what look like poetic couplets. Not all of these symbols are unfamiliar to archeologists. Mary Pohl at Florida State University is an expert on the Olmec. She's analyzed Olmec symbols on jewelry and a cylindrical seal that dates almost as far back as the inscribed tablet. She says a few of the symbols are clearly written versions of carved stone objects - like an ear of corn - previously found at Olmec archeological sites. Ms. MARY POHL (Archeologist, Florida State University): One sign looks actually like a corncob. Others are rather unique. This insect-like sign is something I haven't seen before. JOYCE: Pohl says these objects, and thus probably the writing, had special value in rituals. Ms. POHL: We see that the writing is very closely connected with rituals and the early religious beliefs, because they are taking the ritual carvings and putting them into glyphs and making writing out of them. And all of this is occurring in the context of the emergence of early kings, the development of centralized power and stratified society. JOYCE: The tablet and inscriptions are described in the journal Science. Its date is based on other artifacts found nearby and may need further confirmation. Houston and scientists from Mexico who first identified the text say they have no idea what it actually says. With no previous text to work from, deciphering it will be very difficult. But you're going to try? Mr. HOUSTON: We'll do our best! (Soundbite of laughter) JOYCE: Should I call you back in a few weeks? (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. HOUSTON: I think it's going to take longer than that. JOYCE: What are needed are more texts for comparison. Archeologists say there are lots of Olmec sites in Mexico that are still unexplored, and any one could hold the key to reading the oldest known language in the Americas. Christopher Joyce, NPR News.

Ms. MARY POHL (Archeologist, Florida State University): One sign looks actually like a corncob. Others are rather unique. This insect-like sign is something I haven't seen before.  JOYCE: Pohl says these objects, and thus probably the writing, had special value in rituals.  Ms. POHL: We see that the writing is very closely connected with rituals and the early religious beliefs, because they are taking the ritual carvings and putting them into glyphs and making writing out of them. And all of this is occurring in the context of the emergence of early kings, the development of centralized power and stratified society.  JOYCE: The tablet and inscriptions are described in the journal Science. Its date is based on other artifacts found nearby and may need further confirmation.  Houston and scientists from Mexico who first identified the text say they have no idea what it actually says. With no previous text to work from, deciphering it will be very difficult.  But you're going to try?  Mr. HOUSTON: We'll do our best!  (Soundbite of laughter)  JOYCE: Should I call you back in a few weeks?  (Soundbite of laughter)  Mr. HOUSTON: I think it's going to take longer than that.  JOYCE: What are needed are more texts for comparison. Archeologists say there are lots of Olmec sites in Mexico that are still unexplored, and any one could hold the key to reading the oldest known language in the Americas.

I'm Michele Norris. The FBI says California is the likely source of E. coli-contaminated spinach that's made nearly 100 people sick in 20 states. It's being blamed for at least one death. Investigators still don't know exactly where the tainted produce came from, but late today, Earthbound Farms of California decided to voluntarily pull all the company's spinach from store shelves. NPR's John McChesney has been following today's developments and he joins us now from Sausalito. John, why is the company recalling their spinach before the FDA identifies the source of the E. coli? JOHN MCCHESNEY: Well, Michele, because of all of the epidemiological evidence, that is the statistical evidence, points to products produced by Earthbound Farms. They don't have a hard science connection yet with products from Earthbound farms, but interviews with the patients, the people who've been infected, indicates that they have eaten products from Earthbound Farms. So right now, that epidemiological evidence points at this company, but the FDA is careful to say it's not limited necessarily to this company. There may be other companies involved, other products involved. NORRIS: But for now, what can you tell us about this one company, Earthbound Farms? MCCHESNEY: Earthbound is legendary in the organic food business. They were started back in 1986 by Drew and Myra Goodman. They were the first company to bag the spring lettuce. They now serve, they say, 22 million salads a week to American consumers. They are sold in 74% of American supermarkets. So they're a big deal in the organic food business. NORRIS: And John, as we said, the scare involves at least 20 states at this point. Do investigators have any idea how so much spinach got contaminiated? MCCHESNEY: Not really. And I don't think they even know, you know, the total quantity. I mean, we're talking about 100 people getting sick. But you know, organic farmers use manure as their fertilizer instead of chemical fertilizer. And if the manure isn't properly composted to where the temperature gets high enough to kill these pathogens, then you've got a problem and that could be the issue here. There are other possible contamination sources, as well. NORRIS: We heard today that washing the spinach isn't enough to make it safe. Why not? And I'm also wondering if any other bagged produce might be involved. MCCHESNEY: Well, apparently, according to the FDA people, the E. coli gets so engrained into the tissue of the spinach, you can't really wash it off. You can wash your spinach, but it won't do any good. And one of the things they're saying, it's not just bagged produce now. Earthbound Farms and other companies pack their stuff in so-called plastic clamshells, you know, the plastic boxes. That also should not be used. What the FDA is saying, don't eat any fresh spinach product or any mixed product that has fresh spinach in it. NORRIS: Thank you John, that's NPR's John McChesney reporting from Northern California.

And that is noise. Researchers say noise, as you know, can cause stress, irritation and even shorten your lifespan, and if you feel like the world is getting louder all the time, you're right. From the train ride to the multiplex, the world's volume has been turned up and all of us are paying the price. But why do some people appear to thrive in noisy spaces. I mean, I know some kids who can't do their homework without the TV or the iPod blaring in their ears. So just what is it? What defines noise? Is it just an unwanted sound or does it have to be a certain volume? Why is one person's really, really cool ringtone another person's headache? My next guest has taken his thoughts about something many of us can do without and turned them into a book. Bart Kosko is a professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering at the Signal and Image Processing Institute at the University of Southern California. He's author of many books, Fuzzy Thinking and Nanotime. His new book is called, appropriately, Noise. He joins us from the studios of KUSC in Los Angeles. Welcome to the program. Professor BART KOSKO (University of Southern California): Hi. FLATOW: Hi there. Can you define noise for us? Professor KOSKO: Sure. Noise, as you hinted at, is a signal you don't like. And what a signal is is something that conveys energy or information. So what noise really is, Ira, is unwanted energy. Any kind of interfering sound, or it could be visual noise, as in a TV or a computer screen. FLATOW: Let me just correct myself. You're at KPCC, not KUSC. Professor KOSKO: Yes I am. FLATOW: I want to give full credit to KPCC in Pasadena there. So what do we know about the health effects of noise? Professor KOSKO: Most are bad. There are a few good, but most are bad. As you said, noise increases stress levels and stress in turn increases a variety of maladies from increase of the probability of high blood pressure and heart attack and stroke and those kinds of things. But most importantly, Ira, is noise induced hearing loss. That's the big problem from noise. It's always been a problem, but with the increase in more powerful, less expensive digital gadgets, noise induced hearing loss has increased, especially with young people. A study in 1998 found in JAMA - the Journal of American Medical Association -that about 10 percent or so of teenagers had hearing loss comparable to old folks. And apparently it's much higher now, and it's only going to get higher with cheaper phones, again, that you can speak into at anyplace and headsets that you can blast that noise directly into your ear canal. FLATOW: And, you know, you wonder about it because you could be sitting next to somebody with a pair of headsets on and you hear it almost as loud as they hear it. Professor KOSKO: Exactly. FLATOW: At least it's almost perceptible that way. And that's dangerous. What happens in your ear to lose your hearing? Professor KOSKO: You lose the little hairs deep inside the inner ear, or cochlea, that detect frequencies. And you could think of them as a comb, although it's sort of rolled up. And each little tooth on the comb detects a specific frequency. Once lost, it's gone forever. And so if you get a bump in the head or through simple aging processes, you'll lose a few. But through noise energy shot into the ear canal, especially above about 85 or 90 decibels - for example the level of a lawnmower - if you do that, you'll bend and break several. And you won't be able to detect those frequencies, or in some cases, Ira, you will always detect those because you bend the little hairs, the tooth of the comb, and you get tinnitus. This constant ringing of the ear, and there's really no cure for that. FLATOW: Talking with Bart Kosko, author of a new book, Noise. He is talking about what makes noise. Our number, 1-800-989-8255. I mentioned our world is getting noisier. Is it measurable to a scientist to actually measure how much noisier our world is today? Professor KOSKO: Oh, it sure is. And a citizen can purchase an inexpensive noise meter for $50 to $100. There's been a lot of efforts to measure cities, for example in Europe, unlike in this country. All the major cities in the European Union have published a noise map. In fact, you can go online and look, for example, at London. Look at its sonic level. It looks like a contour map, different colors indicating how loud it is on average. We don't have that here. And as a noise pollution, an anti-noise pollution advocate, I encourage all listeners to approach their local city council and simply ask them when do we get our own noise map. We can also measure things in our - well, it's important because, first it's going to affect your decision about where you're want to live. It's going to affect, more importantly maybe, the decision of builders and remodelers about the steps they can take. And they can take steps to reduce the increasing noise pollution. Another case where there's lots of noise pollution we could measure is in the ocean. And the oceans apparently are about 10 times noisier than they were 50 years ago. And at any given time, there's a million plus boats afloat with depth finders. And the Navy has a variety of sonar. Some of them, for example, low-frequency sonars blast much more loudly than the takeoff of, say, the space shuttle. About 230 decibels. That's tended to -FLATOW: No kidding. Professor KOSKO: - apparently kill certain kinds of small creatures. Small beaked whales. In other words, after certain naval exercises, for example, in the Bahamas, four hours later they find several small beaked whales washed up on the shore dead, bleeding from their eyes and in effect from the ears. And just in general, for example, humpback whales, they have to sing longer to maintain the same signal to noise ratio. Now sea creatures, Ira, you know, adapt in a very different way than land creatures. Water conveys sound more efficiently. And so when you start noising that up, as we have unintentionally in a variety of ways, you interfere with something natural selection has taken many million years to tune. These signal processes. There was an experiment I talked about in the book Noise, controlled experiment with biologist worked with the Navy. When they turned on that Naval sonar, the whale songs increased substantially. When they turned it off they went back to their normal length. FLATOW: Talking with Bart Kosko, author of Noise on TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY on NPR News. I'm Ira Flatow. One interesting part about your book is it's almost like a ying and a yang aspect to it. One half of the book you talk about the threats from noise, and then in the other half you tell us how beneficial noises can be to us. Professor KOSKO: Exactly. I would call it a fuzzy view. Noise is bad and noise is good simultaneously. And that's something, Ira, for me that occurred in my own research. For years as someone working with signals, initially in neural systems and brain systems and then in others in engineering, we try to conquer noise. We often call it the war on noise, and we have a variety of schemes for doing that. The broadcast system we're using now probably uses a couple hundred of these different schemes in various ways as we go to from analog to digital signals and back and forth. And it was a great surprise when a lot of us found - in my case in the '90s, others in the '80s - that sometimes noise actually helped a system. In particular, neural type systems or systems that trying to learn patterns and recognize patterns after they have learned them. We thought it was anomalous at first, but it turned out to be much like the phenomena of chaos. It sometimes related to it that it was really the rule and not the exception. That, in general, for non-linear systems, complex systems, often a small amount of noise can help. Too much noise hurts. FLATOW: Yeah. You have an illustration in the book of putting noise into a picture that's been washed out purposely. Is it random noise makes us actually perceive the picture better? Professor KOSKO: It does indeed. We're not sure whether that's just in the page or in the brain or some combination of both. But if you take almost any image and, as you say, wash it out and add to it random pixel noise, at first it will get sharper. You'll see more edges and contours. Add still more noise, it'll get still sharper. But if you keep doing it, you'll destroy the image, you'll wash it away. And that reflects, again, what we call an inverted U-curve where a little bit of noise, in some cases, a lot of noise, is a good thing. But if too much of it then you get back the classical world, which we viewed all noise is bad. What we sometimes call the Shannon world. The world of classical information theory and really the world of engineering post-World War II. FLATOW: Do you think we have skewed the bad side too much? Professor KOSKO: I think we have at that level. Because certainly one of the areas of research people like me work on - nanotechnology and quantum communication systems - are the benefits of noise. And partly because when you're at that tiny level, the universe is inherently noisy, very noisy. It starts even with molecules and the Brownian motion of air molecules. But the further down you go in scale, the more random the nature of things. And so you, in effect, you have to cut a deal with the devil here. But because, Ira, because that noise is fundamentally a form of free energy, you can exploit it, as nature appears to have done in many cases. FLATOW: All right. We're going to take a short break and come back and talk more with Professor Kosko. Bart Kosko, author of the new book, Noise. And we'll take your calls. Our number, 1-800-989-8255. Stay with us. We'll be right back after the short break. (Soundbite of music) FLATOW: You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow. We're talking this hour about noise with Bart Kosko, professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering at USC and author of the book Noise. 1-800-989-8255. We were talking about some of the benefits of noise, Dr. Kosko, and I needed to ask you - one of my daughters really seems to be able to work better on her homework whenever she's in a very noisy situation. Why is that? Professor KOSKO: You know, that's a great question. It touches on a lot of research. But because noise is a form unwanted energy and therefore energy, it does tend to energize certain kind of systems. Well, what kind? Especially the on-off kinds that our brains are made of. The neurons, the switches. And in fact, the main established benefits of noise in the animal kingdom and devices and mathematics have almost always concerned threshold-type devices. And, again, since your brain consists of about 100 billion of those, it's a natural conjecture that we get energized by noise. For example, even the neurons talking to one another create noise for the other neurons. The neurons seem to have adapted to that. But I have had many experience with that myself. And I encourage people, Ira, to strengthen their brain this way by trying to read a book in a more crowded environment. Not to associate reading and thinking just with hothouse quiet activities. If I could tell a story. I recently took the California bar exam to become a licensed lawyer in California as sort of a pastime or hobby. And it was a three-day exam and two of the days, the first and third days, were keyboard exams. The middle day was multiple choice. And on those keyboard days, I had brought earplugs as had many of the other hundreds of candidates. And didn't need them. Because once the wild tapping at the keyboard started, it produced a wonderful background sea of noise that suppressed other noises. But more than that, it created that effect we're talking about. It energized my thoughts, and I was very short on sleep as I think other people were. In contrast, on the multiple choice day, you could hear a pin drop and it was dull. I found myself wanting to fall asleep. I had missed that energy from the crowd. That kind of energetic background white noise, which studies show and the images we talked about before show visually, actually improve how non-linear systems work. FLATOW: That would be interesting - to make that translation you say the studies show visually. Are there studies that show that in a noisy background you do work better or things do work out better for you? Professor KOSKO: There have been a few. There'd been others that shown that interference can harm things. For example, you wouldn't at first order want to turn up the volume in the midst of a surgery and those kind of interferences. No one has, to my knowledge, looked just for a noise benefit there. That is called a stochastic resonance effect, by the way. Other instances they have, but it remains largely unproven at this point. FLATOW: There's some research for anybody wanting to do that next paper. You seem to say in the visual side, there is that threshold, there's a limit, in other words, where they go too far. You muddy the picture instead of clear it up. I imagine the same thing in the auditory world is happening also. Professor KOSKO: That's right. And in the book I talk about a formal result that I and some others arrived at called Forbidden Interval Theorems. Now that's a big name, but what it means is mathematically, as long as the average level of the noise doesn't fall within a certain boundary, as long as it's less than that or larger than that, you'll always have some kind of noise benefit. And that's a guide we can use to see, first of all, whether a system we're dealing with, a visual system, an auditory system, can potentially benefit from noise and whether we're in the forbidden interval or not. And then once we decide that we are not in there, where noise will be a benefit, we have a variety of techniques that we can use to find the optimal level of noise to add to the system. FLATOW: Gary in St. Louis. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. GARY (Caller): Yes. I have, when I fly I have a pair of noise canceling headphones. And they work well in just making it easier to pick up the sounds I want to hear in the headphone. But I realize they work by just basically making additional noise but in the outside frequencies. Are there any detriments to that? Whether, in other words, if I were using them alot, am I giving myself a false sense of security? And I realize possibly it's not helping hearing loss but I'm talking about other physiological detriments to loud noises. Professor KOSKO: Interesting question. You're right that the way it works in principle is to build a model of the noise and take its reverse, its mirror image, and add it to it and hence to cancel it, and further it has to track the noise source, so it has to be adaptive, and by the way it often uses something like a neural network, the very system we use to find the optimal level of noise to add to a system we add here to cancel it. If you try to cancel a very loud noise, you'll tend to hear a background hum. And I guess in principle if that were loud enough, it could interfere with your hearing and other processes, but I haven't heard of any medical effects associated with it. FLATOW: Thank you, Gary. GARY: Thank you. FLATOW: You know, there have been - on the Internet now there are these places that will sell you a ringtone for your phone that is at such a high frequency that only people under 30 can hear it. You know what I'm talking about. Professor KOSKO: Yes. FLATOW: Because we lose our hearing, our high frequencies, as we get older. And there are now even devices I've been reading about that people will put up outside a restaurant or in a public place to scare teenagers away by transmitting this high frequency, but older folks don't hear it. Can you be damaged by a high frequency that you can hear that's very loud? Professor KOSKO: Sure you can. And as you point out, as you get older - we talked about the comb that represents the frequencies - those upper-right portion of that comb, those hairs - a code for - high frequencies tend to go first, and that's often - what's often said, for example, why you can detect at a distance or get more sonority out of a man's voice than a woman's voice, because a woman's voice tends to have more of a higher frequency component. FLATOW: So if you're subjected to a very high frequency, even though you can't hear it you could still be damaging your ear? Professor KOSKO: Yes you could. At some point, though, we simply don't have frequency detectors at that level. But in effect if you blew a dog whistle at that level, you could damage those hairs, those cilia hairs. FLATOW: Let's go to Bonnie in Sheldon, New York. Hi, Bonnie. BONNIE (Caller): Hi. I'll take this answer off the air because I'm on my way to work, but I wondered if the doctor had any opinion on the noise that the wind turbines cause. There's a lot of controversy about that, testimonials from a lot of people, and there are some doctors who have said that it causes headaches, dizziness, upset stomach, it can damage your ears. I am wondering if he has any information and if he has a Web site. Thank you. FLATOW: Thank you, Bonnie. Professor KOSKO: I'll take the last one first. Yes I do have a Web site. If you just type my name, K-O-S-K-O, it will come at USC, and you can, for example, look at some of these noise papers and see the images where we add noise and improve the system or the visual image. In the case of wind turbines, in general when you create power or transduce power, you do make a lot of noise. It does tend to be dangerous. It's not something you want to close to. Noise falls off with the inverse square of the distance, sound does, so to be a little bit close to a noise source makes a very big difference. I think most of those systems are designed with the idea that people won't be working around them unless they're OSHA protected, wearing appropriate hearing gear and other types of gear. FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255 is our number. Let's see if Jeff in Portland is there. Hi, Jeff, welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. JEFF (Caller): Hey, thanks for taking my call. Hey, I've noticed lately that a lot of my friends, including myself, have a hard time falling asleep unless they have like a fan going or some white noise of some sort, and I just wondered if you had any comments about that. Professor KOSKO: I'm the same way, Jeff. I use a fan to create a white noise effect, in particular to mask background noise, especially if you sleep late in the morning and you have a lot of car noises. For example, there are something like 90 million leaf blowers in this country and the number is growing. And impulse noises of various types can take over, but a fan tends to do that. It also, the white noise effect, if it's not too energetic, it can sound like a fountain, a waterfall. It does tend to soothe one. It energizes somewhat, but at the same time if it's not too powerful, it helps one sleep. JEFF: Is there any link to, like, just the randomness of that, or? Professor KOSKO: I'm not real sure why that happens. I do cite one study in the book Noise. If you have too much white noise at too high of energy level, it can damage the brains of baby rats, but that's the only negative I know of it. But we're not quite sure why that works. I've seen in some cases energetic white noise, the background hubbub of several conversations in a restaurant, will energize you and help keep you alert. In this case, a little bit tends to soothe you and help you sleep. It may just be the effect of masking other noises in the background. FLATOW: Thanks, Jeff. Our number, 1-800-989-8255. You talk about white noise, and we've heard that term for years. Are there other colors of noise that noise engineers talk about? Professor KOSKO: All kinds of colors, Ira. There are pink noises and brown noises and black noises. That refers to the frequency spectrum. If you could wear special glasses like you see in some of the Star Trek sci-fi movies so that you could see the entire electromagnetic spectrum or a good chunk of it, and when you're listening to a sound, if you could see its frequency as engineers see through a prism they call the 4A Transform, then white noise would be the ideal case where the frequency is very flat and very long. Now that can't really happen, because it would have to be so long and so flat that there would be infinite energy, but you can get a good approximation. If it's, instead of being flat, if it tapers a bit, it tends to be pink noise, and that sounds softer, and in fact the human ear will hear that pink noise as white noise. But any noise that isn't white, we call colored, and if it has got a lot of bumps in it in the spectrum, it's called brown noise. Now there are many cases where we use brown noise models to model phenomena. For example, the distribution of temperatures in a city seems to fit a model of brown noise. And if the spectrum is really clumpy and jagged, we call it black noise. Now there are mathematical definitions of these, and they are not precise, they are fuzzy boundaries here, but we transition from an artificial ideal world of white noise, of a flat spectrum. As that spectrum becomes degraded, it gets more and more colorful, all the way down to black. FLATOW: Let's go to Vin in Essex, Massachusetts. Hi, Vin. VIN (Caller): Hi, good afternoon. FLATOW: Hi there. VIN: Thanks for taking my call. My question is regarding the amount of digital noise that everybody has as far as music goes. I'm an old guy that, you know, was brought up on albums and so forth, and I really don't like to listen to music these days on headphones at all, and I'm wondering, you know, with the amount of compression that all of these MP3s are using, whether that might inherently add to the, I guess, to sort of the dissonance of noise. Professor KOSKO: I don't think the compression does, that's a different effect, but again if you're wearing a headset or ear pod devices, ear nubs, you're shooting noise, sound energy directly into the ear canal. It's very dangerous to do. If you do it at a loud volume, you're engaging in a high risk activity. You definitely should have your hearing checked at least once a year. Young people tend to be doing this more frequently than older, but all people do. And as we mentioned before, those who listen on headsets, one good thing about that is that you're not imposing noise costs on third parties, on others. The downside is you're hurting your hearing. By the time you realize you've hurt your hearing, it's too late to correct it. There's no known cure for that. And further, if you listen to headsets in loud environments, as so many people do, you tend to up the volume and hurt the hearing all the more. FLATOW: Thanks for calling, Vin. Our number, 1-800-989-8255. We're talking with Bart Kosko, author of the new book called Noise on TALK OF THE NATION Science Friday from NPR News. The fact that we are all in the iPod generation and listening through headsets and shooting this noise directly into our ears means that somewhere down the road, we're all going to be more deaf than this generation or have hearing problems worse. Professor KOSKO: It sure does. And it looks that way that - again, it began with, say, rock musicians, and there are movements afoot from rock musicians themselves to help us become aware of hearing damage. But young people who listen to music at rock concert levels, which is about 130 decibels, almost surely have some kind of damage, and the younger you are when you damage your hearing, Ira, the worse it's going to be over time because you may continue to lose things through the aging process, but in addition to that you're probably going to be cranking up the volume just to compensate for the hearing loss in your youth, and you'll just speed up the process. FLATOW: Is there, and this may be a little bit far a field of your range, but talking about noise and isolation - are we in a generation where people who are in this generation are losing their interaction with the rest of the world because they're so clammed up inside these, you know, these ear pods? Professor KOSKO: I think that's a part of it. One effect I've noticed, if you're standing in a checkout line, there are certain norms and customs you follow. Most people try not to look at the driver's license of the person writing the check, for example, and we all just bide our time, but when that cell phone rings and someone pulls it out, they are no longer in that little society. They're suddenly talking to the person on the other end of the cell phone, often quite loudly, and once they have crossed that line, you know, they don't seem to go back, and that sends a signal to everyone else that that's the rule of fair play now and it tends to only go up. I've noticed also when the airplane lands and people stand up to get their language is when the cell phones come out, and it seems as if more and more people treat others like rental cars here, that we talk directly and loudly about our personal events, you know, really not thinking about the noise effects we're imposing on others. It is getting worse, by the way, and I think at least in places like California, if that continues, it'll go the way of secondhand smoke and may very well lead to cell phone limits. FLATOW: You think we'll have laws against noise pollution? Professor KOSKO: We do have laws against it right now, but against cell phone usage in public places, I think that's inevitable. If people simple won't tone it down, that'll happen, and again the unintended consequences as more people use these phones, it encourages others to do it both because you need to do that to maintain the signal to noise ratio, you need to speak more loudly, in effect, when everyone else is being loud, and two, you see everyone else doing it and so why not you? FLATOW: Is there a cutting edge in noise research? Where would it be? Professor KOSKO: I think it is - there are edges in noise research. One would be in the case of canceling noise, and that's always going to be ongoing. But I'll say again if we take it to the very small level, to the quantum level, to the nanotechnology level, we have to learn to adapt to a very noisy environment. I did an experiment with some students. We took a carbon nano-tube, a very tiny piece of carbon, it looks like rolled-up chicken wire, the carbon molecule, and I used it as an antenna to recognize signals, and we showed that if you add very faint electrical noise, the kind of stuff that's in the background anyway at that level, you can improve how it receives signals. Now one thing you could do, Ira - no one's done this - but you could take those tiny carbon nano-tubes and use those to replace those missing hairs in your inner ear, in theory greatly improve it, to increase your frequency spectrum and make it more redundant. And I know there are a lot of research groups looking at that kind of thing. Likewise at the very forefront of quantum computing. We're trying to do is design new kinds of computer that have to work in the presence of noise. I and my students and others have shown that by adding noise to the quantum channel, you can actually improve the overall amount of information that you can send through it, within limits, and we hope to test that someday. FLATOW: Well, we all have our assignments for the weekend, those nano-tubes. Professor KOSKO: We do indeed. FLATOW: Thank you very much, Dr. Kosko. Professor KOSKO: Thank you. FLATOW: Bart Kosko is professor in the department of electrical engineering at the Signal and Image Processing Institute at USC. His book is called Noise, very interesting.  IRA FLATOW, host:  Up next this hour, something all of us are intimately familiar with. And that is noise. Researchers say noise, as you know, can cause stress, irritation and even shorten your lifespan, and if you feel like the world is getting louder all the time, you're right. From the train ride to the multiplex, the world's volume has been turned up and all of us are paying the price.  But why do some people appear to thrive in noisy spaces. I mean, I know some kids who can't do their homework without the TV or the iPod blaring in their ears. So just what is it? What defines noise? Is it just an unwanted sound or does it have to be a certain volume? Why is one person's really, really cool ringtone another person's headache?  My next guest has taken his thoughts about something many of us can do without and turned them into a book. Bart Kosko is a professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering at the Signal and Image Processing Institute at the University of Southern California. He's author of many books, Fuzzy Thinking and Nanotime. His new book is called, appropriately, Noise. He joins us from the studios of KUSC in Los Angeles. Welcome to the program.  Professor BART KOSKO (University of Southern California): Hi.  FLATOW: Hi there. Can you define noise for us?  Professor KOSKO: Sure. Noise, as you hinted at, is a signal you don't like. And what a signal is is something that conveys energy or information. So what noise really is, Ira, is unwanted energy. Any kind of interfering sound, or it could be visual noise, as in a TV or a computer screen.  FLATOW: Let me just correct myself. You're at KPCC, not KUSC.  Professor KOSKO: Yes I am.  FLATOW: I want to give full credit to KPCC in Pasadena there. So what do we know about the health effects of noise?  Professor KOSKO: Most are bad. There are a few good, but most are bad. As you said, noise increases stress levels and stress in turn increases a variety of maladies from increase of the probability of high blood pressure and heart attack and stroke and those kinds of things.  But most importantly, Ira, is noise induced hearing loss. That's the big problem from noise. It's always been a problem, but with the increase in more powerful, less expensive digital gadgets, noise induced hearing loss has increased, especially with young people.  A study in 1998 found in JAMA - the Journal of American Medical Association -that about 10 percent or so of teenagers had hearing loss comparable to old folks. And apparently it's much higher now, and it's only going to get higher with cheaper phones, again, that you can speak into at anyplace and headsets that you can blast that noise directly into your ear canal.  FLATOW: And, you know, you wonder about it because you could be sitting next to somebody with a pair of headsets on and you hear it almost as loud as they hear it.  Professor KOSKO: Exactly.  FLATOW: At least it's almost perceptible that way. And that's dangerous. What happens in your ear to lose your hearing?  Professor KOSKO: You lose the little hairs deep inside the inner ear, or cochlea, that detect frequencies. And you could think of them as a comb, although it's sort of rolled up. And each little tooth on the comb detects a specific frequency. Once lost, it's gone forever.  And so if you get a bump in the head or through simple aging processes, you'll lose a few. But through noise energy shot into the ear canal, especially above about 85 or 90 decibels - for example the level of a lawnmower - if you do that, you'll bend and break several. And you won't be able to detect those frequencies, or in some cases, Ira, you will always detect those because you bend the little hairs, the tooth of the comb, and you get tinnitus. This constant ringing of the ear, and there's really no cure for that.  FLATOW: Talking with Bart Kosko, author of a new book, Noise. He is talking about what makes noise. Our number, 1-800-989-8255.  I mentioned our world is getting noisier. Is it measurable to a scientist to actually measure how much noisier our world is today?  Professor KOSKO: Oh, it sure is. And a citizen can purchase an inexpensive noise meter for $50 to $100. There's been a lot of efforts to measure cities, for example in Europe, unlike in this country. All the major cities in the European Union have published a noise map. In fact, you can go online and look, for example, at London. Look at its sonic level. It looks like a contour map, different colors indicating how loud it is on average.  We don't have that here. And as a noise pollution, an anti-noise pollution advocate, I encourage all listeners to approach their local city council and simply ask them when do we get our own noise map. We can also measure things in our - well, it's important because, first it's going to affect your decision about where you're want to live. It's going to affect, more importantly maybe, the decision of builders and remodelers about the steps they can take. And they can take steps to reduce the increasing noise pollution.  Another case where there's lots of noise pollution we could measure is in the ocean. And the oceans apparently are about 10 times noisier than they were 50 years ago. And at any given time, there's a million plus boats afloat with depth finders. And the Navy has a variety of sonar. Some of them, for example, low-frequency sonars blast much more loudly than the takeoff of, say, the space shuttle. About 230 decibels. That's tended to - FLATOW: No kidding.  Professor KOSKO: - apparently kill certain kinds of small creatures. Small beaked whales. In other words, after certain naval exercises, for example, in the Bahamas, four hours later they find several small beaked whales washed up on the shore dead, bleeding from their eyes and in effect from the ears.  And just in general, for example, humpback whales, they have to sing longer to maintain the same signal to noise ratio. Now sea creatures, Ira, you know, adapt in a very different way than land creatures. Water conveys sound more efficiently.  And so when you start noising that up, as we have unintentionally in a variety of ways, you interfere with something natural selection has taken many million years to tune. These signal processes. There was an experiment I talked about in the book Noise, controlled experiment with biologist worked with the Navy. When they turned on that Naval sonar, the whale songs increased substantially. When they turned it off they went back to their normal length.  FLATOW: Talking with Bart Kosko, author of Noise on TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY on NPR News. I'm Ira Flatow.  One interesting part about your book is it's almost like a ying and a yang aspect to it. One half of the book you talk about the threats from noise, and then in the other half you tell us how beneficial noises can be to us.  Professor KOSKO: Exactly. I would call it a fuzzy view. Noise is bad and noise is good simultaneously. And that's something, Ira, for me that occurred in my own research. For years as someone working with signals, initially in neural systems and brain systems and then in others in engineering, we try to conquer noise. We often call it the war on noise, and we have a variety of schemes for doing that.  The broadcast system we're using now probably uses a couple hundred of these different schemes in various ways as we go to from analog to digital signals and back and forth. And it was a great surprise when a lot of us found - in my case in the '90s, others in the '80s - that sometimes noise actually helped a system.  In particular, neural type systems or systems that trying to learn patterns and recognize patterns after they have learned them. We thought it was anomalous at first, but it turned out to be much like the phenomena of chaos. It sometimes related to it that it was really the rule and not the exception.  That, in general, for non-linear systems, complex systems, often a small amount of noise can help. Too much noise hurts.  FLATOW: Yeah. You have an illustration in the book of putting noise into a picture that's been washed out purposely. Is it random noise makes us actually perceive the picture better?  Professor KOSKO: It does indeed. We're not sure whether that's just in the page or in the brain or some combination of both. But if you take almost any image and, as you say, wash it out and add to it random pixel noise, at first it will get sharper. You'll see more edges and contours. Add still more noise, it'll get still sharper. But if you keep doing it, you'll destroy the image, you'll wash it away.  And that reflects, again, what we call an inverted U-curve where a little bit of noise, in some cases, a lot of noise, is a good thing. But if too much of it then you get back the classical world, which we viewed all noise is bad. What we sometimes call the Shannon world. The world of classical information theory and really the world of engineering post-World War II.  FLATOW: Do you think we have skewed the bad side too much?  Professor KOSKO: I think we have at that level. Because certainly one of the areas of research people like me work on - nanotechnology and quantum communication systems - are the benefits of noise. And partly because when you're at that tiny level, the universe is inherently noisy, very noisy.  It starts even with molecules and the Brownian motion of air molecules. But the further down you go in scale, the more random the nature of things. And so you, in effect, you have to cut a deal with the devil here.  But because, Ira, because that noise is fundamentally a form of free energy, you can exploit it, as nature appears to have done in many cases.  FLATOW: All right. We're going to take a short break and come back and talk more with Professor Kosko. Bart Kosko, author of the new book, Noise. And we'll take your calls. Our number, 1-800-989-8255. Stay with us. We'll be right back after the short break.  (Soundbite of music)  FLATOW: You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow. We're talking this hour about noise with Bart Kosko, professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering at USC and author of the book Noise. 1-800-989-8255.  We were talking about some of the benefits of noise, Dr. Kosko, and I needed to ask you - one of my daughters really seems to be able to work better on her homework whenever she's in a very noisy situation. Why is that?  Professor KOSKO: You know, that's a great question. It touches on a lot of research. But because noise is a form unwanted energy and therefore energy, it does tend to energize certain kind of systems. Well, what kind?  Especially the on-off kinds that our brains are made of. The neurons, the switches. And in fact, the main established benefits of noise in the animal kingdom and devices and mathematics have almost always concerned threshold-type devices. And, again, since your brain consists of about 100 billion of those, it's a natural conjecture that we get energized by noise.  For example, even the neurons talking to one another create noise for the other neurons. The neurons seem to have adapted to that. But I have had many experience with that myself. And I encourage people, Ira, to strengthen their brain this way by trying to read a book in a more crowded environment. Not to associate reading and thinking just with hothouse quiet activities.  If I could tell a story. I recently took the California bar exam to become a licensed lawyer in California as sort of a pastime or hobby. And it was a three-day exam and two of the days, the first and third days, were keyboard exams. The middle day was multiple choice.  And on those keyboard days, I had brought earplugs as had many of the other hundreds of candidates. And didn't need them. Because once the wild tapping at the keyboard started, it produced a wonderful background sea of noise that suppressed other noises. But more than that, it created that effect we're talking about. It energized my thoughts, and I was very short on sleep as I think other people were.  In contrast, on the multiple choice day, you could hear a pin drop and it was dull. I found myself wanting to fall asleep. I had missed that energy from the crowd. That kind of energetic background white noise, which studies show and the images we talked about before show visually, actually improve how non-linear systems work.  FLATOW: That would be interesting - to make that translation you say the studies show visually. Are there studies that show that in a noisy background you do work better or things do work out better for you?  Professor KOSKO: There have been a few. There'd been others that shown that interference can harm things. For example, you wouldn't at first order want to turn up the volume in the midst of a surgery and those kind of interferences. No one has, to my knowledge, looked just for a noise benefit there. That is called a stochastic resonance effect, by the way. Other instances they have, but it remains largely unproven at this point.  FLATOW: There's some research for anybody wanting to do that next paper. You seem to say in the visual side, there is that threshold, there's a limit, in other words, where they go too far. You muddy the picture instead of clear it up. I imagine the same thing in the auditory world is happening also.  Professor KOSKO: That's right. And in the book I talk about a formal result that I and some others arrived at called Forbidden Interval Theorems. Now that's a big name, but what it means is mathematically, as long as the average level of the noise doesn't fall within a certain boundary, as long as it's less than that or larger than that, you'll always have some kind of noise benefit.  And that's a guide we can use to see, first of all, whether a system we're dealing with, a visual system, an auditory system, can potentially benefit from noise and whether we're in the forbidden interval or not. And then once we decide that we are not in there, where noise will be a benefit, we have a variety of techniques that we can use to find the optimal level of noise to add to the system.  FLATOW: Gary in St. Louis. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY.  GARY (Caller): Yes. I have, when I fly I have a pair of noise canceling headphones. And they work well in just making it easier to pick up the sounds I want to hear in the headphone. But I realize they work by just basically making additional noise but in the outside frequencies. Are there any detriments to that? Whether, in other words, if I were using them alot, am I giving myself a false sense of security? And I realize possibly it's not helping hearing loss but I'm talking about other physiological detriments to loud noises.  Professor KOSKO: Interesting question. You're right that the way it works in principle is to build a model of the noise and take its reverse, its mirror image, and add it to it and hence to cancel it, and further it has to track the noise source, so it has to be adaptive, and by the way it often uses something like a neural network, the very system we use to find the optimal level of noise to add to a system we add here to cancel it.  If you try to cancel a very loud noise, you'll tend to hear a background hum. And I guess in principle if that were loud enough, it could interfere with your hearing and other processes, but I haven't heard of any medical effects associated with it.  FLATOW: Thank you, Gary.  GARY: Thank you.  FLATOW: You know, there have been - on the Internet now there are these places that will sell you a ringtone for your phone that is at such a high frequency that only people under 30 can hear it. You know what I'm talking about.  Professor KOSKO: Yes.  FLATOW: Because we lose our hearing, our high frequencies, as we get older. And there are now even devices I've been reading about that people will put up outside a restaurant or in a public place to scare teenagers away by transmitting this high frequency, but older folks don't hear it.  Can you be damaged by a high frequency that you can hear that's very loud?  Professor KOSKO: Sure you can. And as you point out, as you get older - we talked about the comb that represents the frequencies - those upper-right portion of that comb, those hairs - a code for - high frequencies tend to go first, and that's often - what's often said, for example, why you can detect at a distance or get more sonority out of a man's voice than a woman's voice, because a woman's voice tends to have more of a higher frequency component.  FLATOW: So if you're subjected to a very high frequency, even though you can't hear it you could still be damaging your ear?  Professor KOSKO: Yes you could. At some point, though, we simply don't have frequency detectors at that level. But in effect if you blew a dog whistle at that level, you could damage those hairs, those cilia hairs.  FLATOW: Let's go to Bonnie in Sheldon, New York. Hi, Bonnie.  BONNIE (Caller): Hi. I'll take this answer off the air because I'm on my way to work, but I wondered if the doctor had any opinion on the noise that the wind turbines cause. There's a lot of controversy about that, testimonials from a lot of people, and there are some doctors who have said that it causes headaches, dizziness, upset stomach, it can damage your ears. I am wondering if he has any information and if he has a Web site. Thank you.  FLATOW: Thank you, Bonnie.  Professor KOSKO: I'll take the last one first. Yes I do have a Web site. If you just type my name, K-O-S-K-O, it will come at USC, and you can, for example, look at some of these noise papers and see the images where we add noise and improve the system or the visual image.  In the case of wind turbines, in general when you create power or transduce power, you do make a lot of noise. It does tend to be dangerous. It's not something you want to close to. Noise falls off with the inverse square of the distance, sound does, so to be a little bit close to a noise source makes a very big difference. I think most of those systems are designed with the idea that people won't be working around them unless they're OSHA protected, wearing appropriate hearing gear and other types of gear.  FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255 is our number. Let's see if Jeff in Portland is there. Hi, Jeff, welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY.  JEFF (Caller): Hey, thanks for taking my call. Hey, I've noticed lately that a lot of my friends, including myself, have a hard time falling asleep unless they have like a fan going or some white noise of some sort, and I just wondered if you had any comments about that.  Professor KOSKO: I'm the same way, Jeff. I use a fan to create a white noise effect, in particular to mask background noise, especially if you sleep late in the morning and you have a lot of car noises. For example, there are something like 90 million leaf blowers in this country and the number is growing. And impulse noises of various types can take over, but a fan tends to do that.  It also, the white noise effect, if it's not too energetic, it can sound like a fountain, a waterfall. It does tend to soothe one. It energizes somewhat, but at the same time if it's not too powerful, it helps one sleep.  JEFF: Is there any link to, like, just the randomness of that, or?  Professor KOSKO: I'm not real sure why that happens. I do cite one study in the book Noise. If you have too much white noise at too high of energy level, it can damage the brains of baby rats, but that's the only negative I know of it. But we're not quite sure why that works. I've seen in some cases energetic white noise, the background hubbub of several conversations in a restaurant, will energize you and help keep you alert. In this case, a little bit tends to soothe you and help you sleep. It may just be the effect of masking other noises in the background.  FLATOW: Thanks, Jeff. Our number, 1-800-989-8255.  You talk about white noise, and we've heard that term for years. Are there other colors of noise that noise engineers talk about?  Professor KOSKO: All kinds of colors, Ira. There are pink noises and brown noises and black noises. That refers to the frequency spectrum. If you could wear special glasses like you see in some of the Star Trek sci-fi movies so that you could see the entire electromagnetic spectrum or a good chunk of it, and when you're listening to a sound, if you could see its frequency as engineers see through a prism they call the 4A Transform, then white noise would be the ideal case where the frequency is very flat and very long.  Now that can't really happen, because it would have to be so long and so flat that there would be infinite energy, but you can get a good approximation. If it's, instead of being flat, if it tapers a bit, it tends to be pink noise, and that sounds softer, and in fact the human ear will hear that pink noise as white noise. But any noise that isn't white, we call colored, and if it has got a lot of bumps in it in the spectrum, it's called brown noise. Now there are many cases where we use brown noise models to model phenomena. For example, the distribution of temperatures in a city seems to fit a model of brown noise.  And if the spectrum is really clumpy and jagged, we call it black noise. Now there are mathematical definitions of these, and they are not precise, they are fuzzy boundaries here, but we transition from an artificial ideal world of white noise, of a flat spectrum. As that spectrum becomes degraded, it gets more and more colorful, all the way down to black.  FLATOW: Let's go to Vin in Essex, Massachusetts. Hi, Vin.  VIN (Caller): Hi, good afternoon.  FLATOW: Hi there.  VIN: Thanks for taking my call. My question is regarding the amount of digital noise that everybody has as far as music goes. I'm an old guy that, you know, was brought up on albums and so forth, and I really don't like to listen to music these days on headphones at all, and I'm wondering, you know, with the amount of compression that all of these MP3s are using, whether that might inherently add to the, I guess, to sort of the dissonance of noise.  Professor KOSKO: I don't think the compression does, that's a different effect, but again if you're wearing a headset or ear pod devices, ear nubs, you're shooting noise, sound energy directly into the ear canal. It's very dangerous to do. If you do it at a loud volume, you're engaging in a high risk activity. You definitely should have your hearing checked at least once a year.  Young people tend to be doing this more frequently than older, but all people do. And as we mentioned before, those who listen on headsets, one good thing about that is that you're not imposing noise costs on third parties, on others. The downside is you're hurting your hearing. By the time you realize you've hurt your hearing, it's too late to correct it. There's no known cure for that. And further, if you listen to headsets in loud environments, as so many people do, you tend to up the volume and hurt the hearing all the more.  FLATOW: Thanks for calling, Vin. Our number, 1-800-989-8255. We're talking with Bart Kosko, author of the new book called Noise on TALK OF THE NATION Science Friday from NPR News.  The fact that we are all in the iPod generation and listening through headsets and shooting this noise directly into our ears means that somewhere down the road, we're all going to be more deaf than this generation or have hearing problems worse.  Professor KOSKO: It sure does. And it looks that way that - again, it began with, say, rock musicians, and there are movements afoot from rock musicians themselves to help us become aware of hearing damage. But young people who listen to music at rock concert levels, which is about 130 decibels, almost surely have some kind of damage, and the younger you are when you damage your hearing, Ira, the worse it's going to be over time because you may continue to lose things through the aging process, but in addition to that you're probably going to be cranking up the volume just to compensate for the hearing loss in your youth, and you'll just speed up the process.  FLATOW: Is there, and this may be a little bit far a field of your range, but talking about noise and isolation - are we in a generation where people who are in this generation are losing their interaction with the rest of the world because they're so clammed up inside these, you know, these ear pods?  Professor KOSKO: I think that's a part of it. One effect I've noticed, if you're standing in a checkout line, there are certain norms and customs you follow. Most people try not to look at the driver's license of the person writing the check, for example, and we all just bide our time, but when that cell phone rings and someone pulls it out, they are no longer in that little society. They're suddenly talking to the person on the other end of the cell phone, often quite loudly, and once they have crossed that line, you know, they don't seem to go back, and that sends a signal to everyone else that that's the rule of fair play now and it tends to only go up.  I've noticed also when the airplane lands and people stand up to get their language is when the cell phones come out, and it seems as if more and more people treat others like rental cars here, that we talk directly and loudly about our personal events, you know, really not thinking about the noise effects we're imposing on others.  It is getting worse, by the way, and I think at least in places like California, if that continues, it'll go the way of secondhand smoke and may very well lead to cell phone limits.  FLATOW: You think we'll have laws against noise pollution?  Professor KOSKO: We do have laws against it right now, but against cell phone usage in public places, I think that's inevitable. If people simple won't tone it down, that'll happen, and again the unintended consequences as more people use these phones, it encourages others to do it both because you need to do that to maintain the signal to noise ratio, you need to speak more loudly, in effect, when everyone else is being loud, and two, you see everyone else doing it and so why not you?  FLATOW: Is there a cutting edge in noise research? Where would it be?  Professor KOSKO: I think it is - there are edges in noise research. One would be in the case of canceling noise, and that's always going to be ongoing. But I'll say again if we take it to the very small level, to the quantum level, to the nanotechnology level, we have to learn to adapt to a very noisy environment.  I did an experiment with some students. We took a carbon nano-tube, a very tiny piece of carbon, it looks like rolled-up chicken wire, the carbon molecule, and I used it as an antenna to recognize signals, and we showed that if you add very faint electrical noise, the kind of stuff that's in the background anyway at that level, you can improve how it receives signals.  Now one thing you could do, Ira - no one's done this - but you could take those tiny carbon nano-tubes and use those to replace those missing hairs in your inner ear, in theory greatly improve it, to increase your frequency spectrum and make it more redundant. And I know there are a lot of research groups looking at that kind of thing.  Likewise at the very forefront of quantum computing. We're trying to do is design new kinds of computer that have to work in the presence of noise. I and my students and others have shown that by adding noise to the quantum channel, you can actually improve the overall amount of information that you can send through it, within limits, and we hope to test that someday.  FLATOW: Well, we all have our assignments for the weekend, those nano-tubes.  Professor KOSKO: We do indeed.  FLATOW: Thank you very much, Dr. Kosko.  Professor KOSKO: Thank you.  FLATOW: Bart Kosko is professor in the department of electrical engineering at the Signal and Image Processing Institute at USC. His book is called Noise, very interesting.

Gerald Tuskan is a plant geneticist at the Environmental Sciences Division at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY, Dr. Tuskan. Dr. GERALD TUSKAN (Oak Ridge National Laboratory): It's great to be here. FLATOW: This is so exciting that it made the cover of Science magazine. Dr. TUSKAN: It did, yes. We were very honored to have the cover in this issue. FLATOW: Why do you think it deserves the cover? Dr. TUSKAN: Well, poplar black cottonwood is the first tree genome to be sequenced and annotated and assembled and as such, we've gotten a window into the evolution and function of genes unique to woody plants and perennial lifestyles. Arabidopsis and rice had their genomes sequenced and annotated and released publicly several years ago, but these are (unintelligible) annual plants. And for the first time we get to look into evolutionary history and function of genes related to large perennial woody organisms. FLATOW: And possible use them as a source of ethanol. We're going to get into all of these. We have to go to a break Dr. Tuskan, but stay with us. Dr. TUSKAN: Will do. FLATOW: Everybody can stay with us. We'll be talking more about the sequencing of the gene for the first tree - the poplar tree - with Gerry Tuskan of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Stay with us. We'll be right back - take your questions. Don't go away. (Soundbite of music) FLATOW: You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow. We're talking this hour with Gerald Tuskan, plant geneticist in the Environmental Sciences Division at the Oak Ridge National Laboratories in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. Our number, 1-800-989-8255. Dr. Tuskan is talking about his project, the first of its kind, to sequence a genome of a tree. We've had a couple of weedy kind of perennial plants but now we've got a tree sequence, and the fact that it's a poplar tree is very important because, Dr. Tuskan, that might help us solve our energy crisis, correct? Dr. TUSKAN: That's right. Poplar is one of the model candidate species for dedicated energy crop development here in the U. S. It's a very fast growing plant and the biomass, or the cell wall, of poplar is uniquely suited for ethanol conversion, and so we're very excited about the opportunity to accelerate the domestication of poplar for the application to biofuels. FLATOW: Could you bioengineer the plant to make it better suited for making ethanol? Dr. TUSKAN: Most certainly. Poplar, whether it's here in the U. S. or in Asia or in Europe, really represent undomesticated wild organisms that because of evolutionary history have chemistries that are well suited for biochemical conversion to ethanol. But there's a lot that we could do to increase the efficiency of conversion or the cost efficiency of actually producing the biomass. So we're looking at modifying the plant cell wall to increase the amount of cellulose that's deposited in the cell wall and we're also looking at increasing the harvestable yield off a given acre of land. FLATOW: We haven't gotten to the point where you can successfully create ethanol out of trees and woody plants like that yet, have we? Dr. TUSKAN: Well, we have in the lab and we have pilot scale conversion projects that have demonstrated that poplar in particular is one of the best feed stocks for the production of ethanol. The issue right now is to reduce the cost of that ethanol per gallon to make it more competitive with gasoline and increase the yield of ethanol per ton of biomass. And so we've demonstrated that it is feasible, that you do get high yielding high amounts of ethanol coming from lignocellulosic feed stocks, but we need to increase the yield of ethanol and reduce the price of that ethanol. FLATOW: What makes it a better feed stock than, let's say, corn for making ethanol? Dr. TUSKAN: Yeah, the current corn ethanol industry is based on starch produced mainly in the kernel and so there's a limit in how much starch you can produce per unit area of land. Alternatively, crops like hybrid poplar or switch grass are grown for energy and it's the lignocellulosic component of the cell wall. So the productivity per unit of land is higher, because we use the sugar that's captured through photosynthesis into glucose and then is ultimately fixed into the cell wall in the form of cellulose and hemicellulose, so the amount of convertible sugar per unit area is higher with these lignocellulosic feed stocks. FLATOW: Can you make it easier by genetically modifying the plant to get more energy out of it and to also make it easier in the laboratory to convert it into ethanol or into - or in the factory - to convert it into ethanol? Dr. TUSKAN: Most certainly. The plant cell wall contains three major components - lignant, which is a polyphenolic compound, cellulose and hemicellulose, and cellulose and hemicellulose are carbohydrates and can be fermented into ethanol. The lignant, on the other hand, is like the glue that holds the whole thing together. And inherently poplar has about 30 percent lignant, and we believe we can reduce that effectively to less than 20 percent and not affect plant growth, but increase the amount of cellulose per dry weight and increase the deconstruction of the cell wall by having less lignant present in the modified cell wall. FLATOW: And unlike corn, this plant will grow virtually anywhere, won't it? Dr. TUSKAN: It has a very, very wide range of adaptability. It occurs naturally from the Arctic Circle in Alaska down to Baja, California as Populus trichocarpa, Black Cottonwood, but there are relatives of Populus that are adapted to almost the entire North American continent and, in fact, all of Europe and all of Asia. There are large poplar planting programs going on right now in China. It's the largest planting effort in history and it's known as the Green Wall of China, and I can't tell you the number of acres, but it's a tremendous amount of poplar planting. It's all over the world, and so it's well adapted to many, many different sites. It's being deployed as hybrids of alternate species depending on what part of the world you're in. FLATOW: One interesting aspect of this research that caught my attention was that the poplar trees can also be used for carbon sequestration. Tell us about what you can do with that and what that means. Dr. TUSKAN: What we were able to discover once we sequenced and annotated the genome was that the biochemical pathway for cell wall biosynthesis above ground is different or independent of the biochemical pathway for cell wall biosynthesis below ground. So if we want to maximize the amount of ethanol per unit of area of land above ground we would favor cellulose and hemicellulose. Below ground, if we want to increase the sequestration potential of the plant, we would favor lignant. So we believe that we can independently change the chemistry above and below ground and get biofuels from harvested portions above ground, and at the same time sequester carbon in long-term pools, such as lignant, in root systems below ground. FLATOW: So when the plant breathes in carbon dioxide, it would be stored more efficiently in the root system? Dr. TUSKAN: That's correct. For carbon sequestration you'd like that carbon, the CO2 that comes in to the plant through photosynthesis, to ultimately be stored in the form of lignant below ground. FLATOW: So it's like two different plants you have going. Dr. TUSKAN: It is like two different plants. It's one organism, one genotype, but we will upregulate cellulose biosynthesis above ground and then favor lignant biosynthesis below ground. And we didn't know that that was possible until we had sequenced the genome and annotated the biochemical pathways above and below ground and came to realize that there are independent genes that control the expression of cell walls above and below ground. FLATOW: It sounds, Dr. Tuskan, just too good to be true. Dr. TUSKAN: Well, it's true enough in the lab. We're in the process of trying to validate it in field conditions and continue to explore the improvement of cell walls above and below ground. So we'll see. I think in five years we'll have validated field trials. And if the validation holds up, I think in ten years we'll see domesticated poplar plantations producing energy out on the landscape. FLATOW: That's great. We'll have to look forward to it. Thank you for taking time to talk with us. Dr. TUSKAN: You're welcome. Thank you very much. FLATOW: Good luck to you.

We're going to put those questions and others now to Dr. Patricia Griffin, who is acting chief of the Enteric Diseases Epidemiology Branch of the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta. And enteric diseases means E. coli is your beat. Dr. PATRICIA GRIFFIN (Centers for Disease Control): That's right. SIEGEL: How common is E. coli? Dr. GRIFFIN: Well, we estimate that back in 1999 that there were about 73,000 E. coli cases in the United States every year. We've been fortunate in that the number has been decreasing over the past few years, but we still investigate about 25 E. coli 0157 outbreaks every year. SIEGEL: We're talking about an outbreak here that's in the low triple digits. Dr. GRIFFIN: That's right. SIEGEL: Why are we hearing so much about it, then, if there are so many cases of E. coli? Dr. GRIFFIN: Well a lot of the cases are sporadic, meaning they're not linked with each other and the source of the illness is not found. So whenever we find an outbreak - and that means two or more people with the same strain due to the same source - we try to find out that source so that we can remove it from the marketplace and figure out how it got contaminated so that we can prevent that from happening in the future. SIEGEL: And when you find yourself in that situation, doing such an investigation, how common is that each year say? Dr. GRIFFIN: We have about 25 of them in the United States every year. SIEGEL: Twenty-five a year. In terms of how - I know I'm medically misusing the term, but how virulent this particular strain is, how bad is it? Dr. GRIFFIN: E. coli 0157 in general is a very virulent bacteria. You'd need only a few organisms to make you very sick and there's no specific treatment. There's no treatment that you can give that will make the illness go away. SIEGEL: To what do you and others at the Centers for Disease Control attribute what you say has been a general decline over the past several years in the number of E. coli outbreaks? Dr. GRIFFIN: We don't know why they've declined. Some of the possible reasons are that the fast food industry has learned to cook hamburgers very well, even though ground beef can still be contaminated with this organism. And in the past few years, the ground beef industry has worked very hard to decrease the amount of ground beef that's contaminated with E. coli 0157, and so we think that the ground beef in supermarkets is safer than it used to be. But that's still an important source of infections and it's still very important to cook your hamburgers very well. SIEGEL: If somebody has no symptoms right now of anything but knows that they had a spinach salad two days ago, what should they do? Dr. GRIFFIN: They should relax and not do anything. Except if they have that spinach still in their refrigerator, they should throw it away. SIEGEL: And that would go for any spinach that anyone in the United States today has in the refrigerator? Dr. GRIFFIN: Any raw spinach. Now if that person develops diarrhea, they should see their healthcare provider right away and get that spinach bag out of the trash and arrange to send it to the health department.

I'm Robert Siegel. The California produce company that has been linked to the nationwide E. coli outbreak is now at odds with the Food and Drug Administration. Natural Selection Foods has said its organic spinach has been ruled out as the source of outbreak. Government health inspectors dispute that claim, saying that nothing has been ruled out yet. Coming up, we'll talk about the dangers of E. coli with an epidemiologist at the Centers for Disease Control. First, NPR's John McChesney reports on the impact on the organic produce industry. JOHN McCHESNEY: Natural Selection Foods is the nation's largest organic produce shipper but it's also a major packager of conventionally grown produce. It's still unclear which of the company's crops has been linked to the E. coli outbreak. Meanwhile, at the farmer's market in Marin County, California, shoppers are still buying fresh spinach with abandon, not from big companies like Natural Selection but from small, trusted growers. Morty Luscow(ph) is dipping a bin of emerald green leaves. He says he doesn't buy the packaged stuff. Mr. MORTY LUSCOW: No, I generally buy fresh here at the Farmer's Market. McCHESNEY: So it doesn't worry you at all. Mr. LUSCOW: No. I'm not worried. I'm fine. McCHESNEY: You've heard the story? Mr. LUSCOW: I've heard all the stories. I know all about it, and I asked them and they said it was fine so I trust them. McCHESNEY: Warren Weber is the owner of Star Route Farms. He's considered the father of the organic industry in California. Weber says when you get as big as Natural Selection Foods, with 150 farms supplying fresh spinach, tracing an outbreak can be a problem. Mr. WARREN WEBER (Star Route Farms): See if we have a problem, it could be isolated and we can find out and fix it right away. This bigger thing where you have these mega corporations, you know, doing conventional and organic and putting it in bags and shipping it all over the world, I mean, the chain there of authority is, you know, is difficult. McCHESNEY: Critics of organic foods have often charged that in spite of its claims, the organic industry's produce is no safer than vegetables grown with chemicals and pesticides. But supporters of organic farming insist that this E. coli outbreak in no way indicts the organic industry, even if it should turn out that Natural Selections' organic product is the source of the problem. Michael Pollan is the author of books and articles on agriculture. Mr. MICHAEL POLLAN (Agriculture expert): Critics of organic have said well, this proves that organic is unsafe because it's grown with manure. And that's not a very fair charge, actually. Organic food is grown with compost. It's a very well regulated process and the compost has to reach certain temperatures that are set so that they will kill any microbes in the manure. But by the time it's compost, if you've ever worked with compost, it's not manure. It's something else. McCHESNEY: Pollan points out that organic production is regulated while conventional is not. And, he says, conventional farmers also use manure on their crops. Mr. POLLAN: The contrast is usually drawn between an organic agriculture using manure and conventional agriculture using high tech chemicals. But in fact a lot of that fertilizer on the conventional side comes from your local sewage treatment plant. McCHESNEY: Pollan has visited the processing plant at Natural Selection foods and is complimentary about the sanitary measures taken there. But he says the sheer scale of the operation may complicate matters. Mr. POLLAN: Whenever you have one company or one plant putting out 26 million servings of salad at the same time, it is as though, you know, 26 million salads are being washed in the same sink. McCHESNEY: Pollan feels that concentrating the food chain, putting the output of 150 separate farms through one processing plant as happens with Natural Selection Foods, scales up the danger of food poisoning outbreaks. Mr. POLLAN: This is why we have seen over the past few years that the scale of food poisoning outbreaks have changed from, you know, the church social where everybody who ate, you know, Aunt Mabel's potato salad got sick to a situation where 19 states and 110 people are involved, because we've scaled up the way we process our food. McCHESNEY: Back at the Marin County Farmer's Market, shopper Chris Twining(ph) watches her fresh spinach being weighed up on the scales. Are you worried at all about this E. Coli thing? Ms. CHRIS TWINING: I'm not worried about buying it from Star Route Farms or other organic growers in Marin County. McCHESNEY: She says she just tossed out a bag of store bought spinach and now she'll stick to her local growers. John McChesney, NPR News, San Francisco.

I know all about it, and I asked them and they said it was fine so I trust them.  McCHESNEY: Warren Weber is the owner of Star Route Farms. He's considered the father of the organic industry in California. Weber says when you get as big as Natural Selection Foods, with 150 farms supplying fresh spinach, tracing an outbreak can be a problem.  Mr. WARREN WEBER (Star Route Farms): See if we have a problem, it could be isolated and we can find out and fix it right away. This bigger thing where you have these mega corporations, you know, doing conventional and organic and putting it in bags and shipping it all over the world, I mean, the chain there of authority is, you know, is difficult.  McCHESNEY: Critics of organic foods have often charged that in spite of its claims, the organic industry's produce is no safer than vegetables grown with chemicals and pesticides. But supporters of organic farming insist that this E. coli outbreak in no way indicts the organic industry, even if it should turn out that Natural Selections' organic product is the source of the problem.  Michael Pollan is the author of books and articles on agriculture.  Mr. MICHAEL POLLAN (Agriculture expert): Critics of organic have said well, this proves that organic is unsafe because it's grown with manure. And that's not a very fair charge, actually. Organic food is grown with compost. It's a very well regulated process and the compost has to reach certain temperatures that are set so that they will kill any microbes in the manure. But by the time it's compost, if you've ever worked with compost, it's not manure. It's something else.  McCHESNEY: Pollan points out that organic production is regulated while conventional is not. And, he says, conventional farmers also use manure on their crops.  Mr. POLLAN: The contrast is usually drawn between an organic agriculture using manure and conventional agriculture using high tech chemicals. But in fact a lot of that fertilizer on the conventional side comes from your local sewage treatment plant.  McCHESNEY: Pollan has visited the processing plant at Natural Selection foods and is complimentary about the sanitary measures taken there. But he says the sheer scale of the operation may complicate matters.  Mr. POLLAN: Whenever you have one company or one plant putting out 26 million servings of salad at the same time, it is as though, you know, 26 million salads are being washed in the same sink.  McCHESNEY: Pollan feels that concentrating the food chain, putting the output of 150 separate farms through one processing plant as happens with Natural Selection Foods, scales up the danger of food poisoning outbreaks.  Mr. POLLAN: This is why we have seen over the past few years that the scale of food poisoning outbreaks have changed from, you know, the church social where everybody who ate, you know, Aunt Mabel's potato salad got sick to a situation where 19 states and 110 people are involved, because we've scaled up the way we process our food.  McCHESNEY: Back at the Marin County Farmer's Market, shopper Chris Twining(ph) watches her fresh spinach being weighed up on the scales.  Are you worried at all about this E. Coli thing?  Ms. CHRIS TWINING: I'm not worried about buying it from Star Route Farms or other organic growers in Marin County.  McCHESNEY: She says she just tossed out a bag of store bought spinach and now she'll stick to her local growers.  John McChesney, NPR News, San Francisco.

The report calls for universities to undertake immediate, far-reaching reforms now to try to stamp out the bias. Joining me talk about it is Maria Zuber. You've heard her here before talking about Mars and planetary missions. She's a member of the National Academies' Committee on Maximizing the Potential of Women in Academic Science and Engineering, in addition to being professor of geophysics and the head of the department of Earth, atmospheric and planetary sciences at MIT. Welcome back to SCIENCE FRIDAY, Dr. Zuber. Dr. MARIA ZUBER (Member, National Academies' Committee on Maximizing the Potential of Women in Academic Science and Engineering): It's great to be back. FLATOW: Was this report - did it confirm what we already know or did it say we're making progress in this area? Dr. ZUBER: Well, depending on what aspect of it you look at. In terms of the findings I would say there was one general finding that confirmed what most of us thought we knew and one that was quite a surprise. The confirmation was don't blame biology. We went through, we looked at all of the literature on biological differences: brain structure, hormones, cognitive development, even evolution. And for sure, there are differences between women and men. However, these differences absolutely cannot account for the lower representation of women on academic faculty and in leadership positions. FLATOW: The Larry Summers factor here. Dr. ZUBER: The Larry Summers factor. Well, Larry challenged this question to be looked at, and it has now been looked at and the answer is resoundingly clear. And we have a full chapter in the report that details all the literature, and the data is there and people can now go look for themselves. And so we can now put this question to bed. FLATOW: And the other part of the report, talking about the work that still has yet to be done. Dr. ZUBER: Well, let's see. I should finish up with the finding that was a surprise, okay? FLATOW: Oh, yes, absolutely. Dr. ZUBER: The surprise to many of us was don't blame the pipeline, okay? I think many of us expected the answer to be that there just isn't a large enough pool of available, trained women who were ready and willing and able to go into these faculty positions. But in fact that wasn't the case. We all wish that there were more women in the pool, but given the amount of women who are getting PhDs and who've indicated an intention that they were interested in academia, the number that we're seeing who actually get appointments in academic science and engineering is inconsistent with what the available pool is in most fields. So the talent is there and the interest is there, okay? So then the question becomes, which was your next question, what do we do about it? Well, if we all agree that there's a disparity, then there are two issues that we have to concern ourselves with. And first of all, is making appointments of women into these positions, and then the next one is keeping them there. Now in terms of making appointments, we looked at this matter; and the representation of the committee, you know, ranged from people who were college presidents all the way down to people who were department heads like myself, where the actual hiring occurs. And we talked to an awful lot of people about this, and the tendency in academia is we all think we're being fair and we all want to be excellent. But when we're judging excellence we tend to stay close to shore, and it's easier for us to recognize excellence if it looks like ourselves, okay? So there's a tendency when you interview candidates - where's the fit? You try to envision what is good research and what is the best research and how would this person fit in our department. It's very easy to see former post-docs and graduate students, and it's very easy to see people who look like you and who act like you fitting into these positions easier. And so the challenge is to sort of put aside these biases. And the biases exist in women as well as men, okay? And to just do as much as we can to broaden the pool so that we're judging not on how a person looks like they're going to fit but in terms of where the real talent is, okay? FLATOW: There's also mention made of what concrete things universities can do. For example, journals should be thinking about submitting articles to reviewers without the names or the identities attached. Dr. ZUBER: Well, that was one of the things that we had thought of. You know, when you send out a paper for review, and I'm as guilty about this as the next person. When I get papers to review from certain people in the community I say okay, well, I have a bias before I even read it that this is a good paper if I know that it's a well-respected researcher. But then, you know, then perhaps that makes somebody who's an unknown that we're not giving them the benefit of the doubt that we would give a more senior person. And granted, people have worked hard to get these reputations, but when you're dealing with journals where, you know, in Science and Nature where they only send maybe one out of 20 submitted papers out for review, you know, it's possible that we could be giving a fairer shake to everybody, to junior women and to junior men, if we did not only the reviewing blindly but if we actually masked the names of the people who wrote the papers. Then we'd have to read the full paper before we developed an opinion of what the quality of the work was. FLATOW: Talking with Maria Zuber on TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. Dr. Zuber, what about - you mentioned that somewhere in the pipeline we're losing women. Is there any intervention at any place that you found might work? Dr. ZUBER: Well, we're losing women at all stages of the pipeline, okay? And I guess the good news is that things are starting to get better on the high school end, okay? Women are now doing as well as men are in math in high school, so there's, you know, a population of people there who are doing well and who are competitive. And so when you go into the undergraduate part of the curriculum - now at MIT, half of the undergraduate science majors are women and 35 percent of the undergraduate engineering majors are women. So then you go into graduate school, and the numbers get a little bit less. And then women tend to get - you lose women at different parts of the system, and we really need to take efforts to try to understand why we're losing them. Now in terms of, you know, if you find a women, you appoint a woman, how do you not lose a woman in the tenure-track process? Well, it turns out that the system that we have in academia now is set up so that in the time when you're fighting to try to get tenure at a university, these are also the prime childbearing years for women, okay? And so there's a problem there. You know, we all realize that if we're going to have a position in academia, that we have to work very hard. But the time that you have to work the hardest are your prime childbearing years. So we looked into this, and it turns out that doing things like, you know, providing, you know - suppose we allowed research grants to allow small allowance for child care while a person attends a scientific meeting or that allowed, say, child care or technician support while a person - while a woman went on maternity leave. These are little things. They certainly would have some cost associated with them, but they would be things where it would say, well, you're not working any less hard, but you're helping with the support structure. It turns out that one of the real impediments in terms of succeeding in academic is what I will call the lack of a traditional stay-at-home wife. And now 90 percent of the junior academic women have spouses. Half of the men who are in academic positions have working wives. So we're in a situation that, you know, anything that we could do to help with either elder care or child care support, it would not only help the women but it would help junior faculty men too. So it turns out that if you really look at the situation, challenges that affect women also tend to affect men to a somewhat lesser extent. So, you know, a number of the things that we're talking about undertaking in terms of steps to make things better are going to make it easier for everybody to succeed. FLATOW: Do you think these will be written down somewhere so that people actually take up this advice? I mean will the changes happen? Dr. ZUBER: Well, the changes have to occur at various levels. They have to occur within universities. We're calling on professional societies also to pitch in and do their part. You know, when a junior person is trying to establish themselves in their careers, the ability to get an invitation to give an invited talk at a conference is an important thing. So we're calling on societies to, you know, look at the - to really examine the pool so that they make their best effort to have gender balance to the extent there can be in terms of invited talks. We think that, you know, perhaps the best way to make progress on this is for academia to police itself. So we've actually on the committee come up with a draft of a scorecard for how we're doing in terms of engaging women in the academic process. FLATOW: Dr. Zuber, we've run out of time. Dr. ZUBER: Okay. FLATOW: I want to thank you, though. We'll pick this up in the longer format that it deserves. I want to thank you for taking time to be with us. Dr. ZUBER: Well that would be great. Thank you. FLATOW: You're welcome. Maria Zuber, member of the National Academies' Committee on Maximizing the Potential of Women in Academic Science and Engineering.

I'm Liane Hansen. Federal officials now say that it's safe to eat spinach not grown in California's Salinas Valley. The recent E. coli outbreak across the United States has been blamed on contaminated bagged and pre-washed spinach. Most consumers have heard of E. coli, but usually in connection with infected meat; the 1993 E. coli outbreak at fast food chain Jack in the Box, for example. Improved inspection of meat processing and packaging facilities have helped avoid further problems, but inspection of fresh produce has not received the same attention.  Joining us from Chicago is Caroline Smith DeWaal, director of Food Safety at the Center for Science in the Public Interest. Welcome to the show, Caroline. Ms. CAROLINE SMITH DEWAAL (Director, Food Safety, Center for Science in the Public Interest): Good morning, Liane. HANSEN: So in general, how does produce inspection differ from that of meat and poultry? Ms. DEWAAL: Well, meat and poultry is regulated by the U. S. Department of Agriculture. And under a 1906 law, they are required to go into meat plants every day. They inspect them every single day. And if it's a slaughter plant, they inspect it constantly. They look at every single carcass. HANSEN: And what about produce? Who. . .  Ms. DEWAAL: Well, produce is one of the many foods which is regulated by our Food and Drug Administration. So it's done by a totally different agency that's actually in an entirely separate department. But FDA's law, which also originated in 1906, doesn't have the same intensive inspection regime. And as a result, FDA has really suffered. They don't have the kind of inspection force that USDA does.  And so when it gets down to the farm level, FDA rarely visits a farm unless there is an actual outbreak going on. So they end up like a fire department, running around looking for outbreaks, stopping them, you know, sending the scientist out to the fields, which they're doing right now. They, you know, they have - they're a great fire department. They can go out after the fact and try to put out the fire. But what they're not doing is preventing the fires from starting to begin with. HANSEN: Should - what sort of systems then are in place to deal with these produce contamination issues should they arise? Ms. DEWAAL: Well, the - first of all, FDA and CDC have been aware of the problem with produce for a number of years. And we've been watching this trend of growing outbreaks linked to fresh fruits, vegetables, salads, other dishes containing vegetables. We've been watching this for about five years, and our data is from the government. So we know the government is seeing the exact same data.  Now, FDA, back in the - probably the late 1990s - issued guidance for the produce growers. They said, gosh, you need to be using safe handling of manure products. You need to be using good water in production and have basic sanitation facilities for your workers. So they put out these guidance to the industry, but the guidance are unenforceable. And I think it's because FDA just doesn't have the resources to do the job here. HANSEN: Are the guidelines that they sent out voluntary? Ms. DEWAAL: Yes. HANSEN: Ah. Ms. DEWAAL: They're completely voluntary, both for the domestic industry and for imported produce. And we get a lot of imported produce these days. HANSEN: What do you think is the solution to prevent further contaminations of produce? Ms. DEWAAL: Well, I think that we need - the industry needs to take the problem very seriously, because the industry is the first line of defense to preventing this. And in many cases, like in the meat area, where we had problems with E. coli-015787 in ground beef, the beef industry ultimately ended up really addressing that problem by test-and-hold programs in ground beef and some other programs that they came up with themselves. But they only did it after the government said you've got to do this. HANSEN: Is government regulation possible, even if no one knows what the source of this contamination is? Ms. DEWAAL: Well, what we do know is, there is some common sense things that the growers have to do to ensure the safety, to maximize the safety of the products they're producing. It's simple things. It's things like not using raw manure, using mostly composted manure, making sure your composting is working correctly. You also need water control over your water sources, both for irrigation and for the washing process. And then critically important, the farm workers need sanitation facilities close to where the fields are. And they need hand-washing facilities - that's vital. These people are actually harvesting the food we're going to eat.  So those are simple steps. And yes, the government, FDA could mandate those. The question is, once they mandate it, how will they check it? They don't have the staff today to do it.  HANSEN: Caroline Smith DeWaal is the director of the food safety program at the Center for Science in the Public Interest.  Thank you so much for your time. Ms. DEWAAL: Thank you.

They, you know, they have - they're a great fire department. They can go out after the fact and try to put out the fire. But what they're not doing is preventing the fires from starting to begin with.  HANSEN: Should - what sort of systems then are in place to deal with these produce contamination issues should they arise?  Ms. DEWAAL: Well, the - first of all, FDA and CDC have been aware of the problem with produce for a number of years. And we've been watching this trend of growing outbreaks linked to fresh fruits, vegetables, salads, other dishes containing vegetables. We've been watching this for about five years, and our data is from the government. So we know the government is seeing the exact same data.   Now, FDA, back in the - probably the late 1990s - issued guidance for the produce growers. They said, gosh, you need to be using safe handling of manure products. You need to be using good water in production and have basic sanitation facilities for your workers. So they put out these guidance to the industry, but the guidance are unenforceable. And I think it's because FDA just doesn't have the resources to do the job here.  HANSEN: Are the guidelines that they sent out voluntary?  Ms. DEWAAL: Yes.  HANSEN: Ah.  Ms. DEWAAL: They're completely voluntary, both for the domestic industry and for imported produce. And we get a lot of imported produce these days.  HANSEN: What do you think is the solution to prevent further contaminations of produce?  Ms. DEWAAL: Well, I think that we need - the industry needs to take the problem very seriously, because the industry is the first line of defense to preventing this. And in many cases, like in the meat area, where we had problems with E. coli-015787 in ground beef, the beef industry ultimately ended up really addressing that problem by test-and-hold programs in ground beef and some other programs that they came up with themselves. But they only did it after the government said you've got to do this.  HANSEN: Is government regulation possible, even if no one knows what the source of this contamination is?  Ms. DEWAAL: Well, what we do know is, there is some common sense things that the growers have to do to ensure the safety, to maximize the safety of the products they're producing. It's simple things. It's things like not using raw manure, using mostly composted manure, making sure your composting is working correctly. You also need water control over your water sources, both for irrigation and for the washing process. And then critically important, the farm workers need sanitation facilities close to where the fields are. And they need hand-washing facilities - that's vital. These people are actually harvesting the food we're going to eat.   So those are simple steps. And yes, the government, FDA could mandate those. The question is, once they mandate it, how will they check it? They don't have the staff today to do it.   HANSEN: Caroline Smith DeWaal is the director of the food safety program at the Center for Science in the Public Interest.   Thank you so much for your time.  Ms. DEWAAL: Thank you.

She was taken to the Clearwater Marine Aquarium and they're hoping to design a new tail for the young dolphin, whom they've named Winter. Dana Zucker is chief operating officer with the aquarium and why don't you explain what kind of shape Winter was when she first came to the aquarium. Ms. DANA ZUCKER (Clearwater Marine Aquarium): When we first actually received the call that she was actually coming to us and then when she got here we really didn't think she was going to make it. She was very young, very small, a dependent calf and had wounds that were just beyond our imagination. Rope lines wrapped around her mouth and then it was so tight around her tail that the circulation stopped for a long period of time, causing the tail to slowly self amputate. BLOCK: Well how were you able to get her healthy again? Ms. ZUCKER: Lots of loving care, lots of volunteers 24/7 for about four months came in on four people/four hour shifts feeding her in the middle of night in cold wetsuits outside. BLOCK: Now she is able to swim even without her tail. Ms. ZUCKER: Yeah actually within the first few years that she was here she was swimming. She uses her flippers almost as little paddles sometimes and she moves her body from side to side rather than moving the tail stub up and down. She really wiggles it back and forth and she moves like a bullet. She is fast and she dives. She's really amazing. BLOCK: So why do you think she needs a tail? She looks like she is doing okay. I was looking at pictures and she looks pretty happy. I guess all dolphins look happy, but she looks like she's having a good time. Ms. ZUCKER: She does, she looks like she's having a good time. She has no signs of stress. Our concern and the concern of the experts in the field feel as though we need to carefully monitor her because a dolphin does move up and down and we don't want to cause any spinal injury. And if we can get a tail that can go on for short amount of times during the day so that she can exercise her spine in the right way, it's going to create a dolphin who's going to be able to speak out for dolphins everywhere and keep dolphins wild because (unintelligible) line and crab traps are a big issue and a big killer of dolphins. BLOCK: Well let's talk about this prosthetic tail that you'd like her to have. Have they ever done something like this before? Ms. ZUCKER: There's only been one other case of a dolphin with a prosthetic tail that we know about, and that's Fuji, (unintelligible) Fuji, but he has a good portion of his tail left so they can fit something over his stump. Winter has an unusual thing because she's missing part of her peduncle, part of her stump, so we need to make something that can actually fit over there, almost like a wet suit so that she can exercise in the up and down motion. So people do feel that we can do it. BLOCK: So how much would it cost? Ms. ZUCKER: We don't know how much it would cost. We do know that Fuji's about four years ago cost $100,000. The thing that's different with Winter is that she'll need many tails. She'll need at least five tails over the course of her life. She's less than a year old. She'll be a year next month, and they don't become full grown until they're about 15 years old. So we'll have to get her bigger tails as she grows. BLOCK: And no matter what you end up doing with Winter, Winter is staying in the aquarium. There's no way Winter can go back to the wild.

Coli in the tainted spinach: E. Coli 0157 H7. Even though it's not clear how it got in the spinach, one possible source is cattle waste. It could have come from contaminated irrigation water used to grow the spinach. Researchers say they're closing in on a new approach to protecting the public from E. Coli with a vaccine given to cattle instead of humans. From Nebraska Public Radio, Sarah McCammon reports. SARAH MCCAMMON: Past outbreaks of E. Coli related illnesses have come from tainted beef, which can become contaminated during processing. Cattle can tolerate the bacteria with no problems, but in humans this type of E. Coli can cause severe illness or even death. At a University of Nebraska research feed lot near Lincoln, several hundred cattle are part of a clinical trial aimed at fine tuning a Canadian vaccine for E. Coli: 0157. A team of mostly graduate students works on the messy job of collecting samples of the animals' blood and manure. Feedlot specialist Galen Ericson explains how the process works. Mr. GALEN ERICSON (University of Nebraska): We've run them through what they call a crowd shoot where the cattle actually come in in a group of eight to ten. MCCAMMON: The trials began in 2002 and researchers have since tested some 25,000 head of cattle from across Nebraska. Results of earlier tests were published in the journal Vaccine in 2004. Epidemiologist David Smith says the vaccine reduces the number of animals with E. coli bacteria in their manure by 60 percent to 70 percent. Coupled with what people in the industry call interventions, safety practices like washing hides and carcasses after slaughter, Smith says the vaccine could significantly reduce the risk of contamination to the food supply. Dr. DAVID SMITH (Epidemiologist): There may still be organisms coming into the plant - we're not eliminating it - but at a much lower level so that the interventions that take place post-harvest have an opportunity to be effective. They don't get overwhelmed. MCCAMMON: Back in Lincoln at a university laboratory, technicians prepare manure samples for analysis. Veterinary science professor Rod Moxley says they use a technique that helps them hone in on E. coli: 0157. Dr. ROD MOXLEY (University of Nebraska): There are nutrients in there to make the bacteria grow. There's also other substances in there that are selective for the bacteria. They will kill out competing organisms. MCCAMMON: Funding for the research comes from several sources, including the U. S. Department of Agriculture, the cattle industry and the Ontario-based biotechnology company Bioniche Life Sciences. President and CEO Graeme McRae says so far the company has invested roughly $15 million in research and development and will spend at least $50 million more to get the product on the market. But McRae says he believes the E. coli vaccine will catch on with the industry and turn a profit in three to four years. Mr. GRAEME MCRAE (Bioniche Life Sciences): One feedlot called and said we process a million animals at a time. You know, how are you going to have enough vaccine for us to put it in the system? MCCAMMON: McRae says the treatment likely will cost $6 to $8 per animal. He says he hopes to see every herd of cattle in North America receive the vaccine. But animal science professor Terry Klopfenstein, a member of the Nebraska research team, says turning the vaccine into a viable product for producers may be a challenge, at least at first. Dr. TERRY KLOPFENSTEIN (University of Nebraska): For them, what's the economic benefit to vaccinating their cattle? There is no direct benefit because the cattle will not gain faster. They'll not do it more efficiently. The meat won't taste any better. MCCAMMON: Still, Klopfenstein says he thinks the vaccine would ultimately benefit producers by making beef safer and helping shore up public confidence in the industry. Dr. KLOPFENSTEIN: It's of benefit to the industry to be reducing the risk of either the meat or where that manure may end up. MCCAMMON: Researchers expect to finish their current trial this fall and complete their analysis of the data by the end of the year.

This plant is a parasitic vine that has a remarkable ability to sniff out its victim. NPR's David Malakoff reports. DAVID MALAKOFF: The vine is called dodder. Among farmers it has a nasty reputation for damaging crops. In fact, they've put dodder on a kind of a ten most wanted list of weeds. And like many dangerous characters, dodder has some colorful aliases - Strangle Weed, Devil Guts, Witch's Shoelaces. Professor COLIN PURRINGTON (Swarthmore College): Dodder is probably one of the creepiest plants I know of. MALAKOFF: Colin Purrington is a dodder expert at Swarthmore College in Pennsylvania. He says the vine starts out as just a tiny tendril. No roots, no leaves, and the seedling has just a week or so to find a host plant it can wrap around. Then like a vampire, the dodder sinks some fleshy fangs into its victim and starts drinking. Professor PURRINGTON: It's a horrible existence for the host plant. If plants could scream, they'd have the loudest screams when they had dodder attached. MALAKOFF: Exactly how dodder hones in on its victims has been a bit of a mystery. The vine might be attracted to water vapor or maybe the light that reflects off a potential host. But three researchers at Pennsylvania State University wondered if dodder was following the scent of its victim. And as it turns out, they were right. Consuelo De Moraes was on the team. She says when they wafted, say, eau de tomato in the direction of a dodder seedling, the tendril almost always began to creep toward the smell. Ms. CONSUELO DE MORAES (Pennsylvania State University): It's really amazing to watch this plant having this almost animal-like behavior. It's really very sophisticated and surprising. MALAKOFF: The study also showed that dodder likes some plants more than others. Give it a choice of tomato or wheat and the vine usually goes for the tomato. That may be because the wheat gives off a chemical that repels the vine. Mark Mescher, another Penn State scientist who worked on the study, says that could be good news for farmers. Mr. MARK MESCHER (Pennsylvania State University): The fact that there are these repellant compounds suggest that you might be able to create a repellant or a deterrent effect that would allow you to protect an agricultural crop against infestation.

I'm Debbie Elliott. Elephants are revered in some countries, but in parts of Africa and Asia they're viewed as giant, scary pests that destroy crops. Electric fences can keep wild elephants away, but they can be expensive to maintain. So for years, farmers have been looking for a quicker, cheaper answer, and they may have found it growing right underneath their noses. NPR's John Nielsen has more. JOHN NIELSEN reporting: Here's a tip for everybody who's trying to keep pachyderms out of their backyards. Elephants everywhere absolutely hate red-hot chili peppers. (Soundbite of song \"Give It Away\") THE RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS (Rock Band): (Singing) Oh, give it away, give it away, give it away now. Give it away, give it away, give it away now. NIELSEN: No, not the band. The real thing: peppers people grow in gardens found all over the world; peppers that inspire hot sauces with names like Mega Death and Mad Dog 357; peppers that make your nose and throat feel like they just burst into flames. It turns out that elephants have a similar reaction to these peppers. Give them but a whiff and they will dance around like cartoon characters, so says Loki Osborn of the nonprofit Elephant Pepper Development Trust. Mr. LOKI OSBORN (Elephant Pepper Development Trust): They flair out their ears, shake their head back and forth, a lot of strong exhalation of air - (makes blowing sound) - you know, and sometimes like high-pitched trumpeting, which makes most of the farmers laugh a lot because they know exactly what the elephant's feeling. NIELSEN: The Trust, based in South Africa, has been promoting the use of red-hot peppers as a low-tech way to drive hungry elephants away from farm fields. Osborn says it works in part because while we humans have mere noses on our faces, elephants have giant trunks that are incredibly sensitive to capsaicin, the chemical that makes peppers hot. Mr. OSBORN: Their whole trunk is coated with a mucus membrane, and elephants have 100 or 200 times better sense of smell than humans. So when they breathe in even very, very small amounts of atomized capsaicin that you get when you burn a chili, for example, their whole trunk is stimulated. NIELSEN: Osborn started stimulating elephant trunks in the late 1990s after hearing stories about farmers using peppers in the old days. Since then he's taught hundreds of farmers to plant hot chili pepper buffer zones around their fields and to create what he calls dung bombs out of ground-up peppers and dry elephant poop. When these bombs are burned, they send out spicy smoke that helps drive big groups of elephants away for hours at a time. Mr. OSBORN: In some cases you have 50 or 60 animals visiting a field from 6:00 p. m. till 3:00 a. m. NIELSEN: Scientists don't really know how well the red-hot chili pepper defense is working just yet, and some of them worry that elephants driven off the peppered fields just end up on other farms. But in southern Africa, the program is a hit, with farmers lining up to get involved in it. Pilot pepper programs are now up and running in Cambodia and Thailand, too. And if the thought of putting all those elephants through all that pain seems a bit cruel to you, Osborn advises you to think a bit about the alternatives. For poor framers, they consist of waiting in farm fields in the middle of the night with a lot of pots and pans on which they are forced to bang when they see elephants approaching. Some of these farmers end up getting stomped to death, says Osborn. Most of the rest accomplish nothing in the end. Mr. OSBORN: And these animals would charge them and chase them around the fields and scare the farmers quite a bit. And usually what they do is abandon all of their fields to the animals, and the animals would end up just consuming virtually everything. NIELSEN: Farmers who lose everything to animals like these will look the other way when poachers come around. In that sense the plan B faced by many of the elephants might just be a bullet through the forehead. John Nielsen, NPR News, Washington.

The real thing: peppers people grow in gardens found all over the world; peppers that inspire hot sauces with names like Mega Death and Mad Dog 357; peppers that make your nose and throat feel like they just burst into flames.  It turns out that elephants have a similar reaction to these peppers. Give them but a whiff and they will dance around like cartoon characters, so says Loki Osborn of the nonprofit Elephant Pepper Development Trust.  Mr. LOKI OSBORN (Elephant Pepper Development Trust): They flair out their ears, shake their head back and forth, a lot of strong exhalation of air - (makes blowing sound) - you know, and sometimes like high-pitched trumpeting, which makes most of the farmers laugh a lot because they know exactly what the elephant's feeling.  NIELSEN: The Trust, based in South Africa, has been promoting the use of red-hot peppers as a low-tech way to drive hungry elephants away from farm fields. Osborn says it works in part because while we humans have mere noses on our faces, elephants have giant trunks that are incredibly sensitive to capsaicin, the chemical that makes peppers hot.  Mr. OSBORN: Their whole trunk is coated with a mucus membrane, and elephants have 100 or 200 times better sense of smell than humans. So when they breathe in even very, very small amounts of atomized capsaicin that you get when you burn a chili, for example, their whole trunk is stimulated.  NIELSEN: Osborn started stimulating elephant trunks in the late 1990s after hearing stories about farmers using peppers in the old days. Since then he's taught hundreds of farmers to plant hot chili pepper buffer zones around their fields and to create what he calls dung bombs out of ground-up peppers and dry elephant poop. When these bombs are burned, they send out spicy smoke that helps drive big groups of elephants away for hours at a time.  Mr. OSBORN: In some cases you have 50 or 60 animals visiting a field from 6:00 p. m. till 3:00 a. m.  NIELSEN: Scientists don't really know how well the red-hot chili pepper defense is working just yet, and some of them worry that elephants driven off the peppered fields just end up on other farms. But in southern Africa, the program is a hit, with farmers lining up to get involved in it. Pilot pepper programs are now up and running in Cambodia and Thailand, too.  And if the thought of putting all those elephants through all that pain seems a bit cruel to you, Osborn advises you to think a bit about the alternatives. For poor framers, they consist of waiting in farm fields in the middle of the night with a lot of pots and pans on which they are forced to bang when they see elephants approaching. Some of these farmers end up getting stomped to death, says Osborn. Most of the rest accomplish nothing in the end.  Mr. OSBORN: And these animals would charge them and chase them around the fields and scare the farmers quite a bit. And usually what they do is abandon all of their fields to the animals, and the animals would end up just consuming virtually everything.  NIELSEN: Farmers who lose everything to animals like these will look the other way when poachers come around. In that sense the plan B faced by many of the elephants might just be a bullet through the forehead. John Nielsen, NPR News, Washington.

Back in the U. S. , Captain Kuniholm was just not satisfied with his options for a prosthetic device. He's a biomedical engineering student and thought that he could do better. So he and some of his fellow graduate students at North Carolina State started the Open Prosthetics Project to try and do just that. Captain Kuniholm joins us now from Durham, North Carolina, our station there WUNC.  Thanks so much for being with us, Captain. Captain JONATHAN KUNIHOLM (Open Prosthetics Project): It's a pleasure. Thank you. SIMON: And help us understand from the perspective of someone who needs one, what's wrong with or limiting with existing prosthetic devices? Capt. KUNIHOLM: Well, I think that the problem is that the hand is a very complicated thing. And right now there's nothing that solves all of the problems at the same time. So each prosthetic device is good for something and then has drawbacks. For example, body powered devices, which are closed with a rubber band and you pull open with a cable over your shoulder through the motion of your arm, are now either voluntary opening or voluntary closing. And the one thing that I thought would be nice was if you had a device that could be switched between the two. The problem with the voluntary closing devices is that you have to maintain pressure on them to continue to hold onto anything. And if you forget for a second, you drop it.  So you could certainly imagine times when you might want either one of those and you don't want to have to change hands or arms in order to do that. So one that we still only have in the early prototyping stage solves that problem of toggling between voluntary opening and voluntary closing. SIMON: I'm told that you designed one device like a fishing pole? Capt. KUNIHOLM: That was actually a volunteer. Robert Haag is a parent of a child who had a congenital limb deficiency. He was born without his left hand. And he wanted his son to be able to, you know, wind up the fishing pole and go fishing. And so what he did is he modified a Spiderman fishing rod to go on his son's prosthetic arm. But you know, that's sort of the nature of our project here. We wanted not just to publicize our own designs but to invite other people to share their own as well. SIMON: So is the idea of I guess what you call the Open Prosthetics Project that people have in mind exactly what they need in an arm or a leg, what activities are most important to them, and the design follows? Capt. KUNIHOLM: You know, that's the hope. We haven't fully realized that on the current Web site, but our hope is that we could create a community where people could share needs and desires they have and then other people could potentially volunteer to create design ideas to solve those needs. SIMON: I'm intrigued by a quote I've seen attributed to you. You say that your job isn't done until you have a design that's, quote, \"so cool people will want amputation to get one. \" Capt. KUNIHOLM: Well, you know, that's sort of in response to a reaction that I get, particularly if I'm wearing my myoelectric arm. You know, most people haven't seen one of those and when they see it moving around, opening and closing, you know, the first - often the first question I get is, you know, are you controlling that with your brain? And you know, actually the way it works is I'm flexing the muscles that remain in my arm and there are sensors that sit of the surface of the skin and detect that movement and then translate it into motor motion. And yeah, its pretty cool and it's not something that most of us - you know, I had never seen one before, but you know, as good as it is and as impressive as it is, it's a pretty poor replacement to our 24 degree of freedom hand. So its not that cool.  And I guess I think that we can do better. Another project that I'm working on my graduate research at Duke University now, will be working on the new DARPA Revolutionizing Prosthetics 2009 Project. And you know, that program probably will come up with something that compares much more favorably with a human hand and arm.

And if you believe that, there are some people who have a bridge in Brooklyn they'd like to sell you. Two new books argue that string theory, an idea that's united everything in the universe - also called the theory of everything - is just a big ball of yarn. The books are called The Trouble with Physics: The Rise of String Theory, the Fall of Science and What Comes Next by Lee Smolin; and Not Even Wrong: The Failure of String Theory and the Search for Unity in Physical Law by Peter Woit.  Both books are provoking a bit of a row in the physics world. And to explain what that row is all about is our math guy, Keith Devlin, who joins us from Stanford University. Thanks very much for being us. Professor KEITH DEVLIN (Stanford University): Hi, Scott, nice to be here.  SIMON: Now, Keith, first of all, of course what we need is a short, clear, concise, yet all-embracing and comprehensive definition of string theory. Let me get my watch here. I'm going to give you 20 seconds, okay? Three, two, one. (Soundbite of laughter)  Prof. DEVLIN: Actually, Scott, you just gave it. String theorists believe that everything in the universe is ultimately made up of tiny little vibrating strings. The idea began in the 1960s, really took off in the '80s, and it was a reaction to some problems that had arisen with the particle view of matter. It wasn't particularly elegant. There were some mathematical difficulties. And it was that unease that really led to string theory being put forward as an alternative.  SIMON: Oh, I think we still have a little time left. That's why I was (unintelligible). Why is it so hard to prove or disprove string theory? Prof. DEVLIN: We're at a scale here that's so small that no existing equipment, and no equipment we can ever imagine with our foreseeable future, could see that degree of granularity. We just couldn't see things that small. We've got no way of telling whether matter is ultimately made of particles or strings. SIMON: I guess I can understand why you can't test it well enough to prove it, because the resources involved would just be so great. But why can't you come up with a test that would disprove it? Prof. DEVLIN: Well, we don't know you can't do that, but certainly, even after 30 years of trying to think of one, no physicist has yet come up with a test that could conceivably tell the difference. I mean, you have to find - since the strings are too small to conceivably be identified in any way, you have to find some effects that would show the difference. You'd need some experiment which would show whether or not matter was made of strings or particles. And we have no such experiment. No one has been able to come up with anything.  String theory certainly makes predictions, but it doesn't make any predictions which are different from the predictions that come from classical physics. And so we don't have any possible experiments on the horizon that could tell one theory from the other theory. And since the particle view of physics has been tested by experiment and is accepted, the critics of string theory say string theory still remains outside the realms of science because it has yet come up with a means of justifying itself. SIMON: I've been fortunate enough to interview a couple of string theorists, if I might call them that, over the years. They say that just the intellectual exploration to find out whether it's true or not, or what it is, or the intellectual adventure, in a sense, is worth it.  Prof. DEVLIN: Yeah. This is great stuff. This is a great intellectual activity. It's the kind of things universities should be doing. I'm a mathematician, for heaven's sake. I do a lot of pure mathematics, which have never even claimed is necessarily related to things in the real world.  The issue here, however, is whether what they're doing classifies as science. Is it great mathematics? You bet your life it's great mathematics. Does it justify as being mentioned in the history books of mathematics? You bet your life it does. Will string theory eventually make it into the history books of science rather the history books of mathematics? That's a more interesting question. It's not clear it will survive as a science. What is clear is it will survive as a great piece of mathematical exploration.  SIMON: Keith, thanks very much.  Prof. DEVLIN: Okay, my pleasure, Scott.

His most recent book is called The Math Instinct: Why You're a Mathematical Genius Along with Lobsters, Birds, Cats and Dogs.  Dogs believe in string theory? Or is that a generalization?

John Mather and George Smoot were instrumental in building a satellite that measured ancient radiation left over from the creation of the universe. The measurements confirm the Big Bang theory and helped explain why galaxies cluster together in outer space. Joining us now to discuss the prize is NPR's David Kestenbaum. Good morning. DAVID KESTENBAUM: Good morning. AMOS: David, what was this spacecraft that helped win these two men the prize? KESTENBAUM: It was nicknamed COBE, which stood for the Cosmic Background Explorer. And it was actually an idea from the early '70s, and it was supposed to be launched on one of the space shuttles. But that was delayed by the Challenger disaster in 1986. And eventually, they had to launch it on a rocket in 1989. John Mather at Goddard Space Flight Center, one of the winners, is described as the true driving force behind the collaboration, which was over 1,000 people. And George Smoot, who's at the University of California Berkeley, was in charge of one of the instruments onboard. AMOS: And so what did they find? KESTENBAUM: They were studying very precisely the afterglow of the Big Bang. So this is radiation that was produced as part of the Big Bang and still around today. And it's getting cooler and cooler. And this - so it's billions of years old. And it really provided strong evidence that the Big Bang really happened, and it's the best description for what happened at the beginning of the universe because it was the only theory that could explain the precise pattern of radiation that they saw. And literally, when they presented the results at a conference after they were published in 1992, they got a standing ovation. And the experiment also looked for hot and cold spots in the radiation in different parts of the sky, and they found them. And that is seen as evidence for why we have galaxies that kind of clustered together, and then you have big, open patches of the universe. And then you have galaxies that cluster together. So it gave an explanation for the sort of fundamental structure of the universe. AMOS: But I've read that two other physicists already won the Nobel Prize in 1978 for discovering this radiation. So how did these two scientists push the science along? KESTENBAUM: Right. So that was a - that's a great story, actually. That was Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson, and they discovered it in 1964. And they basically had this - they found noise in an antennae they were building, and they said what was that? And it turns out it's the same noise that's in your television when it's between stations. And it turns out that's the same noise from the beginning of the universe. And they originally thought it might be bird droppings or something, and then they finally discovered wow, this is left over from the Big Bang. And so this COBE, this satellite was able to measure it in very, very precisely and to look for actual differences in temperature - very small differences in temperature of the radiation. AMOS: Wow. So the Big Bang is on your television set? That's amazing. You mentioned that this experiment was the work of over 1,000 people. So are the days of the eureka moment, are they over? KESTENBAUM: I think in physics they may be rarer now because it's a very advanced, mature discipline. And scientists have always built on the work of other scientists. But now, trying to answer the big, big questions, the collaborations are often, you know, hundreds of people, if not more. And they require big, large, difficult experiments to do them. So, you know, it puts the Nobel Prize Committee in a bit of a bind because they have to then say, here are a thousand people, and is the leader the right person to pick? Or maybe the person who came up with the idea in the first place. It's a hard spot. AMOS: Thank you very much for explaining that one to us. NPR's David Kestenbaum.

I'm Deborah Amos in for Renee Montagne. STEVE INSKEEP, Host: NPR's Richard Harris is covering this story. Richard, good morning. RICHARD HARRIS: Good morning, Steve. INSKEEP: So what did Mr. Kornberg do? HARRIS: An enzyme called RNA polymerase that actually takes that DNA and reads it letter by letter and translates it into RNA. INSKEEP: And this tape recorder determines how we grow and what we are? HARRIS: So he figured out in incredible detail exactly how that process works by taking pictures, atom by atom pictures, of how this enzyme reads the DNA. And it's, you know, it turns out to be something like a Rube Goldberg contraption, with little springs and things that flap around and so on. And it took years and years to get - to figure out how to actually look at this thing atom by atom. But that's essentially what he did. INSKEEP: So why does it matter if you know how this process works? HARRIS: And it - basically, I mean it's really fundamentally a biological thing that, you know, if you want to understand life, you really have to understand this part of the chemistry of life. INSKEEP: Could this affect stem cell research and treatments for disease as well? HARRIS: It's a little far off of that kind of work because it's so fundamental. But, you know, there are a few things that directly interfere with it. For example, Death Cap mushrooms will actually jam up this process, and that's why they kill you. But it is really very fundamental. It's not, you know, therapy is around the corner. INSKEEP: Now we have to wonder on this morning that Roger Kornberg has won the Nobel Prize what it was like for him growing up in a family knowing that his father had won the Nobel Prize. HARRIS: And it's, you know, been obviously a great treat for Stanford to have two generations now of Kornberg's winning Nobel Prizes. INSKEEP: Well, let's continue the unintentional commercial for Stanford here. The Nobel Prize in medicine was also shared by a Stanford biologist. What are they doing right over there? HARRIS: Yeah. Well, they are doing a lot right, obviously. I think they have taken a very broad view about how to do biology, and sort of these are - these guys are in the medical school, but you would never know it because they're doing biology as well as, you know, more than medicine, really. And it's - I think it's a similar reason that Stanford decided that it wanted to get deep into stem cells as well and is building big facilities to do that. INSKEEP: So has anybody else been a father/son combination for a Nobel Prize? HARRIS: There have been a number of families. This is not the first family here. Niels Bohr's son won it at one point. The whole Curie family won it, Madame Curie and her daughter, Ir\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a8ne Joliot-Curie and Pierre Curie. Actually, Madame Curie won two of the prizes. And there are a few others. There are even a couple of brothers who've won Nobels. So it's not that extraordinary, but it's obviously not an everyday occurrence either. INSKEEP: Kind of like military brats. It runs in the family. Nobel Prize brats. HARRIS: I guess so. INSKEEP: Richard, thanks very much. HARRIS: My pleasure. INSKEEP: That's NPR's Richard Harris.

That was just conjecture, but this next story is a true tale about how a storm near Alaska broke up a giant iceberg on the other side of the world. NPR's Richard Harris reports. RICHARD HARRIS: The iceberg in question was a monster, bigger than the state of Massachusetts. It broke off the edge of Antarctica in March, 2000. Doug Macayeal, at the University of Chicago, decided to track its fate. For help, he called up a geologist friend at Northwestern University. DOUG MACAYEAL: So he and I decided we would work together and try to actually put a seismometer, which is of course the device that they use to measure earthquakes and also other kinds of vibrations, on this giant iceberg that broke off the Ross Ice Shelf, B-15. HARRIS: They got out to the iceberg in 2004 to install the instrument, and they retrieved it a year later. They then set to work poring over the ice quakes that the seismometer had recorded. MACAYEAL: The first thing we saw were signals from the great tsunami that of course devastated parts of the Indian Ocean back in December of 2004 - a very sad event, but it still was telling that we were able to see this wave come into Antarctic waters very far away and rock the icebergs. HARRIS: The seismometer had also recorded some real drama on October 27, 2005. That's the day the iceberg suddenly and mysteriously broke apart into a number of smaller, but still huge, pieces. This is the seismometer recording from that day, sped up so it compresses six hours into less than 30 seconds. (SOUNDBITE OF SEISMOMETER)MACAYEAL: And we said to ourselves well, what in the world would make this darn iceberg break up, you know, on October 27, a day of, you know, of relatively nothing going on? HARRIS: Macayeal and his colleagues figured out that the iceberg had been hit by a series of waves - not Earth waves, but ocean waves. And they used techniques that earthquake scientists use to figure out where those waves originated. MACAYEAL: Whatever the source was was 13,500 kilometers away. So the next thing we did is we sort of, you know, besides dropping our jaws and saying this is, you know, too impossible to be true, we drew a line on a map that was 13,500 kilometers away from B-15, and lo and behold, there was a very fierce, intense onset of winter storm in the Gulf of Alaska sitting right there at exactly the place where our science predicted the sources of the waves had come from. HARRIS: Macayeal asked a colleague, who makes wave forecasts for surfers, to figure out how big the waves from this storm would have been. MACAYEAL: Wave heights for this storm were above 45 feet. So these were monstrous waves. HARRIS: And by the time they had made it halfway around the world, from the Gulf of Alaska to Antarctica, they were no longer towering waves, but a powerful swell. MACAYEAL: And what we think happened is that these waves flexed the iceberg and also caused it to pound up and down on a place on the sea bed where it was just barely touching, and that this was the impetus for its great explosion, so to speak. HARRIS: They report the story of this storm felt halfway around the world in the latest issue of Geophysical Research Letters. This discovery is not only curious, it's a bit unsettling to Macayeal. He notes that some climate forecasts predict we will have more powerful storms as a result of global warming, and he says this story is evidence that those could hasten the break up of other ice sheets in Antarctica.

I'm Joe Palca, in for Ira Flatow. To paraphrase John Lennon, imagine a world with no religion. Would it be a better place? Evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins thinks so. In his new book, Dawkins lays out the case for atheism and against religion. Of course, without religion there would be no Crusades, no Salem witch hunts, no Jihadists, no televangelists, and frankly Dawkins says that's a good thing. His book argues against the existence of God, and he writes if this book works for you, you will be an atheist when you put it down. Well, this is - if this doesn't get people fired up, I'm not sure which topic we do on SCIENCE FRIDAY is. But I think that Dr. Dawkins has thrown down the gauntlet here, and I have a feeling some people will be happy to try to pick it up. But in any case, you're welcome to do so. The number is - maybe I didn't use the right expression, but I'm sure I'll get corrected - 800-989-8255. That's 1-800-989-TALK, and if you want more information about what we'll be talking about this hour, go to our Web site, www - however many - sciencefriday. com where you'll find links to our topic. And now let me introduce my guest. Richard Dawkins is an evolutionary biologist. He is currently the Charles Simonyi Professor of Public Understanding of Science at Oxford University. He is the author of many books, including The Selfish Gene and The Blind Watchmaker. His new book is The God Delusion. He joins me from BBC Studios in Oxford, and welcome back to SCIENCE FRIDAY, Dr. Dawkins. Dr. RICHARD DAWKINS (Oxford University): Thank you very much. PALCA: It's very kind to have you here. Now, okay, you wrote this book with the hope that people picking it up - religious people picking it up will be atheists when they put it down. First of all, what do you think the chances are of that? Dr. DAWKINS: That's a fairly ambitious hope, some might say almost ridiculously so. I know that I'm not going to change the minds of died in the wool faith heads, and to some extent, I may be preaching to the choir to those atheists who do read it. I do think, though, that there probably is a large middle ground of people who have always sort of been vaguely religious because they were brought up that way but probably haven't given it much thought, probably because they've got better things to do. And maybe some of them reading my book will be moved to think again, think hard, think it through, and maybe come to the conclusion that in fact the religion in which they were brought up is a lot of nonsense. PALCA: Now as I read the book, it seemed to me that a lot of the arguments were not necessarily arguments that had to be made by a scientist. I mean a sociologist could look at many of the points you make about the various, as you call them, negative aspects of religion and come to the same conclusion, not to say that a sociologist is not a scientist, I should hasten to add. But why are you as a evolutionary biologist particularly interested in taking up this topic? Dr. DAWKINS: Well, that's a very good point, and a sociologist could indeed make the points in that part of the book, which is sort of the second half, where I discuss some of the negative aspects of religion. However, the first half of the book is dominated by an argument against the existence of God, against the existence of a supernatural creator. That I regard as a scientific argument, and I don't think a sociologist would be the ideal person to make that argument. I do think that the existence of God is essentially a scientific question in the sense that a universe that contains a God would be a very different kind of universe, scientifically speaking, from a universe that does not contain a God. That I think is a scientific issue. It's not an issue that science can prove one way or the other, but it is an issue that I believe science can give a probability to. PALCA: Right. I think - I have to mention that in the last - we've been talking also on this program about the physics Nobel Prize, which was given out this year to two American scientists who were looking at the background radiation from the cosmic - from the Big Bang. And of course that's one of those places where you start to talk about the very origins of everything, and God often tends to come up. And in your book, you were talking about Einstein and his description of God, and I wonder if you can talk about the difference between the kind of a God that Einstein was talking about and the kind of a God that you're trying to disprove the existence of. Dr. DAWKINS: Yes, Einstein was indeed very fond of using the word God. He used it a lot. He was not, however, a theist in the sense that he did not believe in a personal God. He was extremely clear about that. Einstein was using the word God as a kind of name for that which we don't yet understand, the deep mystery which lies at the base of the universe. It was his kind of poetic, slightly jocular way of referring to the deep problems of physics which remain to be solved. Unfortunately, Einstein chose to use the word God, and an awful lot of people have misunderstood that to mean that Einstein was a theist. He certainly was not a theist. PALCA: But I think I have to get a little closer meaning - theist meaning someone who believes that there's some greater -Dr. DAWKINS: Yes, yes, a personal God who does such things as listens to your prayers, forgives your sins, reads your thoughts, takes an interest in human affairs. A deist is someone who believes that there is a God, but that God is purely - invented the laws of physics at the origin of the universe, invented the laws and constants of physics, set the universe going, retired and did nothing more. Einstein, in my view, wasn't even a deist, although some people might claim that he was. He certainly was not a theist. He was adamant about that. He did not believe in a personal God who takes a personal interest in human affairs. PALCA: So is there - are there people that are considered atheists but not adeists? Or is there such a word even? Dr. DAWKINS: Yeah, now what would that mean? PALCA: Yeah. Dr. DAWKINS: I think that an atheist would also be an - no, I suppose - yeah, I don't think - I've never heard the word adeist used. PALCA: No, of course not. I don't think -Dr. DAWKINS: I think that the word atheist usually tends to mean somebody who doesn't believe in any kind of God, even the deist God. PALCA: Now you talk about - quite a lot about the - it's interesting - the persecution of atheists as people who are somewhat have to hide behind their - hide their beliefs away from public sight. Why do you think that - well, first of all, do you think - how much do you really think that's true? Or were you erecting that as a straw man? And if so why if so, why is it true? Dr. DAWKINS: Well, it's not true in my country. It's not true, I suspect, in most parts of Europe. I don't live in America, and so I'm really relying upon reports from America from my American friends, from many correspondents in America. I have had a lot of letters from American atheists who say to me something like thank you for writing your article in whatever journal it was. You've expressed exactly my thoughts. I wish I dared express them myself, but I don't dare because I would be - I'd lose my wife or my job or my parents would disown me. It's really quite shocking the number of letters to that effect that I have received. PALCA: Yes, I was amazed as you were writing, some of the stories that you received. Well, okay, so is there - I mean is there a middle ground, because that is something that I, at least in my introduction to you, suggested that you were not in favor of a meeting of the minds, but maybe you can say that for yourself. Dr. DAWKINS: This is where it gets really interesting, because the majority of my scientific colleagues, who by the way are atheists, nevertheless do respect the middle ground and go out of their way to try to, in a sense, woo the middle ground, that's to say, sensible decent, religiously sophisticated believers who are not creationists - they believe in evolution, so I mean they've got some kind of education - but they do believe in God, and they might believe that God perhaps started evolution off and then let it run or perhaps designed the genetic code in such a way that evolution would be likely to occur. Now that middle ground is a sort of contested area for the political lobbyists in the American education wars, because there is a war going on between those who are trying to teach creationism in American public schools and those who think that evolution is the only theory that should be taught in science classes about where life comes from. PALCA: Right. Dr. DAWKINS: Now in those education wars, those science education wars, the middle ground, the people who believe in evolution, are wooed by, in a sense, both sides. And there is a strong evolution lobby, a strong science lobby, many of whose individual luminaries are themselves atheist, but they bend over backwards to be nice to what I call the sensible middle of the road theists who also believe in evolution, because they want to isolate the creationists. And I think that's a - I can well see that that is a very tactically, politically savvy thing to do. It isn't my way, and I've come in for a lot of criticism from some of my scientific colleagues because of that, because they feel that I'm rocking the boat and, as it were, giving aid and comfort to the creationists. And I think in a way they might have a point because I have heard that some creationists love to quote people like me because it lends weight to their claim that if you are an evolutionist that means that you have to be an atheist. So this is a matter of American politics. I'm not deeply involved in American politics. I'm concerned with what's true. For me the evolution/creation war is really just a battle. It's a skirmish in a larger war between supernaturalism and naturalism, and I don't think that I'm prepared to compromise on what I think is true in order to win a tactical battle in a skirmish in what I see as a larger war. PALCA: Okay. I would take the entire discussion, but I feel like I promised our listeners that they could have a chance, and so let's hear from some of them. And we'll go first to Corky in Dunsmore, Ohio. Corky, welcome to the program. CORKY (Caller): Oh, it's just the first time I've talked to your show though I listen to it often. PALCA: Great. CORKY: I wanted to ask, in a challenging sort of way, why if he's appealing to moderate believers to see that their religion is poppycock, so to speak, why that necessarily makes them an atheist rather than someone who believes that organized religion is nonsense and a lot of politics and personal power rather than about any kind of supernatural. PALCA: Interesting question, Corky. Let's hear what Dr. Dawkins has to say, and we only have about a minute before the break. Dr. DAWKINS: Right, I do have a lot of sympathy with that. I am passionate about what's true, and I do actually believe that there's a very strong reason to think that there is no God. On the other hand, if you're a sensible, religious person who believes in God but absolutely hates organized religion and particularly organized religion in power politics, then I'm on your side. PALCA: Well, we do have to take a short break, but we're talking to Dr. Richard Dawkins, the author of The God Delusion, and we'll have more about truth and religion when we come back. Stay with us. (Soundbite of music) From NPR News, this is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Joe Palca. We're talking this hour about science and religion with my guest Richard Dawkins. He's an evolutionary biologist at Oxford University and author of The God Delusion. And, well, I know that you describe in the book some of the great debates you've had, and I think you might have had a debate with the person I want to hear from right now. This is actually - I've got a clip of tape from an interview Ira Flatow did with Francis Collins a couple of weeks ago where Francis - I mean, Ira was trying to get Francis Collins to expand on the topic of whether or not - it sort of comes out of this last question we had - whether or not an atheist, or even somebody who doesn't particularly believe in religion, can still have faith. And here's what Francis Collins said. Dr. FRANCIS COLLINS (National Human Genome Research Institute): I think they probably are required to have more faith than many people who believe in God because they have to have faith in their own intellect's ability to know so much that they can exclude the possibility of God categorically, which seems to me the greatest statement of faith, or perhaps hubris and arrogance, that one could imagine. So, yes, faith, but in what? But as I look about myself in the culture we live in and the world we live in, a world without the kind of noble intentions that arise many times out of people's hearts in the consequence of their faith, a world that misses out on a Mother Teresa or an Oskar Schindler, a world where science has to go on in a completely materialist way, does not sound like the kind of world of wonderful humanity and nobility of humankind that I hope will be evolving over the many decades to come. PALCA: So I wanted to get your reaction to what Francis Collins had to say, Richard Dawkins. Dr. DAWKINS: There were two quite separate points there. PALCA: Right. Dr. DAWKINS: The first one interests me more, the one about an atheist needs even more faith than a theist because an atheist has to exclude positively faith, categorically exclude it. I think that's such a misguided thing to say. I mean, presumably Francis Collins does not believe in Thor, Apollo, Zeus, unicorns, fairies at the bottom of the garden, the flying spaghetti monster. There are any number of things that he doesn't believe in. And would he say that he has to have faith that there is no such thing as a flying spaghetti monster? I mean that's really essentially all that he said. Why single out God among that great litany of things that many people throughout the ages may or may not have believed in? Why single out God as being something that you have to have hubris and arrogant positive faith in order not to believe? There are a million things Francis Collins doesn't believe in. I don't believe in them either. I just add one more thing, which is the entity that he calls God. PALCA: Right. And going on to the second point, about the - losing out on some of the - well, I know you have a slightly different opinion of Mother Teresa. Dr. DAWKINS: Well, I mean the nobility of certain human characters - I wouldn't mention Mother Teresa in that breath. I don't think that she was a very admirable person. However, I do think that Martin Luther King was extremely admirable. I think Mahatma Gandhi was extremely admirable. I think that Jesus was extremely admirable. All these and many other admirable and good people were religious. Of course there are plenty of individual good people who are religious. Plenty of individual atheists who are good people. Plenty of religious people who are bad. Plenty of atheists who are bad. It doesn't really get you anywhere to compile a list of good and bad religious people and atheists. The question you want to ask is is there any general reason why you should expect that religion or atheism would be more likely to make you good or bad, and that's a very different question. It's not a question that can be answered by sort of counting heads. PALCA: Okay, let's go back and invite our callers to join this conversation, and we'll start again with Brent in Kansas City, Missouri. Brent, welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. BRENT (Caller): Hello. My question is - I am not a theist, and I don't like to categorize myself as an atheist per se, but I (unintelligible) because a lot of my friends that are atheist, it almost seems as that's become their religion, that atheism is now something that they tout as a belief system. And I almost - that's why I don't really know how to categorize myself. I mean there could be, you know, the flying spaghetti monster, anything. I don't know. I don't care, really. I mean what is your view of that. I mean, has atheism become a religion unto itself? Dr. DAWKINS: Yeah, I see what you're saying, and I think it is worry. I don't think, as a matter of fact, it has become a religion. I'm a little surprised you say you don't care, because I would have thought that that issue - and you and I agree that there is no God - but on the other hand, if there was one, it would be a tremendously important fact about life and the universe, would it not? I mean I can't imagine that you would look upon the world in quite the same way if you thought there was a God as you do now when you think that there isn't. BRENT: Well -Dr. DAWKINS: So I don't think it's something - sorry, yes, go ahead. BRENT: Well, if there were a God, there would be no way for me to have any - you know, if there were a God, I don't believe that he spoke to, you know, anybody - if anyone claimed to be a prophet today, you know, they'd be considered another David Koresch, so I mean -Dr. DAWKINS: Yeah, I think that's right. BRENT: - so how do you believe the dogma of anything so that - I mean I don't mean that I don't care in a apathetic way. I just - if there is a God, great. You know, if there's not, it doesn't affect my existence on this planet -PALCA: Okay. BRENT: - on how I'm going to behave, how I'm going to -PALCA: Okay, Brent, let's hear what Dr. Dawkins has to say in the (unintelligible) Dr. DAWKINS: Well, I think we pretty much agree. I mean I think we agree that there is no God, and I think we perhaps disagree a little bit on whether we think it makes any difference to us, and perhaps that's more of a - more like disagreeing about the kind of music we like. PALCA: I actually was going to take that in a slightly different direction. What would happen if the atheism became ascendant? And here we are in our biology class in high school, and the teacher says, Johnny, how do you - what do you think about biology? And Johnny says it was God that created everything. And so now Johnny has to sit in the corner with the dunce cap on his head because he's obviously out of touch and out of tune and not with the program, as it were, because science has shown us that everything can evolve. Does there - is there a danger of a totalitarian behavior in the other direction? Dr. DAWKINS: Well, I suppose there is, but I mean, if Johnny said that he believes that the world was flat and not round, I suppose he would sit in the corner with the dunce's cap on. I don't think you'd want to call that totalitarian. I mean the evidence for the fact of evolution is just about as strong as the evolution that the world is round and not flat. So I mean, I don't want to victimize any child for what they believe, but I do think that children should be exposed to the evidence that is available, and as it happens, the evidence for evolution is massive and utterly convincing to anybody who's studied it objectively. PALCA: Okay. Let's take another call then from Ariana in Anchorage, Alaska. Ariana, welcome to the program. ARIANA: Hi. PALCA: Hi. ARIANA: In my school there's some of the children's parents don't let their kids go to science class if the teacher teaches extensively in evolution, and I'm wondering if you have a comment on that. Dr. DAWKINS: Well, I better restrain myself. I think it's a form of mental child abuse by the parents on the children. I think that parents don't own their children, and there are limits to the rights that parents have over their children's minds. I think it - to really echo something I said in answer to the last question - it would be equivalent to parents not allowing their children to go to geography class because the geography teacher taught that the world was round, and so I do think it's a very bad thing. I think that there are limits to the freedom that parents ought to be allowed to have to brainwash their children. PALCA: Ariana, thank you for that call. ARIANA: You're welcome. PALCA: Very interesting. Yes, well - all right, let's take another call now from Patrick in Shepherdsville, Kentucky, I guess that is. Patrick, welcome to the program. PATRICK (Caller): Thank you so much for taking my call. Dr. Dawkins, I think you're brilliant. My question is if you're aware of the popularity of YouTube clips of your show The Root of All Evil and specifically the teapot atheist clips, and if you could perhaps explain that. I'm a reformed agnostic. I'm now firmly an atheist because partially of your books and your video. Thank you. PALCA: Wow. Dr. DAWKINS: Well, thank you. Thank you for that. PALCA: You didn't pay him in advance, did you? Dr. DAWKINS: I was vaguely aware that that television program called Root of All Evil - which I should stress, by the way, was not my title. I don't think religion is the root of all evil. I think it's the root of quite a lot of evil, but it's not a very catchy title, and I lost my fight with Channel Four. I tried to fight against that title. You asked about the teapot story. The teapot story was one that was invented by the great philosopher Bertram Russell to counter the point that people very often make when they say well, you can't disprove God. And I actually mentioned this earlier in connection with Francis Collins. You cannot disprove God. And so some people take that to mean that therefore the likelihood of God's existing is about equal to the likelihood that he doesn't exist, the kind of 50/50. You can't prove it. Either way you can't prove he does exist. You can't prove that he does - and certainly you can't prove he does and you can't prove that he doesn't. So it's like tossing a coin. I don't think it is like tossing a coin. And Bertram Russell's teapot story illustrates that. He said, suppose I were to tell you that there is a large china teapot in orbit around the sun which you can't see with telescopes because it's too small. You cannot disprove the teapot. But that doesn't mean that you should regard the likelihood of the teapot existing as equal to the likelihood that it doesn't exist. Nobody in their right mind believes that there is a large china teapot orbiting the sun. There's no positive reason why they should believe it. And exactly the same is true of God. That seemed to me to be an absolute, knock down reply to the statement well, you can't disprove God. Therefore you might as well believe him as likely as not. PALCA: So I guess the flying spaghetti monster is just sort of a modern incarnation of that argument. Dr. DAWKINS: Exactly. It's a modern incarnation of Russell's teapot. PALCA: Right. And just for people who don't know, the flying spaghetti monster was, I guess, started - I mean, maybe it's serious, but I guess it was started as a lark against people who thought that there was a God controlling the universe. Dr. DAWKINS: Yes. I presume it was started for the same reason as Russell's teapot. And there are a lot of people who claim to have been touched by his noodly appendage. PALCA: Right. And I have to say I learned from your book that there's now a reform movement of this. I should have checked there first. Dr. DAWKINS: A reform movement - a reform flying spaghetti monster movement, which is in conflict with the orthodox spaghetti monster movement, yes. PALCA: Right. Dr. DAWKINS: A great schism. PALCA: Let's - thank you for the American pronunciation, by the way. Let's take one more call. Todd in Smithville, Missouri. Welcome to the program. TODD (Caller): Thank you. Dr. Dawkins, I look forward to getting your book and reading it. I'm always fascinated by these discussions. I personally am at least a theist and probably deist. I'm a man of great faith, but certainly have a disenchantment with organized religion as it is now. But I was thinking more from an anthropological standpoint that early civilization, before they knew about a God, created their own religion out of an innate human need to create understanding about the world about them, because I cynically believe that everybody believes what makes them most comfortable. And so I'm looking for answers, do we as human beings have an innate need to just create these things? Dr. DAWKINS: Well, that looks very plausible to me. And you're perfectly right that anthropologists have described religious beliefs from tribes all around the world. They vary in detail, but they have a lot of general things in common. Your idea that people believe what they find comfortable, well, I'm afraid it's all too plausible. I don't - I can't really empathize with it because I can't understand why anybody would think that just because something is comforting that makes it true. And there are all sorts of things that I would like to be true. But unfortunately it's just tough. They're not. And so I don't really understand why people take that line, though I think you're probably right that they do. I'm a little curious why, in view of what you've just said, you are yourself a believer. PALCA: I'm afraid he's no longer on the line. Dr. DAWKINS: Oh, okay. Fine. PALCA: We'll ask him the next time. But in the mean time, I'll invite others to call. We're speaking with Richard Dawkins, professor at Oxford University and the author of a new book, The God Delusion. I'm Joe Palca. And this is TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. One of the things that I wanted to ask you about is I think what happens a lot of the time in this question of is there something that's the invisible hand behind things is there are so many - and I'm going to use this word purposefully - miraculous things that happen in biology, whether it's, you know, getting potassium ions to flow through a membrane wall when the sodium ions are excluded and the sodium ions are smaller, or whether it's something far more sophisticated or that you can go from a fertilized egg to an entire human being without a significant enough number of mistakes to have our arms attached to our heads or something like that. And so the word I would say is miraculous. And I think what happens is people have a hard time accepting the fact that such a remarkable thing can happen not by chance, as you point out, but through a selection process that would have eventually gotten to this point. And my thesis - and you can knock it down if you like - is that people have a really hard time understanding extremely big numbers, because what this - all the things that led to these events are small occurrences, lower probability occurrences, but they could occur. And when you start talking about things that could occur, if you're talking on the scope of billions of years, then you begin to think that things could occur, that could occur, do occur. Dr. DAWKINS: Well that's a lot of interesting stuff there. That's very interesting. I think the argument that even very, very improbable things, given enough billions of years if they could occur they will, that's an argument which I would use not actually for the details of biological organization, like potassium and sodium ions and things. I would use that for possibly the origin of life, the events in the primeval soup that led to the first self-replicating molecule. I have made a case that that could have been a genuinely very, very, very improbable event, possibly the sort of event so improbable that it occurs only, say, one in a billion planets. And there are so many billions of planets in the universe that it has to have happened on some of them. And here we are sitting on one of them so it had to be ours. Now that's an argument I'd use for the origin of life. I would not use that argument for the so-called miraculous things that you'd perceive in the details of life, things like eyes and hemoglobin molecules and sodium pumps in nerves and things of that sort, because natural selection is actually - Darwinian natural selection is not of that character. It's not one of those things where it's very, very, very improbable but there'd be enough billions of years for it to happen. It's not actually all that improbable. Each step of evolution is not particularly improbable. What is improbable is the accumulated result of many, many, many steps in evolution added together in cascade. When you look at something really remarkably, beautifully, apparently designed, what you've called miraculous I think is an unfortunate word. Something like a nerve cell, that is the end product of a very large number of cumulative steps of evolution giving rise to what seems to be a very improbable result. PALCA: Dr. Dawkins, I committed the unforgivable sin of asking a very complicated question without enough time. But I'll have to quickly thank you and encourage people if they want to learn more about your opinions to get your book, The God Delusion. Thanks for joining us today. We'll be right back. Stay with us.  JOE PALCA, host:  This is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. I'm Joe Palca, in for Ira Flatow.  To paraphrase John Lennon, imagine a world with no religion. Would it be a better place? Evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins thinks so. In his new book, Dawkins lays out the case for atheism and against religion.  Of course, without religion there would be no Crusades, no Salem witch hunts, no Jihadists, no televangelists, and frankly Dawkins says that's a good thing. His book argues against the existence of God, and he writes if this book works for you, you will be an atheist when you put it down.  Well, this is - if this doesn't get people fired up, I'm not sure which topic we do on SCIENCE FRIDAY is. But I think that Dr. Dawkins has thrown down the gauntlet here, and I have a feeling some people will be happy to try to pick it up. But in any case, you're welcome to do so. The number is - maybe I didn't use the right expression, but I'm sure I'll get corrected - 800-989-8255. That's 1-800-989-TALK, and if you want more information about what we'll be talking about this hour, go to our Web site, www - however many - sciencefriday. com where you'll find links to our topic.  And now let me introduce my guest. Richard Dawkins is an evolutionary biologist. He is currently the Charles Simonyi Professor of Public Understanding of Science at Oxford University. He is the author of many books, including The Selfish Gene and The Blind Watchmaker. His new book is The God Delusion. He joins me from BBC Studios in Oxford, and welcome back to SCIENCE FRIDAY, Dr. Dawkins.  Dr. RICHARD DAWKINS (Oxford University): Thank you very much.  PALCA: It's very kind to have you here. Now, okay, you wrote this book with the hope that people picking it up - religious people picking it up will be atheists when they put it down. First of all, what do you think the chances are of that?  Dr. DAWKINS: That's a fairly ambitious hope, some might say almost ridiculously so. I know that I'm not going to change the minds of died in the wool faith heads, and to some extent, I may be preaching to the choir to those atheists who do read it.  I do think, though, that there probably is a large middle ground of people who have always sort of been vaguely religious because they were brought up that way but probably haven't given it much thought, probably because they've got better things to do. And maybe some of them reading my book will be moved to think again, think hard, think it through, and maybe come to the conclusion that in fact the religion in which they were brought up is a lot of nonsense.  PALCA: Now as I read the book, it seemed to me that a lot of the arguments were not necessarily arguments that had to be made by a scientist. I mean a sociologist could look at many of the points you make about the various, as you call them, negative aspects of religion and come to the same conclusion, not to say that a sociologist is not a scientist, I should hasten to add. But why are you as a evolutionary biologist particularly interested in taking up this topic?  Dr. DAWKINS: Well, that's a very good point, and a sociologist could indeed make the points in that part of the book, which is sort of the second half, where I discuss some of the negative aspects of religion. However, the first half of the book is dominated by an argument against the existence of God, against the existence of a supernatural creator. That I regard as a scientific argument, and I don't think a sociologist would be the ideal person to make that argument.  I do think that the existence of God is essentially a scientific question in the sense that a universe that contains a God would be a very different kind of universe, scientifically speaking, from a universe that does not contain a God. That I think is a scientific issue. It's not an issue that science can prove one way or the other, but it is an issue that I believe science can give a probability to.  PALCA: Right. I think - I have to mention that in the last - we've been talking also on this program about the physics Nobel Prize, which was given out this year to two American scientists who were looking at the background radiation from the cosmic - from the Big Bang. And of course that's one of those places where you start to talk about the very origins of everything, and God often tends to come up.  And in your book, you were talking about Einstein and his description of God, and I wonder if you can talk about the difference between the kind of a God that Einstein was talking about and the kind of a God that you're trying to disprove the existence of.  Dr. DAWKINS: Yes, Einstein was indeed very fond of using the word God. He used it a lot. He was not, however, a theist in the sense that he did not believe in a personal God. He was extremely clear about that. Einstein was using the word God as a kind of name for that which we don't yet understand, the deep mystery which lies at the base of the universe. It was his kind of poetic, slightly jocular way of referring to the deep problems of physics which remain to be solved. Unfortunately, Einstein chose to use the word God, and an awful lot of people have misunderstood that to mean that Einstein was a theist. He certainly was not a theist.  PALCA: But I think I have to get a little closer meaning - theist meaning someone who believes that there's some greater - Dr. DAWKINS: Yes, yes, a personal God who does such things as listens to your prayers, forgives your sins, reads your thoughts, takes an interest in human affairs. A deist is someone who believes that there is a God, but that God is purely - invented the laws of physics at the origin of the universe, invented the laws and constants of physics, set the universe going, retired and did nothing more.  Einstein, in my view, wasn't even a deist, although some people might claim that he was. He certainly was not a theist. He was adamant about that. He did not believe in a personal God who takes a personal interest in human affairs.  PALCA: So is there - are there people that are considered atheists but not adeists? Or is there such a word even?  Dr. DAWKINS: Yeah, now what would that mean?  PALCA: Yeah.  Dr. DAWKINS: I think that an atheist would also be an - no, I suppose - yeah, I don't think - I've never heard the word adeist used.  PALCA: No, of course not. I don't think - Dr. DAWKINS: I think that the word atheist usually tends to mean somebody who doesn't believe in any kind of God, even the deist God.  PALCA: Now you talk about - quite a lot about the - it's interesting - the persecution of atheists as people who are somewhat have to hide behind their - hide their beliefs away from public sight. Why do you think that - well, first of all, do you think - how much do you really think that's true? Or were you erecting that as a straw man? And if so why if so, why is it true?  Dr. DAWKINS: Well, it's not true in my country. It's not true, I suspect, in most parts of Europe. I don't live in America, and so I'm really relying upon reports from America from my American friends, from many correspondents in America.  I have had a lot of letters from American atheists who say to me something like thank you for writing your article in whatever journal it was. You've expressed exactly my thoughts. I wish I dared express them myself, but I don't dare because I would be - I'd lose my wife or my job or my parents would disown me. It's really quite shocking the number of letters to that effect that I have received.  PALCA: Yes, I was amazed as you were writing, some of the stories that you received. Well, okay, so is there - I mean is there a middle ground, because that is something that I, at least in my introduction to you, suggested that you were not in favor of a meeting of the minds, but maybe you can say that for yourself.  Dr. DAWKINS: This is where it gets really interesting, because the majority of my scientific colleagues, who by the way are atheists, nevertheless do respect the middle ground and go out of their way to try to, in a sense, woo the middle ground, that's to say, sensible decent, religiously sophisticated believers who are not creationists - they believe in evolution, so I mean they've got some kind of education - but they do believe in God, and they might believe that God perhaps started evolution off and then let it run or perhaps designed the genetic code in such a way that evolution would be likely to occur.  Now that middle ground is a sort of contested area for the political lobbyists in the American education wars, because there is a war going on between those who are trying to teach creationism in American public schools and those who think that evolution is the only theory that should be taught in science classes about where life comes from.  PALCA: Right.  Dr. DAWKINS: Now in those education wars, those science education wars, the middle ground, the people who believe in evolution, are wooed by, in a sense, both sides. And there is a strong evolution lobby, a strong science lobby, many of whose individual luminaries are themselves atheist, but they bend over backwards to be nice to what I call the sensible middle of the road theists who also believe in evolution, because they want to isolate the creationists. And I think that's a - I can well see that that is a very tactically, politically savvy thing to do.  It isn't my way, and I've come in for a lot of criticism from some of my scientific colleagues because of that, because they feel that I'm rocking the boat and, as it were, giving aid and comfort to the creationists. And I think in a way they might have a point because I have heard that some creationists love to quote people like me because it lends weight to their claim that if you are an evolutionist that means that you have to be an atheist.  So this is a matter of American politics. I'm not deeply involved in American politics. I'm concerned with what's true. For me the evolution/creation war is really just a battle. It's a skirmish in a larger war between supernaturalism and naturalism, and I don't think that I'm prepared to compromise on what I think is true in order to win a tactical battle in a skirmish in what I see as a larger war.  PALCA: Okay. I would take the entire discussion, but I feel like I promised our listeners that they could have a chance, and so let's hear from some of them. And we'll go first to Corky in Dunsmore, Ohio. Corky, welcome to the program.  CORKY (Caller): Oh, it's just the first time I've talked to your show though I listen to it often.  PALCA: Great.  CORKY: I wanted to ask, in a challenging sort of way, why if he's appealing to moderate believers to see that their religion is poppycock, so to speak, why that necessarily makes them an atheist rather than someone who believes that organized religion is nonsense and a lot of politics and personal power rather than about any kind of supernatural.  PALCA: Interesting question, Corky. Let's hear what Dr. Dawkins has to say, and we only have about a minute before the break.  Dr. DAWKINS: Right, I do have a lot of sympathy with that. I am passionate about what's true, and I do actually believe that there's a very strong reason to think that there is no God. On the other hand, if you're a sensible, religious person who believes in God but absolutely hates organized religion and particularly organized religion in power politics, then I'm on your side.  PALCA: Well, we do have to take a short break, but we're talking to Dr. Richard Dawkins, the author of The God Delusion, and we'll have more about truth and religion when we come back. Stay with us.  (Soundbite of music)  From NPR News, this is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Joe Palca.  We're talking this hour about science and religion with my guest Richard Dawkins. He's an evolutionary biologist at Oxford University and author of The God Delusion.  And, well, I know that you describe in the book some of the great debates you've had, and I think you might have had a debate with the person I want to hear from right now. This is actually - I've got a clip of tape from an interview Ira Flatow did with Francis Collins a couple of weeks ago where Francis - I mean, Ira was trying to get Francis Collins to expand on the topic of whether or not - it sort of comes out of this last question we had - whether or not an atheist, or even somebody who doesn't particularly believe in religion, can still have faith. And here's what Francis Collins said.  Dr. FRANCIS COLLINS (National Human Genome Research Institute): I think they probably are required to have more faith than many people who believe in God because they have to have faith in their own intellect's ability to know so much that they can exclude the possibility of God categorically, which seems to me the greatest statement of faith, or perhaps hubris and arrogance, that one could imagine. So, yes, faith, but in what?  But as I look about myself in the culture we live in and the world we live in, a world without the kind of noble intentions that arise many times out of people's hearts in the consequence of their faith, a world that misses out on a Mother Teresa or an Oskar Schindler, a world where science has to go on in a completely materialist way, does not sound like the kind of world of wonderful humanity and nobility of humankind that I hope will be evolving over the many decades to come.  PALCA: So I wanted to get your reaction to what Francis Collins had to say, Richard Dawkins.  Dr. DAWKINS: There were two quite separate points there.  PALCA: Right.  Dr. DAWKINS: The first one interests me more, the one about an atheist needs even more faith than a theist because an atheist has to exclude positively faith, categorically exclude it.  I think that's such a misguided thing to say. I mean, presumably Francis Collins does not believe in Thor, Apollo, Zeus, unicorns, fairies at the bottom of the garden, the flying spaghetti monster. There are any number of things that he doesn't believe in. And would he say that he has to have faith that there is no such thing as a flying spaghetti monster? I mean that's really essentially all that he said.  Why single out God among that great litany of things that many people throughout the ages may or may not have believed in? Why single out God as being something that you have to have hubris and arrogant positive faith in order not to believe? There are a million things Francis Collins doesn't believe in. I don't believe in them either. I just add one more thing, which is the entity that he calls God.  PALCA: Right. And going on to the second point, about the - losing out on some of the - well, I know you have a slightly different opinion of Mother Teresa.  Dr. DAWKINS: Well, I mean the nobility of certain human characters - I wouldn't mention Mother Teresa in that breath. I don't think that she was a very admirable person. However, I do think that Martin Luther King was extremely admirable. I think Mahatma Gandhi was extremely admirable. I think that Jesus was extremely admirable. All these and many other admirable and good people were religious.  Of course there are plenty of individual good people who are religious. Plenty of individual atheists who are good people. Plenty of religious people who are bad. Plenty of atheists who are bad. It doesn't really get you anywhere to compile a list of good and bad religious people and atheists.  The question you want to ask is is there any general reason why you should expect that religion or atheism would be more likely to make you good or bad, and that's a very different question. It's not a question that can be answered by sort of counting heads.  PALCA: Okay, let's go back and invite our callers to join this conversation, and we'll start again with Brent in Kansas City, Missouri. Brent, welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY.  BRENT (Caller): Hello. My question is - I am not a theist, and I don't like to categorize myself as an atheist per se, but I (unintelligible) because a lot of my friends that are atheist, it almost seems as that's become their religion, that atheism is now something that they tout as a belief system. And I almost - that's why I don't really know how to categorize myself. I mean there could be, you know, the flying spaghetti monster, anything. I don't know. I don't care, really. I mean what is your view of that. I mean, has atheism become a religion unto itself?  Dr. DAWKINS: Yeah, I see what you're saying, and I think it is worry. I don't think, as a matter of fact, it has become a religion. I'm a little surprised you say you don't care, because I would have thought that that issue - and you and I agree that there is no God - but on the other hand, if there was one, it would be a tremendously important fact about life and the universe, would it not? I mean I can't imagine that you would look upon the world in quite the same way if you thought there was a God as you do now when you think that there isn't.  BRENT: Well - Dr. DAWKINS: So I don't think it's something - sorry, yes, go ahead.  BRENT: Well, if there were a God, there would be no way for me to have any - you know, if there were a God, I don't believe that he spoke to, you know, anybody - if anyone claimed to be a prophet today, you know, they'd be considered another David Koresch, so I mean - Dr. DAWKINS: Yeah, I think that's right.  BRENT: - so how do you believe the dogma of anything so that - I mean I don't mean that I don't care in a apathetic way. I just - if there is a God, great. You know, if there's not, it doesn't affect my existence on this planet - PALCA: Okay.  BRENT: - on how I'm going to behave, how I'm going to - PALCA: Okay, Brent, let's hear what Dr. Dawkins has to say in the (unintelligible)  Dr. DAWKINS: Well, I think we pretty much agree. I mean I think we agree that there is no God, and I think we perhaps disagree a little bit on whether we think it makes any difference to us, and perhaps that's more of a - more like disagreeing about the kind of music we like.  PALCA: I actually was going to take that in a slightly different direction. What would happen if the atheism became ascendant? And here we are in our biology class in high school, and the teacher says, Johnny, how do you - what do you think about biology? And Johnny says it was God that created everything. And so now Johnny has to sit in the corner with the dunce cap on his head because he's obviously out of touch and out of tune and not with the program, as it were, because science has shown us that everything can evolve. Does there - is there a danger of a totalitarian behavior in the other direction?  Dr. DAWKINS: Well, I suppose there is, but I mean, if Johnny said that he believes that the world was flat and not round, I suppose he would sit in the corner with the dunce's cap on. I don't think you'd want to call that totalitarian. I mean the evidence for the fact of evolution is just about as strong as the evolution that the world is round and not flat. So I mean, I don't want to victimize any child for what they believe, but I do think that children should be exposed to the evidence that is available, and as it happens, the evidence for evolution is massive and utterly convincing to anybody who's studied it objectively.  PALCA: Okay. Let's take another call then from Ariana in Anchorage, Alaska. Ariana, welcome to the program.  ARIANA: Hi.  PALCA: Hi.  ARIANA: In my school there's some of the children's parents don't let their kids go to science class if the teacher teaches extensively in evolution, and I'm wondering if you have a comment on that.  Dr. DAWKINS: Well, I better restrain myself. I think it's a form of mental child abuse by the parents on the children. I think that parents don't own their children, and there are limits to the rights that parents have over their children's minds. I think it - to really echo something I said in answer to the last question - it would be equivalent to parents not allowing their children to go to geography class because the geography teacher taught that the world was round, and so I do think it's a very bad thing. I think that there are limits to the freedom that parents ought to be allowed to have to brainwash their children.  PALCA: Ariana, thank you for that call.  ARIANA: You're welcome.  PALCA: Very interesting. Yes, well - all right, let's take another call now from Patrick in Shepherdsville, Kentucky, I guess that is. Patrick, welcome to the program.  PATRICK (Caller): Thank you so much for taking my call. Dr. Dawkins, I think you're brilliant. My question is if you're aware of the popularity of YouTube clips of your show The Root of All Evil and specifically the teapot atheist clips, and if you could perhaps explain that. I'm a reformed agnostic. I'm now firmly an atheist because partially of your books and your video. Thank you.  PALCA: Wow.  Dr. DAWKINS: Well, thank you. Thank you for that.  PALCA: You didn't pay him in advance, did you?  Dr. DAWKINS: I was vaguely aware that that television program called Root of All Evil - which I should stress, by the way, was not my title. I don't think religion is the root of all evil. I think it's the root of quite a lot of evil, but it's not a very catchy title, and I lost my fight with Channel Four. I tried to fight against that title.  You asked about the teapot story. The teapot story was one that was invented by the great philosopher Bertram Russell to counter the point that people very often make when they say well, you can't disprove God. And I actually mentioned this earlier in connection with Francis Collins. You cannot disprove God.  And so some people take that to mean that therefore the likelihood of God's existing is about equal to the likelihood that he doesn't exist, the kind of 50/50. You can't prove it. Either way you can't prove he does exist. You can't prove that he does - and certainly you can't prove he does and you can't prove that he doesn't. So it's like tossing a coin.  I don't think it is like tossing a coin. And Bertram Russell's teapot story illustrates that. He said, suppose I were to tell you that there is a large china teapot in orbit around the sun which you can't see with telescopes because it's too small.  You cannot disprove the teapot. But that doesn't mean that you should regard the likelihood of the teapot existing as equal to the likelihood that it doesn't exist.  Nobody in their right mind believes that there is a large china teapot orbiting the sun. There's no positive reason why they should believe it. And exactly the same is true of God. That seemed to me to be an absolute, knock down reply to the statement well, you can't disprove God. Therefore you might as well believe him as likely as not.  PALCA: So I guess the flying spaghetti monster is just sort of a modern incarnation of that argument.  Dr. DAWKINS: Exactly. It's a modern incarnation of Russell's teapot.  PALCA: Right. And just for people who don't know, the flying spaghetti monster was, I guess, started - I mean, maybe it's serious, but I guess it was started as a lark against people who thought that there was a God controlling the universe.  Dr. DAWKINS: Yes. I presume it was started for the same reason as Russell's teapot. And there are a lot of people who claim to have been touched by his noodly appendage.  PALCA: Right. And I have to say I learned from your book that there's now a reform movement of this. I should have checked there first.  Dr. DAWKINS: A reform movement - a reform flying spaghetti monster movement, which is in conflict with the orthodox spaghetti monster movement, yes.  PALCA: Right.  Dr. DAWKINS: A great schism.  PALCA: Let's - thank you for the American pronunciation, by the way. Let's take one more call. Todd in Smithville, Missouri. Welcome to the program.  TODD (Caller): Thank you. Dr. Dawkins, I look forward to getting your book and reading it. I'm always fascinated by these discussions. I personally am at least a theist and probably deist. I'm a man of great faith, but certainly have a disenchantment with organized religion as it is now.  But I was thinking more from an anthropological standpoint that early civilization, before they knew about a God, created their own religion out of an innate human need to create understanding about the world about them, because I cynically believe that everybody believes what makes them most comfortable. And so I'm looking for answers, do we as human beings have an innate need to just create these things?  Dr. DAWKINS: Well, that looks very plausible to me. And you're perfectly right that anthropologists have described religious beliefs from tribes all around the world. They vary in detail, but they have a lot of general things in common.  Your idea that people believe what they find comfortable, well, I'm afraid it's all too plausible. I don't - I can't really empathize with it because I can't understand why anybody would think that just because something is comforting that makes it true. And there are all sorts of things that I would like to be true. But unfortunately it's just tough. They're not.  And so I don't really understand why people take that line, though I think you're probably right that they do. I'm a little curious why, in view of what you've just said, you are yourself a believer.  PALCA: I'm afraid he's no longer on the line.  Dr. DAWKINS: Oh, okay. Fine.  PALCA: We'll ask him the next time. But in the mean time, I'll invite others to call. We're speaking with Richard Dawkins, professor at Oxford University and the author of a new book, The God Delusion. I'm Joe Palca. And this is TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.  One of the things that I wanted to ask you about is I think what happens a lot of the time in this question of is there something that's the invisible hand behind things is there are so many - and I'm going to use this word purposefully - miraculous things that happen in biology, whether it's, you know, getting potassium ions to flow through a membrane wall when the sodium ions are excluded and the sodium ions are smaller, or whether it's something far more sophisticated or that you can go from a fertilized egg to an entire human being without a significant enough number of mistakes to have our arms attached to our heads or something like that.  And so the word I would say is miraculous. And I think what happens is people have a hard time accepting the fact that such a remarkable thing can happen not by chance, as you point out, but through a selection process that would have eventually gotten to this point.  And my thesis - and you can knock it down if you like - is that people have a really hard time understanding extremely big numbers, because what this - all the things that led to these events are small occurrences, lower probability occurrences, but they could occur.  And when you start talking about things that could occur, if you're talking on the scope of billions of years, then you begin to think that things could occur, that could occur, do occur.  Dr. DAWKINS: Well that's a lot of interesting stuff there. That's very interesting. I think the argument that even very, very improbable things, given enough billions of years if they could occur they will, that's an argument which I would use not actually for the details of biological organization, like potassium and sodium ions and things.  I would use that for possibly the origin of life, the events in the primeval soup that led to the first self-replicating molecule. I have made a case that that could have been a genuinely very, very, very improbable event, possibly the sort of event so improbable that it occurs only, say, one in a billion planets. And there are so many billions of planets in the universe that it has to have happened on some of them. And here we are sitting on one of them so it had to be ours.  Now that's an argument I'd use for the origin of life. I would not use that argument for the so-called miraculous things that you'd perceive in the details of life, things like eyes and hemoglobin molecules and sodium pumps in nerves and things of that sort, because natural selection is actually - Darwinian natural selection is not of that character. It's not one of those things where it's very, very, very improbable but there'd be enough billions of years for it to happen.  It's not actually all that improbable. Each step of evolution is not particularly improbable. What is improbable is the accumulated result of many, many, many steps in evolution added together in cascade.  When you look at something really remarkably, beautifully, apparently designed, what you've called miraculous I think is an unfortunate word. Something like a nerve cell, that is the end product of a very large number of cumulative steps of evolution giving rise to what seems to be a very improbable result.  PALCA: Dr. Dawkins, I committed the unforgivable sin of asking a very complicated question without enough time. But I'll have to quickly thank you and encourage people if they want to learn more about your opinions to get your book, The God Delusion. Thanks for joining us today. We'll be right back.

But for years a real company called Genetic Savings and Clone has promised to recreate pets. Now, to the chagrin of some animal lovers, the firm is going out of business. NPR's Nell Boyce reports. NELL BOYCE: Genetic Savings and Clone has gotten lots and lots of publicity since it was founded six years ago. Lou Hawthorne is its CEO. He promoted cloning as a realistic option for pet owners who had a very special cat or dog. Here's what he said to NPR back in 2004. (Soundbite of NPR broadcast) Mr. LOU HAWTHORNE (CEO, Genetic Savings and Clone): If the goal is to get as close as possible to an extraordinary animal, this is the way to do it. BOYCE: The firm did fund research that produced the world's first cloned cat, a calico named C. C. , but just a few clients got cat clones. And although the company kept saying cloned dogs were on the way, none appeared. Now when you call the company you hear this: Unidentified Man #2: Thank you for calling Genetic Savings and Clone. We are no longer accepting orders. BOYCE: Some critics of the company think it's great that the firm is closing. Wayne Pacelle is head of the Humane Society of the United States. Mr. WAYNE PACELLE (Humane Society of the United States): Why do you need this? You've got millions of healthy and adoptable cats that people who want a loving companion can obtain for just a few dollars at a local shelter. BOYCE: At Genetic Savings and Clone, a cat clone costs $32,000, but some people were interested. Carol Meltzer of Oceanside, New York, is one of the company's customers. She used to have a golden retriever named Lucky. Ms. CAROL MELTZER (Genetic Savings and Clone Customer): He was just a really good dog, and his smartness made you feel like he was almost human. BOYCE: She might not have paid tens of thousands for cloning, but she did give the company about $100 a year to preserve Lucky's DNA until cloning became cheap and routine. Now the firm wants to know what it should do with Lucky's DNA. Meltzer could discard it or send it to another company that stores genetic samples. She has mixed feelings. Ms. MELTZER: When I signed up with the company, I had high hopes that it would be accomplished in a couple of years. And now that, you know, I don't know, so I didn't really decide what to do yet. BOYCE: It's understandable that she's so uncertain. After all, only one dog has ever been cloned, by researchers in South Korea, and experts in cloning said they don't know of any other scientists who are working aggressively to clone pets. A few companies now routinely clone pigs and cows, but there's a lot of money in farming, so livestock reproduction has been studied and manipulated for decades. Some biologists think pet cloning will happen eventually. Betsy Dresser has produced 10 clones of endangered wildcats at the Audubon Nature Institute in New Orleans. Ms. BETSY DRESSER (Audubon Nature Institute, New Orleans): You know, science always advances, and knowing what I know about cat cloning, I certainly think that it's a possibility for the future if somebody, you know, wants to take it on and do it for private owners or, you know, people with pet cats. BOYCE: But if Genetic Savings and Clone couldn't make a go of it after spending years and millions of dollars, it's unclear whether any investors will look at its business model and say, I want to clone that.

I'm Neal Conan in Washington. Tomorrow on TALK OF THE NATION, part two in our series America at 300 million. If you're married for the first time ever, you're now in the minority. That reflects a cultural shift that will affect all us Americans. The unmarried majority and what it means to us. Plus the world's first female space tourist. That's tomorrow on TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. Right now an update on the earthquake that struck Hawaii over the weekend. It was the strongest quake to hit the islands in more than two decades - magnitude 6. 7. We'll talk more about what those numbers mean in just a couple of minutes. The epicenter was on the west coast of the big island - Hawaii. The quake caused blackouts and landslides, and it's taking awhile to restore power in many areas and officials are inspecting bridges and roads for damage. So far, though, no deaths have been reported as a result of the quake. If you're in Hawaii and are able to hear this program, we'd like to hear from you. What happened where you live? Is there damage in your area? Give us a call, 800-989-8255, 800-989-TALK. E-mail us: talk@npr. org. To talk more about the situation in Hawaii we're joined now by Kayla Rosenfeld, news director at Hawaii Public Radio. She joins us by phone from her office in Honolulu. And thanks very much for being with us today. KAYLA ROSENFELD: It's a pleasure, Neal. Thank you. CONAN: And I understand people who might ordinarily hear this program on Hawaii Public Radio are not hearing it. ROSENFELD: Well, actually, luckily to say, they are hearing it. We have had our power restored. It came on about 7:15 this morning. So, yes, we do have an audience. CONAN: Well, congratulations. Last time we talked to you it was still off. So are people around the islands getting their power back too? ROSENFELD: Yes. The majority of the islands has received restored electrical power, but there are pockets that are still out. And a recent conversation with the Hawaiian Electric spokesman said that they're bringing the power grid up little by little so that they do not overload the system. CONAN: Now this happened I guess about 7 a. m. Sunday morning your time. Did you realize right away it was an earthquake? ROSENFELD: Yes. It was pretty obvious. The world shook around us. CONAN: What happened? Where were you? ROSENFELD: I was in bed, as were many people. But I did speak with others who had been in their kitchens or in a certain part of the house. And they described really feeling the earth shake. The first was a good, solid shake. The first quake at 7:08. The second aftershock that came about eight minutes later people described as sort of a wave. They could feel like the earth sort of swish underneath them. CONAN: Swish underneath them. This is an unusual development. I gather there are earthquakes all the time in Hawaii, or frequently, but not this big. ROSENFELD: Not this big. That's correct. Tremors are felt simply because we are, you know, in a plate tectonic hotspot. But this one was pretty significant. CONAN: We've got a caller on the line from Honolulu. This is Mary. Mary's calling us from Honolulu. Nice to have you with us Mary. MARY (CALLER): Thank you. CONAN: And what was it like for you? MARY: Well, I'm on the windward side of Oahu and I had just gotten up and was about ready to make a pot of coffee and I heard it coming. It sounded like a rumbling, like a low-flying jet or something like that. And then it went on for quite awhile. And then when it hit, my whole house just - the walls - like I -the roof creaked and I had some pictures and things that fell off of my bookshelf and - I mean that's the strongest. We had one a couple of months in Kailua, and that was by far 10-times stronger than what we had. And my dogs were just totally freaking out. I tried to get them to go outside because I figured if things started falling, I have a yard at least we could be out in the open. And I mean it was very strong. Everything was moving. And then it was - as soon as it happened I went outside to see if anybody else had come out in the street and it was just eerily quiet. It was almost surreal. And then within like 30 seconds, all these car alarms started going off. CONAN: Shaken by the motion, yeah. MARY: Yeah. And one by one, people started coming out of their houses. And then like 5 minutes later, the power just went off. Although, I understand that wasn't because of the earthquake, that was a safety measure. And\u2026 CONAN: Everybody okay, Mary? MARY: Yeah, we're okay. It was just kind of scary and it took - we didn't get our power back until about 1:00 a. m. CONAN: Hmm. And let me ask you, Kayla Rosenfeld. Pretty scary, very strange but nobody got hurt. That seems to be the experience throughout the island. ROSENFELD: That is correct. There were no significant reported injuries. Most of the damage was structural damage to buildings. There were a couple of sinkholes reported on the big island of Hawaii, but no physical damage to people. CONAN: Mary, have things returned to normal? MARY: Yeah, pretty much. There were still a lot of traffic late south. Getting into work this morning was kind of interesting. But in reality, what I saw is the community kind of coming together. I saw a lot of kids playing on the streets in, you know, neighborhoods that you'd never see kids out on the streets, you know, because they're inside playing Nintendo or people are watching TV. I mean it was - I actually really enjoyed not having power. It was kind of an interesting experience. Everybody came together. I talked to people I probably would not have normally talked to. So in a way I think a lot of good came out of it. It was - I know it was scary but I think, you know, it kind of bonded us as a community as well. CONAN: Hmm. Thanks very much, Mary. Good luck to you. MARY: Thanks. CONAN: Kayla Rosenfeld, as people look at the damage that was inflicted on buildings and roads and highways, obviously Hawaii is one of those places where people plan for this sort of thing? ROSENFELD: Yes. We do plan for this sort of thing, but, you know, like any community, you can never be ready for a natural disaster like this. There's always something that could have been done differently. CONAN: And could have been done better. ROSENFELD: And better, yes. CONAN: Let's see if we can get another caller on the line. And let's go to - this is Vince(ph). Vince in Pahala, I hope I'm pronouncing that correctly. VINCE (Caller): Yes. Yes. Good morning, Neal. How are you? CONAN: Good to - I'm well. Thank you. Good afternoon here in Washington, but go ahead. VINCE: Yes. It's still morning here. Yeah, it was an interesting, interesting wake-up call yesterday morning. CONAN: Hah. What happened? VINCE: About a little after 7:00, 7:10 I guess. And I was actually just settling in, listen to the NPR in the morning. And all of a sudden, you know - we always get these small tremors. We live about 11 miles from the volcano, so they think it's kind of average. But then it started up and it just kept increasing. And then the next thing I know, the coffee jumped out of the cup. This was the first one I've ever felt like I couldn't walk because everything was shaking so much. CONAN: And did you follow all the advice that we've heard all these years to get to a, you know, the strongest part of the structure, maybe a door? VINCE: No. Actually, it just - it seems like it just happened so fast. Like I said, even walking was difficult. And the homes down here, the old plantation homes are all post and pier, so they just kind of dance around on top. It' not - they're not directly connected with the ground at all by foundations. You know, no basements at all on these. So they seem to have bounced around pretty well, but they survived pretty well because of that as well. CONAN: So no big damage where you live? VINCE: No, nothing at all - thankfully with the house and no one in the community was hurt. Just a couple of lamps, but nothing that wasn't replaceable. CONAN: Congratulations, Vince, you made it. VINCE: Yeah. Yeah. Nothing like living in paradise. CONAN: I suppose not. Thanks very much for the call. VINCE: Thank you. CONAN: And, Kayla, as you look around and as you get reports back in from the government throughout the day today, obviously getting power up is going to be a problem in some areas in, I guess bridges, highways are going to be inspected for damage. What's the biggest problem people anticipate? ROSENFELD: Well, right now I'd say that we're just sort of wrapping up morning rush hour, and there have been some issues with the traffic lights still not being operational. They're flashing and the police have suggested that people treat the intersections as four-way intersections. Mostly that's it here on Oahu. On the neighbor islands of course there are the issues of cleaning away boulders and there were some landslides. As I mention, there was a sinkhole. So really just examining the condition of the roads. CONAN: And did the quake generate any tsunamis? ROSENFELD: No. No tsunamis were generated. And our local tsunami-warning center was clear about that. They came on several times on local radio to say that no tsunami was generated. CONAN: Let's see if we can get one more call in from Honolulu. This is Jordan(ph) calling us from Honolulu. Nice to have you on the program. JORDAN (Caller): Hello. CONAN: Hi. Go ahead, please. JORDAN: Well, all I can tell you is - as everyone else said, we have an interesting wake-up call. And then I went on a quest to try and find coffee which was, I think, I lot of people are in the same boat - which didn't happen, obviously. And then - I work in a major hotel in Waikiki and we ended up feeding probably 250 to 300 people last night with no electricity whatsoever. CONAN: And no coffee? JORDAN: And no coffee. Yeah. (Soundbite of laughter) CONAN: What an outrage! (Soundbite of laughter) JORDAN: Well, I had a splitting headache all day. That's all I can say. CONAN: Well, I hope that's going to be soon repaired, Jordan. And we'll rush coffee supplies from the mainland, if necessary. JORDAN: Well, let me tell you. It certainly could have been a lot worse. We're very fortunate. There's really no damage on Oahu whatsoever. But I can say that without electricity, we all kind of turned back into Neanderthal man pretty quickly. It's kind of a wake-up call. CONAN: Jordan, thanks very much for the call. Continued good luck to you. JORDAN: Thank you. Aloha. CONAN: Aloha. And finally, Kayla Rosenfeld, there were some problems at the airport, a lot of flights delayed. Has that been cleared up? ROSENFELD: They're still working on that. At last report, the airports were still working on backup power and the TSA officials were going through the passengers' luggage by hand. So they're still working on cleaning that up. But for the most part, the airports are operating as full as they can. CONAN: Thanks very much for being with us. We appreciate it. ROSENFELD: Thank you. Thanks for your interest. CONAN: Kayla Rosenfeld, news director at Hawaii Public Radio, with us on a phone from her office in Honolulu. We've heard a lot about the magnitude of the Hawaiian earthquake. Now put at 6. 7, by comparison the 1994 quake that hit Northridge in California was also about 6. 7 in magnitude and it was pretty devastating. You might remember the 2003 destruction of Bam, Iran, also from a quake of about the same size. Tens of thousands died there. However, despite the strength of Sunday's quake in Hawaii, there was some damage but as we've heard, no deaths. To understand why and explain what the numbers mean we turn now to Richard Harris, NPR's science correspondent, with us here in studio 3A. Hello, Richard. RICHARD HARRIS: Hello, Neal. CONAN: So is there a simple answer to this? HARRIS: Well, the simplest answer is earthquakes don't kill people; buildings kill people. And this sounds a little flip, but in fact it's true. That if you engineer buildings to withstand an earthquake that you expect to happen - and this is within the realm of expectation for Hawaii - you're not going to have very many people injured by it. And in Bam, Iraq - Iran, obviously what happened there was this old ancient stone structures that were just not engineered at all. There were just built and the stones came crumbling down and killed so many people. So that's the short answer for sure. CONAN: I think at Bam, Iran, there was also - let's not blame ancient builders, exclusively. A lot of concrete housing not built to standards. That's true. Also, the geology of the place would have to play an important part. I mean what the rocks are like in the surrounding area. HARRIS: That's absolutely true also. You mentioned the Northridge quake. That actually happened to have a very strong up and down component, much stronger than anyone had expected before. So that's why that one ended up causing a lot of damage. This one actually turned out to be, to the surprise of scientists, very much like a California quake that's a side-to-side slip, which is not what anyone would expect. It turns out it was right on the flank where the mountain that is Hawaii actually hits the sea floor. Hawaii is actually the world's tallest mountain if you measure from the sea floor as opposed from sea level. So this was right along sort of flank of the mountain there. And that also probably explains why there wasn't a tsunami, because you didn't have the right kind of ground movement for that. But clearly it generated very large seismic waves and people felt it here for quite a distance. CONAN: We're talking about the earthquake that hit Hawaii yesterday, and you're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. And Hawaii, as been mentioned, is right on a - it's right over a hot spot in the ocean and that's what in fact generated this whole sequence of islands that have become the state of Hawaii. HARRIS: That's right. It does not have the standard kind of earthquakes you get in California, where you have two giant plates rubbing against one another. And what you do have, though, is you have a lot of earthquakes associated with volcanism that's down there. And most of these earthquakes are extremely shallow. Actually, Hawaii has thousands of earthquakes a year; most are just imperceptible because they're so small. And most are very shallow, it's magma moving around and sort of jockeying for position, preparing to come out of this vent or that or just shifting underground. If enough that stress builds up after a while you get in the situation where you just sort of the earth, I don't know, I don't know if you want to call it chiropractic or something like that, but the earth sort of needs to adjust itself, and essentially that's what happens. And this was a particularly large one for Hawaii, but these are not that uncommon. Over the course of the decade or two, you expect to see earthquakes like this. And Hawaii certainly has a long history of earthquakes of about this size. CONAN: Let's see if we can get a caller on the line. Now this is Steve. Steve is calling us from Portland, Oregon. STEVE (Caller): Yes. And believe me, you might have answered my question already. But I live in the shadows of Mount St. Helens. And they use seismic activity up here to predict, you know, whether there's going to be an eruption. And my question was, how come we don't see more earthquakes in Hawaii? I took a trip to Hawaii several years ago and there was, you know, a lot of flows everywhere. I took a helicopter tour and it was everywhere. Why don't we see a lot more of this? HARRIS: Well, part of what happens is when the eruptions usually - I mean the earthquakes, I'm sorry, usually precede the eruptions. And once you have eruptions going, that means that things are flowing again. So the earthquakes actually subside during periods of eruption. The volcanic observatories up in Hawaii did of course take a very quick look to see whether there were any changes in the volcanoes, to see whether this might be predicting an eruption, and they away with the conclusion that there are essentially no changes to the volcanoes. And this was a much, much deeper earthquake than they would expect for the sorts of earthquakes that might foreshadow and earthquake - I mean, I'm sorry, a volcanic eruption. CONAN: Volcanic eruption. Steve, I could - STEVE: More to that. Just as a quick follow-up. You said that there are many earthquakes that happen in Hawaii. What magnitude do we find these at? HARRIS: Most of them are below the area of perception - twos and threes and ones and so on like that. They're all, you know, you can't really start feeling them until you're up in the area of fours of fives, depending on how close you are. So most of them are just imperceptible. CONAN: Steve, thanks very much for the call. STEVE: Okay. Thank you very much. CONAN: And on what scale is this measured. It's not the old Richter scale? HARRIS: No, they have gotten rid of the Richter scale. The Richter scale - this is sort of still loosely based on the Richter scale, so the numbers are familiar. They're more or less comparable. But this is now called the moment magnitude. A Similar kind of scale, it's also logarithmic which means that one number offers 10 times as much earthshaking as one number down. So a seven is 10 times bigger than a six and so on in terms of earth movement. But yeah, they've dropped the word Richter pretty much and they now just call this particular measurement as the moment magnitude or the preliminary magnitude. CONAN: Let's see if we can get one last caller on. This is Jennifer. Jennifer calling us from Maui. JENNIFER (Caller): Hi. My name is Jennifer and I teach ceramics and pottery classes both at this Hui No'eau Visual Arts Center on Maui, a non-profit art center, and at Maui Community College. And we have checked greenware, which is the name for unfired pottery. It's the most fragile stage that that pottery is ever at. It's the stage where it's bone dry but not yet fired. And so we've checked all the shelves in Hui No'eau Visual Arts Center ceramic studio and also at the Maui Community College art studio, and to my knowledge there was one pot from each studio that fell off during the earthquake and broke itself spontaneously against the cement floor. And that was the only damage that either of these pottery studios has suffered. CONAN: Those must have been well-engineered pottery studios, Jennifer. Thanks very much for the call. We appreciate it. JENNIFER: All right. Thank you. CONAN: Good, I'm glad everybody got out all right, Richard. And again, a tribute to quality engineering. HARRIS: Indeed, yes. CONAN: Richard Harris, NPR science correspondent, who joined us here in Studio 3A. As developments warrant, we'll have more on NPR News. This is TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. I'm Neal Conan in Washington.  NEAL CONAN, host:  This is TALK OF THE NATION. I'm Neal Conan in Washington.  Tomorrow on TALK OF THE NATION, part two in our series America at 300 million. If you're married for the first time ever, you're now in the minority. That reflects a cultural shift that will affect all us Americans. The unmarried majority and what it means to us. Plus the world's first female space tourist. That's tomorrow on TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.  Right now an update on the earthquake that struck Hawaii over the weekend. It was the strongest quake to hit the islands in more than two decades - magnitude 6. 7. We'll talk more about what those numbers mean in just a couple of minutes.  The epicenter was on the west coast of the big island - Hawaii. The quake caused blackouts and landslides, and it's taking awhile to restore power in many areas and officials are inspecting bridges and roads for damage. So far, though, no deaths have been reported as a result of the quake.  If you're in Hawaii and are able to hear this program, we'd like to hear from you. What happened where you live? Is there damage in your area? Give us a call, 800-989-8255, 800-989-TALK. E-mail us: talk@npr. org.  To talk more about the situation in Hawaii we're joined now by Kayla Rosenfeld, news director at Hawaii Public Radio. She joins us by phone from her office in Honolulu. And thanks very much for being with us today.  KAYLA ROSENFELD: It's a pleasure, Neal. Thank you.  CONAN: And I understand people who might ordinarily hear this program on Hawaii Public Radio are not hearing it.  ROSENFELD: Well, actually, luckily to say, they are hearing it. We have had our power restored. It came on about 7:15 this morning. So, yes, we do have an audience.  CONAN: Well, congratulations. Last time we talked to you it was still off. So are people around the islands getting their power back too?  ROSENFELD: Yes. The majority of the islands has received restored electrical power, but there are pockets that are still out. And a recent conversation with the Hawaiian Electric spokesman said that they're bringing the power grid up little by little so that they do not overload the system.  CONAN: Now this happened I guess about 7 a. m. Sunday morning your time. Did you realize right away it was an earthquake?  ROSENFELD: Yes. It was pretty obvious. The world shook around us.  CONAN: What happened? Where were you?  ROSENFELD: I was in bed, as were many people. But I did speak with others who had been in their kitchens or in a certain part of the house. And they described really feeling the earth shake. The first was a good, solid shake. The first quake at 7:08. The second aftershock that came about eight minutes later people described as sort of a wave. They could feel like the earth sort of swish underneath them.  CONAN: Swish underneath them. This is an unusual development. I gather there are earthquakes all the time in Hawaii, or frequently, but not this big.  ROSENFELD: Not this big. That's correct. Tremors are felt simply because we are, you know, in a plate tectonic hotspot. But this one was pretty significant.  CONAN: We've got a caller on the line from Honolulu. This is Mary. Mary's calling us from Honolulu. Nice to have you with us Mary.  MARY (CALLER): Thank you.  CONAN: And what was it like for you?  MARY: Well, I'm on the windward side of Oahu and I had just gotten up and was about ready to make a pot of coffee and I heard it coming. It sounded like a rumbling, like a low-flying jet or something like that. And then it went on for quite awhile. And then when it hit, my whole house just - the walls - like I -the roof creaked and I had some pictures and things that fell off of my bookshelf and - I mean that's the strongest.  We had one a couple of months in Kailua, and that was by far 10-times stronger than what we had. And my dogs were just totally freaking out. I tried to get them to go outside because I figured if things started falling, I have a yard at least we could be out in the open. And I mean it was very strong. Everything was moving. And then it was - as soon as it happened I went outside to see if anybody else had come out in the street and it was just eerily quiet. It was almost surreal. And then within like 30 seconds, all these car alarms started going off.  CONAN: Shaken by the motion, yeah.  MARY: Yeah. And one by one, people started coming out of their houses. And then like 5 minutes later, the power just went off. Although, I understand that wasn't because of the earthquake, that was a safety measure. And\u2026  CONAN: Everybody okay, Mary?  MARY: Yeah, we're okay. It was just kind of scary and it took - we didn't get our power back until about 1:00 a. m.  CONAN: Hmm. And let me ask you, Kayla Rosenfeld. Pretty scary, very strange but nobody got hurt. That seems to be the experience throughout the island.  ROSENFELD: That is correct. There were no significant reported injuries. Most of the damage was structural damage to buildings. There were a couple of sinkholes reported on the big island of Hawaii, but no physical damage to people.  CONAN: Mary, have things returned to normal?  MARY: Yeah, pretty much. There were still a lot of traffic late south. Getting into work this morning was kind of interesting. But in reality, what I saw is the community kind of coming together. I saw a lot of kids playing on the streets in, you know, neighborhoods that you'd never see kids out on the streets, you know, because they're inside playing Nintendo or people are watching TV. I mean it was - I actually really enjoyed not having power. It was kind of an interesting experience. Everybody came together. I talked to people I probably would not have normally talked to. So in a way I think a lot of good came out of it. It was - I know it was scary but I think, you know, it kind of bonded us as a community as well.  CONAN: Hmm. Thanks very much, Mary. Good luck to you.  MARY: Thanks.  CONAN: Kayla Rosenfeld, as people look at the damage that was inflicted on buildings and roads and highways, obviously Hawaii is one of those places where people plan for this sort of thing?  ROSENFELD: Yes. We do plan for this sort of thing, but, you know, like any community, you can never be ready for a natural disaster like this. There's always something that could have been done differently.  CONAN: And could have been done better.  ROSENFELD: And better, yes.  CONAN: Let's see if we can get another caller on the line. And let's go to - this is Vince(ph). Vince in Pahala, I hope I'm pronouncing that correctly.  VINCE (Caller): Yes. Yes. Good morning, Neal. How are you?  CONAN: Good to - I'm well. Thank you. Good afternoon here in Washington, but go ahead.  VINCE: Yes. It's still morning here. Yeah, it was an interesting, interesting wake-up call yesterday morning.  CONAN: Hah. What happened?  VINCE: About a little after 7:00, 7:10 I guess. And I was actually just settling in, listen to the NPR in the morning. And all of a sudden, you know - we always get these small tremors. We live about 11 miles from the volcano, so they think it's kind of average. But then it started up and it just kept increasing. And then the next thing I know, the coffee jumped out of the cup. This was the first one I've ever felt like I couldn't walk because everything was shaking so much.  CONAN: And did you follow all the advice that we've heard all these years to get to a, you know, the strongest part of the structure, maybe a door?  VINCE: No. Actually, it just - it seems like it just happened so fast. Like I said, even walking was difficult. And the homes down here, the old plantation homes are all post and pier, so they just kind of dance around on top. It' not - they're not directly connected with the ground at all by foundations. You know, no basements at all on these. So they seem to have bounced around pretty well, but they survived pretty well because of that as well.  CONAN: So no big damage where you live?  VINCE: No, nothing at all - thankfully with the house and no one in the community was hurt. Just a couple of lamps, but nothing that wasn't replaceable.  CONAN: Congratulations, Vince, you made it.  VINCE: Yeah. Yeah. Nothing like living in paradise.  CONAN: I suppose not. Thanks very much for the call.  VINCE: Thank you.  CONAN: And, Kayla, as you look around and as you get reports back in from the government throughout the day today, obviously getting power up is going to be a problem in some areas in, I guess bridges, highways are going to be inspected for damage. What's the biggest problem people anticipate?  ROSENFELD: Well, right now I'd say that we're just sort of wrapping up morning rush hour, and there have been some issues with the traffic lights still not being operational. They're flashing and the police have suggested that people treat the intersections as four-way intersections. Mostly that's it here on Oahu. On the neighbor islands of course there are the issues of cleaning away boulders and there were some landslides. As I mention, there was a sinkhole. So really just examining the condition of the roads.  CONAN: And did the quake generate any tsunamis?  ROSENFELD: No. No tsunamis were generated. And our local tsunami-warning center was clear about that. They came on several times on local radio to say that no tsunami was generated.  CONAN: Let's see if we can get one more call in from Honolulu. This is Jordan(ph) calling us from Honolulu. Nice to have you on the program.  JORDAN (Caller): Hello.  CONAN: Hi. Go ahead, please.  JORDAN: Well, all I can tell you is - as everyone else said, we have an interesting wake-up call. And then I went on a quest to try and find coffee which was, I think, I lot of people are in the same boat - which didn't happen, obviously. And then - I work in a major hotel in Waikiki and we ended up feeding probably 250 to 300 people last night with no electricity whatsoever.  CONAN: And no coffee?  JORDAN: And no coffee. Yeah.  (Soundbite of laughter)  CONAN: What an outrage!  (Soundbite of laughter)  JORDAN: Well, I had a splitting headache all day. That's all I can say.  CONAN: Well, I hope that's going to be soon repaired, Jordan. And we'll rush coffee supplies from the mainland, if necessary.  JORDAN: Well, let me tell you. It certainly could have been a lot worse. We're very fortunate. There's really no damage on Oahu whatsoever. But I can say that without electricity, we all kind of turned back into Neanderthal man pretty quickly. It's kind of a wake-up call.  CONAN: Jordan, thanks very much for the call. Continued good luck to you.  JORDAN: Thank you. Aloha.  CONAN: Aloha. And finally, Kayla Rosenfeld, there were some problems at the airport, a lot of flights delayed. Has that been cleared up?  ROSENFELD: They're still working on that. At last report, the airports were still working on backup power and the TSA officials were going through the passengers' luggage by hand. So they're still working on cleaning that up. But for the most part, the airports are operating as full as they can.  CONAN: Thanks very much for being with us. We appreciate it.  ROSENFELD: Thank you. Thanks for your interest.

He is Lester Crawford, and NPR's Joanne Silberner has followed his tenure, and she's with me now. First of all, what was Lester Crawford charged with? JOANNE SILBERNER: He was charged with two misdemeanors. One was making a false writing and the other was conflict of interest. Now in the making a false writing, what that was was multiple charges of claiming that Lester Crawford had sold certain stocks or gotten rid of stock options when he actually hadn't, he'd hung on to them, and also that he didn't report income from certain stocks, and that was all in companies he wasn't supposed to own in the first place. There's a rule about having a financial interest in things that you regulate when you're head of the FDA, and the FDA regulates a whole lot. And the companies were companies like PepsiCo, food distributor SYSCO, veterinary biotech company Embrex, all companies that have a lot of dealings with the FDA. And on conflict of interest, he was head of the FDA's obesity working group, which was supposed to come up with ways to cut down on America's obesity problems, and that can actually go against the best financial interest of some of the companies in which he had holdings. SIEGEL: If they manufacture snack food, for example. SILBERNER: Absolutely. SIEGEL: Does it amount to a conflict of interest? SILBERNER: Well, you know, it's hard to see right now whether his holdings affected his judgment. It certainly meets the definition of conflict of interest. You know, did he act in a certain way because he was going to make some more money off of the stocks? It's hard to prove. The court document notes clearly that the obesity working group that he headed did ask companies to state that they show how much the food calorie counts truly were rather than just how much per serving. But the agency never actually went so far as to require that, which actually could have caused people to take a double take when you see that that 20 ounce bottle of pop is 225 calories instead of the 100 calories from much less than that, which they say it all you're going to drink. Many nutrition groups say that the obesity working group could've done a lot more that you know, it couldn't done a lot more to come up with ways to cut calories and also to regulate food safety a little more tightly. SIEGEL: Now this news today of the charges against Lester Crawford, this amounts to a bit of punctuation after a rather short but complicated story of his tenure at the FDA. SILBERNER: Yeah. He went through a lot to get confirmed, and when he resigned two and a half months after he got confirmed, a lot of people were surprised. I mean, the initial holdup had more to do with issues of selling emergency contraception over the counter, but at the time there were allegations that were never proven about a questionable relationship with a female colleague, questions back then about whether he had sold all the stock he should have. Some of those questions are coming up in this statement. It was a tough battle, six months long. He stuck it out, he was confirmed, he resigned two and a half months later saying it was time to step aside. SIEGEL: So what happens next? SILBERNER: Dr. Crawford has a 2:00 p. m. court appointment in Washington tomorrow with a U. S. magistrate. The Associated Press is saying he's going to plead guilty to two misdemeanors. That could give him a prison sentence of up to two years, and there's an investigation ongoing at the Department of Health and Human Services, as well. SIEGEL: Thank you, NPR's Joanne Silberner. SILBERNER: Thank you.  ROBERT SIEGEL, host:  The former head of the Food and Drug Administration has been charged with lying about his financial interest in companies regulated by the FDA. He is Lester Crawford, and NPR's Joanne Silberner has followed his tenure, and she's with me now. First of all, what was Lester Crawford charged with?  JOANNE SILBERNER: He was charged with two misdemeanors. One was making a false writing and the other was conflict of interest. Now in the making a false writing, what that was was multiple charges of claiming that Lester Crawford had sold certain stocks or gotten rid of stock options when he actually hadn't, he'd hung on to them, and also that he didn't report income from certain stocks, and that was all in companies he wasn't supposed to own in the first place. There's a rule about having a financial interest in things that you regulate when you're head of the FDA, and the FDA regulates a whole lot. And the companies were companies like PepsiCo, food distributor SYSCO, veterinary biotech company Embrex, all companies that have a lot of dealings with the FDA.  And on conflict of interest, he was head of the FDA's obesity working group, which was supposed to come up with ways to cut down on America's obesity problems, and that can actually go against the best financial interest of some of the companies in which he had holdings.  SIEGEL: If they manufacture snack food, for example.  SILBERNER: Absolutely.  SIEGEL: Does it amount to a conflict of interest?  SILBERNER: Well, you know, it's hard to see right now whether his holdings affected his judgment. It certainly meets the definition of conflict of interest. You know, did he act in a certain way because he was going to make some more money off of the stocks? It's hard to prove. The court document notes clearly that the obesity working group that he headed did ask companies to state that they show how much the food calorie counts truly were rather than just how much per serving. But the agency never actually went so far as to require that, which actually could have caused people to take a double take when you see that that 20 ounce bottle of pop is 225 calories instead of the 100 calories from much less than that, which they say it all you're going to drink.  Many nutrition groups say that the obesity working group could've done a lot more that you know, it couldn't done a lot more to come up with ways to cut calories and also to regulate food safety a little more tightly.  SIEGEL: Now this news today of the charges against Lester Crawford, this amounts to a bit of punctuation after a rather short but complicated story of his tenure at the FDA.  SILBERNER: Yeah. He went through a lot to get confirmed, and when he resigned two and a half months after he got confirmed, a lot of people were surprised. I mean, the initial holdup had more to do with issues of selling emergency contraception over the counter, but at the time there were allegations that were never proven about a questionable relationship with a female colleague, questions back then about whether he had sold all the stock he should have. Some of those questions are coming up in this statement. It was a tough battle, six months long. He stuck it out, he was confirmed, he resigned two and a half months later saying it was time to step aside.  SIEGEL: So what happens next?  SILBERNER: Dr. Crawford has a 2:00 p. m. court appointment in Washington tomorrow with a U. S. magistrate. The Associated Press is saying he's going to plead guilty to two misdemeanors. That could give him a prison sentence of up to two years, and there's an investigation ongoing at the Department of Health and Human Services, as well.  SIEGEL: Thank you, NPR's Joanne Silberner.

Good morning. I'm Steve Inskeep. LINDA WERTHEIMER, host: And I'm Linda Wertheimer. Residents on the Gulf Coast are well aware of what happens when a hurricane comes ashore. When it reaches land, the storm comes to a violent end. (Soundbite of wind) Mr. MIKE HODGE(ph) (Virginia Beach): Lots of wind. Lots of debris. We've just seen the side of the hotel get ripped off. It's real choppy. I see pieces of pier floating all over the place, from the pier getting torn up. WERTHEIMER: That was Mike Hodge in Virginia Beach describing Hurricane Isabel in 2003. The scene marked the end of Isabel's life. (Soundbite of waves) WERTHEIMER: The beginning took place several weeks earlier and several thousand miles away on the other side of the Atlantic. Isabel took shape near the Cape Verde Islands, several hundred miles off the coast of Africa. The same waters produced Andrew in 1992 and Frances in 2004. Storms from this area are called Cape Verde Hurricanes. They tend to form in the summer and fall, so during this hurricane season a group of scientists spent a month in Cape Verde. NPR's Jon Hamilton followed them on their quest to learn more about the birth of a hurricane. JON HAMILTON: Cape Verde is a republic of ten small islands, known for surf, sun and a melancholy style of music that blends the sounds of Portugal and Africa. (Soundbite of music) Unidentified Woman (Singer): (Singing) (Foreign language spoken) HAMILTON: Tourists come to the island of Sal for a quick tan. So it's easy to spot the hurricane scientists at the hotel bar. They're the pasty ones talking about lidar data and mesoscale convective systems. They don't spend much time on the beach. You're more likely to find them flying over it in a DC-8 airliner that serves as a sort of laboratory with wings. Ms. ROBBIE HOOD (Scientist, NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center): We're skimming the top of the ocean right now. Unidentified Man #1: It's not too often you see a DC-8 flying this low. (Soundbite of laughter) HAMILTON: Robbie Hood came from NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville. She's one of about 30 people on today's flight. Dozens more are working on the ground. They're all part of a NASA mission to learn why some storms evolve into hurricanes. The NASA team has been stationed in Cape Verde for more than three weeks. They've got only a few days left and Hood says they still need a lot more data. Ms. HOOD: It's kind of like a jigsaw puzzle. There are certain pieces that we're putting together. And we've got part of the picture of, you know, how a hurricane is developed, but we don't have the complete picture yet. HAMILTON: Cape Verde hurricanes begin as atmospheric disturbances called easterly waves that appear over Africa. Some of these waves have actually become hurricanes as the trade winds carried them across the Atlantic. Others just disappear. It's not clear why. Gerry Heymsfield of NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland says the wave we're following is typical. He points to a satellite image on his laptop. Mr. GERRY HEYMSFIELD (NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center): This here is just a very big group of thunderstorms. It's maybe 100, 200 miles across. HAMILTON: The scientists and technicians on board will spend the next seven hours flying in and around those thunderstorms. They'll measure wind sheer, convection, rotation, lightning, rainfall, humidity, even the dust particles swirling about. All of these things may help decide whether a storm grows into a hurricane. Once the plane reaches altitude, NASA team members unbuckle their seatbelts and spring into action. Ms. HOOD: Hey, Mike! Mike, come here. HAMILTON: Hood is scanning satellite images to decide which flight pattern will produce the best picture of the storm. Ms. HOOD: \u2026but, you know, in these (unintelligible) we're starting to get into the convection more. And there's a little bit of lightning right there. I was wondering if\u2026 HAMILTON: This DC-8 was designed to carry 150 passengers, but many rows of seats have been replaced by racks of equipment. They hold lasers, radars, radiometers, particle collectors and lots of computers. A walk down the aisle lets you visit a dozen meteorology labs in about as many steps. The air is filled with jargon. Ms. HOOD: My job is running this instrument called a CVI, a counter-flow virtual impactor. Unidentified Man #2: Yeah. Plus we were looking at the Saharan dust layer between one\u2026 (Soundbite of buzzer) Unidentified Man #3: Not a perfect drop, but it's good enough to use. Unidentified Woman #2: Basically I'm just providing the displays of the (unintelligible) data, the lidar data. Professor ROBERT PASKEN (Professor of Meteorology, St. Louis University): We've lost the sondes and we've got to go drop another one. HAMILTON: Near the back of the plane, a bearded man swivels between a computer screen and what looks like a small torpedo tube jutting up through the floor. Prof. PASKEN: I'm Dr. Robert Pasken from St. Louis University, and I'm an associate professor there. HAMILTON: Pasken is launching dropsondes. They're cylinders about the size of a model rocket, but jammed with electronics. As they fall, they send back data on atmospheric pressure, temperature, humidity and wind direction. Pasken says there's one question on everyone's mind right now Prof. PASKEN: And the question is will this storm turn into a hurricane? Nobody's ever seen the genesis before, or at least studied it in detail as much as we are. HAMILTON: Today's storm system is rotating counterclockwise the way a hurricane does. But it's weak and disorganized. Probably not a baby hurricane. So the mood is subdued when the plane finally touches down after dark. The team has just two flights left and they still haven't found what they came for. The pilot, Bill Brockett, holds a post-flight briefing. He talks about some of the obstacles the crew encountered during the flight. Mr. BILL BROCKETT (Pilot): Sal is absolutely up to speed, whereas Dakar, they just aren't able to deal with it I think is the problem. HAMILTON: Brocket says it's not easy to chase a storm system through airspace controlled by several different countries. Mr. BROCKETT: Well, that's all I have, folks. I guess I'll see you all in the living room. (Soundbite of laughter) HAMILTON: There's just time to make it back to the hotel for dinner. After that, there's a stage show featuring Cape Verdean dancers and a Michael Jackson impersonator. But by that time most of the scientists have gone to grab a few hours sleep. (Soundbite of waves) HAMILTON: By noon the next day, the team is airborne again. There's tension on this flight. The mission was put together on a tight budget. Now it's running short on flight time and supplies, and still no baby hurricane. Bob Pasken has started rationing dropsondes. Prof. PASKEN: We've got 33 sondes left and we have three flights - this one and two others. So rather than try and use them all up on one storm, we're trying something new today. HAMILTON: Instead of dropping a sonde, the pilot drops the entire plane from 30,000 feet to 500 feet. There's turbulence, coffee spills, scientists lurch around the cabin, backpacks and briefcases have to be tied down. About four hours into the flight, Robbie Hood decides this storm system just isn't worth it. She orders an early return. Ms. HOOD: This will probably be the last day that we work this storm because the forecast is showing something bigger coming off the coast in a few days. And that'll probably be our last case of this mission. HAMILTON: Back on the ground, Hood explains why missions like this one are important. For one thing, they're a way to improve hurricane forecasting in the U. S. But the biggest payoff may be in countries that are less prepared for powerful storms. Hood says people in the states tend to think of 2005 only in terms of Hurricane Katrina. Ms. HOOD: But also there was Hurricane Stan last year that flared up on the eastern side of the Yucatan. It flared up very quickly, moved inland to Guatemala. And actually I think officially the hurricane itself, the death toll may have been 80 but there was close to 800 to 1,000 people who were covered in mudslides because of the heavy rain. HAMILTON: Hood says if scientists can learn to spot Cape Verde hurricanes sooner, that could give people in places like Guatemala more time to prepare. On their last flight of the mission, Hood and the rest of the team finally got what they came for. They followed a baby storm system that went on to become a hurricane named Helene.

RICHARD GONZALES: Since ancient times, fish have been used to monitor water quality, but you wouldn't know there's a problem with the water supply until you saw fish floating dead. And by that time, you might not be feeling so well yourself. It's important to detect the presence of toxins early, before the fish get sick and die. And that's where a device designed by a small company outside San Diego comes in. It really is, you can see there's not much to it. I mean the stars of the show are really right here, the bluegill. GONZALES: I'm standing with Bill Lawler, a co-founder of Intelligent Automation Corporation, or IAC, a small high-tech firm in Poway, California. He's pointing at a small aquarium gussied up with tubes, cables and a computer. Eight freshwater bluegills about the size of your index fingers swim in individual chambers not much bigger than a pack of cigarettes. Mr. BILL LAWLER (Intelligent Automation Corporation): Now, you can see above and below the fish here, we have these carbon sensors. And what those are doing, are they're really detecting the tiny electrical signals the fish generate as they breathe and swim. And you can see them turn around in the chamber and do things like that. GONZALES: The electrical signals are amplified and sent to the computer, where you can read the fish movements like an EKG. Mr. LAWLER: You can see right here there's a - examples of the fish -normal breathing patterns, and that's actually a cough right there. GONZALES: You say the fish coughs? Mr. LAWLER: The fish coughs, yeah. There's a little peak right here in the signal that you can tell that he coughs.

In San Francisco, one of the city's top water officials, Michael Carlin, will say that fish are great watchdogs and can pick up even minute variations in water quality. Mr. MICHAEL CARLIN (Water Official, San Francisco): We're looking for those variations and whether or not they're just a minor variation in water quality or a true terrorist threat, it's much more sophisticated than just the Roman era when they just would look at the fish and see if they would die or not.

Recently we reported that scientists have figured out how to make objects invisible, not to the human eye, mind you, just invisible to some kinds of electromagnetic radiation. It was theory then. Now they've done it. And while it's not ready for market yet, you can just see the possibilities. NPR's Christopher Joyce has more. CHRISTOPHER JOYCE: Yes, it actually works. That's what the team from Duke University now says. It is a small disc-shaped device made of special composite materials embedded with tiny rods and rings, kind of like microchips on a donut. What it does is cloak itself from microwave radiation. The radiation slips by like water around a smooth rock. So let's say you're from another planet and you see using the microwave part of electromagnetic spectrum instead of the visual part we use; this thing would fool you. Well, not completely. If you saw the movie The Predator, you'd remember that when the creature disappeared, it still cast a kind of shimmery shadow. The Duke device still has a shadow problem, but they have declared victory in this week's issue of the journal Science. They say what works for microwaves might work for things like radar, or even someday 12-year-old wizards named Harry sneaking around after his bedtime. Christopher Joyce, NPR News.  WERTHEIMER: And now for the last word in business. Recently we reported that scientists have figured out how to make objects invisible, not to the human eye, mind you, just invisible to some kinds of electromagnetic radiation. It was theory then. Now they've done it. And while it's not ready for market yet, you can just see the possibilities.  NPR's Christopher Joyce has more.  CHRISTOPHER JOYCE: Yes, it actually works. That's what the team from Duke University now says. It is a small disc-shaped device made of special composite materials embedded with tiny rods and rings, kind of like microchips on a donut. What it does is cloak itself from microwave radiation. The radiation slips by like water around a smooth rock. So let's say you're from another planet and you see using the microwave part of electromagnetic spectrum instead of the visual part we use; this thing would fool you. Well, not completely. If you saw the movie The Predator, you'd remember that when the creature disappeared, it still cast a kind of shimmery shadow.

I'm sorry, but they have determined the complete genetic sequence of the honeybee. Researchers, now these days, are probing some mysteries of the bee's existence, such as how a bee's genes control its behavior. NPR's Joe Palca has more. JOE PALCA: Quick biology refresher: DNA is a long double-stranded molecule. Along each strand are letters; or more properly, base pairs. The sequence of the letters tells you about an animal's genetic makeup. The totality of the letters makes up the animal's genome. Professor KIM WORLEY (Genome Sequencing, Baylor College of Medicine): To sequence a genome, we start by chopping it into little pieces. PALCA: Kim Worley, of Baylor College of Medicine, is one of the leaders of the consortium that sequenced the honeybee genome. Prof. WORLEY: The pieces of sequence are usually on the order of 800 base pairs or so. PALCA: An automated sequencing machine spits out the sequence for each piece. Worley says there are about 300 million letters, or base pairs in the honeybee genome. And remember, each little piece is only about 800 letters. Prof. WORLEY: So there's a lot of little pieces that need to go together to get the whole genome put together. PALCA: But that's what Worley and colleagues were able to do. Their complete honeybee genome sequence appears in the journal Nature. Entomologist Gene Robinson, at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champagne, says there are a number of reasons scientists are interested in the genes of honeybees. Professor GENE ROBINSON (University of Illinois, Urbana-Champagne): They are really important in the environment. They are premier pollinator on earth, so in the United States alone, some 10 to $20 billion worth of food per year is attributable to their pollination activities. And then, in the biological sciences, they're important models in a variety of different fields. PALCA: One of those fields is the genetics of behavior. Bees have a complex social organization. Robinson says with the genome sequence in hand, scientists can study how genes change their activity depending on what a bee is up to. Prof. ROBINSON: We've compared the brains of nurse bees and foragers, and find 40 percent of the genes show differences in activity. Forty percent, which is a striking number, especially when you think that a nurse will grow up and become a forager. PALCA: Robinson says a honeybee's gene switch on and off depending on what the bee is doing. In other words, genes are responding to the bee's environment. Prof. ROBINSON: Just as behavior is dynamic, just as the brain is dynamic, also the genome is dynamic. PALCA: Robinson's study of the genetics of a bee's brain and behavior appears in the journal Science. Also in Science is a paper by Charles Whitfield, of the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champagne, that uses the genome to investigate where the first honeybee came from. It turns out that, like humans, honeybees came out of Africa. But when Whitfield and his colleagues compared the genetics of two subspecies of honeybee - one from Eastern Europe and the other from the West - they found something surprising. Professor CHARLES WHITFIELD (University of Illinois, Urbana-Champagne): Those two groups were genetically very distant from each other. In fact, each of those groups was more similar to African honeybees than they were to each other. PALCA: Whitfield says the best way to explain this is, two separate ancient exoduses, one that headed toward Western Europe. Prof. WHITFIELD: Probably via Morocco and Spain. And you've got one that got into Eastern Europe. And that one probably got there through the Near East. PALCA: There was a third major exodus of honeybees out of Africa; that one occurred quite recently. In 1956, the so-called African, or Killer honeybee, was brought to Brazil. And those honeybees have been spreading their genes northward ever since. Joe Palca, NPR News, Washington. STAMBERG: Steve, do you know how to scare a bee? INSKEEP: No. STAMBERG: Boo, bee.

So it's no surprise that she grew up to be skeptical of the idea of life after death, whether it's the soul's passage to heaven, reincarnation into another being, or the channeling of departed loved one's messages through a medium. And in her most recent book, Spook, Mary Roach puts these beliefs about the afterlife to the test, seeking out those who are searching for scientific proof of, among other things, things like the soul or reincarnation or near-death out-of-body experiences, the dead communicating with the living. Where is the scientific proof for that? Well, Mary Roach went and looked for the scientific proof. And we're going to talk with her about what science has to say about the afterlife and whether the search for proof has changed her belief. Our number is 1-800-989-8255. As I say, Mary Roach is the author of Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife, just out in paperback from Norton. And her previous book is Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers. She joins us today from Oakland, California. Welcome to the program. Ms. MARY ROACH (Author, Spook): Thank you so much. FLATOW: What was your belief about the afterlife before you got into this? Ms. ROACH: Well, I had a hard time buying that it was going to be one of the classic cloud scenes with the gates and all that because it just didn't seem - it didn't seem logical. I guess I had a sense that it would pretty much be lights out, that's it, the billion year nap, that sort of thing. It was kind of depressing. But that's pretty much what - if I had to put my money on it, that's kind of what I thought. But I was still holding out hope. FLATOW: And you went out and actually tried to find scientists who were looking to prove one way or the other whether these things exist? Ms. ROACH: I did. I got interested in this when I was working on Stiff. I came across this physician from around the turn of the last century, Duncan MacDougall, who is the man behind 21 grams. In other words, he's a soul weigher. He was this ordinary rather conservative physician who got this idea in his head that if you put someone onto a scale, onto a bed on top of a scale and you had them there as they died and you watched the needle, the needle - you know, if the needle went down a little bit as they died, the moment they died, well, by golly, that might mean the soul was departing the body. And I just loved - I mean, it's not a terribly precise experiment, but it's - I just loved that can-do spirit. You know, we can take science. We can take the scientific method. And we can apply it to something, you know, as ethereal as a soul. So I wanted to find out more about him. And he has his own chapter. Well, actually he shares it with three or four other soul weighers, some of them actually contemporary. Still trying to pin it down that way. FLATOW: One of my favorite chapters in your book is how you try to investigate the out-of-body experience or people who were near-death, the near-death experiencing looking down on themselves. Ms. ROACH: Yes. FLATOW: And you find a doctor with TV monitors on a ceiling. Ms. ROACH: Yeah, that's actually going on now at the University of Virginia. And it's a collaboration between the psychology department and, believe it or not, the cardiology department. There's this lab where they put defibrillators into patients' chests. And in order to test the defibrillators you need to essentially flatline the patients and then have the defibrillator kick-start their heart. So that's a good group of people to use for a near-death experience study. So in this operating room where they do this, you know, intentional flat lining of patients, rendering them clinically dead just momentarily, there's a computer taped up on the very highest monitor. It's a laptop computer. And it's flat open so that the only way you could see the image that's on it is if you were a disembodied consciousness hovering up there, or possibly a janitor changing a light bulb. I don't know. FLATOW: Wait. Just hold that thought, Mary, because we're going to keep our -hold that thought with bated breath because we're going to have to take a break. We'll come back and you can tell us the rest of what happened in that story and your book, Spook. So stay with us. We'll be right back after this short break. I'm Ira Flatow. This is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. (Soundbite of music) You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow. We're talking this hour with Mary Roach, author of Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife. It's out in paperback from Norton. And you may remember her former book, Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers, published also by Norton. Coming to close to Halloween, talking about life after death and the scientists that actually are out there investigating these life after death experiences. And before we talk more about it, Mary was telling me about this one experiment that a scientist was conducting with out-of-body experience where - pickup this story, where there were monitors on the ceiling. Ms. ROACH: Sure. That was a very dramatic part. But yes, anyway, the monitor that's a computer, a laptop computer, was one of 12, I believe it's 12, images is randomly chosen to be displayed on this laptop computer. And it's facing the ceiling. In other words, the only way you could see the image is if you were hovering up there as people often report when they have the kind of near-death experience that includes an out-of-body experience. So and then after they come out of the operating room, Dr. Greyson's the psychologist running the program, he just asks them a couple questions, essentially, do you remember anything of your time in the operating room? Unfortunately one component of the anesthesia is it's something that makes you forget. So he's having difficulty. So far nobody has reported seeing the image on the computer, which is terribly disappointing for me because I was very excited about this study, though I realized recently that in my book I mentioned the images that appear on the computer. So if one day somebody actually -FLATOW: A frog, a butterfly. Ms. ROACH:  -says I saw a horse then someone else can come back and say, you just read Mary Roach's book. You did not see a horse. FLATOW: You've wrecked all those studies going on. Ms. ROACH: I did. I still -FLATOW: That's what you'll be famous for, not your books but you wrecked all the - how did the scientists - are the scientists laughed at at these universities where they, you know, I'm doing the study -Ms. ROACH: Yes. I think they are politely behind their backs laughed at at a place like the University of Virginia. In fact, the new president there has told Dr. Greyson that he doesn't want him talking about his paranormal work anymore. So the fact that I'm here on NPR discussing this experiment, rather out there experiment going on at the University of Virginia is not at all what they want to have happen. But yeah, it's very tough. It's - you don't go into this field these days without risking certain stain on your reputation, I guess. FLATOW: Yeah. How do you explain some of these shows we've seen on TV where, you know, I think it's Crossing Over with John Edwards or people like that who are able to communicate with dead of relatives? But - and it seems to be so true, things they come up with, you know. Ms. ROACH: Right. You know, I have not seen John Edwards's show in particular but I watched a television show, sort of an expose about a year ago. And I don't know which show it was but the way they were doing it was they have a line of people waiting to be in the studio audience. And in that line are a number of plants, people who work for the show. And in the - you know, while they're just chatting on line and having what seems to be ordinary conversations they are revealing some things about themselves. And the plants are making a note of that and then sort of subtly mark the leg of the chair of a number of these people. And that was - that was a technique that I heard about. FLATOW: And -Ms. ROACH: But I know what - go ahead. FLATOW: No. Go ahead. I'm sorry. Ms. ROACH: I was going to say, if you're working with a large group of people and you start out, you know, I'm getting the letter C. Well, all right, there's going to be quite a number of people out there, you know, gray haired woman letter C. And someone's going to raise their hand. And you work from there. It's much easier to do a mass group cold reading than it is a one on one. So in a sense it might be easier to do it that way. FLATOW: And in fact you uncover a lot of the ruses used in s\u00e9ances, places like that, the slime and the ectoplasm. Ms. ROACH: Ectoplasm is a personal favorite of mine, that chapter. FLATOW: Yeah. Ms. ROACH: Yeah, Ectoplasm - the heyday of s\u00e9ances and ectoplasms was around the 1920s. And it really was amazing to me - I should try to explain ectoplasm to people, which is not easy to do. FLATOW: If you haven't seen Ghostbusters, forget about it. Ms. ROACH: Yeah, exactly. Go rent Ghostbusters. Ectoplasm was supposedly spirit energy made physical. In other words, the medium would produce, kind of exude this stuff. And it's dark in the room, remember. And this stuff seems to be coming out of the person's mouth. It's sort of like a gauzy, filmy stuff. And it was - they claimed it was - this was spirit energy that they were kind of channeling and it was a physical manifestation of the spiritual. And amazingly enough, Scientific American devoted four issues, there was a four part series on one of these ectoplasm producing mediums. It was taken very, very seriously by the scientific community in the 1920s. The Sorbonne did an investigation of a woman named Eva C. It was kind of mind blowing because when you look at the photographs, it's just - you look at it and you say my God, that's just gauze. It's cheese cloth. Come on, guys. But people fell for it because what you needed to understand how these women were doing it was you needed a magician. You needed - for example, Harry Houdini got involved in debunking one of the very famous mediums because no one else - they would search them. You know, they would search their clothing before the s\u00e9ance, actually did cavity searches. I mean, this was very thorough. And the mediums would still, they'd go in their cabinet, the curtain would open. Tada, there's the ectoplasm. They thought how are they doing it? FLATOW: Yeah. That's what the amazing James Randi has been saying for years. Bring a magician, because we know what to look for. Ms. ROACH: Yeah, exactly. But because some of these folks with Nobel Prizes and PhDs were fooled, and they spoke out saying look, we believe it's genuine, I mean, who's going to question somebody with a Nobel Prize. But in fact what you needed was a - yeah, you needed a magician to say aha, this is what they're doing. FLATOW: What's also interesting, as you point out about the confluence of the age of electricity and the turn of the last century and the rise of all these s\u00e9ances and other kinds of parapsychology. Ms. ROACH: Yeah. I was - I think that helps - for me, it made a little easier to understand how people could have accepted it. Because this was a period of time that was right after the invention of the wireless telegraph and, you know, electricity hadn't been around that long and the telephone. And people had had to accept, you know, this seeming witchery of voice flying through the ether across the country and coming out on the end of a receiver. And I think that they thought well, you know, it's not such a big leap to imagine that a medium could be sort of acting as a receiver from the beyond. And even Thomas Edison actually tried to make a receiver - actually an amplifier to amplify these little, little, teeny, tiny voices of people who had died. FLATOW: Yeah, you had some very famous scientists who in their later lives went on into the occult, you know. I think Alexander Graham Bell, people like that. Ms. ROACH: Yeah. Sir Oliver Lodge, Sir Crooks, William James. FLATOW: Yeah. Let's go to the phones. Ms. ROACH: Yeah. FLATOW: Mary in Cincinnati. Hi. Welcome to Science Friday. MARY (Caller): Hi, thanks for taking my call. FLATOW: Go ahead. MARY: Basically, I share the same skepticism and scientific approach as Mary does, and my question for her was - because I did, myself, a non-life-threatening scientific experiment of going through past life regression therapy, you know, to kind of give myself a first hand experience, and I wonder, Mary, if you, yourself, have done anything - not anything dangerous, but anything like past life regression therapy or anything like that that was a little more spiritual in nature that might give you some personal evidence? Ms. ROACH: You know, I did two things, actually. First of all, I enrolled, like a fool, in medium school in London at this venerable old spiritualist college, and I took a weekend course, thinking maybe I just don't understand how it works. I failed. FLATOW: Not a good medium, huh? Ms. ROACH: Yeah, the chapter's called Soul in a Dunce Cap. The other thing I thought about doing but did not is in the chapter on near-death experience, there is a drug called ketamine, and people report that if you take this drug, you experience an ersatz near-death experience sometimes, depending on how you take it and how much you take. And I thought, you know, without knowing much about this drug, I though oh hey, that's an idea. I'll just try ketamine. And then I read a little bit more about it, and I decided that was probably a bad idea. But I did not have myself regressed. I am regressed enough. FLATOW: There you go. Thanks, Mary, for calling. Ms. ROACH: Thank you. MARY: Thank you, thank you. FLATOW: Have a great weekend. 1-800-989-8255 is our number. Let's go to Adam in Kansas City. Hi, Adam. ADAM (Caller): Hello. FLATOW: Hi there. Ms. ROACH: Hi Adam. ADAM: Yeah. I just wondered if she had any comments on psychics helping police solve crimes, and I would think that if there was any truth to that, that there would be fairly good documentation to check up on that. Ms. ROACH: You know, there is - if you go on the Web site - I personally didn't do any research on psychic detectives, but there's a really good article on that on the Web site of the CSICOP, the Committee for Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal. That's a mouthful. Anyway, it's about -specifically, I think, about Allison DuBois, who is the medium upon whom the show Medium is based, and there is somebody who looks at her work and is not terribly impressed by it, I believe. ADAM: Okay. I was just thinking that if this is one of your endeavors, that that might be a compelling area to check out. I was wondering why you wouldn't check that out, if it might be a good source to find something out. Ms. ROACH: Well, I did spend some time in a lab where they had a few mediums coming in, but it wasn't specifically psychic detective work. I am a little bit more inclined toward the people trying to find proof or evidence in a laboratory setting, and the psychic detective work - I suppose if you had a case, yes, of somebody who had fingered - come up with the name of the murderer and the evidence, I mean, that would be pretty remarkable, but that's more of a psychic thing than a mediumship. FLATOW: Right. You're into afterlife things. Ms. ROACH: Yeah. FLATOW: Did you ever find anybody in your research who, you know, and you followed people looking for ghosts in haunted houses who had any credible evidence or any real credible, you know, data? Ms. ROACH: I think the best - the most intriguing and the hardest to dismiss is some of the studies in the realm of near-death experience, and I'll try to explain one to you. I was trying to find studies, things that took this out of the realm of anecdote, because near-death experiences, there's a tremendous number of, you know, people's stories and of anecdotes about it. But to actually set up a controlled experiment was more what I was interested in. There was one done by Michael Sabin, who's a cardiologist, and he got a group of people who'd had an out-of-body, near-death experience where they had seen themselves being resuscitated down below, and he had these people write down in as much detail as they could, what did you see exactly. And then he got a control group, and that was patients who had been in a resuscitation, they had been in emergency rooms, seen a crash cart, seen defibrillator paddles. You know, they knew what everything looked like. And he said to them okay, describe in as much detail as you can what it would look like if you were being resuscitated. And then he looked at the two groups' descriptions, and the people who'd had the near-death experience who claim to have been watching didn't make medical errors and were surprisingly detailed. I mean, it was - I read a bunch of transcripts of those reports, and you know, they would - like, there would be a man saying well, then there was a machine - you know, the needle came up, not all at once. It was on, you know, and then he named another type of meter -but, you know, it partially is part way up and it came back down, then it came back up. I mean, the level of detail is amazing. Meanwhile, the control group, you know, you had suction cups attached to defibrillators, people being pounded on the back instead of the front. I mean, it was like chimpanzees were running the emergency room. FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255. We're talking with Mary Roach, author of Spook, on TALK OF THE NATION Science Friday from NPR News. You pose an interesting question at the end of your book. Has my year among the evidence gatherers left me believing in anything I didn't believe in a year ago? Well, has it? Ms. ROACH: Oh, Ira, you're asking me to give away the end of the book. FLATOW: Sorry. You can circumlocate it, as they say. Ms. ROACH: No, you know, I will say what - I think I ended up - because I posed the same question to Bruce Greyson, who is the guy at the University of Virginia who does a lot of the near-death experience work. And I said, well, are you - do you believe? Do you - you know, seriously. Are you convinced that somebody's consciousness can actually kind of function independent of their body? I mean, do you believe that? And he said, well, what I believe is in the possibility of something that we haven't figured out yet. And that's, you know - and I would say you could describe me that way. I think - and my little, brief confused foray into quantum mechanics made me believe that there may be things we just haven't figured out. FLATOW: Right. So there can be spooky action at a distance. There could be anything. Ms. ROACH: Yeah, exactly. FLATOW: And of course, there's not a lot of federal grant money going into studying these things. Ms. ROACH: No, no. It's kind of amazing anyone is still doing this work. And the reason the University of Virginia is doing it, interestingly, they got a huge grant from Chester Carlson, the inventor of the Xerox machine, left this huge - he bequeathed - they wouldn't tell me how many millions, but enough to have kept them going for quite some time. And specifically, the money is earmarked for research into the survival of the personality at death. So they have funding. FLATOW: Well, if you know the history of Chester Carlson, you know what a terrible, difficult time he had in life. Ms. ROACH: He what? FLATOW: He had such a terrible time convincing anybody of the need to have a Xerox machine, so you know why he had such a tough life. And he left some money over for other people. So where do you go from here? Do you have anything that you want to follow up on in your book, or another book in mind on the same sort of subject? Ms. ROACH: I have another book that I'm working on. I'm kind of turning a corner. I'm leaving dead people behind. Enough with the dead people. But it's more bodies in laboratories, but it's sex research. FLATOW: Sex research. You want a real bestseller now. You can combine dead bodies and sex -Ms. ROACH: That's not why I'm doing it. FLATOW: You don't want combine - go there with the dead bodies and sex research. Ms. ROACH: No, no. FLATOW: Well, thank you very much for taking time to talk with us, and good luck to you, and have a - are you doing anything special on Halloween? Ms. ROACH: I'm doing a reading in the Haight-Ashbury, and I'm trying to figure out - I may dress up as ectoplasm, but I feel it may be too messy. FLATOW: You have to keep replenishing it then. Ms. ROACH: Yes. FLATOW: Well, Mary Roach will be dripping through Haight-Ashbury. So have a happy Halloween and thank you for joining us. Ms. ROACH: Thank you so much, Ira. FLATOW: You're welcome. Mary Roach, author of Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife. Out in paperback now from Norton, and you'll remember her last book Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers.  IRA FLATOW, host:  My next guest spent her childhood questioning the Bible stories her mother told her, figuring that the walls of Jericho fell because of a well-timed earthquake and that Jesus walked on water thanks to an offshore atoll just below the surface.  So it's no surprise that she grew up to be skeptical of the idea of life after death, whether it's the soul's passage to heaven, reincarnation into another being, or the channeling of departed loved one's messages through a medium.  And in her most recent book, Spook, Mary Roach puts these beliefs about the afterlife to the test, seeking out those who are searching for scientific proof of, among other things, things like the soul or reincarnation or near-death out-of-body experiences, the dead communicating with the living. Where is the scientific proof for that?  Well, Mary Roach went and looked for the scientific proof. And we're going to talk with her about what science has to say about the afterlife and whether the search for proof has changed her belief.  Our number is 1-800-989-8255. As I say, Mary Roach is the author of Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife, just out in paperback from Norton. And her previous book is Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers.  She joins us today from Oakland, California. Welcome to the program.  Ms. MARY ROACH (Author, Spook): Thank you so much.  FLATOW: What was your belief about the afterlife before you got into this?  Ms. ROACH: Well, I had a hard time buying that it was going to be one of the classic cloud scenes with the gates and all that because it just didn't seem - it didn't seem logical. I guess I had a sense that it would pretty much be lights out, that's it, the billion year nap, that sort of thing. It was kind of depressing. But that's pretty much what - if I had to put my money on it, that's kind of what I thought. But I was still holding out hope.  FLATOW: And you went out and actually tried to find scientists who were looking to prove one way or the other whether these things exist?  Ms. ROACH: I did. I got interested in this when I was working on Stiff. I came across this physician from around the turn of the last century, Duncan MacDougall, who is the man behind 21 grams. In other words, he's a soul weigher.  He was this ordinary rather conservative physician who got this idea in his head that if you put someone onto a scale, onto a bed on top of a scale and you had them there as they died and you watched the needle, the needle - you know, if the needle went down a little bit as they died, the moment they died, well, by golly, that might mean the soul was departing the body.  And I just loved - I mean, it's not a terribly precise experiment, but it's - I just loved that can-do spirit. You know, we can take science. We can take the scientific method. And we can apply it to something, you know, as ethereal as a soul.  So I wanted to find out more about him. And he has his own chapter. Well, actually he shares it with three or four other soul weighers, some of them actually contemporary. Still trying to pin it down that way.  FLATOW: One of my favorite chapters in your book is how you try to investigate the out-of-body experience or people who were near-death, the near-death experiencing looking down on themselves.  Ms. ROACH: Yes.  FLATOW: And you find a doctor with TV monitors on a ceiling.  Ms. ROACH: Yeah, that's actually going on now at the University of Virginia. And it's a collaboration between the psychology department and, believe it or not, the cardiology department.  There's this lab where they put defibrillators into patients' chests. And in order to test the defibrillators you need to essentially flatline the patients and then have the defibrillator kick-start their heart. So that's a good group of people to use for a near-death experience study.  So in this operating room where they do this, you know, intentional flat lining of patients, rendering them clinically dead just momentarily, there's a computer taped up on the very highest monitor. It's a laptop computer. And it's flat open so that the only way you could see the image that's on it is if you were a disembodied consciousness hovering up there, or possibly a janitor changing a light bulb. I don't know.  FLATOW: Wait. Just hold that thought, Mary, because we're going to keep our -hold that thought with bated breath because we're going to have to take a break. We'll come back and you can tell us the rest of what happened in that story and your book, Spook.  So stay with us. We'll be right back after this short break.  I'm Ira Flatow. This is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.  (Soundbite of music)  You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow.  We're talking this hour with Mary Roach, author of Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife. It's out in paperback from Norton. And you may remember her former book, Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers, published also by Norton.  Coming to close to Halloween, talking about life after death and the scientists that actually are out there investigating these life after death experiences. And before we talk more about it, Mary was telling me about this one experiment that a scientist was conducting with out-of-body experience where - pickup this story, where there were monitors on the ceiling.  Ms. ROACH: Sure. That was a very dramatic part. But yes, anyway, the monitor that's a computer, a laptop computer, was one of 12, I believe it's 12, images is randomly chosen to be displayed on this laptop computer. And it's facing the ceiling. In other words, the only way you could see the image is if you were hovering up there as people often report when they have the kind of near-death experience that includes an out-of-body experience.  So and then after they come out of the operating room, Dr. Greyson's the psychologist running the program, he just asks them a couple questions, essentially, do you remember anything of your time in the operating room?  Unfortunately one component of the anesthesia is it's something that makes you forget. So he's having difficulty. So far nobody has reported seeing the image on the computer, which is terribly disappointing for me because I was very excited about this study, though I realized recently that in my book I mentioned the images that appear on the computer.  So if one day somebody actually - FLATOW: A frog, a butterfly.  Ms. ROACH:  -says I saw a horse then someone else can come back and say, you just read Mary Roach's book. You did not see a horse.  FLATOW: You've wrecked all those studies going on.  Ms. ROACH: I did. I still - FLATOW: That's what you'll be famous for, not your books but you wrecked all the - how did the scientists - are the scientists laughed at at these universities where they, you know, I'm doing the study - Ms. ROACH: Yes. I think they are politely behind their backs laughed at at a place like the University of Virginia. In fact, the new president there has told Dr. Greyson that he doesn't want him talking about his paranormal work anymore.  So the fact that I'm here on NPR discussing this experiment, rather out there experiment going on at the University of Virginia is not at all what they want to have happen.  But yeah, it's very tough. It's - you don't go into this field these days without risking certain stain on your reputation, I guess.  FLATOW: Yeah. How do you explain some of these shows we've seen on TV where, you know, I think it's Crossing Over with John Edwards or people like that who are able to communicate with dead of relatives? But - and it seems to be so true, things they come up with, you know.  Ms. ROACH: Right. You know, I have not seen John Edwards's show in particular but I watched a television show, sort of an expose about a year ago. And I don't know which show it was but the way they were doing it was they have a line of people waiting to be in the studio audience. And in that line are a number of plants, people who work for the show.  And in the - you know, while they're just chatting on line and having what seems to be ordinary conversations they are revealing some things about themselves. And the plants are making a note of that and then sort of subtly mark the leg of the chair of a number of these people.  And that was - that was a technique that I heard about.  FLATOW: And - Ms. ROACH: But I know what - go ahead.  FLATOW: No. Go ahead. I'm sorry.  Ms. ROACH: I was going to say, if you're working with a large group of people and you start out, you know, I'm getting the letter C. Well, all right, there's going to be quite a number of people out there, you know, gray haired woman letter C. And someone's going to raise their hand. And you work from there.  It's much easier to do a mass group cold reading than it is a one on one. So in a sense it might be easier to do it that way.  FLATOW: And in fact you uncover a lot of the ruses used in s\u00e9ances, places like that, the slime and the ectoplasm.  Ms. ROACH: Ectoplasm is a personal favorite of mine, that chapter.  FLATOW: Yeah.  Ms. ROACH: Yeah, Ectoplasm - the heyday of s\u00e9ances and ectoplasms was around the 1920s. And it really was amazing to me - I should try to explain ectoplasm to people, which is not easy to do.  FLATOW: If you haven't seen Ghostbusters, forget about it.  Ms. ROACH: Yeah, exactly. Go rent Ghostbusters. Ectoplasm was supposedly spirit energy made physical. In other words, the medium would produce, kind of exude this stuff. And it's dark in the room, remember. And this stuff seems to be coming out of the person's mouth. It's sort of like a gauzy, filmy stuff.  And it was - they claimed it was - this was spirit energy that they were kind of channeling and it was a physical manifestation of the spiritual.  And amazingly enough, Scientific American devoted four issues, there was a four part series on one of these ectoplasm producing mediums. It was taken very, very seriously by the scientific community in the 1920s. The Sorbonne did an investigation of a woman named Eva C. It was kind of mind blowing because when you look at the photographs, it's just - you look at it and you say my God, that's just gauze. It's cheese cloth. Come on, guys.  But people fell for it because what you needed to understand how these women were doing it was you needed a magician. You needed - for example, Harry Houdini got involved in debunking one of the very famous mediums because no one else - they would search them. You know, they would search their clothing before the s\u00e9ance, actually did cavity searches. I mean, this was very thorough. And the mediums would still, they'd go in their cabinet, the curtain would open. Tada, there's the ectoplasm. They thought how are they doing it?  FLATOW: Yeah. That's what the amazing James Randi has been saying for years. Bring a magician, because we know what to look for.  Ms. ROACH: Yeah, exactly. But because some of these folks with Nobel Prizes and PhDs were fooled, and they spoke out saying look, we believe it's genuine, I mean, who's going to question somebody with a Nobel Prize. But in fact what you needed was a - yeah, you needed a magician to say aha, this is what they're doing.  FLATOW: What's also interesting, as you point out about the confluence of the age of electricity and the turn of the last century and the rise of all these s\u00e9ances and other kinds of parapsychology.  Ms. ROACH: Yeah. I was - I think that helps - for me, it made a little easier to understand how people could have accepted it. Because this was a period of time that was right after the invention of the wireless telegraph and, you know, electricity hadn't been around that long and the telephone. And people had had to accept, you know, this seeming witchery of voice flying through the ether across the country and coming out on the end of a receiver.  And I think that they thought well, you know, it's not such a big leap to imagine that a medium could be sort of acting as a receiver from the beyond. And even Thomas Edison actually tried to make a receiver - actually an amplifier to amplify these little, little, teeny, tiny voices of people who had died.  FLATOW: Yeah, you had some very famous scientists who in their later lives went on into the occult, you know. I think Alexander Graham Bell, people like that.  Ms. ROACH: Yeah. Sir Oliver Lodge, Sir Crooks, William James.  FLATOW: Yeah. Let's go to the phones.  Ms. ROACH: Yeah.  FLATOW: Mary in Cincinnati. Hi. Welcome to Science Friday.  MARY (Caller): Hi, thanks for taking my call.  FLATOW: Go ahead.  MARY: Basically, I share the same skepticism and scientific approach as Mary does, and my question for her was - because I did, myself, a non-life-threatening scientific experiment of going through past life regression therapy, you know, to kind of give myself a first hand experience, and I wonder, Mary, if you, yourself, have done anything - not anything dangerous, but anything like past life regression therapy or anything like that that was a little more spiritual in nature that might give you some personal evidence?  Ms. ROACH: You know, I did two things, actually. First of all, I enrolled, like a fool, in medium school in London at this venerable old spiritualist college, and I took a weekend course, thinking maybe I just don't understand how it works. I failed.  FLATOW: Not a good medium, huh?  Ms. ROACH: Yeah, the chapter's called Soul in a Dunce Cap. The other thing I thought about doing but did not is in the chapter on near-death experience, there is a drug called ketamine, and people report that if you take this drug, you experience an ersatz near-death experience sometimes, depending on how you take it and how much you take. And I thought, you know, without knowing much about this drug, I though oh hey, that's an idea. I'll just try ketamine. And then I read a little bit more about it, and I decided that was probably a bad idea. But I did not have myself regressed. I am regressed enough.  FLATOW: There you go. Thanks, Mary, for calling.  Ms. ROACH: Thank you.  MARY: Thank you, thank you.  FLATOW: Have a great weekend. 1-800-989-8255 is our number. Let's go to Adam in Kansas City. Hi, Adam.  ADAM (Caller): Hello.  FLATOW: Hi there.  Ms. ROACH: Hi Adam.  ADAM: Yeah. I just wondered if she had any comments on psychics helping police solve crimes, and I would think that if there was any truth to that, that there would be fairly good documentation to check up on that.  Ms. ROACH: You know, there is - if you go on the Web site - I personally didn't do any research on psychic detectives, but there's a really good article on that on the Web site of the CSICOP, the Committee for Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal. That's a mouthful. Anyway, it's about -specifically, I think, about Allison DuBois, who is the medium upon whom the show Medium is based, and there is somebody who looks at her work and is not terribly impressed by it, I believe.  ADAM: Okay. I was just thinking that if this is one of your endeavors, that that might be a compelling area to check out. I was wondering why you wouldn't check that out, if it might be a good source to find something out.  Ms. ROACH: Well, I did spend some time in a lab where they had a few mediums coming in, but it wasn't specifically psychic detective work. I am a little bit more inclined toward the people trying to find proof or evidence in a laboratory setting, and the psychic detective work - I suppose if you had a case, yes, of somebody who had fingered - come up with the name of the murderer and the evidence, I mean, that would be pretty remarkable, but that's more of a psychic thing than a mediumship.  FLATOW: Right. You're into afterlife things.  Ms. ROACH: Yeah.  FLATOW: Did you ever find anybody in your research who, you know, and you followed people looking for ghosts in haunted houses who had any credible evidence or any real credible, you know, data?  Ms. ROACH: I think the best - the most intriguing and the hardest to dismiss is some of the studies in the realm of near-death experience, and I'll try to explain one to you.  I was trying to find studies, things that took this out of the realm of anecdote, because near-death experiences, there's a tremendous number of, you know, people's stories and of anecdotes about it. But to actually set up a controlled experiment was more what I was interested in.  There was one done by Michael Sabin, who's a cardiologist, and he got a group of people who'd had an out-of-body, near-death experience where they had seen themselves being resuscitated down below, and he had these people write down in as much detail as they could, what did you see exactly. And then he got a control group, and that was patients who had been in a resuscitation, they had been in emergency rooms, seen a crash cart, seen defibrillator paddles. You know, they knew what everything looked like. And he said to them okay, describe in as much detail as you can what it would look like if you were being resuscitated.  And then he looked at the two groups' descriptions, and the people who'd had the near-death experience who claim to have been watching didn't make medical errors and were surprisingly detailed. I mean, it was - I read a bunch of transcripts of those reports, and you know, they would - like, there would be a man saying well, then there was a machine - you know, the needle came up, not all at once. It was on, you know, and then he named another type of meter -but, you know, it partially is part way up and it came back down, then it came back up. I mean, the level of detail is amazing.  Meanwhile, the control group, you know, you had suction cups attached to defibrillators, people being pounded on the back instead of the front. I mean, it was like chimpanzees were running the emergency room.  FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255. We're talking with Mary Roach, author of Spook, on TALK OF THE NATION Science Friday from NPR News.  You pose an interesting question at the end of your book. Has my year among the evidence gatherers left me believing in anything I didn't believe in a year ago? Well, has it?  Ms. ROACH: Oh, Ira, you're asking me to give away the end of the book.  FLATOW: Sorry. You can circumlocate it, as they say.  Ms. ROACH: No, you know, I will say what - I think I ended up - because I posed the same question to Bruce Greyson, who is the guy at the University of Virginia who does a lot of the near-death experience work. And I said, well, are you - do you believe? Do you - you know, seriously. Are you convinced that somebody's consciousness can actually kind of function independent of their body? I mean, do you believe that?  And he said, well, what I believe is in the possibility of something that we haven't figured out yet. And that's, you know - and I would say you could describe me that way. I think - and my little, brief confused foray into quantum mechanics made me believe that there may be things we just haven't figured out.  FLATOW: Right. So there can be spooky action at a distance. There could be anything.  Ms. ROACH: Yeah, exactly.  FLATOW: And of course, there's not a lot of federal grant money going into studying these things.  Ms. ROACH: No, no. It's kind of amazing anyone is still doing this work. And the reason the University of Virginia is doing it, interestingly, they got a huge grant from Chester Carlson, the inventor of the Xerox machine, left this huge - he bequeathed - they wouldn't tell me how many millions, but enough to have kept them going for quite some time. And specifically, the money is earmarked for research into the survival of the personality at death. So they have funding.  FLATOW: Well, if you know the history of Chester Carlson, you know what a terrible, difficult time he had in life.  Ms. ROACH: He what?  FLATOW: He had such a terrible time convincing anybody of the need to have a Xerox machine, so you know why he had such a tough life. And he left some money over for other people. So where do you go from here? Do you have anything that you want to follow up on in your book, or another book in mind on the same sort of subject?  Ms. ROACH: I have another book that I'm working on. I'm kind of turning a corner. I'm leaving dead people behind. Enough with the dead people. But it's more bodies in laboratories, but it's sex research.  FLATOW: Sex research. You want a real bestseller now. You can combine dead bodies and sex - Ms. ROACH: That's not why I'm doing it.  FLATOW: You don't want combine - go there with the dead bodies and sex research.  Ms. ROACH: No, no.  FLATOW: Well, thank you very much for taking time to talk with us, and good luck to you, and have a - are you doing anything special on Halloween?  Ms. ROACH: I'm doing a reading in the Haight-Ashbury, and I'm trying to figure out - I may dress up as ectoplasm, but I feel it may be too messy.  FLATOW: You have to keep replenishing it then.  Ms. ROACH: Yes.  FLATOW: Well, Mary Roach will be dripping through Haight-Ashbury. So have a happy Halloween and thank you for joining us.  Ms. ROACH: Thank you so much, Ira.

MADELEINE BRAND, host: I'm Madeleine Brand. In a few minutes, federal investigators say they've broken up a crime ring that looted thousands of Native American artifacts from archeological sites. But first. . . CHADWICK: The Bomb in the Backyard, the provocative cover story of the new issue of the magazine, Foreign Policy. Terrorists don't need to smuggle a bomb into this country, it suggests, they might more easily build one here and set it off. Jeffrey Lewis is Co-Author, he's a scholar at Harvard, and creator of the weapons control blog Armscontrolwonk. com. Jeffrey Lewis, you and your colleague, Peter Zimmerman, give pretty detailed instructions on how someone might go about this. I am pretty amazed to read how simple a task you seem to think this is. Mr. JEFFREY LEWIS (Co-Author, The Bomb In The Backyard): I don't know that I would say that we think it's a simple task. But in answering the question of how hard is it, the answer we came to was it's not hard enough. And I would just say that we were very careful not to give anyone a cookbook. CHADWICK: But you do - you break this down in a way that I can kind of get it that is you kind of budget the thing. You think you need 19 people carrying out various tasks and you're going to spend about $5. 5 million. You're going to buy a ranch somewhere in a remote part of America - 150 acres would be enough - and there you would begin to assemble people and materials. Like what? Mr. LEWIS: The principal activity was organized around a series of teams. We had a physics team, which would be responsible for designing the bomb, and we had several other teams: a team that operated a foundry that would cast the uranium metal; we had a team that would put together the gun mechanism, this was a very simple atomic device that just essentially slam two lumps of uranium together. CHADWICK: The real thing you need though, is enriched uranium, to make a bomb. And that, you note, actually is available too. Mr. LEWIS: Right. Well that's the hardest part and that's the place we think we should spend most of our efforts. But, at the same time, there is at least one case where there was a theft of a substantial amount of highly-enriched uranium. Fortunately, the fellows who stole it tried to sell it to some Czech police officers. And so, that worked out all right. But - we think this is hard, but it's not hard enough. There are still simple things that we could do that would make us safer. CHADWICK: As I was reading your description of how to go about doing this, I was thinking to myself - if it's this easy how come North Korea didn't develop a bomb 10 years ago?  Why can't the Iranians get one next week? Mr. LEWIS: Well in the case of Iran, the reason that Iran hasn't been able to build a bomb is that they don't have the fissile material. We posited a scenario where the terrorists stole, or otherwise acquired through the black market - the uranium for the bomb - the highly enriched uranium. In the case of Iran, they're trying to make it. And that's what much of the current crisis concerns - is Iran's efforts to install centrifuges that would allow to make enriched uranium. In terms of North Korea they have had a bomb, probably for ten years, because they acquired plutonium - which they separated from the spent fuel of a nuclear reactor. The decision of the North Koreans to threaten to do that was what precipitated the crisis in the early 1990s that the Clinton Administration intervened to stop. CHADWICK: I guess it's how to think like a terrorist. But still, the calculations that I find you making here are disturbing in a weird kind of way. That is, you actually break it down and say - a nuclear bomb would be, in fact, a very cost-effective way to kill a lot of people. Mr. LEWIS: Well, they weren't fun calculations to do. What the Genesis of the article really was, was this debate about whether or not terrorists were interested in killing lots of people. And there is this phrase that comes out of one of the terrorist trials that we thought was really important. Where one of these fellows was asked why al-Qaida was interested in buying Uranium and he said because you could kill more people. CHADWICK: Well if you mean this, at least in part, to be some kind of a guide for how to stop this, what is it that people could really do? What could governments do? Mr. LEWIS: Our principal recommendation was securing stockpiles of fissile material - highly enriched uranium and plutonium. There are many efforts, ongoing, to do that. One can always do more. We were also taken at the importance of scientific and technical expertise. And so we think it would be a good idea to expand the sort of programs that take people who have the skill sets that al-Qaida or another terrorists group might be interested in, and making sure that they are fully-employed and not selling their talents on the black market. CHADWICK: Jeffrey Lewis is author, with Peter Zimmerman, of the cover article in the new issue of Foreign Policy Magazine, it's called The Bomb in the Backyard.

Mr. JEFFREY LEWIS (Co-Author, The Bomb In The Backyard): I don't know that I would say that we think it's a simple task. But in answering the question of how hard is it, the answer we came to was it's not hard enough. And I would just say that we were very careful not to give anyone a cookbook.  CHADWICK: But you do - you break this down in a way that I can kind of get it that is you kind of budget the thing. You think you need 19 people carrying out various tasks and you're going to spend about $5. 5 million. You're going to buy a ranch somewhere in a remote part of America - 150 acres would be enough - and there you would begin to assemble people and materials.  Like what?  Mr. LEWIS: The principal activity was organized around a series of teams. We had a physics team, which would be responsible for designing the bomb, and we had several other teams: a team that operated a foundry that would cast the uranium metal; we had a team that would put together the gun mechanism, this was a very simple atomic device that just essentially slam two lumps of uranium together.  CHADWICK: The real thing you need though, is enriched uranium, to make a bomb. And that, you note, actually is available too.  Mr. LEWIS: Right. Well that's the hardest part and that's the place we think we should spend most of our efforts. But, at the same time, there is at least one case where there was a theft of a substantial amount of highly-enriched uranium. Fortunately, the fellows who stole it tried to sell it to some Czech police officers. And so, that worked out all right.  But - we think this is hard, but it's not hard enough. There are still simple things that we could do that would make us safer.  CHADWICK: As I was reading your description of how to go about doing this, I was thinking to myself - if it's this easy how come North Korea didn't develop a bomb 10 years ago?  Why can't the Iranians get one next week?  Mr. LEWIS: Well in the case of Iran, the reason that Iran hasn't been able to build a bomb is that they don't have the fissile material. We posited a scenario where the terrorists stole, or otherwise acquired through the black market - the uranium for the bomb - the highly enriched uranium.  In the case of Iran, they're trying to make it. And that's what much of the current crisis concerns - is Iran's efforts to install centrifuges that would allow to make enriched uranium. In terms of North Korea they have had a bomb, probably for ten years, because they acquired plutonium - which they separated from the spent fuel of a nuclear reactor.  The decision of the North Koreans to threaten to do that was what precipitated the crisis in the early 1990s that the Clinton Administration intervened to stop.  CHADWICK: I guess it's how to think like a terrorist. But still, the calculations that I find you making here are disturbing in a weird kind of way. That is, you actually break it down and say - a nuclear bomb would be, in fact, a very cost-effective way to kill a lot of people.  Mr. LEWIS: Well, they weren't fun calculations to do. What the Genesis of the article really was, was this debate about whether or not terrorists were interested in killing lots of people. And there is this phrase that comes out of one of the terrorist trials that we thought was really important. Where one of these fellows was asked why al-Qaida was interested in buying Uranium and he said because you could kill more people.  CHADWICK: Well if you mean this, at least in part, to be some kind of a guide for how to stop this, what is it that people could really do? What could governments do?  Mr. LEWIS: Our principal recommendation was securing stockpiles of fissile material - highly enriched uranium and plutonium. There are many efforts, ongoing, to do that. One can always do more.  We were also taken at the importance of scientific and technical expertise. And so we think it would be a good idea to expand the sort of programs that take people who have the skill sets that al-Qaida or another terrorists group might be interested in, and making sure that they are fully-employed and not selling their talents on the black market.  CHADWICK: Jeffrey Lewis is author, with Peter Zimmerman, of the cover article in the new issue of Foreign Policy Magazine, it's called The Bomb in the Backyard. Jeffrey Lewis, thank you for speaking with us.  Mr. LEWIS: It was a real pleasure.  (Soundbite of music)  CHADWICK: And there is more coming up on DAY TO DAY.

I'm Joe Palca in for Ira Flatow. New York City wants to get the fat out of your diet, or, more specifically, the trans fat. The city health department is proposing that restaurants drastically reduce the amount of trans fats in the foods they serve. The reason for this shift is that a diet high in trans fats is associated with heart disease, and possibly other ailments as well. In this hour we'll talk about the evidence for the dangers trans fats pose, and we'll also talk about whether requiring restaurants to cut back on trans fats will have the desired effect on the health of New Yorkers and others who visit the Big Apple. And we'd like to have your thoughts on the subject, so give us a call. Our number is 1-800-989-8255. That's 1-800-989-TALK. And if you want more information about what we'll be talking about this hour, go to our Web site at www. sciencefriday. com. Now let me introduce my first guests. Dariush Mozaffarian is a cardiologist and instructor at the Harvard Medical School and Harvard School of Public Health. He's written a review article that was recently published in the New England Journal of Medicine about trans fats and heart disease. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY, Dr. Mozaffarian. Dr. DARIUSH MOZAFFARIAN (Cardiologist Harvard Medical School): Thank you. Good afternoon. PALCA: Good afternoon. And also here with me in Studio 3A is Sheila Cohn Weiss. She's a registered dietician and director of nutrition policy at the National Restaurant Association. Thanks for coming in. Ms. SHEILA COHN WEISS (Director of Nutrition Policy, National Restaurant Association): Oh, thank you for having me. PALCA: Well, so maybe, Dr. Mozaffarian, we can start with you. And let's get some definitions going here to begin with what is a trans fat? Dr. MOZAFFARIAN: Well, the word trans refers to the type of double bond it has. All fatty acids that are not saturated have double bonds, and trans is a certain kind of double bond that's generally not present in nature. Mammals don't make trans bonds, for example. And very small amounts are present naturally in some foods, but the type of bond is really only seen in foods that are produced or prepared with partially hydrogenated vegetable oils. PALCA: Yeah. You know, I want to go a little further. I don't mean to make this into a whole big definition thing, but what does it mean - I guess everybody's heard this, you know, saturated fats and polyunsaturated fats - but what does that mean, a saturated fat? Dr. MOZAFFARIAN: Well, so all fats are strings of carbon molecules connected by bonds, and if there are hydrogens on those carbons and there's no double bonds, then the type of fatty acid is called saturated. PALCA: Mm-hmm. Dr. MOZAFFARIAN: If there's double bonds between the carbons, so they have fewer hydrogens, then they become unsaturated. And if there's just one unsaturated bond, it's a monounsaturated fat, such as seen in olive oil. PALCA: Mm-hmm. Dr. MOZAFFARIAN: And if it has multiple double bonds, it's a polyunsaturated fat, such as found in vegetable oils. And the trans bond, the trans refers to the orientation of those hydrogen bonds - of those hydrogen molecules - excuse me - around the double bond. If they're on the same side of the double bond, it becomes trans. And then what that does is it alters the physical properties of the fatty acid. And, you know, that's in fact in some ways why this was developed in the first place, because you can take an oil that's liquid at room temperature, like soybean oil or safflower oil, and you can partially hydrogenate it, add these trans bonds, and you make it solid or semi-solid at room temperature. So you're actually altering the chemical properties of a fatty acid by altering the type of bond it has. PALCA: Got it. And I'm going to take a stab from my organic chemistry - which I'm sure has changed enormously since I learned it - but anyway, bonds are what attach the carbon molecules to each other and what the - how the hydrogen attaches to the carbon. But the carbon has this unique property that it can have not just one bond but two bonds connecting the same two carbons. Did I do that right? Dr. MOZAFFARIAN: Correct. Yes. Ms. WEISS: Yes. PALCA: All right. Through the uprights. Thank you very much. Okay, so then the question is why would the - what would be the evidence or why would a trans fat be worse for you than a cis fat or a polyunsaturated fat? Dr. MOZAFFARIAN: Well, those are two different questions. PALCA: Okay. Dr. MOZAFFARIAN: You know, sort of the why and what the evidence is. PALCA: Okay. Dr. MOZAFFARIAN: The why I think is very interesting and, you know, what makes nutritional - the study of nutrition so interesting. You know, we think we -traditionally, a person might think of fats as just a carrier of calories. You know, that's what I eat it as calories. It gets into my fat cells. But really fats are what make us multi-cellular. If we didn't have fat, we wouldn't have cells because all of the cells, the membranes of the cells, are mostly fat molecules. And so the way the cells of our body interact with each other is determined by the composition of that membrane. And so different fatty acids in the membrane alter the way the different cells function and communicate with each other. And so, you know, when you eat trans fats, it gets taken up into your membranes, of all the membranes of the body, and has different effects on different cells and different organ systems. PALCA: Mm-hmm. Okay. Well, let me turn to Sheila Cohn Weiss here in the studio. First of all, as someone who's interested in nutrition, I mean do we need trans fats, or are they just a modern convenience that turns out to be not so good for us? Ms. WEISS: Well, it all started in the early '70s and '80s, when scientific research and consumer demand pushed our industry and the food industry away from saturated fats, and we started to use partially hydrogenated oils, which obviously contained trans fats, to use as a substitute. And they have shown to have longer shelf life, provide crispiness to food products and provide a desirable mouth feel. Now as we all know and as was just discussed, recent research shows over the last several years that trans fats, along with saturated fats and dietary cholesterol, do contribute to coronary heart disease. And that is the reason why, over the last several years, our industry has been making great strides to move away from oils containing trans fats in order to find other alternatives. PALCA: But is - I mean is it just convenience, or is it price? Is there a reason not to just say, oh, well, let's get rid of them all together if they're not good for you? Ms. WEISS: Well, moving away from trans fats has proven to be a challenge for our industry. There are many reasons for that. One of the main reasons is that of supply. PALCA: Mm-hmm. Ms. WEISS: There currently is not enough supply for all of our nation's restaurants to move away from partially hydrogenated vegetable oils. In addition, it takes a great deal of testing. A lot of restaurants have moved away and have made great strides, but in doing so it's taken them upwards of two years to find the appropriate substitute, one that provides adequate shelf life, that will maintain the taste and quality of the foods that were prepared before with trans fat oil. PALCA: Okay. Well, let's see if we can get our listeners to come in on this conversation, and let's go first to Louise(ph) in Paradise, California. Louise, welcome to the program. LOUISE (Caller): Yes, hi. PALCA: Hi. LOUISE: I am - have eaten - I'm a person who has eaten a lot of trans fat in the form of Crisco and margarine and baked goods all my life. PALCA: Mm-hmm. LOUISE: And the thing is that I discovered about five years ago when I developed very severe colon problems was that - I was led to research this subject a lot and discovered that the - it not only accumulates in the coronary arteries, as they've discovered, but it also is layering in the colon and known as bucoid(ph) plaque. PALCA: Huh. Well, Louise, let me see what Dr. Mozaffarian has to say about that. Have you any evidence or have you seen any evidence that it's more than just the coronary arteries that are a problem from trans fats? Dr. MOZAFFARIAN: Well, you know, the - I think it's important, first of all, to not lump trans fats together with saturated fats or dietary cholesterol because the strength of the evidence and the size of the effect, calorie for calorie, there's really no comparison. It's - trans fats are pretty much an additive to foods, where, you know, saturated fats are naturally found in meats and dairy products. PALCA: Mm-hmm. Dr. MOZAFFARIAN: In terms of different conditions that are affected, there's very strong evidence for coronary heart disease. There's good evidence for sudden cardiac death, which is, you know, when someone sort of dies, suddenly keels over on the street. There's growing evidence for diabetes and maybe weight gain. I have not seen strong evidence for colon disease but, you know, as a cardiologist, that's not my main area of research. There may have been some studies that I'm unaware of. PALCA: Yeah. But let me just ask you then, what was your - I know you testified at a hearing earlier this week about the New York City plans - what do you think they should do? Or what - do you think their plans are good ones, to reduce over the next 18 months what restaurants are permitted to serve? Dr. MOZAFFARIAN: Well, you know, my testimony focused on the science, on the harmful effects and the magnitude of the effect. But I think that, you know, the New York initiative is a very sensible initiative. They're giving time to the restaurants. They're, you know, allowing some small levels of trans fats, and, you know, there's certainly enough supply in the world to supply New York City to make these changes. It's going to be invisible to the consumers. It's not going to increase cost or change taste. They're not banning any foods. It's just changing sort of the additives in the foods. And so I think as a matter of food safety, the policy makes sense. PALCA: What's - what about you, Sheila Weiss? What does the National Restaurant Association feel about New York's plans? Ms. WEISS: Well, I also was testified on Monday at the public hearing in New York City, and I think to begin with - I mean, like I said, there are many, many aspects of the ban that we do not agree with, and what came up many times is that of supply. Now the product, for example - and we've worked a lot with our industry partners on this - and to begin with, the New York City restaurant - the New York City ban takes a very narrow approach by looking at one item. And like I mentioned before, the issue of supply is one that we have faced. It's - many people have said that supply isn't a problem, but. . . PALCA: So this is supply as an alternative to what's being used today. Ms. WEISS: Yes. PALCA: Okay. Ms. WEISS: Yes, alternative oils. PALCA: I see. Ms. WEISS: For example, many restaurants are looking to low-linolenic soybean oil. And we have found that the production of low-linolenic soybean oil in the United States for 2006 is estimated to be about 400 million pounds of oil. But one quick-service restaurant alone in our country is estimated to use about 330 million pounds of oil each year, so that. . . PALCA: So quick service is what the Restaurant Association refers to what we mostly think of as fast-food restaurants? Ms. WEISS: Yes, absolutely. PALCA: Okay, good. All right. So there's just a problem there. Ms. WEISS: Yes. PALCA: Okay. Well, we're going to spend quite a bit of the next hour talking about that and what remedies there might be for that, so please all listeners stay with us. And we'd like to take your calls at 1-800-989-8255. That's 1-800-989-TALK. And we'll be back after a short break to talk more about trans fats and other kinds of fats. Stay with us. (Soundbite of music) PALCA: From NPR News, this is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Joe Palca. We're talking this hour about trans fats, and my guests are Dariush Mozaffarian - he's a cardiologist at the Harvard Medical School and Harvard School of Public Health in Boston - and Sheila Cohn Weiss, she's a registered dietician who is the director of nutrition policy at the National Restaurant Association. And let me introduce now my next guest. Gale Brewer is a member of the New York City Council. She represents District 6, which covers the Upper West Side and Lincoln Center. That's my old stomping ground. I used to live around there. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY, Ms. Brewer. Ms. GALE BREWER (District 6, New York City Council): Thank you very much. PALCA: So we've been talking about the department of health's plans to cut - to require restaurants to cut back on the amount of foods they serve containing trans fats. What do you think about this plan? Ms. BREWER: Well, I certainly have a lot of restaurants, as you suggest, in my district, and obviously we have thousands in New York City, but I think it's a good idea. I've certainly talked to some of the owners of restaurants on the West Side, and I think they do feel it is the wave of the future. PALCA: Mm-hmm. Ms. BREWER: However, we also have large and we have smaller ethnic restaurants, and we do need a little bit more time than the commissioner may have in mind, and a little bit more education in terms of some of the smaller restaurants. I know the commissioner of health in New York City hopes to vote on the proposal by the board of health December of 2006, and then within, you know, six months - July 2007 - try to have the removal of some of these trans fats but. . . PALCA: But. . . Ms. BREWER: . . . it's a short time period. PALCA: Sure, I understand. But you're convinced by the evidence that we've heard from Dr. Mozaffarian and others that there is a need to do this. Ms. BREWER: I would agree. I mean there are issues to work out. That's why, you know, challenges remain and education is needed. For instance, out-of-state foods, baked foods, will continue to be sold. And we all love New Jersey, but we want New York City products to be purchased. . . PALCA: Mm-hmm. Ms. BREWER: . . . and, you know, sometimes within the kosher community - bakeries, caterers and so on - they're going to have to find alternatives that are par because they need to be neutral, not to contain dairy products, as you probably know. PALCA: Sure. Ms. BREWER: So there are issues that need to be addressed. PALCA: Well, let me just ask you. This proposal only relates to restaurants - and it's nice that people can go out to restaurants, and I suppose a lot of food is served in restaurants - but certainly most people get the bulk of the food from what they buy in the grocery stores, and there's no limitations being placed on that. So are you missing a big opportunity to have an impact here? Or is it just that you don't have jurisdiction to say no trans fats? Ms. BREWER: It's jurisdictional. The bodegas and delis, for instance, as long as food is prepared where their revenue is less than 50 percent - and certainly farmers' markets, which we love - they're both overseen by the New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets. PALCA: I see. Okay. Well, let's continue to hear what our listeners have to say, and we'd like to hear from you. Our number is 800-989-8255, and let's go to Robert in Rochester, New York. Robert, welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. ROBERT (Caller): Hello. Hello? PALCA: Hello. ROBERT: Yes, I was wondering how the trans fats in the meat section of the stores - I don't go out to restaurants that often, so I'm mainly concerned about the food that I buy, and a lot of them these days do have the trans fat, nutritional amounts, if any. . . PALCA: Huh. ROBERT: . . . either zero. I have a substitute butter. I don't think you'd call it margarine, but it has one gram percentage of daily serving. PALCA: Uh-huh. ROBERT: Now what is one gram of trans fat in terms of your total nutrition and its effect on your health? PALCA: Well, let me ask Dr. Mozaffarian that. There's a table in your article talking about the amount of trans fats in food, and I guess one gram is kind of on the low end of the amounts that you would find in most food servings. Is that right? Dr. MOZAFFARIAN: Well, I - you know, the first question: Are there trans fats in the meat section? You know, most - if a food doesn't contain partially hydrogenated oils, it'll contain very, very little or no trans fats. So it's really just foods that are made with partially hydrogenated oils. And, you know, in contrast to restaurants, when you go to the grocery store, you can look at the label and, you know, make a choice about different foods. PALCA: Mm-hmm. Dr. MOZAFFARIAN: One gram per serving represents - well, let's put it this way. Risk is seen with trans fats at very, very low levels of intake, so even three or four grams per day might increase risk of heart disease. So - and that's very different from, you know, other nutrients. So one gram per serving of margarine, if you have a couple of servings in the day and then you, you know, eat something else that might have it and you eat something else, it adds up very quickly. So since there are products that can be chosen that have no trans fats, I think it's prudent and it makes sense to, you know, go and find a different butter substitute that has zero rather than the one that has one. PALCA: Got it. Okay, let's take another call now from Byron in Jacksonville, Florida. Byron, welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. BYRON (Caller): Hi. Hey, Joe. Friday's my favorite day. I love this show. (Soundbite of laughter) PALCA: Great. BYRON: I think that the consumer should be able to make that choice. I grew up - my mother drilled into me: everything in moderation, nothing in excess. We should - if you want to put it on the menu, hey, this has trans fats in it. I look forward to going to a Chinese restaurant and loading up on bad food, but I do it every two or three weeks. I think it's ridiculous that you're saying - that Gale is saying, oh, we shouldn't even sell this. Label it. Let the consumer decide. That's the only way it should be. Where do we draw the line? Too much sugar in my sweet tea? I live in the South. We put bacon grease in our turnip greens. (Soundbite of laughter) BYRON: It's delicious. I don't eat it everyday. PALCA: I see. BYRON: Thank you. PALCA: Okay, well, maybe we should let Gale Brewer have a response to that. Why not just label things and tell people what they're in for and not dictate to them how they're supposed to be fed? Ms. BREWER: Well, I mean I think what happens in New York is we have actually a very good experience with the no-smoking law where people really understood it after it was passed. There was a lot of fuss before it was passed. And, you know, the people who are working in the restaurants feel better and it hasn't turned out to be a big challenge in terms of street noise, people smoking outside. PALCA: Yeah. Ms. BREWER: It's very positive health-wise. And I think as, you know, a legislator and as the commissioner of health has said, we need to be thinking about public health. It is true; people in their homes can cook and use, you know, right now any one of these ingredients. And the fact of the matter is, though, restaurants, I think when you go you're not sure, spending time looking up on the board, as to what the ingredients are. These restaurants are sometimes small. I don't know how accurate the boards could be kept, and I think that, you know, the least we can do is a city concerned about public health, people living longer and having healthier lives. It's also, to be honest with you, a situation where we have, you know, thousands of different, wonderful ethnic restaurants, and it would be very difficult in language and space to list all the different ingredients. It's my opinion, having talked to restaurateurs today, owners of ethnic restaurants, that in many cases they have already gotten rid of trans fat. The consumer doesn't know and the food is equally delicious. PALCA: All right. Gale Brewer. . . Dr. MOZAFFARIAN: Can I. . . PALCA: . . . thanks very much for joining us today. Gale Brewer is a member of the New York City Council, representing District 6. Ms. BREWER: Thank you very much. PALCA: You're welcome. And, Dr. Mozaffarian, you wanted to add something. Dr. MOZAFFARIAN: Yeah, I also wanted to respond to that. I think that, you know, it's not really a question of regulating what people eat or deciding what people can and can't eat. There's going to be no change in the food that a person eats. It's really a question of an additive to the foods, and I think the example that the New York Department of Public Health used, which is appropriate, is the example of lead in paint. You know, lead was added to paint. We saw it was a danger. You can take the lead out of paint and still have paint, and so, you know, it's a safety measure. You know, by the most conservative estimates, about 1,400 heart attack deaths each year in New York are due to trans fats, so that's over 100 New Yorkers killed per month. I think that, you know, that's a - if it can be removed without any effect on choice, on price, on taste, which the evidence suggests it can, then why should we have it in the food? PALCA: Well, I just want to turn to Sheila Cohn Weiss. I mean do you agree that this needs to be mandated, or, like the caller said, it's enough to let people know? I mean would the restaurant industry be happy just informing people who cared enough to ask? Ms. WEISS: Well, I think, first of all, I wanted to say I'm really glad that Councilman Brewer was on - was part of this discussion to bring to light from New York City what is actually going on. And I think that we can agree that the outcome of the board of health and New York state - New York City - as well as the restaurant industry, seeks the same. We all want to move away from trans fat and oils. I'm not here to say that trans fats are healthy or to dispute those aspects of this discussion. I'm here to talk about what the restaurant industry is doing, as well as the challenges we face. Councilman Brewer brought up some - Councilwoman Brewer, excuse me - brought up some really good points about how the restaurants in New York City need more time and need more education. A year ago, the New York City Department of Health says that they sent out brochures to their city's restaurants. Well, when we talked to our members in New York City, very few of them had actually received anything from the Board of Health. And many of them did not, were not contacted by inspectors or by members of the Board to discuss this issue and to talk about how to seek alternatives. So I think taking a step and actually talking to the restaurant operators about how they can make this change is really important in this move. PALCA: Okay. Well, we've been talking about a family of fats that are pretty widely considered to be bad for you. And now, I'd to introduce, sort of welcome to the program someone with a good perspective or an interesting perspective on the a whole other class of fats and whether maybe it's their absence rather than the presence of something else is part of the problem. So joining me now is Susan Allport. She's a science writer in New York City at New York State. And her new book is The Queen of Fats: Why Omega-3s Were Removed from the Western Diet and what we can do to replace them. She joins us today from NPR's New York bureau. And welcome to Science Friday. It says here Ms. Allport, but I can't think of her that way because Susie Allport and I went to college together once upon a time. Ms. SUSAN ALLPORT (Science writer): That's correct. PALCA: So it's going to have to be to Susie. I can't do anything about that. I'm sorry. Welcome, Susie. Ms. ALLPORT: Right. Hi, Joe. Thanks so much for having me on to speak on this subject. PALCA: Nice to talk to you. We haven't spoken in a long time. Ms. ALLPORT: Yeah, nice to - I know. PALCA: So - but what about this? I mean, are we focusing our wrath in the wrong place? Ms. ALLPORT: I think so. I have such a different perspective on trans fats and it's one - it's a perspective that connect the trans fats story to the much more important omega-3 story. And it's a perspective that we absolutely have to understand if this ban is actually going to improve the health of New Yorkers. Just backing up a little bit. Trans fats, as we all know, are formed when vegetable oils are partially hydrogenated to make them more stable and solid. But what most people don't know is that this process selectively eliminates the omega-3s in these fats, turning them into trans fats as well as omega-6s. And that's a second family of fats that are also essential but that compete with the omega-3s for enzyme in cell membranes. By the way, we have many more of these six's in our diets and our tissues than we do trans fats. But the question is, and it's a question on which the health of New York and the rest of the nation turns, is if the presence of those trans fats in these partially hydrogenated oils that is causing our health problems, or the absence of the omega-3s. Only really well controlled studies can distinguish between these two alternatives. Meanwhile, we already of know of numerous mechanisms whereby a lack of omega-3s and an overabundance of 6s can lead to heart disease and other problems, including the fact that important cell messengers called prostaglandins are much less like to cause inflammation and much less likely to cause blood clotting when they're made from omega-3s than when they're from omega-6s. And we also know that adequate amounts of the longest omega-3, DHA, in heart muscle cells, prevent those cells from developing abnormal rhythms or arrhythmia, which is one of the two causes, along with clotting or thrombosis, of cardiac death. DHA is also found, we now know, in especially high concentrations in all the tissues in our body with the highest activity or metabolic rate. Now I'm not saying that trans fats are good, but they certainly don't lead to disease by the very well defined mechanisms that we know that a lack of omega-3s and an abundance of omega-6s leads to disease. And if you -PALCA: We're talking about - we're talking about fats this hour with Susie Allport. She's the author of a new book on omega-3s. Sorry to interrupt you. I had to jump in a bit. Yes, you're such a -Ms. ALLPORT: I gave you such a - I gave you such a mouthful, but let -FALCOW: You were getting ready. But I have to stop you for a second and remind people that what we're taking about and I'm Joe Palca and this is TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. All right. Now -Ms. ALLPORT:  Okay, can I just finish this, though. All right. Okay. Okay. PALCA: Finish quickly because I have to get a response soon. Go ahead. Ms. ALLPORT: But if the ban would results in restaurants using that are even richer in omega-6s, as many of these restaurants are, then the health problem are only going to increase. And we'll be in even hotter water, or oil, as the case may be. PALCA: All right, all right. We got the joke, and it's bad. Ms. ALLPORT: Yeah, it's -PALCA: So now, let's turn quickly - we'll turn to Dr. Mozaffarian, and I mean - is this an area of - something that you are familiar with, this whole notion of omega-3s and the balance between them and omega-6 acids? Dr. MOZAFFARIAN: Well, you know, omega-3s are actually another significant area of my research. I've maybe done more on omega-3s than trans, so I know quite a bit about the omega-3 story. And first of all, I agree completely that the lack of omega-3s in the U. S. diet is a major risk factor for disease and it's just as important, if not more important than the trans fats. But a couple of things were sort of not exactly correct in what Susan said. First, there are sort of separate risk factors. So low omega-3 is a risk factor and high-trans is a risk factor. And carefully controlled studies have controlled for both of those things. And they're independent separate risk factor - whether you look a dietary intake or membrane levels. So it's really two separate problems. And she's also correct that partial hydrogenation destroys the omega-3s in, for example, soybean oil. And so getting rid of that hydrogenation would not only get rid of the trans but add to the omega-3. So I agree that low omega-3s is a problem, but that doesn't change the issue related to trans fat. PALCA: Okay. Don't answer - don't response, Susan, because we're going to keep you on the phone -Ms. ALLPORT: Okay, Joe. PALCA: But I will ask Shiela Weiss, because I know we're going to say goodbye to her in just minute. Any thoughts about the omega-3 issue, or is that - because that's the next set of hearing that you go. I can't really come up with the omega-3 issue, yes. No. Okay. Ms. WEISS: No. PALCA: Now, all right. Well, that's fine. I'd just figure I'd better give you a chance to say something. All right, well, Dr. Mozaffarian and I want to say thank you for that - I don't want to get into a debate here between, you know, the varying values of each, but we are going to go on for the rest of this hour and talk some more about where omega-3s - where the evidence for them came from, so what saying is thank you very much for joining us and at least getting us started in the direction on that discussion. Dr. MOZAFFARIAN: You're welcome. More omega-3s, less trans, I'm all for it. PALCA: There you go. I finally see that we're started from the right place. And I'd also like to thank Shiela Cohen Weiss. She's a registered dietician and director of Nutrition Policy with the National Restaurant Association. Thanks for joining us. Ms. WEISS: Well, thank you for having me. PALCA: And let me just also add that Dr. Mozaffarian is at the Harvard Medical School and Harvard School of Public Health. And Susie Allport, you stay put because we're going to talk about your book and where omega-3s came from. Ms. ALLPORT: Great. PALCA: Stay with us. (Soundbite of music) PALCO: And we're talking this hour about fat and we're switching from trans fat and omega-6 fat and we're zeroing in on omega-3 fat. Susan Allport is the author of The Queen of Fats: Why Omega-3s Were Removed From The Western Diet and What We Can Do To Replace Them, out this year from the University of California Press. So, Susie, when we left, we were getting into that big discussion about trans fat and omega-3s. But what I want to turn to now is this whole question of when people realize that omega-3s, first of all, were different from omega-6s and that they might have, you know, these are classifications of drugs and again, it goes back to this issue of bonds that we were talking about. But maybe tell us the difference between omega-3 and omega-6 and when people started first to realize that they should be thinking about omega-3 fatty acids. Ms. ALLPORT: All different question the first time. I'm sorry they have given you such a big mouthful before -PALCA: That's all right. Ms. ALLPORT: - but when they first realized that omega-3s were important were when two Danish researchers went to Greenland to investigate rumors that they had heard about the Eskimo having very little heart disease despite the fact they eat tons of fatty seal and whale. And when they analyzed the tissues of the Eskimos, as well as the tissues of the foods that they ate, they found that those foods were extremely rich in certain long chain omega-3 fatty acids. These are DHA - people are familiar with that one, and EPA, eicosapentanoic acid - were far greater in the tissues of the Eskimos, maybe seven times greater than they were in the tissues of Danes that ate lots of cheeses and meats. And people didn't realize that that was very significant and tell this story hooked up with the prostaglandin story. And the prostaglandins are important cell messengers that were discovered to be made from unsaturated fats, the fats that are in the membranes themselves, the fats that were being spoken about before. And they're taken out of the membranes, and they're used as messengers to affect the behavior of cells surrounding them. So these prostaglandins are - affect everything from inflammation to blood clotting to cell death to cell - to blood pressure - all these different, very important parameters. And the Danish researchers knew about this and everybody knew that these messengers were made from an omega-6 fat called arachidonic acid. And they said, well, we wonder if maybe this fat that we found in the Eskimos could also be turned into these messengers. And indeed, it was. So you have these contrasting fats in our cell membranes, one of which if it's snipped out, it causes inflammation, the other one causes much, much, less inflammation. Now what - where the story really gets interesting is where people began to realize where these fats originate. As it turns out that the omega-3s originate not in fish, as most of us believe, but in the green leaves of plants. They are the primary fats in the chloroplasts of green leaves. And there, they enable the plants to carry out photosynthesis - the capturing of photons to be turned into carbohydrates, which is the basis of all life on earth and which is the speediest activity that plants carry out. And then, you have the second family of fats, which are much more predominant in the seeds of plants. And those are the omega-6s. And there, they are turned into omega-3s at the time of germination, but they're much less susceptible to oxidation so plants can store them in their seeds and they're not going to go off as quickly as those omega-3s. PALCA: Oxidation, in other words, they get rancid or they -Ms. ALLPORT: Yeah, they get rancid. They are turned. So they're - and that's why those omega-3s are a problem for the food producers because they are more easily oxidized because they have these extra double bonds. PALCA: Right. Right. Ms. ALLPORT: They've got extra double bonds all the way through, and there's this one extra double bond way at the end of the molecule, which is right in the middle of a cell membrane. And that gives that membrane all kinds of flexibility, which allows all the enzymes and the proteins in that membrane to move much more quickly and rapidly and to send signals to nerve signals, as they do in brains, to capture light molecules as they do in the eye, to beat regularly in the heart. So that's where this story is really interesting, that it's this contrast between the fats of the seeds, the fats that predominate in seeds and the fats that predominate in leaves. And that's the story that we've slowly been putting together over many years. PALCA: Well, let's take a call now from one of our listeners about this, because I'm sure there's a lot of questions, and let's go to John in Adrian, Michigan. John, welcome to the program. JOHN (Caller): Hello. PALCA: Hello. JOHN: Yes. I have a question about - my mother would never use lard, but she had to admit that - one of my ancient aunts, long gone, used lard to make pie crusts, and they were superior pie crusts, and in fact I've heard this from a lot of other people, that the only way to make pie crust is to use lard. Now, where does this fit into the equation? PALCA: Okay, what about that, Suzie Allport? Ms. ALLPORT: Well, it's so interesting because a pig that's out in the wild or is pasture fed, free range pig is going to be pulling up lots of roots and eating lots of greens or insects that have eaten green, and its fats are actually going to be richer in these omega-3s than the fats of a corn fed, grain fed pig. And its fats could actually be a lot healthier for you than the very high omega-6 fats that we have been using instead of those more natural fats ever since we got this story into our head that we needed to reduce animal fats, which was a misguided notion. Animals really are what they eat, just as we are what they eat, and once we understand this idea that the real key is this difference between fats of leaves, fats of seed, that one speeds you up, one slows you down, we'll be able to put all these other stories into place. We'll be able to see that the trans-fat really is about eliminating those fats of the leaves, that the fish story -we're in a real quandary now because we've been told that our way of beefing up on the omega-3 fats is to eat fish, but we're running out of fish, fish are contaminated. If we know, if we really understand that it's the fats of leaves where those fish fats are coming from, then we'll have many other ways of making up for this nutritional deficiency, which is a very important one, which you know, everyone recognizes the omega-3 story. PALCA: I think it's time for a high kelp diet. Ms. ALLPORT: Yes. PALCA: But anyways -Ms. ALLPORT: Right, right. PALCA: Let's take another call now and go to Carl in Tracy, California. Carl, welcome to the program. CARL (Caller): (Unintelligible). PALCA: Uh-oh, we're having a little trouble hearing you there, Carl, hold on a second. Is it something I've done? I'm sorry, that's not working. Sorry, Carl, I guess we didn't hear you there. Let's try another call, and how about going to Rachael, in Phoenix, Arizona. Rachel, welcome to the program. RACHAEL (Caller): Oh, thank you so much for taking my call. This is a validation that you have this program, because I've been obsessing about partially hydrogenated oil and omegas for years. PALCA: Good. RACHEL: But I just wanted to ask is there a way - I'm not sure if this guest knows this answer to this question - but is there a way to counteract the partially hydrogenated oil that's already in your system? Through nutrition, through exercise - I was just curious about that. PALCA: Interesting question. Suzie, can you address that? Ms. ALLPORT: Yeah. Over time, all those fats will be replaced by healthier fats if you just start right now from this day consuming fats with no trans in them and consuming fats with a better ratio of 3s to 6s. PALCA: Okay. Ms. ALLPORT: Just over time, those fats will work their way out of your system. It may take a while, depending on how much of the partially hydrogenated oils you've been eating, but it doesn't sound like a lot. PALCA: Okay. Let's try another call now from Phil in Eugene, Oregon. Phil, welcome to the program. PHIL (Caller): Hi, thanks for having me on. PALCA: Sure. PHIL: I enjoy this program every week. Many decades ago, in fact, I read some simple advice that said the harder the fat is, the stiffer the fat is at body temperature, the worse it is for you, the more likely it is to stick in your arteries, and the softer it is, the runnier it is, the safer it is for you and the better it is for you. That seems to cover all the cases that have been discussed today. Is that still good advice? PALCA: Suzie? Ms. ALLPORT: Yeah, it's very good advice up to a point, because the 6s, the omega-6s and the omega-3s look about the same. They both have about the same melting points, so you can't distinguish them on the melting points and that's interesting. They actually have some - there are some additional chemical properties that they have with these certain kind of double bonds, which I won't go into now but that makes them more valuable - that makes the 3s more valuable than the 6s, even though they'll both be liquids at pretty much the same temperature. PALCA: Okay, that's good. Let's take one more call now, from Andy in Utah. Andy, welcome to the program. ANDY (Caller): Hello. PALCA: Hello. ANDY: I was just wondering, I did take flax seed, and I put it in yogurt, and then take a flax seed oil pill. Am I doing myself any good? Ms. ALLPORT: You're doing yourself great. You could also, you know - I don't know what kinds of oils you cook with, but if you reduce the amount of really high omega-6 oils, you'll give those omega-3s a better chance of getting into your tissues. ANDY: Okay, so if I take a flax oil pill that's manufactured and then I take raw flax seed and put it in my yogurt. So which would be the best, or -Ms. ALLPORT: Oh, any of those. You know, I mean, you can get these omega-3s from a variety of means. Flax seed is great, but as I said you should also pay attention to what oil you're using in the cooking, and if it's safflower, sunflower, those really high omega-6 oils, they'll swamp those omega-3s in that flax-seed pill, if you're using that, so yeah. ANDY: We cook in mostly olive oil. PALCA: Yeah. Ms. ALLPORT: Olive oil is good, Canola oil. Yup, those are good oils to cook with. PALCA: Hey, Suzie you know what - and thanks, Andy. You know what? I was wondering. This whole - a lot of kids, when they were - well not kids, but people closer to my age, probably, who when they were young were forced to eat cod liver oil - is that, I mean, is that thought to be good? That was supposed to be high in omega-3. Ms. ALLPORT: Yeah, it's very high in omega-3s, and it's interesting, though, because a lot of that oil that we were given tasted awful and it tasted awful because it was oxidized, and oxidized oils aren't good for you whether they're high in omega-3s or not, so it may have been of some benefit if it was fresh and your mother thought to keep it in the refrigerator. But if she didn't, it probably didn't help us too much. But yes, that's a really interesting phenomenon. PALCA: We're talking with Suzie Allport, or Susan Allport, the author of The Queen of Fats: Why Omega-3s Were Removed from the Western Diet and What We Can Do to Replace Them. I'm Joe Palca and you're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. And I want to get to the other part of the title of your book. Why were Omega-3s removed from the Western diet? What was that? Was it all just convenience because they wanted to keep things on shelves longer and they couldn't use these oils that became rancid faster? Ms. ALLPORT: Right. I mean, that's where they connect with this trans story is because when those oils - you know, the omega-3s are in seeds in varying degrees, and there they really present a problem for the food producers because they are the things that are the most readily oxidized. So they came up - first of all, they totally hydrogenated these oils. That began at the beginning of the 20th century, and they eliminated any of the polyunsaturates, and then they decided that no, that they would just eliminate the omega-3s and leave the omega-6s because by that time, they knew that omega-6s were essential for health. They didn't know that the 3s were essential for health. So then they came up on that technique of partial hydrogenation, and that created more 6s and trans, removed the 3s. Well, it's very hard to distinguish which is causing the problems, the 6s or the trans. But then they were also -the title says they were removed, but in reality they've been swamped by the amount of 6s in our diet. That has really soared over the past 100 years or so from seven grams a day per person to about 16 or 20 grams per person a day, and that's what the biggest change has been. Trans has gone up since the \u201840s and \u201850s, and the spike has been parallel, but it's at a much lower level. PALCA: Okay. I think we have time for one more call, so let's go to Catherine in Oxford, Mississippi. Catherine, welcome to the program. CATHERINE (Caller): Thank you for having me. PALCA: Sure. CATHERINE: Actually, what I want to ask is being a vegetarian who doesn't eat anything with eyes or antennae, including fish, what's the best way I can get some omega-3s without taking supplements. And I'll take my call off the air. Thank you. PALCA: Okay, thanks, Catherine. Ms. ALLPORT: Well, you can always add flax seed to your breads, and you can use Canola oil for your baking, because Canola happens to have a really good ratio of the two fats. And another great way is to eat the omega-3 enriched eggs, and these are eggs from chickens that have been given a diet that is rich in omega-3s, it could be either flax seed or it could be algae or it could be fishmeal, and the chickens put those omega-3s into their eggs for the same reason that they're in the breast milk of women. It's to provide for the brain development in the next generation. In the case of chickens, it's the chicks. In the case of women, it's the child. But they're there for that reason, and it's a really good way to get those. An egg from a chicken that is a free ranging chicken that's out there just foraging on its own, eating as many worms as it wants and picking up all the greens that it wants, will have as many omega-3s in it as a piece of fish, which is an astonishing thing. So by changing that part of our food supply, changing the eggs and the nutrient content of those eggs, we've really made a very major change. PALCA: Okay, very briefly, very briefly -Ms. ALLPORT: Yeah, okay. PALCA: Have you changed your diet? Ms. ALLPORT: I have changed my diet. I have changed my diet, and I've even had my blood tested from some of these companies that have given me free tests. And after three or four years of changing my diet, I'm about at the level of a Mediterranean or Greek. I'm not down to where the Japanese are, who eat even more fish. PALCA: I see. Well, all right. I guess some day I'll have to come and have dinner with you, and you can tell me what the right thing to do is. Ms. ALLPORT: Oh please do, please do. PALCA: Anyway, Suzie Allport, thanks very much for joining me today. Ms. ALLPORT: Thank you, thank you. PALCA: Susan Allport is a science writer. Her new book is The Queen of Fats: Why Omega-3s Were Removed from the Western Diet and What We Can Do to Replace Them.  JOE PALCA, host:  This is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. I'm Joe Palca in for Ira Flatow.  New York City wants to get the fat out of your diet, or, more specifically, the trans fat. The city health department is proposing that restaurants drastically reduce the amount of trans fats in the foods they serve. The reason for this shift is that a diet high in trans fats is associated with heart disease, and possibly other ailments as well.  In this hour we'll talk about the evidence for the dangers trans fats pose, and we'll also talk about whether requiring restaurants to cut back on trans fats will have the desired effect on the health of New Yorkers and others who visit the Big Apple.  And we'd like to have your thoughts on the subject, so give us a call. Our number is 1-800-989-8255. That's 1-800-989-TALK. And if you want more information about what we'll be talking about this hour, go to our Web site at www. sciencefriday. com.  Now let me introduce my first guests. Dariush Mozaffarian is a cardiologist and instructor at the Harvard Medical School and Harvard School of Public Health. He's written a review article that was recently published in the New England Journal of Medicine about trans fats and heart disease. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY, Dr. Mozaffarian.  Dr. DARIUSH MOZAFFARIAN (Cardiologist Harvard Medical School): Thank you. Good afternoon.  PALCA: Good afternoon. And also here with me in Studio 3A is Sheila Cohn Weiss. She's a registered dietician and director of nutrition policy at the National Restaurant Association. Thanks for coming in.  Ms. SHEILA COHN WEISS (Director of Nutrition Policy, National Restaurant Association): Oh, thank you for having me.  PALCA: Well, so maybe, Dr. Mozaffarian, we can start with you. And let's get some definitions going here to begin with what is a trans fat?  Dr. MOZAFFARIAN: Well, the word trans refers to the type of double bond it has. All fatty acids that are not saturated have double bonds, and trans is a certain kind of double bond that's generally not present in nature. Mammals don't make trans bonds, for example. And very small amounts are present naturally in some foods, but the type of bond is really only seen in foods that are produced or prepared with partially hydrogenated vegetable oils.  PALCA: Yeah. You know, I want to go a little further. I don't mean to make this into a whole big definition thing, but what does it mean - I guess everybody's heard this, you know, saturated fats and polyunsaturated fats - but what does that mean, a saturated fat?  Dr. MOZAFFARIAN: Well, so all fats are strings of carbon molecules connected by bonds, and if there are hydrogens on those carbons and there's no double bonds, then the type of fatty acid is called saturated.  PALCA: Mm-hmm.  Dr. MOZAFFARIAN: If there's double bonds between the carbons, so they have fewer hydrogens, then they become unsaturated. And if there's just one unsaturated bond, it's a monounsaturated fat, such as seen in olive oil.  PALCA: Mm-hmm.  Dr. MOZAFFARIAN: And if it has multiple double bonds, it's a polyunsaturated fat, such as found in vegetable oils. And the trans bond, the trans refers to the orientation of those hydrogen bonds - of those hydrogen molecules - excuse me - around the double bond. If they're on the same side of the double bond, it becomes trans. And then what that does is it alters the physical properties of the fatty acid.  And, you know, that's in fact in some ways why this was developed in the first place, because you can take an oil that's liquid at room temperature, like soybean oil or safflower oil, and you can partially hydrogenate it, add these trans bonds, and you make it solid or semi-solid at room temperature. So you're actually altering the chemical properties of a fatty acid by altering the type of bond it has.  PALCA: Got it. And I'm going to take a stab from my organic chemistry - which I'm sure has changed enormously since I learned it - but anyway, bonds are what attach the carbon molecules to each other and what the - how the hydrogen attaches to the carbon. But the carbon has this unique property that it can have not just one bond but two bonds connecting the same two carbons. Did I do that right?  Dr. MOZAFFARIAN: Correct. Yes.  Ms. WEISS: Yes.  PALCA: All right. Through the uprights. Thank you very much. Okay, so then the question is why would the - what would be the evidence or why would a trans fat be worse for you than a cis fat or a polyunsaturated fat?  Dr. MOZAFFARIAN: Well, those are two different questions.  PALCA: Okay.  Dr. MOZAFFARIAN: You know, sort of the why and what the evidence is.  PALCA: Okay.  Dr. MOZAFFARIAN: The why I think is very interesting and, you know, what makes nutritional - the study of nutrition so interesting. You know, we think we -traditionally, a person might think of fats as just a carrier of calories. You know, that's what I eat it as calories. It gets into my fat cells. But really fats are what make us multi-cellular. If we didn't have fat, we wouldn't have cells because all of the cells, the membranes of the cells, are mostly fat molecules.  And so the way the cells of our body interact with each other is determined by the composition of that membrane. And so different fatty acids in the membrane alter the way the different cells function and communicate with each other. And so, you know, when you eat trans fats, it gets taken up into your membranes, of all the membranes of the body, and has different effects on different cells and different organ systems.  PALCA: Mm-hmm. Okay. Well, let me turn to Sheila Cohn Weiss here in the studio. First of all, as someone who's interested in nutrition, I mean do we need trans fats, or are they just a modern convenience that turns out to be not so good for us?  Ms. WEISS: Well, it all started in the early '70s and '80s, when scientific research and consumer demand pushed our industry and the food industry away from saturated fats, and we started to use partially hydrogenated oils, which obviously contained trans fats, to use as a substitute. And they have shown to have longer shelf life, provide crispiness to food products and provide a desirable mouth feel.  Now as we all know and as was just discussed, recent research shows over the last several years that trans fats, along with saturated fats and dietary cholesterol, do contribute to coronary heart disease. And that is the reason why, over the last several years, our industry has been making great strides to move away from oils containing trans fats in order to find other alternatives.  PALCA: But is - I mean is it just convenience, or is it price? Is there a reason not to just say, oh, well, let's get rid of them all together if they're not good for you?  Ms. WEISS: Well, moving away from trans fats has proven to be a challenge for our industry. There are many reasons for that. One of the main reasons is that of supply.  PALCA: Mm-hmm.  Ms. WEISS: There currently is not enough supply for all of our nation's restaurants to move away from partially hydrogenated vegetable oils. In addition, it takes a great deal of testing. A lot of restaurants have moved away and have made great strides, but in doing so it's taken them upwards of two years to find the appropriate substitute, one that provides adequate shelf life, that will maintain the taste and quality of the foods that were prepared before with trans fat oil.  PALCA: Okay. Well, let's see if we can get our listeners to come in on this conversation, and let's go first to Louise(ph) in Paradise, California. Louise, welcome to the program.  LOUISE (Caller): Yes, hi.  PALCA: Hi.  LOUISE: I am - have eaten - I'm a person who has eaten a lot of trans fat in the form of Crisco and margarine and baked goods all my life.  PALCA: Mm-hmm.  LOUISE: And the thing is that I discovered about five years ago when I developed very severe colon problems was that - I was led to research this subject a lot and discovered that the - it not only accumulates in the coronary arteries, as they've discovered, but it also is layering in the colon and known as bucoid(ph) plaque.  PALCA: Huh. Well, Louise, let me see what Dr. Mozaffarian has to say about that. Have you any evidence or have you seen any evidence that it's more than just the coronary arteries that are a problem from trans fats?  Dr. MOZAFFARIAN: Well, you know, the - I think it's important, first of all, to not lump trans fats together with saturated fats or dietary cholesterol because the strength of the evidence and the size of the effect, calorie for calorie, there's really no comparison. It's - trans fats are pretty much an additive to foods, where, you know, saturated fats are naturally found in meats and dairy products.  PALCA: Mm-hmm.  Dr. MOZAFFARIAN: In terms of different conditions that are affected, there's very strong evidence for coronary heart disease. There's good evidence for sudden cardiac death, which is, you know, when someone sort of dies, suddenly keels over on the street. There's growing evidence for diabetes and maybe weight gain. I have not seen strong evidence for colon disease but, you know, as a cardiologist, that's not my main area of research. There may have been some studies that I'm unaware of.  PALCA: Yeah. But let me just ask you then, what was your - I know you testified at a hearing earlier this week about the New York City plans - what do you think they should do? Or what - do you think their plans are good ones, to reduce over the next 18 months what restaurants are permitted to serve?  Dr. MOZAFFARIAN: Well, you know, my testimony focused on the science, on the harmful effects and the magnitude of the effect. But I think that, you know, the New York initiative is a very sensible initiative. They're giving time to the restaurants. They're, you know, allowing some small levels of trans fats, and, you know, there's certainly enough supply in the world to supply New York City to make these changes. It's going to be invisible to the consumers. It's not going to increase cost or change taste. They're not banning any foods. It's just changing sort of the additives in the foods. And so I think as a matter of food safety, the policy makes sense.  PALCA: What's - what about you, Sheila Weiss? What does the National Restaurant Association feel about New York's plans?  Ms. WEISS: Well, I also was testified on Monday at the public hearing in New York City, and I think to begin with - I mean, like I said, there are many, many aspects of the ban that we do not agree with, and what came up many times is that of supply. Now the product, for example - and we've worked a lot with our industry partners on this - and to begin with, the New York City restaurant - the New York City ban takes a very narrow approach by looking at one item. And like I mentioned before, the issue of supply is one that we have faced. It's - many people have said that supply isn't a problem, but. . .  PALCA: So this is supply as an alternative to what's being used today.  Ms. WEISS: Yes.  PALCA: Okay.  Ms. WEISS: Yes, alternative oils.  PALCA: I see.  Ms. WEISS: For example, many restaurants are looking to low-linolenic soybean oil. And we have found that the production of low-linolenic soybean oil in the United States for 2006 is estimated to be about 400 million pounds of oil. But one quick-service restaurant alone in our country is estimated to use about 330 million pounds of oil each year, so that. . .  PALCA: So quick service is what the Restaurant Association refers to what we mostly think of as fast-food restaurants?  Ms. WEISS: Yes, absolutely.  PALCA: Okay, good. All right. So there's just a problem there.  Ms. WEISS: Yes.  PALCA: Okay. Well, we're going to spend quite a bit of the next hour talking about that and what remedies there might be for that, so please all listeners stay with us. And we'd like to take your calls at 1-800-989-8255. That's 1-800-989-TALK. And we'll be back after a short break to talk more about trans fats and other kinds of fats. Stay with us.  (Soundbite of music)  PALCA: From NPR News, this is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Joe Palca.  We're talking this hour about trans fats, and my guests are Dariush Mozaffarian - he's a cardiologist at the Harvard Medical School and Harvard School of Public Health in Boston - and Sheila Cohn Weiss, she's a registered dietician who is the director of nutrition policy at the National Restaurant Association.  And let me introduce now my next guest. Gale Brewer is a member of the New York City Council. She represents District 6, which covers the Upper West Side and Lincoln Center. That's my old stomping ground. I used to live around there. Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY, Ms. Brewer.  Ms. GALE BREWER (District 6, New York City Council): Thank you very much.  PALCA: So we've been talking about the department of health's plans to cut - to require restaurants to cut back on the amount of foods they serve containing trans fats. What do you think about this plan?  Ms. BREWER: Well, I certainly have a lot of restaurants, as you suggest, in my district, and obviously we have thousands in New York City, but I think it's a good idea. I've certainly talked to some of the owners of restaurants on the West Side, and I think they do feel it is the wave of the future.  PALCA: Mm-hmm.  Ms. BREWER: However, we also have large and we have smaller ethnic restaurants, and we do need a little bit more time than the commissioner may have in mind, and a little bit more education in terms of some of the smaller restaurants. I know the commissioner of health in New York City hopes to vote on the proposal by the board of health December of 2006, and then within, you know, six months - July 2007 - try to have the removal of some of these trans fats but. . .  PALCA: But. . .  Ms. BREWER: . . . it's a short time period.  PALCA: Sure, I understand. But you're convinced by the evidence that we've heard from Dr. Mozaffarian and others that there is a need to do this.  Ms. BREWER: I would agree. I mean there are issues to work out. That's why, you know, challenges remain and education is needed. For instance, out-of-state foods, baked foods, will continue to be sold. And we all love New Jersey, but we want New York City products to be purchased. . .  PALCA: Mm-hmm.  Ms. BREWER: . . . and, you know, sometimes within the kosher community - bakeries, caterers and so on - they're going to have to find alternatives that are par because they need to be neutral, not to contain dairy products, as you probably know.  PALCA: Sure.  Ms. BREWER: So there are issues that need to be addressed.  PALCA: Well, let me just ask you. This proposal only relates to restaurants - and it's nice that people can go out to restaurants, and I suppose a lot of food is served in restaurants - but certainly most people get the bulk of the food from what they buy in the grocery stores, and there's no limitations being placed on that. So are you missing a big opportunity to have an impact here? Or is it just that you don't have jurisdiction to say no trans fats?  Ms. BREWER: It's jurisdictional. The bodegas and delis, for instance, as long as food is prepared where their revenue is less than 50 percent - and certainly farmers' markets, which we love - they're both overseen by the New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets.  PALCA: I see. Okay. Well, let's continue to hear what our listeners have to say, and we'd like to hear from you. Our number is 800-989-8255, and let's go to Robert in Rochester, New York. Robert, welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY.  ROBERT (Caller): Hello. Hello?  PALCA: Hello.  ROBERT: Yes, I was wondering how the trans fats in the meat section of the stores - I don't go out to restaurants that often, so I'm mainly concerned about the food that I buy, and a lot of them these days do have the trans fat, nutritional amounts, if any. . .  PALCA: Huh.  ROBERT: . . . either zero. I have a substitute butter. I don't think you'd call it margarine, but it has one gram percentage of daily serving.  PALCA: Uh-huh.  ROBERT: Now what is one gram of trans fat in terms of your total nutrition and its effect on your health?  PALCA: Well, let me ask Dr. Mozaffarian that. There's a table in your article talking about the amount of trans fats in food, and I guess one gram is kind of on the low end of the amounts that you would find in most food servings. Is that right?  Dr. MOZAFFARIAN: Well, I - you know, the first question: Are there trans fats in the meat section? You know, most - if a food doesn't contain partially hydrogenated oils, it'll contain very, very little or no trans fats. So it's really just foods that are made with partially hydrogenated oils. And, you know, in contrast to restaurants, when you go to the grocery store, you can look at the label and, you know, make a choice about different foods.  PALCA: Mm-hmm.  Dr. MOZAFFARIAN: One gram per serving represents - well, let's put it this way. Risk is seen with trans fats at very, very low levels of intake, so even three or four grams per day might increase risk of heart disease. So - and that's very different from, you know, other nutrients. So one gram per serving of margarine, if you have a couple of servings in the day and then you, you know, eat something else that might have it and you eat something else, it adds up very quickly. So since there are products that can be chosen that have no trans fats, I think it's prudent and it makes sense to, you know, go and find a different butter substitute that has zero rather than the one that has one.  PALCA: Got it. Okay, let's take another call now from Byron in Jacksonville, Florida. Byron, welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY.  BYRON (Caller): Hi. Hey, Joe. Friday's my favorite day. I love this show.  (Soundbite of laughter)  PALCA: Great.  BYRON: I think that the consumer should be able to make that choice. I grew up - my mother drilled into me: everything in moderation, nothing in excess. We should - if you want to put it on the menu, hey, this has trans fats in it. I look forward to going to a Chinese restaurant and loading up on bad food, but I do it every two or three weeks. I think it's ridiculous that you're saying - that Gale is saying, oh, we shouldn't even sell this. Label it. Let the consumer decide. That's the only way it should be. Where do we draw the line? Too much sugar in my sweet tea? I live in the South. We put bacon grease in our turnip greens.  (Soundbite of laughter)  BYRON: It's delicious. I don't eat it everyday.  PALCA: I see.  BYRON: Thank you.  PALCA: Okay, well, maybe we should let Gale Brewer have a response to that. Why not just label things and tell people what they're in for and not dictate to them how they're supposed to be fed?  Ms. BREWER: Well, I mean I think what happens in New York is we have actually a very good experience with the no-smoking law where people really understood it after it was passed. There was a lot of fuss before it was passed. And, you know, the people who are working in the restaurants feel better and it hasn't turned out to be a big challenge in terms of street noise, people smoking outside.  PALCA: Yeah.  Ms. BREWER: It's very positive health-wise. And I think as, you know, a legislator and as the commissioner of health has said, we need to be thinking about public health. It is true; people in their homes can cook and use, you know, right now any one of these ingredients. And the fact of the matter is, though, restaurants, I think when you go you're not sure, spending time looking up on the board, as to what the ingredients are. These restaurants are sometimes small. I don't know how accurate the boards could be kept, and I think that, you know, the least we can do is a city concerned about public health, people living longer and having healthier lives.  It's also, to be honest with you, a situation where we have, you know, thousands of different, wonderful ethnic restaurants, and it would be very difficult in language and space to list all the different ingredients. It's my opinion, having talked to restaurateurs today, owners of ethnic restaurants, that in many cases they have already gotten rid of trans fat. The consumer doesn't know and the food is equally delicious.  PALCA: All right. Gale Brewer. . .  Dr. MOZAFFARIAN: Can I. . .  PALCA: . . . thanks very much for joining us today. Gale Brewer is a member of the New York City Council, representing District 6.  Ms. BREWER: Thank you very much.  PALCA: You're welcome. And, Dr. Mozaffarian, you wanted to add something.  Dr. MOZAFFARIAN: Yeah, I also wanted to respond to that. I think that, you know, it's not really a question of regulating what people eat or deciding what people can and can't eat. There's going to be no change in the food that a person eats. It's really a question of an additive to the foods, and I think the example that the New York Department of Public Health used, which is appropriate, is the example of lead in paint. You know, lead was added to paint. We saw it was a danger. You can take the lead out of paint and still have paint, and so, you know, it's a safety measure.  You know, by the most conservative estimates, about 1,400 heart attack deaths each year in New York are due to trans fats, so that's over 100 New Yorkers killed per month. I think that, you know, that's a - if it can be removed without any effect on choice, on price, on taste, which the evidence suggests it can, then why should we have it in the food?  PALCA: Well, I just want to turn to Sheila Cohn Weiss. I mean do you agree that this needs to be mandated, or, like the caller said, it's enough to let people know? I mean would the restaurant industry be happy just informing people who cared enough to ask?  Ms. WEISS: Well, I think, first of all, I wanted to say I'm really glad that Councilman Brewer was on - was part of this discussion to bring to light from New York City what is actually going on. And I think that we can agree that the outcome of the board of health and New York state - New York City - as well as the restaurant industry, seeks the same. We all want to move away from trans fat and oils.  I'm not here to say that trans fats are healthy or to dispute those aspects of this discussion. I'm here to talk about what the restaurant industry is doing, as well as the challenges we face. Councilman Brewer brought up some - Councilwoman Brewer, excuse me - brought up some really good points about how the restaurants in New York City need more time and need more education.  A year ago, the New York City Department of Health says that they sent out brochures to their city's restaurants. Well, when we talked to our members in New York City, very few of them had actually received anything from the Board of Health. And many of them did not, were not contacted by inspectors or by members of the Board to discuss this issue and to talk about how to seek alternatives.  So I think taking a step and actually talking to the restaurant operators about how they can make this change is really important in this move.  PALCA: Okay. Well, we've been talking about a family of fats that are pretty widely considered to be bad for you. And now, I'd to introduce, sort of welcome to the program someone with a good perspective or an interesting perspective on the a whole other class of fats and whether maybe it's their absence rather than the presence of something else is part of the problem.  So joining me now is Susan Allport. She's a science writer in New York City at New York State. And her new book is The Queen of Fats: Why Omega-3s Were Removed from the Western Diet and what we can do to replace them. She joins us today from NPR's New York bureau. And welcome to Science Friday.  It says here Ms. Allport, but I can't think of her that way because Susie Allport and I went to college together once upon a time.  Ms. SUSAN ALLPORT (Science writer): That's correct.  PALCA: So it's going to have to be to Susie. I can't do anything about that. I'm sorry. Welcome, Susie.  Ms. ALLPORT: Right. Hi, Joe. Thanks so much for having me on to speak on this subject.  PALCA: Nice to talk to you. We haven't spoken in a long time.  Ms. ALLPORT: Yeah, nice to - I know.  PALCA: So - but what about this? I mean, are we focusing our wrath in the wrong place?  Ms. ALLPORT: I think so. I have such a different perspective on trans fats and it's one - it's a perspective that connect the trans fats story to the much more important omega-3 story. And it's a perspective that we absolutely have to understand if this ban is actually going to improve the health of New Yorkers.  Just backing up a little bit. Trans fats, as we all know, are formed when vegetable oils are partially hydrogenated to make them more stable and solid. But what most people don't know is that this process selectively eliminates the omega-3s in these fats, turning them into trans fats as well as omega-6s. And that's a second family of fats that are also essential but that compete with the omega-3s for enzyme in cell membranes.  By the way, we have many more of these six's in our diets and our tissues than we do trans fats. But the question is, and it's a question on which the health of New York and the rest of the nation turns, is if the presence of those trans fats in these partially hydrogenated oils that is causing our health problems, or the absence of the omega-3s. Only really well controlled studies can distinguish between these two alternatives.  Meanwhile, we already of know of numerous mechanisms whereby a lack of omega-3s and an overabundance of 6s can lead to heart disease and other problems, including the fact that important cell messengers called prostaglandins are much less like to cause inflammation and much less likely to cause blood clotting when they're made from omega-3s than when they're from omega-6s.  And we also know that adequate amounts of the longest omega-3, DHA, in heart muscle cells, prevent those cells from developing abnormal rhythms or arrhythmia, which is one of the two causes, along with clotting or thrombosis, of cardiac death. DHA is also found, we now know, in especially high concentrations in all the tissues in our body with the highest activity or metabolic rate.  Now I'm not saying that trans fats are good, but they certainly don't lead to disease by the very well defined mechanisms that we know that a lack of omega-3s and an abundance of omega-6s leads to disease. And if you - PALCA: We're talking about - we're talking about fats this hour with Susie Allport. She's the author of a new book on omega-3s. Sorry to interrupt you. I had to jump in a bit. Yes, you're such a - Ms. ALLPORT: I gave you such a - I gave you such a mouthful, but let - FALCOW: You were getting ready. But I have to stop you for a second and remind people that what we're taking about and I'm Joe Palca and this is TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. All right. Now - Ms. ALLPORT:  Okay, can I just finish this, though. All right. Okay. Okay.  PALCA: Finish quickly because I have to get a response soon. Go ahead.  Ms. ALLPORT: But if the ban would results in restaurants using that are even richer in omega-6s, as many of these restaurants are, then the health problem are only going to increase. And we'll be in even hotter water, or oil, as the case may be.  PALCA: All right, all right. We got the joke, and it's bad.  Ms. ALLPORT: Yeah, it's - PALCA: So now, let's turn quickly - we'll turn to Dr. Mozaffarian, and I mean - is this an area of - something that you are familiar with, this whole notion of omega-3s and the balance between them and omega-6 acids?  Dr. MOZAFFARIAN: Well, you know, omega-3s are actually another significant area of my research. I've maybe done more on omega-3s than trans, so I know quite a bit about the omega-3 story. And first of all, I agree completely that the lack of omega-3s in the U. S. diet is a major risk factor for disease and it's just as important, if not more important than the trans fats. But a couple of things were sort of not exactly correct in what Susan said.  First, there are sort of separate risk factors. So low omega-3 is a risk factor and high-trans is a risk factor. And carefully controlled studies have controlled for both of those things. And they're independent separate risk factor - whether you look a dietary intake or membrane levels. So it's really two separate problems.  And she's also correct that partial hydrogenation destroys the omega-3s in, for example, soybean oil. And so getting rid of that hydrogenation would not only get rid of the trans but add to the omega-3. So I agree that low omega-3s is a problem, but that doesn't change the issue related to trans fat.  PALCA: Okay. Don't answer - don't response, Susan, because we're going to keep you on the phone - Ms. ALLPORT: Okay, Joe.  PALCA: But I will ask Shiela Weiss, because I know we're going to say goodbye to her in just minute. Any thoughts about the omega-3 issue, or is that - because that's the next set of hearing that you go. I can't really come up with the omega-3 issue, yes. No. Okay.  Ms. WEISS: No.  PALCA: Now, all right. Well, that's fine. I'd just figure I'd better give you a chance to say something. All right, well, Dr. Mozaffarian and I want to say thank you for that - I don't want to get into a debate here between, you know, the varying values of each, but we are going to go on for the rest of this hour and talk some more about where omega-3s - where the evidence for them came from, so what saying is thank you very much for joining us and at least getting us started in the direction on that discussion.  Dr. MOZAFFARIAN: You're welcome. More omega-3s, less trans, I'm all for it.  PALCA: There you go. I finally see that we're started from the right place. And I'd also like to thank Shiela Cohen Weiss. She's a registered dietician and director of Nutrition Policy with the National Restaurant Association. Thanks for joining us.  Ms. WEISS: Well, thank you for having me.  PALCA: And let me just also add that Dr. Mozaffarian is at the Harvard Medical School and Harvard School of Public Health. And Susie Allport, you stay put because we're going to talk about your book and where omega-3s came from.  Ms. ALLPORT: Great.  PALCA: Stay with us.  (Soundbite of music)  PALCO: And we're talking this hour about fat and we're switching from trans fat and omega-6 fat and we're zeroing in on omega-3 fat.  Susan Allport is the author of The Queen of Fats: Why Omega-3s Were Removed From The Western Diet and What We Can Do To Replace Them, out this year from the University of California Press.  So, Susie, when we left, we were getting into that big discussion about trans fat and omega-3s. But what I want to turn to now is this whole question of when people realize that omega-3s, first of all, were different from omega-6s and that they might have, you know, these are classifications of drugs and again, it goes back to this issue of bonds that we were talking about. But maybe tell us the difference between omega-3 and omega-6 and when people started first to realize that they should be thinking about omega-3 fatty acids.  Ms. ALLPORT: All different question the first time. I'm sorry they have given you such a big mouthful before - PALCA: That's all right.  Ms. ALLPORT: - but when they first realized that omega-3s were important were when two Danish researchers went to Greenland to investigate rumors that they had heard about the Eskimo having very little heart disease despite the fact they eat tons of fatty seal and whale.  And when they analyzed the tissues of the Eskimos, as well as the tissues of the foods that they ate, they found that those foods were extremely rich in certain long chain omega-3 fatty acids. These are DHA - people are familiar with that one, and EPA, eicosapentanoic acid - were far greater in the tissues of the Eskimos, maybe seven times greater than they were in the tissues of Danes that ate lots of cheeses and meats.  And people didn't realize that that was very significant and tell this story hooked up with the prostaglandin story. And the prostaglandins are important cell messengers that were discovered to be made from unsaturated fats, the fats that are in the membranes themselves, the fats that were being spoken about before.  And they're taken out of the membranes, and they're used as messengers to affect the behavior of cells surrounding them. So these prostaglandins are - affect everything from inflammation to blood clotting to cell death to cell - to blood pressure - all these different, very important parameters. And the Danish researchers knew about this and everybody knew that these messengers were made from an omega-6 fat called arachidonic acid.  And they said, well, we wonder if maybe this fat that we found in the Eskimos could also be turned into these messengers. And indeed, it was. So you have these contrasting fats in our cell membranes, one of which if it's snipped out, it causes inflammation, the other one causes much, much, less inflammation. Now what - where the story really gets interesting is where people began to realize where these fats originate.  As it turns out that the omega-3s originate not in fish, as most of us believe, but in the green leaves of plants. They are the primary fats in the chloroplasts of green leaves. And there, they enable the plants to carry out photosynthesis - the capturing of photons to be turned into carbohydrates, which is the basis of all life on earth and which is the speediest activity that plants carry out.  And then, you have the second family of fats, which are much more predominant in the seeds of plants. And those are the omega-6s. And there, they are turned into omega-3s at the time of germination, but they're much less susceptible to oxidation so plants can store them in their seeds and they're not going to go off as quickly as those omega-3s.  PALCA: Oxidation, in other words, they get rancid or they - Ms. ALLPORT: Yeah, they get rancid. They are turned. So they're - and that's why those omega-3s are a problem for the food producers because they are more easily oxidized because they have these extra double bonds.  PALCA: Right. Right.  Ms. ALLPORT: They've got extra double bonds all the way through, and there's this one extra double bond way at the end of the molecule, which is right in the middle of a cell membrane. And that gives that membrane all kinds of flexibility, which allows all the enzymes and the proteins in that membrane to move much more quickly and rapidly and to send signals to nerve signals, as they do in brains, to capture light molecules as they do in the eye, to beat regularly in the heart.  So that's where this story is really interesting, that it's this contrast between the fats of the seeds, the fats that predominate in seeds and the fats that predominate in leaves. And that's the story that we've slowly been putting together over many years.  PALCA: Well, let's take a call now from one of our listeners about this, because I'm sure there's a lot of questions, and let's go to John in Adrian, Michigan. John, welcome to the program.  JOHN (Caller): Hello.  PALCA: Hello.  JOHN: Yes. I have a question about - my mother would never use lard, but she had to admit that - one of my ancient aunts, long gone, used lard to make pie crusts, and they were superior pie crusts, and in fact I've heard this from a lot of other people, that the only way to make pie crust is to use lard. Now, where does this fit into the equation?  PALCA: Okay, what about that, Suzie Allport?  Ms. ALLPORT: Well, it's so interesting because a pig that's out in the wild or is pasture fed, free range pig is going to be pulling up lots of roots and eating lots of greens or insects that have eaten green, and its fats are actually going to be richer in these omega-3s than the fats of a corn fed, grain fed pig. And its fats could actually be a lot healthier for you than the very high omega-6 fats that we have been using instead of those more natural fats ever since we got this story into our head that we needed to reduce animal fats, which was a misguided notion.  Animals really are what they eat, just as we are what they eat, and once we understand this idea that the real key is this difference between fats of leaves, fats of seed, that one speeds you up, one slows you down, we'll be able to put all these other stories into place. We'll be able to see that the trans-fat really is about eliminating those fats of the leaves, that the fish story -we're in a real quandary now because we've been told that our way of beefing up on the omega-3 fats is to eat fish, but we're running out of fish, fish are contaminated.  If we know, if we really understand that it's the fats of leaves where those fish fats are coming from, then we'll have many other ways of making up for this nutritional deficiency, which is a very important one, which you know, everyone recognizes the omega-3 story.  PALCA: I think it's time for a high kelp diet.  Ms. ALLPORT: Yes.  PALCA: But anyways - Ms. ALLPORT: Right, right.  PALCA: Let's take another call now and go to Carl in Tracy, California. Carl, welcome to the program.  CARL (Caller): (Unintelligible).  PALCA: Uh-oh, we're having a little trouble hearing you there, Carl, hold on a second. Is it something I've done? I'm sorry, that's not working. Sorry, Carl, I guess we didn't hear you there. Let's try another call, and how about going to Rachael, in Phoenix, Arizona. Rachel, welcome to the program.  RACHAEL (Caller): Oh, thank you so much for taking my call. This is a validation that you have this program, because I've been obsessing about partially hydrogenated oil and omegas for years.  PALCA: Good.  RACHEL: But I just wanted to ask is there a way - I'm not sure if this guest knows this answer to this question - but is there a way to counteract the partially hydrogenated oil that's already in your system? Through nutrition, through exercise - I was just curious about that.  PALCA: Interesting question. Suzie, can you address that?  Ms. ALLPORT: Yeah. Over time, all those fats will be replaced by healthier fats if you just start right now from this day consuming fats with no trans in them and consuming fats with a better ratio of 3s to 6s.  PALCA: Okay.  Ms. ALLPORT: Just over time, those fats will work their way out of your system. It may take a while, depending on how much of the partially hydrogenated oils you've been eating, but it doesn't sound like a lot.  PALCA: Okay. Let's try another call now from Phil in Eugene, Oregon. Phil, welcome to the program.  PHIL (Caller): Hi, thanks for having me on.  PALCA: Sure.  PHIL: I enjoy this program every week. Many decades ago, in fact, I read some simple advice that said the harder the fat is, the stiffer the fat is at body temperature, the worse it is for you, the more likely it is to stick in your arteries, and the softer it is, the runnier it is, the safer it is for you and the better it is for you. That seems to cover all the cases that have been discussed today. Is that still good advice?  PALCA: Suzie?  Ms. ALLPORT: Yeah, it's very good advice up to a point, because the 6s, the omega-6s and the omega-3s look about the same. They both have about the same melting points, so you can't distinguish them on the melting points and that's interesting. They actually have some - there are some additional chemical properties that they have with these certain kind of double bonds, which I won't go into now but that makes them more valuable - that makes the 3s more valuable than the 6s, even though they'll both be liquids at pretty much the same temperature.  PALCA: Okay, that's good. Let's take one more call now, from Andy in Utah. Andy, welcome to the program.  ANDY (Caller): Hello.  PALCA: Hello.  ANDY: I was just wondering, I did take flax seed, and I put it in yogurt, and then take a flax seed oil pill. Am I doing myself any good?  Ms. ALLPORT: You're doing yourself great. You could also, you know - I don't know what kinds of oils you cook with, but if you reduce the amount of really high omega-6 oils, you'll give those omega-3s a better chance of getting into your tissues.  ANDY: Okay, so if I take a flax oil pill that's manufactured and then I take raw flax seed and put it in my yogurt. So which would be the best, or - Ms. ALLPORT: Oh, any of those. You know, I mean, you can get these omega-3s from a variety of means. Flax seed is great, but as I said you should also pay attention to what oil you're using in the cooking, and if it's safflower, sunflower, those really high omega-6 oils, they'll swamp those omega-3s in that flax-seed pill, if you're using that, so yeah.  ANDY: We cook in mostly olive oil.  PALCA: Yeah.  Ms. ALLPORT: Olive oil is good, Canola oil. Yup, those are good oils to cook with.  PALCA: Hey, Suzie you know what - and thanks, Andy. You know what? I was wondering. This whole - a lot of kids, when they were - well not kids, but people closer to my age, probably, who when they were young were forced to eat cod liver oil - is that, I mean, is that thought to be good? That was supposed to be high in omega-3.  Ms. ALLPORT: Yeah, it's very high in omega-3s, and it's interesting, though, because a lot of that oil that we were given tasted awful and it tasted awful because it was oxidized, and oxidized oils aren't good for you whether they're high in omega-3s or not, so it may have been of some benefit if it was fresh and your mother thought to keep it in the refrigerator. But if she didn't, it probably didn't help us too much. But yes, that's a really interesting phenomenon.  PALCA: We're talking with Suzie Allport, or Susan Allport, the author of The Queen of Fats: Why Omega-3s Were Removed from the Western Diet and What We Can Do to Replace Them. I'm Joe Palca and you're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.  And I want to get to the other part of the title of your book. Why were Omega-3s removed from the Western diet? What was that? Was it all just convenience because they wanted to keep things on shelves longer and they couldn't use these oils that became rancid faster?  Ms. ALLPORT: Right. I mean, that's where they connect with this trans story is because when those oils - you know, the omega-3s are in seeds in varying degrees, and there they really present a problem for the food producers because they are the things that are the most readily oxidized. So they came up - first of all, they totally hydrogenated these oils. That began at the beginning of the 20th century, and they eliminated any of the polyunsaturates, and then they decided that no, that they would just eliminate the omega-3s and leave the omega-6s because by that time, they knew that omega-6s were essential for health. They didn't know that the 3s were essential for health.  So then they came up on that technique of partial hydrogenation, and that created more 6s and trans, removed the 3s. Well, it's very hard to distinguish which is causing the problems, the 6s or the trans. But then they were also -the title says they were removed, but in reality they've been swamped by the amount of 6s in our diet. That has really soared over the past 100 years or so from seven grams a day per person to about 16 or 20 grams per person a day, and that's what the biggest change has been.  Trans has gone up since the \u201840s and \u201850s, and the spike has been parallel, but it's at a much lower level.  PALCA: Okay. I think we have time for one more call, so let's go to Catherine in Oxford, Mississippi. Catherine, welcome to the program.  CATHERINE (Caller): Thank you for having me.  PALCA: Sure.  CATHERINE: Actually, what I want to ask is being a vegetarian who doesn't eat anything with eyes or antennae, including fish, what's the best way I can get some omega-3s without taking supplements. And I'll take my call off the air. Thank you.  PALCA: Okay, thanks, Catherine.  Ms. ALLPORT: Well, you can always add flax seed to your breads, and you can use Canola oil for your baking, because Canola happens to have a really good ratio of the two fats. And another great way is to eat the omega-3 enriched eggs, and these are eggs from chickens that have been given a diet that is rich in omega-3s, it could be either flax seed or it could be algae or it could be fishmeal, and the chickens put those omega-3s into their eggs for the same reason that they're in the breast milk of women. It's to provide for the brain development in the next generation. In the case of chickens, it's the chicks. In the case of women, it's the child. But they're there for that reason, and it's a really good way to get those.  An egg from a chicken that is a free ranging chicken that's out there just foraging on its own, eating as many worms as it wants and picking up all the greens that it wants, will have as many omega-3s in it as a piece of fish, which is an astonishing thing. So by changing that part of our food supply, changing the eggs and the nutrient content of those eggs, we've really made a very major change.  PALCA: Okay, very briefly, very briefly - Ms. ALLPORT: Yeah, okay.  PALCA: Have you changed your diet?  Ms. ALLPORT: I have changed my diet. I have changed my diet, and I've even had my blood tested from some of these companies that have given me free tests. And after three or four years of changing my diet, I'm about at the level of a Mediterranean or Greek. I'm not down to where the Japanese are, who eat even more fish.  PALCA: I see. Well, all right. I guess some day I'll have to come and have dinner with you, and you can tell me what the right thing to do is.  Ms. ALLPORT: Oh please do, please do.  PALCA: Anyway, Suzie Allport, thanks very much for joining me today.  Ms. ALLPORT: Thank you, thank you.  PALCA: Susan Allport is a science writer.

You're standing around the water cooler and one of your co-workers says, You know what I heard?  Or your mom calls, or maybe she e-mails you. That's the new way to have your mothers watch over you and to tell you something that's dangerous that she's heard from one of her friends. It's how rumors get started. But is there any rhyme or reason to how rumors are transmitted or what makes for a good rumor and why some rumors spread like wildfire and others never make it out of a small group of people? Well, there may be answers to these questions, and joining me now are two guests who can help provide them. First, Nicholas DiFonzo is the co-author of the new academic book Rumor Psychology: Social and Organizational Approaches, just out from the American Psychological Association. He's a professor of psychology at the Rochester Institute of Technology in Rochester, New York. And he joins me from the studios of member station WXXI in Rochester. Welcome. Professor NICHOLAS DIFONZO (Rochester Institute of Technology): Hi, Joe. Glad to be here.  PALCA: And also with us this hour is Duncan Watts. He's the author of Six Degrees: The Science of a Connected Age, first published in 2003. He's a professor in the Department of Sociology and the Institute for Social and Economic Research and Policy at Columbia University in New York. And he joins us from our New York studios in New York. Welcome back to SCIENCE FRIDAY, Dr. Watts. Professor DUNCAN WATTS (Columbia University): Hi, Joe. PALCA: And we'll be taking your calls, so ask us your questions or maybe tell us your rumors: 1-800-989-8255. 1-800-989-TALK. And I'm afraid we're going to have to go to a break in just a few - a minute or so, but I thought we could at least get started here with a question for you, Dr. DiFonzo. What is the difference between, let's say, rumor and gossip or rumor and urban legend? Prof. DIFONZO: Well, rumor is unverified information and circulation among a group of people who are usually trying to make sense of an unclear situation or circumstance or they're trying to manage a threat or a potential threat. So the classic example of a rumor would be, hey, I heard that NPR was downsizing, Joe. What did you hear? PALCA: Uh-oh. Prof. DIFONZO: So people would, in this situation. . . PALCA: I heard that too. Prof. DIFONZO: I hope it's not true. The people in this situation are trying to figure out the facts. They're trying to make sense of the situation so that they can diminish a threat or potential threat that's coming their way. Whereas gossip has much more to do with social chat - social talk - that is ostensibly less important or less outcome-relevant that rumor is, and it's all about connections. So if I share with you gossip - did you hear what Duncan did at the party the other night. . . PALCA: Well, we're going to have to hear the end of that juicy tidbit after we come back from a break, so stay with us. I'm sorry. We will be back in just a short while talking about rumor and gossip and all that good stuff. (Soundbite of music) PALCA: From NPR News this is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Joe Palca. We're talking about rumors, gossip and urban legend, and who doesn't like talking about rumors, anyway? My guests are Duncan Watts. He's a professor of sociology at Columbia University at New York, and Nicholas DiFonzo, professor of psychology at the Rochester Institute of Technology in Rochester, New York. And we'd like to hear from you. Our number is 800-989-8255. That's 800-989-TALK. And the rumor that we're changing that number is completely untrue. It will be the correct number for the entire hour. And just before we left on a break we were talking with Dr. DiFonzo about the difference between rumor and gossip. And rumor is something that may be threatening that you may or may not want to do something about, but gossip is a little different, and maybe you could finish that explanation. Prof. DIFONZO: Sure. Gossip is all about social chat. When I share gossip with you, you're my friend. I feel closer to you and you feel closer to me, so there's a bonding function that goes on. And I could also be talking about things that the group ought to be doing or ought not to be doing. So if I talk about Duncan's escapades at the party last Friday night, I could be criticizing him for doing that, and by the same token, talking about what people should not be doing at the party, or if I'm lauding him, what they should be doing at such occasions. So gossip is very social in nature. It's all about the personal social networks that one finds one a part of. Urban legend is a narrative story. It has a plot, a setting, a climax, usually a denouement, and almost always a moral to the story. So they're usually intricate stories about modern themes such as hitchhikers and automobiles - those sorts of things. They're entertaining. There's some bonding that goes on as well, but they usually make sense of the world in a broader context. That is, they help us figure out the world and they have a moral to them much like the old fables did. PALCA: Hmm. Let me turn to you, Duncan Watts, and ask the question - it's always struck me that it sometimes feels that there's one person somewhere in the world who's generating all these things, and if you could just figure out who that person was and tell them to stop, it wouldn't happen anymore. But I guess it couldn't be that way. But is it ever possible to say that rumor started with him or her? Prof. WATTS: In any particular instance, it's obviously, you know - everything starts somewhere. You know, if you make the analogy with epidemics of infectious disease, you know, even sort of global pandemics like the 1919 Spanish flu, you know, almost certainly started with a single person somewhere, probably, you know, in Southern China. And the same thing is going to be true of rumors, whether they spread just very narrowly within a single group or spread very widely. The point to make, though, is that there needn't be anything particularly special about the person who starts the rumor, and so this is sort of a bit counterintuitive, because when something special happens - you know, when some, you know, amazing rumor starts sort of sweeping across a city or a country or even throughout an organization, you might think that the person who began it had to be special as well. But that actually turns out not to be the case necessarily.  You know, it has - you know, whether - why some things spread and other things don't, you know, is partly, you know, due to the kind of psychological affects that Nicholas is talking about. You know, some things just so to satisfy our emotional needs than others, and that's certainly relevant. But there's also a structural side to the problem as well, and this is sort of more where the social networks become relevant, is that people are not, you know, uniformly spread across, you know, geography or through cities or through organizations. They are clumped together. They are connected non-randomly in all sorts of sort of complicated and overlapping networks, and the structure of the groups and the organizations and the way that they're connected to each other can have, you know, enormous impact on what spreads and what doesn't, and that's really not something that you can pin on any particular individual. PALCA: Okay. Well, let's invite our listeners to join in this conversation. Our number is 800-989-8255. And let's first go to Ian in San Diego, California. Ian, welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY. IAN (Caller): Hi, thanks for taking my call. This is a great program. I'd like to propose that social - that viral marketing is sort of a reinvention of the rumor for profitable purposes, specifically in the online world, but I'd like to hear your guests' comments on it. PALCA: Okay. Well, Dr. DiFonzo, are you familiar with the concept of viral marketing, first of all? Prof. DIFONZO: Sure, viral marketing. It uses the epidemic kind of metaphor or analogy that a rumor spreads by word of mouth through these different networks that Duncan and others are studying. And it's cheap. I don't have to pay for airtime in order for things to spread far and wide, and it's often very effective. Who's the best person to persuade me but somebody that I know, somebody in my personal social network, that Product A or Product B is good? PALCA: But how does the virus, in this case, or the rumor, get injected into the system?  I mean, where does that germ come from?  Go ahead, Dr. Watts. Prof. WATTS: Well, you know, this is sort of - there's a bunch of different strategies, of course. You know, you can  - you can start with some sort of online campaign and you can try to get people talking about some mysterious video or some sort of funny website and give them tools so that they can easily forward URLs or e-mails to their friends, for example, and that's how, you know, some of these viral campaigns get seeded. Other times you can, you know, you can hand out free merchandise at parties or at bars or, you know, leave them with random people in their mailboxes. The problem is that nobody knows yet how to sort of engineer - to make use of these - these, you know - clearly in some sense these word-of-mouth ties are very useful and people trust them and pay attention to them in ways that they don't pay attention to traditional media. The downside is that it gets very complicated and it's hard to sort of engineer these networks to do the things that you want them to do. PALCA: All right. Ian, thanks very much for that question. Why don't we go now to Marcus. I'm sorry, Marcus in Virginia. Welcome to the program. MARCUS (Caller): Hi. I'm working for an Internet company and we've got layoffs pending, and the only source of information that we really have is rumors, and they tend to be a lot more reliable than official channels, and I'm just wondering if you had any comments on rumors - you know, the growth of rumors when either official channels aren't reliable or there just isn't much information. PALCA: Yeah, Dr. DiFonzo, what about that?  Do rumors ever - you know, I mean, is there usually a grain of truth somewhere, or is that not always the case? Prof. DIFONZO: Marcus is in a very common situation, in which rumors flourish when there's a lack of formal information. The best way to get rumors going in an organization is to not saying anything or not say very much or to say contradictory things. And so it's not surprising that the rumors are spreading very quickly in that organization.  The other thing to say is that the most interesting question to me about rumors is, how do you know that what you know is true? That is, how do you know that this rumor is either accurate or not accurate? And it turns out that there's some situations in which they are very accurate, and there's other situation which they're not very accurate. And looking at a collection of communications studies that were done in the '70s, '80s, where communication researchers went into organizations such as the one Marcus is in and they collected rumors and they calculated the percentage of rumors that were accurate. Turns out that in organizations where there's an established grapevine, the rumors are usually 95 or more percent correct. And so, Marcus, you're doing well. I would bet money on some of those rumors that you're hearing, especially if the network that you're in is an active one and the people are interested in figuring out the facts rather than fulfilling some kind of prejudice or bias, and if they're - and if it's an established grapevine that's been around for a while. So if I hear something from my co-worker, I've known him for a while and I can judge his credibility.   PALCA: Okay. . . MARCUS: I. . . PALCA: Go ahead. Marcus, go ahead. MARCUS: Generally what I try and do is just crosscheck everything.  PALCA: Yeah.  MARCUS: What I hear from one person I try and see if I hear it from others. PALCA: Yeah, yeah. Well, that's, you know - I mean that's - everybody's singing from the same book, but it might be from the wrong one, you know? MARCUS: That's happened too. PALCA: Marcus, thanks very much for the call. You know, not very long ago, just speaking of social networks and people liking to check things, there was a rumor flying around NPR that we were about to have a shakeup in senior management. And you know, this is a group of reporters here. So they're sort of used to tracking things down. And sure enough, the next morning the shakeup was announced. So somebody knew something and it was accurate. A funny position to be in, though, when it's in your own newsroom. All right. Well, let's take another call now. Rebecca in Des Moines, Iowa. Welcome to the program. REBECCA (Caller): Hi. PALCA: Hi. REBECCA: I don't know if it's an urban legend or a rumor - certainly it's in the political arena - but the biggest rumor that I've heard, or urban legend that I've heard, is that Al Gore claimed to have invented the Internet. He never said that he invented the Internet, but the more the story got told, the more people believed that it was true or believed that it was fact, and it was never the case. So I don't know, I guess I would like your comment on that particular urban myth or rumor. PALCA: Okay. Thank you for the question, Rebecca. What about - Duncan Watts, first of all, how would you characterize that, urban legend or rumor? Prof. WATTS: Well, I guess I am sort of - I guess I don't have the same taxonomy of how things spread. I tend to sort of, you know, think about these problems from something of a social learning perspective that, you know, basically the world is very complicated and it's impossible for all of us to go out and gather all the information that we need on a daily basis. And so it makes perfect sense to try and infer information from other people. So we have some sort sensible heuristics for saying, well, you know, if I hear something once, then that increases the likelihood that I'll believe it. And if I hear it twice or three times then, you know, that likelihood increases in some possibly sort of non-linear kind of way. And so, you know, one of the important and possibly the most important property of a rumor is whether you believe it and transmit it the first time you hear it or whether you have to hear it twice. And just that one step makes an enormous difference in how far things spread and how fast they spread. So possibly in the Al Gore case, you know, it's not true, but it's sort of, you know, it's kind of easy to believe and it's sort of fun to talk about. So you have a relatively low threshold for accepting it as the truth. And those are the things that tend to get around very widely. PALCA: Dr. DiFonzo, I'm just wondering if there's any way to predict in advance how people try to inject in rumors and then make some sort of calculation about whether they're going to spread or not. Prof. DIFONZO: There were several studies some time ago where researchers would go into an organization or they'd go into a group and they would inject a false rumor, usually pretty innocuous. And then they would wait a few days and then pass out questionnaires to everybody in the organization and say have you heard this rumor and where did you hear it from, and they'd trace it back to the person who spread the rumor. Now, the Al Gore rumor is - we could kind of classify that also as an urban legend. There is some overlap sometime. But I think the interesting thing about that rumor is that - it is that Al Gore said he invented the Internet. And if you think about it, the motivation for spreading that kind of rumor is to kind of make fun of Al Gore. So obviously the people who would be most likely to spread that rumor would at least be in part motivated by a negative disposition toward Al Gore and that sort of thing. PALCA: Got it. Prof. WATTS: That's my take on that rumor for Rebecca. PALCA: Okay. All right. Well, thank you for that. And we're talking about rumors, gossip, urban legends, how they spread. I'm Joe Palca and this TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. And let's take another call now. And let's go to, oh, why don't we say Bob in Wilmington, Delaware. Welcome to the program. BOB (Caller): Thank you very much. I take a lot of pleasure in debunking urban myths, especially at work, like using the Snopes Web site. But there's one thing I never quite understood. Prior to the Internet, back in the - especially  back in '80s, I've never quite understood how urban legends could spread so quickly back then, you know, in sort of a pre-technological age. I'm thinking of one story in particular I've heard. I don't want to go into great detail. But it's a local Philadelphia TV personality, something sexual about this person that spread incredibly rapidly. And anybody I know who grew up in that area knows this story. And it seems like overnight everybody knew this particular story about this guy. PALCA: They're raising their hands in the control room here saying we know that story. I don't know the story. But yes, please don't go into any details here. . . BOB: I'm not going to. How did that, pre-Internet, how did something like that circulate? PALCA: I know. It's hard to believe we did anything pre-Internet. But okay, let's go to Duncan Watts. Maybe he can help us out a little bit here. Prof. WATTS: So I think there actually is a good reason for that. And it goes back to this sort of well-known idea of the small world problem that social networks have a certain structure to them such that, you know, everybody is connected in a sense by only a few degrees of separation. So you know someone who knows someone who knows someone who knows anyone in the world. And that is, you know, an idea that's been around for a long time. But I think that recently we've gotten to understand it very well. And one of the things that we've understood about it is that this small world probably happened quite a long time go. And so, you know, and once the, and the reason is that you don't require a lot of fancy technology for social networks to develop this kind of property. And the second thing is that once the world gets small, it's much harder to make it smaller, right? So in some sense, yes, the world is getting smaller and these rumors probably are spreading a little bit faster as a result of the Internet and e-mail and so on. However, they were already spreading very fast. And so you don't get a, you know, you're sort of incurring diminishing returns at this point. PALCA: Okay. Bob, thanks very much for that question. Dr. DiFonzo, we only have about 30 seconds left. But I wonder if I can ask you briefly, is there any way, once a rumor gets started, to stop it? Prof. DIFONZO: Well, there is some good techniques that one can use if you're in that position where you want to stop the rumor. First of all, I'd urge you to stop the rumor only if it's not true. You wouldn't want to deny a rumor or rebut a rumor if in fact it is true. Don't use the approach no comment, or rather almost never use the approach no comment, because it increases a level of uncertainty: why is this person saying no comment? One of the best techniques is to rebut the rumor, but to use a third party, a trusted third party to do the rebutting. And then when you rebut the rumor, to provide a context. PALCA: Well, we'll have to leave it there, I'm afraid. Thank you very much both of you. Dr. Nicholas DiFonzo is a professor of psychology at Rochester Institute of Technology, and Duncan Watts is the author of Six Degrees: The Science of a Connected Age.  JOE PALCA, host:   All right. You're standing around the water cooler and one of your co-workers says, You know what I heard?  Or your mom calls, or maybe she e-mails you. That's the new way to have your mothers watch over you and to tell you something that's dangerous that she's heard from one of her friends. It's how rumors get started. But is there any rhyme or reason to how rumors are transmitted or what makes for a good rumor and why some rumors spread like wildfire and others never make it out of a small group of people?

He's a professor in the Department of Sociology and the Institute for Social and Economic Research and Policy at Columbia University in New York. And he joins us from our New York studios in New York. Welcome back to SCIENCE FRIDAY, Dr. Watts.  Professor DUNCAN WATTS (Columbia University): Hi, Joe.  PALCA: And we'll be taking your calls, so ask us your questions or maybe tell us your rumors: 1-800-989-8255. 1-800-989-TALK. And I'm afraid we're going to have to go to a break in just a few - a minute or so, but I thought we could at least get started here with a question for you, Dr. DiFonzo.

And we'd like to hear from you. Our number is 800-989-8255. That's 800-989-TALK. And the rumor that we're changing that number is completely untrue. It will be the correct number for the entire hour. And just before we left on a break we were talking with Dr. DiFonzo about the difference between rumor and gossip. And rumor is something that may be threatening that you may or may not want to do something about, but gossip is a little different, and maybe you could finish that explanation.  Prof. DIFONZO: Sure.

The downside is that it gets very complicated and it's hard to sort of engineer these networks to do the things that you want them to do.  PALCA: All right. Ian, thanks very much for that question. Why don't we go now to Marcus. I'm sorry, Marcus in Virginia. Welcome to the program.  MARCUS (Caller): Hi. I'm working for an Internet company and we've got layoffs pending, and the only source of information that we really have is rumors, and they tend to be a lot more reliable than official channels, and I'm just wondering if you had any comments on rumors - you know, the growth of rumors when either official channels aren't reliable or there just isn't much information.  PALCA: Yeah, Dr. DiFonzo, what about that?  Do rumors ever - you know, I mean, is there usually a grain of truth somewhere, or is that not always the case?  Prof. DIFONZO: Marcus is in a very common situation, in which rumors flourish when there's a lack of formal information. The best way to get rumors going in an organization is to not saying anything or not say very much or to say contradictory things. And so it's not surprising that the rumors are spreading very quickly in that organization.   The other thing to say is that the most interesting question to me about rumors is, how do you know that what you know is true? That is, how do you know that this rumor is either accurate or not accurate? And it turns out that there's some situations in which they are very accurate, and there's other situation which they're not very accurate. And looking at a collection of communications studies that were done in the '70s, '80s, where communication researchers went into organizations such as the one Marcus is in and they collected rumors and they calculated the percentage of rumors that were accurate.  Turns out that in organizations where there's an established grapevine, the rumors are usually 95 or more percent correct. And so, Marcus, you're doing well. I would bet money on some of those rumors that you're hearing, especially if the network that you're in is an active one and the people are interested in figuring out the facts rather than fulfilling some kind of prejudice or bias, and if they're - and if it's an established grapevine that's been around for a while.  So if I hear something from my co-worker, I've known him for a while and I can judge his credibility.    PALCA: Okay. . .  MARCUS: I. . .  PALCA: Go ahead. Marcus, go ahead.  MARCUS: Generally what I try and do is just crosscheck everything.   PALCA: Yeah.   MARCUS: What I hear from one person I try and see if I hear it from others.  PALCA: Yeah, yeah. Well, that's, you know - I mean that's - everybody's singing from the same book, but it might be from the wrong one, you know?  MARCUS: That's happened too.  PALCA: Marcus, thanks very much for the call. You know, not very long ago, just speaking of social networks and people liking to check things, there was a rumor flying around NPR that we were about to have a shakeup in senior management. And you know, this is a group of reporters here. So they're sort of used to tracking things down. And sure enough, the next morning the shakeup was announced. So somebody knew something and it was accurate. A funny position to be in, though, when it's in your own newsroom.  All right. Well, let's take another call now. Rebecca in Des Moines, Iowa. Welcome to the program.  REBECCA (Caller): Hi.  PALCA: Hi.  REBECCA: I don't know if it's an urban legend or a rumor - certainly it's in the political arena - but the biggest rumor that I've heard, or urban legend that I've heard, is that Al Gore claimed to have invented the Internet. He never said that he invented the Internet, but the more the story got told, the more people believed that it was true or believed that it was fact, and it was never the case.  So I don't know, I guess I would like your comment on that particular urban myth or rumor.  PALCA: Okay. Thank you for the question, Rebecca. What about - Duncan Watts, first of all, how would you characterize that, urban legend or rumor?  Prof. WATTS: Well, I guess I am sort of - I guess I don't have the same taxonomy of how things spread. I tend to sort of, you know, think about these problems from something of a social learning perspective that, you know, basically the world is very complicated and it's impossible for all of us to go out and gather all the information that we need on a daily basis.  And so it makes perfect sense to try and infer information from other people. So we have some sort sensible heuristics for saying, well, you know, if I hear something once, then that increases the likelihood that I'll believe it. And if I hear it twice or three times then, you know, that likelihood increases in some possibly sort of non-linear kind of way.  And so, you know, one of the important and possibly the most important property of a rumor is whether you believe it and transmit it the first time you hear it or whether you have to hear it twice. And just that one step makes an enormous difference in how far things spread and how fast they spread.  So possibly in the Al Gore case, you know, it's not true, but it's sort of, you know, it's kind of easy to believe and it's sort of fun to talk about. So you have a relatively low threshold for accepting it as the truth. And those are the things that tend to get around very widely.  PALCA: Dr. DiFonzo, I'm just wondering if there's any way to predict in advance how people try to inject in rumors and then make some sort of calculation about whether they're going to spread or not.  Prof. DIFONZO: There were several studies some time ago where researchers would go into an organization or they'd go into a group and they would inject a false rumor, usually pretty innocuous. And then they would wait a few days and then pass out questionnaires to everybody in the organization and say have you heard this rumor and where did you hear it from, and they'd trace it back to the person who spread the rumor.  Now, the Al Gore rumor is - we could kind of classify that also as an urban legend. There is some overlap sometime. But I think the interesting thing about that rumor is that - it is that Al Gore said he invented the Internet. And if you think about it, the motivation for spreading that kind of rumor is to kind of make fun of Al Gore. So obviously the people who would be most likely to spread that rumor would at least be in part motivated by a negative disposition toward Al Gore and that sort of thing.  PALCA: Got it.  Prof. WATTS: That's my take on that rumor for Rebecca.  PALCA: Okay. All right. Well, thank you for that. And we're talking about rumors, gossip, urban legends, how they spread. I'm Joe Palca and this TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.  And let's take another call now. And let's go to, oh, why don't we say Bob in Wilmington, Delaware. Welcome to the program.  BOB (Caller): Thank you very much. I take a lot of pleasure in debunking urban myths, especially at work, like using the Snopes Web site. But there's one thing I never quite understood. Prior to the Internet, back in the - especially  back in '80s, I've never quite understood how urban legends could spread so quickly back then, you know, in sort of a pre-technological age. I'm thinking of one story in particular I've heard. I don't want to go into great detail. But it's a local Philadelphia TV personality, something sexual about this person that spread incredibly rapidly. And anybody I know who grew up in that area knows this story. And it seems like overnight everybody knew this particular story about this guy.  PALCA: They're raising their hands in the control room here saying we know that story. I don't know the story. But yes, please don't go into any details here. . .  BOB: I'm not going to. How did that, pre-Internet, how did something like that circulate?  PALCA: I know. It's hard to believe we did anything pre-Internet. But okay, let's go to Duncan Watts. Maybe he can help us out a little bit here.  Prof. WATTS: So I think there actually is a good reason for that. And it goes back to this sort of well-known idea of the small world problem that social networks have a certain structure to them such that, you know, everybody is connected in a sense by only a few degrees of separation. So you know someone who knows someone who knows someone who knows anyone in the world. And that is, you know, an idea that's been around for a long time.  But I think that recently we've gotten to understand it very well. And one of the things that we've understood about it is that this small world probably happened quite a long time go. And so, you know, and once the, and the reason is that you don't require a lot of fancy technology for social networks to develop this kind of property.  And the second thing is that once the world gets small, it's much harder to make it smaller, right? So in some sense, yes, the world is getting smaller and these rumors probably are spreading a little bit faster as a result of the Internet and e-mail and so on.  However, they were already spreading very fast. And so you don't get a, you know, you're sort of incurring diminishing returns at this point.  PALCA: Okay. Bob, thanks very much for that question. Dr. DiFonzo, we only have about 30 seconds left. But I wonder if I can ask you briefly, is there any way, once a rumor gets started, to stop it?  Prof. DIFONZO: Well, there is some good techniques that one can use if you're in that position where you want to stop the rumor. First of all, I'd urge you to stop the rumor only if it's not true. You wouldn't want to deny a rumor or rebut a rumor if in fact it is true. Don't use the approach no comment, or rather almost never use the approach no comment, because it increases a level of uncertainty: why is this person saying no comment?  One of the best techniques is to rebut the rumor, but to use a third party, a trusted third party to do the rebutting. And then when you rebut the rumor, to provide a context.  PALCA: Well, we'll have to leave it there, I'm afraid. Thank you very much both of you.

I'm Michele Norris. MELISSA BLOCK, host: And I'm Melissa Block. A provocative branch of physics called string theory might explain everything in the universe - how matter came into being and why space and time exist. Or the theory might explain nothing. For more than 30 years, it has captivated some of the best minds in physics. NPR's Richard Harris reports on an intellectual feud that has spilled out of the towers of academe and onto the soccer field. RICHARD HARRIS: Imagine if you spent your days pondering a universe that has nine or 10 dimensions of space - not just three - or if you spent your time trying to understand how our universe could be one of a jillion. Well, it must feel pretty good to get out on a soccer field and kick around a true to life three dimensional ball. (Soundbite of whistle) Dr. ROBERT KIRSHNER (Harvard University): All right. Where is the captain of the string team? HARRIS: Twice a year, string theorists visiting UC Santa Barbara take on their colleagues in a friendly game of soccer. They have never lost a game. It has become a point of pride, especially now. Off the field, string theory is under attack. Dr. KIRSHNER: These are the string theorists. Two, four, six, eight - that's close enough to 11, the way they count. HARRIS: Astronomer Robert Kirshner, on sabbatical from Harvard, agreed to referee the most recent game. It takes place on a strip of grass between the beach and the barbecue pit. Dr. KIRSHNER: The rules of the field are rather complicated and I'm making them up as I go along. The ball touches the lifeguard stand, it is out of bounds. The trees are in play. Try not to hurt them. They will be some of your best defenders. HARRIS: For this match, string theorists here for a conference are taking on another group of visitors - high power laser physicists. One of the players is Albion Lawrence from Brandeis University. He may not be a soccer star, but he does have a passion for string theory. He says the idea was really born in the late 1960s. That's when a physicist wrote down a mathematical formula that described one subatomic particle. Physicists puzzled over this formula for a while, and then came to realize that it was not only describing a particle, it was describing vibrating strings, like the ones on the guitar on Albion Lawrence's lap. Dr. ALBION LAWRENCE (Brandeis University) Among other things, the higher the frequency that the string vibrates, the more mass of the particle. HARRIS: So could you play me a particle? Dr. LAWRENCE: Yeah, this could be a particle. (Soundbite of guitar) Dr. LAWRENCE: Essentially, it would be like all the particles of different masses. HARRIS: So if I were to write a mathematical formula that described what you were doing with the guitar string, would it end up looking somewhat like a string theory formula? Dr. LAWRENCE: Roughly speaking, if you don't pluck the guitar string too hard, it would look similar. HARRIS: The theory had immediate appeal. How tidy to think that all the fundamental particles, like quarks and gluons and leptons, were actually the same string, just vibrating differently. And all the forces of nature were just variations on this string theory. Of course, there are a few odd problems with this. For example, string theory math suggests that there are nine or 10 dimensions of space, not just the three we perceive. (Soundbite of cheering) HARRIS: Back on the soccer field, the opposing team quickly scores a goal. The string theorists are stunned. They've never even been behind in the nine year history of this game. And these days, the theorists are not only being challenged on the soccer pitch. In the past year, critics have written three books attacking the basic premise of string theory. Lawrence Krauss at Case Western Reserve University wrote one of them. Dr. LAWRENCE KRAUSS (Case Western Reserve University): I kind of think of string theory as being like a promising young assistant professor, you know, who looks really smart. But we usually don't give them 30 years to produce something. HARRIS: Sure, he says, their ideas are provocative. The problem is they are all unproven, and may be untestable with the current technology. By some reckoning, you'd need an atom smasher the size of the galaxy to see strings directly. Dr. KRAUSS: As I like to say, there's at this point as much experimental evidence that quarks are made up of little pink elephants as they are of strings. So I think that it behooves us to be honest and not claim for our theories more than we produce, because ultimately that's going to come back and bite us. HARRIS: And string theory has grown vastly more complicated over the past few decades. Every time a new problem arises, string theorists weave astonishing new and complicated explanations to get around them. For example, the theorists get around one problem by saying there are more universes out there than there are atoms in our universe. Krauss says it's hard to know whether to be amazed that we live in such a bizarre place or worried that theorists have lost their way. Dr. KRAUSS: To the extent that we even understand string theory, it may imply a massive number of possible different universes with different laws of physics in each universe and there may be no way of distinguishing between them or saying why the laws of physics are the way they are. And if I can predict anything, then I haven't explained anything. If I have a theory of everything, then in some sense, I have a theory of nothing. HARRIS: And on the field, the string theorists are still out of sync. Dr. KIRSHNER: Okay. That's the first half. (Soundbite of whistle) Dr. KIRSHNER: The score is what? HARRIS: At the half, the score is two to one, with the string team losing and looking none too happy about it. Referee Bob Kirshner comes to the sidelines for a beer. Dr. KIRSHNER: There was actually a brief moment where someone was playing with skill, and I blew the whistle immediately to stop the game, because that was way overboard. HARRIS: David Gross, the director of the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics and the picnic's benefactor, is concerned that the game will end before the meat is off the grill. Dr. DAVID GROSS (Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics): We've got to keep going until 5:00. Dr. KIRSHNER: I know that. We'll give them 10 minutes. And then we'll play. You know how it is. It's not only the time on the clock, there's the out of bounds time, there's the injury time, there's the relativistic correction. HARRIS: The institute director occupies a curious place in the string theory debate. Gross won a Nobel Prize a few years ago for work in a conventional branch of theoretical physics. But now he's a strong proponent of string theory. Dr. GROSS: Even those of us who work in the field aren't really sure what string theory is or what it's going to be. So when you're in this kind of speculative, exploratory science, it's important to have faith, because you're out on a big limb. So I think it's really a question of whether we believe this is the right direction. And that I do believe rather firmly. HARRIS: Gross has heard all the criticisms of string theory and he has ready rebuttals. Dr. GROSS: One is rather flippant but correct, and it's that there's nothing else. There's no other game in town. HARRIS: Nothing else, in his view, really provides a way to think about the biggest and most interesting problems in physics. Dr. KIRSHNER: Okay. Quarter kick. Now stay away from that garbage. HARRIS: Back on the soccer field, things are still looking grim for string theorists. Santa Barbara scientist Steve Giddings is pacing on the sidelines. Dr. KIRSHNER: Getting nervous, Steve? Dr. STEVE GIDDINGS (University of California Santa Barbara): We'll give them some more time. We'll start using the extra dimensions to catch up. HARRIS: Okay, so string theory jokes tend toward the obscure. Giddings is actually feeling somewhat more optimistic about the fate of string theory these days. That's because in a year or two, a powerful new atom smasher will open up near Geneva, Switzerland. And there is at least a remote chance that the accelerator can finally provide some real evidence for string theory. Dr. GIDDINGS: The best we'll probably do is get some indirect hints for what string theory is all about. But then there's always this jackpot scenario where we could actually start seeing direct evidence. HARRIS: Giddings says if the strings turn out to be relatively large, particle collisions in this accelerator could start to pluck the string of gravity, if you will. And if the scientists are extraordinarily lucky, Giddings says black holes could form and then quickly evaporate. Dr. GIDDINGS: So it's not something that we would worry about in the context of, say, planet Earth, but we would really see these as very unusual looking events in the particle detectors there. HARRIS: And string theory would not only be vindicated, but great excitement would ensue. Even most string theorists say this is a real long shot. Now the question is whether they can even hit the jackpot on more comfortable turf: the soccer field. With moments left, the game is tied at two. HARRIS: Suddenly, string theorists get a huge break. One of the guys on the opposing team thinks play has stopped, so he picks up the ball. String theorists get a penalty kick. They score, keeping intact their perfect record - on the soccer field, at least. (Soundbite of whistle) HARRIS: Kavli Institute director David Gross looks on approvingly from the sidelines. Dr. GROSS: Proves string theory is right. HARRIS: So that's what it takes, huh? Dr. GROSS: We have experimental confirmation. HARRIS: And he'll take the win any way he can get it. Richard Harris, NPR News. Dr. GROSS: The guy picked up the ball. What can I say? I'm pretty familiar with that, you know, at that level. Unidentified Man: Shall I pay you off now? Dr. GROSS: Not here, not now.  MICHELE NORRIS, host:  From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Michele Norris.  MELISSA BLOCK, host:  And I'm Melissa Block.

That's the test that raised alarms among North Korea's neighbors and drew international condemnation. RENEE MONTAGNE, host: The idea of more bombs worries the world's defense strategists. It's not only the threat from the new nuclear nations but the risk that terrorist will get a hold of bombs or the material to make them. So scientists are working on better ways to trace nuclear materials back to their source. NPR's Christopher Joyce has this story about the growing field of nuclear forensics. CHRISTOPHER JOYCE: Raymond Jeanloz is a geophysicist who thinks about the unthinkable: a nuclear attack on America. Besides the horrible casualties, he worries about how to find out who did it. Mr. RAYMOND JEANLOZ (Geophysicist, University of California Berkeley): There will be a huge pressure to understand what was involved. Was it a sophisticated military weapon? Was it an improvised terrorist device? Was it civilian nuclear power material? Where might it have come from? JOYCE: Jeanloz notes that after the deadly anthrax mailings in 2003, a search for the source failed in part because there are so many laboratories it could have come from. The same is true for the enriched uranium or plutonium to make bombs. Experts say some 40 countries possess these materials in weapons or in power or research reactors. All that material needs to be catalogued, says Jeanloz, a professor at the University of California at Berkeley. In a recent issue of the journal Nature, he and two former government scientists say such a catalogue could help investigators identify the source of bomb material. The catalogue would list the unique markers left on bomb material during the manufacturing process. JEANLOZ: In the case of plutonium, which is created in reactors, one learns a lot about the way the processing has been done, how long the material has been in the reactors and so on. JOYCE: Enriched uranium is made another way in huge and complicated centrifuges, but these too leave unique markers. Even the ore that uranium comes from has its own geological signature. As it happens, the Department of Homeland Security is beginning to put together its own nuclear database. Vayl Oxford, head of the department's Domestic Nuclear Detection Office, says there are lots of markers to choose from. Mr. VAYL OXFORD (Director, Domestic Nuclear Detection Office): It is the isotopes, it's the chemical composition, it's actual physical structure. We're essentially trying to come up with a DNA fingerprint for those kind of materials - although it's dramatically different - but to be able to have that kind of library to assess against when we actually get those kind of samples. JOYCE: Several other nuclear nations have their own small libraries, too. But what's being talked about now is a more comprehensive and global one. It could be useful right away. For example, in tracking down the source of bomb material seized on the black market. Since 1993, there have been 16 seizures. These nuclear yellow pages could also help trace the source of a dirty bomb if it uses enriched uranium or plutonium. In fact, Oxford says, Homeland Security is setting up procedures for teams to identify material after an actual nuclear blast. OXFORD: They would go into the debris field, collect the samples. They would very quickly then get that into one of the laboratories to begin the characterization of the material. Our addition to that would be to start to look at the library that already exists to see what the closest matches are. JOYCE: Nuclear scientists say tracing material after a nuclear explosion would be daunting but possible. Technology for identifying the elemental and chemical nature of materials has improved. Page Stoutland is chemist with the Nuclear Countermeasures Division at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, one of the government's weapons labs. Mr. PAGE STOUTLAND (Chemist, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory): Quite recently, within the last few years, instruments that come online that not only give you high sensitivity but we can also look at individual nanometer-sized particle using mass spectroscopy. That gives us a lot of - a totally new handle, if you will, on the forensics. JOYCE: Stoutland says, in fact, the instruments have improved faster than the ability to store and analyze the information they provide. Matthew Bunn, a nuclear expect at Harvard University's project on Managing the Atom, says countries such a North Korea or Iran are not likely to cooperate in putting together a database, but even a partial library would help narrow the suspects after an attack. Mr. MATTHEW BUNN (Senior Research Associate, Harvard University): You may, by process of elimination, say, well, it didn't come from any of the known sources in Russia. It didn't come from any of the known sources in France and so on and so on, and greatly increase your ability to focus in on the likely perpetrators. JOYCE: Bunn says a good nuclear database would also have other benefits right away. Since it would make it easier to track black market material to its original source, it might encourage governments to be more careful with their nuclear stockpiles. Nobody, he says, wants a reputation for being loose with its nukes. Christopher Joyce, NPR News.  STEVE INSKEEP, host:  Senior officials from the United States and South Korea met in Seoul today. They discussed the resumption of the six-party negotiations on North Korea's nuclear weapons program, which Pyongyang agreed to last week.  Also on the agenda was the enforcement of United Nations sanctions, which were approved shortly after North Korea conducted an underground nuclear test. That's the test that raised alarms among North Korea's neighbors and drew international condemnation.  RENEE MONTAGNE, host:  The idea of more bombs worries the world's defense strategists. It's not only the threat from the new nuclear nations but the risk that terrorist will get a hold of bombs or the material to make them.

A new survey from the country's leading mental health organization is out. Mental Health America has chronicled who is the most stressed, what they do to cope - mother's little helper anyone? - and what the consequences are for ignoring stress. Psychologist David Shern is the head of Mental Health America and he joins me now. Welcome to the program. Dr. DAVID SHERN (Head, Mental Health America): Hey Madeleine, it's great to be here, thanks for having us on. BRAND: Gee you know I would have thought it would have been Republicans - would be the most stressed-out group right now, but no actually it's parents. Dr. SHERN: Well and we did the survey just right before the election, so. BRAND: So why are they the most stressed-out group? Dr. SHERN: People in general report that finances or things that stress them; employment, and working around the home; and parents sort of have all of those things. They have the home to take care of; you know typically in the way we've got our culture structured now, they work more than one job. So it's all of those things that add up to the sort of the complex responsibilities and their complex lives. BRAND: And are different groups stressed-out by different things? Dr. SHERN: Well we find out, yeah, that they are. Persons who are from African American backgrounds and Native Americans have greater levels of stress than non-Hispanic whites. And so you know, these things are probably related to income, education - sort of social opportunities as well. And difficulty, I think, in terms of full participation in our society. They become markers for that. BRAND: Well what do you think people should do?  How should they cope with stress? Dr. SHERN: People who feel as though they live in an environment in which they have a reasonable amount of control - I mean nobody is completely in control of everything - but a reasonable amount of control are people who can actively cope with stress. It's individuals who feel as though they are out of control, in a way, things are happening to them, who are stressed. The image for me is somebody that starts grabbing you by the neck and dragging you along, that can then start to have some pretty serious consequences for your health. BRAND: Such as? Dr. SHERN: Depression is number one. Anxiety. We now have come to understand that when you're stressed, it actually raises the level of a hormone called Cortisol and that can start a cascade which can lead to anxiety disorders, depression, cardiac illness, hypertension - and so it's really very important. It's not just a matter of sort of feeling just a little sad or blue. But ultimately, it can have very serious consequences for your wellbeing. BRAND: You talked about this feeling of being out of control. And for a lot of people, their lives are made up of things that they can't totally control. I mean you've got a job you have to go to. Perhaps you're stuck in traffic on a long commute every single day. You come home and there are children to feed and spouses to take care of, and all sorts of things that really a lot of people can't change. So how do you advise most of us who have lots of things in our lives that stress us yet we can't really do much to change them. Dr. SHERN: The important thing is how you perceive the situation that you're in. Psychologically, if you work on essentially not allowing yourself to become anxious, for example, in traffic - just monitor how you're feeling, realize that there's very little you're going to do to influence how quickly the Fourteenth Street Bridge here in Washington is going to let you into the city, even though you're late for a Senate testimony. You realize -BRAND: Are you speaking personally? Dr. SHERN: You realize that - yeah, your inaugural opportunity to testify in the Senate, actually - and one thing that was very helpful there was having a cell phone to call and tell people so that they could start to change some things. So, it's how you\u2014it's the resources you have to bear, the people you have to rely on which are a resource, and also your skills in terms of the way you think about and understand things that are really outside of your control. BRAND: And let's not discount the after-five martini. Just one. Dr. SHERN: Absolutely. Well, that you know that's some of the great health news we've had recently is that you know moderate levels of alcohol consumption actually seem to be protective, and the recent findings around red wine have given us all great encouragement. BRAND: Psychologist David Shern is the president and CEO of Mental Health America. The group just released a study about stress. And thank you very much. Dr. SHERN: Thank you so much.

I'm Madeleine Brand. ALEX CHADWICK, host: I'm Alex Chadwick. Today the Food and Drug Administration is expected to extend approval for a highly effective anti-cancer drug. It's been show to help women with an aggressive form of breast cancer. NPR's Patricia Neighmond reports. PATRICIA NEIGHMOND: The drug called Herceptin is already approved for late stage breast cancer. It literally works its way into the cancer cell, binds to a protein that promotes cancer growth, and destroys that protein along with the cancer cell. Dr. Edith Perez headed research into the drugs effectiveness for early breast cancer. She works with the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville Florida. Dr. EDITH PEREZ (Researcher, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville Florida): By giving this therapy, added to other standard therapies, such are surgery and chemotherapy, we can further decrease the risk of the cancer returning by 52 percent. We can improve the likelihood that people will be alive at three to four years, by a third. NEIGHMOND: Which means after surgery, chemo, and Herceptin treatment, 87 percent of breast cancer patients were alive after three years. Patients are still being followed says Perez, and nearing the six year mark, the drug still looks effective. This is remarkable news, Perez says, especially since the type of cancer Herceptin works against is particularly aggressive. It's called Her2 Positive Breast Cancer. Dr. PEREZ: They look more aggressive under the microscope and they tend to return quicker, and they tend to lead to increased death rate compared to Her2 Negative Breast Cancers. NEIGHMOND: About a year and a half ago researchers, including Dr. Perez, made a dramatic decision. They called a halt to two studies examining the effectiveness of Herceptin in early cancer because the drug had been so successful. Over three thousand women were taking part in the study. After the studies were stopped, all of the women were offered the treatment. 36 year-old Christy Maines was lucky. She took part in the study and received Herceptin all along. She was only 32 when she was diagnosed with breast cancer. She had a 16- month-old baby. Ms. CHRISTY MAINES (study participant): There was a 70 percent chance that because of the size of my tumors and the spread in the 18 months node size, there was a 70 percent chance that it would metastasize in other organs within five years and there was little hope of survival. NEIGHMOND: Maines is convinced Herceptin saved her life. And today her life is healthy and whole. Ms. MAINES: Oh I'm perfect. I'm running my third marathon next month. I'm in great health. Now my daughter is five. I didn't think I'd see her go to kindergarten, and you know, she's five - so it's a whole new life. NEIGHMOND: There are side effects to Herceptin. Christy Maines says she had none. But in about three-and-a-half percent of women it causes congestive heart failure. But that can easily be treated, says Dr. Perez, with typical heart medications like ACE Inhibitors and BETA Blockers. Herceptin costs about $50 thousand a year. It's given by injection once a week for one year. Most insurers do cover the cost. Perez says that FDA approval would make treatment even more widely available to breast cancer patients by eliminating any doubt doctors might have about prescribing the treatment and by encouraging insurance companies to pay for it.

I want you to ask your nearest mathematician, of course the person sitting next to you, what he or she knows about Nicolas Bourbaki. And you're in for a long answer because author Amir Aczel first encountered this legend as an undergraduate math major in the University of California at Berkeley. That was some time ago. And it goes something like this. And I'm going to have him fill in the end. I'll just tell you the beginning. In the 1930s, a French mathematician by the name of Nicolas Bourbaki set out to unify and redefine mathematics. And he published many papers, many books. His works were considered some of the most widely influential mathematic text of the 20th century. For example, do you remember the new math you learned as a kid? Well he's probably responsible for that. There's only one little fly in this ointment, and that is Nicolas Bourbaki never existed. He was all a hoax. The math was real; the person wasn't. So who was he? My next guest, Amir Aczel, has written extensively on science and mathematics, including the books, The Riddle of the Compass, Fermat's Last Theorem; his latest book is The Artist and the Mathematician, tells the story of how Nicolas Bourbaki came to be and how the longest running joke in mathematics has changed the world. Dr. Aczel is a visiting scholar in the history of science at Harvard and a research fellow at Boston University. And he joins us today in our SCIENCE FRIDAY studios. Welcome back to the program. Dr. AMIR ACZEL (Author, The Artist and the Mathematician): Thank you. It's a pleasure to be here. FLATOW: Did mathematicians know this was a hoax all this time when you were an undergraduate and you heard about him or - and you just play along with this, or what's the story on this? Dr. ACZEL: Well, when I was an undergraduate he was already well known in America. FLATOW: Yeah. Dr. ACZEL: In France, it was well known earlier. In one of the stories that - the funniest stories about Bourbaki is that they weren't sure whether Americans and people in other countries knew about them. And at some point Bourbaki -  actually Andre Weil who was one of the main members, he pronounced it Vay(ph), one of the founders - they key founder wrote a letter to the American Mathematical Society in Providence, Rhode Island, saying I request membership in the American Mathematical Society. (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: Under that name. Dr. ACZEL: Yes. FLATOW: Why was that name chosen? Dr. ACZEL: Well the name was chosen because there was a general, a German - I'm sorry, a Greek - of Greek origin, a French of Greek of origin by the name of Charles Bourbaki, who was a general and lost France, a major battle against oppression. So he was an anti-hero. And he tried to commit suicide and couldn't succeed either. So he was a real loser. And these French mathematicians, who loved jokes and pranks, chose his name for their group. I wanted to add, though, that Ralph Boas, who was the secretary of the American Mathematical Society, already knew who Bourbaki was. FLATOW: Ah. Dr. ACZEL: This was in the '50s. FLATOW: Right. Dr. ACZEL: So he wrote a letter back to France saying, I understand this is not an application from an individual. You'll have to pay the institutional rate, which is much higher. (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: Talking with Amir Aczel, the author of The Artist and the Mathematician: The Story of Nicolas Bourbaki, the Genius Mathematician Who Never Existed on TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. Why create him? I mean, why - was this just a joke, really, of mathematicians who are because they're kind of funny people creating this fictitious person? Dr. ACZEL: Yes. They loved pranks. But in addition to that there was a reason behind that. And the reason was that French mathematics was not doing very well in the beginning part of the 20th century. There was a book by a person named Gorsa(ph), who was really not a very good textbook writer. And this was used in their calculus sequence, which is the most important basic math course. FLATOW: Right. Dr. ACZEL: And students were not doing well. It was poorly written. The examples were bad. It was just a very bad textbook. So these six mathematicians by the name of Cartan, Chevalley, Delsarte, Dieudonne, Possel, and Weil, met together in a caf\u00e9 in Paris. And the caf\u00e9 is in the best place in Paris, of course. FLATOW: Of course. But of course. Dr. ACZEL: Yes. It's on the Boulevard Saint-Michel, right next to the, below the Pantheon in the center. Today it's a like a McDonald's, a French type of McDonald's. But there used to be a great caf\u00e9 there. They met there. And they said, let's beat this guy, Gorsa. We'll write our own textbook. And since textbooks can't be written or they didn't think could be written by six people or they - and they didn't want to reveal their identities. They were the young Turks who were trying to take over French mathematics on the older generation. So they decided to invent this person that didn't exist. Now there's a history behind it. Andre Weil was really into these jokes. He just loved these jokes. And a few years earlier in 1923 a person by the name of Raoul Husson, H-u-s-s-o-n, played a prank on all the entering class in mathematics at the Ecole Normal Superieure, one of the main - the most prestigious French schools where mathematics was very important. And he gathered all the freshman in a room and came dressed with a fake beard and strange outfit to look like the general, and wrote on the board, Theorem of Bourbaki, you are to prove the following. And of course it was all nonsense. And the people were sitting there scratching their heads trying to figure out what it was. And they eventually knew it was a prank. He wasn't one of the people who were there. He had heard about it. Somebody came to him and said, you know, I really did understand that theorem. So it was a joke that seemed to work on people. FLATOW: Now what about all the mathematics that was behind it? Was it still - was the math a joke also or was it really good mathematics that they were coming out with? Dr. ACZEL: What they were creating was excellent mathematics. FLATOW: Right. Dr. ACZEL: And it is still affecting us today. FLATOW: Give us an idea of the kind of things. Dr. ACZEL: Well mathematics was not done very rigorously and not with great abstraction or generality at the time of Bourbaki in the '30s. The meeting in that caf\u00e9 was 1934. At that time, for example, Poincare, Henri Poincare, who is a very famous now because of the Poincare conjecture, was the epitome - he epitomized mathematics that was imprecise. He had a great insight and could do mathematics very, very well. But he didn't care about details, Epsilon, Delta type things, as mathematicians would say. He didn't care about very rigorous proofs. And that frame of mind entered into instruction mathematics. FLATOW: All right. We're going to have Amir take a breath, take a time out here. We're all going to come back and talk about this hoax of a mathematician. Stay with us. We'll be right back after this short break. I'm Ira Flatow. This is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. (Soundbite of music) FLATOW: This is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow. A brief program note, coming up on Monday Neal Conan talks with comedienne Paula Poundstone about her new book, The Best Part of Her Arrest, and why she never wins on WAIT, WAIT, DON'T TELL ME. Plus, O. J. Simpson's latest collision with the media spotlight. That's on Monday's TALK OF THE NATION. We're talking this hour on SCIENCE FRIDAY with Amir Aczel, author of The Artist and the Mathematician: The Story of Nicolas Bourbaki - got to get it right - The Genius Mathematician Who Never Existed, published this year by Thunder's Mouth Press. Amir, tell us about the accomplishments they did make, including, if I read correctly, this new math that we were all taught as kids. Dr. ACZEL: Right. So they were sitting in this caf\u00e9 in the heart of the Left Bank in Paris. And they're talking about, these six mathematicians, - later, a seventh joins later, some other - so the number after the first meeting is never precise. Nobody knows. FLATOW: They could keep this secret that this is a fictitious mathematician that they were imitating? Dr. ACZEL: Right. They could keep the secrets for quite a while. FLATOW: Yeah. Dr. ACZEL: And so they start with a very limited goal, which is to rewrite the calculus textbook of Gorsa for the next 25 years. But once their work starts developing, and they meet in resort towns. These French mathematicians love to spice up their life. FLATOW: Why not? Why not? Dr. ACZEL: Yes. They go to resorts, beaches, country inns, places like that, skiing areas. . . FLATOW: I'm living in the wrong era and the wrong business. Go ahead. Dr. ACZEL: So they really have a great time. And they realize that their project is growing and growing and becoming more important. And what it really becomes is Elements of Mathematics, as the volumes that they produce together. And that's named after Euclid's Elements. And instead of for the next 25 years, it's for the next 1,000 years. They're trying to rewrite mathematics for the next 1,000 years. And what they do is they start with set theory, and that's where the new math comes in. Since they decided to build mathematics up from the foundations, from set theory as a foundation, that gave people the idea that mathematics could be taught and new math could be taught starting the sets operations rather and numbers and equations and things like that. FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255 if you want to talk math with Amir Aczel, author of The Artist and the Mathematician. I guess for a joke they sure took it pretty seriously, didn't they? Dr. ACZEL: Yes. They took their jokes really seriously. FLATOW: Did they give Bourbaki a fake history, the whole bit? Did they have to defend who he was? Dr. ACZEL: Yes. They created a baptismal certificate for him. . . FLATOW: No kidding. Dr. ACZEL: . . . and a godmother whose name was Evalin de Possel(ph). She was the godmother. And he sprang into life already as an adult because he had a daughter who was getting married. Bourbaki's daughter is Betty, and she has wedding invitations sent, you know, in her name. FLATOW: Wow. Tell us about how Bourbaki nearly cost Andre Weil his life. Dr. ACZEL: Andre Weil was so taken with this joke. And there are other jokes that he liked. At one point there was somebody playing - Boulevard Mount Parnassus in Paris is called after Mount Parnassus which is - there was a pile of garbage there at the bottom of the center of Paris. And at some point there was somebody playing a prank on a passerby. He was standing behind a podium on the little stage there asking for money for the nation of Pauldavia(ph). He's the Prime Minister of Pauldavia whose people are so poor they have no money for pants. And then he steps away from the podium and you see he's wearing no pants. He's in his underwear. So Weil loved these jokes. And at some point, you know, he also didn't want to serve in the French army. So escaped to Finland and he's caught by the - in November 1939, as the Russians start bombing Helsinki his - the police suspect him. They arrest him and they find a fake identity that he has in the name of Nicolas Bourbaki and wedding invitations for Betty Bourbaki and calling cards in the name of Bourbaki. So they think obviously he's a spy. In addition, they find letters in Russian inviting him to give talks, mathematical talks in Russia. FLATOW: No kidding. Dr. ACZEL: But mathematician, he was no mathematician in (unintelligible). So they're sure he's a spy and they want to execute him. There's no trial here, nothing. But Weil's life was just like a fable. It's very strange, or a fairly tale. They're going to execute him as a spy. There's absolutely no doubt in anybody's mind that this is a Russian spy. In addition, he has been on the frontier area with Russia with his wife looking at things and writing things down. That was his papers. He was writing his mathematical papers. So they go to this official named Nevanlinna, Rolf Nevanlinna. And they say, tomorrow we're going to execute this guy but he says he knows you. Nevanlinna was related to - did some mathematics. And he says, what's his name? And he says Andre Weil. And he says, yes, I do know him. Do you really have to execute him? Why don't you just deport him to Sweden? And the head of police says, oh, that's something I hadn't thought of. So they deport him to Sweden instead of executing him. So it almost cost him his life, this idea of the prank of Bourbaki. FLATOW: Wow. That's very interesting. 1-800-989-8255. You know, I think if you ask anybody what they think of the stereotypical Hollywood mathematician or what happens when a group of mathematicians get together, they think it's going to be a lot of quiet little scribbling on a notepad. But that's not what happened when these guys got together, was it? Dr. ACZEL: No. They had wild parties everywhere. They had a good time, and in fact Bourbaki championed doing mathematics in nature. So they'd take a blackboard and put it outside in the park somewhere and do mathematics in the open. They really not only redid mathematics starting at the foundations of set theory and really introducing rigor into mathematics. Proofs had to proofs, not just hand waving, as mathematicians would say. So the mathematical proofs had to be correct and have some generality and abstractions so they are very valuable to mathematics today. So in a sense, what Bourbaki did - and this is being confronted by American and other mathematicians too, not just the French. Because of course the French would tell you Bourbaki was everything. But other mathematicians say too that in fact Bourbaki did introduce into 20th century mathematics this rigor and abstraction which we have today. So the reason that we have mathematical proofs done correctly and elegantly is due to Bourbaki, or started with the work of Bourbaki. FLATOW: When did the word get out? When was the cover blown? Dr. ACZEL: Well, the cover was blown during the war because the group dispersed. And Andre Weil came to this country. He was in New York in 1942, '43, then he was a - I'm sorry - he went to the University of Chicago and he died at Princeton in 1998. And once they spread around the world because of the Second World War, the word, you know, leaked out about Bourbaki. FLATOW: Are there still any groups that get together now? Dr. ACZEL: Yes. FLATOW: Any remnants of them? Dr. ACZEL: Yes. The Bourbaki group still exists in paper, but former members swear that Bourbaki is dead because they left. They had to leave at 50. Everybody who reaches age 50 is no longer a member of Bourbaki. And they make a strong case that the members of Bourbaki today, none of them are among the top French mathematician, top 40 French mathematicians, and therefore the group no longer exists, they say, and Bourbaki is dead. I did go to a seminar Bourbaki - a Bourbaki seminar in Paris and these were - in the heydays the rooms were full and there was excitement. A lot of mathematics - important mathematics was done there. When I came to this room in Ecole Normal Superieure where all these pranks took place - actually Institute on Refrancorei(ph), which is nearby. There's a little room there and probably 15 mathematicians sitting, half of them asleep, somebody writing on the board a theorem, and then they all left the room. So the excitement of the Bourbaki group is no longer there. FLATOW: Let me ask you this question, and just peripherally, because I watch this program called Numbers. Have you ever seen Numbers on television? Dr. ACZEL: No. FLATOW: This is a program that actually uses mathematics to solve crimes. You know, there are always crime-solving programs, but they use numbers and mathematics. And it's kind of interesting because they do generate an excitement of the kind that you are talking about, at least amongst the little group. Because you don't find very much excitement, you know, amongst students these days, you know, to study mathematics or to get them to study mathematics. Dr. ACZEL: Well, that's the problem with mathematics. What is mathematics? Mathematics is a very - it can be a very abstract structure up in the air here that has no real connection directly with the real world. Although, to argue that is to miss how mathematics developed. Of course, the ancient Greeks thought of it as a very abstract discipline. They called it geometry, and much of it was geometry. And they worked on theorems. They had no applications in the real world. But of course the calculus was developed by Newton and at the same time by Leibniz in Germany - he was actually living in Paris at that time - as a way of solving problems of the real world. And that's the beauty of the calculus. And there are other areas in mathematics that have very strong applications. So when you find amazing applications, that makes mathematics very exciting. And in fact Bourbaki did have some connections with the real world, despite the fact that all said their pure mathematicians with no interest in the world around him. FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255. Let's get a phone call or two. Mike in Kansas City, Kansas. Hi, Mike. MIKE (Caller): Hi. Hey, I've got and survived college calculus - and actually even use it every now and then - but I don't really remember how I learned the basic math and I don't quite understand what you mean by talking about formulas versus sets. And how do people learn from the beginning? FLATOW: When you talk about the - when you talked about they brought rigorousness to mathematics what do you mean by that? MIKE: Right. FLATOW: Until the late (unintelligible) Dr. ACZEL: Well, what I mean is there is a substructure behind mathematics that tells you how to do a proof, a mathematical proof. Now let me try to answer the question. When you're talking about calculus, you're talking about a certain function. For example, you're taking the derivative or constructing the integral of that function. For example, x-squared, the integral would be x-cubed over three, the indefinite integral. So that's what you would be doing in calculus. There are no sets here. We're talking about a function. MIKE: Right. Dr. ACZEL: And you're finding the integral or the derivatives, which is the opposite of finding an integral. So when you do that there's rarely any idea of a set behind it. But when you start doing mathematics, you're talking about open sets and closed sets. FLATOW: Sets means a group of numbers or range. Dr. ACZEL: Yes. Exactly. Now in the case of calculus, usually it would be talking about an interval of numbers as the sets. It could be an open interval from zero to five, not including zero and five. MIKE: Right. Dr. ACZEL: Or it could be the closed interval, which means including the endpoints. So here you have the set as a set of numbers on which you are operating. You are trying to find the integral, the derivative of a certain range of numbers. That range of numbers is the set. So these sets sort of underlie the calculus that's above you. FLATOW: I understand now my calc 101 class 35 years ago. It was 8 o'clock in the morning at Buffalo. It's not easy to study calculus. That first day when (unintelligible) professor wrote a big thing of sets down - I couldn't understand what it had to do with calculus. Now, it's forty years later I figured - I'm glad you came today. Dr. ACZEL: Okay. FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255 is our number. Let's go to the phones. Let's go Joe in Oxford, Ohio. Hi, Joe. JOE (Caller): Hello. I have a comment about Bourbaki that you might be interested in hearing. I had Zorn for a text as a course in the late '50s. Zorn is the man from him Zorn's. . . FLATOW: Zorn's lemma, right. JOE: Well, anyway, Zorn had us use for a text Bourbaki's set theory. FLATOW: Wow. JOE: It was written in French. Zorn was a - is a German and he spoke English - or German with English words in it, and it was hard to understand what was going on. And he was just as abstract as he could possibly be. He would never tell you anything. He would write stuff on the board that didn't make any sense and you had to scramble to try to understand it. It was a beautiful course. I don't think I ever had a course that I enjoyed any more. Just struggling all the time to try to make some sense of it and in the - as a result you learned a great deal of mathematics. It was wonderful. FLATOW: Let me just remind everybody that this is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. I'm Ira Flatow talking with Amir Ace, author of the Artist and the Mathematician. Amir, what do you react to. . . Dr. ACZEL: I'm not surprised that it was abstract because Zorn's lemma is a very abstract lemma in mathematics. . . JOE: Yes. Dr. ACZEL: . . . in the foundations of mathematics. JOE: Yes. This is a - so difficult course. FLATOW: Did you have - Joe, did you have to teach yourself this basically, then? JOE: Well, yeah. A lot of it, yeah. It was very - you just scrambled all the time trying to guess what was going on. But that was - the best part of it was trying to make some sense out of the thing. FLATOW: Yeah. JOE: And as a result, you learned a great deal about yourself and about the material. FLATOW: Thanks for calling. Have a good weekend. JOE: Thank you. FLATOW: You said that there were some practical things that came out of this. . . Dr. ACZEL: Yes. FLATOW: . . . as Bourbaki. Can you give us - well, I assume. . . Dr. ACZEL: Oh, yes. I have a wonderful story that's my favorite story in the whole book. FLATOW: Well, we've got to hear your favorite story. Dr. ACZEL: This happened in New York in 1943. Andre Weil came here, by the way, after avoiding being executed. He had to be deported back to France from Sweden and Britain. FLATOW: Wow. Dr. ACZEL: And he - they put him - he was supposed to serve in the army, which is why he was in trouble, as an officer but he became a private to avoid greater punishment than that. He sort of escaped to Britain with the rest of the troops, was repatriated to France and ended up in New York, like many Jewish refugees during the war. So he was here in New York. And Claude Levi-Strauss, the famous anthropologist was here too; also being Jewish, also playing the Nazis who lived here in New York and worked at the school for - the new school. FLATOW: Right. Dr. ACZEL: For social research. And he was working on a very interesting problem about Australian aborigines, and I actually went to Australia in part to research that story. The tribes of aborigines - they live under amazing laws that go back perhaps 50,000 years because Australian aborigines supposedly came 50,000 years ago to Australia. And their societies haven't really changed. They are contiguous, they remain there and they're descendants of descendants and so on. And the rules are very strange. You must marry your father's sister's daughters if you're a guy, if such a person exists. And you are not allowed to marry your mother's brother's daughter. So these are cross cousins, one is taboo and the other one is a must-marry. And I actually interviewed the woman who - a white woman who lived among these tribes for a while, and she said people who are taboo, you're not even allowed to look at them. And everybody in the tribe knows who is taboo and who is must-marry. So are - and people - other people are sort of neutral. FLATOW: Right. Dr. ACZEL: So Claude Levi-Strauss was working on the very beginnings of structural anthropology and trying to solve the mystery of these marriages. Why? Why do you have these rules? FLATOW: Right. Dr. ACZEL: And what do they tell you about the society that has these such rules. Is it one society or is it really several groups living together who never intermarry. And he couldn't solve it in any way and he realized that mathematics could give him the answer. He came to a person named Jacques Hadamard, which is a very famous French mathematician. He was very - he was rather old at the time, and also Jewish, was also escaping Europe for New York. And he came to him, and Hadamard looks at him in a very typically French way. He says mathematics has four operations. He meant addition, subtraction, multiplication, division. of course there's exponentiation, too FLATOW: I got 45 seconds, Amir. . . Dr. ACZEL: Sure. And then he says mathematic - I'm sorry - marriage is not one of these operations. But Weil solved his problem using abstract algebra. He used group theory. FLATOW: Wow. Dr. ACZEL: A very abstract area to solve practice problem of Australian aboriginal on marriage laws. FLATOW: That's a great - and it's in your book. Dr. ACZEL: Thank you. Yes. FLATOW: If you want to read the book, I highly recommend it. It's the Artist and the Mathematician: The Story of Nicholas Bourbaki, the Genius Mathematician Who Never Existed. It's been my pleasure to have Amir Aczel back here with us on SCIENCE FRIDAY. Good luck to you. Dr. ACZEL: Oh, thanks. FLATOW: Thank you for coming on and being with us today. Dr. ACZEL: Sure, I do. FLATOW: Have a great weekend. We'll see you next week. I'm Ira Flatow in New York.  IRA FLATOW, host:  Up next, another sort of mystery about a mathematician. I want you to ask your nearest mathematician, of course the person sitting next to you, what he or she knows about Nicolas Bourbaki.  And you're in for a long answer because author Amir Aczel first encountered this legend as an undergraduate math major in the University of California at Berkeley. That was some time ago.  And it goes something like this. And I'm going to have him fill in the end. I'll just tell you the beginning. In the 1930s, a French mathematician by the name of Nicolas Bourbaki set out to unify and redefine mathematics. And he published many papers, many books. His works were considered some of the most widely influential mathematic text of the 20th century.  For example, do you remember the new math you learned as a kid? Well he's probably responsible for that.  There's only one little fly in this ointment, and that is Nicolas Bourbaki never existed. He was all a hoax. The math was real; the person wasn't. So who was he?  My next guest, Amir Aczel, has written extensively on science and mathematics, including the books, The Riddle of the Compass, Fermat's Last Theorem; his latest book is The Artist and the Mathematician, tells the story of how Nicolas Bourbaki came to be and how the longest running joke in mathematics has changed the world.  Dr. Aczel is a visiting scholar in the history of science at Harvard and a research fellow at Boston University. And he joins us today in our SCIENCE FRIDAY studios. Welcome back to the program.  Dr. AMIR ACZEL (Author, The Artist and the Mathematician): Thank you. It's a pleasure to be here.  FLATOW: Did mathematicians know this was a hoax all this time when you were an undergraduate and you heard about him or - and you just play along with this, or what's the story on this?  Dr. ACZEL: Well, when I was an undergraduate he was already well known in America.  FLATOW: Yeah.  Dr. ACZEL: In France, it was well known earlier. In one of the stories that - the funniest stories about Bourbaki is that they weren't sure whether Americans and people in other countries knew about them. And at some point Bourbaki -  actually Andre Weil who was one of the main members, he pronounced it Vay(ph), one of the founders - they key founder wrote a letter to the American Mathematical Society in Providence, Rhode Island, saying I request membership in the American Mathematical Society.  (Soundbite of laughter)  FLATOW: Under that name.  Dr. ACZEL: Yes.  FLATOW: Why was that name chosen?  Dr. ACZEL: Well the name was chosen because there was a general, a German - I'm sorry, a Greek - of Greek origin, a French of Greek of origin by the name of Charles Bourbaki, who was a general and lost France, a major battle against oppression.  So he was an anti-hero. And he tried to commit suicide and couldn't succeed either. So he was a real loser. And these French mathematicians, who loved jokes and pranks, chose his name for their group.  I wanted to add, though, that Ralph Boas, who was the secretary of the American Mathematical Society, already knew who Bourbaki was.  FLATOW: Ah.  Dr. ACZEL: This was in the '50s.  FLATOW: Right.  Dr. ACZEL: So he wrote a letter back to France saying, I understand this is not an application from an individual. You'll have to pay the institutional rate, which is much higher.  (Soundbite of laughter)  FLATOW: Talking with Amir Aczel, the author of The Artist and the Mathematician: The Story of Nicolas Bourbaki, the Genius Mathematician Who Never Existed on TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.  Why create him? I mean, why - was this just a joke, really, of mathematicians who are because they're kind of funny people creating this fictitious person?  Dr. ACZEL: Yes. They loved pranks. But in addition to that there was a reason behind that. And the reason was that French mathematics was not doing very well in the beginning part of the 20th century.  There was a book by a person named Gorsa(ph), who was really not a very good textbook writer. And this was used in their calculus sequence, which is the most important basic math course.  FLATOW: Right.  Dr. ACZEL: And students were not doing well. It was poorly written. The examples were bad. It was just a very bad textbook.  So these six mathematicians by the name of Cartan, Chevalley, Delsarte, Dieudonne, Possel, and Weil, met together in a caf\u00e9 in Paris. And the caf\u00e9 is in the best place in Paris, of course.  FLATOW: Of course. But of course.  Dr. ACZEL: Yes. It's on the Boulevard Saint-Michel, right next to the, below the Pantheon in the center. Today it's a like a McDonald's, a French type of McDonald's.  But there used to be a great caf\u00e9 there. They met there. And they said, let's beat this guy, Gorsa. We'll write our own textbook. And since textbooks can't be written or they didn't think could be written by six people or they - and they didn't want to reveal their identities. They were the young Turks who were trying to take over French mathematics on the older generation.  So they decided to invent this person that didn't exist. Now there's a history behind it. Andre Weil was really into these jokes. He just loved these jokes.  And a few years earlier in 1923 a person by the name of Raoul Husson, H-u-s-s-o-n, played a prank on all the entering class in mathematics at the Ecole Normal Superieure, one of the main - the most prestigious French schools where mathematics was very important.  And he gathered all the freshman in a room and came dressed with a fake beard and strange outfit to look like the general, and wrote on the board, Theorem of Bourbaki, you are to prove the following.  And of course it was all nonsense. And the people were sitting there scratching their heads trying to figure out what it was. And they eventually knew it was a prank. He wasn't one of the people who were there. He had heard about it.  Somebody came to him and said, you know, I really did understand that theorem. So it was a joke that seemed to work on people.  FLATOW: Now what about all the mathematics that was behind it? Was it still - was the math a joke also or was it really good mathematics that they were coming out with?  Dr. ACZEL: What they were creating was excellent mathematics.  FLATOW: Right.  Dr. ACZEL: And it is still affecting us today.  FLATOW: Give us an idea of the kind of things.  Dr. ACZEL: Well mathematics was not done very rigorously and not with great abstraction or generality at the time of Bourbaki in the '30s. The meeting in that caf\u00e9 was 1934.  At that time, for example, Poincare, Henri Poincare, who is a very famous now because of the Poincare conjecture, was the epitome - he epitomized mathematics that was imprecise. He had a great insight and could do mathematics very, very well. But he didn't care about details, Epsilon, Delta type things, as mathematicians would say. He didn't care about very rigorous proofs. And that frame of mind entered into instruction mathematics.  FLATOW: All right. We're going to have Amir take a breath, take a time out here. We're all going to come back and talk about this hoax of a mathematician. Stay with us. We'll be right back after this short break.  I'm Ira Flatow.

These French mathematicians love to spice up their life.  FLATOW: Why not? Why not?  Dr. ACZEL: Yes. They go to resorts, beaches, country inns, places like that, skiing areas. . .  FLATOW: I'm living in the wrong era and the wrong business. Go ahead.  Dr. ACZEL: So they really have a great time. And they realize that their project is growing and growing and becoming more important. And what it really becomes is Elements of Mathematics, as the volumes that they produce together.  And that's named after Euclid's Elements. And instead of for the next 25 years, it's for the next 1,000 years. They're trying to rewrite mathematics for the next 1,000 years.

They took their jokes really seriously.  FLATOW: Did they give Bourbaki a fake history, the whole bit? Did they have to defend who he was?  Dr. ACZEL: Yes. They created a baptismal certificate for him. . .  FLATOW: No kidding.  Dr. ACZEL: . . . and a godmother whose name was Evalin de Possel(ph). She was the godmother.

Tell us about how Bourbaki nearly cost Andre Weil his life.  Dr. ACZEL: Andre Weil was so taken with this joke. And there are other jokes that he liked.

He's the Prime Minister of Pauldavia whose people are so poor they have no money for pants.  And then he steps away from the podium and you see he's wearing no pants. He's in his underwear. So Weil loved these jokes. And at some point, you know, he also didn't want to serve in the French army. So escaped to Finland and he's caught by the - in November 1939, as the Russians start bombing Helsinki his - the police suspect him. They arrest him and they find a fake identity that he has in the name of Nicolas Bourbaki and wedding invitations for Betty Bourbaki and calling cards in the name of Bourbaki.  So they think obviously he's a spy. In addition, they find letters in Russian inviting him to give talks, mathematical talks in Russia.  FLATOW: No kidding.  Dr. ACZEL: But mathematician, he was no mathematician in (unintelligible). So they're sure he's a spy and they want to execute him. There's no trial here, nothing.  But Weil's life was just like a fable. It's very strange, or a fairly tale. They're going to execute him as a spy. There's absolutely no doubt in anybody's mind that this is a Russian spy.  In addition, he has been on the frontier area with Russia with his wife looking at things and writing things down. That was his papers. He was writing his mathematical papers.  So they go to this official named Nevanlinna, Rolf Nevanlinna. And they say, tomorrow we're going to execute this guy but he says he knows you. Nevanlinna was related to - did some mathematics.  And he says, what's his name? And he says Andre Weil. And he says, yes, I do know him. Do you really have to execute him? Why don't you just deport him to Sweden?  And the head of police says, oh, that's something I hadn't thought of. So they deport him to Sweden instead of executing him. So it almost cost him his life, this idea of the prank of Bourbaki.  FLATOW: Wow. That's very interesting.  1-800-989-8255. You know, I think if you ask anybody what they think of the stereotypical Hollywood mathematician or what happens when a group of mathematicians get together, they think it's going to be a lot of quiet little scribbling on a notepad. But that's not what happened when these guys got together, was it?  Dr. ACZEL: No. They had wild parties everywhere. They had a good time, and in fact Bourbaki championed doing mathematics in nature. So they'd take a blackboard and put it outside in the park somewhere and do mathematics in the open. They really not only redid mathematics starting at the foundations of set theory and really introducing rigor into mathematics.  Proofs had to proofs, not just hand waving, as mathematicians would say. So the mathematical proofs had to be correct and have some generality and abstractions so they are very valuable to mathematics today. So in a sense, what Bourbaki did - and this is being confronted by American and other mathematicians too, not just the French. Because of course the French would tell you Bourbaki was everything.  But other mathematicians say too that in fact Bourbaki did introduce into 20th century mathematics this rigor and abstraction which we have today. So the reason that we have mathematical proofs done correctly and elegantly is due to Bourbaki, or started with the work of Bourbaki.  FLATOW: When did the word get out? When was the cover blown?  Dr. ACZEL: Well, the cover was blown during the war because the group dispersed. And Andre Weil came to this country. He was in New York in 1942, '43, then he was a - I'm sorry - he went to the University of Chicago and he died at Princeton in 1998. And once they spread around the world because of the Second World War, the word, you know, leaked out about Bourbaki.  FLATOW: Are there still any groups that get together now?  Dr. ACZEL: Yes.  FLATOW: Any remnants of them?  Dr. ACZEL: Yes. The Bourbaki group still exists in paper, but former members swear that Bourbaki is dead because they left. They had to leave at 50. Everybody who reaches age 50 is no longer a member of Bourbaki. And they make a strong case that the members of Bourbaki today, none of them are among the top French mathematician, top 40 French mathematicians, and therefore the group no longer exists, they say, and Bourbaki is dead.  I did go to a seminar Bourbaki - a Bourbaki seminar in Paris and these were - in the heydays the rooms were full and there was excitement. A lot of mathematics - important mathematics was done there. When I came to this room in Ecole Normal Superieure where all these pranks took place - actually Institute on Refrancorei(ph), which is nearby.  There's a little room there and probably 15 mathematicians sitting, half of them asleep, somebody writing on the board a theorem, and then they all left the room. So the excitement of the Bourbaki group is no longer there.  FLATOW: Let me ask you this question, and just peripherally, because I watch this program called Numbers. Have you ever seen Numbers on television?  Dr. ACZEL: No.  FLATOW: This is a program that actually uses mathematics to solve crimes. You know, there are always crime-solving programs, but they use numbers and mathematics. And it's kind of interesting because they do generate an excitement of the kind that you are talking about, at least amongst the little group. Because you don't find very much excitement, you know, amongst students these days, you know, to study mathematics or to get them to study mathematics.  Dr. ACZEL: Well, that's the problem with mathematics. What is mathematics? Mathematics is a very - it can be a very abstract structure up in the air here that has no real connection directly with the real world. Although, to argue that is to miss how mathematics developed.  Of course, the ancient Greeks thought of it as a very abstract discipline. They called it geometry, and much of it was geometry. And they worked on theorems. They had no applications in the real world. But of course the calculus was developed by Newton and at the same time by Leibniz in Germany - he was actually living in Paris at that time - as a way of solving problems of the real world. And that's the beauty of the calculus. And there are other areas in mathematics that have very strong applications. So when you find amazing applications, that makes mathematics very exciting.  And in fact Bourbaki did have some connections with the real world, despite the fact that all said their pure mathematicians with no interest in the world around him.  FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255. Let's get a phone call or two. Mike in Kansas City, Kansas. Hi, Mike.  MIKE (Caller): Hi. Hey, I've got and survived college calculus - and actually even use it every now and then - but I don't really remember how I learned the basic math and I don't quite understand what you mean by talking about formulas versus sets. And how do people learn from the beginning?  FLATOW: When you talk about the - when you talked about they brought rigorousness to mathematics what do you mean by that?  MIKE: Right.  FLATOW: Until the late (unintelligible)  Dr. ACZEL: Well, what I mean is there is a substructure behind mathematics that tells you how to do a proof, a mathematical proof. Now let me try to answer the question. When you're talking about calculus, you're talking about a certain function. For example, you're taking the derivative or constructing the integral of that function. For example, x-squared, the integral would be x-cubed over three, the indefinite integral.  So that's what you would be doing in calculus. There are no sets here. We're talking about a function.  MIKE: Right.  Dr. ACZEL: And you're finding the integral or the derivatives, which is the opposite of finding an integral. So when you do that there's rarely any idea of a set behind it. But when you start doing mathematics, you're talking about open sets and closed sets.  FLATOW: Sets means a group of numbers or range.  Dr. ACZEL: Yes. Exactly. Now in the case of calculus, usually it would be talking about an interval of numbers as the sets. It could be an open interval from zero to five, not including zero and five.  MIKE: Right.  Dr. ACZEL: Or it could be the closed interval, which means including the endpoints. So here you have the set as a set of numbers on which you are operating. You are trying to find the integral, the derivative of a certain range of numbers. That range of numbers is the set. So these sets sort of underlie the calculus that's above you.  FLATOW: I understand now my calc 101 class 35 years ago. It was 8 o'clock in the morning at Buffalo. It's not easy to study calculus. That first day when (unintelligible) professor wrote a big thing of sets down - I couldn't understand what it had to do with calculus. Now, it's forty years later I figured - I'm glad you came today.  Dr. ACZEL: Okay.  FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255 is our number. Let's go to the phones. Let's go Joe in Oxford, Ohio. Hi, Joe.  JOE (Caller): Hello. I have a comment about Bourbaki that you might be interested in hearing. I had Zorn for a text as a course in the late '50s. Zorn is the man from him Zorn's. . .  FLATOW: Zorn's lemma, right.  JOE: Well, anyway, Zorn had us use for a text Bourbaki's set theory.  FLATOW: Wow.  JOE: It was written in French. Zorn was a - is a German and he spoke English - or German with English words in it, and it was hard to understand what was going on. And he was just as abstract as he could possibly be. He would never tell you anything. He would write stuff on the board that didn't make any sense and you had to scramble to try to understand it. It was a beautiful course.  I don't think I ever had a course that I enjoyed any more. Just struggling all the time to try to make some sense of it and in the - as a result you learned a great deal of mathematics. It was wonderful.  FLATOW: Let me just remind everybody that this is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. I'm Ira Flatow talking with Amir Ace, author of the Artist and the Mathematician. Amir, what do you react to. . .  Dr. ACZEL: I'm not surprised that it was abstract because Zorn's lemma is a very abstract lemma in mathematics. . .  JOE: Yes.  Dr. ACZEL: . . . in the foundations of mathematics.  JOE: Yes. This is a - so difficult course.  FLATOW: Did you have - Joe, did you have to teach yourself this basically, then?  JOE: Well, yeah. A lot of it, yeah. It was very - you just scrambled all the time trying to guess what was going on. But that was - the best part of it was trying to make some sense out of the thing.  FLATOW: Yeah.  JOE: And as a result, you learned a great deal about yourself and about the material.  FLATOW: Thanks for calling. Have a good weekend.  JOE: Thank you.  FLATOW: You said that there were some practical things that came out of this. . .  Dr. ACZEL: Yes.  FLATOW: . . . as Bourbaki. Can you give us - well, I assume. . .  Dr. ACZEL: Oh, yes. I have a wonderful story that's my favorite story in the whole book.  FLATOW: Well, we've got to hear your favorite story.  Dr. ACZEL: This happened in New York in 1943. Andre Weil came here, by the way, after avoiding being executed. He had to be deported back to France from Sweden and Britain.  FLATOW: Wow.  Dr. ACZEL: And he - they put him - he was supposed to serve in the army, which is why he was in trouble, as an officer but he became a private to avoid greater punishment than that. He sort of escaped to Britain with the rest of the troops, was repatriated to France and ended up in New York, like many Jewish refugees during the war.  So he was here in New York. And Claude Levi-Strauss, the famous anthropologist was here too; also being Jewish, also playing the Nazis who lived here in New York and worked at the school for - the new school.  FLATOW: Right.  Dr. ACZEL: For social research. And he was working on a very interesting problem about Australian aborigines, and I actually went to Australia in part to research that story. The tribes of aborigines - they live under amazing laws that go back perhaps 50,000 years because Australian aborigines supposedly came 50,000 years ago to Australia.  And their societies haven't really changed. They are contiguous, they remain there and they're descendants of descendants and so on. And the rules are very strange. You must marry your father's sister's daughters if you're a guy, if such a person exists. And you are not allowed to marry your mother's brother's daughter. So these are cross cousins, one is taboo and the other one is a must-marry.  And I actually interviewed the woman who - a white woman who lived among these tribes for a while, and she said people who are taboo, you're not even allowed to look at them. And everybody in the tribe knows who is taboo and who is must-marry. So are - and people - other people are sort of neutral.  FLATOW: Right.  Dr. ACZEL: So Claude Levi-Strauss was working on the very beginnings of structural anthropology and trying to solve the mystery of these marriages. Why? Why do you have these rules?  FLATOW: Right.  Dr. ACZEL: And what do they tell you about the society that has these such rules. Is it one society or is it really several groups living together who never intermarry. And he couldn't solve it in any way and he realized that mathematics could give him the answer.  He came to a person named Jacques Hadamard, which is a very famous French mathematician. He was very - he was rather old at the time, and also Jewish, was also escaping Europe for New York. And he came to him, and Hadamard looks at him in a very typically French way. He says mathematics has four operations. He meant addition, subtraction, multiplication, division. of course there's exponentiation, too  FLATOW: I got 45 seconds, Amir. . .  Dr. ACZEL: Sure. And then he says mathematic - I'm sorry - marriage is not one of these operations. But Weil solved his problem using abstract algebra. He used group theory.  FLATOW: Wow.  Dr. ACZEL: A very abstract area to solve practice problem of Australian aboriginal on marriage laws.  FLATOW: That's a great - and it's in your book.  Dr. ACZEL: Thank you. Yes.  FLATOW: If you want to read the book, I highly recommend it. It's the Artist and the Mathematician: The Story of Nicholas Bourbaki, the Genius Mathematician Who Never Existed. It's been my pleasure to have Amir Aczel back here with us on SCIENCE FRIDAY. Good luck to you.  Dr. ACZEL: Oh, thanks.  FLATOW: Thank you for coming on and being with us today.  Dr. ACZEL: Sure, I do.  FLATOW: Have a great weekend. We'll see you next week. I'm Ira Flatow in New York. ", "section": "Science", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2006 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Can renewable energy sources like wind and solar and water, can they make a real dent in fulfilling our growing energy demand without making a huge dent in our wallets? Right now about 6 percent of the energy we use comes from renewables. A plan called 25 by 25 - we talked about it here a few months ago - that plan as its goal to supply 25 percent of our energy from renewable sources by the year 2025. And critics of this plan warn that renewables are just too expensive to compete with entrenched and cheaper fossil fuels. And they say that meeting this goal will mean more expensive energy for all of us. But a new study by the Rand Corporation put that claim to the test and found that under certain conditions, bringing more renewables into our energy mix wont' spell economic doom. Michael Tillman is a senior economist and director of the Environment, Energy and Economic Development Program at the Rand Corporation in Arlington, Virginia. He joins us today from Rand. Welcome to the program. Mr. MICHAEL TILLMAN (Senior Economist and Director, Rand Corporation): Thank you. It's a real pleasure to be on with you. FLATOW: Thank you. What are these certain conditions that will make these competitive? Mr. TILLMAN: The basic conditions that we look at - and I should say the Rand study looked at a lot of situations in which renewable energy improved relative to non-renewable in its cost, and a lot where it didn't improve as quickly. So we looked at a very wide range of possibilities so that we could cover the bases. If we can have renewable technologies improve, relative to non-renewable in terms of cost at the rate we've seen over the past 20 years, roughly 20 percent or more; and if we can have fossil fuel prices that stay high enough that there is in fact room in the market for these resources; then we are able to find that penetration of renewables can occur without increasing overall energy costs. Now, the individual renewables may still be more expensive. In fact, we find that in many cases the alcohol fuel that's used to displace gasoline and the renewable wind or biomass - you know, plant matter that used to make electricity - these individual sources are more expensive. But because they reduce the demand for coal, and gas, and oil, people that are still consuming these resources would pay a lot less. So nationally, the cost can be about a wash. But depending on what kind of energy you use and how much, you may find that your energy bill grows or shrinks. FLATOW: Does this require market forces to control the future, or do we have actually to set an agenda for this to happen and use ample tax breaks, whatever influences we can? Mr. TOMAN: The Rand study was policy-neutral on the sense that we didn't assume or analyze any specific measures. We started with this goal and we're backwards to see what the cost implications would be. Because there are many situations in this analysis in which the actual renewable resources are more expensive than their fossil fuel alternatives, these results stated that actually reached this goal some sort of policy would be needed and the kind of policy then would be something that we need to be argued about and studied further. FLATOW: I would - you're assuming that we are going to be making breakthroughs to make this happen or do you just consider that breakthroughs do happen as a natural course and progress goes in a straight line. Mr. TOMAN: Well, progress is assumed to more or less march forward incrementally more or like the straight line that you mentioned. There are though a couple of important technical assumptions that we should underscore for the sake of giving the listeners a complete picture, particularly in the area of alcohol fuels - ethanol that used to replace gasoline. Right now, we produce a fair amount of that but it's all produced from corn and other agricultural crops. And the ability to produce this is inherently limited by the amount of land we've got and the value of the other uses of these crops. So the Rand study is assuming that technology is currently underdevelopment for making alcohol out of trees and shrubs and other plant matter of that type. These technologies are underdevelopment today and we assumed that they become commercially feasible by the time the study term finishes, which is 2025. Doesn't mean that they're necessarily priced competitive, but we assume that they can be build and operated at a commercial scale. FLATOW: Does energy conservation fit in to this plan? Mr. TOMAN: Absolutely. As I mentioned before, a lot of the cost savings that we can get at the national level here, do not arise because we're using less expensive renewables instead of non-renewables is because we can make the price of non-renewable energy lower by reducing its demand. So we would expect to see the same direction, if not the same magnitude of effects if we, for example, could improve the energy efficiency of buildings or of automobiles so that we would also be reducing demand for domestic or imported non-renewable energy. FLATOW: Let's go back to your main conclusion - and you talked about this a little bit - that we can reach this goal of 25 percent renewables by 2025 without increasing overall energy cost. What would the cost to the individual consumer be? Because that's what we hear about on the campaign trails all the time, you know, it's your wallet that's going to be hit on it. Mr. TOMAN: Well, and that's, of course, where the votes lies as well as the individual household budget. We find, for example, that electricity prices might be increased on the order of 15 percent, which means that if you're paying about $1,000 a year for electricity, of course, that depends on where you live and how much you used, you might be paying another $150 a year for electricity. On the other hand, if you are driving a gasoline vehicle still in this scenario, gasoline prices might fall on the order of 5 percent. So if you're spending $3,000 a year then you would basically be getting back that $150 from your electric bill in terms of a lower price at the pump. So that kind of consumer would sort of break-even but consumers that used different mixes of energy would get different results. FLATOW: Do we have to depend on the energy producing company, the oil company, the utility companies to be active parts of this goal or do they come along and just follow economics? Mr. TOMAN: Well, because we started with the assumption that the goal would be met by somebody and then worked backwards to get the cost. Who actually would be involved in producing these fuels is something that the analysis doesn't speak to directly. We know already in the electric power sector, that a lot of small electricity producers using a variety of different technologies -including renewables - are producing or could be producing in the future, producing with wind or other renewable energy. We could see more of them coming into play if we had larger requirements for renewables in the power sector and they would simply connect up to the national grid and sell their electricity to the big utility companies that distribute it. The alcohol is produced by large producers today, that work with farmers and use the agricultural crops that make the alcohol. In the future, these other sources of alcohol could be produced by a number of smaller firms located in different places, depending on where the input material is located - near forest, near sawmills - wherever we can get the product. FLATOW: Uh hm. Do you see that the energy, the electric distribution grid has to be changed for this to work? Mr. TOMAN: We assumed that there would be some limits on the ability of this new renewable energy to get moved around, because even now, we find that there are occasions in which the existing grid is constrained in its ability to transmit power from place to place. When we have more decentralized, small sources of electricity - like wind generators or small boilers using trees and scrubs to make electric power -there would certainly be a need, I believe, to expand at least somewhat, the ability to connect these sources up to the grid. Because right now, the grid is really designed namely to connect large sources. FLATOW: It looks - because from my impression, and we do lots of programs about wind, for example - it's almost like there are - every state has decided to take this on in itself. There are communities that are building, you know, hundreds of megawatts of power. We have states that are creating their own electrical systems, as oppose to being a large integrated grid these days. Mr. TOMAN: Certainly there is a lot of movement. You see it in college campuses, communities, as you mentioned. There's a lot of this activity going on. But unfortunately, in most applications, large use of wind power is still not economic. Direct energy cost - it's roughly competitive or even a little better than natural gas, but the big problem is that the wind doesn't blow all the time in most places. So you still have to deal with backup power to cover you when the wind is not available, and by the time you take that into account, it's still is a bit more expensive than fossil energy. Where we see it in larger use, it's normally because states have mandated that their utility companies have a certain percentage of their power from renewable sources. FLATOW: Talking about the 2025 project on TALK OF THE NATION Science Friday from NPR News. I'm Ira Flatow with Michael Toman of the Rand Corporation. Reducing fossil fuel use, of course, an increasing renewables will resolve in the significant reduction in carbon dioxide emissions, won't it? Mr. TOMAN: Yes, it will. By cutting back on our use of coal, especially in the power sector because it has the most CO2 when it's burned. Also oil and natural gas. We estimate, in the sort of middle of the road case that we looked at, we could reduce emissions of CO2 in the U. S. by about 15 percent out in 2025. That doesn't sound like a real large number. But another way to look at it is that it would take up about two-thirds of the increase in emissions that might occur between now and 2025. So this level of substitution could be a significant contribution toward, at least, slowing the growth of emissions in this country. FLATOW: Let's go to Chuck in San Francisco. Hi, Chuck. CHUCK (Caller): Hi. I'm wondering if your study took into account the things like trade deficit, where we buy - where if we were to develop technologies that could be produced in this country it would create jobs and we wouldn't be sending as much money overseas for old tech and for fossil fuels - and it would there by benefit us economically. FLATOW: Yeah, will this create jobs? Mr. TOMAN: Well, the Rand study really only looked at the electricity and fuels parts of the economy, just the energy sector, itself. The caller's question about the larger ability of these investments to reduced trade deficits and help the economy is something that gets debated very often when we're looking at issues related to oil imports and other energy questions. We did not touch on that in this work. We focused directly on the issues of direct energy costs. FLATOW: Did - is it possible from your study to tell if we are actually on a road to 2025? The way we're heading now. Mr. TOMAN: At this point, there has been really only modest increases in renewable energy use in the last few years. We are seeing only in the last two years, of course, significant increases in oil prices. And if fossil energy prices stay high as we see them now, we would certainly expect to see the mix of energy adjusting over the longer term. Because coal is very plentiful, and except for greenhouse gases it can be used pretty cleanly these days, there is less likely to be a big movement toward an alternative in the power sector than there might be in the vehicle sector -where we are already seeing much more fuel efficient hybrids, for example, being sold. And certainly there is the possibility in the future, if the costs come down, of a market transition toward other sources besides gasoline. FLATOW: Uh hm but -Mr. TOMAN: But we're really only getting started with this now, and you don't see a significant movement in that direction at this stage. FLATOW: Is it going to take political leadership here? Mr. TOMAN: Well, because our results indicate that we probably cannot expect these technologies to transition directly into the market, just on the basis of their relative costs - you know, head to head with their alternatives - it would require some form of policy to first make the decision that we wanted to achieve this goal, and then to figure out how to go about doing it. So we would need leadership, first to weigh the pros and cons of doing this, and then to have, I think, a pretty complicated discussion about the ways that we would go about it. FLATOW: I want to thank you, Michael, for taking time to talk with us. Mr. TOMAN: It's been a great pleasure very much.

We find, for example, that electricity prices might be increased on the order of 15 percent, which means that if you're paying about $1,000 a year for electricity, of course, that depends on where you live and how much you used, you might be paying another $150 a year for electricity.  On the other hand, if you are driving a gasoline vehicle still in this scenario, gasoline prices might fall on the order of 5 percent. So if you're spending $3,000 a year then you would basically be getting back that $150 from your electric bill in terms of a lower price at the pump.  So that kind of consumer would sort of break-even but consumers that used different mixes of energy would get different results.  FLATOW: Do we have to depend on the energy producing company, the oil company, the utility companies to be active parts of this goal or do they come along and just follow economics?  Mr. TOMAN: Well, because we started with the assumption that the goal would be met by somebody and then worked backwards to get the cost. Who actually would be involved in producing these fuels is something that the analysis doesn't speak to directly. We know already in the electric power sector, that a lot of small electricity producers using a variety of different technologies -including renewables - are producing or could be producing in the future, producing with wind or other renewable energy.  We could see more of them coming into play if we had larger requirements for renewables in the power sector and they would simply connect up to the national grid and sell their electricity to the big utility companies that distribute it.  The alcohol is produced by large producers today, that work with farmers and use the agricultural crops that make the alcohol. In the future, these other sources of alcohol could be produced by a number of smaller firms located in different places, depending on where the input material is located - near forest, near sawmills - wherever we can get the product.  FLATOW: Uh hm. Do you see that the energy, the electric distribution grid has to be changed for this to work?  Mr. TOMAN: We assumed that there would be some limits on the ability of this new renewable energy to get moved around, because even now, we find that there are occasions in which the existing grid is constrained in its ability to transmit power from place to place.  When we have more decentralized, small sources of electricity - like wind generators or small boilers using trees and scrubs to make electric power -there would certainly be a need, I believe, to expand at least somewhat, the ability to connect these sources up to the grid. Because right now, the grid is really designed namely to connect large sources.  FLATOW: It looks - because from my impression, and we do lots of programs about wind, for example - it's almost like there are - every state has decided to take this on in itself. There are communities that are building, you know, hundreds of megawatts of power. We have states that are creating their own electrical systems, as oppose to being a large integrated grid these days.  Mr. TOMAN: Certainly there is a lot of movement. You see it in college campuses, communities, as you mentioned. There's a lot of this activity going on. But unfortunately, in most applications, large use of wind power is still not economic.  Direct energy cost - it's roughly competitive or even a little better than natural gas, but the big problem is that the wind doesn't blow all the time in most places. So you still have to deal with backup power to cover you when the wind is not available, and by the time you take that into account, it's still is a bit more expensive than fossil energy.  Where we see it in larger use, it's normally because states have mandated that their utility companies have a certain percentage of their power from renewable sources.  FLATOW: Talking about the 2025 project on TALK OF THE NATION Science Friday from NPR News. I'm Ira Flatow with Michael Toman of the Rand Corporation. Reducing fossil fuel use, of course, an increasing renewables will resolve in the significant reduction in carbon dioxide emissions, won't it?  Mr. TOMAN: Yes, it will. By cutting back on our use of coal, especially in the power sector because it has the most CO2 when it's burned. Also oil and natural gas. We estimate, in the sort of middle of the road case that we looked at, we could reduce emissions of CO2 in the U. S. by about 15 percent out in 2025.  That doesn't sound like a real large number. But another way to look at it is that it would take up about two-thirds of the increase in emissions that might occur between now and 2025. So this level of substitution could be a significant contribution toward, at least, slowing the growth of emissions in this country.  FLATOW: Let's go to Chuck in San Francisco. Hi, Chuck.  CHUCK (Caller): Hi. I'm wondering if your study took into account the things like trade deficit, where we buy - where if we were to develop technologies that could be produced in this country it would create jobs and we wouldn't be sending as much money overseas for old tech and for fossil fuels - and it would there by benefit us economically.  FLATOW: Yeah, will this create jobs?  Mr. TOMAN: Well, the Rand study really only looked at the electricity and fuels parts of the economy, just the energy sector, itself. The caller's question about the larger ability of these investments to reduced trade deficits and help the economy is something that gets debated very often when we're looking at issues related to oil imports and other energy questions. We did not touch on that in this work. We focused directly on the issues of direct energy costs.  FLATOW: Did - is it possible from your study to tell if we are actually on a road to 2025? The way we're heading now.  Mr. TOMAN: At this point, there has been really only modest increases in renewable energy use in the last few years. We are seeing only in the last two years, of course, significant increases in oil prices. And if fossil energy prices stay high as we see them now, we would certainly expect to see the mix of energy adjusting over the longer term.  Because coal is very plentiful, and except for greenhouse gases it can be used pretty cleanly these days, there is less likely to be a big movement toward an alternative in the power sector than there might be in the vehicle sector -where we are already seeing much more fuel efficient hybrids, for example, being sold. And certainly there is the possibility in the future, if the costs come down, of a market transition toward other sources besides gasoline.  FLATOW: Uh hm but - Mr. TOMAN: But we're really only getting started with this now, and you don't see a significant movement in that direction at this stage.  FLATOW: Is it going to take political leadership here?  Mr. TOMAN: Well, because our results indicate that we probably cannot expect these technologies to transition directly into the market, just on the basis of their relative costs - you know, head to head with their alternatives - it would require some form of policy to first make the decision that we wanted to achieve this goal, and then to figure out how to go about doing it.  So we would need leadership, first to weigh the pros and cons of doing this, and then to have, I think, a pretty complicated discussion about the ways that we would go about it.  FLATOW: I want to thank you, Michael, for taking time to talk with us.  Mr. TOMAN: It's been a great pleasure very much.

I am Ira Flatow. A bit later in the hour, a mathematical mystery. But first up, a medical mystery. A new book tells the tale of an Italian family suffering from a rare and deadly disease called fatal familial insomnia. Just like it says, it's insomnia, an illness that literally kills its victim by robbing them of the ability to sleep. They die of exhaustion. You know how you say I'm just so tired I could die. These people actually die of exhaustion. The disease is linked by the new science of prions to outbreaks of the neurological disease kuru in Papua New Guinea in the 1950s, and mad cow disease in the UK in the last decade. So we're going to start this hour by talking about the family that could not sleep and the strange protein called the prion. And if you'd like to join our discussion, our number is 1-800-989-8255, 1-800-989-TALK. D. T. Max is a science writer and the author of The Family That Couldn't Sleep: A Medical Mystery. He's written for The New York Times and the New Yorker, and he joins us today from our NPR studios in Washington. Welcome to the program. Mr. D. T. MAX (Author, The Family That Couldn't Sleep): Thanks very much. FLATOW: This sounds like a really unusual disease. They really die because they can't sleep. Mr. MAX: That's essentially right. It's a disease, fatal familial insomnia. The name sort of puts it all on the table. It's a progressive, inherited condition, characterized by eventually a total insomnia - leading within about nine months time to death. FLATOW: So you're awake - you're dying when you're awake because you can't sleep? Mr. MAX: Yeah, I think that's one way to look at it. We don't really know. One of the reasons I was drawn to this project to begin with is really the question of why we sleep. And in fact, we still don't really know why we sleep. But paradoxically, we know we have to sleep. And in the case of this family - much for the same reasons that we have this paradox I've just laid out - this family cannot sleep and they ultimately die - and therefore we believe they die from a lack of sleep. There are other causative problems. They lose the ability to regulate their autonomic systems - their sweating, and their pupils become these tiny little pinpricks. I mean many things happen to them. It's almost a kind of a plane crash of a disease, and yet they have a complete insomnia that's clearly one of the key symptoms and one of the causes of the death. FLATOW: And you say this is probably the worst disease in the world because of people suffering from it are aware they're awake, about what's happening to them. Mr. MAX: That's right. I mean I would always be reluctant to rank diseases in terms of horribleness, but I think a case certainly could be made that this disease in many ways - one, because of this insomnia - and anyone who's ever, you know, suffered insomnia knows just how dreadful a condition it is. . . FLATOW: Right, right. Mr. MAX: . . . even if the insomnia is simply worries about work tomorrow. FLATOW: Sure. Mr. MAX: You stay awake and the clock ticks and the clock ticks. But while this disease has much in common with Alzheimer's in terms of some of the things going on physiologically in the brain, what makes it quite different from Alzheimer's is that you - is that many, many of the sufferers of the disease have the ability to understand exactly what's going on. And even to be in, you know, routine verbal contact with their loved ones at the end, even though they've had this extraordinary insomnia. FLATOW: You say there are about 40 families in the world known to have this disease. Mr. MAX: Yeah, that would be a bit of a guess. We have 40 families based on the genomes that we know, and we can extrapolate from that that probably there would be maybe around 200 families worldwide. And I would emphasize that these - this disease, which is a mutation, of course - that these 200 families would all have developed the mutation probably separately. FLATOW: Hmm. And you trace - it's interesting - in the book you trace the disease through several generations of an Italian family. One of the most memorable cases was a man named Silvano. Tell us about him. Mr. MAX: Well, Silvano was a member of the family in the 1980s. And Silvano - the disease as far as I could trace it back - and I had the assistance of the family in digging through records.  In Italy, records are kept - these sorts of records are still kept in the parish houses of the churches, because the Catholic church was once responsible for recording births and deaths. And so the way they would assemble - the family would assemble information on its ancestors was, you know, you'd have to go into the church, and you'd have to ask for the records. But in Italy, records aren't really freely available. So there's a figure in the book named Ignazio - who's a young doctor who marries into the family and who - Ignazio's very much responsible for helping to solve the mystery of fatal familial insomnia. Ignazio was an organist. He was an ardent Catholic in the Italian fashion, which means that he really - as he used to love to say to me - I believe because it's absurd. (Soundbite of laughter) Mr. MAX: So Ignazio is also an avid organist and very talented. And Ignazio would go into the church and he would ask the priest could he go and, you know, play the organ. And the priest would say sure, and Ignazio would play for a little while, and then the priest would get bored and go back into the parish house. You know, in Italy, priests have really quite nice parish houses, and they have someone who looks after them, so it's kind of its own life. And then when Ignazio noticed that the priest was no longer listening, he would sneak down into the basement where the parish records were taken - were kept - and he would take photographs of anyone who had the same last name as his wife's family. So with his help, I was able to trace the disease back to the 1760s, in all probability to a doctor, fascinatingly enough, who probably - I doubt he was the first member of the family, but he might well have been. You know, it could also have gone back further. But when you get before the Napoleonic era, you pretty much lose records in Italy because of the devastation of the Napoleonic Wars. In any event, fast-forward to Silvano; we're in the 1980s. And, you know, Italy had become very rich in the period from the end of the Second World War to the 1980s, and Silvano was very much a product of the new Italy. He was a stunningly handsome man who loved to go out at night. I don't think I've ever seen a picture of Silvano not wearing a tuxedo. So this was a man who, from the way I look at things, would probably not have been well-equipped to deal with a devastating disease, just because he was, again, to my mind, a man who very much judged by exteriors. He was a very external man. But he was also the head of the family - which in Italy is a very potent post - and he had just watched two of his sisters die from this unnamed, familial disease of which clearly had an important insomnia component. So Silvano, in his heart, always knew, I think, that he would get the disease. And one thing we haven't mentioned that we should, is that the disease strikes in your 50s. So you get - one reason the disease doesn't burn itself out, the way of many severe genetic mutations, is because you live long enough to reproduce. . . FLATOW: Right. Mr. MAX: . . . so it foils that mechanism, so to say, by which most diseases are - most really virulent genetic diseases are eliminated. Silvano one day, in the Italian style, was dancing with his mother. And in Italy, you know, young bachelors are always dancing with their mothers, even today. And so he noticed he was sweating, which he knew from his experience with sisters was the first sign of the disease. And so Silvano understood what was happening. He'd always really known, I think, that he was going to get the disease. And then he went and looked in the mirror and he saw that his pupils had become these tiny pinpricks, and he knew for sure what was happening. And rather than just say, OK, I'm going to give up, I'm going to die, he really decided that he was going to throw everything he had, all of his strength, into trying to understand what was killing his family. And so he went to a neurological institute in Bologna, with the help of Ignazio - this young man who had married into the family - and he basically said to them - he sat down with a young neurologist who really just graduated from, you know, graduated shortly before and had done his neurology residency. And the neurologists will tell me, you know, what seems to be the problem? And so Silvano says - you know, this is obviously taking place in Italian - he says I know how I'm going to die. It's exactly the way that my father died and my two sisters have died, and I can give you all the details. And the neurologist was stunned, because you know, neurologists are trained in the art of euphemism. They don't really have much to offer, but they do their best. And so the neurologist said, you know, please, please, sir, you know, we have cures, we have palliatives. And Silvano said - he said, cut the nonsense, I assume when I'm gone you'll want the brain. That was Silvano. He was able to confront what was going to happen with great courage. And through the experience, through the extensive EEGs that were taken of his brain - because really nobody had done a proper EEG before on any of these people. EEGs were traditionally done in little snapshots. You know, what the family - what you needed to diagnose this family was to leave in an EEG in place for an hour, and then you would see that the brainwaves looked like nothing we had in the literature.  And you know, Silvano eventually, he died, and - but what had been learned from him, that this disease - that insomnia wasn't just a byproduct of this disease, but a key component of the disease. We really owe this to Silvano, although, you know, at that point there was still much, much left to be discovered about the disease. But it was the first step. It was the first step beyond saying we have a familial encephalitis, which was the typical diagnosis, you know. . . FLATOW: Right. Mr. MAX: Or in other eras, for instance, we had - they were believed to have Vonaconomo(ph) syndrome in the teens, when everyone had Vonaconomo syndrome. I mean they would take on. . . FLATOW: Well. . . Mr. MAX: Sorry. FLATOW: Yeah, but what you learned through this was that this was actually connected to mad cow disease, which I found, you know, quite interesting. Mr. MAX: It's extraordinarily strange. It's like having two people pop up in the same room you didn't know knew each other. It is connected to mad cow, and in fact very, very closely connected to mad cow, because in the period after Silvano's death, Ignazio kept digging and he kept finding other sufferers - cousins, second cousins, third cousins. This family had been decimated by fatal familial insomnia, and they weren't in touch in the way most Italian families are in touch. And Ignazio - again, it was his wife Leezy(ph) who was actually, you know, related to these people, was able to put together this family tree of extraordinary early death and misdiagnosis. Eventually, two other members of the family came down with the disease, and they came down with a slightly different version of the disease. And when neurologists looked at their version, they were able to see on their EEGs that their brainwaves looked rather like the brain waves of a disease called Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, or CJD. And CJD, as was known at the time - we're now in the mid-'90s - is a prion disease. It's in fact what you get when you consume infected beef and come down with the human version of mad cow disease. FLATOW: Right, right. Very interesting story, because I want to get into this whole prion connection, and what a fascinating world of medicine we're in when we talk about prions and how spooky and strange they are. And in the time we have left - we're going to go take a break - let's get back and talk about that, because as you mentioned, Jakob-Creutzfeldt disease and prion diseases, they're all connected, right? Mr. MAX: That's right. That's exactly right. FLATOW: What makes a prion different than, you know, a regular protein? Mr. MAX: Well, a prion is a protein. This is the strange thing about the prion, is - the prion is a regular protein, encoded for by a regular gene in the body, which when misformed takes on the properties of a virus and in fact takes on some properties viruses don't have, because people can just come down with prion diseases sporadically. There are in fact - and this is extremely rare but it does happen - there are people in the United States who just suddenly come down with fatal insomnia, although they don't have any other family members who have it and they wouldn't pass it on in their genes if they reproduced. FLATOW: All right. We're going to take - we'll come back and talk about how a protein - which is not a virus, it's not a bacteria, it has no DNA - how does it become infectious and carry a disease from one person to another, or one animal or some organism to another? So this is a medical mystery. We'll talk more about it with my guest, D. T. Max, author of The Family That Couldn't Sleep. Stay with us. We'll be right back after this short break. I'm Ira Flatow. This is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. (Soundbite of music) FLATOW: You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow. We're talking this hour with D. T. Max, author of The Family That Couldn't Sleep: A Medical Mystery. It's out this fall from Random House. Tell us about the prions. I gave them a big - I mean they are mysterious and strange, and we hardly know very much about them, and how do they spread diseases? Mr. MAX: I think the strangest thing in all of nature, and indeed the final proof that prions exist - we can get to that in a minute - has not really been achieved. But the basic theory of the prions goes something like this. Proteins are normally - normally assume a single state, which is to say when proteins are manufactured in the body, they're manufactured mostly as ribbons, and then they curl up, kind of like kinky hair into a form which is useful for whatever function they happen to serve in the cell. Now, most proteins can be forced into different forms if you try hard enough. Say with heat - you can deform a protein. But it will not have - it will tend to spring back to its original form to maintain its function. Now, what's odd about prions, although not unique, is that the prion - which as I say is a perfectly normal protein whose function we don't know - but given the fact that you can find prions right across mammalian and even below that in terms of development - you find prions even in certain - in frogs - it must perform some function or it would not, according to the sort of rules of evolution, have been so well-conserved across all these species. So whatever this prion does, weirdly, unusually, and I think sort of unfortunately, as it turns out, this prion can assume a second stable state, a misformed but stable state. And this - and the quality of this stable state that's so of devastating is that the prion in turn is able to cause adjoining prions to also assume the misformed state. What you get is in effect a chain reaction. One way to think about it is a little bit what happens with salt crystals, where if you - you can have a single salt crystal as the nucleation point, and then as other salt crystals precipitate, they'll form around that salt crystal - or indeed they'll also form around bits of dirt. I don't know if you've ever done this experiment in high school, if you were a high school science wizard. But this is the kind of thing kids are always doing in high school. So essentially it's a kind of a seed-crystal phenomenon, where the first misformed prion functions as a seed crystal, and then adjoining prions misform around it. Now, what's really remarkable about this fact is that it allows for infection without nucleic acid, as you point out. Now, the idea that a protein could cause an infection, for any ordinary biologist, is complete heresy. It's essentially saying that, you know, you saw a dead man walking. I mean it's just not possible. Proteins are not alive, and we all know based partially on observation and partially on sort of Darwinian theory that only living things or things with nucleic acid are interested or have reason to create infections, because infection is a way for a virus or a bacteria to replicate. Well, the prion has no reason to replicate because it's not alive, and yet it too can form, as the theory goes, it too can cause an infection. So for instance, in mad cow disease you have an infected cow, you eat some of that beef, some of the infectious-formed prions go into your digestive system. Eventually, through ways we don't really understand, they work their way up to your brain, where they begin to convert adjoining prions into the infectious form. Unfortunately, infectious prions are not really very useful for bodily functions. In fact, for reasons, again, we don't quite understand, they inhibit or destroy them, and as a result, you get a disease. But you - but at no point do you have a nucleic acid. FLATOW: Right. Mr. MAX: At no point do you have replication through nucleic acid. FLATOW: And what's also fascinating about these prions is how indestructible they are. Mr. MAX: They are really extraordinary. A prion - the only really reliable way to kill a prion is with bleach. You can't kill it with heat. You can't kill it with radiation. Formalin actually makes prions more virulent. I once went to - well, there's a domestic prion disease in the wild in the United States called chronic wasting disease that affects deer and elk. And I once went to one of these stations where they were hauling in deer during a shooting season in Wisconsin, attempting to kind of limit the damage that these - you know, that this spread of this chronic waste disease in the wild was extraordinary. And they were trying to kill some of the carriers - which turned out to be a fruitless effort, but it was fun for a lot of the hunters because they removed the limits on the number of deer that they. . . FLATOW: The hunt? Mr. MAX: Yeah, so they would - but - so they would bring in, you know, dozens of deer. And anyway, they - what was going on was so strange. And nobody could really understand the risks, but every so often - and the place stank. It was an open-air trailer out in the woods, and you could smell it for miles away, and there were all these deer. I mean it felt like nature was out of control. There were these deer with their tongues hanging out after they had had their heads cut off, and the bodies were being thrown away, because even though the hunters could take the body home, subject to some sort of protein analysis to see if the deer had been infected, no one wanted to. And anyway, they would - every so often this guy, you know, in a hat that said Chronic Wasting Disease Response Team would come by and splash this extraordinarily harsh bleach over everything. And I thought to myself, this is what it takes. I mean this is, you know - you can't use any other method. You can't use any conventional antibacterial or antiviral method to control this disease. And I think that's why, although prion diseases are quite rare, ordinarily, they have the ability to kind of swell up in these incredible epidemics and epizootics. I think you see that with mad cow disease in England, where I think 800,000 cattle had to be destroyed or died from mad cow disease, and then 150 humans to date have gotten it from - probably from consuming the infected beef. FLATOW: Hmm. And so how did you get the connection, or how did they connect the familial insomnia - that it was, you know, to a prion, that it was a prion? Mr. MAX: Well, basically the way they did it essentially was, okay, they had the information from the brainwaves, which was to say that Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, CJD, as it's more often called, had a very similar EEG signature to the familial disease of this Italian family. And then, you know, at this point we're in the 1990s, and some very good scientists - among them Stanley Prusiner, who the Nobel Prize in 1997 - had been able to find the gene for the healthy prion. You know, it was an ordinary gene. They had found it. Using the technology of the time, it was possible to find the genes. And then they were fairly, in short order, fairly able to find the mutation on the gene which corresponded to fatal familial insomnia. So after this 200-year-long mystery, the disease, you know, took its place as one of a number of inherited prion diseases, because prions can also, you know, as I say, prions - we've talked about infection, we've talked about them occurring sporadically, but of course they also can be passed on. Now, what's particularly devastating about the inherited form of the disease is, of course, that the prions misform on a vast scale in the body probably more or less simultaneously when you reach a certain age. So it's a far - it's a sense a farm harsher - again, I hate to rank diseases, but the prion diseases, the inherited form, is the most - I think the harshest, the most destructive and overwhelming. FLATOW: So are you a believer in the prion idea? Mr. MAX: Well, that's a very relevant question, because it does almost become kind of like - when you get into this world - you know, and I spent about four or five years working on this book - you really are asked whether you're, you know, dry or wet. Everybody's got a strong opinion, and then there's a kind of middle group who are agnostic, who do the work on prions because they know that the protein must be important in the disease, without absolutely knowing that the protein is, you know, is the disease. I would say, you know - and as a writer, as a journalist, you're not in there doing the experiments. You know, you're able to read the papers. You're able to look at the protein gels as they're reproduced, you know, usually fairly poorly in the off-prints that you get a hold of. So I believe that the science is pretty sound. I would be more - I would be more far more surprised to find that prions were aided by some sort of quasi-nucleic acid not yet found, not yet understood, than that in fact the theory, you know, probably with some slight, slight fiddling on the edges for just why this happens, you know, some slight adjustment to allow for the fact that it just seems a little bit kind of out of the blue - I would think that would be far more likely. And in fact, we've even - researchers have even found another disease which spreads the same way. One of the amyloidoses, one of the infectious amyloidoses, can actually be injected into mice and cause amyloidoses. So prions are not absolutely alone in having this ability. You know, and the amyloidoses, again, would not be - would be a disease without a nucleic acid. FLATOW: Right. I have one question left for you before we have to say goodbye, and that is what about this Italian family? What is happening with them? Mr. MAX: Well, I think - you know, I think for them, as I try to draw out in the book, the process of coming to terms with this disease has been a long-term one, beginning really with Silvano in the '80s and then going through the '90s when they got a name for the disease and a genetic test, and into the zero-zeroes or whatever decade we're in. The family has now joined forces with a very sophisticated group in Milan, a proteomics group - really the foremost organization of its sort in Milan - and interestingly, although there are right now a couple of cures - I shouldn't say cures - there are a couple of palliatives that seem to work fairly well for prion diseases, the best known one being Pentosan, which is actually an ordinary drug that's usually given for bladder infection but which has shown great promise in a young man who got the infectious form of mad cow disease from eating infected beef and lives in Belfast who's now been alive for four or five years with a prion infection. The family didn't choose to go that way. For one thing, these drugs usually have very strong side effects. In the cast of Pentosan, you need a shunt placed in your brain because the drug is too big to get through the blood brain/barrier. And I don't know if it's because they're Italian or because they're just making a good decision or because they are closer to this Milan group, but they've chosen instead to sort of give themselves to some very basic research on what causes prion infections, you know, without, let's say, looking for a quick fix. And a quick fix is very much on their minds because, you know, if the disease routinely strikes in your 40s or 50s, there are a number of members of the families now in their 30s and 40s that must surely be getting up and looking in the mirror and saying, you know, do I look different today? FLATOW: Fascinating story, D. T. I want to thank you for taking time to talk about it. Mr. MAX: Thank you. FLATOW: And I wish you good luck. Mr. MAX: Thanks. FLATOW: D. T. Max, author of very interesting book, The Family That Couldn't Sleep. D. T. Max. I highly recommend it. Thanks again. He's a science writer in Alexandria, Virginia.  IRA FLATOW, host:  This is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I am Ira Flatow.  A bit later in the hour, a mathematical mystery. But first up, a medical mystery. A new book tells the tale of an Italian family suffering from a rare and deadly disease called fatal familial insomnia. Just like it says, it's insomnia, an illness that literally kills its victim by robbing them of the ability to sleep. They die of exhaustion. You know how you say I'm just so tired I could die. These people actually die of exhaustion.  The disease is linked by the new science of prions to outbreaks of the neurological disease kuru in Papua New Guinea in the 1950s, and mad cow disease in the UK in the last decade. So we're going to start this hour by talking about the family that could not sleep and the strange protein called the prion. And if you'd like to join our discussion, our number is 1-800-989-8255, 1-800-989-TALK.  D. T. Max is a science writer and the author of The Family That Couldn't Sleep: A Medical Mystery. He's written for The New York Times and the New Yorker, and he joins us today from our NPR studios in Washington. Welcome to the program.  Mr. D. T. MAX (Author, The Family That Couldn't Sleep): Thanks very much.  FLATOW: This sounds like a really unusual disease. They really die because they can't sleep.  Mr. MAX: That's essentially right. It's a disease, fatal familial insomnia. The name sort of puts it all on the table. It's a progressive, inherited condition, characterized by eventually a total insomnia - leading within about nine months time to death.  FLATOW: So you're awake - you're dying when you're awake because you can't sleep?  Mr. MAX: Yeah, I think that's one way to look at it. We don't really know. One of the reasons I was drawn to this project to begin with is really the question of why we sleep. And in fact, we still don't really know why we sleep. But paradoxically, we know we have to sleep.  And in the case of this family - much for the same reasons that we have this paradox I've just laid out - this family cannot sleep and they ultimately die - and therefore we believe they die from a lack of sleep. There are other causative problems. They lose the ability to regulate their autonomic systems - their sweating, and their pupils become these tiny little pinpricks. I mean many things happen to them. It's almost a kind of a plane crash of a disease, and yet they have a complete insomnia that's clearly one of the key symptoms and one of the causes of the death.  FLATOW: And you say this is probably the worst disease in the world because of people suffering from it are aware they're awake, about what's happening to them.  Mr. MAX: That's right. I mean I would always be reluctant to rank diseases in terms of horribleness, but I think a case certainly could be made that this disease in many ways - one, because of this insomnia - and anyone who's ever, you know, suffered insomnia knows just how dreadful a condition it is. . .  FLATOW: Right, right.  Mr. MAX: . . . even if the insomnia is simply worries about work tomorrow.  FLATOW: Sure.  Mr. MAX: You stay awake and the clock ticks and the clock ticks. But while this disease has much in common with Alzheimer's in terms of some of the things going on physiologically in the brain, what makes it quite different from Alzheimer's is that you - is that many, many of the sufferers of the disease have the ability to understand exactly what's going on. And even to be in, you know, routine verbal contact with their loved ones at the end, even though they've had this extraordinary insomnia.  FLATOW: You say there are about 40 families in the world known to have this disease.  Mr. MAX: Yeah, that would be a bit of a guess. We have 40 families based on the genomes that we know, and we can extrapolate from that that probably there would be maybe around 200 families worldwide. And I would emphasize that these - this disease, which is a mutation, of course - that these 200 families would all have developed the mutation probably separately.  FLATOW: Hmm. And you trace - it's interesting - in the book you trace the disease through several generations of an Italian family. One of the most memorable cases was a man named Silvano. Tell us about him.  Mr. MAX: Well, Silvano was a member of the family in the 1980s. And Silvano - the disease as far as I could trace it back - and I had the assistance of the family in digging through records.   In Italy, records are kept - these sorts of records are still kept in the parish houses of the churches, because the Catholic church was once responsible for recording births and deaths. And so the way they would assemble - the family would assemble information on its ancestors was, you know, you'd have to go into the church, and you'd have to ask for the records. But in Italy, records aren't really freely available. So there's a figure in the book named Ignazio - who's a young doctor who marries into the family and who - Ignazio's very much responsible for helping to solve the mystery of fatal familial insomnia.  Ignazio was an organist. He was an ardent Catholic in the Italian fashion, which means that he really - as he used to love to say to me - I believe because it's absurd.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Mr. MAX: So Ignazio is also an avid organist and very talented. And Ignazio would go into the church and he would ask the priest could he go and, you know, play the organ. And the priest would say sure, and Ignazio would play for a little while, and then the priest would get bored and go back into the parish house. You know, in Italy, priests have really quite nice parish houses, and they have someone who looks after them, so it's kind of its own life.  And then when Ignazio noticed that the priest was no longer listening, he would sneak down into the basement where the parish records were taken - were kept - and he would take photographs of anyone who had the same last name as his wife's family.  So with his help, I was able to trace the disease back to the 1760s, in all probability to a doctor, fascinatingly enough, who probably - I doubt he was the first member of the family, but he might well have been. You know, it could also have gone back further. But when you get before the Napoleonic era, you pretty much lose records in Italy because of the devastation of the Napoleonic Wars.  In any event, fast-forward to Silvano; we're in the 1980s. And, you know, Italy had become very rich in the period from the end of the Second World War to the 1980s, and Silvano was very much a product of the new Italy. He was a stunningly handsome man who loved to go out at night. I don't think I've ever seen a picture of Silvano not wearing a tuxedo.  So this was a man who, from the way I look at things, would probably not have been well-equipped to deal with a devastating disease, just because he was, again, to my mind, a man who very much judged by exteriors. He was a very external man. But he was also the head of the family - which in Italy is a very potent post - and he had just watched two of his sisters die from this unnamed, familial disease of which clearly had an important insomnia component.  So Silvano, in his heart, always knew, I think, that he would get the disease. And one thing we haven't mentioned that we should, is that the disease strikes in your 50s. So you get - one reason the disease doesn't burn itself out, the way of many severe genetic mutations, is because you live long enough to reproduce. . .  FLATOW: Right.  Mr. MAX: . . . so it foils that mechanism, so to say, by which most diseases are - most really virulent genetic diseases are eliminated.  Silvano one day, in the Italian style, was dancing with his mother. And in Italy, you know, young bachelors are always dancing with their mothers, even today. And so he noticed he was sweating, which he knew from his experience with sisters was the first sign of the disease. And so Silvano understood what was happening. He'd always really known, I think, that he was going to get the disease. And then he went and looked in the mirror and he saw that his pupils had become these tiny pinpricks, and he knew for sure what was happening.  And rather than just say, OK, I'm going to give up, I'm going to die, he really decided that he was going to throw everything he had, all of his strength, into trying to understand what was killing his family. And so he went to a neurological institute in Bologna, with the help of Ignazio - this young man who had married into the family - and he basically said to them - he sat down with a young neurologist who really just graduated from, you know, graduated shortly before and had done his neurology residency.  And the neurologists will tell me, you know, what seems to be the problem? And so Silvano says - you know, this is obviously taking place in Italian - he says I know how I'm going to die. It's exactly the way that my father died and my two sisters have died, and I can give you all the details.  And the neurologist was stunned, because you know, neurologists are trained in the art of euphemism. They don't really have much to offer, but they do their best. And so the neurologist said, you know, please, please, sir, you know, we have cures, we have palliatives. And Silvano said - he said, cut the nonsense, I assume when I'm gone you'll want the brain. That was Silvano. He was able to confront what was going to happen with great courage. And through the experience, through the extensive EEGs that were taken of his brain - because really nobody had done a proper EEG before on any of these people. EEGs were traditionally done in little snapshots. You know, what the family - what you needed to diagnose this family was to leave in an EEG in place for an hour, and then you would see that the brainwaves looked like nothing we had in the literature.   And you know, Silvano eventually, he died, and - but what had been learned from him, that this disease - that insomnia wasn't just a byproduct of this disease, but a key component of the disease. We really owe this to Silvano, although, you know, at that point there was still much, much left to be discovered about the disease. But it was the first step. It was the first step beyond saying we have a familial encephalitis, which was the typical diagnosis, you know. . .  FLATOW: Right.  Mr. MAX: Or in other eras, for instance, we had - they were believed to have Vonaconomo(ph) syndrome in the teens, when everyone had Vonaconomo syndrome. I mean they would take on. . .  FLATOW: Well. . .  Mr. MAX: Sorry.  FLATOW: Yeah, but what you learned through this was that this was actually connected to mad cow disease, which I found, you know, quite interesting.  Mr. MAX: It's extraordinarily strange. It's like having two people pop up in the same room you didn't know knew each other. It is connected to mad cow, and in fact very, very closely connected to mad cow, because in the period after Silvano's death, Ignazio kept digging and he kept finding other sufferers - cousins, second cousins, third cousins.  This family had been decimated by fatal familial insomnia, and they weren't in touch in the way most Italian families are in touch. And Ignazio - again, it was his wife Leezy(ph) who was actually, you know, related to these people, was able to put together this family tree of extraordinary early death and misdiagnosis.  Eventually, two other members of the family came down with the disease, and they came down with a slightly different version of the disease. And when neurologists looked at their version, they were able to see on their EEGs that their brainwaves looked rather like the brain waves of a disease called Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, or CJD. And CJD, as was known at the time - we're now in the mid-'90s - is a prion disease. It's in fact what you get when you consume infected beef and come down with the human version of mad cow disease.  FLATOW: Right, right. Very interesting story, because I want to get into this whole prion connection, and what a fascinating world of medicine we're in when we talk about prions and how spooky and strange they are. And in the time we have left - we're going to go take a break - let's get back and talk about that, because as you mentioned, Jakob-Creutzfeldt disease and prion diseases, they're all connected, right?  Mr. MAX: That's right. That's exactly right.  FLATOW: What makes a prion different than, you know, a regular protein?  Mr. MAX: Well, a prion is a protein. This is the strange thing about the prion, is - the prion is a regular protein, encoded for by a regular gene in the body, which when misformed takes on the properties of a virus and in fact takes on some properties viruses don't have, because people can just come down with prion diseases sporadically.  There are in fact - and this is extremely rare but it does happen - there are people in the United States who just suddenly come down with fatal insomnia, although they don't have any other family members who have it and they wouldn't pass it on in their genes if they reproduced.  FLATOW: All right. We're going to take - we'll come back and talk about how a protein - which is not a virus, it's not a bacteria, it has no DNA - how does it become infectious and carry a disease from one person to another, or one animal or some organism to another? So this is a medical mystery. We'll talk more about it with my guest, D. T. Max, author of The Family That Couldn't Sleep. Stay with us. We'll be right back after this short break.  I'm Ira Flatow. This is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.  (Soundbite of music)  FLATOW: You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow. We're talking this hour with D. T. Max, author of The Family That Couldn't Sleep: A Medical Mystery. It's out this fall from Random House.  Tell us about the prions. I gave them a big - I mean they are mysterious and strange, and we hardly know very much about them, and how do they spread diseases?  Mr. MAX: I think the strangest thing in all of nature, and indeed the final proof that prions exist - we can get to that in a minute - has not really been achieved. But the basic theory of the prions goes something like this. Proteins are normally - normally assume a single state, which is to say when proteins are manufactured in the body, they're manufactured mostly as ribbons, and then they curl up, kind of like kinky hair into a form which is useful for whatever function they happen to serve in the cell.  Now, most proteins can be forced into different forms if you try hard enough. Say with heat - you can deform a protein. But it will not have - it will tend to spring back to its original form to maintain its function.  Now, what's odd about prions, although not unique, is that the prion - which as I say is a perfectly normal protein whose function we don't know - but given the fact that you can find prions right across mammalian and even below that in terms of development - you find prions even in certain - in frogs - it must perform some function or it would not, according to the sort of rules of evolution, have been so well-conserved across all these species.  So whatever this prion does, weirdly, unusually, and I think sort of unfortunately, as it turns out, this prion can assume a second stable state, a misformed but stable state. And this - and the quality of this stable state that's so of devastating is that the prion in turn is able to cause adjoining prions to also assume the misformed state. What you get is in effect a chain reaction.  One way to think about it is a little bit what happens with salt crystals, where if you - you can have a single salt crystal as the nucleation point, and then as other salt crystals precipitate, they'll form around that salt crystal - or indeed they'll also form around bits of dirt. I don't know if you've ever done this experiment in high school, if you were a high school science wizard. But this is the kind of thing kids are always doing in high school.  So essentially it's a kind of a seed-crystal phenomenon, where the first misformed prion functions as a seed crystal, and then adjoining prions misform around it.  Now, what's really remarkable about this fact is that it allows for infection without nucleic acid, as you point out. Now, the idea that a protein could cause an infection, for any ordinary biologist, is complete heresy. It's essentially saying that, you know, you saw a dead man walking. I mean it's just not possible. Proteins are not alive, and we all know based partially on observation and partially on sort of Darwinian theory that only living things or things with nucleic acid are interested or have reason to create infections, because infection is a way for a virus or a bacteria to replicate.  Well, the prion has no reason to replicate because it's not alive, and yet it too can form, as the theory goes, it too can cause an infection. So for instance, in mad cow disease you have an infected cow, you eat some of that beef, some of the infectious-formed prions go into your digestive system. Eventually, through ways we don't really understand, they work their way up to your brain, where they begin to convert adjoining prions into the infectious form.  Unfortunately, infectious prions are not really very useful for bodily functions. In fact, for reasons, again, we don't quite understand, they inhibit or destroy them, and as a result, you get a disease. But you - but at no point do you have a nucleic acid.  FLATOW: Right.  Mr. MAX: At no point do you have replication through nucleic acid.  FLATOW: And what's also fascinating about these prions is how indestructible they are.  Mr. MAX: They are really extraordinary. A prion - the only really reliable way to kill a prion is with bleach. You can't kill it with heat. You can't kill it with radiation. Formalin actually makes prions more virulent.  I once went to - well, there's a domestic prion disease in the wild in the United States called chronic wasting disease that affects deer and elk. And I once went to one of these stations where they were hauling in deer during a shooting season in Wisconsin, attempting to kind of limit the damage that these - you know, that this spread of this chronic waste disease in the wild was extraordinary. And they were trying to kill some of the carriers - which turned out to be a fruitless effort, but it was fun for a lot of the hunters because they removed the limits on the number of deer that they. . .  FLATOW: The hunt?  Mr. MAX: Yeah, so they would - but - so they would bring in, you know, dozens of deer. And anyway, they - what was going on was so strange. And nobody could really understand the risks, but every so often - and the place stank. It was an open-air trailer out in the woods, and you could smell it for miles away, and there were all these deer. I mean it felt like nature was out of control. There were these deer with their tongues hanging out after they had had their heads cut off, and the bodies were being thrown away, because even though the hunters could take the body home, subject to some sort of protein analysis to see if the deer had been infected, no one wanted to.  And anyway, they would - every so often this guy, you know, in a hat that said Chronic Wasting Disease Response Team would come by and splash this extraordinarily harsh bleach over everything. And I thought to myself, this is what it takes. I mean this is, you know - you can't use any other method. You can't use any conventional antibacterial or antiviral method to control this disease.  And I think that's why, although prion diseases are quite rare, ordinarily, they have the ability to kind of swell up in these incredible epidemics and epizootics. I think you see that with mad cow disease in England, where I think 800,000 cattle had to be destroyed or died from mad cow disease, and then 150 humans to date have gotten it from - probably from consuming the infected beef.  FLATOW: Hmm. And so how did you get the connection, or how did they connect the familial insomnia - that it was, you know, to a prion, that it was a prion?  Mr. MAX: Well, basically the way they did it essentially was, okay, they had the information from the brainwaves, which was to say that Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, CJD, as it's more often called, had a very similar EEG signature to the familial disease of this Italian family.  And then, you know, at this point we're in the 1990s, and some very good scientists - among them Stanley Prusiner, who the Nobel Prize in 1997 - had been able to find the gene for the healthy prion. You know, it was an ordinary gene. They had found it. Using the technology of the time, it was possible to find the genes. And then they were fairly, in short order, fairly able to find the mutation on the gene which corresponded to fatal familial insomnia.  So after this 200-year-long mystery, the disease, you know, took its place as one of a number of inherited prion diseases, because prions can also, you know, as I say, prions - we've talked about infection, we've talked about them occurring sporadically, but of course they also can be passed on.  Now, what's particularly devastating about the inherited form of the disease is, of course, that the prions misform on a vast scale in the body probably more or less simultaneously when you reach a certain age. So it's a far - it's a sense a farm harsher - again, I hate to rank diseases, but the prion diseases, the inherited form, is the most - I think the harshest, the most destructive and overwhelming.  FLATOW: So are you a believer in the prion idea?  Mr. MAX: Well, that's a very relevant question, because it does almost become kind of like - when you get into this world - you know, and I spent about four or five years working on this book - you really are asked whether you're, you know, dry or wet. Everybody's got a strong opinion, and then there's a kind of middle group who are agnostic, who do the work on prions because they know that the protein must be important in the disease, without absolutely knowing that the protein is, you know, is the disease.  I would say, you know - and as a writer, as a journalist, you're not in there doing the experiments. You know, you're able to read the papers. You're able to look at the protein gels as they're reproduced, you know, usually fairly poorly in the off-prints that you get a hold of. So I believe that the science is pretty sound. I would be more - I would be more far more surprised to find that prions were aided by some sort of quasi-nucleic acid not yet found, not yet understood, than that in fact the theory, you know, probably with some slight, slight fiddling on the edges for just why this happens, you know, some slight adjustment to allow for the fact that it just seems a little bit kind of out of the blue - I would think that would be far more likely.  And in fact, we've even - researchers have even found another disease which spreads the same way. One of the amyloidoses, one of the infectious amyloidoses, can actually be injected into mice and cause amyloidoses. So prions are not absolutely alone in having this ability. You know, and the amyloidoses, again, would not be - would be a disease without a nucleic acid.  FLATOW: Right. I have one question left for you before we have to say goodbye, and that is what about this Italian family? What is happening with them?  Mr. MAX: Well, I think - you know, I think for them, as I try to draw out in the book, the process of coming to terms with this disease has been a long-term one, beginning really with Silvano in the '80s and then going through the '90s when they got a name for the disease and a genetic test, and into the zero-zeroes or whatever decade we're in.  The family has now joined forces with a very sophisticated group in Milan, a proteomics group - really the foremost organization of its sort in Milan - and interestingly, although there are right now a couple of cures - I shouldn't say cures - there are a couple of palliatives that seem to work fairly well for prion diseases, the best known one being Pentosan, which is actually an ordinary drug that's usually given for bladder infection but which has shown great promise in a young man who got the infectious form of mad cow disease from eating infected beef and lives in Belfast who's now been alive for four or five years with a prion infection.  The family didn't choose to go that way. For one thing, these drugs usually have very strong side effects. In the cast of Pentosan, you need a shunt placed in your brain because the drug is too big to get through the blood brain/barrier. And I don't know if it's because they're Italian or because they're just making a good decision or because they are closer to this Milan group, but they've chosen instead to sort of give themselves to some very basic research on what causes prion infections, you know, without, let's say, looking for a quick fix.  And a quick fix is very much on their minds because, you know, if the disease routinely strikes in your 40s or 50s, there are a number of members of the families now in their 30s and 40s that must surely be getting up and looking in the mirror and saying, you know, do I look different today?  FLATOW: Fascinating story, D. T. I want to thank you for taking time to talk about it.  Mr. MAX: Thank you.  FLATOW: And I wish you good luck.  Mr. MAX: Thanks.  FLATOW: D. T.

S. and Vietnam has come a long way since the fall of Saigon in 1975. Thirty-one years after the end of a war that left as many as three million Vietnamese and 58,000 Americans dead, U. S. warships now make port calls in Ho Chi Minh City and DaNang. American businesspeople are surging into the country. Passage of the U. S. -Vietnam trade bill, delayed earlier this week but still expected to approval, will bring even more. One of the last outstanding issues between the two countries, though, is the damage done by the chemical defoliant Agent Orange. NPR's Michael Sullivan is based in Vietnam and joins us now from Hanoi. Michael, thanks for being with us. MICHAEL SULLIVAN: Hi, Scott. SIMON: And remind us, please, about what Agent Orange is and was used for during the war. SULLIVAN: Well, as you said, it's a chemical defoliant that got its name from the orange identification stripes painted on the 55-gallon drums that it used to come in. The U. S. sprayed about 12 million gallons of this stuff in Vietnam from 1962 to 1971, almost all of it in the south, in an effort to deny the enemy cover there. And it's the dioxin that was in that chemical compound that's causing the problems. The Vietnamese say there are about a million Agent Orange victims - people with birth defects or cancer or other health problems, problems the Vietnamese say are caused by dioxin in the food chain, in the water or in the soil. And the Vietnamese say these aren't just cases left over from the war, that there's a whole new generation who are now victims born to parents exposed to dioxin or newly exposed themselves. The Vietnamese say the Americans sprayed the stuff, they should be responsible for making things right. And making it right for many Vietnamese means providing compensation. The U. S. says there's not enough definitive proof that Agent Orange, the dioxin in it, has caused all these birth defects and all these other health problems in all these people that the Vietnamese claim it has. SIMON: Now, U. S. veterans have received compensation for the exposure to Agent Orange, haven't they? SULLIVAN: Yeah. And this is, you know, to the Vietnamese, obviously, this is a little frustrating, because in the early '90s Congress okayed financial help for U. S. veteran. And in the late '70s a group of vets filed suit against the U. S. manufacturers of Agent Orange and settled out of court, in 1984, I think, for about $180 million. So three Vietnamese filed a similar suit against the manufacturers two years ago in federal court in Brooklyn, but that effort failed. They've appealed, and the appeal is expected to be heard in a few months. SIMON: Do Vietnamese citizens who have been injured or believe they have been injured by Agent Orange get any compensation from their own government? SULLIVAN: They do, but it's not a lot. About $20 a month in compensation. The Vietnamese also haven't done a great deal in the way of environmental clean-up, so there are probably contaminated sites out there that people don't know about and being exposed to. But I think that's going to change in the future. Because last week the Ford Foundation announced a new $2. 2 million grant to help identify dioxin hotspots, and some new government-to-government cooperation between the U. S. and Vietnam on the environmental side as well. SIMON: What form is that cooperation taking? SULLIVAN: Researchers have identified several hotspots where Agent Orange was stored. And one of those places is DaNang, at the old U. S. airbase there. And last year the U. S. and Vietnamese governments got together on a project to test the soil there, and now the two countries are working together on a plan to remove the dioxin from the soil. It's going to be expensive and the U. S. is going to foot part of the bill. So this is clearly an example of the two countries moving forward, and the Vietnamese say as much. SIMON: Should we expect any progress on the Agent Orange issue at this summit meeting? SULLIVAN: It's hard to tell. I mean there was a joint statement yesterday. President Bush and Vietnam's President Triet agreed that further joint efforts, like the one I was just talking about, to address environmental contamination, are needed. So that's encouraging. Some here have hinted that President Bush might say more before he leaves. But we don't know. SIMON: NPR's Michael Sullivan in Hanoi. Thanks very much. SULLIVAN: You're welcome, Scott.  SCOTT SIMON, host:   President Bush's very presence demonstrates that the relationship between the U. S. and Vietnam has come a long way since the fall of Saigon in 1975. Thirty-one years after the end of a war that left as many as three million Vietnamese and 58,000 Americans dead, U. S. warships now make port calls in Ho Chi Minh City and DaNang. American businesspeople are surging into the country. Passage of the U. S. -Vietnam trade bill, delayed earlier this week but still expected to approval, will bring even more.  One of the last outstanding issues between the two countries, though, is the damage done by the chemical defoliant Agent Orange. NPR's Michael Sullivan is based in Vietnam and joins us now from Hanoi. Michael, thanks for being with us.  MICHAEL SULLIVAN: Hi, Scott.  SIMON: And remind us, please, about what Agent Orange is and was used for during the war.  SULLIVAN: Well, as you said, it's a chemical defoliant that got its name from the orange identification stripes painted on the 55-gallon drums that it used to come in. The U. S. sprayed about 12 million gallons of this stuff in Vietnam from 1962 to 1971, almost all of it in the south, in an effort to deny the enemy cover there. And it's the dioxin that was in that chemical compound that's causing the problems.  The Vietnamese say there are about a million Agent Orange victims - people with birth defects or cancer or other health problems, problems the Vietnamese say are caused by dioxin in the food chain, in the water or in the soil. And the Vietnamese say these aren't just cases left over from the war, that there's a whole new generation who are now victims born to parents exposed to dioxin or newly exposed themselves.  The Vietnamese say the Americans sprayed the stuff, they should be responsible for making things right. And making it right for many Vietnamese means providing compensation. The U. S. says there's not enough definitive proof that Agent Orange, the dioxin in it, has caused all these birth defects and all these other health problems in all these people that the Vietnamese claim it has.  SIMON: Now, U. S. veterans have received compensation for the exposure to Agent Orange, haven't they?  SULLIVAN: Yeah. And this is, you know, to the Vietnamese, obviously, this is a little frustrating, because in the early '90s Congress okayed financial help for U. S. veteran. And in the late '70s a group of vets filed suit against the U. S. manufacturers of Agent Orange and settled out of court, in 1984, I think, for about $180 million.  So three Vietnamese filed a similar suit against the manufacturers two years ago in federal court in Brooklyn, but that effort failed. They've appealed, and the appeal is expected to be heard in a few months.  SIMON: Do Vietnamese citizens who have been injured or believe they have been injured by Agent Orange get any compensation from their own government?  SULLIVAN: They do, but it's not a lot. About $20 a month in compensation. The Vietnamese also haven't done a great deal in the way of environmental clean-up, so there are probably contaminated sites out there that people don't know about and being exposed to. But I think that's going to change in the future.  Because last week the Ford Foundation announced a new $2. 2 million grant to help identify dioxin hotspots, and some new government-to-government cooperation between the U. S. and Vietnam on the environmental side as well.  SIMON: What form is that cooperation taking?  SULLIVAN: Researchers have identified several hotspots where Agent Orange was stored. And one of those places is DaNang, at the old U. S. airbase there. And last year the U. S. and Vietnamese governments got together on a project to test the soil there, and now the two countries are working together on a plan to remove the dioxin from the soil. It's going to be expensive and the U. S. is going to foot part of the bill.  So this is clearly an example of the two countries moving forward, and the Vietnamese say as much.  SIMON: Should we expect any progress on the Agent Orange issue at this summit meeting?  SULLIVAN: It's hard to tell. I mean there was a joint statement yesterday. President Bush and Vietnam's President Triet agreed that further joint efforts, like the one I was just talking about, to address environmental contamination, are needed. So that's encouraging.  Some here have hinted that President Bush might say more before he leaves. But we don't know.  SIMON: NPR's Michael Sullivan in Hanoi. Thanks very much.  SULLIVAN: You're welcome, Scott.

Joining me now is Joan Scott. Ms. Scott is a certified genetic counselor and the deputy director of the Genetics and Public Policy Center. Good morning. Ms. JOAN SCOTT (Genetics and Public Policy Center): Good morning. SEABROOK: You've just heard the same story our listeners have. Can you give us an idea of how this interbreeding can cause such extensive genetic problems? Ms. SCOTT: Well, when individuals marry relatives, they're at a higher risk for having children with genetic disorders. And there's a particular category of genetic disorders that they're at higher risk for, and those are what we call in recessively inherited disorders. So our genes come in pairs. We get one copy from mom and one copy from dad. That's what makes us an equal 50/50 product of our parents. In recessive disorders, both copies of that pair have to be abnormal in order to be infected. So both parents have to be affected. SEABROOK: So you can have one. . . Ms. SCOTT: And be perfectly fine. SEABROOK: Okay. Ms. SCOTT: And it isn't unless, until you have a child with someone who's a carrier for the very same recessive disorder that you are that you're at risk to have a child with a double dose and to be affected. SEABROOK: So in essence, the bad genes, the genes that are responsible for, you know, physical problems, mental problems and so on, get more concentrated over the generations? Ms. SCOTT: That's right. If you had a child with just someone in the general population, the chances that the two of you would carry the very same recessive gene is pretty low. But when you marry a relative, the probability that you're both carrying the same recessive gene is much higher, and so you're in a much higher risk to have a child with a recessive disorder. And this is, you know, particularly so in those communities where there's been lots of intermarrying. So it's not like you're just first cousins. You're probably first cousins several different ways, because, you know, your families have been intermarrying and related to each other in a number of ways. The other thing that could be going on is when you have small communities that are sort of isolated, you can get concentrations of some deleterious genes in that community that might be pretty rare in the general population, but they get concentrated in that community. SEABROOK: One family in the story had three healthy children and four children with serious problems. How does that happen? Ms. SCOTT: Well, even if you, both you and your partner are carriers for the same recessive disorder, there is a one in four chance that that double dose will come together and the child be affected. But there is also a 75 percent chance that it won't happen. So even in families where you are, you know, related to each other and both members are carriers, there's still a chance to have perfectly normal children. SEABROOK: What options do these children have if they grow up and have relatively normal lives, if they continue to intermarry? It sounds like, that it may only get worse for them. What if they go outside of their villages? Ms. SCOTT: Yeah. I think any kind of solution has to take into account the social, the economic, the cultural realities of the situation that the couple lives in. Having children by someone whom you're not related would obviously lower that risk. If the specific disorder is known, it might be possible to do carrier testing and determine for sure if your partner carries the same recessive disorder that you do. And if you don't, then you know you're not at risk to have a child affected. And if you do, then you sort of know what your risks may be, and then you can decide what you want to do about that. SEABROOK: Some of those options may not be available to people in a small village in Syria, but we should also say that this is not something that only happens in a small village in Syria. This happens all over the world. Ms. SCOTT: That's right. There are parts of the - around the world where marrying relatives is not uncommon for a variety of reasons. So it's not all that unusual. SEABROOK: So it really is the generations of this happening that concentrates the risks. Ms. SCOTT: And you get this concentrated of these genes sort of concentrating in these particular populations, where the risk really becomes much higher. SEABROOK: Very interesting. Joan Scott is a certified genetic counselor and the deputy director of the Genetics and Public Policy Institute in Washington. Thank you very much. Ms. SCOTT: Thank you.

I'm Andrea Seabrook. Deep in the countryside of northern Syria lies a tiny village with a very big problem. For more than a century it's been common practice in Kesten for its 5,000 residents to intermarry. The tradition of marriage between first cousins is widespread in the Arab world, seen as a way to keep property and businesses in the family. But intermarriage is also inherently risky. As many as 800 children in this impoverished village are living with extreme genetic defects. Kristen Gillespie reports. (Soundbite of footsteps) KRISTEN GILLESPIE: As Malek Mahmo walks along the narrow, unpaved streets of his village, he points to house after house where families have children with major genetic abnormalities. Mr. MALECK MAHMO (Schoolteacher): (Through translator) These children are like forgotten stones. The sun passes everyday and their lives don't change. No education and only some basic care from their families. Otherwise, it's as if they don't even exist. GILLESPIE: At the edge of the village, Malek pays a visit to one family with seven children. (Soundbite of children) GILLESPIE: Four of them have metal retardation, are blind, have physical disabilities, or a combination of all three. The other three children are healthy. The father married his first cousin, as his parents and grandparents did before him. On the cement terrace outside their two-room home, two blind sisters sit crouched in the corner as they do most days. Diana(ph) is 10 years old. She rubs her balled up fist incessantly into her eyes. She says she doesn't want anyone to see that she's blind. Nadia, age 12, clutches her doll made of sticks tied together with crude twine, her head pointed toward the ground. Mr. MAHMO: (Speaking foreign language) Ms. DIANA MAHMO (Malek's Daughter): (Speaking foreign language) GILLESPIE: Malek asks if Diana is happy with life. She doesn't answer. Mr. MAHMO: (Speaking foreign language) Ms. NADIA MAHMO (Malek's Daughter): (Speaking foreign language) GILLESPIE: Nadia says she wants to go to school but her parents won't let her. Hamudah(ph), their younger brother, is blind and has mental retardation. Little Ahmed, age two, is also blind and requires constant care. Ahmed's body is frail, and though he wiggles his limbs, he can't stand or walk. It's a condition seen throughout the village, but no one seems to know what it is. Malek says the affected children rarely live beyond their teenage years. The families of Kesten say they've consulted doctors around Syria, but no one has been able to diagnose these conditions. Malek says Kesten is a forgotten place. It isn't even listed on road signs. The olive and pomegranate trees around the village belie the poverty within. Men earn a few dollars a day by pulling stones from the hillside, breaking them into pieces, and selling them as construction material in the market a few miles away. In the streets of Kesten, children play in the dirt or in small piles of trash. Many are barefoot, their clothes torn and unwashed. Intermarriage is common in villages like this one. In this case, it's not driven by tradition or religion. Malek says the practice continues simply because families are so poor they can only afford to marry a relative. Mr. MAHMO: (Through translator) You want to marry someone from outside the family, the dowry is usually more expensive, so people marry from within. We even have a saying, he who doesn't marry his cousin dies of his worries. But the truth is, he who marries his cousin dies of his worries. GILLESPIE: The dowry is a serious business because it's used to pay for a modest home and furniture for newlyweds; that can cost up to two thousand dollars. Even with the obvious risks of having children with congenital disabilities, many first cousins here are still willing to take their chances. Hassan is 39 years old. He laughs a lot and entertains his guests with jokes and stories. He relies on a wooden dolly with a T-shaped handle to move around. His legs are only a few inches long and his body is weak. HASSAN: (Speaking foreign language) GILLESPIE: Hassan says his condition is the result of more than 100 years of intermarriage in his family. He reels off a list of his half dozen nieces and nephews with shorten limbs or blindness. Essah(ph), Hassan's younger brother, sits listening quietly in plastic lawn chair. He got married five months ago to his first cousin, and they're trying to have a baby. ESSAH: (Through translator) Yes, I understand the situation, but this is God's will. Should we stop getting married because of this? GILLESPIE: Essah's mentality is what Malek is trying to change. Every disabled child who's born in Kesten will live a short and painful life, he says. Mr. MAHMO: (Through translator) These handicapped people are our brothers and sisters. This is what God chose for us and everyone is responsible. GILLESPIE: Malek, the village schoolteacher, has taken it upon himself to call attention to the problems of Kesten, in the hopes that someone will help. We're poor and in some ways we're ignorant, Malek says. But please make sure everybody understands that we're human beings like everyone else, trying to live a decent life.

It's the first federal rule applied to the new but booming field of nanotechnology and by some accounts it's overdue. NPR's John Nielsen joins us now here in the studio to talk about the EPA's decision. John, let's start out with a little background. What is nanotechnology and why is it booming? JOHN NIELSEN: Well, in basic terms, nanotechnology is a field of study that is built around attempts to manufacture and manipulate and make an absolute ton of money off of things called nanoparticles, and those are not, as some would have you believe, little robots waiting to take over the world, but very, very, very small pieces of matter that it's almost hard for me to explain how small they are. I'll try, however. The smallest nanoparticles are a billionth of a meter wide, and by comparison, the average human hair is about a hundred thousand times that size. NORRIS: So they are beyond teeny. NIELSEN: Yeah, itty-bitty, bitty, bitty. The reason this field is booming is because it's not a research field anymore. There are lots of products coming on to the market. The Woodrow Wilson Institute says $32 billion of products, I mean nanoparticles were sold in 2005 alone. NORRIS: So lots of products, but how are they used? NIELSEN: Well, it's a huge range of uses, and it's supposed to be getting bigger every day. I was just looking around, trying to gather some of them, and nanoparticles are now being used to build synthetic bones, waterproof slacks, faster-burning rocket fuels and shoe liners that can suck the stench out of the most awful gym shoes. And they're also turning up in a very wide range of household cleaning products, and that's of course where the EPA comes in. NORRIS: And so why did the EPA get involved in all this? NIELSEN: Well, the EPA got involved because household cleaning products tend to go down drains and out into waterways. And most of the products we're talking about here, most of the new products, use nanoparticles of silver, and the fact is nobody knows what all those nanoparticles are going to do to the things that live in the waterways or even to the people who drink from the waterways. And organizations like Friends of the Earth and the Natural Resources Defense Council have been complaining very bitterly about that lack of knowledge, and now the EPA has decided to do something about it. Specifically, they've decided to require manufacturers of products with nanoparticles in them to prove that they are safe before they can be put on the market. NORRIS: So when will these new regulations take effect? NIELSEN: Well, I don't know the answer to that, and that's because nobody knows the answer to that. The EPA doesn't know the answer to that because there's a number of steps that haven't been taken yet. First, they have to publish in the federal register. They haven't done that. After that, there could be a whole bunch of public hearings, there could be lawsuits. And if the example of the rule imposed on pesticide companies is illustrative here - the EPA, a long, long time ago asked them to do the same sort of thing with their products - it could take decades because there are a lot of pesticides on the market today that the studies still haven't been done for. NORRIS: John, as I understand, this is the first time that the EPA has regulated a nanoproduct. Is that correct? NIELSEN: Yes. NORRIS: Do you think that we'll see more of these regulations in the future? NIELSEN: Well, I'm just guessing here, but yes. I can't see how they won't. According to the National Science Foundation, this is going to be a trillion-dollar market in about 10 years, and there are going to be thousands of different nanoparticles on the market. Right now, there are about 200. And the EPA and the Food and Drug Administration are already under a lot of pressure for not paying enough attention to these issues, and so as the market grows, the pressure to pay attention is bound to grow with it. NORRIS: John Nielsen, talking to us about the new frontier of nanotechnology. Thanks so much, John. NIELSEN: Thank you.

JOHN NIELSEN: Well, in basic terms, nanotechnology is a field of study that is built around attempts to manufacture and manipulate and make an absolute ton of money off of things called nanoparticles, and those are not, as some would have you believe, little robots waiting to take over the world, but very, very, very small pieces of matter that it's almost hard for me to explain how small they are.  I'll try, however. The smallest nanoparticles are a billionth of a meter wide, and by comparison, the average human hair is about a hundred thousand times that size.  NORRIS: So they are beyond teeny.  NIELSEN: Yeah, itty-bitty, bitty, bitty. The reason this field is booming is because it's not a research field anymore. There are lots of products coming on to the market. The Woodrow Wilson Institute says $32 billion of products, I mean nanoparticles were sold in 2005 alone.  NORRIS: So lots of products, but how are they used?  NIELSEN: Well, it's a huge range of uses, and it's supposed to be getting bigger every day. I was just looking around, trying to gather some of them, and nanoparticles are now being used to build synthetic bones, waterproof slacks, faster-burning rocket fuels and shoe liners that can suck the stench out of the most awful gym shoes. And they're also turning up in a very wide range of household cleaning products, and that's of course where the EPA comes in.  NORRIS: And so why did the EPA get involved in all this?  NIELSEN: Well, the EPA got involved because household cleaning products tend to go down drains and out into waterways. And most of the products we're talking about here, most of the new products, use nanoparticles of silver, and the fact is nobody knows what all those nanoparticles are going to do to the things that live in the waterways or even to the people who drink from the waterways.  And organizations like Friends of the Earth and the Natural Resources Defense Council have been complaining very bitterly about that lack of knowledge, and now the EPA has decided to do something about it. Specifically, they've decided to require manufacturers of products with nanoparticles in them to prove that they are safe before they can be put on the market.  NORRIS: So when will these new regulations take effect?  NIELSEN: Well, I don't know the answer to that, and that's because nobody knows the answer to that. The EPA doesn't know the answer to that because there's a number of steps that haven't been taken yet. First, they have to publish in the federal register. They haven't done that. After that, there could be a whole bunch of public hearings, there could be lawsuits. And if the example of the rule imposed on pesticide companies is illustrative here - the EPA, a long, long time ago asked them to do the same sort of thing with their products - it could take decades because there are a lot of pesticides on the market today that the studies still haven't been done for.  NORRIS: John, as I understand, this is the first time that the EPA has regulated a nanoproduct. Is that correct?  NIELSEN: Yes.  NORRIS: Do you think that we'll see more of these regulations in the future?  NIELSEN: Well, I'm just guessing here, but yes. I can't see how they won't. According to the National Science Foundation, this is going to be a trillion-dollar market in about 10 years, and there are going to be thousands of different nanoparticles on the market. Right now, there are about 200. And the EPA and the Food and Drug Administration are already under a lot of pressure for not paying enough attention to these issues, and so as the market grows, the pressure to pay attention is bound to grow with it.  NORRIS: John Nielsen, talking to us about the new frontier of nanotechnology. Thanks so much, John.  NIELSEN: Thank you. ", "section": "Science", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2006 NPR.

The Environmental Protection Agency is expected to issue a rule that extends one million years into the future. NPR's David Kestenbaum reports. DAVID KESTENBAUM: The new rule deals with the disposal of long-lived nuclear waste from power plants. Even the EPA acknowledges this time scale is new territory. Elizabeth Cotsworth directs the Office of Radiation and Indoor Air at the agency. Ms. ELIZABETH COTSWORTH (EPA): This is totally unprecedented. Most EPA rules apply for perhaps five or six generations into the future. With this rule, we will be basically covering 25,000 generations. KESTENBAUM: In 2002, Congress and President Bush approved plans to store the nuclear waste from power plants inside Yucca Mountain, Nevada. The EPA is responsible for laying out what amounts to a building code for the repository. Initially, the EPA did not want to deal with the million-year standard. It first tried 10,000 years. Ms. COTSWORTH: We thought that that was generally the limit of scientific certainty in our ability to predict with confidence. KESTENBAUM: The rule issued in 2001 said that the repository had to hold up well enough so that if a farmer living nearby 10,000 years from now drinks the groundwater every day, he should get less than a few chest x-rays' worth of radiation in a year. But opponents of Yucca Mountain filed a lawsuit, arguing that the regulation had to extend further into the future. The courts agreed, so last year the EPA proposed this additional radiation standard that extends a hundred times further, to one million years. But a million years is geologic time. The EPA has no idea if there will even be farmers around then to protect. Can we do a little experiment? Ms. COTSWORTH: Okay. KESTENBAUM: Let's pretend we have a time machine. We go in the time machine and we go forward one million years. What do you think the world looks like? Ms. COTSWORTH: Oh, my gosh. I don't - I don't - I would not be able to articulate what the world would look like. KESTENBAUM: Do you think it's all cockroaches, it's people, it's robots? Ms. COTSWORTH: I have - I've no idea. KESTENBAUM: Who does? Well, one way to get a sense for what can change over a million years is to look back, because we have a pretty good idea for what the Earth was like a million years ago. (Soundbite of music) Mr. RICK POTTS (Smithsonian Museum of Natural History): Well, going into a time machine, it would depend upon where you landed. KESTENBAUM: Our time traveler is Rick Potts, director of the human origins program at the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History. Mr. POTTS: If you were to land in East Africa. . . KESTENBAUM: In East Africa, you'd see a strange creature walking on two legs. Mr. POTTS: A part of you would think, oh my goodness, this is one of us. This is an ancestor to me. But you would also notice the beetling brow, the brow ridge and the sloping of the forehead and also a tremendous muscular build of those early humans that makes you think, I'm not quite sure I'd ever want to shake hands with this individual. We're wimps in comparison to them. KESTENBAUM: Life changed a lot in a million years. Our ancestors had brain cases that were one-third smaller than ours. They hadn't harnessed fire or started to make clothing. Neanderthals were still in the future. Mr. POTTS: A million years ago is an exceptionally a long time. And you know, even though I study it, I go out to Africa every summer to study one million years ago and what it means, it still takes me some time to wrap my mind around it. KESTENBAUM: If things continue as they have, something like humans will be around in another million years. We will look different and have vastly more advanced technology. A million years ago, hand axes were all the rage. Today we have nuclear power plants and nuclear waste. Remember, the concern is that a million years from now, a farmer could drink water contaminated with radioactive waste and get cancer. But in a million years, we might have cured cancer. Dr. PETER RAVDIN (University of Texas): Oh, I think that, yes, we will certainly have cured cancer. KESTENBAUM: Peter Ravdin is a cancer researcher and physician with the University of Texas. Dr. RAVDIN: Even now, the risk of dying of breast cancer in the United States is falling about two percent a year, so that suggests a timeline much shorter than a million years, it will have cured cancer. KESTENBAUM: Ravdin feels we do have a duty to think about the long term future though. He points to the last book astronomer Carl Sagan wrote, called Demon Haunted World. Dr. RAVDIN: Which he wrote while he was dying of cancer, unfortunately. But he's emphasized the point that there were two very different possibilities for the future. And one of them would be reflecting our better side, and one would be reflecting our worst, and that both were possible. KESTENBAUM: The debate over the million-year standard can be seen as both. It's a testimony to our better side, a desire to protect future generations; and our worse side, a reminder that when something controversial comes up, someone will always file a lawsuit.

Now, a new national survey finds that such ties are also common among academics who serve on panels called institutional review boards.

SNIGDHA PRAKASH: Institutional review boards are relatively new edition to the scientific landscape. There's the product of scientific scandals such as the Tuskegee experiments, which began in the 1930s and continued up to the 1970s, in which African American men with syphilis were left untreated so that the U. S. Public Health Service could follow the course of untreated syphilis. Historian David Rothman of Columbia University has written extensively on the subject and says that as the public learned about Tuskegee and others scandals. Professor DAVID ROTHMAN (Columbia University): There was a mounting public awareness at the conduct of human experimentation where subjects were not told they were in research, where subjects from relatively low socioeconomic status were used essentially as the language of the day would have it, essentially as Guinea pigs. PRAKASH: From that outrage came a federal law that required human experiments by the federal government must first be approved by bodies called institutional review boards. All the large research universities created review boards and they reviewed not just federally funded research, but research funded by industry as well. This is the first time that a large national survey has looked at whether these crucial gatekeepers are affected by conflicts of interest that plague many other parts of science. The results of the survey are published in this week's New England Journal of Medicine. Eric Campbell of the Institute for Health Policy at the Massachusetts General Hospital, who led the study, says a third of the survey's respondents had had financial relationships with industry over the previous year. Mr. ERIC CAMPBELL (Massachusetts General Hospital): Relationships such as having research funding from companies serving as paid speakers and so on. PRAKASH: For a smaller number of the respondents, 15 percent, those relationships presented potential conflicts of interest. Those members had done work for a company or its competitor whose study they were asked to vote on. And while most said they didn't vote on the studies when they were presented to the Institutional Review Board or IRB -Mr. CAMPBELL: A small percentage, about seven percent of all IRB members reported that they had voted on a study proposal that was sponsored by a company with which they had a relationship. PRAKASH: Two thirds of survey respondents said their institutions dealt with potential conflicts by disclosing the ties, Campbell says. Mr. CAMPBELL: But a third of members said either their IRB didn't have such a process or they didn't know of it. Well, not knowing is the functional equivalent of not having. PRAKASH: Still most survey respondents, an overwhelming 85 percent said the financial ties hadn't posed any problems on the review boards and indeed most said the presence of members with industry ties enhanced the work of the boards. David Rothman of Columbia University is less sanguine. He says for example there is research that shows scientists don't believe their financial ties affect their scientific decisions, but they do. If two thirds of IRB members don't have ties to industry he says, why not make sure the remaining third are also free of conflicts. Snigdha Prakash, NPR News, Washington.

The agency levied the fine after inspecting one of the nation's largest blood processing centers in New York State.  This is just the latest in a long series of actions by the FDA against the American Red Cross.  Here to talk about the situation is NPR's John Hamilton.   John, this sounds bad.  What did they find? JOHN HAMILTON: Well, the biggest thing they found was that the Red Cross has really not implemented a plan it was supposed to have implemented to improve its safety procedures and bookkeeping.  This has been several years in the works and this is the first time that the FDA was really checking to see how it was going, and they saw a number of procedural problems and bookkeeping problems and that sort of thing. ELLIOTT: Can you give us an example of the type of problems that they found? HAMILTON: Yeah. One of the worst things that they found was an example where they went in and looked at this blood processing center and they found that a unit of blood that had been marked contaminated was in a bin with blood units that were not contaminated or had been marked safe.  So you have the potential then for bad blood to get to somebody at the other end.  Now, that's not likely to happen because there are a whole series of checks along the way and any unit that was marked that it was contaminated, there would be so many steps where somebody could catch it and the chances of getting to somebody are almost infinitesimal.  But it's still the possibility.   ELLIOTT: Does this mean that people should be concerned about the blood supply from the Red Cross? HAMILTON: Well, the FDA itself has gone out of the way several times in the past few years to say that they do not believe that the nation's blood supply is unsafe, and the failures they've found on inspections have not been linked to people actually getting hurt. ELLIOTT: So they sound like a lot of management issues. HAMILTON: Yeah.  The blood banking industry is sort of a cross between Federal Express and a hospital.  You're trying to make millions of deliveries every day, but every one of them has to be certified safe.  So if you think about that, you can imagine all of the procedures that have to go on to make sure that everything gets to the right place and is correctly labeled and so on.  And so when you find errors, it's not usually that the blood that eventually got there was dangerous, it's usually that somewhere along the way there was a problem, but the blood was allowed to go to the next step before that problem was acted on.  That sort of thing. ELLIOTT: Now, this was a five million dollar fine.  That sounds like a pretty hefty fine. HAMILTON: It sounds like a lot.  On the other hand, the blood banking business in this country is billions of dollars.  So as a percentage of that, you know, five million dollars is not that big. ELLIOTT: Now, I understand that this is not the first time that the FDA has had some problems with the way the Red Cross operates. HAMILTON: Not at all.  These problems go back to at least 1993, which is the first time that the FDA and the Red Cross entered into agreement to try to fix some of these problems with the way they were dealing with blood.  They went back and revisited those in 2003, and what's happened here suggests that even now, the problems are not solved. And this all gets to a larger problem, which is that the Red Cross itself has been in a state of turmoil, if you will. They've gone through a number of presidents. They're acting under an interim president right now. They're talking about reforming their board. They're talking about changing their charter. It's clear that this is an organization that is having trouble figuring out exactly how it needs to run itself. ELLIOTT: Now, what happens if the Red Cross fails to remedy these bookkeeping and labeling problems that the FDA has cited it for most recently? HAMILTON: The FDA could shut down individual blood centers, or all of them, if they wanted to. It has regulatory control over them. However, the Red Cross provides more than 40 percent of all of the blood that is supplied in this country. This is a country where we don't have enough blood. There are continual shortages, so losing 40 percent is really not an option. ELLIOTT: NPR's Jon Hamilton, thank you. HAMILTON: You're welcome.  DEBBIE ELLIOTT, host:  This past week, the Food and Drug Administration fined the American Red Cross more than five million dollars for blood safety problems.  The agency levied the fine after inspecting one of the nation's largest blood processing centers in New York State.  This is just the latest in a long series of actions by the FDA against the American Red Cross.  Here to talk about the situation is NPR's John Hamilton.    John, this sounds bad.  What did they find?  JOHN HAMILTON: Well, the biggest thing they found was that the Red Cross has really not implemented a plan it was supposed to have implemented to improve its safety procedures and bookkeeping.  This has been several years in the works and this is the first time that the FDA was really checking to see how it was going, and they saw a number of procedural problems and bookkeeping problems and that sort of thing.  ELLIOTT: Can you give us an example of the type of problems that they found?  HAMILTON: Yeah. One of the worst things that they found was an example where they went in and looked at this blood processing center and they found that a unit of blood that had been marked contaminated was in a bin with blood units that were not contaminated or had been marked safe.  So you have the potential then for bad blood to get to somebody at the other end.  Now, that's not likely to happen because there are a whole series of checks along the way and any unit that was marked that it was contaminated, there would be so many steps where somebody could catch it and the chances of getting to somebody are almost infinitesimal.  But it's still the possibility.    ELLIOTT: Does this mean that people should be concerned about the blood supply from the Red Cross?  HAMILTON: Well, the FDA itself has gone out of the way several times in the past few years to say that they do not believe that the nation's blood supply is unsafe, and the failures they've found on inspections have not been linked to people actually getting hurt.  ELLIOTT: So they sound like a lot of management issues.  HAMILTON: Yeah.  The blood banking industry is sort of a cross between Federal Express and a hospital.  You're trying to make millions of deliveries every day, but every one of them has to be certified safe.  So if you think about that, you can imagine all of the procedures that have to go on to make sure that everything gets to the right place and is correctly labeled and so on.  And so when you find errors, it's not usually that the blood that eventually got there was dangerous, it's usually that somewhere along the way there was a problem, but the blood was allowed to go to the next step before that problem was acted on.  That sort of thing.  ELLIOTT: Now, this was a five million dollar fine.  That sounds like a pretty hefty fine.  HAMILTON: It sounds like a lot.  On the other hand, the blood banking business in this country is billions of dollars.  So as a percentage of that, you know, five million dollars is not that big.  ELLIOTT: Now, I understand that this is not the first time that the FDA has had some problems with the way the Red Cross operates.  HAMILTON: Not at all.  These problems go back to at least 1993, which is the first time that the FDA and the Red Cross entered into agreement to try to fix some of these problems with the way they were dealing with blood.  They went back and revisited those in 2003, and what's happened here suggests that even now, the problems are not solved.  And this all gets to a larger problem, which is that the Red Cross itself has been in a state of turmoil, if you will. They've gone through a number of presidents. They're acting under an interim president right now. They're talking about reforming their board. They're talking about changing their charter. It's clear that this is an organization that is having trouble figuring out exactly how it needs to run itself.  ELLIOTT: Now, what happens if the Red Cross fails to remedy these bookkeeping and labeling problems that the FDA has cited it for most recently?  HAMILTON: The FDA could shut down individual blood centers, or all of them, if they wanted to. It has regulatory control over them. However, the Red Cross provides more than 40 percent of all of the blood that is supplied in this country. This is a country where we don't have enough blood.

AVM, as it's known, is an abnormal connection between the arteries and veins. It can occur anywhere in the body, but when it happens in the brain, it can have widespread and serious effects.  Remember Nate from the TV show \"Six Feet Under\"? That's what he had. (Soundbite of TV show, \"Six Feet Under\") Unidentified Man (Actor): (As Doctor) Yup. It definitely looks like AVM. Mr. PETER KRAUSE (Actor): (As Nate) If I'd never been in a car, I shouldn't have gotten a routine x-ray on my skull, this would have never even come up, right? Unidentified Man: (As Doctor) Until something happened. BRAND: Here to tell us more about AVM is Dr. John Marler of the National Institutes of Health. Welcome to the program. Dr. JOHN MARLOR (National Institutes of Health): Thank you. BRAND: I understand that AVM is created before birth in utero or shortly after and Senator Tim Johnson just suffered symptoms. He's 59 years old. So that suggests that someone with this condition can live a long time without symptoms, so -  Dr. MARLER: Live your whole life.  BRAND: Your whole life. How common is it? Dr. MARLER: It's not that common. It probably affects at most a few percentages of people. It's really hard to determine because people can live their whole lives with an AVM and never make it into anybody's medical record. BRAND: Do doctors know what causes the blood vessels to develop abnormally in utero? Dr. MARLER: No, we don't. AVMs when we discover them are all shapes and sizes. They often are discovered incidentally as in Nate doing an x-ray or a brain scan for another reason. Sometimes they present with a seizure and occasionally with bleeding. When they present with bleeding, it's usually - I won't say minor - but it's not the serious kind of bleeding that is often fatal that occurs with the bleeding that comes from high blood pressure, another cause of the bleeding. BRAND: And it appears in Senator Johnson's case that he did present with symptoms. He had slurred speech. And NPR has information that the location of the AVM is in the part of his brain that influences speech and movement, so if that turns out to be true, is that a more serious form of AVM? Dr. MARLER: It's hard to tell at this time a specific case from the information. Usually, the bleeding from an AVM goes into the cavities of the brain and doesn't destroy the tissue of the brain. It's that that we're concerned about, is how well the brain survives this bleeding. Later, decisions can be made about whether to totally remove the AVM or to just let it take its natural course. BRAND: And would the patient have to then undergo some sort of rehab? Dr. MARLER: It depends on the deficit that's left if there's any disability at all. I mean, at this point, it wouldn't be unusual to have a very good recovery so that rehab wouldn't even be required. It depends entirely on the individual case.  As I say usually the hemorrhage from AVM is not as serious as other brain hemorrhages that might lead people to have a lot of concern. BRAND: Dr. John Marler of the National Institutes of Health.

An item in the New York Times Magazine caught our eye this past week. It said that while men's brains are bigger, women have the same number of brain cells. They're just more tightly packed. Neuropsychiatrist LeaAnn Brizendine, who spoke with the Times, told me that male and female brains start going down separate paths very early on.  Ms. LEAANN BRIZENDINE (Neuropsychiatrist): Well, one thing we know for sure, Debbie, is that we all start out with a female-type brain in utero up until eight weeks of fetal life, when the tiny testicles and the male fetus start pumping out all that testosterone. It goes up and marinates the brain, changes it from female-type brain circuits into male brain circuits, increasing some areas, like the areas for sexual pursuit. And once we're born, we either have a female-type brain or a male-type brain. ELLIOT: And how does that affect us when we're grown? Ms. BRIZENDINE: Well, once we're grown, of course, then we start having the hormones that run our circuits. Right, the testosterone in the male starting in puberty starts to run the male brain circuits, and estrogen and progesterone in the female start to run the female brain circuits, getting us all ready for fertility and bearing children, pregnancy, breast-feeding and all the things that the female brain has to control. ELLIOTT: Now, I saw you quoted in the New York Times, speaking of pregnancy, that the female brain shrinks about eight percent during pregnancy and doesn't return back to its normal size until about six months after delivery? Ms. BRIZENDINE: Yes, Debbie, that's a surprising study that has found eight percent shrinkage even after you account for any increased water weight. And scientists don't know really why that happens except that the female brain is doing all kinds of rewiring during that period to get the mom ready to do maternal behavior. And also, remember, the fetus is more like a parasite and it gets fed whatever it wants, and lots and lots of lipids and special fats exist inside the brain cells, so some scientists speculate that the fetus is sort of snacking on the mother's brain. ELLIOTT: That explains what I used to describe as pregnancy brain. Ms. BRIZENDINE: Yes, exactly. ELLIOTT: Was I just making an excuse or was I really impaired because my brain was smaller when I was pregnant? Ms. BRIZENDINE: No, Debbie, I think that your - remember, you've got 30 or 40 times the level of estrogen and progesterone coursing through your brain, getting you ready for the job at hand. But the good news is, at six months post-partum, the female brain comes back to its regular size and there are even some studies that show that we may be even smarter after the size returns and we have better connections. ELLIOTT: LeaAnne Brizendine is a professor of neuropsychiatry at the University of California at San Francisco. Thank you. Ms. BRIZENDINE: Thanks for having me, Debbie.

In Boston, researchers are trying to map out how the human brain weighs morality in making decisions. From member station WBUR, Allan Coukell reports. ALLAN COUKELL: You've got a position on abortion, gay marriage, the Iraq War. You believe you're right, of course, but how do you know? Professor JOSH GREENE (Harvard University): We tend to rely rather uncritically on our moral intuitions. We tend to think that we just see the moral world as it objectively is.  COUKELL: Josh Greene of Harvard University is one of a small number of scientists delving into the science of moral decisions. Prof. GREENE: And the more you learn about your moral intuitions, the more you realize that they're actually not as trustworthy as they seem. COUKELL: Consider the trolley problem, which philosophers and scientists love.  (Soundbite of a trolley)  COUKELL: You're standing beside the trolley track. The train is baring down with five people in its path. If it hits them, they'll be killed. But you have a choice. You can hit a switch to divert the trolley onto another track, where there's one person standing. Do you hit the switch to save five lives at the cost of one?  Professor MARC HAUSER (Harvard University): Based on thousands and thousands of subjects, people consistently say yes to that question. COUKELL: This is Harvard psychologist Marc Hauser.  Prof. HAUSER: Yes, it's permissible to flip the switch, leading the train onto the sidetrack where it will kill the one to save the five. COUKELL: But interestingly, one small change in the dilemma gives the opposite answer. This time, instead of a switch, you're on a footbridge over the tracks, standing next to a large man. To stop the train and save five people below, your only option is to push the man off the bridge and into the path of the train. Do you do it? Prof. GREENE: Here people say no.  COUKELL: So people say it's okay to pull a switch, send the trolley down a different track and kill one person instead of five. Not okay to push somebody onto the track and kill one person instead of five. Prof. HAUSER: That's right. So people are making a distinction. And typically, when we ask people why is one case permissible but the other is not, people simply do not have good reasons to explain those distinctions. COUKELL: Mark Houser and Josh Greene say the trolley problem, and scenarios like it, prove that our moral judgments are not the rational decisions we might think. So Greene decided to get inside the head to see how it all happens. He put volunteers into an MRI scanner, looking to see which parts of the brain were activated by the two versions, the switch and the footbridge version of the trolley problem.  Prof. GREENE: And what we found is that the cases like the footbridge case seemed to produce more of an emotional response, or at least more brain activity in brain regions that are associated with emotional response. COUKELL: There are other clues about the workings of our moral intuition. For example, experiments show that we always consider harm caused by physical contact with another to be worse than harm caused without physical contact. Some scientists think these kinds of moral rules might constitute a kind of universal moral grammar. (Soundbite of MRI scanner) Professor REBECCA SAXE (MIT) Okay, we're ready here. And we're going to start with the moral judgment task. COUKELL: To test a different aspect of morality, Rebecca Saxe, a cognitive scientist at MIT, offered to put me in the MRI scanner.  Prof. SAXE: Are you ready for this? COUKELL: Yeah.  Prof. SAXE: Okay, here goes. (Soundbite of MRI scanner) COUKELL: Saxe studies what you could call guilt or innocence. She's looking at a part of the brain that lights up when we're asked to judge how other people behave. So I'm laying on my back inside the scanner reading a series of moral questions. One of the scenarios: a girl builds an igloo that she believes is safe, but it isn't. The walls are likely to collapse. Her friend comes over and asks if she could go in the igloo. And the girl says, yes. Yes, you can go in. The friend goes in and the walls collapse. Was it acceptable for her to allow her friend to go in the igloo? And I said that it was because she believes it was safe. Of all the different moral scenarios Saxe has studied - deliberate harm, no harm - it's these accidental harm scenarios that cause the biggest spike in brain activity. It seems our brains work especially hard when we evaluate whether or not someone made an honest mistake; that principle seems somehow special. Saxe isn't sure what that means, but she finds an interesting correlation in the law, which is, after all, how a society formally encodes morality. Prof. SAXE: This principle - if you made a reasonable mistake, what you did was not forbidden - is encoded in every known legal system. COUKELL: If the science can help us understand how we make moral decisions, Josh Green at Harvard hopes it can also change them.  Prof. GREENE: If we all were more focused on consequences and trying to make the world a better place, and less beholding to our intuitive emotional responses, we might all be better off.  COUKELL: The neuroscience of morality is in its infancy. Some traditional philosophers think it's too crude to be useful, but the scientists believe it's the right thing to do.

I'm Alex Chadwick. And now the story of a virgin birth, really. This is occurring at the Chester Zoo in Northern England, where a Komodo dragon named Flora is expecting seven young ones with no male assistance. She is only the second Komodo dragon ever to do this all by herself.  We're joined by one of the wise men attending Flora, Kevin Buley. He's reptile curator at the Chester Zoo.  Kevin, welcome. And what a season, what a thing, what is going on? Mr. KEVIN BULEY (Reptile Curator, Chester Zoo, England): Yeah, you couldn't beat the timing, could you, really? Is that Flora, our female Komodo dragon, laid a clutch of eggs for us back in May, this year, which is not unusual for a dragon to do this, even though she's not been mated. And Flora has actually never even seen a male.  CHADWICK: She's never seen a male, so you know that she has both laid these eggs and fertilized them herself. This is a process called parthenogenesis. It's known to happen in lizards, but not really in Komodo dragons. Mr. BULEY: That's right, yeah. Parthenogenesis literally means, when you translate it from the Greek, virgin birth. And it's been reported in up to 70 species of vertebra on the planet. But this is really the first time it's ever been recorded in such a large and charismatic animal. CHADWICK: It is just a coincidence that it's happening around this time. You actually could have a virgin birth any day now? Mr. BULEY: Yeah, well, not so much a birth, more of a hatching. But certainly, the eggs were conceived without a father. Because they were laid back in May, the incubation period for Komodo dragon eggs is anything between seven and nine months. The earliest these things could hatch out - and I'm not making this up, I promise - is actually Christmas Day.  CHADWICK: Wow. Okay. Komodo dragons are native to Indonesia. Describe a Komodo dragon, will you, because they're quite imposing creatures? Mr. BULEY: They are. They're incredibly impressive animals. They're the largest lizards on the planet, by a long way. An adult male can reach up to three meters or nine feet in length; enormous, very effective predators. The main way the adult male's skill is to actually use a host of deadly bacteria that they carry around in their saliva. And what they'll do is to bite a large prey item, and then they track it around for anything for up to four days, while they wait for the poor victim to die of blood poisoning. And when they. . . CHADWICK: There's a cheery Christmas note for you. (Soundbite of laughter)  Mr. BULEY: Well, an adult male Komodo dragon can eat anything up 80 percent of its own body weight in one sitting, which is a big Christmas dinner for anybody, really.  CHADWICK: Kevin, what are you going to do? Are you going to celebrate this birth in some way? Mr. BULEY: We're cautious here and we certainly don't want to count our dragons before they have hatched. But, if and when they do hatch, yes, I'm sure there'll be cause for celebration here.  CHADWICK: Kevin Buley, reptile curator at the Chester Zoo in Northern England, where Flora is expecting seven at any moment. Kevin, thank you.  Mr. BULEY: Bye-bye.   ALEX CHADWICK, host:   This is DAY TO DAY. I'm Alex Chadwick.  And now the story of a virgin birth, really. This is occurring at the Chester Zoo in Northern England, where a Komodo dragon named Flora is expecting seven young ones with no male assistance. She is only the second Komodo dragon ever to do this all by herself.   We're joined by one of the wise men attending Flora, Kevin Buley. He's reptile curator at the Chester Zoo.   Kevin, welcome. And what a season, what a thing, what is going on?  Mr. KEVIN BULEY (Reptile Curator, Chester Zoo, England): Yeah, you couldn't beat the timing, could you, really? Is that Flora, our female Komodo dragon, laid a clutch of eggs for us back in May, this year, which is not unusual for a dragon to do this, even though she's not been mated.

I'm Robert Siegel. MELISSA BLOCK, host: And I'm Melissa Block. Every year the journal Science selects a breakthrough of the year. This time it's the solution of a century old math problem. NPR's David Kestenbaum is digging into the story behind that solution and it is quite a soap opera. It involves a Harvard math wizard, a reclusive Russian genius, a million dollar prize, an award winning journalist, The New Yorker magazine and, of course, a lawyer. DAVID KESTENBAUM: In August, The New Yorker magazine published a 14 page article called \u201cManifold Destiny: a Legendary Problem and the Battle Over Who Solved It. \u201d The article is written by Sylvia Masser, whose book \u201cA Beautiful Mind\u201d inspired a blockbuster movie. She wrote the article with a science writer who had been a student of hers. The legendary math problem is the Poincare Conjecture laid out by Henri Poincare back in 1904. Many tried to solve it and failed. Here's how Shing-Tung Yau describes it. He's the Harvard mathematician in this story. Mr. SHING-UNG YAU (Harvard Mathematician): Poincare Conjecture is considered to be the Holy Grail of Geometry and Topology. For many topologists, they consider that to be their lifetime goal. KESTENBAUM: Also it's worth a million dollars. A mathematics institute has an outstanding award for solving it. The Conjecture has to do with objects that could exist in four dimensional space. That's one more dimension than we have in real life so it is impossible to visualize this. But the challenge is to prove that every twisty-turny shape that doesn't have a hole in it can be reformed into a kind of sphere. In 1982, a mathematician named Richard Hamilton proposed a new approach to solving it. It was revolutionary. He would use the sort of equations that governed heat flow in physics to smooth out the mathematical shapes. Hamilton has a reputation as a kind of surfer mathematician. Yau and Hamilton worked on the problem together, sometimes far from the chalkboard in Hawaii where Hamilton had a house. Mr. YAU: And we worked together on a beach under coconut tree. It was nice setting, but it was hot. It was not what people think that we were just relaxed. KESTENBAUM: Yau wrote a Chinese poem about this period. He describes Hamilton looking utterly exhausted. Quote, \u201cThe road was long and the sky far away. \u201d Hamilton made considerable progress over the decades but could not find his way past the remaining obstacles. Then suddenly in 2002 came a mysterious mathematical paper published on the Internet. It was written by a Russian mathematician who had dropped out of sight named Grigori Perelman. Perelman published two more papers. The work appeared to break through the remaining barriers. Perelman made a trip to the United States. He had a beard and long fingernails. John Morgan met Perelman on that trip. Morgan is chair of the math department at Columbia University and talked to NPR this summer. Mr. JOHN MORGAN (Columbia University): He worked for five or seven years, I'm not sure how long, incredibly intensively on this and he's incredibly brilliant and powerful, and he did something that I don't think anybody else could have done. KESTENBAUM: Many people had doubts about Perelman's papers. They were spare and didn't spell things out. Yau couldn't tell if Perelman had in fact completed the proof of the Poincare Conjecture. Mr. YAU: I could not know how to put the proof together presumably because I'm stupid. I'm not good enough to understand it. But most of the people of the best minds in the world had difficulty to put the proof together. KESTENBAUM: There were only a handful of people in the world with the expertise to judge whether the Poincare Conjecture had been proven. Yau encouraged two of his prot\u00e9g\u00e9es to flush out Perelman's arguments, Huai-Dong Cao and Zhu Xi-Ping. It took two years. They've now published a 328-page paper titled in part \u201cA Complete Proof of the Poincare\u201d. Two other groups published similarly long explanations. Today mathematicians agree, Perelman's brief papers contained the final solution. But who should get the credit? Richard Hamilton, who came up with the approach and labored under the coconut tree? The Russian, Grigori Perelman, who carried it over the finish line? What about the Chinese mathematicians and the others who flushed everything out? What about Yau who helped lay the groundwork for the entire field? Here's where The New Yorker magazine comes in. It tackled the question in its August issue. The story suggested that Yau was trying to steal the spotlight. A full-page cartoon in the article captures the tone. It shows the Russian mathematician Grigori Perelman with a medal around his neck and Shing-Tung Yau of Harvard grabbing the medal. Yau remembers getting a copy of the magazine from the newsstand and feeling shocked. Mr. YAU: I was totally amazed because I forced to to write only about the Poincare Conjecture. KESTENBAUM: Did you feel the article was inaccurate? Mr. YAU: Yes. KESTENBAUM: The article caused a big fuss. Mathematicians felt it made them look bad and petty at a time when they should be celebrating a major achievement. Some saw the article as a hatchet job. One called it hideously unfair. But Yau is a controversial figure in the math world. He's gotten into some academic scrapes in China, and some colleagues feel there have been times when he could have been more generous about acknowledging the work of others. One key moment in the New Yorker story takes place at a press conference in China. It touches on the question of who deserves credit for solving the Poincare Conjecture. The New Yorker quotes a Chinese mathematician as saying that Yau and his prot\u00e9g\u00e9es deserve 30% of the credit for solving the Poincare Conjecture. And it quotes Yau himself, apparently affirming this, saying, quote, \u201cthat Chinese mathematicians played a 30% role is by no means easy. \u201d Yau says Sylvia Masser, the New Yorker writer, was not at the conference, was not even in China, as far as he knows. And he says those quotes are flat wrong. Did you say that? Mr. YAU: No. KESTENBAUM: Did you say anything like that? Mr. YAU: No, not at the press conference. KESTENBAUM: Did you say it at any time? Mr. YAU: There could be a misunderstanding of what things were said. KESTENBAUM: Yau says he may have later said something about Chinese mathematicians playing a big role in the field of Geometry. Mr. YAU: I was trying to encourage the Chinese youngsters. China is a huge country with many, many young mathematicians. They are beaten and they need to be helped. KESTENBAUM: Yau says he did not mean to downplay Perelman's contribution. Mr. YAU: Perelman's idea is truly original and genius, so we are happy with that. KESTENBAUM: And this is where a lawyer gets involved with a hundred year old math problem. Shing-Tung Yau hired an attorney who is now trying to get an apology from the New Yorker and correction of what he says are errors. Fifteen mathematicians have written letters defending Yau. Mr. DAN STRUCK (MIT): Yau is a very robust mathematician. KESTENBAUM: Dan Struck is a mathematician at MIT. Mr. STRUCK: He has a muscular approach to problems and I have often felt that he solves problems by scaring them to death. KESTENBAUM: Struk wrote, \u201clike the rest of us, Yau has his fauls. But unlike most of us, his virtues out weigh his faults. \u201d The New Yorker article covers a lot of ground and Yau has a long list of complaints. We looked in at that quote at the press conference. NPR translated an audiotape of the press conference provided by Yau. It does not include any references to percentage credit. We interviewed the other mathematician who is quoted at the press conference, who denies anything about percentage credit. Sylvia Masser declined repeated requests for interviews for this story. The New Yorker issued a statement saying it stands by the story. The magazine said it was the result of approximately 100 interviews. Some mathematicians we spoke to chalk the dispute up to differences in style, mathematical style. Here's Dan Struck from MIT. Mr. STRUCK: Yau comes from a tradition in which you build empires. That's part of being a great mind, and this is really counter to the post 1960s culture of mathematics where you're supposed to be just one of the fellows and nice guy and everybody does beautiful work. Yau doesn't take that point of view. He thinks highly of some people and he thinks poorly of others and he does not make much effort to hide his opinion of either. KESTENBAUM: Mathematicians often talk about that transcended nature of mathematical truth. But the daily labor is done by humans with all of the attendant complications. Henri Poincare wrote thought is only a flash in the midst of a long night, but this flash is everything. David Kestenbaum, NPR News.

But today we came across one extraordinary forecast. According to the National Weather Service Web page, the weather in San Jose, California, this coming weekend look to be, let's say, inclement - a bone chilling negative 30,000 Fahrenheit. And combine that with a 30,000 percent chance of precipitation. It sounded like a weekend south of the San Francisco Bay when you'd be better off staying indoors. We spoke with the forecaster at the National Weather Service office who assured us that this was not the actual forecast for this weekend. He chocked the error up to a computer glitch during the graveyard shift. But we couldn't help but wonder, what would weather like that mean for the San Jose area? Well, Alison Bridger is chair of the meteorology department at San Jose State University. ALISON BRIDGER: The coldest temperature in San Jose I've seen is about 17 Fahrenheit. SIEGEL: She told us that the temperature anywhere near 30,000 below zero, would obviously be record breaking, but there wouldn't be anyone around to record the record. BRIDGER: We'd be unconscious and dead long before it got that cold. I shutter to think. I mean, everything would freeze up obviously, and the atmosphere would condense out. There'd be nothing to breathe. SIEGEL: Alison Bridger said the actual weather right now in San Jose isn't a picnic either. BRIDGER: The big event that's going on tonight is the high winds that we've experiencing and various pieces of garden furniture flying by. And we have a small dog and we don't dare let her out. She might blow away. SIEGEL: But despite the wind chill, it not going to get anywhere near negative 30,000 degrees this weekend, which is good news to Paul Grant. PAUL GRANT: My son and I are going skiing tomorrow and we're hoping for cold weather, but not really that cold. I mean, that's a real howler. SIEGEL: Mr. Grant is a visiting scholar of applied physics at Stanford University and he lives in San Jose. GRANT: To have a temperature of minus 30,000 degrees Fahrenheit would violently violate all the known laws of physics. SIEGEL: And even at the more temperate absolute zero, skiing wouldn't be very fun. GRANT: Well, that's true. And it is thermodynamically impossible to lower the temperature of anything to absolute zero. It would take all the energy of the universe and in a refrigerator to get there. And just for the record, Steve Anderson of the National Weather Service in Monterey, California, gladly gave us this weekend's actual outlook. STEVE ANDERSON: And the forecast for the remaining of the weekend, through the weekend, overnight lows are ranged from 40 to 45 degrees.

I'm Noah Adams. MADELEINE BRAND, host: And I'm Madeleine Brand. Early next year, the Centers For Decease Control And Prevention will begin an investigation into what's come to be called Morgellons disease. This disease though may not actually exist, at least not physically. Patients with Morgellons believe they are infested with bugs, parasites or worms, and they think they have fibers and fuzz growing out of their skin. The CDC is proceeding unusually quickly with this investigation. It's an investigation that is fueled in large part by the Internet. NPR's Patty Neighmond reports. PATRICIA NEIGHMOND: Gail Anderson(ph) lives in Southern California with her 83-year-old mother in a modest apartment complex behind a shopping center. Anderson is 57 years old, but her room has a childlike appeal. A canopy draped over her bed. Cute little statues and dried flowers scattered about. It was six years ago when Anderson says she felt odd sensations: something crawling under her scalp, a feeling that fuzz balls were popping out on her back after she showered and dried off, and then, what ultimately send her to the doctor the first time. Ms. GAIL ANDERSON: I thought that there were worms in my eyes. I felt as if something was eating out of the top of the tissue. And I could see in my left eye that there was something going on. And up inside the inner of my eyelashes, I had white spots that all looked like tiny little eggs. And I had showed them to friends of mine at that time. And they said that's weird; it wasn't, you know, the sandman type of thing. It was - they were little white, like little eggs all in here, crusty, and then, on the outer of my eyelid. So, I attributed this to the sensation I feel in my eyeballs. NEIGHMOND: But Anderson's doctor found nothing wrong. Then Anderson says fibers, brightly colored red, green and blue ones started popping out all over her skin and her arms and legs. She got rashes and lesions. Eventually, Anderson saw a dermatologist who took a skin scraping and sent if off to the lab. The result, the scraping was classified as debris, no bugs, no worms. Anderson didn't buy it. Ms. ANDERSON: You think you're going to go and get some understanding and some treatment, and some compassion, but you don't. There is no compassion there. You're a loony tune. NEIGHMOND: Meanwhile across the country, another woman was equally frustrated, Mary Lato(ph) noticed fibers coming out of her 3-year-old son's skin, as well as lesions and rashes. Her little boy seems to think he had bugs on him. Lato took him to lots of doctors, but like Gail Anderson, she wasn't satisfied with the answers she got. For a while, her son was treated for scabies mites. At one point, Lato took a scraping from his skin and looked at it under a microscope. Ms. MARY LATO: What I was expecting to see were scabies mites. And what I did see were what appear to be balls of fibers. And there were dozens and dozens of them. A lot of them are white; some were blue, and occasional pieces of red. Lato says doctors couldn't or wouldn't analyze the fibers. Finally, she turned to the Internet. I did some searches for the life cycle of scabies mites, and didn't see anything, which would explain this material. And I ended up on a scabies message board and met some people who saw me posting about these fibers. And they contacted me to say essentially if your child has fibers coming out of his skin, then you have a bigger problem than you realize. NEIGHMOND: They told her they had similar symptoms, and had tried for years without success to find out what was wrong. Ms. LATO: At that point, not finding anything in the literature, realizing that other people had the illness, and had had it for a while without any resolve. I decided if I put up a Web site with some micrographs, microscopic photographs, that maybe some scientists or some medical researchers, who knew something about this illness might contact me, might help me understand what was wrong with my child, and how to make him well. NEIGHMOND: Today, Mary Lato is overwhelmed by her Web site. She has 3,300 unread e-mails, and no idea how she'll ever get to them. She says most people want emotional support and referral to a doctor who will take their symptoms seriously. Some find their way to internist Rafael Stricker, who's listed on Lato's Web site as part of the Medical Advisory Board. Dr. RAFAEL STRICKER (Internist): What we hear from these patients is that they've often gone to, you know, 10, 20 physicians who all pretty much, you know, turn up their noses and say oh, you know, I don't know what this is, therefore its nothing. And a lot of these patients, you know, basically gave up after a while. They just said, look, I'm going to get the same story from every doctor I go to. So why bother? And they would just suffer in silence. And now, through the Internet, and this is not just true of Morgellons, it's true of other diseases. You can find physicians who are more sympathetic to these types of problems, and who can take care of these patients. NEIGHMOND: Stricker says patients fly from all over the country to see him or his partner, a nurse practitioner who's treating 200 patients who believe they have Morgellons. Stricker says there's no cure, but cycles of antibiotics and drugs to kill parasites seem to help. CDC officials say the agency has been hearing about this problems for years now, but clearly, people going on the Internet has made things happen faster. Lato's Web site called on patients to write their members of Congress. Members of Congress wrote the CDC and the CDC started an investigation. CDC officials say the Internet is a double-edged sword, offering some good information, but a lot that's simply not credible. Dermatologist Mark Horowitz couldn't agree more. He says he's never seen evidence of fibers or parasites, but he's seen dozens of patients who believe they have them. To Horowitz, it's obvious the patients have been picking at themselves, creating the skin lesions. Horowitz says a description of their disorder is in the official manual of mental illnesses. Mr. MARK HOROWITZ: The disease is what's classified as a delusional disorder or psychosis, often referred to now as Morgellons. But we believe that it's a biochemical imbalance in the brain that causes them to believe that they are infested with parasites. NEIGHMOND: Psychiatrist say the mental illness may be helped by anti-psychotic medication. But people who believe they have Morgellons, like Gail Anderson, don't believe they have delusions so they won't take the medication. And Horowitz says Web sites like Mary Lato's don't help. Mr. HOROWITZ: There's now a Morgellons society. And the problem is that when you go to their website, no where on there do they talk about that this could be a delusional disorder. And the problem with that is that you're reinforcing these people's belief, and preventing them from trying a medicine that will actually work for them. NEIGHMOND: CDC officials expect their investigation into what patients call Morgellons, to take about six months and cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. Patty Neighmond, NPR News.

I'm Farai Chideya. 'Tis the season to make promises to yourself. If you're like a lot of us, you're thinking about what you want out of the New Year. Maybe that's a home, a better job or a relationship. But what about improving your health? Taking care of our health is something that a lot of people put on a back burner. And that could mean illnesses that are best caught early, like prostate cancer and diabetes. They go untreated, especially in communities of color. One glaring example is AIDS, which can be treated but not cured. It's reported that the rate of HIV diagnoses for black adults and adolescents is 10 times the rate for whites. This year, a number of public service announcements, like this one from the 2006 Rap-It-Up Campaign, have addressed the issue. (Soundbite of Rap-It-Up Campaign ad) Unidentified Woman: My idea of HIV was a IV drug user or a gay man. I never thought that a straight heterosexual woman, you know, who was not promiscuous could get it. Every day, people are still getting infected. And every day, people are still dying. CHIDEYA: Now AIDS is just one of several illnesses we've taken a look at that effect African Americans more than other communities. Dr. Ivan Walks, a former chief health officer of the District of Columbia, recapped some of these issues with NPR's Tony Cox. TONY COX: HIV and AIDS. New studies this year show that young black adults are much more likely to be infected with an STD, including HIV/AIDS, than young white adults. Why is there still a spike in AIDS cases among blacks in this country? Dr. IVAN WALKS (Former Chief Health Officer, District of Columbia): Well, we have several issues. And I think one of them - and I want to make sure we highlight this - is that even though the incidence is higher among young blacks, it's higher still among young black women. And so we have to do a lot of education. We have to get past a lot of those cultural issues about not wanting to use protection, wanting things to be, quote, unquote, \"natural\" - a lot of the cultural things as well as a lack of real educational programs that are focused on reaching young African-Americans. We tend to speak differently, we tend to listen differently, and need to be communicated with differently. So I think that when we're looking at health disparity issues, how is that message about what should be done getting to the communities that need it the most? COX: Another silent killer in the black community is prostate cancer. And not long ago, we took a look at a new study that suggested that older men diagnosed with prostate cancer will live longer the earlier that they receive treatment. And this sort of flies in the face of the conventional wait-and-watch approach taken by many doctors. What should we keep in perspective here, do you think? Dr. WALKS: With almost any problem, early diagnosis and early intervention is the way to go, whether it's prostate or whether it's the plumbing in your home. If you are watchful and you're looking for things that could go wrong - and with prostate cancer, you want to make sure everyone age 50 over gets that prostate exam, gets in to see the doctor, and make it part of a routine physical. African-American men, in particular, have a problem with the prostate exam. And we need to make sure that people understand how important it is. And so whatever personal issue, whatever cultural issues there may be, they have to come second to the importance of maintaining good health. COX: We talked about cancer and we talked about black men. Let's talk about a disease that affects black women in high numbers, and that's breast cancer. An ongoing study from the University of Chicago that we highlighted this year suggests that women who do not have strong social support could be more prone to breast cancer. Talk to us about how social support plays a role in combating this disease. Dr. WALKS: Well, I think that social support in many ways helps folks to feel like they are more valued, that they are more important when they're interacting with other people. You sort of have a responsibility to hold up your end. You don't want to let others down. You don't want to be a burden on others. And so having social supports - one, you can have peer pressure, you can have groups that support each other, so that we know what, have you had your exam yet? Yeah, I've had my exam. Do you know how to do your exam? Let's talk about it. All of the kinds of things that positive peer pressure can do can actually be optimized with strong social supports. COX: Here's another. I've heard about this from my grandmother and mother, and others in my family. And I know that in black families around the country this is certainly a very common thing - high blood pressure and hypertension. One of the most talked about issues in health this year was the ongoing controversy around BiDil - the first drug approved by the FDA for use in a single racial group. What are your thoughts about this issue, doctor? Dr. WALKS: In looking at that whole controversy, my thoughts were we have to do what works. And I think that on one side you don't want to walk in and have -for example, you go to the mechanic and they go, oh, it's a Chevy, it must be the transmission. So we automatically know what's wrong with you because you walk in and you're black. That's not where we want to go, but what we want to do is to recognize that people respond differently to medication and we've known that for years. And especially in the area of hypertension, African-American men tend to work and respond better with multiple medications, with different kinds of medications. And so this is just another tool in the toolbox so that we have options now. We don't have to say, well, we don't know if anything is going to help. Is it going to be a waste of time to go to the doctor? They don't have medications. They don't understand that being black makes it different. We do understand all of those things. We have medications that are more likely to be effective in this particular group. So let's get to the doctor, get the blood pressure checked, and get the right medication. COX: Here's another one, Doctor - diabetes. You hear that a great deal. Some people called it sugar in the old days. What should we be doing with regard to protecting ourselves from this? Dr. WALKS: When we talk about diabetes, we really should not talk about it without talking about obesity and talking about general positive approaches to maintaining good health. Diabetes is something that, for the most part, occurs because of a certain lifestyle, because of a certain kind of food intake, because of a certain kind of approach to exercise or the lack thereof. Diabetes is such a huge killer in the African-American community in particular, and disproportionately. And it destroys everything. It destroys our nervous system. It takes our eyesight. It just kills us slowly and it kills us horribly. And I don't want to talk about it in any nicer term than that because it is so preventable. If we are really focused on this illness and we understand how dangerous it is to let ourselves and our children be overweight and stay overweight, to let our children play videogames all day and not go outside and play and get that exercise that's needed - if we continue to do those things, diabetes is not a nice disease. COX: Dr. Walks, in the summer we took a closer look at how many veterans suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder and drug addiction. We also know that according to health advocates, many warning signs that lead to suicide have a tendency to go unnoticed among young men of color. With regard to mental illness, are we making advances, enough advances? Dr. WALKS: We are making some advances. Are we making enough? Absolutely not. We have huge disparities across cultures with respect to mental illness and the approach to treating mental illness. And it's an area that is such a taboo, particularly within the African-American community. For example, with all the money we're spending on preparedness and on terrorism, and what have you, after a disaster, the longest need stretching out many, many years after Oklahoma City, September 11th, Hurricane Andrew, Hurricane Katrina - all of those issues are going to be mental health concerns. And we have to understand that it's OK to ask for help, and it's OK for your loved one to need to get help. This stigma against the seeking of help for mental illness, mental disease - and then the self-medicating with substances, with drugs and alcohol, that can also lead to domestic violence - increases all of the kinds of problems that result from untreated mental health problems, are huge in our community and we really need to talk about this more and get people the help they need. But the problem is a lot of resources are not available in our communities. So we need to let people know that they should get help, but we also need to ensure that help is available. COX: Dr. Walks, two more areas I'd like to address with you. The first is this. We hear a lot about baby boomers, the generation going now into the sixties and beyond. But black baby boomers, are we more susceptible to disease than others as we age? Dr. WALKS: We have a higher disease burden as we age because of all of the things that we routinely talk about. The higher incidence of diabetes, different kinds of cancer - breast cancer, prostate cancer - the higher incidence of HIV, all of those things are impacting our community differently. So as a large part of our population ages, we are going to see more and more of those issues come up. COX: On the flipside of that, talk about pediatrics, if you can, and whether or not our children are getting the kind of healthcare that they should be getting. Dr. WALKS: One of the most underused opportunities in healthcare in America is something called Early Periodic Screening Diagnosis and Treatment. It's a federal program that dollars often go unspent. We don't check our children when they're young. The immunizations are often not kept up to date. Those that live in parts of the Northeast where the housing stock is old and there's pre-1978 paint on the walls that's chipping - lead indigestion and lead poisoning, huge thing in young children. Asthma is a huge problem within the African-American community. We have a lot of diseases, environmental toxins like lead, impacting our children. Cigarette smoking and the second-hand smoke the children get. But if I had to pick one challenge that I would ask us to take on as a community with respect to our children, it's the obesity. Childhood obesity is going through the roof. Childhood diabetes is going through the roof. And the obesity impacts everything in a negative way. It impacts our health and it impacts the health of a child over their entire life. It's not - well, it's baby fat, and they'll be okay, they'll grow out of it. That's not the case. We know that the fat deposits can go into those arteries and begin to damage the long-term health at a very early age. The early and appropriate care that's needed is critical. One of the things that I want to make sure I made clear. In the United States of America, if you are deathly ill, you can get healthcare. You can go to an emergency room and you cannot legally be turned away. The challenge we have is how do we get people covered with health insurance and how do we get people early in preventive healthcare, because maintaining a healthy community is much less expensive in a number of ways, not just dollars, but socially in everything else, than trying to treat people when they don't have coverage and they need to be deathly ill before they can see a doctor. COX: Dr. Walks, this is some very important information. Thank you very much. Dr. WALKS: Happy New Year to you. It's always a pleasure to talk with you. COX: Same to you, Dr. Walks. Thanks again. Dr. COX: Take care. CHIDEYA: That was NPR's Tony Cox and Dr. Ivan Walks.

And especially in the area of hypertension, African-American men tend to work and respond better with multiple medications, with different kinds of medications.  And so this is just another tool in the toolbox so that we have options now. We don't have to say, well, we don't know if anything is going to help. Is it going to be a waste of time to go to the doctor? They don't have medications. They don't understand that being black makes it different.  We do understand all of those things. We have medications that are more likely to be effective in this particular group. So let's get to the doctor, get the blood pressure checked, and get the right medication.  COX: Here's another one, Doctor - diabetes. You hear that a great deal. Some people called it sugar in the old days. What should we be doing with regard to protecting ourselves from this?  Dr. WALKS: When we talk about diabetes, we really should not talk about it without talking about obesity and talking about general positive approaches to maintaining good health. Diabetes is something that, for the most part, occurs because of a certain lifestyle, because of a certain kind of food intake, because of a certain kind of approach to exercise or the lack thereof.  Diabetes is such a huge killer in the African-American community in particular, and disproportionately. And it destroys everything. It destroys our nervous system. It takes our eyesight. It just kills us slowly and it kills us horribly. And I don't want to talk about it in any nicer term than that because it is so preventable.  If we are really focused on this illness and we understand how dangerous it is to let ourselves and our children be overweight and stay overweight, to let our children play videogames all day and not go outside and play and get that exercise that's needed - if we continue to do those things, diabetes is not a nice disease.  COX: Dr. Walks, in the summer we took a closer look at how many veterans suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder and drug addiction. We also know that according to health advocates, many warning signs that lead to suicide have a tendency to go unnoticed among young men of color.  With regard to mental illness, are we making advances, enough advances?  Dr. WALKS: We are making some advances. Are we making enough? Absolutely not. We have huge disparities across cultures with respect to mental illness and the approach to treating mental illness. And it's an area that is such a taboo, particularly within the African-American community.  For example, with all the money we're spending on preparedness and on terrorism, and what have you, after a disaster, the longest need stretching out many, many years after Oklahoma City, September 11th, Hurricane Andrew, Hurricane Katrina - all of those issues are going to be mental health concerns.  And we have to understand that it's OK to ask for help, and it's OK for your loved one to need to get help. This stigma against the seeking of help for mental illness, mental disease - and then the self-medicating with substances, with drugs and alcohol, that can also lead to domestic violence - increases all of the kinds of problems that result from untreated mental health problems, are huge in our community and we really need to talk about this more and get people the help they need. But the problem is a lot of resources are not available in our communities. So we need to let people know that they should get help, but we also need to ensure that help is available.  COX: Dr. Walks, two more areas I'd like to address with you. The first is this. We hear a lot about baby boomers, the generation going now into the sixties and beyond. But black baby boomers, are we more susceptible to disease than others as we age?  Dr. WALKS: We have a higher disease burden as we age because of all of the things that we routinely talk about. The higher incidence of diabetes, different kinds of cancer - breast cancer, prostate cancer - the higher incidence of HIV, all of those things are impacting our community differently. So as a large part of our population ages, we are going to see more and more of those issues come up.  COX: On the flipside of that, talk about pediatrics, if you can, and whether or not our children are getting the kind of healthcare that they should be getting.  Dr. WALKS: One of the most underused opportunities in healthcare in America is something called Early Periodic Screening Diagnosis and Treatment. It's a federal program that dollars often go unspent. We don't check our children when they're young. The immunizations are often not kept up to date. Those that live in parts of the Northeast where the housing stock is old and there's pre-1978 paint on the walls that's chipping - lead indigestion and lead poisoning, huge thing in young children. Asthma is a huge problem within the African-American community. We have a lot of diseases, environmental toxins like lead, impacting our children. Cigarette smoking and the second-hand smoke the children get.  But if I had to pick one challenge that I would ask us to take on as a community with respect to our children, it's the obesity. Childhood obesity is going through the roof. Childhood diabetes is going through the roof. And the obesity impacts everything in a negative way. It impacts our health and it impacts the health of a child over their entire life. It's not - well, it's baby fat, and they'll be okay, they'll grow out of it. That's not the case. We know that the fat deposits can go into those arteries and begin to damage the long-term health at a very early age. The early and appropriate care that's needed is critical.  One of the things that I want to make sure I made clear. In the United States of America, if you are deathly ill, you can get healthcare. You can go to an emergency room and you cannot legally be turned away. The challenge we have is how do we get people covered with health insurance and how do we get people early in preventive healthcare, because maintaining a healthy community is much less expensive in a number of ways, not just dollars, but socially in everything else, than trying to treat people when they don't have coverage and they need to be deathly ill before they can see a doctor.  COX: Dr. Walks, this is some very important information. Thank you very much.  Dr. WALKS: Happy New Year to you. It's always a pleasure to talk with you.  COX: Same to you, Dr. Walks. Thanks again.  Dr. COX: Take care.  CHIDEYA: That was NPR's Tony Cox and Dr. Ivan Walks.

Bruce Goodwin runs the nuclear weapons program at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California. The two labs are longtime rivals. BRUCE GOODWIN: We took a somewhat different philosophy here.

KESTENBAUM: High margin means conservatively engineered, like a bridge that's been built far more strongly than it needs to be. GOODWIN: Some might say that this is a role reversal. Livermore was typically characterized as the cutting edge, you know, push-the-envelope laboratory. Los Alamos was very often characterized as the more conservative. KESTENBAUM: The designs are being judged on several criteria: simple manufacturing is a plus. A simple bomb can have hundreds of parts, a complex one, thousands. GOODWIN: We very carefully chosen certain technologies from the past that, you know, for instance, eliminate entire production lines. In one case there's one particular production line that's a mile long that, if the California design is selected, can be closed. KESTENBAUM: The new warheads are also meant to be green, to the extent that that's possible, with a minimum of toxic components. GOODWIN: We're basically left with nothing more than plutonium and uranium and nothing else. And the weapon is toxic or hazardous, which is a huge change from the Cold War stockpile. KESTENBAUM: The new warheads must also use what are known as insensitive explosives. The explosives compress the nuclear material and start the bomb going. Insensitive explosives are already used in some warheads and they're virtually impossible to trigger accidentally. Here's Charles McMillan from Los Alamos. MCMILLAN: They're practically like blocks of wood. You could shot a bullet into them and they don't go off. You throw them in a fire and they just burn. They're very attractive from a safety perspective. KESTENBAUM: And one more thing: During the Cold War, the U. S. wasn't terribly worried about the enemy stealing our warheads. Bruce Goodwin says terrorism has changed that. Existing warheads do have protections, but he says they can be improved. GOODWIN: I'm talking about a weapon that utterly disables itself so that even if you steal it, it's no use to you. KESTENBAUM: The deciding body in this competition - the Nuclear Weapons Council - had hoped to pick a winner in November. It's taking longer. Why? I asked Linton Brooks, administrator of the National Nuclear Security Administration in the Department of Energy, which oversees the weapons complex.

I'm Ira Flatow. You know, this year saw no shortage of science, medicine and technology news, and much of it was on the front pages of your local newspapers. Here are just some of the stories. I'm running down just a few of them. There's so many from the past year. Remember, there's the global warming stories, and probably the biggest global warming story is the publication of the Al Gore's best-selling book, \u201cAn Inconvenient Truth,\u201d which hit the silver screen in May and it was also a bestseller on The New York Times list. New studies were projecting that, by the year 2040, the summer ice in the Arctic Ocean would be a thing of the past. And we just heard this week, the U. S. Department - the U. S. government put the polar bear on the endangered species list, or is thinking about it. Even without listing it, it may go the way of the Dodo. So the polar bear is endangered whether we want to officially call it that or not. In anthropology we have researchers able to actually pluck DNA from Neanderthal fossils and then analyze the DNA and sequence set, hopefully answering some of the questions about the connection between Neanderthals and modern humans. We had E-coli outbreaks and bacterial outbreaks of other types that left scientists struggling to identify the sources of tainted food. The public is left wondering when they look at their salad at the salad bar now whether their food supply is safe. We had a paralyzed man equipped with a brain sensor who was able to open e-mail and move a robotic hand simply by thinking about it - very interesting story. We had the first ever cancer vaccine, which was approved. It protects women and girls from the infections from the human papillomavirus, which causes most cases of cervical cancer. And one of my favorite stories is that the state of Texas passed California as the king of wind energy, completing a trend that was set in place by none other than Texas governor George W. Bush, who does not, you know, rank wind energy as high on his list of things for the country while he did it as a governor. It's interesting. This hour we're going to review a lot of these stories, a lot of the top science, medical and technology stories of the year. We'll hear why the solution of a long-standing math problem grabbed top honors as a breakthrough of the year at Science magazine. And we'll also talk about some of the infamous stories, like the South Korean cloning scandal that was the breakdown of the year. So what stories topped your lists? Give us a call, 1-800-989-8255. Maybe we're going to miss one. I'm sure there are lots of stories, we can't cover them all, maybe the seminal one that you think we should put on that list that you're not hearing us talking about. Maybe one flaw under the radar on this. And you can always surf over to our Web site at ScienceFriday. com. Our phone number is 1-800-989-8255. 1-800-989-TALK. We have an august panel of commentators, so august we may go into September on this. I'm sorry about that one. John Rennie is the editor in chief at Scientific American here in New York, and he joins us here in our SCIENCE FRIDAY studios in New York. Welcome back, John, good to see you. Barron H. Lerner, Dr. Lerner is the author of \u201cWhen Illness Goes Public: Celebrity Patients and How We Look at Medicine. \u201d It's published this year from Johns Hopkins University Press. He is professor of medicine and public health at Columbia University's Medical Center, Mailman's School of Public Health here in New York, a very famous place. He joins us today in our studios here in New York. Welcome to the program, Dr. Lerner. Dr. BARRON LERNER (Author, \u201cWhen Illness Goes Public: Celebrity Patients and How We Look at Medicine\u201d): Thank you. FLATOW: K. C. Cole is a science commentator for KPCC in Pasadena. She's a visiting professor of journalism at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles. She's probably one of the great translators of physics. And I'm very happy to have K. C. back, joining us from KCRW in Santa Monica. Good to talk to you again, K. C. Adam Rogers is a senior editor at Wired Magazine in San Francisco and correspondent for the upcoming PBS television show \u201cWired Science. \u201d He joins us today by phone from  - I'm sure, it's a vacation locale with plenty of screaming children and relatives - in Royal Grande, California. Thanks for being with us, Adam. Mr. ADAM ROGERS (Senior Editor, Wired magazine): Thank you for pegging my mother-in-law's house perfectly accurately. (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: Well, let's give you a shot before, you know, people will get aware that you're on the radio. Tell us what would be one of your top picks, Adam, of this year? Mr. ROGERS: Well, I guess I'll voice some of the tech stuff first just to give props to the wired side and talk a little bit about Google and YouTube. I'm not trying to make that into a business story, but I do think that it's important and interesting for the future of the Internet that the king of searching for stuff on the Internet has now purchased the king of watching little bits of video on the Internet. I think that presages a total change in the way people consume television and media. And I think it presages what's going to happen in the Internet the next year, too, assuming Google can figure out some key technological issues. FLATOW: Are you saying we're seeing the death of TV, this year might mark that as we know it? Mr. ROGERS: Well, I do think it is a bit of a, you know, television is dead, long live television. I think people are - I think what we're seeing with things like YouTube and other places to watch short squibs of video online is that nobody any longer wants to sit in front of the television at a specific place for a specific time. TiVo means the same thing, right? All of the sort of time shifting that we can do now includes media shifting or medium shifting, I guess, from television to the computer to iPod, to whatever you want to watch it on; and in shorter bytes, not just a half hour or an hour. And with people making their own. I mean the key thing about YouTube, of course, is not just being able to watch, you know, Star Wars kids playing with, you know, special effect light sabers or watching bits of the Jon Stewart show from the night before, being able to put your own videos on it too. So, you know, people making their own television. I don't want to give too much of a shout out to another magazine, but I think that some of what Time meant when they put - when they made you the person of the year, that's the sort of crowd sourcing of content on the Internet. It's something we saw more and more of this year, and I think we're going to see more and more next year. People making their own stuff and that being with television that people consume via YouTube, via Google, right? FLATOW: Now what is the big deal of Google taking that over? Mr. ROGERS: Well, I think what interests me about it - and like I said, the business stuff I don't particularly care too much about - what interests me is that, you know, right now if you're going to search for something, you Google it, right? It is a verb the same way that, when we copy things, we Xerox them. It is the default search engine for the Web. But the one thing that nobody really knows how to do online is search for video. You can search for sort of tags on video. You can search for things that people have told you the video is about, right? But there's no way to search for - I want to see pictures of the following. And my kind of sort of prediction, sort of hope, sort of guess, is that if anybody is going to be able to figure out how to search video, it's Google. FLATOW: Interesting. John, give us one of your top picks. Mr. JOHN RENNIE (Editor in Chief, Scientific American): I think probably - from a scientific American standpoint, probably the most important story overall was the one you were referring that falls under the general heading of what's been learned about global warming and developments in that area. Looking back over this past year, it's not that there was any one particular story that most stood out. It's the continuing trend of - obviously - the ongoing validation that global warming is a very real problem, that it is one caused in no small way by what human activity is doing, by putting more greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere. And the fact that some of the political standpoint that, unfortunately, the United States has really not shown the kind of leadership that it should in dealing with this problems seriously. FLATOW: So the story is just that this is - would you say that the U. S. has finally bought on to this now, or are we still\u2026 Mr. RENNIE: You know, it's funny. What we're seeing is an incremental buy-in to this. The very encouraging things that happened this past year, for example, were, as you mentioned, Al Gore's movie \u201cAn Inconvenient Truth. \u201d I think that helped to convince a lot more people who'd maybe been on the sense previously that global warming is a very real problem, that something has to be done about it. You know, maybe that's one of those sort of tipping point phenomenon. Another one I think is that we're starting to see the business community is starting to respond. We mentioned at end of year we have our own Scientific American 50 list in which we're acknowledging different technology leaders. And our business leader of the year was actually the Swiss reinsurance company, Swiss Re, because they have been encouraging a lot of the business community to try to factor global warming strategies into their long-term planning. But I think we can even see some sorts of movement at least even within the administration. If nothing else, the fact that the Interior Department now seems to be willing to recognize that polar bears are endangered by the loss of their Arctic habitat. FLATOW: K. C. Cole, what have you got on your list? Professor K. C. COLE (Journalism, University of Southern California): Well, in terms of physics, I would say mostly things that haven't been covered very much. I was surprised that there's so little being said about the preparations for the Large Hadron Collider, the LHC, that will become the world's most powerful particle accelerator either this year or next. What's happening is people are trying to figure out what could possibly be seen, extra dimensions begin one of them, new families of particles being another, all kinds of exotic stuff. Mini black holes. If you don't really work out what you might see and what the signature of it would be, then you won't see it if it's not right in front of your nose. So a lot of it has been about clever new ways of actually looking for invisible things. In math, of course, as he said, I was delighted to see that science put Poincare Conjecture as number one. What I find fascinating about this is that there are all these problems in math that can be solved in dimensions one and two, and Dimensions five or higher. If you want to tie a nine dimensional not in a ten dimensional space - no problem. But Dimensions three and four are very, very complicated and there are these whole class of problems that haven't been solved. So this was quite an important breakthrough. Of course, important for us in a way because we live in three dimensions - four-dimensional space time - and so there's a lot of overlap between math and physics in these areas. And I can say more about this if you'd like but. . . FLATOW: It was so important that it was made the number one story. I think it's hard for the public to understand how important that might be, that of all stories that one was chosen. Why was that? Can you give us a little more of that flavor? Prof. COLE: Well, there are a lot of things, you know, that are fairly typical of the way things happen in math, and also science in general. Somebody finds a solution to a problem, whereas other people have found pieces of before and then puts it together in a unique way that eventually everyone looks at and says, yeah, well of course. Let me just state what simply the problem is that he solved. If you're living in a certain kind of space, basically, how do you know what its shape is? And by shape I don't mean geometric shape, but shape - does it have holes in it. You know, they joke that a topologist someone who doesn't know the difference between a doughnut and a coffee cup, which is true because the only thing that matters is that it has one hole. So you're basically defining families of kinds of objects in space, just like biologists do. Mathematicians do basically the same thing in terms of classifying. FLATOW: K. C. , I want you to hold that question because we've got to take a break and I want to get to the - you know, give you time to tell us what that question was. And we'll be back. As I said, we'll be back with all our guests talking about the big science, math, technology stories of the year. Also bring on our other guests to give us their ideas. Stay with us. We'll be right back after this short break. I'm Ira Flatow. This is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. (Soundbite of music) FLATOW: You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow. We're talking about the top science, health, medicine, technology, mathematics, you know, stories of 2006. I'm running them down with my guests John Rennie, Barron Lerner, K. C. Cole and Adam Rogers. Our number: 1-800-989-8255. And when I rudely interrupted K. C. , as I want to do to all of my guests, she was explaining why the top prize for this year in Science magazine was a mathematics prize. You were about to tell us the significance. Prof. COLE: OK, what I was trying to explain was that this gave you a way of basically figuring out what kind of topological space you live in even though you're embedded in it, which is a very difficult thing to do. You might ask what possible practical application this kind of thing could have. Well, as usual, it's a lot of the tools that were developed leading up to it will become very important. For example, they teach us things about singularities, you know those nasty things at the parts of black holes that pinch off space time, and they pop up as problems all over the place in statistics and math. So this is actually giving a way to figure out whether or not they're there. Basically, you imagine a space. If it's a sphere, you can tie a string around it and pull it closed and you won't encounter any resistance. If it's got a hole in it and you do the same thing - you pull the string, it will knot. It will get stuck. And so it's a mathematical way of seeing the topology of the space that you are living in. FLATOW: Thank you. Barron Lerner, what would be your pick? Dr. LERNER: I guess one story that you didn't mention was surrounding breast cancer. And interestingly this year, the rates of breast cancer for the last year that we have data, which is 2003, showed a major drop of seven percent of the new cases of the disease. And this was very striking because for years and years - for reasons that people couldn't explain - that rate of breast cancer was either staying the same or creeping up. And there were a lot of different hypotheses as to why that was happening, and then all of a sudden we see this very significant seven percent drop. And now it's being speculated that the reason for that is that women stopped taking hormone replacement therapy because of all the negative publicity about that. So that was very, very striking because this would suggest that for years and years it was the medicine that was being given to treat the symptoms of menopause that indeed was causing more harm than good. FLATOW: But it was certainly good news. I mean, what, they said 40,000 deaths were averted. Dr. LERNER: Exactly. I mean it's very exciting news. And one would expect that this decline would continue because more and more women have gotten off hormone replacement therapy based on the study results. FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255. Let's go to the phones and get some listeners in. Tony in Nevada City, California. Hi, Tony. TONY (Caller): Good morning. Yeah, it's a great show. I have it on the pod and listen to you as often as I can. So one of the things that I don't think you covered this year was the imaging of dark matter. And you can see a great picture of this at a site called BadAstronomy. com, and they did it through the use of gravitic lenses. FLATOW: Yeah, it was the collision of two - like the bullet picture I think it was called. Right, K. C. ? TONY: Yeah. Prof. COLE: Right. Yeah, and that's another great example of people being clever about how to figure out how to see something that you can't see - dark matter being essentially transparent, so it doesn't interact with anything. So, you know, they figured out, well, if two galaxies collide, the way that the matter clumps with each other is going to be different than the way the dark matter does and therefore it will be distributed differently. And bingo, they went out and looked for it and they found it. FLATOW: That's interesting. John, one of the biggest stories of the year - I mean we think - don't think about it, but we remember that Pluto getting kicked out of the planetary lineup. Mr. RENNIE: Right. But, you know, Tony, this is probably in many respects not the biggest or most important science story in a lot of ways, but it probably grabbed the public's imagination more than almost anything else. And it is a development that actually does have some real scientific importance to it. You know, there's been this question for quite some time when we were looking at Pluto as a sort of very small, oddball planet out sort of towards the edge of the solar system and the question of should it really be a planet. And it's position has been steadily undermined by the discovery of more and more things out in the Kuiper Belt, the ring of icy bodies out - farther out in the solar system, some of which are actually even larger than Pluto. So the decision was that this should actually be sort of relegated to a kind of a dwarf planet status. And I'll take the maybe publicly unpopular opinion. I think they made the right call on this. Because I think in terms of what we actually know these days about the science of how planets form, demoting Pluto is actually more in keeping with that science even though it's a very sentimentally unpopular position to take. TONY: Hopefully, this will teach Pluto not to miss meetings. (Soundbite of laughter) Prof. COLE: I would like to offer, yeah, a counterargument, if I can. This business of re-categorizing things and renaming them - I mean historically we have so many silly names. We call electrons - we say they have negative charge even though it's a positive presence of some things just because people didn't understand at first that this was a presence instead of an absence. We draw these lines. Objects out in space come in a complete continuous spectrum of sizes and it's very difficult to tell sometimes whether you're dealing with a planet, a failed star. I mean they're not these clear lines. And when we put them out there, we imagine - it reminds me a little of that old Arthur Eddington joke where the astronomer gives a talk to a lay audience about stars and somebody asks him after, well, I understood how you find out about the temperatures of stars and how you find out how hot they were and so forth. One thing I didn't understand. What's that, he says. Well, how did you find out their names? (Soundbite of laughter) Prof. COLE: In a way, that's what we're doing. TONY: Nomenclature was a big story this year in a lot of places, right? Didn't the medical and biomedical community got busted for coming up with silly names for genes because now they're having medical applications as well, and nobody wants to tell a patient that they have a problem with their Sonic the Hedgehog gene? FLATOW: No one beats physicists with silly names. (Unintelligible) all this kind of stuff like that. 1-800-989 - no, go ahead - 8255 is our number. Let's go to Wayne(ph) in Flagstaff. Hi, Wayne. WAYNE (Caller): Hey, how you doing? FLATOW: Hi there. WAYNE: Good. You might think being from Flagstaff, Arizona, that my top story would be Pluto being demoted. But here in Flagstaff, Pluto will always remain a planet. FLATOW: There you go. WAYNE: My top story, believe it or not, was the decision by New York City to outlaw trans fats. And of course all science stories are important, but for some reason this really captures my imagination and my interest. And I just love seeing it when entities like a city like New York, or even a country like Denmark, completely outlaw things that only serve to benefit financially corporations. But everybody knows that trans fats and things like that are bad for us. And that really captured my attention this year. FLATOW: Barron? Dr. LERNER: That was quite a story, and it's still an ongoing one. It really speaks to the degree to which we as a country want public health officials to be very aggressive about telling us what to do or what not to do. I think in this case it's a definite positive advance because trans fats, it turns out, really do not much of any good for anybody and do a lot of harm. There were some very important studies on monkeys this year that just showed a small amount of trans fat caused arterial plaque buildup and other problems. So if we want public health officials who are going to be very aggressive and take on business and take on people who want a more libertarian approach, we're going to see more and more things like this in the future. FLATOW: Thanks for calling. Prof. COLE: (Unintelligible) ban smoking. Sorry. FLATOW: Yeah. 1-800-989-8255 is our number. We're talking about the top stories of 2006. Adam, what about all these videogames and the, you know, and then the melding of - I was fortunate enough to get a Wii for the holidays. Mr. ROGERS: Did you wait in line for it or did you. . . FLATOW: No, I had an inside-the-store connection - my cousin's girlfriend - my nephew's girlfriend, so to speak. Mr. ROGERS: That's always good. FLATOW: I'm addicted to it now because it's so different. And now I notice that there's a WiFi connection that allows me to go to the Web through my Wii, and will allow me to play things with other people on the Web and download other things like - it seems like they want a piece of what Apple seems to want, which is making that one device that's going to combine all the media. Mr. ROGERS: First of all, let me just say you're doomed now. You're never leaving the house again. Get a replacement host. You're in trouble. FLATOW: I'm only on level one of \u201cZelda,\u201d so I'm pretty well intact, you know. Mr. ROGERS: Here's what fascinates me about the Wii. So the Wii is the new Nintendo system. It's this very small little white box. It looks very much like an Apple design, right? It's a little kind of white thing, sits very prettily, glows blue next to your television. This is the first gaming system - I'm not a huge gamer, but we got one in the office and I went in and tried it out. It's the first one that I seen that made me think this is the thing that adults will take out at parties. This is a system that is designed to be - not to be used by sort of a, you know \u201cHalo\u201d obsessive, you know, who's going to sit in front of a really, really high-end $600 system, like what the Playstation 3 is, and try to be there for hours and hours and really gawk at how great the cinematic quality of the graphics and, you know, how great the blood explosions look because of the new physics engine. This is a system where - you know, the game that I tried out was the tennis game. FLATOW: I love the tennis game. Mr. ROGERS: It's fantastic. And on the Wii the graphics are very cartoonish, intentionally so, because it's simple, right?  But the controllers are motion sensitive and wireless. So you stand there and you play tennis as if the controller was your racket. You flick your wrist to hit a ball. And it's really compelling. I mean it's like Tetris compelling because it's really fun. And you sort of stand there with another person standing next to you, and you're making kind of charades-like gesticulations and trying to get this, trying to win a doubles tennis match. It really was kind of a journey back to simplicity for video games, for computer games, which is totally the opposite direction that most gamers - most game systems, most game software makers are headed. You know, it's almost like the difference between the Airbus A-380, the giant, you know, double-decker, 600 people, flies around the world, and Boeing's little 787. That's a smaller plane, more efficient, bigger windows and sort of a nicer experience. The Wii is just a really pleasant experience as a game. And that's - it's something that, as people get more and more serious about the games, I have a suspicion that they get less fun. The Wii is actually more fun. FLATOW: You actually hold all the sports equipment like you do in real life. I mean it's a little - the controller, they show you how to hold it in the golf game. You have to hold it like a golf club, stand sideways to the screen, and swing, like, the club. And someone imitates it on the screen. Mr. ROGERS: Bend your knees, keep your back straight\u2026 FLATOW: Yeah. And, you know, it's just - baseball it's as hard as somebody throwing in 95-mile-an-hour baseball, actually, when you don't have to hold the thing like a bat. So you really, I think, as you say, you actually are part of the game instead of just using your thumb to manipulate it like you do in the other controllers. It's just quite amazing. Mr. ROGERS: This is such an important thing that's going on now with the kind of computers and the online - I think this year was really the first year where you could seriously talk about online worlds and not the be totally geeking out. I mean places like \u201cEverQuest\u201d and \u201cWorld of Warcraft\u201d and \u201cSecond Life\u201d and \u201cThe Sims\u201d all really became places people go just as much as San Luis Obispo is a place that people go. FLATOW: Yeah. Mr. ROGERS: And that's a profound change in the way people I think interact with each other, and sort of think about themselves and their own personalities and where they are in space and time. FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255 is our number. Another, I guess, watershed event, K. C. , that happened is this political situation, how that affected science this year. And now the switch possibly, because the Democrats are coming back into power. Prof. COLE: I'm glad you brought that up. I was afraid to because I know the last time I was on I talked about that a lot. But, yeah, what's interesting is it's finally gotten to the point where the scientists are fighting back and saying, enough manipulation, enough wasted money going in really silly programs like the moon to Mars mission, for example, which is just devastating many, many other fields. And they are getting politicized. They found this - founded the Scientists and Engineers for America, an organization that's actually raising money to run advertising supporting candidates in various fields. Because, you know, it's gotten to that tipping point where people just could not stand anymore the fact that science does not seem to have an ear these days in Washington. FLATOW: John Rennie, do you agree? Mr. RENNIE: Oh, absolutely. I mean I think it's - what's unfortunate is that, because the scientists have now had to get sucked into a political process where they have to speak up to defend what should be rational courses of action and the rational interpretation of the scientific findings, it's that unfortunately it does make it possible for people who oppose some of the sorts of actions they'd like to see - for example, global warming deniers and the like - to be able to maintain that scientists themselves just represent their own kind of interest group, their own lobby. And that I think does - it's a kind of - has a very corrosive effect on the way that the public views science. And there's going to be a lot of damage that's been done by the people who've been opposing this. FLATOW: Talking about the top stories in science this hour in TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. Hi, Barron, you want to jump it? Dr. LERNER: Yeah, I just was going to echo that in the world of medicine when Michael J. Fox wound up doing political ads in favor of candidates who were doing stem cell research because of his Parkinson's disease - and that was another very interesting mixture of politics and science where, you know, I think Michael J. Fox was out there as a Parkinson's patient first and foremost saying, I want to scientists to be able to explore whatever they can. But at least the folks on the Republican side assumed that this was all a political ploy, which I really think it wasn't. FLATOW: We also saw the states scientifically taking on the federal government. Dr. LERNER: Right. I think, you know, this is an interesting point that the caller who was mentioning the way that New York City was taking action on its own with trans fats. I think it's been very interesting to see the counter reaction to that that you've seen, for example, California trying to take leadership on both stem cell research and also in global warming by setting its own greenhouse gas emission standards. FLATOW: K. C. ? Prof. COLE: Well, I was going to say one of the most dangerous places, what you might call faith-based science, has been affecting us is in terms of national security. And we're spending billions and billions of dollars on a missile defense system which virtually, you know, a very tiny percentage of the physics community even think could possibly work. But just in terms of general reports that scientific organizations have come out with telling us what makes sense to do is not what we're doing in almost every case. We're just not basing these decisions on how to spend dollars in any rational, sane way. In fact, even trans fats - I mean I was when I was joking about the cigarettes - but even the dangers we tend to go after in the medical field a lot of times just don't make sense compared to other risk factors. It would be nice if we had a rational way of going out and really deciding what's dangerous and how to approach that. Mr. ROGERS: Well, you know\u2026 FLATOW: Go ahead. Mr. ROGERS: Ira, at the top of the show you mentioned some of the food safety stories that we've seen this year, and how, you know, people sort of get a little nervous in the salad bar because you don't know whether the food you're looking at has E. coli in it or something like that. And it just occurred to me that what we were told sort of publicly after the anthrax attacks in 2001 was that a new biosafety program, right - we were going to get really concerned about biological weapons being deployed against us, and that that was also going to help us deal with surveillance for food-based illnesses and figure out emerging diseases as well. And, you know, none of that happened, either. I think that gets at some of what K. C. was talking about, too. It's that, you know, that even when there's a veneer of rational decision-making or, you know, decisions made based on sort of an immediate panic that we hope will have ramifications that are positive if they go forward; we tend not to be able to make that happen somehow. We still can't figure out how to keep E. coli out of the food chain, you know. FLATOW: Yeah. We still have trouble making large decisions that will span decades, and moving large masses of bureaucracy and people. Well, we have to take a short break. We'll come back and talk lots more with K. C. Cole, Adam Rogers, John Rennie and Barron Lerner. So stay with us. We'll take - go right to the phones when we're back and take your calls, get your suggestions for the top science health, medicine, technology, mathematics - whatever I'm leaving out, you put in. Stay with us, we'll be right back. (Soundbite of music) FLATOW: I'm Ira Flatow, this is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. (Soundbite of music) FLATOW: You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow. We're talking this hour about the year's biggest science stories with my guests, K. C. Cole, science commentator for KPCC in Pasadena. Adam Rogers, senior editor of Wired magazine in San Francisco. John Rennie, editor in chief at Scientific American in New York. And Barron Lerner, author of \u201cWhen Illness Goes Public: Celebrity Patients And How We Look At Medicine. \u201d That's an interesting topic. We'll have to have you back and talk about that, because I think it's a truly interesting topic. 1-800-989-8255. Let's go to Barry in Boston. Hi, Barry. Barry(Caller): Hi, thank you for taking my call. Great show. FLATOW: Thank you. BARRY: My question is about physics, the year in physics. In previous recent years, I've gotten a lot of pressure from reading books about string theory, say, by Brian Greene. And it's really captured my imagination, putting together Einstein's gravity and quantum physics using a little tiny, teeny things. FLATOW: Right. Barry: This year, two books came out, I believe. One of them by Lee Smolin and I'm not sure of the other author, but it was titled \u201cNot Even Wrong. \u201d And you get from the title, books about string theory kind of debunking it or maybe saying it's barking up the wrong tree. What do the your physics (unintelligible) FLATOW: Yeah, it's come under a lot of - string theory's being hit left and right. Let me go to K. C. and then John, and then go to my panelists. K. C. , What do you think? Has it had its time and it's ran out? Prof. COLE: No. FLATOW: Has the string run out? Prof. COLE: No, it's a very difficult set of problems that they're working with. But these two books did make a very big splash. And I have to admit that I wrote one of the most negative reviews, as was the New York Times review. In that it is so easy to sit back and criticize - really, by people - the other author was Peter Voit who has a Web site, Not Even Wrong - by people who really aren't that much in the middle of it. Both of the books had a little bit of the flavor of I'm not invited to your meetings. I'm not in your club. Nobody is paying attention to my theories. You get the impression that you have to be an insider. The thing about string theory is that even string theorists will tell you nobody exactly knows what it is. It's a way of solving this incompatibility between gravity and the large-scale universe and the small-scale universe. But it had so many mathematical successes that most people are fairly convinced there is something there, even if they're not sure what. And what a lot of these books were also addressed at was basically poo-pooing math, as if, well, you know, it's just mathematics, just mathematics - which goes against the long history of math discovering real things, like anti-matter, for example. So lots is going on in string theory. It's just that these two books coming out at the same time with the same complaint did get a lot of press attention. FLATOW: John. BARRY: I keep reading about string theory. FLATOW: Well, these are not the first critics of string theory. Mr. RENNIE: No, that's right. I mean we'll continue to have a lot more in the future, you know. String theory is - it's the big one on the block. It's the theory currently that everybody would have to knock over - what they have to beat to come up with something that is a better theory. You know, I think string theory - it does, it has contributed a lot and there are legitimate questions of course about, you know, string theory. There are many, many different formulations - never questions - of how do you settle on what is the best one. But, really, somebody's got to come up with a theory that clearly works better than string theory does to be a serious critic. Mr. ROGERS: And so I'm not sure it's fair to criticize Smolin's book at least as being, you know, an outsider who just says, well I don't get to come to that party so they must all be jerks. I mean he had, you know, he had published in string theory. And also, that's a little bit - K. C. , that's a little bit of an ad homonym, right? I mean the substance of the book is very solid. Prof. COLE: Well, yeah. If you talk to string theorists, they would say that, throughout the book, the success of loop quantum gravity has been vastly exaggerated compared to string theory. I think one of his big complaints, which is something that bothers a lot of people in the physics community, is just what Ira mentioned - the fact that string theory has probably an infinite number of solutions. So you're left with the problem of, well, you know, is there a right solution? Why are we living in a universe that looks like this when it could look just about any other way? And several physicists have come out in favor of the anthropic principle, which I'm sure we must have talked about it before. The idea is that we live in the universe we do because, if it were any different, we couldn't live here. And that is very bothersome. And he really does have a legitimate point on that. FLATOW: All right, we're going to - we'll pick it up, Barry, later on because we love talking about string theory. Thanks a lot. 1-800-989-8255. Let's go to Palo Alto, where Stephanie is. Hi, Stephanie. STEPHANIE (Caller): Yes. Hello, good morning. FLATOW: Good morning. Good afternoon. STEPHANIE: I wonder if I can explain this nice and clearly. Diabetics who are dependant on several injections of insulin are now freed from the constant jabbings of the needle. This year, a new product was approved by the FDA and by the European authorities whereby the patients take insulin into their blood stream through the lungs, by inhaling the insulin. It took 15 years to develop this, or at least it took a great number of years to get the FDA to approve it because they were nervous about breathing this stuff in through the lungs, but it seems to have proved to be no problem at all. And so diabetics, who frequently postpone taking the insulin because they don't want to keep jabbing themselves, hopefully will start on the medication sooner, before they start having serious side effects from the diabetes. So we think that this is a very exciting new development. FLATOW: Dr. Lerner, do you want to comment? Dr. LERNER: Yeah. It is very exciting, although one of the interesting aspects of it is that patients have not embraced it - and I think physicians as well -as quickly as we might have imagined. And for years and years, for example, many of my patients have complained about the needles over and over again. And when I raised this, they were like oh, no, I wouldn't do that. FLATOW: Is that right? Why - what's the - because it's new? Dr. LERNER: Well, part of it it's new. There has been this discussion. It hasn't been around long enough. Are there possible long-term side effects in the lungs? And even though the FDA has been pretty reassuring about that, there are concerns. FLATOW: Stephanie, are you a diabetic? STEPHANIE: No, I'm not. Actually, I'm the mother of the man who developed it. FLATOW: Oh. STEPHANIE: Yeah. (Soundbite of laughter) Dr. LERNER: Full disclosure. Wait a minute\u2026 (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: Well, that's nice of his mom to come on. (Soundbite of laughter) STEPHANIE: Well, but I think that this is really an exciting thing. And it's going to take time, I understand from my son, to educate the patient population on the use of the product. And it has been in trials for quite a number of years, and so far there have not been any contra-indications, so it seems like a very exciting new technology. FLATOW: Well, you're a terrific\u2026 Dr. LERNER: I want my mom to call in. FLATOW: Yeah, you're a terrific mom. STEPHANIE: I'm a terrific mom. I'll tell my son. FLATOW: Tell him to give us a call, all right? (Soundbite of laughter) FLATOW: Thanks, Stephanie. Have a happy new year to you. STEPHANIE: Thank you. Same to you. Bye-bye. FLATOW: Bye. Another moment on SCIENCE FRIDAY. 1-800-989-8255 is our number. Let's go ahead to David(ph) in St. Paul, moving across the country. DAVID (Caller): Yeah, Ira, how are you doing? FLATOW: What kind of winter are you having this year? DAVID: It's (unintelligible), I'll tell you. It's about 40-some-odd degrees. It's kind of freezing, not-quite-freezing rain. There's no snow on the ground, at least in the Twin Cities. FLATOW: Wow. DAVID: So it's a very warm winter, actually. It's funny, you were talking about the Large Hadron Collider. I remember, I think when I was coming out of college, going in the military, they were considering building something called the Superconducting Super-Collider in Texas, which of course our government, in its infinite wisdom, decided to not fund. I'm eagerly awaiting the tune-up and then the final configuration, the bean(ph) configuration from the LHC. But my story, I guess, is something that - I guess it broke in the last couple of months, and that's the recent evidence for either contemporaneous or recent aboveground water flow on Mars. I think that that's\u2026 FLATOW: Those gullies, a picture of those gullies. DAVID: Yes, exactly. FLATOW: The stains on the gullies which had to be leftover mineral deposits in the water. DAVID: Right. FLATOW: Yeah, they were amazing. DAVID: That's something that I think is, I mean, there's going to be a lot of work on that going on. And the ramifications, of course, if they do confirm that there had been water flowing aboveground on Mars recently, I don't think those ramifications can be underestimated. Unidentified Man: Yeah, I mean, that is certainly - that is one of the most exciting sorts of planetary science discoveries of this past year. You know, any water that's flowing across the Martian surface is very short-lived. Mostly, any kind of water that's there near the surface is frozen. You may have something like permafrost, and you may get some periodic melting just below the surface, and then sort of an ice dam may break and you may see some sort of flow. It certainly is one more thing that reinforces the view we have that Mars was a much wetter planet at one time. I think everybody would love to be able to take the jump and say this must mean, then, that the odds for life in the past or maybe in at least some primitive form on Mars must still be pretty good. But we really don't know much about that, I mean even beyond just the impossible-to-peg probabilities associated with life on another planet, anyway. There's a very good possibility that, for example, the pH of that water may be way off. That water might be highly acidic, for example, too acidic to imagine that you would easily get life forms evolving in it. But that's something we'll find out about more over time. FLATOW: Thanks for calling, David. 1-800-989-8255. K. C. , did you want to say something? Prof. COLE: Yeah. I just wanted to say that it was interesting when I had actually been forwarded news reports about that and looked at them, and they basically said this has been discovered and the interpretation is that there was water recently flowing. But if you actually read what was said, it was that that was one very probable interpretation. So I think that's something you have to keep in mind. But also that, I mean, one of the really sad things about the way the budget priorities have been shuffled around at NASA is that if we're interested in looking for life, one, we should be funding astrobiology more; and they've been cut. I mean, those are the people who actually figure what life might be elsewhere and what it would look like. And also, you know, the Jupiter moon missions, where you have, you know, a pretty good chance. Europa's a pretty exciting place to go, more exciting I think than putting a man back on the moon. FLATOW: We're talking about science stories this hour, TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. Were those cut, all the Jupiter missions, K. C. ? Or were they - just some of them? Prof. COLE: (Unintelligible) they've been back and forth, Jupiter icy moon orbiter. They were gone, then they were back\u2026 FLATOW: Well, maybe the new Congress will have something to say about that. Prof. COLE: Yes. Yeah. I think they will. But in terms of what you can do in discovery, you can do so much more with robots. FLATOW: Just a few more minutes to go. Let's go to Jerry(ph) in Mountain View, California. Lots of Californians calling in today. Hi, Jerry. JERRY (Caller): Hi, how you doing? FLATOW: Hi. JERRY: The new electric cars that are coming up, like the Tesla car that has zero to 60 in four seconds and a 250-mile range with lithium ion batteries. And the big thing is really that the improvement of the lithium ion, which is your gas tank. The car has been around for a while, but the lithium ion is a big thing. FLATOW: Adam Rogers? Mr. ROGERS: Yeah. This is awesome, right? I mean, it's a little outside my price point. But the interesting thing about the electric motor, right, is that - and batteries like lithium ion batteries - is they have a bearing on sports cars in a few things. First of all, like, you know, you want a sports car with a low center of gravity that sort of, you know, sits low and is heavy to the ground. So that's perfect if you're going to load in, you know, a couple hundred lithium ion batteries, right? Then, one other that you want is low-end torque. Well, electric motors are really good at generating low-end torque, right? They spin up very quickly. FLATOW: You just have to ride a subway to know that. Mr. ROGERS: Yeah, exactly. And then get pushed back in your seat or lose your grip on the strap, right? FLATOW: Right. Mr. ROGERS: So, you know, all these things, especially when you add in, you know, venture capital billionaires and a lot of designers from Lotus, can produce a really nifty car which, you know, aside from just the - I grew up in Los Angeles, and so that means a lot to me right off. But it also does suggest, I think, a difference in approach, as John was talking about, an opinion about global warming and about green technology and climate change. That the idea now has become, look, this stuff is happening; what are we going to do about it? And that ranges from figuring out more-efficient photovoltaics to how do we build a really cool electric car. And I think the important thing is going to be, you know, to make sure the Tesla doesn't turn out to be DeLorean, right? I mean, put aside the drug-scandal thing - but to see if they actually build some other cars, too, that might actually be in my price range. FLATOW: Do you think that if more Silicon Valley engineers turned toward the automotive industry, things might change? Mr. ROGERS: Well, it's pretty to think so. I mean I would hope so. But I think that, you know, they thought that about space, too, right? And a lot of the Silicon Valley guys, including Elon Musk, who's also involved with the Tesla, right? Elon Musk made his money at PayPal, is involved with Tesla and also involved in a known space venture, SpaceX. I think that, you know, the success that they have with their companies starts to make them think that they might try something in another field, too. I would love to see more involvement by these kind of smart engineers in the automotive industry. But you already have a lot of smart engineers, right? I mean these folks are not constrained by their intelligence, they're constrained by some economics issues, I think, that maybe you start to overcome when the price of oil gets above $50 bucks a barrel, and photovoltaics get better, and lithium ion batteries get better, and, and, and. FLATOW: I have about one minute to go. I mentioned at the beginning there was the story that didn't happen, being the hurricane season that we thought might happen. Any other story, one story, come to mind, John, that didn't happen that surprised you that didn't happen this year? Mr. RENNIE: Yeah, I'll mention something. It was a story embedded inside a story that did get attention. There was a lot of headlines that went to the report that came out that suggested that, by 2048, we could basically collapse of all the ocean's fisheries. But the story that didn't really get the right attention inside there was the fact that that collapse was not just from over-fishing or pollution, it was partly just the fact that you were seeing the biodiversity of the ocean start to drop off. That, in itself, caused more extinction events. That's a very important ecological finding and something that's going to be very important when we look at the kind of consequences for the future. FLATOW: Well, I want to thank you all. K. C. - something in 15 seconds. You can jump in on that. Prof. COLE: Oh, just following on that, how many of the stories had ethical consequences that we need to consider, whether it's in terms of environment, nanotechnology, anything, yeah. FLATOW: We didn't even get into nanotechnology. I mean it's such a cutting-edge thing. We'll have to do this again soon. Thank you all for taking time to be with me today. K. C.

Thanks for taking time to be with us.  IRA FLATOW, host:  This is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow.  You know, this year saw no shortage of science, medicine and technology news, and much of it was on the front pages of your local newspapers. Here are just some of the stories. I'm running down just a few of them. There's so many from the past year.  Remember, there's the global warming stories, and probably the biggest global warming story is the publication of the Al Gore's best-selling book, \u201cAn Inconvenient Truth,\u201d which hit the silver screen in May and it was also a bestseller on The New York Times list.  New studies were projecting that, by the year 2040, the summer ice in the Arctic Ocean would be a thing of the past. And we just heard this week, the U. S. Department - the U. S. government put the polar bear on the endangered species list, or is thinking about it. Even without listing it, it may go the way of the Dodo. So the polar bear is endangered whether we want to officially call it that or not.  In anthropology we have researchers able to actually pluck DNA from Neanderthal fossils and then analyze the DNA and sequence set, hopefully answering some of the questions about the connection between Neanderthals and modern humans.  We had E-coli outbreaks and bacterial outbreaks of other types that left scientists struggling to identify the sources of tainted food. The public is left wondering when they look at their salad at the salad bar now whether their food supply is safe.  We had a paralyzed man equipped with a brain sensor who was able to open e-mail and move a robotic hand simply by thinking about it - very interesting story. We had the first ever cancer vaccine, which was approved. It protects women and girls from the infections from the human papillomavirus, which causes most cases of cervical cancer.  And one of my favorite stories is that the state of Texas passed California as the king of wind energy, completing a trend that was set in place by none other than Texas governor George W. Bush, who does not, you know, rank wind energy as high on his list of things for the country while he did it as a governor. It's interesting. This hour we're going to review a lot of these stories, a lot of the top science, medical and technology stories of the year.  We'll hear why the solution of a long-standing math problem grabbed top honors as a breakthrough of the year at Science magazine. And we'll also talk about some of the infamous stories, like the South Korean cloning scandal that was the breakdown of the year.  So what stories topped your lists? Give us a call, 1-800-989-8255. Maybe we're going to miss one. I'm sure there are lots of stories, we can't cover them all, maybe the seminal one that you think we should put on that list that you're not hearing us talking about. Maybe one flaw under the radar on this. And you can always surf over to our Web site at ScienceFriday. com. Our phone number is 1-800-989-8255. 1-800-989-TALK.  We have an august panel of commentators, so august we may go into September on this. I'm sorry about that one. John Rennie is the editor in chief at Scientific American here in New York, and he joins us here in our SCIENCE FRIDAY studios in New York. Welcome back, John, good to see you.  Barron H. Lerner, Dr. Lerner is the author of \u201cWhen Illness Goes Public: Celebrity Patients and How We Look at Medicine. \u201d It's published this year from Johns Hopkins University Press. He is professor of medicine and public health at Columbia University's Medical Center, Mailman's School of Public Health here in New York, a very famous place. He joins us today in our studios here in New York. Welcome to the program, Dr. Lerner.  Dr. BARRON LERNER (Author, \u201cWhen Illness Goes Public: Celebrity Patients and How We Look at Medicine\u201d): Thank you.  FLATOW: K. C. Cole is a science commentator for KPCC in Pasadena. She's a visiting professor of journalism at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles. She's probably one of the great translators of physics. And I'm very happy to have K. C. back, joining us from KCRW in Santa Monica. Good to talk to you again, K. C.  Adam Rogers is a senior editor at Wired Magazine in San Francisco and correspondent for the upcoming PBS television show \u201cWired Science. \u201d He joins us today by phone from  - I'm sure, it's a vacation locale with plenty of screaming children and relatives - in Royal Grande, California. Thanks for being with us, Adam.  Mr. ADAM ROGERS (Senior Editor, Wired magazine): Thank you for pegging my mother-in-law's house perfectly accurately.  (Soundbite of laughter)  FLATOW: Well, let's give you a shot before, you know, people will get aware that you're on the radio. Tell us what would be one of your top picks, Adam, of this year?  Mr. ROGERS: Well, I guess I'll voice some of the tech stuff first just to give props to the wired side and talk a little bit about Google and YouTube.  I'm not trying to make that into a business story, but I do think that it's important and interesting for the future of the Internet that the king of searching for stuff on the Internet has now purchased the king of watching little bits of video on the Internet. I think that presages a total change in the way people consume television and media. And I think it presages what's going to happen in the Internet the next year, too, assuming Google can figure out some key technological issues.  FLATOW: Are you saying we're seeing the death of TV, this year might mark that as we know it?  Mr. ROGERS: Well, I do think it is a bit of a, you know, television is dead, long live television. I think people are - I think what we're seeing with things like YouTube and other places to watch short squibs of video online is that nobody any longer wants to sit in front of the television at a specific place for a specific time.  TiVo means the same thing, right? All of the sort of time shifting that we can do now includes media shifting or medium shifting, I guess, from television to the computer to iPod, to whatever you want to watch it on; and in shorter bytes, not just a half hour or an hour.  And with people making their own. I mean the key thing about YouTube, of course, is not just being able to watch, you know, Star Wars kids playing with, you know, special effect light sabers or watching bits of the Jon Stewart show from the night before, being able to put your own videos on it too.  So, you know, people making their own television. I don't want to give too much of a shout out to another magazine, but I think that some of what Time meant when they put - when they made you the person of the year, that's the sort of crowd sourcing of content on the Internet. It's something we saw more and more of this year, and I think we're going to see more and more next year. People making their own stuff and that being with television that people consume via YouTube, via Google, right?  FLATOW: Now what is the big deal of Google taking that over?  Mr. ROGERS: Well, I think what interests me about it - and like I said, the business stuff I don't particularly care too much about - what interests me is that, you know, right now if you're going to search for something, you Google it, right? It is a verb the same way that, when we copy things, we Xerox them. It is the default search engine for the Web.  But the one thing that nobody really knows how to do online is search for video. You can search for sort of tags on video. You can search for things that people have told you the video is about, right? But there's no way to search for - I want to see pictures of the following. And my kind of sort of prediction, sort of hope, sort of guess, is that if anybody is going to be able to figure out how to search video, it's Google.  FLATOW: Interesting. John, give us one of your top picks.  Mr. JOHN RENNIE (Editor in Chief, Scientific American): I think probably - from a scientific American standpoint, probably the most important story overall was the one you were referring that falls under the general heading of what's been learned about global warming and developments in that area.  Looking back over this past year, it's not that there was any one particular story that most stood out. It's the continuing trend of - obviously - the ongoing validation that global warming is a very real problem, that it is one caused in no small way by what human activity is doing, by putting more greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere. And the fact that some of the political standpoint that, unfortunately, the United States has really not shown the kind of leadership that it should in dealing with this problems seriously.  FLATOW: So the story is just that this is - would you say that the U. S. has finally bought on to this now, or are we still\u2026  Mr. RENNIE: You know, it's funny. What we're seeing is an incremental buy-in to this. The very encouraging things that happened this past year, for example, were, as you mentioned, Al Gore's movie \u201cAn Inconvenient Truth. \u201d I think that helped to convince a lot more people who'd maybe been on the sense previously that global warming is a very real problem, that something has to be done about it.  You know, maybe that's one of those sort of tipping point phenomenon. Another one I think is that we're starting to see the business community is starting to respond. We mentioned at end of year we have our own Scientific American 50 list in which we're acknowledging different technology leaders. And our business leader of the year was actually the Swiss reinsurance company, Swiss Re, because they have been encouraging a lot of the business community to try to factor global warming strategies into their long-term planning. But I think we can even see some sorts of movement at least even within the administration. If nothing else, the fact that the Interior Department now seems to be willing to recognize that polar bears are endangered by the loss of their Arctic habitat.  FLATOW: K. C. Cole, what have you got on your list?  Professor K. C. COLE (Journalism, University of Southern California): Well, in terms of physics, I would say mostly things that haven't been covered very much. I was surprised that there's so little being said about the preparations for the Large Hadron Collider, the LHC, that will become the world's most powerful particle accelerator either this year or next. What's happening is people are trying to figure out what could possibly be seen, extra dimensions begin one of them, new families of particles being another, all kinds of exotic stuff. Mini black holes. If you don't really work out what you might see and what the signature of it would be, then you won't see it if it's not right in front of your nose.  So a lot of it has been about clever new ways of actually looking for invisible things. In math, of course, as he said, I was delighted to see that science put Poincare Conjecture as number one. What I find fascinating about this is that there are all these problems in math that can be solved in dimensions one and two, and Dimensions five or higher. If you want to tie a nine dimensional not in a ten dimensional space - no problem. But Dimensions three and four are very, very complicated and there are these whole class of problems that haven't been solved. So this was quite an important breakthrough. Of course, important for us in a way because we live in three dimensions - four-dimensional space time - and so there's a lot of overlap between math and physics in these areas. And I can say more about this if you'd like but. . .  FLATOW: It was so important that it was made the number one story. I think it's hard for the public to understand how important that might be, that of all stories that one was chosen. Why was that? Can you give us a little more of that flavor?  Prof. COLE: Well, there are a lot of things, you know, that are fairly typical of the way things happen in math, and also science in general. Somebody finds a solution to a problem, whereas other people have found pieces of before and then puts it together in a unique way that eventually everyone looks at and says, yeah, well of course.  Let me just state what simply the problem is that he solved. If you're living in a certain kind of space, basically, how do you know what its shape is? And by shape I don't mean geometric shape, but shape - does it have holes in it. You know, they joke that a topologist someone who doesn't know the difference between a doughnut and a coffee cup, which is true because the only thing that matters is that it has one hole.  So you're basically defining families of kinds of objects in space, just like biologists do. Mathematicians do basically the same thing in terms of classifying.  FLATOW: K. C. , I want you to hold that question because we've got to take a break and I want to get to the - you know, give you time to tell us what that question was. And we'll be back. As I said, we'll be back with all our guests talking about the big science, math, technology stories of the year. Also bring on our other guests to give us their ideas. Stay with us. We'll be right back after this short break.  I'm Ira Flatow. This is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.  (Soundbite of music)  FLATOW: You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow.  We're talking about the top science, health, medicine, technology, mathematics, you know, stories of 2006. I'm running them down with my guests John Rennie, Barron Lerner, K. C. Cole and Adam Rogers. Our number: 1-800-989-8255. And when I rudely interrupted K. C. , as I want to do to all of my guests, she was explaining why the top prize for this year in Science magazine was a mathematics prize. You were about to tell us the significance.  Prof. COLE: OK, what I was trying to explain was that this gave you a way of basically figuring out what kind of topological space you live in even though you're embedded in it, which is a very difficult thing to do. You might ask what possible practical application this kind of thing could have. Well, as usual, it's a lot of the tools that were developed leading up to it will become very important. For example, they teach us things about singularities, you know those nasty things at the parts of black holes that pinch off space time, and they pop up as problems all over the place in statistics and math. So this is actually giving a way to figure out whether or not they're there.  Basically, you imagine a space. If it's a sphere, you can tie a string around it and pull it closed and you won't encounter any resistance. If it's got a hole in it and you do the same thing - you pull the string, it will knot. It will get stuck. And so it's a mathematical way of seeing the topology of the space that you are living in.  FLATOW: Thank you. Barron Lerner, what would be your pick?  Dr. LERNER: I guess one story that you didn't mention was surrounding breast cancer. And interestingly this year, the rates of breast cancer for the last year that we have data, which is 2003, showed a major drop of seven percent of the new cases of the disease. And this was very striking because for years and years - for reasons that people couldn't explain - that rate of breast cancer was either staying the same or creeping up. And there were a lot of different hypotheses as to why that was happening, and then all of a sudden we see this very significant seven percent drop. And now it's being speculated that the reason for that is that women stopped taking hormone replacement therapy because of all the negative publicity about that.  So that was very, very striking because this would suggest that for years and years it was the medicine that was being given to treat the symptoms of menopause that indeed was causing more harm than good.  FLATOW: But it was certainly good news. I mean, what, they said 40,000 deaths were averted.  Dr. LERNER: Exactly. I mean it's very exciting news. And one would expect that this decline would continue because more and more women have gotten off hormone replacement therapy based on the study results.  FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255. Let's go to the phones and get some listeners in. Tony in Nevada City, California. Hi, Tony.  TONY (Caller): Good morning. Yeah, it's a great show. I have it on the pod and listen to you as often as I can. So one of the things that I don't think you covered this year was the imaging of dark matter. And you can see a great picture of this at a site called BadAstronomy. com, and they did it through the use of gravitic lenses.  FLATOW: Yeah, it was the collision of two - like the bullet picture I think it was called. Right, K. C. ?  TONY: Yeah.  Prof. COLE: Right. Yeah, and that's another great example of people being clever about how to figure out how to see something that you can't see - dark matter being essentially transparent, so it doesn't interact with anything. So, you know, they figured out, well, if two galaxies collide, the way that the matter clumps with each other is going to be different than the way the dark matter does and therefore it will be distributed differently. And bingo, they went out and looked for it and they found it.  FLATOW: That's interesting. John, one of the biggest stories of the year - I mean we think - don't think about it, but we remember that Pluto getting kicked out of the planetary lineup.  Mr. RENNIE: Right. But, you know, Tony, this is probably in many respects not the biggest or most important science story in a lot of ways, but it probably grabbed the public's imagination more than almost anything else. And it is a development that actually does have some real scientific importance to it. You know, there's been this question for quite some time when we were looking at Pluto as a sort of very small, oddball planet out sort of towards the edge of the solar system and the question of should it really be a planet. And it's position has been steadily undermined by the discovery of more and more things out in the Kuiper Belt, the ring of icy bodies out - farther out in the solar system, some of which are actually even larger than Pluto. So the decision was that this should actually be sort of relegated to a kind of a dwarf planet status.  And I'll take the maybe publicly unpopular opinion. I think they made the right call on this. Because I think in terms of what we actually know these days about the science of how planets form, demoting Pluto is actually more in keeping with that science even though it's a very sentimentally unpopular position to take.  TONY: Hopefully, this will teach Pluto not to miss meetings.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Prof. COLE: I would like to offer, yeah, a counterargument, if I can. This business of re-categorizing things and renaming them - I mean historically we have so many silly names. We call electrons - we say they have negative charge even though it's a positive presence of some things just because people didn't understand at first that this was a presence instead of an absence. We draw these lines. Objects out in space come in a complete continuous spectrum of sizes and it's very difficult to tell sometimes whether you're dealing with a planet, a failed star. I mean they're not these clear lines. And when we put them out there, we imagine - it reminds me a little of that old Arthur Eddington joke where the astronomer gives a talk to a lay audience about stars and somebody asks him after, well, I understood how you find out about the temperatures of stars and how you find out how hot they were and so forth. One thing I didn't understand. What's that, he says. Well, how did you find out their names?  (Soundbite of laughter)  Prof. COLE: In a way, that's what we're doing.  TONY: Nomenclature was a big story this year in a lot of places, right? Didn't the medical and biomedical community got busted for coming up with silly names for genes because now they're having medical applications as well, and nobody wants to tell a patient that they have a problem with their Sonic the Hedgehog gene?  FLATOW: No one beats physicists with silly names. (Unintelligible) all this kind of stuff like that. 1-800-989 - no, go ahead - 8255 is our number. Let's go to Wayne(ph) in Flagstaff. Hi, Wayne.  WAYNE (Caller): Hey, how you doing?  FLATOW: Hi there.  WAYNE: Good. You might think being from Flagstaff, Arizona, that my top story would be Pluto being demoted. But here in Flagstaff, Pluto will always remain a planet.  FLATOW: There you go.  WAYNE: My top story, believe it or not, was the decision by New York City to outlaw trans fats. And of course all science stories are important, but for some reason this really captures my imagination and my interest. And I just love seeing it when entities like a city like New York, or even a country like Denmark, completely outlaw things that only serve to benefit financially corporations. But everybody knows that trans fats and things like that are bad for us. And that really captured my attention this year.  FLATOW: Barron?  Dr. LERNER: That was quite a story, and it's still an ongoing one. It really speaks to the degree to which we as a country want public health officials to be very aggressive about telling us what to do or what not to do. I think in this case it's a definite positive advance because trans fats, it turns out, really do not much of any good for anybody and do a lot of harm. There were some very important studies on monkeys this year that just showed a small amount of trans fat caused arterial plaque buildup and other problems. So if we want public health officials who are going to be very aggressive and take on business and take on people who want a more libertarian approach, we're going to see more and more things like this in the future.  FLATOW: Thanks for calling.  Prof. COLE: (Unintelligible) ban smoking. Sorry.  FLATOW: Yeah. 1-800-989-8255 is our number. We're talking about the top stories of 2006. Adam, what about all these videogames and the, you know, and then the melding of - I was fortunate enough to get a Wii for the holidays.  Mr. ROGERS: Did you wait in line for it or did you. . .  FLATOW: No, I had an inside-the-store connection - my cousin's girlfriend - my nephew's girlfriend, so to speak.  Mr. ROGERS: That's always good.  FLATOW: I'm addicted to it now because it's so different. And now I notice that there's a WiFi connection that allows me to go to the Web through my Wii, and will allow me to play things with other people on the Web and download other things like - it seems like they want a piece of what Apple seems to want, which is making that one device that's going to combine all the media.  Mr. ROGERS: First of all, let me just say you're doomed now. You're never leaving the house again. Get a replacement host. You're in trouble.  FLATOW: I'm only on level one of \u201cZelda,\u201d so I'm pretty well intact, you know.  Mr. ROGERS: Here's what fascinates me about the Wii. So the Wii is the new Nintendo system. It's this very small little white box. It looks very much like an Apple design, right? It's a little kind of white thing, sits very prettily, glows blue next to your television. This is the first gaming system - I'm not a huge gamer, but we got one in the office and I went in and tried it out. It's the first one that I seen that made me think this is the thing that adults will take out at parties. This is a system that is designed to be - not to be used by sort of a, you know \u201cHalo\u201d obsessive, you know, who's going to sit in front of a really, really high-end $600 system, like what the Playstation 3 is, and try to be there for hours and hours and really gawk at how great the cinematic quality of the graphics and, you know, how great the blood explosions look because of the new physics engine.  This is a system where - you know, the game that I tried out was the tennis game.  FLATOW: I love the tennis game.  Mr. ROGERS: It's fantastic. And on the Wii the graphics are very cartoonish, intentionally so, because it's simple, right?  But the controllers are motion sensitive and wireless. So you stand there and you play tennis as if the controller was your racket. You flick your wrist to hit a ball.  And it's really compelling. I mean it's like Tetris compelling because it's really fun. And you sort of stand there with another person standing next to you, and you're making kind of charades-like gesticulations and trying to get this, trying to win a doubles tennis match.  It really was kind of a journey back to simplicity for video games, for computer games, which is totally the opposite direction that most gamers - most game systems, most game software makers are headed. You know, it's almost like the difference between the Airbus A-380, the giant, you know, double-decker, 600 people, flies around the world, and Boeing's little 787. That's a smaller plane, more efficient, bigger windows and sort of a nicer experience.  The Wii is just a really pleasant experience as a game. And that's - it's something that, as people get more and more serious about the games, I have a suspicion that they get less fun. The Wii is actually more fun.  FLATOW: You actually hold all the sports equipment like you do in real life. I mean it's a little - the controller, they show you how to hold it in the golf game. You have to hold it like a golf club, stand sideways to the screen, and swing, like, the club. And someone imitates it on the screen.  Mr. ROGERS: Bend your knees, keep your back straight\u2026  FLATOW: Yeah. And, you know, it's just - baseball it's as hard as somebody throwing in 95-mile-an-hour baseball, actually, when you don't have to hold the thing like a bat.  So you really, I think, as you say, you actually are part of the game instead of just using your thumb to manipulate it like you do in the other controllers. It's just quite amazing.  Mr. ROGERS: This is such an important thing that's going on now with the kind of computers and the online - I think this year was really the first year where you could seriously talk about online worlds and not the be totally geeking out. I mean places like \u201cEverQuest\u201d and \u201cWorld of Warcraft\u201d and \u201cSecond Life\u201d and \u201cThe Sims\u201d all really became places people go just as much as San Luis Obispo is a place that people go.  FLATOW: Yeah.  Mr. ROGERS: And that's a profound change in the way people I think interact with each other, and sort of think about themselves and their own personalities and where they are in space and time.  FLATOW: 1-800-989-8255 is our number. Another, I guess, watershed event, K. C. , that happened is this political situation, how that affected science this year. And now the switch possibly, because the Democrats are coming back into power.  Prof. COLE: I'm glad you brought that up. I was afraid to because I know the last time I was on I talked about that a lot. But, yeah, what's interesting is it's finally gotten to the point where the scientists are fighting back and saying, enough manipulation, enough wasted money going in really silly programs like the moon to Mars mission, for example, which is just devastating many, many other fields.  And they are getting politicized. They found this - founded the Scientists and Engineers for America, an organization that's actually raising money to run advertising supporting candidates in various fields. Because, you know, it's gotten to that tipping point where people just could not stand anymore the fact that science does not seem to have an ear these days in Washington.  FLATOW: John Rennie, do you agree?  Mr. RENNIE: Oh, absolutely. I mean I think it's - what's unfortunate is that, because the scientists have now had to get sucked into a political process where they have to speak up to defend what should be rational courses of action and the rational interpretation of the scientific findings, it's that unfortunately it does make it possible for people who oppose some of the sorts of actions they'd like to see - for example, global warming deniers and the like - to be able to maintain that scientists themselves just represent their own kind of interest group, their own lobby.  And that I think does - it's a kind of - has a very corrosive effect on the way that the public views science. And there's going to be a lot of damage that's been done by the people who've been opposing this.  FLATOW: Talking about the top stories in science this hour in TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. Hi, Barron, you want to jump it?  Dr. LERNER: Yeah, I just was going to echo that in the world of medicine when Michael J. Fox wound up doing political ads in favor of candidates who were doing stem cell research because of his Parkinson's disease - and that was another very interesting mixture of politics and science where, you know, I think Michael J. Fox was out there as a Parkinson's patient first and foremost saying, I want to scientists to be able to explore whatever they can. But at least the folks on the Republican side assumed that this was all a political ploy, which I really think it wasn't.  FLATOW: We also saw the states scientifically taking on the federal government.  Dr. LERNER: Right. I think, you know, this is an interesting point that the caller who was mentioning the way that New York City was taking action on its own with trans fats. I think it's been very interesting to see the counter reaction to that that you've seen, for example, California trying to take leadership on both stem cell research and also in global warming by setting its own greenhouse gas emission standards.  FLATOW: K. C. ?  Prof. COLE: Well, I was going to say one of the most dangerous places, what you might call faith-based science, has been affecting us is in terms of national security. And we're spending billions and billions of dollars on a missile defense system which virtually, you know, a very tiny percentage of the physics community even think could possibly work.  But just in terms of general reports that scientific organizations have come out with telling us what makes sense to do is not what we're doing in almost every case. We're just not basing these decisions on how to spend dollars in any rational, sane way.  In fact, even trans fats - I mean I was when I was joking about the cigarettes - but even the dangers we tend to go after in the medical field a lot of times just don't make sense compared to other risk factors. It would be nice if we had a rational way of going out and really deciding what's dangerous and how to approach that.  Mr. ROGERS: Well, you know\u2026  FLATOW: Go ahead.  Mr. ROGERS: Ira, at the top of the show you mentioned some of the food safety stories that we've seen this year, and how, you know, people sort of get a little nervous in the salad bar because you don't know whether the food you're looking at has E. coli in it or something like that.  And it just occurred to me that what we were told sort of publicly after the anthrax attacks in 2001 was that a new biosafety program, right - we were going to get really concerned about biological weapons being deployed against us, and that that was also going to help us deal with surveillance for food-based illnesses and figure out emerging diseases as well.  And, you know, none of that happened, either. I think that gets at some of what K. C. was talking about, too. It's that, you know, that even when there's a veneer of rational decision-making or, you know, decisions made based on sort of an immediate panic that we hope will have ramifications that are positive if they go forward; we tend not to be able to make that happen somehow. We still can't figure out how to keep E. coli out of the food chain, you know.  FLATOW: Yeah. We still have trouble making large decisions that will span decades, and moving large masses of bureaucracy and people.  Well, we have to take a short break. We'll come back and talk lots more with K. C. Cole, Adam Rogers, John Rennie and Barron Lerner. So stay with us. We'll take - go right to the phones when we're back and take your calls, get your suggestions for the top science health, medicine, technology, mathematics - whatever I'm leaving out, you put in. Stay with us, we'll be right back.  (Soundbite of music)  FLATOW: I'm Ira Flatow, this is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.  (Soundbite of music)  FLATOW: You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY. I'm Ira Flatow.  We're talking this hour about the year's biggest science stories with my guests, K. C. Cole, science commentator for KPCC in Pasadena. Adam Rogers, senior editor of Wired magazine in San Francisco. John Rennie, editor in chief at Scientific American in New York. And Barron Lerner, author of \u201cWhen Illness Goes Public: Celebrity Patients And How We Look At Medicine. \u201d  That's an interesting topic. We'll have to have you back and talk about that, because I think it's a truly interesting topic. 1-800-989-8255. Let's go to Barry in Boston. Hi, Barry.  Barry(Caller): Hi, thank you for taking my call. Great show.  FLATOW: Thank you.  BARRY: My question is about physics, the year in physics. In previous recent years, I've gotten a lot of pressure from reading books about string theory, say, by Brian Greene. And it's really captured my imagination, putting together Einstein's gravity and quantum physics using a little tiny, teeny things.  FLATOW: Right.  Barry: This year, two books came out, I believe. One of them by Lee Smolin and I'm not sure of the other author, but it was titled \u201cNot Even Wrong. \u201d And you get from the title, books about string theory kind of debunking it or maybe saying it's barking up the wrong tree. What do the your physics (unintelligible)  FLATOW: Yeah, it's come under a lot of - string theory's being hit left and right. Let me go to K. C. and then John, and then go to my panelists. K. C. , What do you think? Has it had its time and it's ran out?  Prof. COLE: No.  FLATOW: Has the string run out?  Prof. COLE: No, it's a very difficult set of problems that they're working with. But these two books did make a very big splash. And I have to admit that I wrote one of the most negative reviews, as was the New York Times review.  In that it is so easy to sit back and criticize - really, by people - the other author was Peter Voit who has a Web site, Not Even Wrong - by people who really aren't that much in the middle of it. Both of the books had a little bit of the flavor of I'm not invited to your meetings. I'm not in your club. Nobody is paying attention to my theories.  You get the impression that you have to be an insider. The thing about string theory is that even string theorists will tell you nobody exactly knows what it is. It's a way of solving this incompatibility between gravity and the large-scale universe and the small-scale universe.  But it had so many mathematical successes that most people are fairly convinced there is something there, even if they're not sure what. And what a lot of these books were also addressed at was basically poo-pooing math, as if, well, you know, it's just mathematics, just mathematics - which goes against the long history of math discovering real things, like anti-matter, for example.  So lots is going on in string theory. It's just that these two books coming out at the same time with the same complaint did get a lot of press attention.  FLATOW: John.  BARRY: I keep reading about string theory.  FLATOW: Well, these are not the first critics of string theory.  Mr. RENNIE: No, that's right. I mean we'll continue to have a lot more in the future, you know. String theory is - it's the big one on the block. It's the theory currently that everybody would have to knock over - what they have to beat to come up with something that is a better theory.  You know, I think string theory - it does, it has contributed a lot and there are legitimate questions of course about, you know, string theory. There are many, many different formulations - never questions - of how do you settle on what is the best one. But, really, somebody's got to come up with a theory that clearly works better than string theory does to be a serious critic.  Mr. ROGERS: And so I'm not sure it's fair to criticize Smolin's book at least as being, you know, an outsider who just says, well I don't get to come to that party so they must all be jerks. I mean he had, you know, he had published in string theory. And also, that's a little bit - K. C. , that's a little bit of an ad homonym, right? I mean the substance of the book is very solid.  Prof. COLE: Well, yeah. If you talk to string theorists, they would say that, throughout the book, the success of loop quantum gravity has been vastly exaggerated compared to string theory. I think one of his big complaints, which is something that bothers a lot of people in the physics community, is just what Ira mentioned - the fact that string theory has probably an infinite number of solutions. So you're left with the problem of, well, you know, is there a right solution? Why are we living in a universe that looks like this when it could look just about any other way?  And several physicists have come out in favor of the anthropic principle, which I'm sure we must have talked about it before. The idea is that we live in the universe we do because, if it were any different, we couldn't live here. And that is very bothersome. And he really does have a legitimate point on that.  FLATOW: All right, we're going to - we'll pick it up, Barry, later on because we love talking about string theory. Thanks a lot. 1-800-989-8255. Let's go to Palo Alto, where Stephanie is. Hi, Stephanie.  STEPHANIE (Caller): Yes. Hello, good morning.  FLATOW: Good morning. Good afternoon.  STEPHANIE: I wonder if I can explain this nice and clearly. Diabetics who are dependant on several injections of insulin are now freed from the constant jabbings of the needle. This year, a new product was approved by the FDA and by the European authorities whereby the patients take insulin into their blood stream through the lungs, by inhaling the insulin.  It took 15 years to develop this, or at least it took a great number of years to get the FDA to approve it because they were nervous about breathing this stuff in through the lungs, but it seems to have proved to be no problem at all.  And so diabetics, who frequently postpone taking the insulin because they don't want to keep jabbing themselves, hopefully will start on the medication sooner, before they start having serious side effects from the diabetes. So we think that this is a very exciting new development.  FLATOW: Dr. Lerner, do you want to comment?  Dr. LERNER: Yeah. It is very exciting, although one of the interesting aspects of it is that patients have not embraced it - and I think physicians as well -as quickly as we might have imagined.  And for years and years, for example, many of my patients have complained about the needles over and over again. And when I raised this, they were like oh, no, I wouldn't do that.  FLATOW: Is that right? Why - what's the - because it's new?  Dr. LERNER: Well, part of it it's new. There has been this discussion. It hasn't been around long enough. Are there possible long-term side effects in the lungs? And even though the FDA has been pretty reassuring about that, there are concerns.  FLATOW: Stephanie, are you a diabetic?  STEPHANIE: No, I'm not. Actually, I'm the mother of the man who developed it.  FLATOW: Oh.  STEPHANIE: Yeah.  (Soundbite of laughter)  Dr. LERNER: Full disclosure. Wait a minute\u2026  (Soundbite of laughter)  FLATOW: Well, that's nice of his mom to come on.  (Soundbite of laughter)  STEPHANIE: Well, but I think that this is really an exciting thing. And it's going to take time, I understand from my son, to educate the patient population on the use of the product. And it has been in trials for quite a number of years, and so far there have not been any contra-indications, so it seems like a very exciting new technology.  FLATOW: Well, you're a terrific\u2026  Dr. LERNER: I want my mom to call in.  FLATOW: Yeah, you're a terrific mom.  STEPHANIE: I'm a terrific mom. I'll tell my son.  FLATOW: Tell him to give us a call, all right?  (Soundbite of laughter)  FLATOW: Thanks, Stephanie. Have a happy new year to you.  STEPHANIE: Thank you. Same to you. Bye-bye.  FLATOW: Bye. Another moment on SCIENCE FRIDAY. 1-800-989-8255 is our number. Let's go ahead to David(ph) in St. Paul, moving across the country.  DAVID (Caller): Yeah, Ira, how are you doing?  FLATOW: What kind of winter are you having this year?  DAVID: It's (unintelligible), I'll tell you. It's about 40-some-odd degrees. It's kind of freezing, not-quite-freezing rain. There's no snow on the ground, at least in the Twin Cities.  FLATOW: Wow.  DAVID: So it's a very warm winter, actually. It's funny, you were talking about the Large Hadron Collider. I remember, I think when I was coming out of college, going in the military, they were considering building something called the Superconducting Super-Collider in Texas, which of course our government, in its infinite wisdom, decided to not fund.  I'm eagerly awaiting the tune-up and then the final configuration, the bean(ph) configuration from the LHC. But my story, I guess, is something that - I guess it broke in the last couple of months, and that's the recent evidence for either contemporaneous or recent aboveground water flow on Mars. I think that that's\u2026  FLATOW: Those gullies, a picture of those gullies.  DAVID: Yes, exactly.  FLATOW: The stains on the gullies which had to be leftover mineral deposits in the water.  DAVID: Right.  FLATOW: Yeah, they were amazing.  DAVID: That's something that I think is, I mean, there's going to be a lot of work on that going on. And the ramifications, of course, if they do confirm that there had been water flowing aboveground on Mars recently, I don't think those ramifications can be underestimated.  Unidentified Man: Yeah, I mean, that is certainly - that is one of the most exciting sorts of planetary science discoveries of this past year. You know, any water that's flowing across the Martian surface is very short-lived. Mostly, any kind of water that's there near the surface is frozen.  You may have something like permafrost, and you may get some periodic melting just below the surface, and then sort of an ice dam may break and you may see some sort of flow. It certainly is one more thing that reinforces the view we have that Mars was a much wetter planet at one time.  I think everybody would love to be able to take the jump and say this must mean, then, that the odds for life in the past or maybe in at least some primitive form on Mars must still be pretty good. But we really don't know much about that, I mean even beyond just the impossible-to-peg probabilities associated with life on another planet, anyway.  There's a very good possibility that, for example, the pH of that water may be way off. That water might be highly acidic, for example, too acidic to imagine that you would easily get life forms evolving in it. But that's something we'll find out about more over time.  FLATOW: Thanks for calling, David. 1-800-989-8255. K. C. , did you want to say something?  Prof. COLE: Yeah. I just wanted to say that it was interesting when I had actually been forwarded news reports about that and looked at them, and they basically said this has been discovered and the interpretation is that there was water recently flowing. But if you actually read what was said, it was that that was one very probable interpretation.  So I think that's something you have to keep in mind. But also that, I mean, one of the really sad things about the way the budget priorities have been shuffled around at NASA is that if we're interested in looking for life, one, we should be funding astrobiology more; and they've been cut. I mean, those are the people who actually figure what life might be elsewhere and what it would look like.  And also, you know, the Jupiter moon missions, where you have, you know, a pretty good chance. Europa's a pretty exciting place to go, more exciting I think than putting a man back on the moon.  FLATOW: We're talking about science stories this hour, TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News. Were those cut, all the Jupiter missions, K. C. ? Or were they - just some of them?  Prof. COLE: (Unintelligible) they've been back and forth, Jupiter icy moon orbiter. They were gone, then they were back\u2026  FLATOW: Well, maybe the new Congress will have something to say about that.  Prof. COLE: Yes. Yeah. I think they will. But in terms of what you can do in discovery, you can do so much more with robots.  FLATOW: Just a few more minutes to go. Let's go to Jerry(ph) in Mountain View, California. Lots of Californians calling in today. Hi, Jerry.  JERRY (Caller): Hi, how you doing?  FLATOW: Hi.  JERRY: The new electric cars that are coming up, like the Tesla car that has zero to 60 in four seconds and a 250-mile range with lithium ion batteries. And the big thing is really that the improvement of the lithium ion, which is your gas tank. The car has been around for a while, but the lithium ion is a big thing.  FLATOW: Adam Rogers?  Mr. ROGERS: Yeah. This is awesome, right? I mean, it's a little outside my price point. But the interesting thing about the electric motor, right, is that - and batteries like lithium ion batteries - is they have a bearing on sports cars in a few things. First of all, like, you know, you want a sports car with a low center of gravity that sort of, you know, sits low and is heavy to the ground. So that's perfect if you're going to load in, you know, a couple hundred lithium ion batteries, right?  Then, one other that you want is low-end torque. Well, electric motors are really good at generating low-end torque, right? They spin up very quickly.  FLATOW: You just have to ride a subway to know that.  Mr. ROGERS: Yeah, exactly. And then get pushed back in your seat or lose your grip on the strap, right?  FLATOW: Right.  Mr. ROGERS: So, you know, all these things, especially when you add in, you know, venture capital billionaires and a lot of designers from Lotus, can produce a really nifty car which, you know, aside from just the - I grew up in Los Angeles, and so that means a lot to me right off. But it also does suggest, I think, a difference in approach, as John was talking about, an opinion about global warming and about green technology and climate change. That the idea now has become, look, this stuff is happening; what are we going to do about it? And that ranges from figuring out more-efficient photovoltaics to how do we build a really cool electric car.  And I think the important thing is going to be, you know, to make sure the Tesla doesn't turn out to be DeLorean, right? I mean, put aside the drug-scandal thing - but to see if they actually build some other cars, too, that might actually be in my price range.  FLATOW: Do you think that if more Silicon Valley engineers turned toward the automotive industry, things might change?  Mr. ROGERS: Well, it's pretty to think so. I mean I would hope so. But I think that, you know, they thought that about space, too, right? And a lot of the Silicon Valley guys, including Elon Musk, who's also involved with the Tesla, right? Elon Musk made his money at PayPal, is involved with Tesla and also involved in a known space venture, SpaceX. I think that, you know, the success that they have with their companies starts to make them think that they might try something in another field, too.  I would love to see more involvement by these kind of smart engineers in the automotive industry. But you already have a lot of smart engineers, right? I mean these folks are not constrained by their intelligence, they're constrained by some economics issues, I think, that maybe you start to overcome when the price of oil gets above $50 bucks a barrel, and photovoltaics get better, and lithium ion batteries get better, and, and, and.  FLATOW: I have about one minute to go. I mentioned at the beginning there was the story that didn't happen, being the hurricane season that we thought might happen. Any other story, one story, come to mind, John, that didn't happen that surprised you that didn't happen this year?  Mr. RENNIE: Yeah, I'll mention something. It was a story embedded inside a story that did get attention. There was a lot of headlines that went to the report that came out that suggested that, by 2048, we could basically collapse of all the ocean's fisheries.  But the story that didn't really get the right attention inside there was the fact that that collapse was not just from over-fishing or pollution, it was partly just the fact that you were seeing the biodiversity of the ocean start to drop off. That, in itself, caused more extinction events. That's a very important ecological finding and something that's going to be very important when we look at the kind of consequences for the future.  FLATOW: Well, I want to thank you all. K. C. - something in 15 seconds. You can jump in on that.  Prof. COLE: Oh, just following on that, how many of the stories had ethical consequences that we need to consider, whether it's in terms of environment, nanotechnology, anything, yeah.  FLATOW: We didn't even get into nanotechnology. I mean it's such a cutting-edge thing. We'll have to do this again soon. Thank you all for taking time to be with me today. K. C.
