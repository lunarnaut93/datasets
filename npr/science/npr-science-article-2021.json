Scientists say that while the variant does not appear to be more dangerous, it does seem to be more contagious. And, of course, all this is happening as hospitals across the country operate at or near capacity and brace for what might be another post-holiday surge. We wanted to know more about how this virus is mutating and how we should think about it, so we've called Matt McCarthy. He is a physician, an authority on infectious disease and professor of medicine at Cornell University. And he's the author of \"Superbugs: The Race To Stop An Epidemic. \"Dr. McCarthy, it's nice to have you back with us on the program. Thanks for joining us. MATT MCCARTHY: Thanks for having me. MARTIN: Before we jump into the specifics of this new strain, I just would like a refresher on how a virus mutates. I mean, how exactly does this happen? And how do we know that this virus has mutated? MCCARTHY: Right. So coronavirus is an RNA virus, and these types of viruses are prone to mutate because every time they replicate, there's a chance for a new introduction of something new into its genetic code. And we were expecting it to mutate. You know, this is not a surprise. It's just like influenza or measles or some other virus. These things all mutate, usually with what we call selective pressure. So if there is some reason for it to mutate, it will, such as the introduction of new drugs or vaccines or convalescent plasma. Anything that attacks the virus will cause it to change. MARTIN: Well, I was going to ask you about that. I mean, how should we think about the fact that there are - at least a couple of states have reported cases of this new strain? And so far as we know - because we know that people have had a hard time with contact tracing - but so far as we know, the individuals weren't traveling, didn't have contact with folks who were in places where we knew this new strain had developed. I mean, how should we think about that? Is that concerning? Or is this something that - to be expected in a pandemic of this size, where there's - this many people are infected? MCCARTHY: Yeah, we've known about this variant since the summer, and we've been keeping track of it. And what caught our attention is that it started to become the dominant strain in certain parts of the United Kingdom. And the expectation is that if it was in the United Kingdom back in the summer, and people were flying to the United States, as they have been for a while, that it was certainly going to be here. Now, what we know about it is that based on modeling, it looks to be more transmissible, and it looks to cause a bit of a higher viral load, meaning that when you cough this variant, you may be expelling more of the virus, which could be the way that it's more transmissible. Now, there's no evidence it's more deadly, or that it's resistant to our vaccines, or that it's resistant to our treatments. But the fact that it could spread more quickly and that this is a potentially deadly virus is cause for concern. The fact that it could go through a community more quickly is enough to get all of us to pay very close attention to it. MARTIN: You were on this program to talk about your book on so-called superbugs. These are drug-resistant bacteria that are - you know, they're dangerous, difficult to treat. And in that interview, you talked about the relationship between the government and pharmaceutical companies, and you said there should be more cooperation in drug development so that medical professionals can better handle outbreaks. Now, that was in 2019. Has this whole experience that we've all been living through changed your view on the relationship between Big Pharma and the government at all? Is anything working the way you think it should be? MCCARTHY: Yeah. So the short answer is that Operation Warp Speed has been a tremendous success. And the reason it was successful is that the federal government removed risk from these companies from taking on a very risky project, which was a vaccine for a new virus, and taking on such an important problem - you know, the greatest pandemic of our lives. Now, what we need to do after this pandemic is behind us is we need to put renewed attention on the antibiotic crisis, the fact that these pharmaceutical companies don't want to make new antibiotics because it's very expensive, and it's very risky. We can use Operation Warp Speed as a model to attack superbugs and to attack the fact that there are going to be drug-resistant pathogens that are going to be attacking us for the remainder of our lives and for generations to come. Operation Warp Speed is a great example of how these companies can do a very difficult thing if we incentivize it and we remove the risk, and we give them the right publicity, frankly, to make this worth their while. MARTIN: And before we let you go, what should just people listening to our conversation be thinking about right now? I mean, you're based in New York, which has experienced this COVID-19 surge this past spring. I mean, you were really on the front lines in more ways than one - right? - in seeing this whole thing unfold. But, you know, a lot has changed since then, for better and for worse. I mean, on the one hand, the virus has spread all over the country. On the other hand, you know, more treatment options and a vaccine. So you've got this on-the-one-hand-on-the-other-hand situation. How do you encourage our listeners, just all of us as people, to think about the moment that we are in? MCCARTHY: For the people who are listening, you know, it's not going away anytime soon. We've got to stick to the things that we know that work - the social distancing and doing what we can to not put ourselves in harm's way.

A new rule makes it simpler for doctors to prescribe a drug called buprenorphine. This comes as opioid overdose deaths continue to rise. NPR addiction correspondent Brian Mann reports. BRIAN MANN, BYLINE: When Sara Combs found a residential treatment program for her son, Adam, who was addicted to prescription pain pills and the deadly synthetic opioid fentanyl, she thought he was on track and would get healthy again. SARA COMBS: They called me, like, on a Wednesday, and they said he's getting out tomorrow. MANN: Combs is a nurse who lives in Phoenix, Ariz. She says Adam came home without any medication, nothing to help him avoid cravings or relapse. A few days later, she found him in her guestroom. COMBS: I went in and touched him, and he was cold. And I see on the ground, like over his bed, I see the foil and the straw because that's how he was, you know, smoking that Percocet 30. So I was just - what do you mean you're dead, you know? MANN: Adam, who died in 2018, was 26 years old, part of a devastating wave of opioid overdoses that has surged again by 20% during the COVID pandemic. Now the Trump administration has responded by making it far easier for doctors to prescribe buprenorphine, a drug that sharply reduces withdrawal symptoms and opioid cravings. Federal officials dropped a longstanding requirement that doctors treating opioid addiction get extra training and a waiver before prescribing buprenorphine. Admiral Brett Giroir is assistant secretary in the Health and Human Services Department. BRETT GIROIR: This change is earthshaking to the substance use community, and I do believe it will save thousands or tens of thousands of lives. MANN: This comes as part of a broader effort to destigmatize medical treatment for Americans caught up in the opioid epidemic. Keith Humphreys, who studies addiction treatment at Stanford University, says it was long overdue. KEITH HUMPHREYS: You didn't need any extra training to prescribe buprenorphine for pain, nor did you need any extra training to prescribe OxyContin. So if you can do those things, it really made no sense that you couldn't prescribe buprenorphine for addiction. MANN: Dr. Patrice Harris, who heads the American Medical Association's Opioid Task Force, says she thinks this will help more doctors view addiction as something they can treat. PATRICE HARRIS: Yes, office-based physicians will see this as an elimination of a barrier and will add this to their practices. MANN: Sara Combs, who lost her son Adam to opioids, says she wishes the reform had come earlier. She believes buprenorphine might have kept him alive. COMBS: All he could think of was his cravings and needed to go back to it right away. And I think that's why he so quickly passed.

I'm Manoush Zomorodi. On the show today - breath. And something else we do unconsciously every single time we take a breath. . . (SOUNDBITE OF SNIFFING)ZOMORODI: . . . We smell. (SOUNDBITE OF SNIFFING)CARO VERBEEK: We breathe about 22,000 per 24 hours. And all that time, we smell. ZOMORODI: This is Caro Verbeek. VERBEEK: And I'm an art and scent historian. And I research lost scents, try to recreate them and then exhibit those smells. ZOMORODI: In case you missed that, Caro is a scent historian. VERBEEK: Yeah. ZOMORODI: She works with other historians and artists and perfumers to bring smells to museums, the kind of smells that define pivotal moments in history. VERBEEK: So one of the smells that we introduced in the museum, in the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, was the smell of the Battle of Waterloo. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ZOMORODI: The Battle of Waterloo in 1815, when Napoleon Bonaparte lost to the British and their allies. There's a famous 200-year-old painting of the battle by Jan Willem Pieneman. And in 2017, Caro reconstructed the smells characterized in Pieneman's painting. (SOUNDBITE OF GUNFIRE)VERBEEK: So imagine this huge painting, 8 by 5 meters. Above, you see very dark, dramatic clouds because it was very rainy during the Battle of Waterloo. (SOUNDBITE OF EXPLOSION)VERBEEK: You will also see thousands of tiny soldiers, thousands of horses, weapons, some French captives, even some dead soldiers lying in the mud, all in the foreground. (SOUNDBITE OF HORSE NEIGHING)VERBEEK: And in the middle, center stage, General Wellington. And Wellington was English, and he was victorious. So he's sitting there on this horse looking grand. (SOUNDBITE OF HORSE NEIGHING)VERBEEK: So together with the perfumer, we decided to translate this painting into a composition, a smell composition, because we often forget that history is all about smells. And particularly, wars were incredibly smelly. ZOMORODI: So if I were visiting the museum when this exhibit was on, what was the experience like? VERBEEK: So if you were present, you immediately would have noticed the smell of horses, but also of anxiety, the smell of fear, gunpowder, leather. And because it was raining, you would have smelled moist earth and grass. And last but not least - Napoleon's perfume. And it might smell - I don't know about your grandmother, but my grandmother wore the same perfume as Napoleon, as did many of our grandmothers, because it is now known as 4711 Eau de Cologne. Do you know this? ZOMORODI: It's the one with the turquoise circle on it? VERBEEK: Yeah, yeah. And this cologne worn by Napoleon could be described as incredibly fresh and slightly sour and sweet because there were citrus fruits in there, like bergamot and lemon, but also flowers and rosemary. ZOMORODI: I do know that one. I hate that smell. VERBEEK: (Laughter) Napoleon loved that smell because he had a Proustian memory of his days that he was in power, that he was ruling Europe. So to him, that was a very important smell. But it was also a scent used by many soldiers in the 18th and 19th century because it helped them to mask and fight the evil smells of war because war is incredibly stinky. You need to do something to protect yourself. ZOMORODI: And when you say war is stinky, not just because they weren't bathing very often but because of, I'm assuming, injury and death. VERBEEK: Yeah, that's a good question. And here, of course, you want to be, historically, as accurate as possible. But you also have to take into account that you're in a museum. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VERBEEK: This smell is the only scent that is innately foul. So people would feel so sick - we would have to position buckets below the painting if we would have done this. ZOMORODI: (Laughter). VERBEEK: So, no, we did not include this horrible smell. And that's why we also decided to connect it to Napoleon fleeing the battlefield. So he's already distancing himself from this horrible, putrid scent. And instead, you smell his perfume, the smell of fear, the moist earth, some gunpowder and some leather. And what happened was quite remarkable. I did not foresee this. Some people actually said that when they started smelling and looking at the painting simultaneously, they felt as though they were in the painting instead of just looking at it from a distance. One person even reported that she saw the horses move because it became so much more realistic because of the smell. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)VERBEEK: So history can tell us a lot about smells, but sometimes smells can also tell us a lot about history. ZOMORODI: Caro Verbeek continues from the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TEDx TALK)VERBEEK: As I smell historian, I stick my nose into various things, things you cannot even imagine. I smell mummies. Here, I'm smelling an ancient, fragrant piece of jewelry. I've been to antique apothecary cabinets. And I've also smelled perfumed wigs. In the 18th century, the wealthy perfumed their wigs. The Amsterdam Museum has a wig of an 18th-century Amsterdam mayor, and I wanted to smell - if I could figure out - which perfumes they might have used. So I went there. I was a bit hesitant at first because, of course, it's very intimate. It's something someone wore close to his skin. But I bent over, used both nostrils, inhaled - no perfume, but I did smell something else. I smelled this animal. This wig was clearly made of horsehair. And the smell of horses always takes me back to my childhood because I used to do horseback riding. And I bet you all know this feeling. You enter a room, you smell something, suddenly you're back at your grandparents' house. Smell is apparently the strongest inducer of memories - of early memories. (SOUNDBITE OF HORSE NICKER)VERBEEK: Horses have this sour, sweet, acrid smell - a very warm smell. Once I inhaled that smell, I just - I couldn't be prepared for what happened. I felt emotional. I felt as though I was a child again. I was transported back in time immediately. ZOMORODI: It's like olfactory deja vu in some ways. VERBEEK: Yeah, it's amazing. That's another reason why I love studying smells and actually smelling. Because there's a big difference between thinking about a smell and actually smelling something. Because you can only have this Proustian memory if you are actually smelling a substance from your own past. ZOMORODI: Hmm. VERBEEK: So if you liked horseback riding as a child and you would smell a horse now or even when you're in your 80s, you would immediately be transported back in time. That it doesn't just make you think about that period in your early life, it makes you feel as though you are reliving it. And why it's so mind-blowing to smell something from the past and so emotional - that's more important - is because in our brains, the olfactory bulb or our smell brain, so to say, is connected to our emotional brain or the amygdala. ZOMORODI: Ah. VERBEEK: This, again, is connected to our brain stem, where we regulate memory. So memory, smell and emotion are one and the same. ZOMORODI: Can you tell me - you know, I assume that you must have a very keen sense of smell. Do you have a process by which you inhale a scent? VERBEEK: Well, they say that you can use the sniffing technique - so short, fast inhalations, a bit like a dog (sniffing) - that can help (sniffing). And what is also very important is to use both nostrils. Many of us are not aware of the fact that one nostril actually perceives something different than the other. ZOMORODI: No, I did not know that. My nostrils are not equal in power (laughter)? VERBEEK: No, no one's nostrils are equal in power. I don't know if you have anything - fragrance - around you. You can even test it. ZOMORODI: I do. I have a coffee. Hang on. OK. Ready. VERBEEK: So you close one nostril - it doesn't matter which one - and then you inhale the coffee. ZOMORODI: (Inhaling) OK. VERBEEK: And then you simply close your other nostril and inhale the coffee again. ZOMORODI: (Inhaling) Whoa. It was, like, complimentary smells, but not the same. VERBEEK: Yeah, exactly. Because those two smells from both of your nostrils, they produce the smell of coffee as we know it. But of course, we never close one nostril. ZOMORODI: That is so weird. It was like hearing the melody in one nostril and the - sort of the harmony in the other. And hearing the two separate tracks and then bringing them together, you got the full song. VERBEEK: Yeah. I like that. (SOUNDBITE OF TEDx TALK)VERBEEK: We have two eyes, and we have two ears to perceive ambiently. But why do you think we have two nostrils? I'll explain why. There's a constant fast airflow in one of your nostrils and a slow one in the other because some molecules are only detectable in slow or fast airflows. So in order to perceive everything, you have to use both nostrils to smell three-dimensionally. And here it comes. Every three hours, this changes. Your nostrils take shifts. ZOMORODI: Wait, what? My nostrils swap smelling duties every three hours? VERBEEK: Yeah. It's so fabulous (laughter). ZOMORODI: So why do you think it's important that we give more thought and attention to smell? Why do you think that's important? VERBEEK: Well, smell and sense, just like paintings and music, are part of our heritage. It's a different doorway - an even more emotional and direct doorway - to the past. And smell is a really good conversation starter. So as soon as you bring in smells, people start talking, start discussing in a very open way. And I think this is important not just the smelling itself, but that what it leads to - to beautiful discussions about the way we perceive the world. ZOMORODI: The other thing that strikes me is you can't avoid smelling because, as you said, you have to breathe 22,000 times a day. So there is no choice but to smell as you breathe, right? VERBEEK: Yeah. So why not make it more interesting, right? And maybe connect it to who you are in the world in relation to other people, in other cultures and our history. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ZOMORODI: That's Caro Verbeek. She's an art and scent historian at the Vrije University Amsterdam and the Rijksmuseum, where she reconstructs Europe's lost smells. You can hear her talk at ted. com. MANOUSH ZOMORODI, HOST:   It's the TED Radio Hour from NPR. I'm Manoush Zomorodi. On the show today - breath. And something else we do unconsciously every single time we take a breath. . . (SOUNDBITE OF SNIFFING) ZOMORODI: . . . We smell.

There's a famous 200-year-old painting of the battle by Jan Willem Pieneman. And in 2017, Caro reconstructed the smells characterized in Pieneman's painting. (SOUNDBITE OF GUNFIRE) VERBEEK: So imagine this huge painting, 8 by 5 meters. Above, you see very dark, dramatic clouds because it was very rainy during the Battle of Waterloo. (SOUNDBITE OF EXPLOSION) VERBEEK: You will also see thousands of tiny soldiers, thousands of horses, weapons, some French captives, even some dead soldiers lying in the mud, all in the foreground. (SOUNDBITE OF HORSE NEIGHING) VERBEEK: And in the middle, center stage, General Wellington. And Wellington was English, and he was victorious. So he's sitting there on this horse looking grand. (SOUNDBITE OF HORSE NEIGHING) VERBEEK: So together with the perfumer, we decided to translate this painting into a composition, a smell composition, because we often forget that history is all about smells. And particularly, wars were incredibly smelly. ZOMORODI: So if I were visiting the museum when this exhibit was on, what was the experience like? VERBEEK: So if you were present, you immediately would have noticed the smell of horses, but also of anxiety, the smell of fear, gunpowder, leather. And because it was raining, you would have smelled moist earth and grass. And last but not least - Napoleon's perfume. And it might smell - I don't know about your grandmother, but my grandmother wore the same perfume as Napoleon, as did many of our grandmothers, because it is now known as 4711 Eau de Cologne. Do you know this? ZOMORODI: It's the one with the turquoise circle on it? VERBEEK: Yeah, yeah. And this cologne worn by Napoleon could be described as incredibly fresh and slightly sour and sweet because there were citrus fruits in there, like bergamot and lemon, but also flowers and rosemary. ZOMORODI: I do know that one. I hate that smell. VERBEEK: (Laughter) Napoleon loved that smell because he had a Proustian memory of his days that he was in power, that he was ruling Europe. So to him, that was a very important smell. But it was also a scent used by many soldiers in the 18th and 19th century because it helped them to mask and fight the evil smells of war because war is incredibly stinky. You need to do something to protect yourself. ZOMORODI: And when you say war is stinky, not just because they weren't bathing very often but because of, I'm assuming, injury and death. VERBEEK: Yeah, that's a good question. And here, of course, you want to be, historically, as accurate as possible. But you also have to take into account that you're in a museum. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) VERBEEK: This smell is the only scent that is innately foul. So people would feel so sick - we would have to position buckets below the painting if we would have done this. ZOMORODI: (Laughter). VERBEEK: So, no, we did not include this horrible smell. And that's why we also decided to connect it to Napoleon fleeing the battlefield. So he's already distancing himself from this horrible, putrid scent. And instead, you smell his perfume, the smell of fear, the moist earth, some gunpowder and some leather. And what happened was quite remarkable. I did not foresee this. Some people actually said that when they started smelling and looking at the painting simultaneously, they felt as though they were in the painting instead of just looking at it from a distance. One person even reported that she saw the horses move because it became so much more realistic because of the smell. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) VERBEEK: So history can tell us a lot about smells, but sometimes smells can also tell us a lot about history. ZOMORODI: Caro Verbeek continues from the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TEDx TALK) VERBEEK: As I smell historian, I stick my nose into various things, things you cannot even imagine. I smell mummies. Here, I'm smelling an ancient, fragrant piece of jewelry. I've been to antique apothecary cabinets. And I've also smelled perfumed wigs. In the 18th century, the wealthy perfumed their wigs. The Amsterdam Museum has a wig of an 18th-century Amsterdam mayor, and I wanted to smell - if I could figure out - which perfumes they might have used. So I went there. I was a bit hesitant at first because, of course, it's very intimate. It's something someone wore close to his skin. But I bent over, used both nostrils, inhaled - no perfume, but I did smell something else. I smelled this animal. This wig was clearly made of horsehair. And the smell of horses always takes me back to my childhood because I used to do horseback riding. And I bet you all know this feeling. You enter a room, you smell something, suddenly you're back at your grandparents' house. Smell is apparently the strongest inducer of memories - of early memories. (SOUNDBITE OF HORSE NICKER) VERBEEK: Horses have this sour, sweet, acrid smell - a very warm smell. Once I inhaled that smell, I just - I couldn't be prepared for what happened. I felt emotional. I felt as though I was a child again. I was transported back in time immediately. ZOMORODI: It's like olfactory deja vu in some ways. VERBEEK: Yeah, it's amazing. That's another reason why I love studying smells and actually smelling. Because there's a big difference between thinking about a smell and actually smelling something. Because you can only have this Proustian memory if you are actually smelling a substance from your own past. ZOMORODI: Hmm. VERBEEK: So if you liked horseback riding as a child and you would smell a horse now or even when you're in your 80s, you would immediately be transported back in time. That it doesn't just make you think about that period in your early life, it makes you feel as though you are reliving it. And why it's so mind-blowing to smell something from the past and so emotional - that's more important - is because in our brains, the olfactory bulb or our smell brain, so to say, is connected to our emotional brain or the amygdala. ZOMORODI: Ah. VERBEEK: This, again, is connected to our brain stem, where we regulate memory. So memory, smell and emotion are one and the same. ZOMORODI: Can you tell me - you know, I assume that you must have a very keen sense of smell. Do you have a process by which you inhale a scent? VERBEEK: Well, they say that you can use the sniffing technique - so short, fast inhalations, a bit like a dog (sniffing) - that can help (sniffing). And what is also very important is to use both nostrils. Many of us are not aware of the fact that one nostril actually perceives something different than the other. ZOMORODI: No, I did not know that. My nostrils are not equal in power (laughter)? VERBEEK: No, no one's nostrils are equal in power. I don't know if you have anything - fragrance - around you. You can even test it. ZOMORODI: I do. I have a coffee. Hang on. OK. Ready. VERBEEK: So you close one nostril - it doesn't matter which one - and then you inhale the coffee. ZOMORODI: (Inhaling) OK. VERBEEK: And then you simply close your other nostril and inhale the coffee again. ZOMORODI: (Inhaling) Whoa. It was, like, complimentary smells, but not the same. VERBEEK: Yeah, exactly. Because those two smells from both of your nostrils, they produce the smell of coffee as we know it. But of course, we never close one nostril. ZOMORODI: That is so weird. It was like hearing the melody in one nostril and the - sort of the harmony in the other. And hearing the two separate tracks and then bringing them together, you got the full song. VERBEEK: Yeah. I like that. (SOUNDBITE OF TEDx TALK) VERBEEK: We have two eyes, and we have two ears to perceive ambiently. But why do you think we have two nostrils? I'll explain why. There's a constant fast airflow in one of your nostrils and a slow one in the other because some molecules are only detectable in slow or fast airflows. So in order to perceive everything, you have to use both nostrils to smell three-dimensionally. And here it comes. Every three hours, this changes. Your nostrils take shifts. ZOMORODI: Wait, what? My nostrils swap smelling duties every three hours? VERBEEK: Yeah. It's so fabulous (laughter). ZOMORODI: So why do you think it's important that we give more thought and attention to smell? Why do you think that's important? VERBEEK: Well, smell and sense, just like paintings and music, are part of our heritage. It's a different doorway - an even more emotional and direct doorway - to the past. And smell is a really good conversation starter. So as soon as you bring in smells, people start talking, start discussing in a very open way. And I think this is important not just the smelling itself, but that what it leads to - to beautiful discussions about the way we perceive the world. ZOMORODI: The other thing that strikes me is you can't avoid smelling because, as you said, you have to breathe 22,000 times a day. So there is no choice but to smell as you breathe, right? VERBEEK: Yeah. So why not make it more interesting, right? And maybe connect it to who you are in the world in relation to other people, in other cultures and our history. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ZOMORODI: That's Caro Verbeek. She's an art and scent historian at the Vrije University Amsterdam and the Rijksmuseum, where she reconstructs Europe's lost smells.

Baltimore is arguing that major oil and gas companies should be forced to pay for the costs of climate change. More than 20 cities and states have brought similar suits. This is the first to be considered by the highest court. NPR's Rebecca Hersher reports. REBECCA HERSHER, BYLINE: Baltimore is an old city. It was once a rich city. But the city's infrastructure was never built for climate change, and Baltimore can't keep up with the costs. MICHEL ANDERSON: Yeah, so we're basically - we're walking along the Jones Falls. HERSHER: Michel Anderson does community outreach for the clean water advocacy group Blue Water Baltimore. Construction crews are upgrading pipes that were laid about 100 years ago. It was a state-of-the-art sewer and stormwater system. ANDERSON: It was considered an engineering marvel at the time. It rivaled the sewers of Paris, from what I read. HERSHER: Not much of that historic history is obvious in 2020. The system is starting to fail. Pipes have cracked, and they're too small to handle the water during big rains. Anderson points across the river where a sign says health warning. ANDERSON: That dumps tens of millions of gallons of sewage into the waterway. You know, and that's during severe rainstorms, which increase due to climate change. HERSHER: Baltimore is getting a lot more rain as the earth heats up. Extreme rainstorms - when a lot of water falls in just a few hours - have increased by about 75% since the 1950s. In 2014, extreme rain helped cause a retaining wall to collapse onto train tracks in central Baltimore. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE: (Unintelligible). HERSHER: Someone caught it on tape at the moment it crashed down. (SOUNDBITE OR ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE: (Screaming). HERSHER: Thankfully, no one was injured. But the cost to fix the damage was at least $12 million. In another instance, sea level rise and extreme rain drowned downtown in 7 feet of water. In the next 30 years, the city estimates that the portion of downtown Baltimore that will flood frequently will increase by about 150%. A quick look at the city's budget makes it clear that the billions of dollars required to fully upgrade sewers and drainage, build seawalls, reinforce roads and restore wetlands far exceeds what the city can afford on its own. And so in 2018, the mayor and City Council of Baltimore filed a lawsuit against about a dozen major oil companies, including ExxonMobil, Shell and BP. Then-city solicitor, Andre Davis, announced the suit. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)ANDRE DAVIS: These companies must be held accountable. Climate change is a reality. HERSHER: The city argues that companies should help pay for the costs of climate change because companies have known for decades that fossil fuels cause global warming. More than 20 cities and states have filed similar suits in recent years. Karen Sokol is a law professor at Loyola University New Orleans. KAREN SOKOL: These cases have the potential to be quite powerful if they finally see their day in court. HERSHER: The Supreme Court is only considering a narrow question. Where should the case be tried - in state court, as Baltimore argues, or in federal court, as the companies argue? Phil Goldberg is an attorney who represents the National Association of Manufacturers, a trade group that filed an amicus brief in support of the oil companies. PHIL GOLDBERG: This isn't something that the energy companies created. This is a byproduct of modern society. HERSHER: Goldberg says dealing with the costs of climate change is something Congress should be working on, not the courts. GOLDBERG: This litigation is really a counterproductive distraction at the end of the day for those of us who really want to get something done on the climate. HERSHER: Sokol, the law professor, says she thinks cities and states have a strong argument under state law that oil and gas companies have misled the public about the dangers of fossil fuels. If the justices decide in Baltimore's favor, she says, it will pave the way for dozens of cases to proceed across the country against the industry. SOKOL: It's never been held to account in this way in this country. It's largely wielded such tremendous economic and political might that it's never had to face a threat quite like this.

It's called the Rice's whale, and it's critically endangered. There are believed to be fewer than 100 of them left. Here's NPR's Greg Allen. GREG ALLEN, BYLINE: It was only in the 1990s that researchers determined a small whale population was living in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico year-round. Marine biologists thought they were Bryde's whales, members of a species that live in warm waters around the world. Patricia Rosel is a research geneticist with NOAA Fisheries. PATRICIA ROSEL: The first clue we had that there might be something unique came from genetic data that we collected in the mid-2000s - you know, 15 years ago now. ALLEN: That genetic data suggested this was a new species. To confirm that, Rosel and her colleagues needed morphological data, information showing that the skulls of the whales in the Gulf were different from their close relatives. They finally got that in 2019 when a whale stranded in southwest Florida. ROSEL: And through some really enormous efforts of the stranding network to respond to that dead whale when it stranded on the beach and save it and preserve it, we were finally able to look at the skull morphology and make comparisons to those other Bryde's whales in the world. ALLEN: The main difference Rosel found is a group of bones at the top of the skull. Rosel and her colleagues published their findings in Marine Mammal Science. The whale is named for Dale Rice, the marine mammal biologist who first identified the population in the Gulf. Whales can be hard to study, Rosel says, especially those like Rice's whales that don't migrate and spend most of their time far from coastlines. ROSEL: The ocean's big, you know, and so they're spread out over a big area. And you only get to see them for seconds at a time, generally, when they come up to breathe, and then they spend a lot of the rest of their time underwater. ALLEN: Along with oil spills, ocean noise and marine traffic, one of the biggest threats to the newly named species is its small population, which makes the loss of even a single whale significant.

The Biden administration promises to change that, starting with an executive order the president signed this week. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: With this executive order, environmental justice will be at the center of all we do addressing the disproportionate health and environmental and economic impacts on communities of color, so-called fenceline communities, especially those communities - brown, Black, Native American, poor whites. MARTIN: But Biden is not the first president to make such a promise. Rebecca Hersher from NPR's climate team is here with more. Good morning. REBECCA HERSHER, BYLINE: Good morning. MARTIN: What did Biden do with this new executive order? HERSHER: So the order creates a White House Council on Environmental Justice. So that council will suggest ways that the federal government can address the environmental impacts of systemic racism. And remember, the government helped create this situation? You know, discriminatory housing and zoning policies - they are the reason that people of color are more likely to live near power plants and refineries and highways, you know, things that release a lot of pollution. MARTIN: Right. HERSHER: So the federal government is promising to undo some of that. MARTIN: The federal government has promised such before, right? I mean, this isn't. . . HERSHER: Indeed. MARTIN: . . . The first time a president has acknowledged the responsibility by signing an executive order. What's going to be different? HERSHER: Honestly, you know, Biden's approach is not very different from what past presidents have done. All the way back in 1994, President Clinton signed an executive order that also created a special group to work on environmental justice. But progress has been really slow since then. You know, overall, air and water quality in the U. S. have gotten better, but the places that were most polluted in the '90s are basically the same places that are most polluted now. And that's deadly. You know, neighborhoods where people of color are exposed to chronic pollution, they're also the neighborhoods with some of the highest mortality rates from COVID-19 and some of the most severe damage from climate-driven disasters. So there are layers of environmental racism here, and they have not been fixed despite decades of federal promises. MARTIN: So what's been the effect of that, all those unmet promises on people living in these places with a lot of pollution? HERSHER: You know, people are frustrated. When you see a lot of promises, it makes you wary of new promises. I talked to a man named Devon Hall about this. He runs a local antipollution group in North Carolina. Specifically, they're trying to cut down on pollution from hog farms. So the feces from the farms, it gets in the air and the water. It makes people sick. And Black people are hit the hardest. DEVON HALL: If you look at the map, I mean, you begin to look at where these facilities is located, it's pretty much in communities of color. HERSHER: So Hall has been trying to reduce this pollution for more than 20 years. Regulators have acknowledged it's a problem, acknowledged that Black people are the ones who are suffering, even said that what's happening in Hall's home county violates the Civil Rights Act. But the pollution is still happening. And I asked Hall, like, what would he say to the new administration? And he had some questions that he thinks people in power should really ask themselves. HALL: How do you give a voice to the voiceless? How do you give those people a platform to voice their concerns? And then who's going to have a listening ear? And how long will you listen to those people that's crying out? HERSHER: He says, frankly, actions speak louder than words. MARTIN: Right. So is there a specific action the Biden administration could take beyond this executive order? HERSHER: Yeah. So Vice President Kamala Harris sponsored an environmental justice bill when she was a senator that could give more power to people like Hall. That bill could have more life now that Democrats control the Senate. And the Biden administration is also planning to spend trillions of dollars on pandemic recovery and climate change. That means jobs, infrastructure, health care, investments. So a lot of people are watching to see if that money is spent equitably. MARTIN: Rebecca Hersher with NPR's climate team. Thank you so much. HERSHER: Thanks so much. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:   People of color in this country are much more likely to breathe polluted air and drink polluted water. The Biden administration promises to change that, starting with an executive order the president signed this week. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: With this executive order, environmental justice will be at the center of all we do addressing the disproportionate health and environmental and economic impacts on communities of color, so-called fenceline communities, especially those communities - brown, Black, Native American, poor whites. MARTIN: But Biden is not the first president to make such a promise. Rebecca Hersher from NPR's climate team is here with more. Good morning. REBECCA HERSHER, BYLINE: Good morning. MARTIN: What did Biden do with this new executive order? HERSHER: So the order creates a White House Council on Environmental Justice. So that council will suggest ways that the federal government can address the environmental impacts of systemic racism. And remember, the government helped create this situation? You know, discriminatory housing and zoning policies - they are the reason that people of color are more likely to live near power plants and refineries and highways, you know, things that release a lot of pollution. MARTIN: Right. HERSHER: So the federal government is promising to undo some of that. MARTIN: The federal government has promised such before, right? I mean, this isn't. . . HERSHER: Indeed. MARTIN: . . . The first time a president has acknowledged the responsibility by signing an executive order. What's going to be different? HERSHER: Honestly, you know, Biden's approach is not very different from what past presidents have done. All the way back in 1994, President Clinton signed an executive order that also created a special group to work on environmental justice. But progress has been really slow since then. You know, overall, air and water quality in the U. S. have gotten better, but the places that were most polluted in the '90s are basically the same places that are most polluted now. And that's deadly. You know, neighborhoods where people of color are exposed to chronic pollution, they're also the neighborhoods with some of the highest mortality rates from COVID-19 and some of the most severe damage from climate-driven disasters. So there are layers of environmental racism here, and they have not been fixed despite decades of federal promises. MARTIN: So what's been the effect of that, all those unmet promises on people living in these places with a lot of pollution? HERSHER: You know, people are frustrated. When you see a lot of promises, it makes you wary of new promises. I talked to a man named Devon Hall about this. He runs a local antipollution group in North Carolina. Specifically, they're trying to cut down on pollution from hog farms. So the feces from the farms, it gets in the air and the water. It makes people sick. And Black people are hit the hardest. DEVON HALL: If you look at the map, I mean, you begin to look at where these facilities is located, it's pretty much in communities of color. HERSHER: So Hall has been trying to reduce this pollution for more than 20 years. Regulators have acknowledged it's a problem, acknowledged that Black people are the ones who are suffering, even said that what's happening in Hall's home county violates the Civil Rights Act. But the pollution is still happening. And I asked Hall, like, what would he say to the new administration? And he had some questions that he thinks people in power should really ask themselves. HALL: How do you give a voice to the voiceless? How do you give those people a platform to voice their concerns? And then who's going to have a listening ear? And how long will you listen to those people that's crying out? HERSHER: He says, frankly, actions speak louder than words. MARTIN: Right. So is there a specific action the Biden administration could take beyond this executive order? HERSHER: Yeah. So Vice President Kamala Harris sponsored an environmental justice bill when she was a senator that could give more power to people like Hall. That bill could have more life now that Democrats control the Senate. And the Biden administration is also planning to spend trillions of dollars on pandemic recovery and climate change. That means jobs, infrastructure, health care, investments. So a lot of people are watching to see if that money is spent equitably. MARTIN: Rebecca Hersher with NPR's climate team. Thank you so much.

I'm Manoush Zomorodi. And today on the show, we're giving in to things that take time, like sleep. MATT WALKER: There is no rushing sleep. One of the unusual things relative to diet or exercise is that you get to decide, do I exercise and for how long? Do I rush it? Do I not rush it? With sleep, you don't have a choice. ZOMORODI: This is Matt Walker. WALKER: I am a professor of neuroscience and psychology at the University of California, Berkeley, and I'm also the director of the Center for Human Sleep Science here at UC Berkeley. ZOMORODI: And Matt says optimizing how your brain works when you sleep - it's not really possible. WALKER: You can't just generate sleep, you know, consciously and say, OK, tonight off the menu, I'm going to actually dial up my deep sleep by an hour and a half. I think I'm going to reduce my REM sleep down maybe a little bit. I'll bring it back down to maybe just 50 minutes tonight. You can't do that. You have to let sleep unfold naturally. You have to give in to sleep and give sleep time to do all of the wonderful things that we know it does. Your brain is erupting in these incredible bursts of electrical activity going through all of these fantastic sleep stages. It's an electrical ballet that takes place at night. ZOMORODI: That electrical ballet of sleep is crucial for every aspect of our health. And when we don't make time for sleep, there are consequences. WALKER: Once you drop below seven hours, we can start to measure objective impairments in your brain and your body. The shorter your sleep, the shorter your life. Short sleep predicts all-cause mortality. ZOMORODI: We humans have evolved to need a specific amount of sleep. WALKER: It's taken Mother Nature, let's say, 3. 6 million years to put this essential need of seven to nine hours in place for the average adult. And for us to think, perhaps with a little bit of hubris, that we could come along and start to say, you know, I can train myself to survive on, let's say, just six hours or 6 1/2 hours a night. . . ZOMORODI: Yeah. WALKER: . . . It's a dangerous thing. You know, when you fight biology, you normally lose. And when you lose, the way that it's usually revealed is disease and sickness. And unfortunately, that's what we see with insufficient sleep. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ZOMORODI: So to understand the strength of a full night's sleep, we need to understand what's happening in our brains, especially during those last few hours before the alarm goes off. WALKER: When you fall asleep tonight, you're going to experience two main types of sleep. ZOMORODI: You may have heard of these before. There's rapid eye movement or REM sleep and non-REM sleep. And our brains and bodies need to cycle through both. WALKER: Approximately every 90 minutes, you go through a cycle of non-REM to REM. But what changes, however, is the ratio of non-REM to REM within those 90-minute cycles as you move across the night such that in the first half of the night, the majority of those 90-minute cycles are comprised of lots of deep sleep and very little REM sleep. But as you push through to the second half of the night, that seesaw balance actually shifts. And now you have much more rapid eye movement sleep. ZOMORODI: I mean, that is fascinating. So you can't hack this. You can't say, well, I got four or five hours of sleep. That's good enough. Like, what happens when we do skimp on sleep? Because, I mean, we all do it. WALKER: So let's say that, normally, you would sleep eight hours, but today, you want to get a jump start, and you've got an early morning meeting, or you want to get to the gym. And so instead of going to bed, let's say, at 10 p. m. and waking up at 6 a. m. , you're going to wake up at 4 a. m. (SOUNDBITE OF ALARM CLOCK RINGING)WALKER: How much sleep have you lost? Well, you've taken away two hours from your eight-hour night of sleep, so you've lost 25% of your sleep. Well, yes and no. You've lost 25% of your total sleep, but you may have lost 60, 70, 80% of all of your REM sleep because that's when you're getting your REM sleep in those last morning hours. So there are ramifications there. So what do those things do for our brain and our body? Well, firstly, what we know is that it's during deep sleep at night that your memory systems undergo a radical change. The first thing that we've learned is that you need sleep before learning to actually prepare your brain, almost like a sort of a dry sponge, ready to initially soak up new memories and lay down those sort of - those new memory traces in the brain. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)WALKER: But we've also learned that you need sleep after learning to then take those freshly minted memories in the brain and cement them and solidify them into the neural architecture of the brain. ZOMORODI: Matt Walker picks up this idea from the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)WALKER: So let me show you the data. Here in this study, we decided to test the hypothesis that pulling the all-nighter was a good idea. So we took a group of individuals, and we assigned them to one of two experimental groups - a sleep group and a sleep deprivation group. Now, the sleep group - they're going to get a full eight hours of slumber. But the deprivation group - we're going to keep them awake in the laboratory under full supervision. And then the next day, we're going to place those participants inside an MRI scanner, and we're going to have them try and learn a whole list of new facts as we're taking snapshots of brain activity. In those people who'd had a full night of sleep, we saw lots of healthy learning-related activity. Yet in those people who were sleep-deprived, we actually couldn't find any significant signal whatsoever. So it's almost as though sleep deprivation had shut down your memory inbox. And any new incoming files - they were just being bounced. Sleep will take those new memories, and it will start to integrate them and associate them with all of your past back catalog of autobiographical memories. So in other words, you wake up the next morning with a revised mind-wide web of associations, and it's sort of like group therapy for memories. ZOMORODI: (Laughter). WALKER: You know, at the end of the day, everyone gets a name badge, and then sleep gathers in all of this information. And I would argue that during deep sleep, that's taking memories and sort of improving them and strengthening them. But what dream sleep does by interconnecting them is it shifts us from knowledge, which is the individual facts, to wisdom, which is knowing what it all means when you fit it together. And I think it's probably no coincidence that you've never been told to stay awake on a problem. ZOMORODI: You know, actually, you're making me think of the saying, never go to bed angry with your partner. And actually, I have found that once I - it's better to go to bed angry 'cause then you don't have an argument 'cause when I wake up in the morning, I feel like I have a new perspective on the issue. It sounds like maybe I actually do. Maybe my brain's been working out the problem overnight. WALKER: Well, it's been working out the problem. But this brings us on to another benefit of sleep for the brain, which is that sleep provides a form of emotional first aid. Sleep provides overnight therapy. And what we've discovered is that sleep will take these difficult, painful experiences, sometimes even moving into the area of trauma. And it will act almost like a nocturnal soothing balm. And it will just take the sharp edges off those emotional memories so that when you come back the next day, they don't feel as emotional anymore. So, yes, you remember what happened yesterday, but it - you no longer regurgitate that same visceral, emotional reaction that you had at the time of the event. ZOMORODI: My saying to my kids is, sleep makes everything better. WALKER: Yeah. There is no major physiological system of the body or major operation of the brain that isn't wonderfully enhanced by sleep when we get it or demonstrably impaired when we don't get enough. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)WALKER: At this point, you may be thinking, oh, my goodness, how do I start to get better sleep? What are your tips for good sleep? Well, beyond avoiding the damaging and harmful impact of alcohol and caffeine on sleep and, if you're struggling with sleep at night, avoiding naps during the day, I have two pieces of advice for you. The first is regularity. Go to bed at the same time. Wake up at the same time, no matter whether it's the weekday or the weekend. The second is keep it cool. Your body needs to drop its core temperature by about 2 to 3 degrees Fahrenheit to initiate sleep and then to stay asleep. And it's the reason you will always find it easier to fall asleep in a room that's too cold than too hot. So aim for a bedroom temperature of around 65 degrees or about 18 degrees Celsius. That's going to be optimal for the sleep of most people. Sleep, unfortunately, is not an optional lifestyle luxury. Sleep is a non-negotiable biological necessity. It is your life support system, and it is Mother Nature's best effort yet at immortality. I believe it is now time for us to reclaim our right to a full night of sleep and without embarrassment or that unfortunate stigma of laziness. And in doing so, we can be reunited with the most powerful elixir of life. And with that, I will simply say good night, good luck, and above all, I do hope you sleep well. Thank you very much indeed. (APPLAUSE)ZOMORODI: That's Matthew Walker. He's a sleep scientist and the author of the book \"Why We Sleep. \" You can see his full talk at TED. com.

And earthlings, so far, we've been talking about the 24/7, 365 days a year kind of time. Get ready for something different. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Thrusters have been reenabled. We will control our attitude on chute. We are decelerating. ZOMORODI: This is Mission Control at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, NASA's robotics headquarters. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Phase come back again with wrist mode dynamics. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: Wrist mode is nominal. ZOMORODI: It's August 2012. And for the Curiosity rover that's been headed to Mars, it's landing day. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: We're down to 86 meters per second at an altitude of 4 kilometers. . . ZOMORODI: Rows of engineers are stationed at computers. The landing director is pacing. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: Flight, EDL, we've got some TWTA warnings. ZOMORODI: Tensions are high. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: We found a nice, flat place. We're coming in ready for sky crane. ZOMORODI: They've spent years designing and programming the rover to land safely. Now they can only watch as the data come in. NAGIN COX: You have to wait. You have to wait patiently. It's very hard to wait on landing day. ZOMORODI: That's Nagin Cox. COX: And I am an engineer at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. , and I'm the deputy team chief of the engineering operations team for the Mars 2020 rover. ZOMORODI: In the last two decades, NASA has put three rovers on Mars. Nagin has worked on all of them. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: RIMU stable. ZOMORODI: And in 2012, she's there in Mission Control, watching as the rover slowly descends. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #5: UHF is good. ZOMORODI: . . . And finally. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Touchdown confirmed. We're safe on Mars. (CHEERING)ZOMORODI: But now, for Nagin and her team of engineers, the clock really starts ticking. (SOUNDBITE OF CLOCK TICKING)COX: You know, we're landing with a multibillion-dollar asset that is priceless on the surface of Mars. And we want to make use of every minute. ZOMORODI: Which means putting the rover on a very strict schedule. COX: Power is a very important resource on Mars. So the rover sleeps at night because it takes a lot of power to do anything at night. So the rover basically wakes up at about 9:30 in the morning and receives instructions from the Earth and starts working at approximately 10 a. m. and will do activities that we have told her to do. But we are not joy-sticking this rover. It's too far. Then, you know, at around 5:30 p. m. , the rover finishes her day. And basically, when she goes to sleep, we get the data, see how her day went. And now we have the information to plan her next day. ZOMORODI: Nagin can start crunching the rover's data while the rover sleeps. But don't think of it as your typical night shift because working on Mars time is a little different. COX: So a Martian day, which we call a sol, is longer than an Earth Day. Our planet rotates in 24 hours relative to the sun. Mars rotates at a different rate. So a Martian day is approximately 24 hours and 40 minutes. ZOMORODI: Nagin Cox continues from the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)COX: So in order to come to work on the Earth at the same time every day on Mars, then we have to come in to work on the Earth 40 minutes later every day in order to stay in sync with Mars. So that's like moving a time zone every day, right? So one day you come in at 8. The next day, 40 minutes later at 8:40. The next day, 40 minutes later at 9:20. The next day at 10:00. So you keep moving 40 minutes every day until, soon, you're coming to work in the middle of the night, the middle of the Earth night, right? So you can imagine how confusing that is. Hence, the Mars watch. (LAUGHTER)COX: This watch has been mechanically - the weights have been mechanically adjusted so that it runs more slowly, right? And we didn't start out - I got this watch in 2004 when Spirit and Opportunity, the rovers back then - we didn't start out thinking that we were going to need Mars watches, right? We thought, OK, we'll just have the time on our computers and on the mission control screens and that would be enough. Yeah, not so much. Because we weren't just working on Mars time, we were actually living on Mars time. And we got just instantaneously. . . ZOMORODI: I mean, it sounds like, oh, it's just a 40-minute difference, but over a 90-day mission, that can add up and, I assume, be pretty disorienting. COX: Yeah. So the minute you have to shift your sleep cycle and are moving in time, you also need to eliminate the cues of what is Earth time. So it started with shades and blinds and things to keep us from seeing the Earth daylight. Because if we had rotated to the point where it was night on Mars, but daylight on the Earth, we didn't want the daylight to come in and mess up our body clocks. And not just our body clocks, but also our mental sense of where we were. ZOMORODI: Hmm. COX: And it even started to spread into our language. I distinctly remember someone walking up to me and saying, hey, Nagin, we need to do this activity on the vehicle tomorrow. And I absolutely said, uh, which tomorrow? Tomorrow tomorrow or Mars tomorrow? ZOMORODI: (Laughter) So how do you solve for that? COX: So a lot of this was tied to how can we get our jobs done in the most efficient way? And again, that was coming up with words that would make it clear quickly, you know, what planet we were talking about. Were we talking about the Earth or Mars? And so if a day on Mars is a sol, then tomorrow becomes nextersol and yesterday becomes yestersol. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)COX: So we have the watches and the language. And one of the things that we all discovered is you can get anywhere in Los Angeles at 3:00 in the morning when there's no traffic. (LAUGHTER)COX: So we would get off work, and we - instead of going - you know, we didn't want to go home and bother our families. And we were hungry, so instead of going, you know, locally to eat something, we'd go, wait, there's this great all-night deli in Long Beach, and we can get there in, like, 10 minutes. So we would drive down. It was, like, the '60s - right? - no traffic. We would drive down there, and the restaurant owners would go, who are you people? (LAUGHTER)COX: And why are you at my restaurant at 3 in the morning? So they came to realize that there were these packs of Martians. . . (LAUGHTER)COX: . . . Roaming the L. A. freeways in the middle of the night. And we did actually start calling ourselves Martians. So those of us who were on Mars time, we would refer to ourselves as Martians and everyone else as earthlings. (LAUGHTER)COX: And that's because when you're moving a time zone every day, you start to really feel separated from everyone else. You're literally in your own world. ZOMORODI: I can only imagine that that had kind of a wonderful effect on your relationships with your colleagues. Like, having worked in a newsroom, there's a lingo, right? You all speak the same language, and it - there's a shorthand, and you can move through information so much more quickly. Did it have that? Did it bring you together in some ways as a team when you started to be living on a different planet, at least in terms of what time it was and the vocabulary that you used? COX: It absolutely did in ways that we didn't expect. The isolation, the sense of separation from even your family, your friends, other colleagues who aren't working this mission sets in pretty quickly. And most of that is due to the time. You are very quickly shifted from them. Your experience becomes extremely focused on what happens on Mars. You don't have any idea what time it is on Earth because we're trying to get rid of the cues. You don't even remember what day it is on Earth. You remember what sol it is because your mind is constantly projecting you to Mars. So the people that you're sharing this experience with will always be the humans that you experience Mars time with. ZOMORODI: You know, this episode is all about topics or things that you cannot rush. They take time. That's, you know, from sloths to bridges made of roots to the amount of time that we need to sleep to be healthy human beings. And I guess I wonder, you know, for me, these conversations are making me want to slow down, to not rush things. And I wonder if there are some lessons of from when you've been on Mars time that you've taken back to when you are on Earth time. COX: Certainly, Mars time reminds you of - it makes you not take time for granted. You look at time differently because we've changed it. And when you are someplace on Mars exploring for all of humankind, it is a different rhythm. We are there to look around, to explore, to go slowly, to get our job done, which does mean we have distance to cover. But the ability to get from one location to another but then to stop and look at what we're doing - it is the rhythm of humanity-scale exploration. ZOMORODI: That's Nagin Cox. She's an operations engineer at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and a deputy team chief for the Mars 2020 Perseverance Rover, which is set to land February 18. You can learn more about the mission at jpl. nasa. gov, and you can watch Nagin's full talk at ted. com. MANOUSH ZOMORODI, HOST:   On the show today, it takes time. And earthlings, so far, we've been talking about the 24/7, 365 days a year kind of time. Get ready for something different. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Thrusters have been reenabled. We will control our attitude on chute. We are decelerating. ZOMORODI: This is Mission Control at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, NASA's robotics headquarters. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Phase come back again with wrist mode dynamics. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: Wrist mode is nominal. ZOMORODI: It's August 2012. And for the Curiosity rover that's been headed to Mars, it's landing day. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: We're down to 86 meters per second at an altitude of 4 kilometers. . . ZOMORODI: Rows of engineers are stationed at computers. The landing director is pacing. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: Flight, EDL, we've got some TWTA warnings. ZOMORODI: Tensions are high. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: We found a nice, flat place. We're coming in ready for sky crane. ZOMORODI: They've spent years designing and programming the rover to land safely. Now they can only watch as the data come in. NAGIN COX: You have to wait. You have to wait patiently. It's very hard to wait on landing day. ZOMORODI: That's Nagin Cox. COX: And I am an engineer at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. , and I'm the deputy team chief of the engineering operations team for the Mars 2020 rover. ZOMORODI: In the last two decades, NASA has put three rovers on Mars. Nagin has worked on all of them. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: RIMU stable. ZOMORODI: And in 2012, she's there in Mission Control, watching as the rover slowly descends. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #5: UHF is good. ZOMORODI: . . . And finally. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Touchdown confirmed. We're safe on Mars. (CHEERING) ZOMORODI: But now, for Nagin and her team of engineers, the clock really starts ticking. (SOUNDBITE OF CLOCK TICKING) COX: You know, we're landing with a multibillion-dollar asset that is priceless on the surface of Mars. And we want to make use of every minute. ZOMORODI: Which means putting the rover on a very strict schedule. COX: Power is a very important resource on Mars. So the rover sleeps at night because it takes a lot of power to do anything at night. So the rover basically wakes up at about 9:30 in the morning and receives instructions from the Earth and starts working at approximately 10 a. m. and will do activities that we have told her to do. But we are not joy-sticking this rover. It's too far. Then, you know, at around 5:30 p. m. , the rover finishes her day. And basically, when she goes to sleep, we get the data, see how her day went. And now we have the information to plan her next day. ZOMORODI: Nagin can start crunching the rover's data while the rover sleeps. But don't think of it as your typical night shift because working on Mars time is a little different. COX: So a Martian day, which we call a sol, is longer than an Earth Day. Our planet rotates in 24 hours relative to the sun. Mars rotates at a different rate. So a Martian day is approximately 24 hours and 40 minutes. ZOMORODI: Nagin Cox continues from the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) COX: So in order to come to work on the Earth at the same time every day on Mars, then we have to come in to work on the Earth 40 minutes later every day in order to stay in sync with Mars. So that's like moving a time zone every day, right? So one day you come in at 8. The next day, 40 minutes later at 8:40. The next day, 40 minutes later at 9:20. The next day at 10:00. So you keep moving 40 minutes every day until, soon, you're coming to work in the middle of the night, the middle of the Earth night, right? So you can imagine how confusing that is. Hence, the Mars watch. (LAUGHTER) COX: This watch has been mechanically - the weights have been mechanically adjusted so that it runs more slowly, right? And we didn't start out - I got this watch in 2004 when Spirit and Opportunity, the rovers back then - we didn't start out thinking that we were going to need Mars watches, right? We thought, OK, we'll just have the time on our computers and on the mission control screens and that would be enough. Yeah, not so much. Because we weren't just working on Mars time, we were actually living on Mars time. And we got just instantaneously. . . ZOMORODI: I mean, it sounds like, oh, it's just a 40-minute difference, but over a 90-day mission, that can add up and, I assume, be pretty disorienting. COX: Yeah. So the minute you have to shift your sleep cycle and are moving in time, you also need to eliminate the cues of what is Earth time. So it started with shades and blinds and things to keep us from seeing the Earth daylight. Because if we had rotated to the point where it was night on Mars, but daylight on the Earth, we didn't want the daylight to come in and mess up our body clocks. And not just our body clocks, but also our mental sense of where we were. ZOMORODI: Hmm. COX: And it even started to spread into our language. I distinctly remember someone walking up to me and saying, hey, Nagin, we need to do this activity on the vehicle tomorrow. And I absolutely said, uh, which tomorrow? Tomorrow tomorrow or Mars tomorrow? ZOMORODI: (Laughter) So how do you solve for that? COX: So a lot of this was tied to how can we get our jobs done in the most efficient way?

I'm Manoush Zomorodi. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ZOMORODI: And on the show today, we are surrendering to things that take time. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ZOMORODI: And let's start with a moment or two appreciating the slowest mammal in the world. LUCY COOKE: There is no other animal like them on the planet. (SOUNDBITE OF SLOTH SQUEAK)ZOMORODI: The sloth. COOKE: There is no other animal that comes with a built-in philosophy. (SOUNDBITE OF SLOTH SQUEAK)ZOMORODI: This is Lucy Cooke. COOKE: And I am a writer, broadcaster, conservationist, zoologist. I wear a lot of hats. But mostly, I'm known for being a huge advocate of sloths. (SOUNDBITE OF SLOTH SQUEAK)ZOMORODI: So, Lucy, do you remember the first time you saw a sloth in person? COOKE: I do. I do. I was traveling around South America trying to raise awareness about endangered amphibians. And the one non-frog-based thing that I did was visit a sanctuary in Costa Rica, and I was not disappointed (laughter). I - it was love at first sight. I was just. . . ZOMORODI: Wow. COOKE: . . . Mesmerized by their strangeness because they are - they really are slow. And that's quite stunning. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)COOKE: They are extraordinarily graceful. They really do move like a ballet dancer that's been slowed down. You know, it's like they have this incredible control. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)COOKE: And what's kind of amazing about that is they actually manage to move so gracefully with 50% less muscle mass than most upright mammals. So, you know, for the zoologists, you're just - your brain's just working overtime, going, how does that work and why, why, why, you know? (Laughter). (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ZOMORODI: That was back in 2010. And Lucy has, since then, been obsessed with sloths. COOKE: This is a lifelong commitment I've made (laughter). You know, it would be churlish and inappropriate to have a fleeting fancy with the sloth, wouldn't it? ZOMORODI: We live in an era of instant gratification, a culture that prizes efficiency over patience. But some things, to reach their full potential, they simply cannot be rushed. Optimizing or speeding them up is impossible. And given how the past year has warped our sense of time, perhaps we're ready to value a different tempo. And so today on the show, ideas and projects that take time - how a more deliberate pace can be productive if we revel in it or if we observe how another creature embraces it, like the sloths. Lucy Cooke says that living in slow motion is the ultimate evolutionary adaptation. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)COOKE: Sloths are completely perfect. They're as perfect as you or I, and they're perfectly adapted to their arboreal lifestyle. And they are rather unusual because they are the world's only inverted quadrupeds. So they are a four-legged animal that lives most of its life upside down. And there are two different types of sloth. You have two-toed sloths, and they're the ones that look basically like a cross between a Wookiee and a pig, actually. They've got this sort of really kind of boopable (ph), kind of pig-like nose and sort of beige-brown fur. And then you have your three-toed sloths, and they're the ones that have got, like, a sort of a band across their eyes, and they've got kind of medieval haircuts and Mona Lisa smiles. And they're quite different. They're actually as genetically different as cats and dogs. ZOMORODI: Really? COOKE: Yeah. Yeah. 'Cause the sloths were once a huge group. There were, like, sort of over 50 species, including giant ground sloths and all sorts. So the ones that are left, they're from that group, but they're all the small ones that live in trees, basically - are the ones that survived. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ZOMORODI: And Lucy says the secret to their survival is their metabolism. COOKE: Fundamentally, they're vegetarians, and they live on leaves. But, you know, leaves don't want to be eaten any more than antelope do, you know, so they're loaded full of toxins. And so in order to digest those leaves, sloths have a very slow digestion rate - takes them up to a month to digest a single leaf. ZOMORODI: Wow. COOKE: Yeah. ZOMORODI: Lucy Cooke continues from the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)COOKE: Sloths have a freakishly low metabolism. And we think that this might be one of the reasons that they can sometimes recover from injuries that would kill most animals. This sloth recovered from a double amputation, and I've known sloths that have managed to survive even power line electrocutions. And we now think that a low metabolism may well be key to surviving extinction. Researchers at Kansas University who were studying mollusks found that a high metabolism predicted which species of mollusk had gone extinct. Sloths have been around on this planet in one shape or another for over 40 million years. The secret to their success is their slothful nature. They are energy-saving icons. This is a creature that everything about it is shaped around burning very little energy - slow digestion, slow metabolism - and so they have all these adaptations to living on a very low-energy diet, which is, you know, having a very slow metabolism and living upside down, for example. That requires less energy and less muscle just to dangle from a tree. ZOMORODI: Go with gravity. COOKE: Yeah, exactly. Go with gravity 100%. If you got the option, hang out from a tree like a happy, hairy hammock. It ain't - it's going to save you a lot of energy if you can. If you can, do it. ZOMORODI: So what is a sloth's kind of ideal day? COOKE: They basically spend their entire day waking, snacking, snoozing, repeat. ZOMORODI: Sounds so good. COOKE: Yeah. And then once a week, a major event happens, and that's the need to take a poop. ZOMORODI: Nice. COOKE: (Laughter) And then they'll climb a great - this laborious climb down from a tree in order to do their business at the bottom of a tree, which is a conundrum that has mystified scientists for many, many years because why would you do that? Because when you come to the ground, you're completely vulnerable and, you know, could get attacked by jaguars and ocelots or whatever. We think that they do it in order to send love messages to. . . ZOMORODI: Oh. COOKE: . . . Other sloths. I know. It doesn't sound terribly romantic to us. ZOMORODI: No. COOKE: But yes, you know, romance is a latrine-based sport, if you're a sloth. ZOMORODI: (Laughter). (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)COOKE: Now, this risky and energetic behavior has long been a mystery, and there are lots of theories as to why they do it. But I think they're leaving surreptitious scented messages for potential mates because, you see - sloths are generally silent, solitary creatures, except for when the female is in heat. She will climb to the top of a tree and scream for sex in D-sharp. (LAUGHTER)COOKE: Don't believe me? (SOUNDBITE OF SLOTH SCREAM)COOKE: D-sharp. This and only this note will get the male's attention. It mimics the sound of the kiskadee flycatcher. So the female remains covert, even when yodeling for sex at the top of her lungs. Her clandestine booty calls will carry for miles across the canopy, and males will beat a slow path towards her. (LAUGHTER)COOKE: I think scented messages in her dung will help send Romeo up the right tree so that he doesn't waste precious energy scaling the wrong one. Sex, by the way, is the only thing that sloths do swiftly. I've seen them do it in the wild, and it's over and done with in a matter of seconds. But then why waste precious energy on it, particularly after that journey? ZOMORODI: (Laughter) So how has this world's slowest mammal been able to survive for millions of years? Because it's not like they can outrun predators. COOKE: Well, do you know what? That was exactly the same question that the early naturalists were completely, like, befuddled by this creature because they're like, how does it escape from being eaten? Like, how does that happen, you know? But actually, it just - it doesn't escape by running away. It escapes by being cryptic, you see. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)COOKE: So their fur actually has grooves in it that traps moisture and allows algae to grow so that they often have a greenish hue, the wild sloths. So they totally blend in with the trees. They look and smell just like a tree. So they - and its movements are so slow that we think that they pass under the radar of the harpy eagle, which is their main predator, as they fly around the treetops scanning for motion. You know, they don't crash around and make a load of noise like monkeys do. They're really hard to spot because they're silent and solitary and totally camouflaged. So that's how they've done it, really. It's just a different way, you know, which I find very pleasing. ZOMORODI: When I first think of the word sloth, it's related to idle and laziness and being a bit of a heathen - right? like, a sinner, as it were. But the sloth has had sort of a makeover in the last few years. Why has it changed from being the emblem of all that is idle to this lovable creature who kind of symbolizes a simpler, kinder, slower way of life? COOKE: Well, I think that when I first stumbled across them 10 years ago, nobody had really heard of them. And then now they are everywhere, you know, for sure. And I think to a certain extent, I'd like to think that we are all becoming aware that our lives as humans are unsustainable. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)COOKE: And maybe we're fed up with moving too fast and being in the rat race and running in a hamster wheel every single day to what end, you know? And maybe this having been something that was considered to be a sin, you know, is now an aspirational quality, the idea that you could be slow, and that would be OK. So yeah, I mean, you know, it's cheesy, but I think taking a leaf out of the - a slowly digested leaf out of the sloth's book is - isn't a bad thing to do. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ZOMORODI: That's Lucy Cooke. She's a zoologist, author and founder of the Sloth Appreciation Society. You can hear her full talk at ted. com. On the show today, it takes time - how some things you just can't rush. I'm Manoush Zomorodi, and you're listening to the TED Radio Hour from NPR. Stay with us.

ZOMORODI: Oh. COOKE: . . . Other sloths. I know. It doesn't sound terribly romantic to us. ZOMORODI: No. COOKE: But yes, you know, romance is a latrine-based sport, if you're a sloth. ZOMORODI: (Laughter). (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) COOKE: Now, this risky and energetic behavior has long been a mystery, and there are lots of theories as to why they do it. But I think they're leaving surreptitious scented messages for potential mates because, you see - sloths are generally silent, solitary creatures, except for when the female is in heat. She will climb to the top of a tree and scream for sex in D-sharp. (LAUGHTER) COOKE: Don't believe me? (SOUNDBITE OF SLOTH SCREAM) COOKE: D-sharp. This and only this note will get the male's attention. It mimics the sound of the kiskadee flycatcher. So the female remains covert, even when yodeling for sex at the top of her lungs. Her clandestine booty calls will carry for miles across the canopy, and males will beat a slow path towards her. (LAUGHTER) COOKE: I think scented messages in her dung will help send Romeo up the right tree so that he doesn't waste precious energy scaling the wrong one. Sex, by the way, is the only thing that sloths do swiftly. I've seen them do it in the wild, and it's over and done with in a matter of seconds. But then why waste precious energy on it, particularly after that journey? ZOMORODI: (Laughter) So how has this world's slowest mammal been able to survive for millions of years? Because it's not like they can outrun predators. COOKE: Well, do you know what? That was exactly the same question that the early naturalists were completely, like, befuddled by this creature because they're like, how does it escape from being eaten? Like, how does that happen, you know? But actually, it just - it doesn't escape by running away. It escapes by being cryptic, you see. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) COOKE: So their fur actually has grooves in it that traps moisture and allows algae to grow so that they often have a greenish hue, the wild sloths. So they totally blend in with the trees. They look and smell just like a tree. So they - and its movements are so slow that we think that they pass under the radar of the harpy eagle, which is their main predator, as they fly around the treetops scanning for motion. You know, they don't crash around and make a load of noise like monkeys do. They're really hard to spot because they're silent and solitary and totally camouflaged. So that's how they've done it, really. It's just a different way, you know, which I find very pleasing. ZOMORODI: When I first think of the word sloth, it's related to idle and laziness and being a bit of a heathen - right? like, a sinner, as it were. But the sloth has had sort of a makeover in the last few years. Why has it changed from being the emblem of all that is idle to this lovable creature who kind of symbolizes a simpler, kinder, slower way of life? COOKE: Well, I think that when I first stumbled across them 10 years ago, nobody had really heard of them. And then now they are everywhere, you know, for sure. And I think to a certain extent, I'd like to think that we are all becoming aware that our lives as humans are unsustainable. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) COOKE: And maybe we're fed up with moving too fast and being in the rat race and running in a hamster wheel every single day to what end, you know? And maybe this having been something that was considered to be a sin, you know, is now an aspirational quality, the idea that you could be slow, and that would be OK. So yeah, I mean, you know, it's cheesy, but I think taking a leaf out of the - a slowly digested leaf out of the sloth's book is - isn't a bad thing to do. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ZOMORODI: That's Lucy Cooke. She's a zoologist, author and founder of the Sloth Appreciation Society. You can hear her full talk at ted. com.

NPR's Joe Palca has a report. JOE PALCA, BYLINE: Let's say you've been working on a space mission for years. And finally, finally, it's about to arrive at its destination. How do you imagine you'd feel? OMRAN SHARAF: Excited, proud, but also, like, stressed and worried. PALCA: Omran Sharaf is the Emirates Mars Mission project director. SHARAF: Confident - it's a mix of feelings. PALCA: Confident because so far, everything is going extremely well with the mission. The probe left Earth last July. And with a few mid-course tweaks, the 1. 5-ton probe called Hope is spot on target to enter orbit around Mars. But deep space missions, especially the ones headed for Mars, can go from fine to failure in less time than it takes you to say, Houston, we've got a problem. Sarah Al Amiri is head of the UAE space agency. She says it is ever thus. SARAH BINT YOUSIF AL AMIRI: Everything rests on a single moment. So is launch successful? OK, you're up in the air. Is the first stage separating? OK, it's separated. Is second stage separating? So you go on an emotional rollercoaster during a short amount of time. PALCA: The next ride on the roller coaster comes at 10:30 Eastern time Tuesday morning. Hope's engines are to fire for 27 minutes so the spacecraft can be captured by Mars' gravity and go into orbit. If they don't, Hope just zooms on by. Now, there have been plenty of orbital missions to Mars, and most of them go into an orbit that's just a couple hundred miles above the surface. BETHANY EHLMANN: The Emirates Mars Mission has this super clever orbit where they're actually further out. PALCA: Bethany Ehlmann is a professor of planetary science at Caltech and president of the Planetary Society. Ehlmann says Hope's orbit will allow it to study Martian weather in a new way, since it can watch a large swath of the planet for hours at a time. EHLMANN: No satellite in Mars' orbit that does this - we don't have a weather satellite. So we don't really actually quite understand what the Martian weather is like, like, how things vary over the course of a day. PALCA: Ehlmann says the Hope probe also has instruments that can look at the big picture of what's going on in the planet's atmosphere. EHLMANN: But they're going to get atmospheric data that we've never seen before. PALCA: But as much as the mission is designed to improve the scientific understanding of Mars, there's another purpose - to demonstrate the UAE's ability to carry out a technically complex mission and get younger Emiratis excited about math, science and engineering. Advanced Technology Minister Sarah Al Amiri says children are getting the message. AL AMIRI: And that goes down to my 4-year-old who knows where Mars is. And I never recall in my lifetime seeing children going out, looking up at the sky and saying that's Mars, and we have a mission arriving there.

I listen to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED in the car with mom. I never hear much about nature or dinosaurs or things like that. Maybe you should call your show Newsy Things Considered since I don't get to hear about all the things, or please talk more about dinosaurs and cool things. Sincerely, Leo.

By comparison, we looked, and the word senator has appeared in 20,447 pieces. I'm actually surprised it's not more. So we think it might be time to shake things up. Hi, Leo. LEO: Hi.

KELLY: I'm so glad to be able to connect you two because, Leo, can I start by just saying I hear from your parents that you want to be a paleontologist when you grow up? And now we've got one on the line for you. LEO: OK. KELLY: (Laughter) So let me let you ask a question. What's your top question that you want to put to Ashley Poust about dinosaurs? LEO: What is your favorite part of the job? And have you discovered a dinosaur? POUST: Well, the thing that's the coolest for me is discovery. LEO: Have you discovered a dinosaur? POUST: I have. I hope to find many more in the future, but I've been able to name a few really cool fossil animals. I recently named a dinosaur Wulong, from China, and that was discovered by farmers. KELLY: Anything you want to know about your favorite dinosaur? LEO: Sure. How large was Concavenator? POUST: Concavenator itself - it's a little smaller than, say, your T. rex or your Spinosaurus. A really tall person might have been able to look it in the eye. But if it reared up, it could easily shadow you, and it would be really scary. LEO: How did dinosaurs grow to be so big? And why aren't humans and mammals the size of dinosaurs today? POUST: I love this question. This is hard-hitting journalism 'cause these are the types of questions that keep paleontologists up at night. One thing is that dinosaurs are built different. They have weird bones compared to mammals. Giant longneck dinosaurs, sauropods, actually have huge holes that are filled with potentially airlike sacs. And so that lightens their bodies and maybe gives them structural strength. They also grow different. And so mammals, of course, don't come from eggs. We have to raise them, and we're famously dependent on our parents. Maybe dinosaurs could lay lots of eggs and leave them and go lay lots of eggs somewhere else. They also grew really quickly. And so maybe they're able to grow to these enormous sizes by being pretty active. And that's one of my favorite areas of research. So they were built different. They grow different. But maybe they're not that different. Mammals get pretty big. Whales that are alive today are as big as anything the dinosaurs ever produced. And so don't sleep on whales. KELLY: Well, that's Ashley Poust of the San Diego Natural History Museum sharing his expertise and our 8-year-old listener Leo Shidla of Minneapolis.

So researchers are using genetic material taken from those fossils to study how the human brain evolved. NPR's Jon Hamilton reports on an effort to grow human brain cells containing an ancient gene. JON HAMILTON, BYLINE: The gene is called NOVA1. It's among the genes that have changed significantly since Neanderthals roamed the Earth. Alysson Muotri of the University of California, San Diego says NOVA1 plays an important role in brain development. ALYSSON MUOTRI: So that gene would be perfect to start measuring if they can change the way the brain develops. HAMILTON: To find out, Muotri and his team turned to brain organoids, or mini brains. They're tiny spheres of human brain tissue that grow in the lab and mimic early brain development. But Muotri says existing organoids only had the modern version of the NOVA1 gene. MUOTRI: So we swap the archaic version for the modern version. HAMILTON: And the team started growing organoids carrying this archaic gene. Muotri says they were clearly different. MUOTRI: The archaic version of the gene changes the way the shape of these organoids are formed. HAMILTON: The surface of each sphere was uneven instead of smooth. Also, Muotri says, individual cells behave differently. MUOTRI: The archaic version of the brain organoid, we see an acceleration of maturation. So the neurons start to get more active at very early stages compared to modern humans. HAMILTON: A brain that matures quickly is more capable at birth, but it's less likely to continue developing during childhood, the period when modern humans acquire important social skills. Muotri says there's probably a reason why humans with the new variant of NOVA1 survived while those with the old version died out. MUOTRI: It might suggest that sometime during evolution, we acquired that mutation, and it bring us tremendous advantage to be able to have this complex brain later in life. HAMILTON: That idea is consistent with what some other scientists have learned from studying ancient genes in a different way. Dr. Karen Berman of the National Institute of Mental Health is part of a team that's been studying the Neanderthal genes that are still present in many humans, especially those of European and East Asian ancestry. KAREN BERMAN: It's very exciting to be able to use our knowledge of archaic DNA to really explore what makes us who and what we are. HAMILTON: Berman says people with more Neanderthal genetic material tend to have skulls more like those of Neanderthals. And she says there are hints that Neanderthal genes emphasized brain networks devoted to visual and spatial abilities rather than social interactions. BERMAN: It may have been the lack of these social networks that led to the Neanderthal dying out. HAMILTON: Berman's research partner, Dr. Michael Gregory, says it's easy to imagine how Neanderthal brains could have become outdated. MICHAEL GREGORY: If they went foraging for foods or hunting, they could find their way back and forth to different places better. But they couldn't form groups quite as well, in theory, to fight common predators or something like that. HAMILTON: And group cooperation has been critical to the success of modern humans. But Gregory, a psychiatrist, says all this research on ancient brains is about more than human history. GREGORY: The thing that drives us is not just how did things happen to develop over time and over evolution, but also how did they go awry and cause neuropsychiatric diseases, and why? HAMILTON: Gregory hopes that by answering those questions, scientists will be able to develop better treatments for problems like schizophrenia and autism. The new research appears in the journal Science. Jon Hamilton, NPR News. (SOUNDBITE OF GRAMATIK'S \"MUY TRANQUILO\") AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:   Fossils have provided a detailed record of early human skulls, but not the brains inside them. So researchers are using genetic material taken from those fossils to study how the human brain evolved. NPR's Jon Hamilton reports on an effort to grow human brain cells containing an ancient gene. JON HAMILTON, BYLINE: The gene is called NOVA1. It's among the genes that have changed significantly since Neanderthals roamed the Earth. Alysson Muotri of the University of California, San Diego says NOVA1 plays an important role in brain development. ALYSSON MUOTRI: So that gene would be perfect to start measuring if they can change the way the brain develops. HAMILTON: To find out, Muotri and his team turned to brain organoids, or mini brains. They're tiny spheres of human brain tissue that grow in the lab and mimic early brain development. But Muotri says existing organoids only had the modern version of the NOVA1 gene. MUOTRI: So we swap the archaic version for the modern version. HAMILTON: And the team started growing organoids carrying this archaic gene. Muotri says they were clearly different. MUOTRI: The archaic version of the gene changes the way the shape of these organoids are formed. HAMILTON: The surface of each sphere was uneven instead of smooth. Also, Muotri says, individual cells behave differently. MUOTRI: The archaic version of the brain organoid, we see an acceleration of maturation. So the neurons start to get more active at very early stages compared to modern humans. HAMILTON: A brain that matures quickly is more capable at birth, but it's less likely to continue developing during childhood, the period when modern humans acquire important social skills. Muotri says there's probably a reason why humans with the new variant of NOVA1 survived while those with the old version died out. MUOTRI: It might suggest that sometime during evolution, we acquired that mutation, and it bring us tremendous advantage to be able to have this complex brain later in life. HAMILTON: That idea is consistent with what some other scientists have learned from studying ancient genes in a different way. Dr. Karen Berman of the National Institute of Mental Health is part of a team that's been studying the Neanderthal genes that are still present in many humans, especially those of European and East Asian ancestry. KAREN BERMAN: It's very exciting to be able to use our knowledge of archaic DNA to really explore what makes us who and what we are. HAMILTON: Berman says people with more Neanderthal genetic material tend to have skulls more like those of Neanderthals. And she says there are hints that Neanderthal genes emphasized brain networks devoted to visual and spatial abilities rather than social interactions. BERMAN: It may have been the lack of these social networks that led to the Neanderthal dying out. HAMILTON: Berman's research partner, Dr. Michael Gregory, says it's easy to imagine how Neanderthal brains could have become outdated. MICHAEL GREGORY: If they went foraging for foods or hunting, they could find their way back and forth to different places better.

They were first identified in other countries before being detected here in the U. S. But the virus has also been evolving here. As we heard earlier in this program, yesterday, scientists reported seven new homegrown variants. To tell us more about these strains, we're joined now by NPR's Rhitu ChatterjeeHey, Rhitu. RHITU CHATTERJEE, BYLINE: Hey, Ailsa. CHANG: So the way I understand it, these seven variants all have, like, a similar mutation, right? CHATTERJEE: That's right. These variants evolved independently in different parts of the country, but they do all have a similar mutation. And it's in the spike protein of the virus. Remember; the spike protein is what helps the virus infect the host cell - human cells in this case. And it works sort of like a harpoon, helping the virus attach to the surface of cells in our bodies and then inject the genetic material into the cells so that it can replicate and make more viruses. CHANG: But do scientists know what these mutations do? I mean, do they make the virus more infectious or deadlier in any way? CHATTERJEE: The short answer is we don't know. I spoke with the main author of the study, Jeremy Kamil at Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center. And I asked him, should we be more concerned about these new variants? And here's what he said. JEREMY KAMIL: Definitely don't panic anyone. There's no reason to think it'd be more deadly. If there's a difference in transmissibility, it would probably be a small one that really wouldn't - shouldn't concern the average member of the public. CHATTERJEE: Yeah. And as he puts it, he thinks this is just the - you know, these mutations are just part of the virus' course of evolution. And as it infects more humans, it'll just keep mutating. And not all mutations will be harmful to humans, whereas others - a few might. And another researcher I spoke with who wasn't involved in the study said that because these American variants evolved independently and yet have similar mutations, it's likely that the mutations do offer some benefit to the virus. But he says it's too early to know with these strains. CHANG: OK, so at this point, there's no reason to think that these strains might make vaccines less effective. Yeah? CHATTERJEE: That's correct. The researchers I spoke to aren't really worried about it, but what they are concerned about is that variants will continue to emerge around the country and that the U. S. needs to have a nationally coordinated effort to track the virus. Dr. Jeremy Luban is at the University of Massachusetts Medical School. He wasn't involved in the new study, but he told me that other countries are doing a much better job at tracking the virus. JEREMY LUBAN: The United Kingdom, for example, has had extremely extensive investigations of the virus as it spreads through the population. I think about 10% of all of the infections in England have been - actually been sequenced and assessed. CHATTERJEE: The U. S. , on the other hand, he says, is just scrambling to catch up to where it needs to be to better monitor the virus. CHANG: And I imagine, I mean, if there is a virant (ph) that is more - a variant that is more dangerous, we want to know as soon as possible, right? CHATTERJEE: Exactly. You know, he was talking about the U. K. And new data from that country suggests that the variant that was first identified there is not only spreading faster but may make people sicker. So it's important to keep sequencing, and that'll also help vaccine companies to tweak vaccines when necessary to keep them effective against worrisome new strains.

NPR science correspondent Richard Harris reports on what's left to learn and what information will be harder to get. RICHARD HARRIS, BYLINE: A mix of altruism and self-interest drove people to volunteer to take experimental COVID vaccines. Karen Mott, a 56-year-old job counselor who lives in the Kansas City area, says she signed up because she wanted to do her part to end the pandemic. KAREN MOTT: I've been taking prescription medicine for the last 25 years. And somebody has done this type of stuff before for me, so I felt it was kind of my way of giving back. HARRIS: Mott got a strong reaction to the second shot, so she correctly guessed that she had received the vaccine, not the placebo. And she was sad to read that one of the volunteers in the placebo group did die of COVID. MOTT: I keep thinking about that, you know, just, why am I one of the lucky ones? And I think that makes me feel like, yeah, I need to continue providing the information that we need. HARRIS: So when the clinic summoned her in January and offered to reveal her actual vaccine status, which is called unblinding, it was an easy call for her. MOTT: And I chose, you know, please unblind me and that I want to stay in the study to provide additional data for you guys. HARRIS: Vaccine scientists hope that the volunteers will stay in the study for two years. Participants provide periodic nose swabs and sometimes saliva samples to see if they've been infected. And they also give blood so scientists can better understand how the vaccine is providing protection. Mott was one of about 650 volunteers who took the experimental Moderna vaccine at a company called Johnson County Clinical Trials (ph) in Lenexa, Kan. Dr. Carlos Fierro, who runs the study there, says every participant was called back after the Food and Drug Administration authorized the vaccine. CARLOS FIERRO: During that visit, we discussed the options, which included stay in the study without receiving the vaccine. And amazingly, there were people - a couple of people who chose that. HARRIS: He suspects those individuals got spooked by rumors about the vaccine. But everybody else who had the placebo shot went ahead and got the actual vaccine. So now Fierro has essentially no comparison group left for the ongoing study. FIERRO: It's a loss from a scientific standpoint. But given the circumstances, I think it's the right thing to do. HARRIS: People signing up for these studies were not promised special treatment. But once the FDA authorized the drugs, vaccine developers decided to offer the shots. Dr. Steven Goodman at Stanford University says losing those control groups makes it more difficult to answer some important questions about COVID vaccines. STEVEN GOODMAN: So we don't know how long protection lasts. We don't know the efficacy against variants, for which we desperately need a good control arm. And we also don't know if there are any differences in any of these parameters by age or race or infirmity. HARRIS: Goodman is also thinking about what future studies will look like, considering the ethics of providing a placebo to people when there are effective vaccines. Participants might have to be in groups that are not currently eligible for a vaccine or who live in other parts of the world where vaccines simply aren't available. And he says the appearance of virus variants is a wild card. GOODMAN: It may really scramble things up because there are certain variants where the efficacy of all vaccines might be so low that we're basically back to zero and that we might have to go back to placebo-controlled trials.

CHANG: Love Dalen is at the Center for Paleogenetics in Stockholm, and he says this mammoth DNA is twice as old as the previous record holder, which came from an ancient horse. CHANG: Now, sequencing million-year-old DNA like this was impossible just a few years ago. Samples that old were just too small to work with. Now researchers can see incredibly small samples, but it's challenging to put them together. Tom van der Valk also works with the Center for Paleogenetics. TOM VAN DER VALK: Imagine if your DNA is fragmented into literally millions of tiny pieces. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:  It is a painstaking puzzle. DALEN: And it's not only one puzzle. It's actually multiple puzzles. So imagine, you know, you have one puzzle for the mammoth genome, but then you have another puzzle for the whole bacterial content of these samples, and you have another puzzle for the human DNA for the paleontologists and us in the lab. SHAPIRO: Well, once they had finished sorting out the mammoth bits, the DNA gave the scientists a unique window into mammoth evolution. Dalen says the standard view holds there was only one mammoth species in Siberia a couple million years ago. DALEN: What we find now is that actually we found two different lineages. We can't really say they are different species, but there are clearly two different genetic types of mammoths, so that came as a complete surprise to us. CHANG: The ancient DNA also gives clues to the origins of the Columbian mammoth, which lived in North and Central America. Here's Tom van der Valk again. VAN DER VALK: Could kind of show that this Columbian mammoth is a hybrid species between two of the genetic lineages. So one is the new genetic lineage that we found in this paper, and the other is the woolly mammoth genetic lineage, so to say. CHANG: Their work appears today in the journal Nature. SHAPIRO: Alfred Roca of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign wasn't involved in the work but wrote an accompanying editorial. ALFRED ROCA: It's an absolutely amazing discovery. It takes back the field of ancient DNA twice as far in geological time as before. CHANG: And that genetic puzzling unlocks the possibility, he says, that we may soon find more evolutionary play-by-plays hiding in super-old DNA. (SOUNDBITE OF LOS CAMPESINOS SONG, \"YOU! ME!

We can't really say they are different species, but there are clearly two different genetic types of mammoths, so that came as a complete surprise to us. CHANG: The ancient DNA also gives clues to the origins of the Columbian mammoth, which lived in North and Central America. Here's Tom van der Valk again. VAN DER VALK: Could kind of show that this Columbian mammoth is a hybrid species between two of the genetic lineages. So one is the new genetic lineage that we found in this paper, and the other is the woolly mammoth genetic lineage, so to say. CHANG: Their work appears today in the journal Nature. SHAPIRO: Alfred Roca of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign wasn't involved in the work but wrote an accompanying editorial. ALFRED ROCA: It's an absolutely amazing discovery. It takes back the field of ancient DNA twice as far in geological time as before. CHANG: And that genetic puzzling unlocks the possibility, he says, that we may soon find more evolutionary play-by-plays hiding in super-old DNA. (SOUNDBITE OF LOS CAMPESINOS SONG, \"YOU! ME!

Watch out, BJ Leiderman, who writes our theme music.

The big news this spearfishing season is that the state's top sturgeon biologist has been charged with crimes related to the illegal bartering of caviar (laughter) - fishy. Here's Susan Bence of member station WUWM. SUSAN BENCE, BYLINE: Just over a week before its February 13 kickoff, Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources sturgeon biologist Ryan Koenigs predicted a good spearing season. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)RYAN KOENIGS: Water clarity is actually the biggest predictor of sturgeon spearing success. With the water clarity this year being favorable. . . BENCE: Then, just before spearing fans began hauling shanties onto Lake Winnebago's frozen vastness, news broke of accusations that Koenigs had been part of a caviar racket. In Wisconsin, spearers who harvest a female sturgeon with eggs may process and share the eggs but may not barter or sell them. Koenigs is accused of handing over sturgeon eggs set aside for research to a processor. And in return, he allegedly received thousands of dollars' worth of processed caviar. JIM PATT: So we aren't too far out here. We'll be there shortly. We have six shanties out here. BENCE: Fisherman Jim Patt has known and collaborated with Koenigs over the years. Patt grew up along Lake Winnebago and first went spearfishing as a child with his dad. He drives me out to a collection of shanties off the lake's western shore, where generations of his family and friends have shared the spearing tradition. PATT: Yeah, nephews and my children, too. My daughter and my son both spear. We've all gotten fish. Sometimes you go a number of years without getting any. I have a cousin that hasn't got one since the '90s. He's out here all the time. He's just not - one doesn't swim through. BENCE: We're inside his latest homemade shanty. Three spears can comfortably peer through large holes carved through the 20-inch-thick ice. And Patt, he doesn't take the fish's abundance for granted. When he was a kid, sturgeon numbers were low due to years of overfishing and poaching, in many cases for the caviar. Sturgeon supporters around the lake stepped up to assist the DNR, forming the group Sturgeon for Tomorrow. More than four decades later, Patt is one of its 2,000-plus members, and the sturgeon population has bounced back to more than 40,000 adult fish. PATT: We do a lot for the fish - a lot of spawning habitat, a lot of research we've sponsored. It's come a long ways. And what would it be - 42, almost 43 years now? It's over a million dollars that we've donated. BENCE: Patt is baffled by Koenigs' alleged actions, having worked with the DNR scientist as an ally in conservation. And he sees the potential of having to start over with a new state biologist as a setback. PATT: We're in a good place right now, and if Ryan is not there anymore, it's going to take years to bring something back. Hopefully it won't affect the sturgeon, but we don't know that, either. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: All right, Joseph. What's your - how do you spell your last name? BENCE: Back on land, Joseph Beck and Jackson Schroeder aren't worrying about the future.

Many of us, of course, are working from home. Kids are schooling at home, clicking on computers rather than raising their hands in classrooms. And this has resulted in what's known as digital eye strain, tired and dry eyes from so much screen time. So some have turned to blue light-blocking glasses. Sales have more than doubled during the pandemic, but are they worth the cost? Dr. Mark Rosenfield is a professor at the College of Optometry at State University of New York. He conducted two studies on the effectiveness of blue light-blocking glasses on digital eye strain, and he joins us now. Welcome to the program. MARK ROSENFIELD: Thank you. GARCIA-NAVARRO: So what did your study discover about wearing these glasses? ROSENFIELD: Both of the studies actually found that the blue-blocking filters have no effect, no significant effect on digital eye strain. This didn't really come as a major surprise to us because there really is no mechanism whereby the blue light should be causing digital eye strain. GARCIA-NAVARRO: I have to say that feels like a big reveal, but I'm not surprised. It always feels like these things might just be sort of gimmicks. I mean, how did you prove that in your study? ROSENFIELD: Well, we did two studies. The first study, we used the filter that blocked almost 100% of the blue light. And we had the subjects read from a tablet computer for about 30 minutes. And we found no significant difference in symptoms, whether they were using the blue-blocking filter or they were just using a tinted lens, in effect. Now, because that filter blocked almost 100% of the blue light, and very few commercially available lenses actually do that, we redid the study. But this time, we used commercially available spectacle lenses that typically only block around 20 to 25% of the blue. And the second study was done on a double-blind basis, which meant that the subjects didn't know whether they were looking through the blue-blocking filters or just a clear lens. And the experimenter also didn't know which lens that the subjects were looking through. And again, we found exactly the same effect - that the blue-blocking filters produced no significant change in symptoms of digital eye strain. GARCIA-NAVARRO: So what is the cause of digital eye strain? ROSENFIELD: We think - it's not so much the screens themselves but rather the way people use them. They tend to hold them at pretty close distances, especially smartphones. We found that people were holding them sometimes as close as 8, 9 inches away, whereas printed material is typically held around 16 inches away. And also people tend to look at these screens for very long periods of time without taking breaks. GARCIA-NAVARRO: So these glasses - are they good for anything at all? ROSENFIELD: The only thing they may be good for is that studies have shown the blue light can interfere with our bodies' light cycle. So we all have natural rhythm so that we know when we get tired, when it's time to go to bed. If you want to look at your screen late at night, which probably isn't a good idea - but unfortunately many of us still do, then the blue-blocking filters might be useful in that regard. GARCIA-NAVARRO: So what can we do to sort of minimize digital eye strain, since so many of us are needing to be in front of a screen at this time? ROSENFIELD: Well, taking breaks, I think, is very important. We talk about the 20, 20, 20 rule, where every 20 minutes it's a good idea to look at something at least 20 feet for at least 20 seconds. Try and increase the viewing distance, especially with a handheld device like a phone or a tablet. Don't hold it so close because the closer you hold something, the harder the eyes have to work to focus. So we recommend the device should never be less than 16 inches away. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Dr. Mark Rosenfield is a vision researcher at State University of New York. Thank you so much. ROSENFIELD: My pleasure. Thank you.

Climate change concerns are pushing the auto industry toward electric. And now, there's a similar push around buildings, another big source of heat-trapping gases. Natural gas utilities worry that electrifying homes and offices may jeopardize the gas industry's future. NPR's Jeff Brady has the first part of an investigation into how the industry is fighting back. JEFF BRADY, BYLINE: In recent years, natural gas got a bit of a halo. It helped reduce carbon emissions as gas-fired power plants replaced dirtier coal ones. But that's no longer good enough as more cities, businesses and now the Biden administration seek to completely zero out greenhouse gas emissions, including from buildings. KAREN HARBERT: If the goal is to reduce emissions, we're all in. If the goal is to put us out of business, not so much. BRADY: Karen Harbert heads the American Gas Association, the main trade group for gas utilities that serve tens of millions of homes and businesses. These days, her members spend a lot of time touting the cleaner alternatives they're developing - so-called renewable natural gas and hydrogen. But to avoid the worst effects of climate change, scientists say quicker action is needed. Most researchers, like Erin Mayfield at Princeton University, have concluded that switching away from gas to electricity is the most efficient way to eliminate carbon emissions from most buildings by 2050. ERIN MAYFIELD: We cannot continue using natural gas for things like heating and cooking because it's not consistent with reaching a net-zero goal. BRADY: President Biden's ambitious climate plan includes incentives to switch from gas to electric furnaces and appliances. That was a concern at an industry conference just after the November election. NPR obtained a recording. AGA Vice President Sue Forrester said the plan would mean nothing less than eliminating natural gas. SUE FORRESTER: Our goal is to reframe the debate around natural gas and to really show value proposition of natural gas and our energy infrastructure and how we're going to be key to a clean energy future. BRADY: Even before Biden was elected, the industry saw the electrification push coming. It doubled down on its Cooking With Gas campaign that included young social media influencers. (SOUNDBITE OF INSTAGRAM VIDEO)AMBER KELLEY: Hey, guys. I'm Amber Kelley from Cook With Amber. The first thing we got to do is heat up our pan, so I'm going to turn our stove on. BRADY: Some of the industry's other efforts are more aggressive, but less public. It's lobbying to pass state laws barring local governments from restricting gas use in new buildings. This after more than 40 California communities banned new gas hookups or restricted gas use in order to meet their climate goals. NPR reviewed internal AGA documents obtained through public records request by the Climate Investigation Center. They show that these state laws became a priority for the gas association at least as far back as December 2019. So far, four states have passed the so-called preemption bills, and 11 more mostly Republican-led states are considering them. Again, Karen Harbert. HARBERT: We are not coordinating these efforts, and we are not state lobbyists. We concentrate our activities certainly at the federal level. BRADY: The distinction is important. Much of AGA's budget comes from ratepayers through its member utilities. That means you, as a ratepayer, could be funding this work even if you don't agree with it. In California, the country's largest gas utility, SoCal Gas, faces possible fines for allegedly using ratepayer money to oppose municipal electrification efforts, allegations the company denies. It's clear from internal communication that the AGA is at least serving as a clearinghouse for the utilities and local gas associations promoting preemption bills around the country. Robert Brulle is a visiting professor at Brown University who researches campaigns like this. ROBERT BRULLE: There are textbooks on this. And this is a textbook example of this kind of information and influence campaigning operation. BRADY: That campaign is framed in customer choice terms - that people should be able to choose what kind of energy they use in their homes. Brulle says the risk is that it will help stall climate action further, favoring one vested interest over the collective good. Jeff Brady, NPR News.

KAREN HARBERT: If the goal is to reduce emissions, we're all in. If the goal is to put us out of business, not so much. BRADY: Karen Harbert heads the American Gas Association, the main trade group for gas utilities that serve tens of millions of homes and businesses. These days, her members spend a lot of time touting the cleaner alternatives they're developing - so-called renewable natural gas and hydrogen. But to avoid the worst effects of climate change, scientists say quicker action is needed. Most researchers, like Erin Mayfield at Princeton University, have concluded that switching away from gas to electricity is the most efficient way to eliminate carbon emissions from most buildings by 2050. ERIN MAYFIELD: We cannot continue using natural gas for things like heating and cooking because it's not consistent with reaching a net-zero goal. BRADY: President Biden's ambitious climate plan includes incentives to switch from gas to electric furnaces and appliances. That was a concern at an industry conference just after the November election. NPR obtained a recording. AGA Vice President Sue Forrester said the plan would mean nothing less than eliminating natural gas. SUE FORRESTER: Our goal is to reframe the debate around natural gas and to really show value proposition of natural gas and our energy infrastructure and how we're going to be key to a clean energy future. BRADY: Even before Biden was elected, the industry saw the electrification push coming. It doubled down on its Cooking With Gas campaign that included young social media influencers. (SOUNDBITE OF INSTAGRAM VIDEO) AMBER KELLEY: Hey, guys. I'm Amber Kelley from Cook With Amber. The first thing we got to do is heat up our pan, so I'm going to turn our stove on. BRADY: Some of the industry's other efforts are more aggressive, but less public. It's lobbying to pass state laws barring local governments from restricting gas use in new buildings. This after more than 40 California communities banned new gas hookups or restricted gas use in order to meet their climate goals. NPR reviewed internal AGA documents obtained through public records request by the Climate Investigation Center. They show that these state laws became a priority for the gas association at least as far back as December 2019. So far, four states have passed the so-called preemption bills, and 11 more mostly Republican-led states are considering them. Again, Karen Harbert. HARBERT: We are not coordinating these efforts, and we are not state lobbyists. We concentrate our activities certainly at the federal level. BRADY: The distinction is important. Much of AGA's budget comes from ratepayers through its member utilities. That means you, as a ratepayer, could be funding this work even if you don't agree with it. In California, the country's largest gas utility, SoCal Gas, faces possible fines for allegedly using ratepayer money to oppose municipal electrification efforts, allegations the company denies. It's clear from internal communication that the AGA is at least serving as a clearinghouse for the utilities and local gas associations promoting preemption bills around the country. Robert Brulle is a visiting professor at Brown University who researches campaigns like this. ROBERT BRULLE: There are textbooks on this. And this is a textbook example of this kind of information and influence campaigning operation. BRADY: That campaign is framed in customer choice terms - that people should be able to choose what kind of energy they use in their homes. Brulle says the risk is that it will help stall climate action further, favoring one vested interest over the collective good.

Climate change is driving a lot of that flooding, and poorer people stand to lose the most. NPR's Rebecca Hersher reports. REBECCA HERSHER, BYLINE: Pastor Aaron Trigg cannot say enough good things about Rainelle, W. V. , where he used to live. AARON TRIGG: People were just happy and joyous and had a lot of expectation for the future. HERSHER: Rainelle is small. About 1,500 people live there. It's got a school and a grocery store and a couple stoplights. And it's in a steep valley with a creek running through it. In the summer of 2016, there was a lot of rain, and the creek started rising. TRIGG: And you could hear the water up in the mountains crashing trees. And next thing you know, it was at our waist. HERSHER: It was evening. Trigg's house was already underwater, so he took shelter on the second floor of his neighbor's house. TRIGG: But you could hear people screaming and hollering for help. It was a real restless night, a real - just no peace at all. I did a lot of praying that night. HERSHER: Trigg was rescued by boat in the morning. In all, at least 23 people in West Virginia died in the floods. More than a thousand homes were destroyed. Rainelle was decimated. It's one of hundreds of small towns across the country where climate-driven flooding is an existential threat. New data from the First Street Foundation, a climate risk nonprofit, shows that more than 4 million homes are at risk for expensive flood damage. They're concentrated on the coasts and in Appalachia, although there are hot spots across the country. And the homeowners who will be hit the hardest are those who can't afford flood insurance. Matthew Eby is the executive director of the First Street Foundation. MATTHEW EBY: In America, flood insurance for the vast majority of the population is provided through FEMA's National Flood Insurance Program. HERSHER: And that flood insurance doesn't cost the right amount - that's according to FEMA. Every month, homeowners who have flood insurance pay a monthly premium. But those monthly premiums don't even come close to covering the actual cost of flood damage from most houses. The government always has to pick up the tab, which is why the National Flood Insurance Program has racked up more than $36 billion in debt, and it's one reason that developers keep building homes in dangerous places. To help fix all of that, FEMA is going to start raising the price of flood insurance later this year. But to actually keep up with the cost of climate change, the new data suggests that flood insurance rates would need to more than quadruple in the next 30 years, which would put flood insurance out of reach for many, if not most, families. EBY: So there'll be a ton of properties without policies that are just waiting for that unfortunate event to happen. And then we're going to see a lot of actual economic pain because they won't have the ability to then fix the home. HERSHER: FEMA says the group's analysis is, quote, \"premature\" because FEMA hasn't released the full details of its new pricing scheme. But what research makes clear is that when large numbers of people don't have insurance or savings after a disaster, the effects can ripple through a community. That's exactly what happened in Rainelle after the 2016 flood. Pastor Aaron Trigg was getting calls late at night from his congregants. TRIGG: The way I could say it is they were hopeless because they - a lot of people in Rainelle were poor, and they didn't have insurance. They didn't have any way to have any backup plan. HERSHER: He says a lot of people left town. Trigg stuck around for a few years before he, too, moved away for a new job. A lot of homes were never rebuilt. Today, entire blocks of Main Street are empty of businesses. John Wyatt is a city councilman and a pastor and a musician, flood survivor and the owner of a music store in Rainelle. He's also running for mayor. And like any good mayoral candidate, he's a booster for his town. JOHN WYATT: We're a bona fide Appalachian community, and we have a lot to offer. HERSHER: For example, he'd like to see Rainelle host an Appalachian music festival. There are some barriers. The only motel in town has been closed since the flood nearly five years ago.

DAN CHARLES, BYLINE: If you fly over the Midwest in spring and look down at the bare ground, you can see slight differences in color. There's a lot of dark earth, what people call topsoil. Scientists like Evan Thaler, a PhD student at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, call it the A horizon. EVAN THALER: Black, organic rich soil that's really good for growing crops. CHARLES: And it's a storehouse of carbon in the form of living microorganisms and decaying plant roots. When settlers first arrived in the Midwest, it was everywhere. THALER: And the roots in the prairie go down, you know, six to eight feet sometimes, creating this really deep, dark soils. CHARLES: But plowing destroyed a lot of it, releasing huge amounts of carbon dioxide, contributing to climate change. Erosion also carried it away. And now you'll also see areas that are a different color - light brown. Thaler started comparing that color as seen from satellites with direct soil measurements, and he found that the light brown soil had so little organic material, you really couldn't call it A horizon soil. That topsoil layer was gone consistently on particular parts of the landscape. THALER: The A horizon is almost always gone on hilltops. CHARLES: Thaler says most of it just gradually fell down the hillsides as farmers tilled the soil year after year. So he estimated topsoil loss across much of the upper Midwest based on how much crop land is located on these erosion-prone hills and just published the result in the journal PNAS. He says a third of all the cropland in this whole area has completely lost its layer of topsoil. That's way more than official estimates from the Department of Agriculture. THALER: I think the USDA is dramatically underestimating the amount of loss. CHARLES: Some soil scientists in the Midwest are not convinced. This method, they say, relies on a lot of assumptions. But they agree that soil loss is a big problem; Anna Cates, for instance, who's Minnesota's state soil health specialist. ANNA CATES: To me, it's not important whether it's exactly a third. Maybe it's 20%, maybe it's 40%. There's a lot of topsoil gone from the hills.

MICHAELEEN DOUCLEFF, BYLINE: I'm trained as a scientist. I spent seven years as a chemist. And I really believed that the parenting advice we got today was backed by, you know, really stringent scientific research. And when I started looking at the studies as a scientist, I was really, really let down. MARTIN: Let down because she couldn't find answers to the problems she was having with her toddler, Rosy. DOUCLEFF: She started actually, like, slapping me across the face, like, regularly. And I read all this stuff and nothing seemed to work. In fact, a lot of it made things worse for us. And then I started doing a story actually for NPR on parenting in the Yucatan. And, oh, my gosh, Rachel, it just, like, shifted my whole sense of what parenting could be and what mothering was. MARTIN: So she decided to visit again, this time taking her daughter with her to the Yucatan, then the Arctic and Tanzania. She writes about what they experienced and how to be a better parent in her new book, \"Hunt, Gather, Parent. \"DOUCLEFF: I really wanted to see how other parents handled her. So when I went to the Yucatan, the moms that I watched - I interviewed a bunch of moms and watched them with their kids and they just had this incredibly calm, relaxed confidence about them that I had never seen in my life in San Francisco and growing up. And, you know, there was no yelling or bickering or nagging and yet the kids were very kind and respectful and super helpful. And I just wondered, like, what would they do with Rosy? MARTIN: There's a great story that you tell in the book about landing in this Arctic village and navigating your way through the main street with Rosy in the middle of, like, a total meltdown. DOUCLEFF: Yeah. It was embarrassing, to be completely honest with you, because she was really the only kid that was acting that way. MARTIN: What is so different about, for example, parenting in this Arctic village? DOUCLEFF: One of the key, key differences is that the parents never engage with the child at, like, a heated level, at, like, the child's level. So all the parents have this incredible calm energy that they bring to every interaction with a child. So no matter how heated the child is and upset the child is, the parent remains this incredibly calm, gentle way. MARTIN: Michaeleen, how is this possible? I mean, in all seriousness, this can't just be everyone, right? Like, there must be some parents in these places that lose their temper. DOUCLEFF: OK, sure. Of course. Of course. You know, I mean, I spent about, I say, seven or eight weeks, you know, in these places total. And I saw one mom lose her temper (laughter) you know. MARTIN: Wow. DOUCLEFF: And she was a very young mom, too, you know. . . MARTIN: Not as much experience as the other families you spent time with. How do they keep it together? DOUCLEFF: So I think a big part of it - and I talk a lot about this in the book - is they have a different perception of children and their behavior. So it's not so much that they're suppressing anger towards children or suppressing frustration. It's that they look at children in a way that allows them to have less or really no anger towards children. So, for instance, you know, we often think that children are pushing our buttons or testing boundaries or manipulating us. But they actually - a lot of parents don't see children that way. They see them as just really inept, illogical beings that are, of course, misbehaving because they haven't learned yet. MARTIN: In the Yucatan, you observed this family where not only did parents not yell at kids, but the children just did chores. They just did them magically. No one asked them to do them. They just saw what needed to be done and then did those things. DOUCLEFF: So we actually saw this on our first trip down there. It was - the girls were on spring break. The family has three girls. And we were actually getting ready to leave the house. And the 12-year-old woke up on her spring break and just started doing the dishes. Like, nobody asked her or anything. And the mom was not even surprised. She was like, well, you know, she's 12, so she knows what needs to be done if she sees it. And I was just kind of like, what? MARTIN: Like, obviously, right. (LAUGHTER)DOUCLEFF: And actually, you know, if you look around the world, Rachel, like, this is not super uncommon and that in many ways, like, our kids, that, you know, don't want to do anything or we have to, like, really force them to do things, is more the exception. So in the book, you learn about all these things that parents can do to nurture this quality in children and all the things parents can do to, like, erode this quality. MARTIN: OK, so you developed a framework to think about all of this in form of an acronym - TEAM, T-E-A-M. Can you just briefly summarize what each of those letters stands for? DOUCLEFF: Yeah. So I came up with this to help me remember it with my daughter. So T is togetherness, and this means doing chores and activities together. So then E, which I think is the hardest one by far, is encouraging versus forcing. So A is autonomy. What it is it's - yes, it's right to self-governance to make your own decisions, but you're also constantly connected to the group, and you're responsible to the group. So you're wanting to help, you are required to be respectful and you're required to share with the group. And then finally M is minimal interference. So the idea behind this - it kind of fits with autonomy, but it's like, this is not free-range parenting because the parent is always kind of there or some caretaker, you know, an older sibling, a neighbor, a friend, a relative. But they're not interfering with the child's exploration. There's this idea that the child knows what they're doing, but I'm there in case they want to engage with me or they need help. MARTIN: How has your relationship with Rosy changed through all this, Michaeleen? DOUCLEFF: Oh, my God, Rachel, I can't even like - it sounds almost too good. It's just - it's transformed incredibly. Like I say, like, at the beginning of this, I really - I dreaded my time with her. And it sounds like a horrible mom, but, you know, I was just so on edge and I didn't - I felt so much like I didn't know what to do. And now I love being with her. I think so much of our relationship was built on tension and conflict before because I was, like, trying to control her and she was trying to control me back. And at least that's how I felt. And this approach is really about minimizing conflict and tension and really maximizing cooperation. MARTIN: The book is called \"Hunt, Gather, Parent: What Ancient Cultures Can Teach Us About The Lost Art Of Raising Happy, Helpful Little Humans. \" NPR's Michaeleen Doucleff has written this book. And we so appreciate you talking to us, Michaeleen. Thank you. DOUCLEFF: Oh, Rachel, thank you so, so much.

DOUCLEFF: So I think a big part of it - and I talk a lot about this in the book - is they have a different perception of children and their behavior. So it's not so much that they're suppressing anger towards children or suppressing frustration. It's that they look at children in a way that allows them to have less or really no anger towards children. So, for instance, you know, we often think that children are pushing our buttons or testing boundaries or manipulating us. But they actually - a lot of parents don't see children that way. They see them as just really inept, illogical beings that are, of course, misbehaving because they haven't learned yet. MARTIN: In the Yucatan, you observed this family where not only did parents not yell at kids, but the children just did chores. They just did them magically. No one asked them to do them. They just saw what needed to be done and then did those things. DOUCLEFF: So we actually saw this on our first trip down there. It was - the girls were on spring break. The family has three girls. And we were actually getting ready to leave the house. And the 12-year-old woke up on her spring break and just started doing the dishes. Like, nobody asked her or anything. And the mom was not even surprised. She was like, well, you know, she's 12, so she knows what needs to be done if she sees it. And I was just kind of like, what? MARTIN: Like, obviously, right. (LAUGHTER) DOUCLEFF: And actually, you know, if you look around the world, Rachel, like, this is not super uncommon and that in many ways, like, our kids, that, you know, don't want to do anything or we have to, like, really force them to do things, is more the exception. So in the book, you learn about all these things that parents can do to nurture this quality in children and all the things parents can do to, like, erode this quality. MARTIN: OK, so you developed a framework to think about all of this in form of an acronym - TEAM, T-E-A-M. Can you just briefly summarize what each of those letters stands for? DOUCLEFF: Yeah. So I came up with this to help me remember it with my daughter. So T is togetherness, and this means doing chores and activities together. So then E, which I think is the hardest one by far, is encouraging versus forcing. So A is autonomy. What it is it's - yes, it's right to self-governance to make your own decisions, but you're also constantly connected to the group, and you're responsible to the group. So you're wanting to help, you are required to be respectful and you're required to share with the group. And then finally M is minimal interference. So the idea behind this - it kind of fits with autonomy, but it's like, this is not free-range parenting because the parent is always kind of there or some caretaker, you know, an older sibling, a neighbor, a friend, a relative. But they're not interfering with the child's exploration. There's this idea that the child knows what they're doing, but I'm there in case they want to engage with me or they need help. MARTIN: How has your relationship with Rosy changed through all this, Michaeleen? DOUCLEFF: Oh, my God, Rachel, I can't even like - it sounds almost too good. It's just - it's transformed incredibly. Like I say, like, at the beginning of this, I really - I dreaded my time with her. And it sounds like a horrible mom, but, you know, I was just so on edge and I didn't - I felt so much like I didn't know what to do. And now I love being with her. I think so much of our relationship was built on tension and conflict before because I was, like, trying to control her and she was trying to control me back. And at least that's how I felt. And this approach is really about minimizing conflict and tension and really maximizing cooperation. MARTIN: The book is called \"Hunt, Gather, Parent: What Ancient Cultures Can Teach Us About The Lost Art Of Raising Happy, Helpful Little Humans. \" NPR's Michaeleen Doucleff has written this book. And we so appreciate you talking to us, Michaeleen. Thank you. DOUCLEFF: Oh, Rachel, thank you so, so much.

I'm Manoush Zomorodi. In this hour, we have been honoring Black History Month with some of our favorite interviews from the past year, conversations about history and climate justice. And this next speaker is from our show about deception and misinformation, explaining how data and algorithms can warp our reality and discriminate, too. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)JOY BUOLAMWINI: We can deceive ourselves into thinking they're not doing harm, or we can fool ourselves into thinking, because it's based on numbers, that it is somehow neutral. AI is creeping into our lives. And even though the promise is that is going to be more efficient - it's going to be better - if what's happening is we're automating inequality through weapons of math destruction and we have algorithms of oppression, this promise is not actually true and certainly not true for everybody. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ZOMORODI: Weapons of math destruction, algorithms of oppression, which basically means bias and human error can be encoded into algorithms leading to inequality. To keep them in check, the Algorithmic Justice League to the rescue. BUOLAMWINI: My name is Joy Buolamwini. I'm the founder of the Algorithmic Justice League, where we use research and art to create a world with more equitable and accountable AI. You might have heard of the male gaze or the white gaze or the post-colonial gaze. To that lexicon, I add the coded gaze. And we want to make sure people are even aware of it because you can't fight the power you don't see, you don't know about. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ZOMORODI: Joy hunts down the flaws in the technology that's running every part of our lives, from deciding what we see on Instagram to how we might be sentenced for a crime. BUOLAMWINI: What happens when somebody is harmed by a system you created? You know, what happens if you're harmed? Where do you go? And we want that kind of place to be the Algorithmic Justice League, so you can seek redress for algorithmic harms. ZOMORODI: You are a lot of things. You're a poet. You're a computer scientist. You are a superhero. Like. . . (LAUGHTER)ZOMORODI: Kind of hard to put into a box. Can you just explain why you created the Algorithmic Justice League? BUOLAMWINI: Yes. So the Algorithmic Justice League is a bit of an accident. When I was in graduate school, I was working on an art project that used some computer vision technology to track my face. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BUOLAMWINI: Hi, camera. I've got a face. Can you see my face? So at least that was the idea. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BUOLAMWINI: You can see her face. What about my face? And when I'd try to get it to work on my face, I found that putting a white mask on my dark skin. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BUOLAMWINI: Well, I've got a mask. . . . Is what I needed in order to have the system pick me up. And so that led to questions about, wait - are machines neutral? Why do I need to change myself to be seen by a machine? And if this is using AI techniques that are being used in other areas of our lives - whether it's health or education, transportation, the criminal justice system - what does it mean if different kinds of mistakes are being made? And also, even if these systems do work well - let's say you are able to track a face perfectly - what does that mean for surveillance? What does it mean for democracy, First Amendment rights, you know? ZOMORODI: Joy continues from the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)BUOLAMWINI: Across the U. S. , police departments are starting to use facial recognition software in their crime-fighting arsenal. Georgetown Law published a report showing that 1 in 2 adults in the U. S. - that's 117 million people - have their faces in facial recognition networks. Police departments can currently look at these networks unregulated, using algorithms that have not been audited for accuracy. Machine learning is being used for facial recognition, but it's also extending beyond the realm of computer vision. So who gets hired or fired? Do you get that loan? Do you get insurance? Are you admitted into the college that you wanted to get into? Do you and I pay the same price for the same product purchased on the same platform? Law enforcement is also starting to use machine learning for predictive policing. Some judges use machine-generated risk scores to determine how long an individual is going to spend in prison. So we really have to think about these decisions. Are they fair? And we've seen that algorithmic bias doesn't necessarily always lead to fair outcomes. When I think about algorithmic bias - and people ask me, well, what do you mean machines (laughter) are biased? It's just numbers. It's just data. I talk about machine learning. And it's a question of, well, what is the machine learning from? ZOMORODI: Well, what is the machine learning from? Like, what's the information that it's taking in? BUOLAMWINI: So an example of this - what I found was that for face detection, the ways in which systems were being trained involve collecting large data sets of images of human faces. And when you look at those data sets, I found that many of them were pale and male, right? You might have a dataset that's 75% male faces over 80% lighter-skin faces. And so what it means is the machine is learning a representation of the world that is skewed. And so what you might have thought should be a neutral process is actually reflecting the biases that it has been trained on. And sometimes what you're seeing is a skewed representation, but other times what machines are picking up on are our own societal biases that are actually treated as data. ZOMORODI: For example, Amazon was building a hiring tool. BUOLAMWINI: You need a job. Somebody in your life needs a job, right? You want to get hired. ZOMORODI: And to get hired, you upload your resume and your cover letter. BUOLAMWINI: That's the goal. It starts off well. ZOMORODI: But before a human looks at your resume, it gets vetted by algorithms written by software engineers. BUOLAMWINI: So we start off with an intent for efficiency. We have many more applications than any human could go through. Let's create a system that can do it more efficiently than we can. ZOMORODI: And how to build that better system? BUOLAMWINI: Well, we're going to gather data of resumes, and we're going to sort those resumes by the ones that represented candidates we hired or did well. Your target is who you think will be a good long-term employee. ZOMORODI: And now the system gets trained on the data. BUOLAMWINI: And the system is learning from prior data. So I like to say the past dwells within our algorithms. You don't have to have the sexist hiring manager in front of you. Now you have a black box that's serving as the gatekeeper. But what it's learning are the patterns of what success has looked like in the past. So if we're defining success by how it's looked like in the past and the past has been one where men were given opportunity, white people were given opportunity and you don't necessarily fit that profile, even though you might think you're creating this objective system, it's going through resumes - right? - this is where we run into problems. ZOMORODI: So here's what happened with Amazon's hiring tool. BUOLAMWINI: What happened was, as the model was being built and it was being tested, what they found was a gender bias where resumes that contained the word women or women's or even all-women's colleges - right? - so indication of being a woman were categorically being ranked lower than those that didn't. And try as they might, they were not able to remove that gender bias, so they ended up scratching the system. (SOUNDBITE OF RECORD SCRATCHING)ZOMORODI: They scratched the system, and that's a big win. But one win compared to thousands of platforms that use skewed algorithms - that could warp reality. BUOLAMWINI: It has not been the case that we've had universal equality or absolute equality, in the words of Frederick Douglass. And I especially worry about this when we think about techno benevolence in the space of health care, right? We're looking at, let's say, a breakthrough that comes in talking about skin cancer. Oh, we now have an AI system - right? - that can classify skin cancer as well as the top dermatologists, a study might say, a headline might read. And then when you look at it, it's like, oh, well, actually, when you look at the dataset, it was for lighter-skinned individuals. And then you might argue, well, you know, lighter-skinned people are more likely to get skin cancer. And when I was looking into this, it actually - darker-skinned people who get skin cancer, usually it's detected in stage 4 because there are all of these assumptions you're not even going to get it. . . ZOMORODI: Ah. BUOLAMWINI: . . . In the first place. So these assumptions can have meaningful consequences. ZOMORODI: Have you seen any examples of artificial intelligence being used in voting or politics? BUOLAMWINI: Yeah. So Channel 4 News just did this massive investigation showing that the 2016 Trump campaign targeted 3. 5 million African Americans in the United States, labeled them as deterrents in an attempt to actually keep people from showing up to the polls. ZOMORODI: They used targeted ads. BUOLAMWINI: Yes. And we know from Facebook's own research - right? - that you can influence voter turnout based on the kinds of posts that are put on their platform. And they did this in battleground states. And so in this way, we're seeing predictive modeling and ad targeting - right? - being used as a tool of voter suppression, which has always been the case to disenfranchise, right? You might say Black lives don't matter, but it's clear Black votes matter because of. . . ZOMORODI: Right. BUOLAMWINI: . . . So much effort used to rob people of what blood was spilt for, you know, for generations. So it should be the case - right? - that any sorts of algorithmic tools that are intended to be used, again, have to be verified for nondiscrimination before it's even adopted. ZOMORODI: So as a Black woman technologist, you know, there are not that many of you, frankly. Why not, you know, go work at Google or Amazon and make these changes to the algorithms directly? Why act as sort of a watchdog? BUOLAMWINI: Well, I think there are multiple ways to be involved in the ecosystem. But I do think this question you pose is really important because it can be an assumption that by changing who's in the room, which is important and needs to happen, we're going to then change the outcome and the outputs of these systems. So I like to remind people that most software developers, engineers, computer scientists - you don't build everything from scratch, right? You get reusable parts. And so if there's bias within those reusable parts or large-scale bias in the data sets that have become standard practice or the status quo - right? - changing the people who are involved in the system without changing the system itself is still going to reproduce algorithmic bias and algorithmic harms. ZOMORODI: So how do we build systems that are more fair? Like, if there's no data for the artificial intelligence to sort of, you know, process to start to pump out recommendations, then how do we even change that? BUOLAMWINI: Yeah. Well, it's a question of what tools do you use towards what objectives. So the first thing is seeing if this is the appropriate tool. Not every tool, not every decision, needs to be run through AI. And oftentimes, you also need to make sure you're being intentional. And so the kinds. . . ZOMORODI: Right. BUOLAMWINI: . . . Of changes you would need to make systematically for even who gets into the job pool in general - it means you do have to change society to change what AI is learning. ZOMORODI: What do you say, Joy, to people who might be listening and thinking, like, you know, let's take a step back and look at the bigger picture. We - in many ways, things are way better than they were thanks to technology because, you know, here we are in a pandemic, and anyone can work from anywhere because we have the Internet and we have Zoom and all of these platforms. Equality and access is on the whole improved. Why - let's not, like, be Debbie Downers about it. BUOLAMWINI: Yeah. I mean, I always ask who can afford to say that? Because I can tell you, the kids who are sitting in McDonald's parking lot so they can access the Internet to be able to attend school remotely, that has never been their reality. And so oftentimes, if you are able to say technology on the whole has done well, it probably means you're in a fairly privileged position. There's still a huge digital divide. Even - there are billions of people who don't have access to the Internet. I mean, I was born in Canada, moved to Ghana and then grew up in the U. S. I had very Western assumptions, you know, about what tech could do and very much excited to use the tech skills I gained as a undergrad at Georgia Tech, you know, to use tech for good, tech for the benefit of humanity. And so when I critique tech, it's really coming from a place of having been enamored with it and wanting it to live up to its promises. I don't think it's being a Debbie Downer to show ways in which we can improve so the promise of something we've created can actually be realized. I think that's even a more optimistic approach than to believe in a wishful thinking that is not true. ZOMORODI: You know, one thing that you've said that I find so - I love this idea - that you say there's a difference between potential and reality and that we must separate those two ideas. BUOLAMWINI: Yes. So it's so easy to fixate on our aspirations of what tech could be. And I think in some ways, it's this hope that we can transcend our own humanity - right? - our own failures. And so, yes, even if we haven't gotten society quite right, ideally, we can build technology that's better than we are. But we then have to look at that fact that technology reflects who we are. It doesn't transcend who we are. And so I think it's important that when we think about technology, we ask, what's the promise? What's the reality? And not only what's that gap, but who does it work for? Who does it benefit? Who does it harm and why? And also, how do we then step up and stand up to those harms?

Equality and access is on the whole improved. Why - let's not, like, be Debbie Downers about it. BUOLAMWINI: Yeah. I mean, I always ask who can afford to say that? Because I can tell you, the kids who are sitting in McDonald's parking lot so they can access the Internet to be able to attend school remotely, that has never been their reality. And so oftentimes, if you are able to say technology on the whole has done well, it probably means you're in a fairly privileged position. There's still a huge digital divide. Even - there are billions of people who don't have access to the Internet. I mean, I was born in Canada, moved to Ghana and then grew up in the U. S. I had very Western assumptions, you know, about what tech could do and very much excited to use the tech skills I gained as a undergrad at Georgia Tech, you know, to use tech for good, tech for the benefit of humanity. And so when I critique tech, it's really coming from a place of having been enamored with it and wanting it to live up to its promises. I don't think it's being a Debbie Downer to show ways in which we can improve so the promise of something we've created can actually be realized. I think that's even a more optimistic approach than to believe in a wishful thinking that is not true. ZOMORODI: You know, one thing that you've said that I find so - I love this idea - that you say there's a difference between potential and reality and that we must separate those two ideas. BUOLAMWINI: Yes. So it's so easy to fixate on our aspirations of what tech could be. And I think in some ways, it's this hope that we can transcend our own humanity - right? - our own failures. And so, yes, even if we haven't gotten society quite right, ideally, we can build technology that's better than we are. But we then have to look at that fact that technology reflects who we are. It doesn't transcend who we are. And so I think it's important that when we think about technology, we ask, what's the promise? What's the reality? And not only what's that gap, but who does it work for? Who does it benefit? Who does it harm and why? And also, how do we then step up and stand up to those harms?

And for some people, that relationship is with the water they drink. But for others, it's the water that surrounds them. COLETTE PICHON BATTLE: The bayou is green and lush and all of the things that equal bountiful life. But it is also watery and muddy. You can smell everything. You can smell when something has died. You can smell when something is newly bloomed. The swamp is very noisy. It's never quiet - full of everything, but if you had to live there your whole life, you would have everything you needed. ZOMORODI: This is Colette Pichon Battle. She was born and raised in southern Louisiana and grew up in the middle of all of those smells and sounds. PICHON BATTLE: Yeah. I grew up in Bayou Liberty, just north of New Orleans, in the bayou. I lived in the house where my mother was born, that my grandfather built. I lived on the land that has been in my family for generations, even before it was America. ZOMORODI: Collette is an attorney. She practiced law for years, but these days, she's taken on another role. PICHON BATTLE: I'm a climate activist now. Not a title I would have given myself, not a title I would have preferred, but I'll take it - whatever works. ZOMORODI: She'll take it because she feels like she doesn't have a choice. Rising sea levels and stronger storms are constantly threatening the land that Colette's family has lived on for generations. PICHON BATTLE: I work at the community level to make sure that Black folks and poor folks and Native folks are part of this climate movement. ZOMORODI: For Colette, that means bringing her neighbors into the policy conversations, sharing the science around global warming and making sure that they contribute their knowledge, too, because this community understands the ebb and flow of the water better than anyone. PICHON BATTLE: Our livelihood and our life was absolutely with water every day. And in the spring, which most folks understand as hurricane season - that is where you really had to start paying attention. So you would hear people talking about how much rain they got, how far did the flooding go up. But it wasn't a panic. It was more informational. And I can remember as a child during hurricanes, the hurricane has, like, three portions to it. It's the sort of outer wall, the eye and then the next wall. And as a kid, when the eye would pass - so that was always when you would have several hours of open, clear sky, clear air, and you could go check on things. And I remember it being so much fun to go out in the eye of the storm to go check on folks. Isn't that crazy? ZOMORODI: Wow. Yes. PICHON BATTLE: You would get in a - we'd call them Pirogue - in a flat-bottomed boat. You'd get in a Pirogue, go down the street, make sure folks were OK. ZOMORODI: Wow. PICHON BATTLE: It was just enough time to go make sure no one had a tree in their roof or needed help. And then you would go back in, and you would wait for that other band to go across. And it wasn't a terrible existence. It was just one where you had to have traditional knowledge coupled with your reality in order to survive. ZOMORODI: Nature was somewhat predictable. But all that changed in 2005, when those weather patterns shifted. PICHON BATTLE: The real moment of noticing that change was Katrina. ZOMORODI: The water became unrecognizable as the storm ripped through and then scattered Colette's community. PICHON BATTLE: I mean, they were all over. And we finally just got a number to folks to call in at one time. We got to hear what was going on or what had happened or what folks had left. And we start with our VA, with our old people. And the first words out of their mouths were, the water has never been this high. And that is when I started learning about the loss of our barrier islands due to oil and gas drilling. ZOMORODI: Wow. PICHON BATTLE: And so the things that protected us weren't there anymore. And the sea level is higher. And so the drastic and dramatic changes was noticeable and evident to everyone. ZOMORODI: And at the time, you weren't home, right? You had left Louisiana. You were practicing law in D. C. , but then you dropped everything and changed your career. PICHON BATTLE: It was a crack in the universe to come home and see the destruction of Katrina. And it was in that moment that I said I was never leaving home again. You see that kind of destruction, and your life will change whether you want it to or not. That was my moment of career change. I was going to have to take a much different advocacy role - not standing in front of a court, pointing to particular pieces of law, but instead standing in front of my community and convince them of what I knew deep in my heart, which was that climate change was going to come after all of us and that it was going to take what we love the most, which is where we're from. ZOMORODI: A couple years after Katrina, Colette and her community realized that hurricanes of this magnitude were here to stay. And that might mean that they needed to go. She picks up the story from the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)PICHON BATTLE: It was about two years after Hurricane Katrina that I first saw the Louisiana flood maps. These flood maps are used to show land loss in the past and land loss that is to come. On this particular day, at a community meeting, I volunteered to interact with the graphics on the wall, and in an instant my life changed for the second time in two years. The graphics showed massive land loss, but more specifically, the graphics showed the disappearance of my community and many other communities before the end of the century. I was standing there with other members of south Louisiana's communities - Black, Native, poor. We thought we were just bound by temporary disaster recovery, but we found that we were now bound by the impossible task of ensuring that our communities would not be erased due to climate change. I just assumed it would always be there - land, trees, bayous. I just assumed that it would be there as it had been for thousands of years. I was wrong. ZOMORODI: Colette, I mean, it's so upsetting. And knowing what you know now, like, what happens if there is another Katrina? How does it work? Where do people go? PICHON BATTLE: There is another Katrina on the way. We can't start from any other premise. The mass displacement that comes with a hurricane like Katrina is unbelievable. The first wave is people who are, I would say, in the working class, folks who have a car and the ability to leave. ZOMORODI: Yeah. PICHON BATTLE: There's another wave of displacement that comes with sort of mandatory evacuation, so whatever a city has to get the poorest people out. And those folks are often given one-way tickets to a place they've never heard of. ZOMORODI: Ugh (ph). PICHON BATTLE: And the third round of displacement is probably the most heartbreaking for me, which is if you are a parent with a small child or an elderly person with a condition, you now have to go somewhere safe. And you end up shifting your residence not because you want to but because the structures and conditions that you need to have your life aren't here. There were no hospitals. There were no schools. And so you can't fault people for leaving. But when those - that third group of people leave, they leave for a very long time, if not for good. ZOMORODI: But it's not like these things aren't foreseeable, right? I mean, how prepared are government agencies like FEMA for a future with more natural disasters, which means more climate migration? PICHON BATTLE: Well, this is interesting, and it's the right question. What do we have in place for climate change? And I was honored to be invited to the White House to a conversation with FEMA. ZOMORODI: And to be clear, this was during the Obama administration, right? PICHON BATTLE: Yeah - specifically about our preparedness and resiliency. But the FEMA administrator said, I understand what you're saying, but the FEMA regulations aren't meant for the most vulnerable communities. The disaster process of this country are meant for the middle class. ZOMORODI: Wait. What? PICHON BATTLE: They're meant for the middle class. If you think about it, it sounds strange, right? Your heart - like, that can't be true, except the truth of it is that all of the laws in this country are meant for the middle class at best. There is a large swath of people who are never included. This was an honest comment from the head of FEMA. This is what you realize when you recognize that the structures that are in place right now are absolutely not meant for me. And so if we're going to survive this, we're going to have to figure some things out for ourselves while we go through the process of saving our democracy and shifting our laws and structures. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)PICHON BATTLE: By the end of the next century, it's predicted that more than 180 million people will be displaced due to climate change. And in south Louisiana, those who can afford to do so are already moving. They're moving because south Louisiana is losing land at one of the fastest rates on the planet. We must start preparing for global migration today. This will cause rounds of climate gentrification. Climate gentrification that happens in anticipation of sea level rise is what we're seeing in places like Miami, where communities that were kept from the waterfront are now being priced out of the high ground, where they were placed originally, as people move away from the coast. And climate migration is just one small part, but it's going to have ripple effects in both coastal cities and cities in the interior. So what do we do? We must reframe our understanding of the problem. Climate change is not the problem. Climate change is the most horrible symptom of an economic system that has been built for a few to extract every precious value out of this planet and its people. To survive this next phase of our human existence, we will need to restructure our social and economic systems to develop our collective resilience. ZOMORODI: Colette, I mean, on a day-to-day basis, what does that look like for you? How do you keep up this energy? PICHON BATTLE: Yeah, you know, I have, over the last couple of years, called into my life a more spiritual approach to my work. So it's an honor now. It used to be a duty, and now I see it as an honor. This work will make me hate the water or even fear it, and that is absolutely not who I am or where I come from. It would even make me hate this place - right? - and hate people, and that is also not who I'm from. We are not a people who are energized by hatred. I come from people who are energized by joy. And we're real, real loud, just like that swamp, you know? All those crickets and all that - you can hear us. You can smell us. You can come join us any time. That's who I come from, and I was losing it. And so I have been on a spiritual journey. We're running a Sacred Waters Pilgrimage right now with Black and Native women to heal the relationships of Native and Black folks with each other and to heal the relationship of humanity with our water, with our Earth. We are literally doing a pilgrimage down the Mississippi River for the next seven months to make sure that we advance this not using legislation, not even using technology - using traditional ecological knowledge and cultural traditions to advance our relationships with one another and our understanding of this planet and the water that she holds, which is our life. ZOMORODI: The Sacred Waters Pilgrimage - what exactly happens on this? Can you tell me more about it? UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: (Singing) Heya (ph). PICHON BATTLE: So we pray (laughter). Black and Native women and Two-Spirit folks are invited to join the pilgrimage, and we come together, and we develop collective ceremony using African tradition and Native traditions. We started Juneteenth at the headwaters in Minnesota, interestingly enough the state where George Floyd was killed. This was planned last year in July, by the way. The water called us to that place. ZOMORODI: Wow. PICHON BATTLE: And so the prayers that were offered were not just that we heal our relationship with this Earth, but it was that we humans heal our relationship with one another. And that is a place full of pain. You can feel it as soon as you arrive. And so we come together. We pray. We sing. We honor each other. We have courageous conversations about our histories with one another and what colonizing forces had Black folks do to Native folks and what colonizing forces had Native folks do to Black folks. And we ask for reconciliation and forgiveness because we know that if the victims of the original sins of this country can get together and form a united front, we can actually change this country. ZOMORODI: That's Colette Pichon Battle. She's the executive director of the Gulf Coast Center for Law & Policy in Louisiana. You can see her full talk at ted. com.

A new study indicates people are able to answer math questions, yes or no questions, like BJ Leiderman wrote our theme music, all while in a state of lucid dreaming. Karen Konkoly is a Ph. D. student at Northwestern University and one of the researchers working on the project. Thanks so much for being with us. KAREN KONKOLY: Yeah, thanks so much for having me. SIMON: This study, published in the journal Current Biology, dealt with people who were lucid dreaming. Lucid dreaming is? KONKOLY: It's when you're inside a dream and you realize that you're dreaming without immediately waking up. So sometimes you can go and control the dream as well. SIMON: Well, tell us about the experiment. First, you had to train people how to lucid dream, I gather. KONKOLY: Right. So even if you have an experienced lucid dreamer, they might only lucid dream once a month. We needed them to lucid dream in the next two hours. So before people go to sleep, for 20 minutes, we associate this lucid mindset, this critically aware, kind of mindful state while they're awake with a cue. And the cue that we used was just a beeping noise. It was just boop, boop, boop. And then we present the cue again once they start dreaming when they're asleep. And in an initial study, half of people had a lucid dream after we presented the cue during REM sleep. SIMON: So you have discovered you're able to communicate with people while they're dreaming? KONKOLY: Yeah. So since the '80s, we've known that lucid dreamers can communicate out of dreams by using these signals, these preserved capabilities that you have in REM even though most of your body is completely paralyzed. SIMON: REM is rapid eye movement sleep. KONKOLY: Yes, exactly. So in rapid eye movement sleep, unlike when you're sleeptalking, for instance, every muscle in your body is completely paralyzed, except you can twitch and you can move your eyes. So if you become lucid in a dream and you want to communicate, then when people are dreaming, they just look left, right, left, right really dramatically. And then we know that they're communicating out. But we were wondering, can we also communicate in? Can we ask people questions that they could actually hear in their dreams so that we could kind of have a more meaningful conversation? SIMON: Oh, my gosh. Questions like what? KONKOLY: So there's four teams from four different countries, and three of them - independently, 'cause we didn't know about each other's experiments - all settled on math problems. But the French group also asked a bunch of other questions. They asked, like, do you speak Spanish, or do you like chocolate? And they did a few other different tasks as well - how many times did we tap you on the hand? - to just test out different ways of communicating. SIMON: I'm going to guess the French team asked questions like, you know, do you know the meaning of life, or what is existentialism to you - some things like that, probably - right? KONKOLY: (Laughter) They did have an amazing example where one of their participants heard the questions transposed over their dream as though it was God talking to them. SIMON: A lot of people, as I don't have to tell you, report that they've been having very vivid dreams during this pandemic - I certainly have - and some real nightmares. Is there the key to something in your research? KONKOLY: Yeah. So one issue is that, sometimes, if somebody's having a nightmare, they might become lucid. They might be, you know, running from a monster or something, know that they're dreaming and not be able to do anything. And so one, you know, probably far-future application could be if you had somebody in a lucid nightmare, could you have some, like, real-time dream therapy with them, you know? Could you have a therapist on the other side of that nightmare saying, like, no. Remember? You're dreaming. Like, you wanted to turn around and, like, you know, confront that monster and deal with the nightmare issue or something like that, so. SIMON: Wow. Other applications that occur to you if you can crack this? KONKOLY: Yeah. I think if we can get more reliable communication - 'cause right now, it's still kind of at the very beginning stages. Another one could be, like, people often use lucid dreaming or dreaming for a kind of artistic, creative inspiration. But in that dream state, your resources thus far are only the ones that you have in the dream. And so if you could have somebody on the other side of that saying, like, OK, now focus on this, or how does that relate to this, you could kind of combine those logical advantages of wake with the creative advantages of dreams and maybe have some more applications. SIMON: Ms. Konkoly, we've just met, so forgive the intimate question. Do you dream? KONKOLY: Yes, all the time. Love dreaming. SIMON: You dream about dreams, given your line of work? KONKOLY: (Laughter) Yeah. A lot of my dreams are about dreams, you know? I get very frustrated when I have a dream about lucid dreaming, but it's not lucid. Like, I'll dream about, you know, all these scientific concepts of lucid dreaming, and then I won't have any idea that I'm dreaming (laughter). Sometimes I do, though, and those are amazing. SIMON: Karen Konkoly is first author of the paper \"Real-Time Dialogue Between Experimenters And Dreamers During Rapid Eye Movement Sleep. \" Thank you so much, and pleasant dreams. KONKOLY: Thank you. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SCOTT SIMON, HOST:   Two-way communication is possible while dreaming. A new study indicates people are able to answer math questions, yes or no questions, like BJ Leiderman wrote our theme music, all while in a state of lucid dreaming. Karen Konkoly is a Ph. D. student at Northwestern University and one of the researchers working on the project. Thanks so much for being with us. KAREN KONKOLY: Yeah, thanks so much for having me. SIMON: This study, published in the journal Current Biology, dealt with people who were lucid dreaming. Lucid dreaming is? KONKOLY: It's when you're inside a dream and you realize that you're dreaming without immediately waking up. So sometimes you can go and control the dream as well. SIMON: Well, tell us about the experiment. First, you had to train people how to lucid dream, I gather. KONKOLY: Right. So even if you have an experienced lucid dreamer, they might only lucid dream once a month. We needed them to lucid dream in the next two hours. So before people go to sleep, for 20 minutes, we associate this lucid mindset, this critically aware, kind of mindful state while they're awake with a cue. And the cue that we used was just a beeping noise. It was just boop, boop, boop. And then we present the cue again once they start dreaming when they're asleep. And in an initial study, half of people had a lucid dream after we presented the cue during REM sleep. SIMON: So you have discovered you're able to communicate with people while they're dreaming? KONKOLY: Yeah. So since the '80s, we've known that lucid dreamers can communicate out of dreams by using these signals, these preserved capabilities that you have in REM even though most of your body is completely paralyzed. SIMON: REM is rapid eye movement sleep. KONKOLY: Yes, exactly. So in rapid eye movement sleep, unlike when you're sleeptalking, for instance, every muscle in your body is completely paralyzed, except you can twitch and you can move your eyes. So if you become lucid in a dream and you want to communicate, then when people are dreaming, they just look left, right, left, right really dramatically.

We know that. But how fast is it happening? To answer that with some degree of precision, climate scientists are digging into these dusty handwritten archives. Here's NPR's Lauren Sommer. LAUREN SOMMER, BYLINE: Just off the coast of Liverpool, England, there's a small, windswept island known as Hilbre Island. No one lives there now, but in the late 1800s, a handful of people did. They ran a telegraph station, launched lifeboats and recorded the tide levels every day. ANDY MATTHEWS: I can just about see some of the buildings. SOMMER: Andy Matthews lives close to Hilbre Island, where the remains of those buildings still are. He's also a data scientist at the Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level, an organization that gathers ocean data worldwide. That's where those old tidal records are now kept, along with others, like from the Port of Liverpool. To help ships dock safely in the 1800s, workers there dutifully wrote down tidal data every 15 minutes in huge handwritten tables. MATTHEWS: You can see some of them have a very intricate handwriting, and other ones are pretty squirrelly as well (laughter), so. . . SOMMER: Altogether, it's tens of thousands of pages of extremely detailed scientific data. MATTHEWS: We've never got them off the ledgers. So they're not in a digital format at the moment for us to use in our research. SOMMER: Matthews is hoping to make it usable. He's posted them on a site called Zooniverse so volunteers can help. With many people stuck at home, he's hoping they'll pitch in with the transcription online. And it's not just about historical preservation; the data is crucial to understanding climate change because it sets the baseline. THOMAS FREDERIKSE: One of the really difficult things of sea level rise is that it happens everywhere on a different pace. SOMMER: Thomas Frederikse studies sea level rise at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. He says oceans are rising because glaciers are melting. So are the ice sheets on Antarctica and Greenland. The oceans are also warmer, and warmer water expands. So sea level could rise between 3 and 6 feet by the end of the century. But it'll be slightly different in every city. FREDERIKSE: Sea level rise is not rising everywhere with the same speed. Like, for example, the U. S. East Coast has seen a lot of sea level rise. SOMMER: It's not like a bathtub, where the water rises evenly. The Earth's crust is slowly changing all the time. A huge weight, like a massive ice sheet, pushes the crust down. When the ice melts, the Earth slowly rebounds, kind of like a cushion when you get off the couch. Frederikse says historical records reveal how these processes work, and that's key for forecasting future sea levels in different parts of the world. FREDERIKSE: If we don't have that information, it's easy to be, like, a few feet off if we don't have local records of sea level. SOMMER: There's a problem, though. Most of the historical records are from the U. S. and Europe. ARIEL TROISI: The Southern Hemisphere - it's not really well covered. SOMMER: Captain Ariel Troisi is technical secretary of the Naval Hydrographic Service of Argentina. He's been working to recover historical records from the Port of Buenos Aires to help fill in the gap of data from the Southern Hemisphere. On some papers, the ink is already fading. TROISI: These observations are unrepeatable. So if we don't recover them, it's difficult to understand what has happened. SOMMER: In Cameroon in Central Africa, tidal data is in the archives of former colonizers. As colonial powers extracted resources from African countries, they kept detailed maritime records. Ph. D. student Yannick Fossi Fotsi is piecing together records from when Germany and France took control of Cameroon, starting in the late 1800s. YANNICK FOSSI FOTSI: (Speaking French). SOMMER: \"You can't accurately predict sea level worldwide without records from African countries,\" he says. But he's also hoping the data will provide a clearer forecast for his own country. Douala, the economic capital, already experiences extreme floods. To prepare a city of millions for sea level rise, they'll need detailed local forecast informed by records from the past.

It was signed, sealed but never delivered. Now scientists have used a high-tech scan to peek inside without unfolding it. NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce reports on why they didn't just open it. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE, BYLINE: Envelopes as we know them today didn't exist until the 1830s. Before then, people would write a letter and then fold the sheet of paper up into its own neat, little package. This was an everyday part of life for hundreds of years. JANA DAMBROGIO: And the most important thing is that people intentionally built in tamper-evident devices. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Jana Dambrogio is a conservator with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Libraries. She says security devices included combinations of slits, folds, creases, tucks. DAMBROGIO: And there's so many ways. And they can make it look like it's less secure and have security hidden on the inside, or they can make something look very secure, but it actually isn't that secure on the inside. GREENFIELDBOYCE: All of this is called letterlocking. It hasn't gotten much attention. In the past, if a scholar wanted to read a sealed letter, an archivist would just cut it open. DAMBROGIO: That takes precedence, that opening to read words and text. And what we're saying is, what do we lose when we open the unopened? GREENFIELDBOYCE: Her group has been closely studying letterlocking and was intrigued to learn of an old postmaster's trunk found in the Netherlands. It was filled with letters from the 17th century. Hundreds of them had never been opened. So researchers started running sealed letters through a device that was originally designed to study teeth. It provided a detailed, three-dimensional X-ray image. Team member Amanda Ghassaei says the ink shows up as a bright region on the scan, but initially, it's impossible to read. AMANDA GHASSAEI: Everything's kind of jumbled together. Many layers of paper are going to be pressed close together and, you know, words kind of overlapping each other. GREENFIELDBOYCE: She says the challenge was to manipulate that data and virtually unfold it. GHASSAEI: And actually kind of generate something that looks like an image of the letter if it had been opened and flattened. But in reality, you know, we haven't even touched the letter. All we've done is scanned it. GREENFIELDBOYCE: In the journal Nature Communications, they show how a computer can do it. They describe one sealed letter from 1697. It turns out to be a message from a man in France to his cousin in the Netherlands, asking for an official death certificate for another relative. It's just a normal piece of family business. But Dambrogio says the folds are lovely. DAMBROGIO: This one has the most beautiful pattern. In one sequence, it makes an arrow shape, which folds in on itself and is sealed with a little piece of adhesive. GREENFIELDBOYCE: There are many, many other sealed letters that could be studied in the same way, like ones in mail packages that the British navy seized from enemy ships, for example. And the new technique impressed other scholars like Brent Seales. He's a computer scientist at the University of Kentucky who's virtually unwrapped ancient scrolls that are too fragile to be unrolled. BRENT SEALES: They revealed the text, which was awesome. To do that without opening the letter is itself a sort of miracle, which I love. But they were also complete about the technology of the artifact itself. GREENFIELDBOYCE: And they fully disclosed their whole process step by step. He says that kind of transparency is super important. SEALES: You know, they told you in their paper what a letter says inside without ever opening it. You have to have some kind of trust in that.

President Biden hopes prioritizing teachers for vaccines will help. Here's what he said Tuesday. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: My challenge to all states, territories and the District of Columbia is this - we want every educator, school staff member, child care worker to receive at least one shot by the end of the month of March. MARTIN: But even if all teachers are vaccinated in coming weeks, the vast majority of schools don't have the space to implement the social distancing guidelines currently set out by the CDC. Managing the education crisis brought on by the pandemic is now the job of Miguel Cardona, who has just been confirmed as the new education secretary. He's put out a plan to help get schools open. That includes a national summit later this month. And he joins us now. Secretary Cardona, thanks so much for being here. MIGUEL CARDONA: Thank you. Thank you for having me, Rachel. MARTIN: As we just heard, President Biden challenged states to give a vaccine shot to every educator and school staff member before the end of this month. How do you compel states to make that happen? CARDONA: I applaud that charge. First of all, it is our shared goal to reopen schools safely and quickly. You know, I haven't met an educator that doesn't agree that students learn best in school. And they really want our students to be learning in schools. So it's just a matter of implementing it in a manner that is expeditious and is aimed at really reopening schools quickly. MARTIN: Although the CDC says vaccinating teachers is not a requirement for opening schools safely. CARDONA: You're right, Rachel. I can tell you from my experience in Connecticut, where over 90% of the students have an opportunity to learn in person today and many students were learning in person before the vaccine was even approved, it can be done with the mitigation strategies, a careful adherence to the mitigation strategies and close monitoring and, where necessary, quarantining and closing if the numbers escalate to the point where you can't safely assure students are in schools. However, we know that vaccination is a strategy that can just accelerate safe school reopening. MARTIN: Is part of this just making teachers and staff comfortable with the idea of getting back in the classroom? CARDONA: We know that there has to be a culture of trust, understanding, transparency. It's really making sure that there's an understanding and a level of trust and comfort to reopen schools safely. And I think that's really why the American Rescue Plan is important because it's going to ensure that we have those technical strategies, those - the ability to modify schools and provide the PPEs that are needed. It gives us an opportunity to really address that digital divide once and for all and provide the long-term needs. This is not just about turning on the lights, not just about unlocking the doors and letting students in. This is about recovering and making sure we're providing that important social, emotional development and support that our students need after experiencing a trauma like we just faced. MARTIN: So let's talk about the the physical upgrades that would need to happen. I mean, if we're talking about getting kids in school full-time in person by the fall, I mean, the CDC recommends a physical distance of at least 6 feet between students. So it doesn't matter how many teachers to get back into schools. If schools don't have the physical space to meet that guideline, it's not going to happen. Is that guideline going to change? CARDONA: You know, first - I heard you say fall. We really need to reopen schools quickly and safely as soon as possible. And distancing is critically important. As you know, that's one of the strategies that we've been working with and we see in those districts that are successful bringing students back in. So following those mitigation strategies is critical in ensuring that, again, with the American Rescue Plan, we have the resources needed to expand and provide those environments that our students need to have safe in-person learning. MARTIN: So does that mean putting money into building bigger schools across this country or is the requirement for 6 feet of social distancing going to be amended? CARDONA: I know that some of the funds can be earmarked for providing staffing if you are spreading students out or using different parts of the building differently. So, for example, yesterday in my visit with the first lady to Ben Franklin School in Marion, Conn. , I saw that the gymnasium was converted for part of the day into a classroom. So that takes resources. And fortunately, with the warm weather we can have - coming soon, we can have classrooms set up outside. And that's going to take resources as well. So I think it can be done, and it can be done safely. MARTIN: I talked to a high school teacher from the Bay Area in California yesterday who told me she is very worried about her students who have just disappeared. I mean, they don't engage their video. They don't turn in homework. Or they just don't even log in to virtual classes at all. And we've heard this concern from a whole lot of teachers across the country over the past year. How are you, as the secretary of education, going to get those kids back? CARDONA: You know, that teacher really speaks to the heart of the issue here. Every day that passes, students are being disengaged from that sense of community that schools provide. So part of our effort is to really collect data on the disengagement of students and ensure that our resources and our policy are aimed at closing those gaps that are being exacerbated. We know that some students are having better access to learning remotely than others, and we have to monitor that and make sure that we're providing resources to re-engage those students into that school community that, you know, as a parent myself, I know how important it is for our students to be reconnected into their school community, not only for the academics, but for that sense of family that schools provide. MARTIN: America's public education system, I don't have to tell you, was already suffering before the pandemic from chronic underfunding. In your tenure, are you going to be able to address some of the problems that existed before? Or are you going to just try to get back to neutral, just get public education back to the baseline of what it was pre-COVID? CARDONA: We would be missing an opportunity if our goal was to be what we were on March 10 of last year. We really have to move forward. We have to recover from this pandemic, which is not - like I said earlier, it's a longer process to reconnect our students and connect them with what they've missed and make sure that we have schools that are prepared to meet the social, emotional needs of our students. And this is a fresh opportunity for us to convene educational stakeholders, people that are in the classrooms, people - parents, students - to really reimagine and say, what do we want our system to look like? And how can we ensure a system that meets every child's ability where they are and gives them the same opportunity for success in life? We had work to do before the pandemic, it's just been exacerbated now, these gaps. And we have to be unapologetic getting into that and making sure that what we plan forward is better than what we ever had before. MARTIN: Education Secretary Miguel Cardona, thank you so much for your time this morning. CARDONA: Pleasure to be with you. Thank you. MARTIN: Listening into that conversation, NPR senior education correspondent Cory Turner. Cory, thanks for being here. Huge challenges ahead for this next secretary of education. CORY TURNER, BYLINE: Yeah. It was really interesting to hear the urgency in his voice when he mentioned the fall. And he's like, I'm focused on the right now. And I'll be curious to see what these administration efforts, both the push to vaccinate teachers, the $130 billion that schools hope will be coming to them through the new COVID relief package, it'll be interesting to see what impact that has on school reopening in the next month or two. MARTIN: And whether or not that guidance on social distancing will change, sounds like he is, at least at this point, encouraging schools to use the space they have, think creatively about the outdoors. TURNER: Yeah, I think that's an issue we're really going to have to re-excavate come August. MARTIN: NPR education correspondent Cory Turner. Thank you. TURNER: Thank you, Rachel. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:   What's it going to take to get all schools open for full-time in-person learning this fall? President Biden hopes prioritizing teachers for vaccines will help. Here's what he said Tuesday. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: My challenge to all states, territories and the District of Columbia is this - we want every educator, school staff member, child care worker to receive at least one shot by the end of the month of March. MARTIN: But even if all teachers are vaccinated in coming weeks, the vast majority of schools don't have the space to implement the social distancing guidelines currently set out by the CDC. Managing the education crisis brought on by the pandemic is now the job of Miguel Cardona, who has just been confirmed as the new education secretary. He's put out a plan to help get schools open. That includes a national summit later this month. And he joins us now. Secretary Cardona, thanks so much for being here. MIGUEL CARDONA: Thank you. Thank you for having me, Rachel. MARTIN: As we just heard, President Biden challenged states to give a vaccine shot to every educator and school staff member before the end of this month. How do you compel states to make that happen? CARDONA: I applaud that charge. First of all, it is our shared goal to reopen schools safely and quickly. You know, I haven't met an educator that doesn't agree that students learn best in school. And they really want our students to be learning in schools. So it's just a matter of implementing it in a manner that is expeditious and is aimed at really reopening schools quickly. MARTIN: Although the CDC says vaccinating teachers is not a requirement for opening schools safely. CARDONA: You're right, Rachel. I can tell you from my experience in Connecticut, where over 90% of the students have an opportunity to learn in person today and many students were learning in person before the vaccine was even approved, it can be done with the mitigation strategies, a careful adherence to the mitigation strategies and close monitoring and, where necessary, quarantining and closing if the numbers escalate to the point where you can't safely assure students are in schools. However, we know that vaccination is a strategy that can just accelerate safe school reopening. MARTIN: Is part of this just making teachers and staff comfortable with the idea of getting back in the classroom? CARDONA: We know that there has to be a culture of trust, understanding, transparency. It's really making sure that there's an understanding and a level of trust and comfort to reopen schools safely. And I think that's really why the American Rescue Plan is important because it's going to ensure that we have those technical strategies, those - the ability to modify schools and provide the PPEs that are needed. It gives us an opportunity to really address that digital divide once and for all and provide the long-term needs. This is not just about turning on the lights, not just about unlocking the doors and letting students in. This is about recovering and making sure we're providing that important social, emotional development and support that our students need after experiencing a trauma like we just faced. MARTIN: So let's talk about the the physical upgrades that would need to happen. I mean, if we're talking about getting kids in school full-time in person by the fall, I mean, the CDC recommends a physical distance of at least 6 feet between students.

And now finally, onto the aging brain and, for women, a stage in life that most people associate with changes in the body rather than brain function - menopause. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)LISA MOSCONI: We associate menopause with the ovaries. But when women say that they're having hot flashes, night sweats, insomnia, memory lapses, depression, anxiety, those symptoms don't start in the ovaries. They start in the brain. ZOMORODI: This is neuroscientist Lisa Mosconi on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)MOSCONI: Those are neurological symptoms. We're just not used to thinking about them as such. So just to clarify, if this is you, you are not crazy. (LAUGHTER)ZOMORODI: Not crazy because women's brains age differently than men. And Lisa's research is just beginning to shed light on how and why that is. MOSCONI: And this is really important because the way the brain ages is really, in big part, dependent on the health of the reproductive system in women. And the reason for that is that their hormones play a big role in brain function. And this is a connection that's been really overlooked systematically for decades, probably centuries, really. ZOMORODI: And we should just mention that when we're - we say women, we're referring to those born in bodies with ovaries. And as we've talked about on the show before, there are a lot of people that don't fit into that description. MOSCONI: Yes. ZOMORODI: And so in your TED talk, you say that the brain and the ovaries are connected. Like, it's like they're talking to each other all the time, right? MOSCONI: (Laughter) Yes. Yes, they do from the moment we're born. So the brain is connected to the reproductive systems via a network that is called the HPG axis, which is hypothalamus pituitary-gonadal axis, which - yeah, which is a very important system that connects specific parts of the brain like the hypothalamus, which is - for example, is in charge of regulating body temperature but also is in charge of making hormones like estrogen and progesterone. And then there's the pituitary gland, which is in charge of making other hormones. And all these hormones together are responsible for the menstrual cycle in women, and they're connected to the ovaries, the gonadal system. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)MOSCONI: Men have testosterone. Women have more estrogens. But what really matters here is that these hormones differ in their longevity. Men's testosterone doesn't run out until late in life, which is a slow and pretty much symptom-free process, of course. Women's. . . (LAUGHTER)MOSCONI: Right? Women's estrogens, on the other hand, start fading in midlife during menopause, which is anything but symptom-free. So when women say they're having hot flashes - right? - that's the most common symptom of menopause. They're having night sweats or depression, anxiety, brain fog - it's a very common symptom - memory lapses. Those symptoms don't start in the ovaries. They start in the brain. And what we have shown is that the symptoms are very likely caused by energy changes inside the brain. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)MOSCONI: So the health of the ovaries is linked to the health of the brain and the other way around. At the same time, hormones like estrogen are not only involved in reproduction but also in brain function. And estrogen in particular, or estradiol, is really key for energy production in the brain. At the cellular level, estrogen literally pushes neurons to burn glucose to make energy. If your estrogen is high, your brain energy is high. When your estrogen declines, though, your neurons start slowing down and age faster. For women, brain energy is usually fine before menopause, but then it gradually declines during the transition. And this was found independent of age. It didn't matter if the women were 40, 50 or 60. What mattered most was that they were in menopause. ZOMORODI: So, Lisa, you were doing more research into this. But basically, are you finding that women's brains are more sensitive to hormone changes as we age? MOSCONI: Well, from my perspective, it means that the role of your hormones is a little bit stronger in your brain. ZOMORODI: If you're female. MOSCONI: Yes, if you're a female because you're already wired to go through not just puberty, but also, there's an expectation that you're going to be pregnant and have kids and then eventually lose your fertility and survive it. So I think there's more - and this is speculative, but I think there's more that needs to happen in a woman's body. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)MOSCONI: So this is the brain anatomy of menopause, if you will. When estrogen doesn't activate the hypothalamus correctly, the brain cannot regulate body temperature correctly. So those hot flashes that women get - that's the hypothalamus. Then there's the brainstem in charge of sleep and wake. When estrogen doesn't activate the brainstem correctly, we have trouble sleeping. Or it's the amygdala, the emotional center of the brain close to the hippocampus, the memory center of the brain. When estrogen's levels ebb in these regions, we start getting mood swings perhaps and forget things. See; I think it's really important to appreciate that for women, there's a very different story going on. And we should be more focused on the health of our hormones and really protecting our hormones because they have really strong effects on our brains. ZOMORODI: Is that similar to why - I have hypothyroidism, or Hashimoto's, a thyroid disorder. MOSCONI: Yeah. ZOMORODI: And when I was diagnosed with that, it was like, oh, this happens to a lot of women. MOSCONI: Yes, this is one of the things that we're looking into right now. We know that menopause acts a little bit like a trigger for existing medical predispositions. If you have a hormonal problem to start with, like thyroid issues, those are really likely to become an actual problem during menopause. Anxiety - there's a good chance that you're going chance that you're going to get more. . . ZOMORODI: Great. MOSCONI: . . . After menopause. ZOMORODI: Awesome. MOSCONI: Sorry (laughter). But it's true. You know, the thing is that we don't talk about it. ZOMORODI: No. MOSCONI: I specialize in Alzheimer's prevention, the reason being that I have a family history of Alzheimer's that runs in my family and really affects the women in my family pretty heavily. And Alzheimer's disease actually affects more women than men. So currently, in the United States, of every three Alzheimer's patients, two are women. . . ZOMORODI: Wow. MOSCONI: . . . Which really means that for every man suffering from Alzheimer's, there are two women. Alzheimer's disease starts with negative changes in the brain years, if not decades, prior to clinical symptoms. And my work in particular has shown that Alzheimer's disease starts earlier in women's brains than men's brains, specifically in midlife and even more specifically during the transition to menopause. ZOMORODI: I've never heard that, actually. MOSCONI: I find it so bizarre that this is not common knowledge and it's not something your doctors warn you about. And society's just absolutely unprepared. And doctors mostly are unprepared to really help women during this inevitable part of life. Like, all these symptoms that women have, in my opinion, could be avoided. ZOMORODI: How? MOSCONI: Oh, by living a certain lifestyle or taking certain medications or taking certain precautions. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)MOSCONI: Food, for example - studies have shown that the Mediterranean diet in particular is supportive of women's health. Women on this diet have a much lower risk of cognitive decline, of depression, of heart disease, of stroke and of cancer. And they also have fewer hot flashes. What's interesting about this diet is that it's quite rich in foods that contain estrogens in the form of phytoestrogens, or estrogens from plants, that act like mild estrogens in our bodies, especially from flax seeds, sesame seeds, dried apricots, legumes and a number of fruits. And for some good news, dark chocolate contains phytoestrogens, too. So diet is one way to gain estrogens, but it's just as important to avoid things to suppress our estrogens instead, especially stress. Stress can literally steal your estrogens. And that's because cortisol, which is the main stress hormone, works in balance with our estrogens. So if cortisol goes up, your estrogens go down; your cortisol goes down, your estrogens go back up. So reducing stress is really important. It doesn't just help your day. It also helps your brain. So these are just a few things that we can do to support our brains, and there are more. But the important thing here is that changing the way we understand the female brain really changes the way that we care for it. ZOMORODI: Lisa, we have gone from talking about babies' brains to adolescent brains to adult brains. And now we are talking about what happens in women's brains as they go through menopause and transition into this sort of last stage in their lives as seniors. And I guess, you know, we have spanned all that time. But I'm wondering, in the next five, 10 years, what are you hoping to discover with your research? Like, what is the question that you want to answer or understand about our aging brains? MOSCONI: Well, I think there's so much that really needs to be done. And I work in the medical field. And still today, women's brain health is one of the most underresearched, underdiagnosed and undertreated fields of medicine. Even though women have twice the risk of anxiety and depression as men, we're three times more likely to have an autoimmune disorder, including those that attack the brain, like multiple sclerosis. We're four times more likely to have headaches and migraines. We're much more likely to develop a brain tumor, like a meningioma. We're far more likely to die of a stroke when we get a stroke, and we're also more likely to get Alzheimer's disease, which is the most common form of dementia on the planet and really a major public health issue. And if we don't understand how women's brains work, we will not be able to really help them. ZOMORODI: That's neuroscientist Lisa Mosconi.

ZOMORODI: I've never heard that, actually. MOSCONI: I find it so bizarre that this is not common knowledge and it's not something your doctors warn you about. And society's just absolutely unprepared. And doctors mostly are unprepared to really help women during this inevitable part of life. Like, all these symptoms that women have, in my opinion, could be avoided. ZOMORODI: How? MOSCONI: Oh, by living a certain lifestyle or taking certain medications or taking certain precautions. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) MOSCONI: Food, for example - studies have shown that the Mediterranean diet in particular is supportive of women's health. Women on this diet have a much lower risk of cognitive decline, of depression, of heart disease, of stroke and of cancer. And they also have fewer hot flashes. What's interesting about this diet is that it's quite rich in foods that contain estrogens in the form of phytoestrogens, or estrogens from plants, that act like mild estrogens in our bodies, especially from flax seeds, sesame seeds, dried apricots, legumes and a number of fruits. And for some good news, dark chocolate contains phytoestrogens, too. So diet is one way to gain estrogens, but it's just as important to avoid things to suppress our estrogens instead, especially stress. Stress can literally steal your estrogens. And that's because cortisol, which is the main stress hormone, works in balance with our estrogens. So if cortisol goes up, your estrogens go down; your cortisol goes down, your estrogens go back up. So reducing stress is really important. It doesn't just help your day. It also helps your brain. So these are just a few things that we can do to support our brains, and there are more. But the important thing here is that changing the way we understand the female brain really changes the way that we care for it. ZOMORODI: Lisa, we have gone from talking about babies' brains to adolescent brains to adult brains. And now we are talking about what happens in women's brains as they go through menopause and transition into this sort of last stage in their lives as seniors. And I guess, you know, we have spanned all that time. But I'm wondering, in the next five, 10 years, what are you hoping to discover with your research? Like, what is the question that you want to answer or understand about our aging brains? MOSCONI: Well, I think there's so much that really needs to be done. And I work in the medical field. And still today, women's brain health is one of the most underresearched, underdiagnosed and undertreated fields of medicine. Even though women have twice the risk of anxiety and depression as men, we're three times more likely to have an autoimmune disorder, including those that attack the brain, like multiple sclerosis. We're four times more likely to have headaches and migraines. We're much more likely to develop a brain tumor, like a meningioma. We're far more likely to die of a stroke when we get a stroke, and we're also more likely to get Alzheimer's disease, which is the most common form of dementia on the planet and really a major public health issue. And if we don't understand how women's brains work, we will not be able to really help them. ZOMORODI: That's neuroscientist Lisa Mosconi.

And the brain continues to grow and transform all the way through adolescence until about the age of 26. Beyond that, people used to believe that the adult brain stopped growing new neurons. But that's not the case. SANDRINE THURET: Yeah, yeah, of course. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, on average, people would produce 700 new neurons per day. ZOMORODI: This is neuroscientist Sandrine Thuret. THURET: We all agree that this is a very small number. You know, you don't need a lot of these new neurons because it's part of a network. You don't need a lot to disturb the whole network. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)THURET: So I think that although this is a small number, but it doesn't prevent them from having very specific functions, let's say, or important functions. ZOMORODI: Sandrine studies neurogenesis, the process of creating new neurons. THURET: And when you are very young - so let's say, you know, until four years old - you have a lot of neurogenesis going on. You would have a burst of neurogenesis. But it goes down as you age. And that continues well into the 90s. So there is something that is happening, but it's not everywhere in the brain. ZOMORODI: For adults, that growth is happening in one area of the brain - the hippocampus. THURET: So the hippocampus is really a hub that's going to have multiple role. I mean, most people will think that, yeah, this is for memory. And it's right, it is for memory formation, but it's also important for mood and emotion. So indeed, in the hippocampus, you still keep adding neurons that are important for your mental health in general, like cognition and, you know, mood. And this is something that you can try to control to some extent without stressing yourself too much. ZOMORODI: Can we just pause here and say, like, what a relief it is to know that there is neural activity, neural growth in the adult brain? But it does sound like you're saying, you know, it's not just the way the brain works, it's that we actually can do something about it, too. THURET: So yeah. Well, exactly. I mean, like, what if you are aware of it, right? What do you do about it now? Because it's a very sensitive phenomenon, that, you know, you can increase it or decrease it, like, super quickly, you know, with lots of intervention that you do every day. ZOMORODI: In just a minute, neuroscientist Sandrine Thuret on what we adults can do to promote our neurogenesis and help our brains be healthier. On the show today, healthy brain development at every stage of life. I'm Manoush Zomorodi, and you're listening to the TED Radio Hour from NPR. Stay with us. It's the TED Radio Hour from NPR. I'm Manoush Zomorodi. Today on the show, how our brains change through every stage of life. And we were just hearing neuroscientist Sandrine Thuret explain the process of neurogenesis, our brain's ability to create new neurons. And even though adults won't grow as many neurons as kids or teenagers, our daily choices can help. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)THURET: Can we control neurogenesis? The answer is yes. And we are going to do now a little quiz. So I'm going to give you a set of behavior and activity, and you tell me if you think they will increase neurogenesis or if they will decrease neurogenesis. ZOMORODI: This is Sandrine Thuret on the TED stage. During this quiz, she went through six ways that we adults can promote our brain health. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)THURET: So what about learning - increasing? Yes. So learning will increase the production of these new neurons. So we know that learning itself will increase neurogenesis. So learning, you know, a new language, of course - why not? But, you know, the hippocampus is one of the center for spatial recognition. So maybe not exercising always the same route - you know, if you go outside for a walk or for a run, maybe taking a new one or maybe even taking a way you don't know yet. ZOMORODI: OK, so let's move to the second one, which was stress. THURET: So, yeah, stress. Well, this - you know, chronic stress, that's really bad for neurogenesis. And I know at the moment it's very difficult to do anything against, you know, stress, but this is really detrimental for neurogenesis. So having positive action, like learning - you know, this is how you maybe could counteract some of the detrimental effect of the stress. ZOMORODI: OK, so sleep deprivation was the next one. This makes sense to me. THURET: Yeah. Yeah. So it's quite intuitive, indeed. You know, when you are sleep deprived, you know, you cannot think straight, but it's over time. If you are going to look at this chronic sleep deprivation, that would be negative. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)THURET: How about sex? Oh, wow. (LAUGHTER)THURET: Yes, you are right. It will increase the production of new neurons. However, it's all about balance here. We don't want to fall in a situation. . . (LAUGHTER)THURET: . . . About too much sex leading to sleep deprivation. (LAUGHTER)ZOMORODI: This one got a laugh from the audience. THURET: Yeah, intercourse. Yes. Yes. So, yeah. So that's a good one to keep in mind, indeed. ZOMORODI: And finally, diet and exercise. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)THURET: How about running? So I will let you judge that one by yourself. So activity impacts on neurogenesis, but that's not all. What you eat will have an effect on the production of new neuron in the hippocampus. So calorie restriction of 20 to 30% will increase neurogenesis. Intermittent fasting - so spacing the time between your meal - will increase neurogenesis. Intake of flavonoid, which is contained in dark chocolate or blueberry, will increase neurogenesis. Omega-3 fatty acid, present in fatty fish like salmon, will increase the production of these new neurons. Conversely, a diet rich in high saturated fat will have a negative impact on neurogenesis. Ethanol, intake of alcohol, will decrease neurogenesis. However, not everything is lost. Resveratrol, which is contained in red wine, has been shown to promote the survival of these new neurons. So next time you are at a dinner party, you might want to reach for this possibly neurogenesis-neutral drink. ZOMORODI: So, you know, I do understand that research has not definitively shown that these things promote neurogenesis. But listening to you, part of me wants to fast and only eat salmon, blueberries and dark chocolate and run six miles a day and make sure I get nine hours of sleep every night because it makes me think, like, wow, I might have some control over my body. But also, like, Sandrine, we are only human, and it's just not possible to do all these things. So I guess I'm wondering, like, what is the biggest single piece of advice you have for us on how to make sure our brains stay healthy? THURET: Yeah. So I think people will have to find their own balance because if you are pushing yourself too hard, then this is another form of stress, right? ZOMORODI: (Laughter). THURET: So. . . ZOMORODI: Right. THURET: You want to do something that feels good to you, right? But, yeah, people have to find what works for them, I think, because otherwise if you have to force yourself, then it's counterproductive because it's going to be a stress. ZOMORODI: You know, I'm at that age where I'm starting to - I'm in my late 40s. I'm starting to think about the next phase. I'm not there yet. But is there some way to sort of prepare myself for the senior years, as it were? THURET: I don't know (laughter). ZOMORODI: Yeah, right? THURET: I mean, I think. . . ZOMORODI: That's the big question, isn't it? THURET: Yeah, that's a really good question. I'm sure you can. I'm sure we can all do our best. You know, from the data we have, it does show that what you do in your younger year will have an impact, you know, on the long term. So I think you can prepare now, indeed. And hoping for the best, like I do. ZOMORODI: That's neuroscientist Sandrine Thuret. She leads the Adult Neurogenesis and Mental Health Laboratory at King's College London.

Because self-control shows strategy and planning, it's considered a sign of intelligence. Alex Schnell is a behavioral ecologist and the lead author of the study, and she joins us now from Sydney, Australia. Welcome. ALEX SCHNELL: Hi. Thank you so much for having me, Lulu. GARCIA-NAVARRO: So your study reminds me of the marshmallow experiment that was conducted back in the '70s to test the self-control of children. SCHNELL: Absolutely. That's where the study is adapted from. A team of scientists at Stanford University provided children with a marshmallow experiment, and they were offered one marshmallow that they could eat. But if they didn't eat it and were able to wait for 15 minutes, they were offered two marshmallows. About 50% of the toddlers caved in, and they would eat the marshmallow. And the other 50% would hold out for two marshmallows. There has been this kind of idea and increasing evidence to suggest that self-control is linked to general intelligence. GARCIA-NAVARRO: So tell me how this linked to your experiment with the cuttlefish. What did you do to the cuttlefish? I'm sure you didn't give them a marshmallow. SCHNELL: Absolutely. We first tested their food preferences for different foods that they would commonly eat. And from those results, we used their first-preference prey and their second-preference prey and essentially designed a test where they had to choose between the two preys. But each of the food items were placed in clear chambers within their tank. One chamber would open immediately, whereas the other chamber would only open after a delay. And that chamber contained their first preference. Once they made a choice between one of the food items, the other choice was taken away. And so this essentially tested whether they could resist the temptation of their second-preference food item and wait. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Why cuttlefish? SCHNELL: Seeing as cuttlefish can remember past events, I wondered whether they could also plan for the future, a type of intelligence that is quite sophisticated. And then my anecdotal inspiration stems from an experience that I had in the marine lab where a cuttlefish got into the frequent habit of drenching me with a cascade of water. GARCIA-NAVARRO: (Laughter). SCHNELL: Yeah. Most mornings, it happened when I would walk past her tank. The interesting thing is she only squirted me in the morning when it was time to participate in experiments, and she refrained from squirting me in the evening when I would be in the lab to feed her dinner. GARCIA-NAVARRO: (Laughter). SCHNELL: Is this selective squirting? Is she simply learning to associate my morning visits with something she didn't like, or is there an element of self-control and planning involved? GARCIA-NAVARRO: And what did your study find? SCHNELL: Yes, cuttlefish have the capacity for self-control. And what surprised me the most was that the level of self-control shown by adult cuttlefish was quite advanced. Animals like rats, chickens and pigeons - they find it difficult to resist temptation and have relatively lower levels of self-control, only waiting for several seconds, whereas animals such as chimpanzees, crows and parrots - they show more advanced self-control, and they can wait up to several minutes. And the cuttlefish in our study waited up to between 50 to 130 seconds. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Makes me think I'm not going to eat any more cuttlefish. SCHNELL: Yeah. When I started my PhD and I was working on cuttlefish, I took cuttlefish off the menu. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Alex Schnell is a behavioral ecologist at Cambridge University.

MIKE LOCKWOOD: Hello there. GARCIA-NAVARRO: So tell us about the moment you and your colleague in China discovered the Earth had experienced a space hurricane. LOCKWOOD: Well, it took about a year, all told, for us to work out what on earth was going on. This was a very quiet period. The geomagnetic field wasn't shaking around. The solar wind was incredibly slow. The magnetic field that normally causes bad space weather was in the quiet orientation. And we were very puzzled. And then colleagues in China started producing numerical simulations from a big numerical space weather model. And that began to firm up our ideas. And eventually, my Chinese colleagues came up with the idea of calling it a space hurricane. And I'll be honest I thought that was a bit cheesy. But it's not a bad analogy. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Yeah, I mean, we've heard about things like solar flares affecting satellite communications. Do space hurricanes affect us? LOCKWOOD: We're looking into the implications now. We do think it probably affects satellite communications and satellite navigation over the poles. We think this is a big change in the way energy is deposited into the upper atmosphere. And we think that might have effects on orbits, particularly spacecraft orbits, which move around a little bit, but, actually, even more, space junk. And that's what we're particularly looking at - is how space junk is reorganized by an event like this. GARCIA-NAVARRO: So why would it be important how a space hurricane interacted with space junk? LOCKWOOD: A good example would be the International Space Station. That has a shield. It's got a Whipple shield to protect it from space junk. And that can handle small bits. But a big bit of remnant of a satellite or something - it couldn't cope with that at all. And the only way that they can deal with this is to do dodging maneuvers. So you have to know when to dodge, basically, and how to dodge. So if you know more about the event, then you can work out how it is changing, you know, almost in real time. And that gives you a bit more confidence in your predictions about when you need to maneuver the space station out the way of something nasty. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Do you think that there have been other space hurricanes? And do you think you can predict them in the future? LOCKWOOD: We probably missed this for a long time because there was no flare. There was no massive geomagnetic activity. All the other things that normally go with large energy deposition in our upper atmosphere - they were missing. But now we know what one looks like. We'll look for more, obviously. And then we'll know how frequent they are and things like that. GARCIA-NAVARRO: And final question - what does it feel like to sort of discover something like this? LOCKWOOD: It's always a nice feeling. Now, I'm a sage, old guy. I've been around a while. What's really nice is Qing-He, the lead author. I mentored him when he first came over to the West to learn about space. It's really nice to see a young scientist breaking through like this. And he's done a good job. And I'm proud of him. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Professor Mike Lockwood from the University of Reading, thank you very much. LOCKWOOD: You're more than welcome. LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST:   This is Lulu's log - stardate March 7, 2021 - where we explore matters of space, the stars and the universe. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GARCIA-NAVARRO: Today, the space hurricane. In 2014, a massive storm of electrons 600 miles wide swirled counterclockwise above the North Pole for eight hours. Scientists only recently proved its existence and published findings this month in the journal Nature Communications. Researchers at the University of Reading in the U. K. , led by another team at Shandong University in China, came up with the report. Mike Lockwood is a professor at Reading. And he joins us now from Oxford. Welcome to the program.

Extreme weather is increasingly causing these kinds of disasters around the country. So some communities are keeping the power on for vulnerable people and infrastructure by installing giant batteries. NPR's Lauren Sommer has more. LAUREN SOMMER, BYLINE: As the power outage dragged on in Austin, a lot of residents worried about heat. But another problem quickly emerged. Without power, there's no water, as Austin Water Director Greg Meszaros alerted the community. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)GREG MESZAROS: Our Ullrich Treatment Plant, which is our largest plant, had experienced an electrical disruption and was out of service. SOMMER: The main water treatment plant went dark, which meant the water wasn't clean enough to drink. Water infrastructure needs power, something that became very clear almost a decade ago in New Jersey. ANDREW POWERS: I'll never forget driving that day, and the whole state was just black. SOMMER: Andrew Powers is with PSEG, an electric utility in New Jersey. Superstorm Sandy had caused the largest power outage in state history, including at sewage treatment plants. Many had backup generators, but they didn't hold up. POWERS: It took several weeks for the state to really come back. Generators were destroyed, and they weren't able to get diesel fuel to their generator. SOMMER: Without power, wastewater treatment plants can't clean the sewage, and many were flooded by the storm. Billions of gallons of untreated sewage were released into waterways. Powers says the storm was a wake-up call, so the utility began installing these. (SOUNDBITE OF BATTERY HUMMING)SOMMER: That hum comes from a giant battery, about as tall as a person. At the wastewater treatment plant in Caldwell, N. J. , it's connected to solar panels. POWERS: In the event of a storm, we're prepared during those outages or those - let's say that prolonged outage. Sun comes out. The solar generates energy. SOMMER: That solar energy helps run the plant. And when the sun goes down, the battery kicks in. Combined with the backup generator, Powers says the plant could run like this for weeks. The utility also installed battery and solar systems at other key spots, like a hospital and a high school that can serve as a warming or cooling center during extreme weather. But sometimes during blackouts, people need solutions closer to home. In Northern California, Richard Terrano's life changed when the Camp Fire burned through his town in 2018. RICHARD TERRANO: It basically took an entire community and wiped it out. I've lived here, oh, 50 years, and everything that I knew prior to the fire is gone. SOMMER: Since then, Terrano faces regular blackouts during fire season when the utility turns off the power to reduce fire risk. It's a problem because he needs supplemental oxygen, and that medical equipment runs on electricity. He tried using a small generator, but the fuel runs about a hundred dollars a day, and he's on a fixed income. TERRANO: It'll take your entire monthly fuel budget. It'll eat it up in a matter of hours. SOMMER: Then he heard about a program from the California Foundation for Independent Living Centers, in partnership with the utility PG&E, to loan out portable batteries. TERRANO: Probably about 18 inches square. It's like a large block, and it'll run my equipment for several days before a recharge is necessary. SOMMER: Almost 3,000 batteries are being loaned to Californians with medical needs this year because the blackouts will keep coming. MELISSA LOTT: I remember being in Texas in 2011 and having a four-hour blackout in the middle of that cold storm. SOMMER: Melissa Lott is research director at Columbia University's Center on Global Energy Policy. LOTT: People are going, once-in-a-century storm. Here we are 10 years later with an even more extreme storm. SOMMER: Lott says batteries can help keep crucial services running when that happens. While the cost is coming down, they're still more expensive than traditional power sources, though maybe not when you compare it to the cost of these blackouts. LOTT: If we'd really saw that risk coming and we did a calculation, we might figure out it's a heck of a lot cheaper. In the back of the envelope, calculations say it's a heck of a lot cheaper to invest in some of the technologies we didn't invest in. SOMMER: No electric grid is perfect, she says, especially with climate change creating more extremes. So the key is to be ready when things go wrong. Lauren Sommer, NPR News.

It's about transgender athletes in sports. Now, most of these bills are aimed at limiting or prohibiting transgender athletes from competing in women's sports. Right now, about 35 such bills are being considered in 20 states, according to the LGBT rights group Human Rights Campaign. Just days ago, Mississippi Governor Tate Reeves signed one such law, which is scheduled to go into effect later this year. Now, supporters of these bills say they are necessary to reduce what they think is an inherent competitive advantage of transgender athletes who identify as female, which could even make competition in some sports unsafe for other girls and women. But advocacy groups like the ACLU say that is false, that these laws are discriminatory and really just another culture war bugaboo of the right. They also argue that if allowed to stand, they will open the door to humiliating treatment of many women and girls just because they don't look a certain way. Right now, we want to take a step back from the culture war aspect of this and learn what the science says. For that, we turn to Dr. Eric Vilain. He holds an MD and a PhD. He is a pediatrician and geneticist at Children's National Hospital here in Washington, D. C. He has studied sex differences throughout his career, and he's also advised the International Olympic Committee on these issues. And he is with us now. Dr. Eric Vilain, thank you so much for joining us. ERIC VILAIN: I'm glad to be here. MARTIN: So before we jump in, I just want to say that I don't think everybody is necessarily familiar with the terms that we might use. So to get everybody on the same page, I'd like to ask you to quickly define some key terms as briefly as you can. What exactly do we mean when we say transgender? And what exactly do we mean when we say cisgender? VILAIN: Transgender refers to individuals whose gender identity is different from their sex of birth, for example. And it's - they have typically transitioned from one gender to the other, hence the term trans. And cisgender is individuals who, by contrast, have not transitioned. MARTIN: As we mentioned, supporters of these bills say they are meant to eliminate any competitive advantage that transgender athletes may have. But those who oppose these laws say transgender girls don't have an inherent advantage over cisgender girls. At least, they don't have an advantage that is any greater than the normal variation within a group. And so I'd like to ask you if there is data on this, and what does it show? VILAIN: Yes, we know that men have on average an advantage in performance in athletics of about 10 to 12% over women, which the sports authorities have attributed to differences in levels of a male hormone called testosterone. The question is whether there is in real life, during actual competitions, an advantage of performance linked to this male hormone and whether trans athletes are systematically winning all competitions. The answer to this latter question - are trans athletes winning everything? - is simple. That's not the case. And higher levels of the male hormone testosterone are associated with better performance only in a very small number of athletic disciplines - 400 meters, 800 meters, hammer throw, pole vault. And it certainly does not explain the whole 10% difference. And lastly, I would say that every sport requires different talents and anatomies for success. So I think we should focus on celebrating this diversity rather than focusing on relative notions of fairness. For example, the body of a marathon runner is extremely different than the body of a shotput champion. And a trans woman athlete may have some advantage on the basketball field because of her height but would be at a disadvantage in gymnastics. So it's complicated. And more and more, many trans women athletes, for example, will take gender-affirming hormones, which will reduce their muscle mass and red blood cells, which carry the oxygen necessary for better performance. And that will also reduce the speed, the strength and the endurance. MARTIN: At the high school level, are transgender athletes taking those hormone-suppressing drugs? VILAIN: So at a high school level, many trans youth do delay their puberty, which means that even if they are not taking these gender-affirming hormones, their natural puberty in their biological sex is not happening, therefore resulting in a delay and an absence of an effect on muscle mass, at least for the male-to-female situation. So the supposed advantage of muscle mass and red blood cells because of testosterone becomes moot in middle and often high school competitions when there have been puberty blockers involved. MARTIN: One of the groups that has come out against these types of laws is the National Women's Law Center. They wrote a brief against a bill in Idaho that seeks to ban transgender girls from participating in youth female sports. And in it, they write, quote, \"the law allows anyone for any reason to question whether a student athlete is a woman or girl. And then the student has to verify her gender by undergoing invasive testing, which could include a gynecological exam, blood work or chromosome testing. \" And one of the plaintiffs in this is - was a plaintiff named Jane Doe, who was a cisgender female athlete, but she doesn't normally wear skirts or dresses and has an athletic build. And they're saying that under a law like this, somebody could just ask or insist that this athlete undergo one of these exams to prove her gender, that that's inherently harmful and serves no legitimate purpose. What do you say to that? VILAIN: You know, it's interesting because in the field of sports, there's a long history of discrimination that targets women that look different. Again, the science of whether testosterone in real life is actually providing an advantage in competition is not clearly established. But more disturbingly is that all these rules at the elite level have affected women - not all women, but women with a Y chromosome. And often, it's triggered by women who look different. So I'm a little disturbed to hear that these issues at the elite level are now reaching the middle and high schools and colleges. MARTIN: As we said, these - there are a number of these bills making their way through state legislatures. Moving forward, how would you like people to think about this debate? Is there something you would encourage people to think about? Or. . . VILAIN: I would encourage parents and people interested in sports to look at all the sides of the issue and not being fixated on the sole issue of gender. There are so many different attributes for an athlete that make them so diverse, so interesting, so different. Some will be good at one sport. Some will be good at other sports. And we should just celebrate this diversity. MARTIN: That is Dr. Eric Vilain. He's a pediatrician and geneticist at Children's National Hospital. He's been an adviser both to the NCAA and the International Olympic Committee. Dr. Vilain, thank you so much for being with us and sharing your expertise. VILAIN: You're very welcome.

Now Iran is saying if the U. S. doesn't lift those sanctions, it will stop allowing some inspections of its nuclear facilities. Here's NPR's Geoff Brumfiel. GEOFF BRUMFIEL, BYLINE: For months, Iran has been slowly enriching more uranium, which can be used for nuclear reactors or potentially for weapons. It's also been testing new technologies. And it's doing all this in protest because after the U. S. pulled out, Iran never received the economic relief it was promised in exchange for ramping down its nuclear program. But until recently, there was one thing Iran wouldn't touch, according to Dina Esfandiary of the International Crisis Group. That was the nuclear inspections conducted by the International Atomic Energy Agency. DINA ESFANDIARY: Iran tends to stay away from pestering the IAEA. BRUMFIEL: Since the start of the deal, IAEA inspectors have fanned out across the entire nation, monitoring not just Iran's nuclear facilities, but its R&D and even the mines where it extracts natural uranium. Inspectors have collected reams of data that feed into reports on exactly what Iran is up to. But Iran ended its powerful inspection agreements last month. That was by order of the nation's conservative parliament, which passed a law saying some inspections must cease until the promised sanctions relief arrives. ESFANDIARY: That was basically Iran's parliament's way of trying to regain control of the entire process because they were getting fed up. BRUMFIEL: In late February, IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi raced to Tehran to try and find a solution. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)RAFAEL GROSSI: Thank you for being here.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)GROSSI: We got a reasonable result after what was a very, very intensive consultation negotiation with our Iranian counterparts. BRUMFIEL: The exact agreement between Iran and the IAEA remains confidential, but Corey Hinderstein of the Nuclear Threat Initiative says the goal was to preserve data. Take, for example, cameras that monitor warehouses and workshops. COREY HINDERSTEIN: The information would be stored in the camera or at the location, but nobody would look at those images. BRUMFIEL: Normally, the IAEA would see this kind of information right away. But now, if you kind of think of Iran's nuclear program as a book. . . HINDERSTEIN: What this is is basically tearing out the pages but putting them in a sealed envelope off to the side. BRUMFIEL: The data will be held for up to three months. If by then Iran has received some economic benefits, it would be restored. But. . . HINDERSTEIN: If there's no political arrangement, then that data would be dumped. BRUMFIEL: And that would be a big problem, says Ellie Geranmayeh of the European Council on Foreign Relations, because to other countries, all that data inspectors have collected on Iran's program has been extremely valuable. ELLIE GERANMAYEH: I think that inspection verification aspect of the deal has been the main reason why, for example, European countries to this agreement have stuck by the deal. BRUMFIEL: Even as Iran has broken the limits it originally agreed to. Today, Iran is far closer to having a nuclear weapons capability than it was before the Trump administration left the deal, though it appears not to be pursuing that option for now. But if the U. S. and Iran can't revive the agreement and the cameras are shut off for good, it will become much harder to tell what Iran is up to. Geoff Brumfiel, NPR News, Washington.

Admittedly, that's a hard one to follow, but here goes - they also think they have found the world's oldest intact basket. Here's NPR's Daniel Estrin in Jerusalem. DANIEL ESTRIN, BYLINE: The Dead Sea Scrolls include the oldest-known copies of biblical texts, written more than 2,000 years ago and discovered in desert caves along the Dead Sea starting in the 1940s and '50s. Now Israeli government archaeologists say they've found more fragments. OREN ABLEMAN: For the first time in over 60 years, we have biblical fragments that were discovered in an excavation and brought directly here to our conservation lab. ESTRIN: Oren Ableman of the Israel Antiquities Authority. It was a race against looters. An ancient papyrus found by antiquities hunters in the area tipped off officials that more scrolls could still be hidden in the caves. For the last four years, Israeli archaeologists rappelled down desert cliffs and searched nearly all of the approximately 500 known caves along the shore of the Dead Sea. In one cave in Israel, they found a bundle of tiny, crumpled parchment pieces in ancient Greek. ABLEMAN: When we deciphered it, turned out to be Zechariah 8:16-17. ESTRIN: The verse reads, render truth and justice in your gates. ABLEMAN: Now, something very surprising that we found in this fragment was that the last word on Verse 16, justice in your gates, instead of the word gates, we have the word streets here. ESTRIN: He thinks it could be a copying error. In the time of the biblical prophets, trials were carried out at the gates of a city, but when the scribe wrote this Greek translation hundreds of years later in the first century B. C. , he may have been used to seeing trials carried out in city streets. Everything's written in ancient Greek, except for one word. ABLEMAN: Right there. ESTRIN: He and a conservator wearing blue gloves point to the four-letter name of God in ancient Hebrew. ABLEMAN: That's - kind of tell us a bit about the importance of the name of God, that even in a text that is translated into Greek, the name of God is still in the ancient Hebrew script, probably part of way of showing how holy the name is. ESTRIN: The archaeologists found even older artifacts. CHAIM COHEN: The most exciting thing that we found in my opinion, that we found in the project - (laughter). ESTRIN: Archaeologist Chaim Cohen displays a huge, intricately woven basket, about 10,500 years old, completely intact, and found buried in another Dead Sea cave in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.

Researchers have identified a new species of mosquito in Florida. It's known to carry several diseases, including yellow fever. Here's NPR's Greg Allen. GREG ALLEN, BYLINE: The life of a mosquito researcher isn't a glamorous one, but Lawrence Reeves likes it. LAWRENCE REEVES: Yeah. I think it's really cool. I'm a big nerd for this stuff. LINDSAY CAMPBELL: (Laughter). REEVES: So it's really easy to collect mosquitoes. ALLEN: Reeves is a research scientist with the University of Florida. And his collaborator is entomologist Lindsay Campbell. One way you collect mosquitoes is with a vacuum. (SOUNDBITE OF VACUUM)ALLEN: In a video he recorded, Reeves traipses through undergrowth. REEVES: It's kind of like \"Ghostbusters. \" You go around in the field sucking up mosquitoes with these vacuums. And then you end up with a bag of hundreds or thousands of mosquitoes that you have to sift through to identify. ALLEN: Sifting through mosquitoes collected near Everglades National Park, Reeves spotted some that he hadn't seen before. Examining them under a microscope and then analyzing their DNA, he realized they were a species new to Florida, one called Aedes scapularis. Up to now, they've been found mostly in the Caribbean and Latin America. In Brazil, Reeves says, the mosquitoes have been found to be infected with a range of diseases. REEVES: Things like Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, yellow fever virus and a handful of others. ALLEN: It's been more than a century since there was a yellow fever outbreak in the U. S. And although they're infected, it's not clear if Aedes scapularis mosquitoes spread the diseases. But as outbreaks of Zika and dengue have shown in Florida, new mosquitoes can bring new diseases. The species is already established here, and a study suggests it may spread north along Florida's Gulf and Atlantic coasts. And there are other things about Aedes scapularis that are worrisome. It's a mosquito that likes going indoors and feeds on both wildlife and people. Campbell says that's not good. CAMPBELL: If you end up with a species that's capable of transmitting to bats and likes to also bite humans, that's the prime condition for a spillover event. ALLEN: Scientists believe the COVID-19 pandemic is a result of such a spillover event involving bats or another animal species. Climate change, international travel and global trade are also factors. Ten new species of non-native mosquitoes have been found in Florida since 2000. And Reeves says more are on the way. REEVES: There's one in particular right now that a lot of people are worrying about, Aedes vittatus, which is kind of an old-world vector for pretty much everything that we're worried about - dengue, chikungunya, Zika. ALLEN: Originally from India, Aedes vittatus mosquitoes have now been found in Cuba, just 90 miles from Florida. Greg Allen, NPR News, Miami. [POST-BROADCAST CORRECTION: In this report, Lindsay Campbell says, \"If you end up with a species that's capable of transmitting to bats and likes to also bite humans, that's the prime condition for a spillover event. \" Campbell misspoke and meant to say birds.

GREG ALLEN, BYLINE: The life of a mosquito researcher isn't a glamorous one, but Lawrence Reeves likes it. LAWRENCE REEVES: Yeah. I think it's really cool. I'm a big nerd for this stuff. LINDSAY CAMPBELL: (Laughter). REEVES: So it's really easy to collect mosquitoes. ALLEN: Reeves is a research scientist with the University of Florida. And his collaborator is entomologist Lindsay Campbell. One way you collect mosquitoes is with a vacuum. (SOUNDBITE OF VACUUM) ALLEN: In a video he recorded, Reeves traipses through undergrowth. REEVES: It's kind of like \"Ghostbusters. \" You go around in the field sucking up mosquitoes with these vacuums. And then you end up with a bag of hundreds or thousands of mosquitoes that you have to sift through to identify. ALLEN: Sifting through mosquitoes collected near Everglades National Park, Reeves spotted some that he hadn't seen before. Examining them under a microscope and then analyzing their DNA, he realized they were a species new to Florida, one called Aedes scapularis. Up to now, they've been found mostly in the Caribbean and Latin America. In Brazil, Reeves says, the mosquitoes have been found to be infected with a range of diseases. REEVES: Things like Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, yellow fever virus and a handful of others. ALLEN: It's been more than a century since there was a yellow fever outbreak in the U. S. And although they're infected, it's not clear if Aedes scapularis mosquitoes spread the diseases. But as outbreaks of Zika and dengue have shown in Florida, new mosquitoes can bring new diseases. The species is already established here, and a study suggests it may spread north along Florida's Gulf and Atlantic coasts. And there are other things about Aedes scapularis that are worrisome. It's a mosquito that likes going indoors and feeds on both wildlife and people. Campbell says that's not good. CAMPBELL: If you end up with a species that's capable of transmitting to bats and likes to also bite humans, that's the prime condition for a spillover event. ALLEN: Scientists believe the COVID-19 pandemic is a result of such a spillover event involving bats or another animal species. Climate change, international travel and global trade are also factors. Ten new species of non-native mosquitoes have been found in Florida since 2000. And Reeves says more are on the way. REEVES: There's one in particular right now that a lot of people are worrying about, Aedes vittatus, which is kind of an old-world vector for pretty much everything that we're worried about - dengue, chikungunya, Zika. ALLEN: Originally from India, Aedes vittatus mosquitoes have now been found in Cuba, just 90 miles from Florida. Greg Allen, NPR News, Miami. [POST-BROADCAST CORRECTION: In this report, Lindsay Campbell says, \"If you end up with a species that's capable of transmitting to bats and likes to also bite humans, that's the prime condition for a spillover event. \" Campbell misspoke and meant to say birds. Mosquito-borne diseases are not known to be transmitted between bats and people. ] (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)", "section": "National", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2021 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Welcome to the Anthropocene. Here's NPR's Rebecca Hersher. REBECCA HERSHER, BYLINE: Humans have changed the planet in a lot of ways. That's where the idea of the Anthropocene Epoch comes from - anthro, Greek for human. Nicholas Kawa is an anthropologist at Ohio State. NICHOLAS KAWA: There's lots of different debates about the Anthropocene and where it starts. There are some people that see an old Anthropocene that could go all the way back to when we see humans, you know, controlling and using fire like a hundred thousand years ago. HERSHER: Others feel like the turning point was when humans started large-scale agriculture. KAWA: And then there's another camp that sees it as occurring more recently with industrialization. And so I think there's kind of an old Anthropocene and a new Anthropocene. HERSHER: Many of the scientists who are focused on the new Anthropocene are geologists because industrialization is really when you start to see a clear line or layer in the rock that says humans were here. There are chemicals, tiny bits of plastic, carbon and nitrogen from burning fossil fuels, even radioactive elements from nuclear blasts, all of which get into mud and soil and ice and end up being part of the geological record. Simon Turner is one of the leaders of the Anthropocene Working Group, a group of scientists who are trying to officially define the start date for the Anthropocene. SIMON TURNER: It's like a dream job. HERSHER: In his actual job at University College London, Turner studies how humans affect aquatic systems like lakes. But right now, he's spending a lot of time helping groups of scientists all over the world look for what's called a golden spike location. Every geological time period has one of these reference spots somewhere on Earth that perfectly captures what makes that period unique. Usually, it's a distinct layer of rock in a cliff or maybe in an ice core, like debris from the meteor that killed the dinosaurs. That layer is really obvious at this one place in Tunisia. TURNER: The idea of a golden spike is you have this series of markers of the Anthropocene. HERSHER: Turner is coordinating a global effort to find this perfect spot. Right now, there are 11 potential sites on five continents - an Antarctic ice core, bays in the U. S. and Japan. TURNER: So sequences of mud, of coral, of stalagmites in caves. HERSHER: Peat bogs in Europe, a lake in China. One of the sites is a reservoir in California. It was built in the late 1800s, and it's special because a ton of sediment has collected at the bottom over the years. ALLISON STEGNER: And at this point, there's over 11 meters of sediment since 1892. HERSHER: Allison Stegner is a geologist at Stanford who's leading the golden spike team for the reservoir. Her team has removed a three-story-tall, 127-year-old cross section of the mud in the reservoir. And they're looking for evidence of humans, especially radioactive elements and evidence of burning fossil fuels. STEGNER: We can actually look at what happens seasonally over the last 127 years, which is really, really rare. HERSHER: Stegner's team might be able to pinpoint the beginning of the Anthropocene down to a specific year. And although the analyses are not finished, this team and others seem to be zeroing in on the year 1952 or so. That's when big thermonuclear tests spread radioactive material around the world, which would mean that some baby boomers are literally older than the Anthropocene. It also means that the age of humans will likely be defined by some of humanity's most destructive actions. Nick Kawa, the anthropologist, says it's important to reflect on that. KAWA: You think of so many nasty facets of human history that we like to kind of sweep under the rug. And it could actually be helpful in the sense that like, OK, we're using an atomic bomb to define the human era. What does that say about us? And what do we want future markers to look like? HERSHER: The Anthropocene Working Group expects to wrap up work on all 11 potential golden spike sites by summer 2022. Rebecca Hersher, NPR News.

S. land and U. S. waters. The goal is to protect 30% of the land and 30% of the water, which is a lot. Climate change will complicate that goal because warming temperatures are changing what is happening just offshore and altering what needs to be preserved. NPR's Lauren Sommer reports. LAUREN SOMMER, BYLINE: A few years ago, marine biologist Kyle Van Houten saw a video online of a small, great white shark. It was young, only about five feet long, and it was swimming right off a pier in California's Monterey Bay. (SOUNDBITE OF VIDEO)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Oh. KYLE VAN HOUTEN: It was almost hard to believe. Our initial reaction was that can't be true. We know they're in Southern California and Mexico, not in Monterey. SOMMER: Young white sharks normally hang out hundreds of miles south in the warm waters of Southern California. Van Houten and his colleagues at the Monterey Bay Aquarium have tracked them there. But starting in 2014, they began showing up in Monterey because the water is warmer. VAN HOUTEN: There was this event, this marine heat wave in the North Pacific, which we called the blob, and that was some of the warmest water we've ever had in recorded history off of the west coast of the U. S. SOMMER: The shark's habitat had moved, and Van Houten says that's beginning to happen all over. VAN HOUTEN: Think what this tells us is this is not a story about sharks. This is a story about climate. The sharks are following their temperatures and their habitat. They're following their home as it moves. MIRIAM GOLDSTEIN: The oceans are literally taking the heat from climate change. SOMMER: Miriam Goldstein is director of ocean policy at the Center for American Progress. She says the oceans have been doing us a big favor. They've absorbed more than 90% of the heat in the atmosphere from human-caused warming in the last 50 years. So she says Biden's plan to cut emissions is also key for the oceans. But beyond that, the administration hasn't laid out its priorities yet. Biden has yet to nominate a key ocean role, the head of NOAA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. And Goldstein says there are urgent challenges for the agency. GOLDSTEIN: The fish that used to be in the Carolinas are in New Jersey. The fish that used to be in New Jersey are in New England. And our management system has not caught up. So we need to look at what it will take to help these fishing communities, fishermen, processors, adapt to what is unfortunately the new reality. SOMMER: Those can be tough conversations to have because for some fishermen, there's potentially a lot to lose. But some are ready to talk. ERIC BRAZER: Fishermen are the - you know, think about it like the canary in the coal mine, right? They are the ones who often see and experience these changes before anybody else does. SOMMER: Eric Brazer is deputy director of the Gulf of Mexico Reef Fish Shareholders' Alliance. He says a key issue will be the Biden administration's 30 by 30 goal to conserve 30% of the land and ocean by 2030. Historically, that's been contentious because protecting waters sometimes means putting them off limits to fishing. BRAZER: Fishermen's businesses are going to be impacted by this, and that's why it's especially critical for us to be at the table, be at the podium, have access to the managers and start to answer these questions that are unanswered at this point. SOMMER: Brazer says that's how the Biden administration can get buy-in. Everyone is looking for solutions, he says, because the oceans are changing in ways that no one can ignore.

NPR's Allison Aubrey joins us now. Allison, good morning. ALLISON AUBREY, BYLINE: Good morning, Steve. INSKEEP: How close can students be? AUBREY: Three feet now. You know, previously they had been recommending at least 6 feet, and they're saying that that should still be maintained in common areas such as auditoriums or wind masks are off, such as when you're eating. But otherwise, it can now be 3 feet, 3 feet of physical separation. And this is a big change, Steve, because the 6-foot guidance really meant that a lot of schools could only operate part time or on these hybrid schedules. . . INSKEEP: Yeah. AUBREY: . . . In order to reduce the number of kids in the class. This new 3-foot rule will allow many more schools to open in-person full time. INSKEEP: What is the science that would've allowed this change now? AUBREY: You know, a study published earlier this month in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases got a lot of attention, Steve. Researchers looked at schools in Massachusetts, where schools have been given a choice of distancing students either 6 feet or 3 feet apart. The study included more than, like, a half million students who attended school all last fall. And the researchers told me that they just didn't find any substantial difference in coronavirus cases among students or staff in the districts with the 3 feet versus the 6 feet. The authors conclude that this really added to the evidence that the safety of 3 feet is OK. Keep in mind the students in Massachusetts were masked - near universal masking. And today, in announcing this new guidance, the CDC pointed to new research from Missouri, from Florida and from Utah also adding to the evidence that 3 feet is OK. INSKEEP: You know, I've got this quote in front of me, and it does say that's 3 feet is OK, quote, \"in school settings,\" which feels important because in a school, everybody is presumably on the same page. They might be kids. They might be a little undisciplined, but everybody knows what the rules are. And most people can be made to follow the rules, which is different than ordinary life. AUBREY: Yeah. I would say that's right. And, you know, just also adding a few more data points here, the World Health Organization had been giving this guidance for a while. They had been recommending that schools keep kids one meter, which is 3. 3 feet apart. That's been happening in other countries. The American Academy of Pediatrics has been saying for a while that in many settings, the 6-foot standard just wasn't feasible. They've been advising flexibility. And I think a lot of teachers and superintendents are really going to appreciate this. I mean, these hybrid schedules have cut back on the number of days kids can be in the classroom. And some superintendents say that the hybrid schedules have reduced student engagement. I've seen this with my own kids. They're in school some days, on Zoom other days. Sometimes, there's asynchronous learning and the schedules can be confusing. It's all too easy for kids to sort of turn off that camera on Zoom. And that doesn't lead them to be the best students they can be. INSKEEP: Well, Allison, good luck to you and to your students at home - or at home part of the time. AUBREY: Thank you. Thanks, Steve.

PTSD, Depression. . . ZOMORODI: . . . Social anxiety. . . (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)DOBLIN: . . . Substance abuse. . . ZOMORODI: . . . Alcoholism. . . (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)DOBLIN: . . . And suicide. ZOMORODI: And so far, the results are promising. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)DOBLIN: Psychedelic psychotherapy is an attempt to go after the root causes of the problems with just a relatively few administrations, as contrasted to most of the psychiatric drugs used today that are mostly just reducing symptoms and are meant to be taken on a daily basis. ZOMORODI: But changing people's minds over the safety and efficacy of psychedelic drugs has taken decades. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)DOBLIN: In the 1950s and '60s, psychedelic research flourished and showed great promise for the fields of psychiatry, psychology and psychotherapy. But psychedelics leaked out of the research settings and began to be used by the counterculture and by the anti-Vietnam War movement. And so there was a backlash. (SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE)RICHARD NIXON: America's public enemy No. 1 in the United States is drug abuse. ZOMORODI: So there's this huge backlash. There's lots of fear. There's cautionary tales around psychedelics. But despite that, you decided to try it anyway. What was your experience like? DOBLIN: Well, I felt like this experience opened me up to emotions. It started making me more balanced and was really starting to make me think of existential questions, and who am I, and where am I, and where did I come from? When you shift from your ego orientation, where you don't see things from your individual perspective so much, you hear more a sense of the group and of how we're all interconnected. And this is only a few years after we had the first images of the Earth from space. And so my kind of awakening to psychedelics was, you could say, humanity's awakening to our place in the universe. And so this was like a drowning sailor in a crazy world finding this life preserver, which for me was LSD. ZOMORODI: So - OK, so there probably were a lot of college students who dropped acid and then went on to live a life, but you actually decided to dedicate your life to researching the effects of various different psychedelics on people's mental health. Tell me, like, how did that happen? DOBLIN: Well, when I had this experience with psychedelics and thought, just in the early stages, this could be a contribution to helping people overcome their sense of separateness and to build a healthier world, I thought, this is what I want to do. And so that's where, at age 18, I decided to go through my own psychedelic therapy, become a psychedelic therapist and try to bring back psychedelic research. ZOMORODI: Rick started down a long path to become a psychedelic-assisted psychotherapist, but he realized his dream couldn't come true if these drugs were illegal. And so he founded a group to help legalize psychedelics for medicinal use. Just a warning - parts of this next story may be hard to hear. It all started with one particular drug, MDMA, and Rick's friend named Marcela (ph). (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)DOBLIN: Marcela, who suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder from a violent sexual assault - Marcela and I were introduced in 1984 when MDMA was still legal, but it was beginning, also, to leak out of therapeutic circles. Marcela had tried MDMA in a recreational setting, and during that, her past trauma flooded her awareness, and it intensified her suicidal feelings. During our first conversation, I shared that when MDMA was - is taken therapeutically, it can reduce the fear of difficult emotions, and she could help move forward past her trauma. I asked her to promise not to commit suicide if we are to work together, and she agreed and made that promise. During her therapeutic sessions, Marcela was able to process her trauma more fluidly, more easily. And so being able to share the story and experience the feelings and the thoughts in her mind freed her, and she was able to decide that she wanted to move forward with her life. Now, 35 years later, after Marcela's treatment, she's actually a therapist, training other therapists to help people overcome PTSD with MDMA. ZOMORODI: So this experience really changed both of your lives. And in particular, though, it really launched you on a path to try and legitimize MDMA as a therapeutic drug. And I wonder - can you just tell me more about how it actually works in the brain? DOBLIN: Yeah. So what we do know is that MDMA releases serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine - sort of neurotransmitters It also releases a lot of hormones and, in particular, oxytocin. As well, MDMA impacts how the energy is distributed in the brain. And so it reduces activity in the amygdala, which is the fear-processing part of the brain. It increases activity in the prefrontal cortex, where we think logically, and it increases connectivity between the amygdala and the hippocampus, where memories are put into long-term storage. So the problem of PTSD is that the trauma from the past never really seems like it's in the past. It colors the present, and people see the present through the lens of the past and the lens of the past trauma. And so in this complex neurotransmitter release, hormonal release, energy that's shifted in how the brain is processing, it's actually the - in some ways, an ideal drug for PTSD. ZOMORODI: More from Rick Doblin and the clinical trials happening today to treat PTSD with psychedelics when we come back. On the show today, through the looking glass. I'm Manoush Zomorodi, and this is the TED Radio Hour from NPR. It's the TED Radio Hour from NPR. I'm Manoush Zomorodi, and on the show today, Through the Looking Glass. We're taking a look at the world, the universe and our own minds through specially built tools. And some people believe a tool to look through one's own mind is the psychedelic drug MDMA. DOBLIN: It's the most gentle of all the psychedelics, and MDMA was sort of the best for the mission of trying to bring back from the underground psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy. ZOMORODI: This, again, is Rick Doblin. He's a therapist and researcher at the forefront of psychedelic-assisted therapy. Rick and his team have spent decades running clinical trials and crafting therapies using MDMA to treat PTSD. One of his patients was Tony. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)DOBLIN: Tony was a veteran in one of our pilot studies. The treatment that Tony was to receive was three and a half months long. But during that period of time, he would only get MDMA on three occasions. We call our treatment approach inner-directed therapy in that we support the patient to experience whatever is emerging within their minds or their bodies. During Tony's first MDMA session, he lay on the couch. He had eyeshades on. He listened to music, and he would speak to the therapist whenever he felt that he needed to. In a moment of calmness and clarity, Tony shared that he had realized that his PTSD was a way of connecting him to his friends. It was a way of honoring the memory of his friends who had died. He was able to shift and see himself through the eyes of his dead friends, and he realized that they would not want him to suffer, to squander his life. They would want him to live more fully, which they were unable to do. And so he realized that there was a new way to honor their memory, which was to live as fully as possible. That was seven years ago. Tony is still free of PTSD and is helping others less fortunate than himself in Cambodia. (APPLAUSE)ZOMORODI: I mean, it's an incredible story. But, you know, was Tony a special case? How has the program done overall? What is the success rate? DOBLIN: So in phase two, we looked at the control groups. And what it turned out is that 23% at the two-month follow-up no longer qualified for a diagnosis of PTSD with therapy, basically. But when we add MDMA to the mix, now 56% no longer have PTSD. But even more important than that is the 12-month follow-up. And at the 12-month follow-up, two-thirds no longer had PTSD. ZOMORODI: OK, so you've seen it work in a therapeutic setting. But that doesn't mean that it would work for everyone or that there aren't any risks involved, right? DOBLIN: Yeah. So I think that psychedelics have a role to play in the survival and thriving of humanity, but it doesn't mean everybody should take them. And it also doesn't mean that psychedelics are the only way to get through these experiences. So I think one of the big mistakes of the '60s was that the advocates said, I've taken psychedelics; I know more than anybody; unless you've taken psychedelics, you don't really know what's going on, and exaggerated the benefits and minimized the risks. In the face of the government that was getting more and more scared about psychedelics and counterculture, they were denying the benefits, suppressing the research and exaggerating the risks. ZOMORODI: OK, so then what would you say is the biggest hurdle for you right now, Rick? Like, is it to be able to get MDMA into the hands of therapists and then to patients? Is it still regulations and the government? DOBLIN: Well, in the process of this, we have basically changed the attitudes of regulators. They actually would like us to succeed. I think the biggest concern that we have now is public education. It was the public fear in the '60s and '70s that led to the wiping out of psychedelic research around the world. The regulators were following sort of the attitudes of the public, who got frightened about problem use of psychedelics. But there's a general sense now that we are in the midst of a massive crisis of opiate overdoses, fentanyl overdoses, alcoholism, drug - deaths of despair. The need is greater than ever before. The war on drugs is seen more and more around the world as not a solution to drug abuse but as a contributor to drug abuse and to the black market. So all of this, I think, is that public education is the most important thing for us to do now. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)DOBLIN: I'm proud to say that we have now initiated our phase three studies. And if approved, the only therapists that will be able to directly administer it to patients are going to be therapists that have been through our training program. And they will only be able to administer MDMA under direct supervision in clinic settings. We anticipate that over the next several decades, there will be thousands of psychedelic clinics established, at which therapists will be able to administer MDMA, psilocybin, ketamine and other psychedelics to potentially millions of patients. And now if you all just look under your seats - just joking. (LAUGHTER)DOBLIN: Thank you. (APPLAUSE)ZOMORODI: That's Rick Doblin. He's founder of the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies. You can see his full talk at ted. com. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MANOUSH ZOMORODI, HOST:   On the show today, Through the Looking Glass. and so far, we've taken the looking glass quite literally - scientists peering into space or magnifying the tiny universes that exist in a drop of water. But how about we turn that looking glass inward and into our own minds? RICK DOBLIN: I think we can talk about the human mind, the unconscious, as the final frontier. ZOMORODI: This is therapist Rick Doblin. DOBLIN: And what we need to do is to engage in a deep understanding and exploration of the unconscious. ZOMORODI: And Rick researches the final frontier of the unconscious with psychedelics. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) DOBLIN: Preparing for this talk has been scarier for me than preparing for LSD therapy. ZOMORODI: Here he is on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) DOBLIN: Psychedelics are to the study of the mind what the microscope is to biology and the telescope is to astronomy.

I'm Manoush Zomorodi. Today, on the show, we are venturing Through the Looking Glass, extending our perception and exploring strange new worlds, including here on Earth. (SOUNDBITE OF WIND)ARIEL WALDMAN: So when you land on the packed snow runway in McMurdo, yeah, you don't see anything. It's just snow. So there's no trees. There's no bushes. There's no grass. There's none of that. (SOUNDBITE OF WIND)WALDMAN: Most people think of Antarctica as really desolate. You know, it's covered with over a mile of ice in many locations. It's the coldest continent. It's also extremely dry. It's a polar desert. But the thing that I feel like a lot of people don't know about Antarctica is that it's really brimming with life in a lot of different locations. It's just that most of it is invisible to us. You would need to have a microscope in order to see them. ZOMORODI: This is Ariel Waldman. She's a wildlife filmmaker at the microbial scale. WALDMAN: And I'm an adviser to NASA, and I'm also an Antarctic explorer. ZOMORODI: Ariel first became interested in Antarctic microbes back in 2013. She was working with NASA, and she met astrobiologists who study Antarctica's extreme conditions and the life forms that actually thrive there. WALDMAN: I had learned that a lot of biologists go to Antarctica, but they very rarely ever take any photos or videos of the creatures that they study there. And so I kind of saw an opportunity to really help both scientists and help people, you know, around the world actually get to see all this amazing stuff. ZOMORODI: So that realization - that is what inspired you to basically become the first filmmaker to document these hidden ecosystems. But how did you go from that inspiration to making it happen? WALDMAN: Yeah (laughter). ZOMORODI: It couldn't - it could not have been easy. WALDMAN: Going to Antarctica - it just required a lot of preparation. I prepared for months, and this was after it took me five years of applying to go to Antarctica and working towards becoming a wildlife filmmaker at the microbial scale. And so I was self-taught in microscopy. And then I ended up joining the San Francisco Microscopically Society, which I am now the president of (laughter) - super geeky. ZOMORODI: Wow. So you had to become an expert microscopist. Am I saying that right? WALDMAN: Yes, exactly. Exactly. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ZOMORODI: And so do you remember? Like, do you remember what it was like when you first got to put a sample under the microscope in Antarctica and peer into this tiny alien world for the first time? WALDMAN: (Laughter) Yeah, I just about fainted, I feel like. The very first sample I got to look at was from divers who had gone under the sea ice. And I had an idea of, like, a few of the different critters that I was going to see. But when I put the first sample under the microscope, I saw these beautiful diatoms, which are, you know, microalgae with glass shells, which are just beautiful. They're geometric gems of the sea and of different areas of water around the earth. But I found diatoms that had triangular shapes, and they just looked like they had been manufactured by humans. They're so gorgeous. And I - yeah, I don't know. I - it's hard to put it into words just how excited I was. ZOMORODI: OK, so talk us through it. Like, what was the plan for you and your trusty microscopes? WALDMAN: So the plan in Antarctica was to take my microscopes around to different locations and really be able to find life that was under the ice. So I was looking for life underneath the sea ice. I was looking for life embedded inside glacier ice, life that was near frozen lakes. And I would go around, and I would take samples from different locations. And some of the areas where I sampled that were more hardcore to get to, I would join up with another team. ZOMORODI: And one of those hardcore places was beneath the ice, like into the water. WALDMAN: (Laughter) Yeah, it was. . . (SOUNDBITE OF SPLASHING)ZOMORODI: Absolutely freezing water, right? WALDMAN: Yeah, this - absolutely freezing water. I believe the water is negative-2 Celsius. So because it's saltwater, it can go a little bit beyond the normal freezing point of water. And there are divers in Antarctica that regularly go down under 9-feet thick of sea ice and. . . ZOMORODI: Whoa. WALDMAN: . . . Explore the ocean down there. It's really amazing. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)WALDMAN: I was watching these divers, going like, why would anyone want to do that? ZOMORODI: Yeah. WALDMAN: That is freezing cold. Like, there's nothing that can be that worth it. But thankfully, there's this metal tube that McMurdo Station puts into the ice. And you can crawl down this tube. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)WALDMAN: And at the bottom of this tube, you're embedded between the sea ice and the sea floor. So you're kind of floating there, so to speak, with windows where you're able to see all of the life on the sea floor, and you can hear all of these amazing Weddell seals, which sound like synthesizers all around you. It's really magical, and it really changed my perspective on why anyone would ever want to be a diver in Antarctica. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)WALDMAN: So I could help direct divers to take collections from the sea ice ceiling and from the sea floor. And then I would take the samples back to the main laboratory at McMurdo Station and filter them and look at them under the microscope as freshly as I could so that I could see them interacting in the way that they would interact in their home environment. ZOMORODI: So tell us about the microbes that you found and the footage that you took of them. We're actually going to look at them and describe some of them here, and the first one is a tardigrade. Ariel, what is a tardigrade? WALDMAN: (Laughter) So a tardigrade is also known as a water bear or sometimes even a moss piglet. And they are tiny microscopic animals. They are actually animals. They have eight legs. They're incredibly cute. They look like little gummy bears with claws, I always like to say. They've got two little eye spots. Tardigrade means slow walker, so they are not the quickest microbes that you'll see under the microscope, but they're just adorable. And they're famous for being hardcore, for being able to survive extreme cold or extreme dryness, radiation and lots of other things. ZOMORODI: So it looks like to me, OK, yes, a gummy bear. You say gummy bear. I think it also looks like a manatee with eight arms. . . WALDMAN: (Laughter). ZOMORODI: . . . But then see-through and microscopic. And it's just kind of moving around with its little arms. What is it doing? WALDMAN: Yeah, so the little claws on tardigrades are really good at going through moss. So the most common environment that you'll find these tardigrades in is moss. And those claws allow them to be really nimble, but when you put one on a glass slide, it has trouble. It's kind of like an ice skating rink for it. So what you're seeing is a tardigrade which is able to navigate through moss fairly easily, but once it tries walking over the glass, it slips and slides and has trouble getting traction. ZOMORODI: Wow. So much going on for the little tardigrade. OK, so let's take a look at the next one. I'm just going to describe it. It's kind of oblong, translucent with what looks like these little green - I don't know - beach balls kind of moving around inside of it. Oh, and it's moving a bit. It's got a little shimmy. What is happening here, Ariel? Who is this? WALDMAN: Yeah, so this is a ciliate. It's a type of protist, and protists - they're not animals, they're not plants, and they're not fungi. They are their own thing. And you saw it just here. . . ZOMORODI: Oh. WALDMAN: . . . Poop out, like, a little piece of stuff from its stomach. ZOMORODI: It pooped. What? WALDMAN: (Laughter) This is what I love about ciliates. They are called ciliates because they have cilia on their outside, which just means little fringy bits that are like little hairs that they use to get around and feel for food and other things like that. But the thing I love about ciliates is that you can see their entire digestive system. Pretty much, it's just a circle of digestion that you're looking at (laughter). Yeah. ZOMORODI: You know, earlier in the show, we spoke to Emily Levesque. She's an astronomer. And it strikes me that you both have been transported into places that it's kind of hard to believe they exist. Like, without seeing them, you may not believe them. Is that what happened to you with this project? WALDMAN: I feel like it did. I feel that, you know, it's the same as a telescope. It really shows you another world, but I think microscopes even more so because this is the world that you already live in. So instead of showing you this faraway, distant planet and imagining what that is like, you already know what Earth is like. It's just that you don't know that you're walking by entire zoos of tiny animals every day. You know, tardigrades - while they're famous for surviving these extreme environments, they live in moss everywhere across the planet. So every single sidewalk crack that you walk by that has a little piece of moss embedded inside it - there is most likely a lot of tardigrades in there. And this is what I love about microscopes, is really - it gives you much more insight into your experience as a human on earth, which is a pretty amazing planet when you study space. ZOMORODI: And so has that outlook and this experience changed you in some way and where you're headed? WALDMAN: For me, my own journey in microscopes, I think, is really growing. I'm wanting to do more field microscopy in different locations. So whether it be going into prairies or the rainforests of Madagascar, it's very clear that being able to go into the field and look at the microscopic critters that are around and being able to showcase that to the world is something that's really useful because there's just so much that, you know, we enjoy from BBC documentaries of wildlife, and we should have that same experience for the microscopic world around us. And that's really where I'm hoping to take everything. ZOMORODI: That's Ariel Waldman. She's a wildlife filmmaker at the microbial scale. You can see all her microbes at lifeundertheice. org, and you can watch her talk at ted. com. MANOUSH ZOMORODI, HOST:   It's the TED Radio Hour from NPR. I'm Manoush Zomorodi. Today, on the show, we are venturing Through the Looking Glass, extending our perception and exploring strange new worlds, including here on Earth. (SOUNDBITE OF WIND) ARIEL WALDMAN: So when you land on the packed snow runway in McMurdo, yeah, you don't see anything. It's just snow. So there's no trees. There's no bushes. There's no grass. There's none of that. (SOUNDBITE OF WIND) WALDMAN: Most people think of Antarctica as really desolate. You know, it's covered with over a mile of ice in many locations. It's the coldest continent. It's also extremely dry. It's a polar desert. But the thing that I feel like a lot of people don't know about Antarctica is that it's really brimming with life in a lot of different locations. It's just that most of it is invisible to us. You would need to have a microscope in order to see them. ZOMORODI: This is Ariel Waldman. She's a wildlife filmmaker at the microbial scale. WALDMAN: And I'm an adviser to NASA, and I'm also an Antarctic explorer. ZOMORODI: Ariel first became interested in Antarctic microbes back in 2013. She was working with NASA, and she met astrobiologists who study Antarctica's extreme conditions and the life forms that actually thrive there. WALDMAN: I had learned that a lot of biologists go to Antarctica, but they very rarely ever take any photos or videos of the creatures that they study there. And so I kind of saw an opportunity to really help both scientists and help people, you know, around the world actually get to see all this amazing stuff. ZOMORODI: So that realization - that is what inspired you to basically become the first filmmaker to document these hidden ecosystems. But how did you go from that inspiration to making it happen? WALDMAN: Yeah (laughter). ZOMORODI: It couldn't - it could not have been easy. WALDMAN: Going to Antarctica - it just required a lot of preparation. I prepared for months, and this was after it took me five years of applying to go to Antarctica and working towards becoming a wildlife filmmaker at the microbial scale. And so I was self-taught in microscopy. And then I ended up joining the San Francisco Microscopically Society, which I am now the president of (laughter) - super geeky. ZOMORODI: Wow. So you had to become an expert microscopist. Am I saying that right? WALDMAN: Yes, exactly. Exactly. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ZOMORODI: And so do you remember? Like, do you remember what it was like when you first got to put a sample under the microscope in Antarctica and peer into this tiny alien world for the first time? WALDMAN: (Laughter) Yeah, I just about fainted, I feel like. The very first sample I got to look at was from divers who had gone under the sea ice. And I had an idea of, like, a few of the different critters that I was going to see. But when I put the first sample under the microscope, I saw these beautiful diatoms, which are, you know, microalgae with glass shells, which are just beautiful. They're geometric gems of the sea and of different areas of water around the earth. But I found diatoms that had triangular shapes, and they just looked like they had been manufactured by humans. They're so gorgeous. And I - yeah, I don't know. I - it's hard to put it into words just how excited I was. ZOMORODI: OK, so talk us through it. Like, what was the plan for you and your trusty microscopes? WALDMAN: So the plan in Antarctica was to take my microscopes around to different locations and really be able to find life that was under the ice. So I was looking for life underneath the sea ice. I was looking for life embedded inside glacier ice, life that was near frozen lakes. And I would go around, and I would take samples from different locations. And some of the areas where I sampled that were more hardcore to get to, I would join up with another team. ZOMORODI: And one of those hardcore places was beneath the ice, like into the water. WALDMAN: (Laughter) Yeah, it was. . . (SOUNDBITE OF SPLASHING) ZOMORODI: Absolutely freezing water, right? WALDMAN: Yeah, this - absolutely freezing water. I believe the water is negative-2 Celsius. So because it's saltwater, it can go a little bit beyond the normal freezing point of water. And there are divers in Antarctica that regularly go down under 9-feet thick of sea ice and. . . ZOMORODI: Whoa. WALDMAN: . . . Explore the ocean down there. It's really amazing. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) WALDMAN: I was watching these divers, going like, why would anyone want to do that? ZOMORODI: Yeah. WALDMAN: That is freezing cold. Like, there's nothing that can be that worth it. But thankfully, there's this metal tube that McMurdo Station puts into the ice. And you can crawl down this tube. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) WALDMAN: And at the bottom of this tube, you're embedded between the sea ice and the sea floor. So you're kind of floating there, so to speak, with windows where you're able to see all of the life on the sea floor, and you can hear all of these amazing Weddell seals, which sound like synthesizers all around you. It's really magical, and it really changed my perspective on why anyone would ever want to be a diver in Antarctica. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) WALDMAN: So I could help direct divers to take collections from the sea ice ceiling and from the sea floor. And then I would take the samples back to the main laboratory at McMurdo Station and filter them and look at them under the microscope as freshly as I could so that I could see them interacting in the way that they would interact in their home environment. ZOMORODI: So tell us about the microbes that you found and the footage that you took of them. We're actually going to look at them and describe some of them here, and the first one is a tardigrade. Ariel, what is a tardigrade? WALDMAN: (Laughter) So a tardigrade is also known as a water bear or sometimes even a moss piglet. And they are tiny microscopic animals. They are actually animals. They have eight legs. They're incredibly cute. They look like little gummy bears with claws, I always like to say. They've got two little eye spots. Tardigrade means slow walker, so they are not the quickest microbes that you'll see under the microscope, but they're just adorable. And they're famous for being hardcore, for being able to survive extreme cold or extreme dryness, radiation and lots of other things. ZOMORODI: So it looks like to me, OK, yes, a gummy bear. You say gummy bear. I think it also looks like a manatee with eight arms. . . WALDMAN: (Laughter). ZOMORODI: . . . But then see-through and microscopic. And it's just kind of moving around with its little arms. What is it doing? WALDMAN: Yeah, so the little claws on tardigrades are really good at going through moss. So the most common environment that you'll find these tardigrades in is moss. And those claws allow them to be really nimble, but when you put one on a glass slide, it has trouble. It's kind of like an ice skating rink for it. So what you're seeing is a tardigrade which is able to navigate through moss fairly easily, but once it tries walking over the glass, it slips and slides and has trouble getting traction. ZOMORODI: Wow. So much going on for the little tardigrade. OK, so let's take a look at the next one. I'm just going to describe it. It's kind of oblong, translucent with what looks like these little green - I don't know - beach balls kind of moving around inside of it. Oh, and it's moving a bit. It's got a little shimmy. What is happening here, Ariel? Who is this? WALDMAN: Yeah, so this is a ciliate. It's a type of protist, and protists - they're not animals, they're not plants, and they're not fungi. They are their own thing. And you saw it just here. . . ZOMORODI: Oh. WALDMAN: . . . Poop out, like, a little piece of stuff from its stomach. ZOMORODI: It pooped. What? WALDMAN: (Laughter) This is what I love about ciliates. They are called ciliates because they have cilia on their outside, which just means little fringy bits that are like little hairs that they use to get around and feel for food and other things like that. But the thing I love about ciliates is that you can see their entire digestive system. Pretty much, it's just a circle of digestion that you're looking at (laughter). Yeah. ZOMORODI: You know, earlier in the show, we spoke to Emily Levesque. She's an astronomer. And it strikes me that you both have been transported into places that it's kind of hard to believe they exist. Like, without seeing them, you may not believe them. Is that what happened to you with this project? WALDMAN: I feel like it did. I feel that, you know, it's the same as a telescope. It really shows you another world, but I think microscopes even more so because this is the world that you already live in. So instead of showing you this faraway, distant planet and imagining what that is like, you already know what Earth is like. It's just that you don't know that you're walking by entire zoos of tiny animals every day. You know, tardigrades - while they're famous for surviving these extreme environments, they live in moss everywhere across the planet. So every single sidewalk crack that you walk by that has a little piece of moss embedded inside it - there is most likely a lot of tardigrades in there.

I'm Manoush Zomorodi. And I want to start the show on a mountaintop in Chile, 8,000 feet above sea level at Las Campanas Observatory. OSCAR DUHALDE: Yes, Las Campanas is in the northern part of Chile in what we call the Norte Chico, the small north. ZOMORODI: This is Oscar Duhalde. He's an instrument and operations specialist. And before that, he was a telescope operator there. DUHALDE: As telescope operator, I was in charge to guide the telescope during the night. ZOMORODI: On February 24, 1987, Oscar was working his usual shift, guiding the telescope by hand, which he says is exhausting. DUHALDE: And we start to observe by about 22 hours, 21:30, 22 hours. And by 2 a. m. , I say it's enough. I decide to have a coffee at this time. ZOMORODI: So he gets his coffee and heads outside for a break. DUHALDE: In all the sky, especially in the South, you see a lot of stars, especially here in Chile. The sky was beautiful - you know, the summer sky in Las Campanas. ZOMORODI: And high above, Oscar sees our neighboring galaxy, the Large Magellanic Cloud. He had spent the previous few years taking detailed images of this galaxy. DUHALDE: For that reason, I recognized very well that part of the sky. And around the LMC, the Large Magellanic Cloud, there is only one bright star. And I use that star always for focus the telescope. ZOMORODI: But when Oscar looks up this time, something is different. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)DUHALDE: Immediately, I recognize a new star there that I was sure wasn't there before (laughter). ZOMORODI: A new star. So Oscar tells Barry Madore, one of the astronomers, about it and then realizes it actually may be a supernova - an exploding star. DUHALDE: Barry look at me and say, Oscar, a supernova at the LMC? I said, well, it's difficult but not impossible. ZOMORODI: So you actually spotted a supernova just by looking up into the sky - no telescope? DUHALDE: (Laughter) Well, at that time, I didn't realize how powerful my eye was. It's not easy to recognize a new star in any place of the sky. And in that moment, the excitement start. I say, well, we did it (laughter). ZOMORODI: Oscar became the only living person on the planet to discover a supernova with the naked eye, our oldest tool for peering into the universe. EMILY LEVESQUE: For millennia, people have been studying the stars with the naked eye. And it's really astonishing to look at what people were able to discover and what people were able to learn just through stargazing. ZOMORODI: This is Emily Levesque. She's an astrophysicist, and she writes about the history of astronomy. LEVESQUE: Ironically, the first instances of sort of using telescopes for astronomy began just a few years after the last naked-eye supernova. There was a naked-eye supernova in 1604. And just a few years after that, we started using telescopes to study the universe. And then it was 300-odd years later, in 1987, when Oscar Duhalde saw another naked-eye supernova. And now we had these beautiful modern telescopes at our disposal to try and study it. So you can see why that would have been such an exciting discovery when it happened. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ZOMORODI: Our senses can only take us so far in understanding the world around us. But with the right tools, we can look further, see deeper and push past those limits. We can venture into uncharted territory. . . LEVESQUE: Are we alone in the universe? ZOMORODI: . . . And ask questions we didn't even know we had. LEVESQUE: Where did we come from? Where is the universe going? What is our place in it? ZOMORODI: Because sometimes big discoveries only happen if we're willing to fall down the rabbit hole. ARIEL WALDMAN: I just about fainted (laughter) I feel like. CHARLIE JANE ANDERS: Give us something to reach for. . . RICK DOBLIN: I think we could talk about the human mind, the unconscious as the final frontier. ANDERS: . . . And something to dream of. ZOMORODI: So today, on the show, we're traveling Through the Looking Glass to explore strange new worlds using telescopes, microscopes and even our unconscious minds. But first, back to Emily Levesque. She says that long before Oscar Duhalde spotted the supernova with his naked eye, astronomers were using something almost as primitive to make sense of the sky - small plates of glass. LEVESQUE: Astronomers were using these very delicate glass plates to capture images from telescopes. The plates were chemically treated so they would respond to light. And then when you loaded one of these plates into a telescope's camera and opened the shutter, you would get this exquisite little black-and-white image of whatever the telescope was pointed at. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ZOMORODI: Needless to say, these fragile pieces of glass were pretty hard to work with. LEVESQUE: Astronomers would mess with the chemical treatment that dictated how the plates responded to light. They would slice them down to size to fit into the cameras. They would do all this work in the dark because once you expose a plate to light, it starts to darken. ZOMORODI: But scientists made huge discoveries with these glass plates, including one in 1923 by someone you may have heard of before - Edwin Hubble. LEVESQUE: Most people know the name Hubble because of our wonderful space telescope that we have right now. But Edwin Hubble was an astronomer in the first half of the 20th century, and one of his biggest discoveries was that there are other galaxies beyond our own. Early in his career, sort of early in Hubble's time, we thought that our galaxy, the Milky Way, was possibly the whole universe. And Hubble got observations of one of our neighboring galaxies, the Andromeda Galaxy, with glass plates. At the time, Andromeda was referred to as the great Andromeda Nebula, and people weren't quite sure what it was. And Hubble's observations with glass plates meant that he was able to estimate the distance to Andromeda and demonstrate that it must be incredibly far away. It had to be another galaxy. ZOMORODI: So Hubble made this discovery almost 100 years ago. But the images that we have of Andromeda today, they are so different. They are so detailed compared to when we had to use those glass plates, right? LEVESQUE: Yeah. So if you Google it, you can actually probably find a picture of the glass plate that Hubble used to make his discovery. And if you look at that plate, you can see these sort of wisps of spiral arms and this hint of what we know today looks like a galaxy. But if you just look up a big, modern photograph of Andromeda, you'll probably see observations with the Hubble Space Telescope, so a very different type of Hubble observation. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LEVESQUE: And nowadays, we can pinpoint and study individual stars in Andromeda down to really exquisite detail. We can study very dim stars in the galaxy. We can watch how the stars move. It's really just amazing how much detail we can now achieve with the observing tools that we have available to us today. ZOMORODI: Here's Emily Levesque on the TED stage showing a photo of the Vera Rubin Observatory in Chile. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)LEVESQUE: This telescope will photograph the entire southern sky every few days over and over, following a preset pattern for 10 years. Computers and algorithms affiliated with the observatory will then compare every pair of images taken of the same patch of sky, looking for anything that's gotten brighter or dimmer, like a variable star, or looking for anything that's appeared, like a supernova. Right now, we discover about a thousand supernovae every year. The Rubin Observatory will be capable of discovering a thousand supernovae every night. It's going to dramatically change the face of astronomy and of how we study things that change in the sky, and it will do all of this largely without much human intervention at all. It will follow that preset pattern and computationally find anything that's changed or appeared. ZOMORODI: So it sounds like telescopes today almost remove all of the human aspects of stargazing. But Oscar Duhalde used the most basic tool available - his eyes. Is there still room for spontaneous observation in astronomy? LEVESQUE: Yeah, so we think of the story of Oscar discovering a supernova with the naked eye as this very unusual one-off. And it was. He was the only living person on the planet to discover a supernova with the naked eye in hundreds of years. But naked-eye astronomy can still sometimes be kind of cool. And the best recent example of this is actually something that happened about a year and a half ago to the star Betelgeuse. So a lot of people know Betelgeuse. It's the bright red star in one of the shoulders of the constellation Orion. And in the fall of 2019, Betelgeuse started to get dramatically dimmer to the point where you could notice it with your naked eye. And amateur astronomers and small telescope users were the ones who started spotting this. So my colleagues and I were able to, really, on short notice, snatch these brief moments of time on telescopes to try and point to Betelgeuse while it was this dim to try and figure out what was going on. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)LEVESQUE: I have a lot of people ask me, you know, how do I get into stargazing? How do I get into astronomy? And there's sometimes an assumption that you have to run out and buy an expensive telescope. But you can enjoy astronomy with just your eyes and just enjoy how beautiful the sky looks and try to look for patterns and look for unusual things. If you have a pair of binoculars, you can get just amazing views of things like the moon. So it's a really wonderful pursuit, even if all you're just doing is looking up and enjoying how beautiful it is. ZOMORODI: So I have to ask, Emily, I mean - and this is a full confession here - I get kind of freaked out when I spend any time doing astronomy. I think the existential nature of trying to peer into the universe, like, it kind of messes with my head, to be honest. How do you deal with that? LEVESQUE: It's funny because I've heard several people talk about space and the universe as being scary and the scale of it as just being stunning. And I think it's something that a lot of astronomers never really forget but that we get used to or that we put aside. And I talked about Betelgeuse and the fact that it had suddenly dimmed. And something that we tucked to the back of our minds was that Betelgeuse is 645 light years away. The light that we were studying from Betelgeuse had left that star 645 years earlier. And whenever you observe an object in the night sky, you're kind of looking back in time. It's like jumping into a tiny time machine. But once in a while, someone would ask me, you know, do you think Betelgeuse has already died as a supernova? ZOMORODI: Oh, right. LEVESQUE: Do you think the star's already gone and the light from that supernova just isn't going to get here for another 100 or 200 or 600 years? And I always think, you know, maybe it did, but we won't know for a few hundred years, so let's work at what we have. And that's just an astonishing scale to be working on and dealing with as part of your day-to-day job. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ZOMORODI: That's Emily Levesque.

He was the only living person on the planet to discover a supernova with the naked eye in hundreds of years. But naked-eye astronomy can still sometimes be kind of cool. And the best recent example of this is actually something that happened about a year and a half ago to the star Betelgeuse. So a lot of people know Betelgeuse. It's the bright red star in one of the shoulders of the constellation Orion. And in the fall of 2019, Betelgeuse started to get dramatically dimmer to the point where you could notice it with your naked eye. And amateur astronomers and small telescope users were the ones who started spotting this. So my colleagues and I were able to, really, on short notice, snatch these brief moments of time on telescopes to try and point to Betelgeuse while it was this dim to try and figure out what was going on. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) LEVESQUE: I have a lot of people ask me, you know, how do I get into stargazing? How do I get into astronomy? And there's sometimes an assumption that you have to run out and buy an expensive telescope. But you can enjoy astronomy with just your eyes and just enjoy how beautiful the sky looks and try to look for patterns and look for unusual things. If you have a pair of binoculars, you can get just amazing views of things like the moon. So it's a really wonderful pursuit, even if all you're just doing is looking up and enjoying how beautiful it is. ZOMORODI: So I have to ask, Emily, I mean - and this is a full confession here - I get kind of freaked out when I spend any time doing astronomy. I think the existential nature of trying to peer into the universe, like, it kind of messes with my head, to be honest. How do you deal with that? LEVESQUE: It's funny because I've heard several people talk about space and the universe as being scary and the scale of it as just being stunning. And I think it's something that a lot of astronomers never really forget but that we get used to or that we put aside. And I talked about Betelgeuse and the fact that it had suddenly dimmed. And something that we tucked to the back of our minds was that Betelgeuse is 645 light years away. The light that we were studying from Betelgeuse had left that star 645 years earlier. And whenever you observe an object in the night sky, you're kind of looking back in time. It's like jumping into a tiny time machine. But once in a while, someone would ask me, you know, do you think Betelgeuse has already died as a supernova? ZOMORODI: Oh, right. LEVESQUE: Do you think the star's already gone and the light from that supernova just isn't going to get here for another 100 or 200 or 600 years? And I always think, you know, maybe it did, but we won't know for a few hundred years, so let's work at what we have. And that's just an astonishing scale to be working on and dealing with as part of your day-to-day job. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ZOMORODI: That's Emily Levesque.

Right away, they made a huge discovery. It looked like the virus jumped to humans from bats. Now scientists are worried that another animal coronavirus will strike again, so they've gone hunting for other potential sources, and the news is not good. NPR's Michaeleen Doucleff reports. MICHAELEEN DOUCLEFF, BYLINE: One of the virus hunters is Edward Holmes at The University of Sydney. This past year, he and colleagues trapped several hundred bats in a tiny section of Yunnan province, China, an area about the size of Los Angeles Airport. Then they looked for viruses inside the animals. EDWARD HOLMES: So in this very small area we sampled, like a thousand hectares, an amazing number of new bat viruses. DOUCLEFF: In terms of coronaviruses alone, these bats carry 24 new ones, including four closely related to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. On top of that, Holmes says these bats are flying all across Southeast Asia. HOLMES: So you can just imagine if you apply that to the whole of Southeast Asia, what the amazing diversity of these viruses are. And it's just an enormous number of them. DOUCLEFF: In fact, Holmes says, that if you look all around the world, there are likely thousands of undetected coronaviruses out there, coronaviruses that are different than SARS-CoV-2. HOLMES: And we're only just starting to scratch the surface of that, and the virusphere of coronavirus is just immense. DOUCLEFF: And the viruses aren't just in bats. They're in many, many animals - dogs, cats, birds, chickens, pigs, rodents in people's homes. HOLMES: So under our feet, there is coronaviruses. Above our head in bats, there are coronaviruses. We live almost in a kind of coronavirus world. DOUCLEFF: And the big question now is how often do these viruses jump from animals into people? Peter Daszak is a disease ecologist at EcoHealth Alliance and an investigator for the World Health Organization. Back in 2003, he and his team tried to answer that question in communities in southern China. They drew blood from about 400 people and looked for signs of previous coronavirus infections. PETER DASZAK: In one place, we got 2. 8% positive, which is pretty high. DOUCLEFF: That means, at the time, 3 out of every 100 people there had been infected with an unknown coronavirus. DASZAK: So if you do the math on that and multiply it up, given the total population in Southeast Asia where the bats are that carry these viruses and just the rural population, the ones that are highly exposed, you're looking at over a million people a year getting infected. DOUCLEFF: In other words, different coronaviruses are constantly jumping from bats and other animals into people. Scientists call this spillover. DASZAK: It's happening every day. I mean, I look at the spillover event as it's a little bit like rain or snow, you know, with a nice winter snow this year. And it's a bit like snowflakes falling. These viruses are getting into our populations, trickling across. DOUCLEFF: The vast majority of these spillover events do very little. But each one gives the virus the opportunity to adapt and spread more easily from person to person. And every once in a while, that contagious virus infects a person who finds their way into a city. And so both Daszak and Edward Holmes agree - the next coronavirus outbreak, even the next pandemic, could be right around the corner. HOLMES: I hate to disturb listeners, but this is not a once-in-100-year event. It could be any time. DOUCLEFF: It could even be next year. Michaeleen Doucleff, NPR News.

S. property at risk. How communities will pay to address that is a huge question. NPR's Nathan Rott has the story of a proposal in California that may offer an option by buying and then renting out coastal properties. (SOUNDBITE OF WAVES CRASHING)NATHAN ROTT, BYLINE: On a normal day at a normal tide on the Southern California coast, knee-high waves glide over a narrow strip of gold sand - ocean on one side, raised houses the other. No. Mansions might be a better descriptor. BEN ALLEN: I don't know. We should Zillow, shouldn't we? Let's see. It'll be interesting. ROTT: Ben Allen pulls out his cell phone and opens up the surprising. ALLEN: Yeah. These are pricey. ROTT: Allen is a state legislator. He represents a coastal district a bit south of where we are now. And he's not kidding about the price - 6. 3 million, 3. 1. . . ALLEN: Eight point three. ROTT: Eight point three million? ALLEN: Yeah. Let's go look at that one. ROTT: Now, not all coastal properties are million-dollar mansions, but Zillow estimates that by 2050, more than $40 billion in California real estate will be at risk from sea level rise. And when you have that much value at stake, Allen says, government has to do something about it. They can use taxpayer money to try and defend property - building seawalls, dredging sand - or they can use taxpayer money to try to reduce the amount of property that's at risk by buying people out of their coastal homes. Neither of which is cheap, which is where Allen comes in. He pulls up the Zillow profile for that $8 million house. ALLEN: Yeah. So the rent estimate is that it would be $12,500 a month. ROTT: Money that Allen wants to put to use. He's proposed legislation that would allow California communities to buy at-risk property along the coast with the goal of then renting those beachfront properties out, either to the original homeowner or through something like Airbnb to recoup over time the upfront cost. ALLEN: This is a way of taking advantage of the value of these properties and the rental value over the next couple decades. ROTT: Before it's gone. ALLEN: Before it's gone. ROTT: The federal government, states and even some nonprofits have been funding buyouts around the country for years, mostly in the flood-prone east. But those programs have limitations. Miyuki Hino studies buyouts at the University of North Carolina. MIYUKI HINO: One of the lessons that's come through really clearly from research on retreat in the U. S. is that our tools right now for doing it are so rigid and so inflexible that they really only work for a very narrow subset of the population. ROTT: Your house likely has to have just been flooded, she says. It has to be valuable enough to be bought out, but not so valuable that it's too expensive. It helps if you speak English, she says. And you have to be willing to deal with years of bureaucracy. So, yeah, it doesn't work well. Meanwhile, homeowners are being incentivized to stay in their homes. Take any beachside property, says Andy Keeler, an economist at East Carolina University. ANDY KEELER: The value of the house is hugely a function of what the public sector does. ROTT: That's why there's a lot of political pressure to use taxpayer money to build seawalls and nourish beaches with imported sand. Keeler calls this a positive feedback loop. KEELER: You nourish the beach, right? And once you nourish the beach, property owners have a new view of what risk is, and they reinvest in property. Once they reinvest in property, you have more wealth and real estate. And so you have more of a reason to then, six years later, keep investing. ROTT: It's a runaway train, Keeler says - more sand gets dumped, seawalls get higher, property values stay high until seawater is spraying over the wall. From an economics perspective, Keeler says, defending property doesn't always add up. It just means spending money now and later and later again until the property is underwater and worth nothing. That's why Keeler has been advocating for more places to look at buy-to-rent strategies similar to the one that's been proposed in California. KEELER: This can break the positive feedback loop. If these homeowners can sell their houses and still have the ability to rent them back for a time, or they can produce income by renting to other people, then you've broken that link. ROTT: Likely saving the public money down the road. JULIA STEIN: That's a really interesting and novel approach, so there's very little to compare it to. ROTT: Julia Stein works on climate issues at the University of California, Los Angeles, and she helped Ben Allen draft the proposed legislation. She thinks there are still a lot of questions about how exactly it would play out if this bill passed. Who would manage the rental properties? Would homeowners even choose to participate? Is spending taxpayer money on $8 million homes the best use when we know that that property's value is likely going to decrease in the future? Stein says there's a lot of research showing that real estate values now do a poor job accounting for climate change. STEIN: But at some point, the market is going to realize the problem. And at that point, it may be too late. ROTT: All the more reason, she says, to try and get ahead now. Nathan Rott, NPR News.

That can make pregnancy difficult in a normal year, and the pandemic has only made it more complicated. Claire Stremple from member station KTOO in Juneau reports on one woman who spent months far away from home to keep her community safe. CLAIRE STREMPLE, BYLINE: St. Paul Island is in the middle of the Bering Sea, 800 miles from the nearest hospital. There is a clinic on the island, so most prenatal appointments happen there. Pregnant people usually visit Anchorage only a few times before they move to the city about a month before their due date. CARA LESTENKOF-MANDREGAN: That's typically what's done here. But that's not the story that I have. STREMPLE: Cara Lestenkof-Mandregan is part of the Indigenous Unangan community that lives on the island. She and her boyfriend found out she was pregnant with twins. LESTENKOF-MANDREGAN: And I had the doctor come in and tell me all these things that could potentially go wrong. STREMPLE: Pregnant women are already at higher risk for serious illness due to COVID-19. And the doctor told her twins are also considered a high-risk pregnancy. LESTENKOF-MANDREGAN: And that after 16 weeks, I would need to travel out to Anchorage every two weeks for appointments. My jaw dropped.

She didn't want to get sick or be the one who brought COVID-19 back from the city. Eventually, doctors at Alaska Native Medical Center advised that she stay in Anchorage.

MATT HIRSCHFELD: We really need to start working on how do we support these moms as best we can? Because they're not delivering near their families. STREMPLE: Pediatrician Matt Hirschfeld leads maternal child health services at Alaska Native Medical Center. HIRSCHFELD: They're not delivering with their aunties and grandmas and, you know, everybody around them. STREMPLE: That separation from home and family is hard.

HIRSCHFELD: Back in the '80s and before, Alaska had one of the highest neonatal mortality rates, which is defined as kids who die before the first 30 days, in the country. STREMPLE: Hirschfeld says the transition to hospital births correlates to a 75% drop in infant mortality over the last few decades. Hospital housing does have communal kitchens and play areas for families to gather when they're away from home, but COVID-19 shut all that down. The pandemic has put a spotlight on the hardships of separation and isolation during pregnancy. LESTENKOF-MANDREGAN: Kind of just a blur, but we were there for a long time. STREMPLE: For months, Cara Lestenkof-Mandregan and her boyfriend only left their small room for medical appointments. She says she was grateful her partner was there. Many women make the trip alone.

For NPR News, I'm Claire Stremple. (SOUNDBITE OF EPIGRAM'S \"THE STRANGERS WE ARE BECOMING\") RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:   There aren't a lot of maternity wards in the remote towns of Alaska, including the state's Native villages. That can make pregnancy difficult in a normal year, and the pandemic has only made it more complicated. Claire Stremple from member station KTOO in Juneau reports on one woman who spent months far away from home to keep her community safe. CLAIRE STREMPLE, BYLINE: St. Paul Island is in the middle of the Bering Sea, 800 miles from the nearest hospital. There is a clinic on the island, so most prenatal appointments happen there. Pregnant people usually visit Anchorage only a few times before they move to the city about a month before their due date. CARA LESTENKOF-MANDREGAN: That's typically what's done here. But that's not the story that I have. STREMPLE: Cara Lestenkof-Mandregan is part of the Indigenous Unangan community that lives on the island. She and her boyfriend found out she was pregnant with twins. LESTENKOF-MANDREGAN: And I had the doctor come in and tell me all these things that could potentially go wrong. STREMPLE: Pregnant women are already at higher risk for serious illness due to COVID-19. And the doctor told her twins are also considered a high-risk pregnancy. LESTENKOF-MANDREGAN: And that after 16 weeks, I would need to travel out to Anchorage every two weeks for appointments. My jaw dropped. STREMPLE: Her island stayed safe while case counts began to rise in Anchorage, where she was traveling for checkups. But that travel started to feel like a gamble.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)SARA HOSSAINI, BYLINE: The project is a radio show called. . . HENRY SALES: Radio or Radio B'alam. HOSSAINI: Twenty-seven-year-old founder Henry Sales says the show is reaching out to thousands of Mayan Guatemalans in the Bay Area who speak a language called Mam. The name translates to Radio Jaguar, a historical reference to the Mam king, who led his people up a mountain to escape the Spanish invaders. So do you feel like you're trying to save your people? SALES: Yeah. Hopefully, that's what we're going to do. We're trying to, you know, save, you know, some people and, you know, guide them to the right direction. HOSSAINI: Over the past 40 years, a community of an estimated 18,000 Mayan Mam speakers fleeing violence and poverty in Guatemala has formed in Oakland's Fruitvale neighborhood. Now they face yet another threat, says Sales, the pandemic. SALES: I remember there were many of them telling me that, I don't care about COVID because I will end up in the street. You got to work. There's no benefit, like, you know, if you work in construction. So that's why many of them got sick. HOSSAINI: A testing event in Oakland in the fall showed that more than a quarter of Mam tested already had the coronavirus, the largest proportion of any ethnic group by far. But many Mam don't speak English or Spanish. And a significant number don't read, which has made it harder to access public health information. So Sales came up with the idea of speaking to them directly through audio streaming. By mid-December, Sales had a radio booth in the middle of an active food pantry. SALES: So this is the space. And they're going to move over, so we have, like, extra space. HOSSAINI: And this food pantry is run by a local nonprofit called Homies Empowerment. The group decided to offer Radio B'alam the space after figuring out that most of the people who came were Mam, and there was a communication barrier. Juan Dominguez runs the site.

Khamari is one of a growing number of scientists across the world who make agar art, and he joins us now from Puttaparthi, India. Welcome to the program. BALARAM KHAMARI: Thank you. Thank you. My pleasure. MCCAMMON: So first, I've seen some of these images online, and they're incredibly cool, very, very pretty. But since this is radio, can you just describe for us what this looks like? KHAMARI: The image for which I got an award from the American Society of Microbiology, the name of the piece is \"Microbial Peacock. \"MCCAMMON: This is a peacock, for our listeners who can't see it, surrounded by feathers. KHAMARI: Yes, it is an art piece, which is made with living bacteria. The bacteria grow on their growth medium in such a way that they look like an art. MCCAMMON: And you're using agar, as we mentioned. Is this the same stuff that some of us might have in our kitchens, like the vegetarian gelatin, essentially? KHAMARI: Yes. Yes. But in this case, the agar-agar powder that we use is even more purified version. And it is not only agar-agar. With agar-agar, we add other substances like salt and other nutrients like beef extract, yeast extract to make it rich in nutrients for the bacterium to grow. So agar-agar is solidifying. It gives us a jelly-like substance to work with so that on the surface we can draw the bacteria, put the bacteria and let it grow. MCCAMMON: And what kinds of bacteria are you using in this process? KHAMARI: We do have a connection with the hospitals here. So I - and my research work involves working with pathogenic bacteria isolated from human hosts. The bacteria which I commonly work with are Escherichia coli, which is a very common bacteria which happens to be there inside our intestines. And another one which I use very frequently is Staphylococcus aureus. That's also a bacterium which is very common in humans. MCCAMMON: Is that, like, a Staph infection, that bacteria? KHAMARI: Yes, Staphylococcus aureus also causes infection. Yes. MCCAMMON: You're making art out of bacteria that grows in our intestines that's potentially very infectious. Is this dangerous? KHAMARI: Yes. Unless - if you are working in the lab with proper protection and in the biosafety cabinets, it is always safe. Since I happen to be a microbiologist and I know how to handle bacteria, it is good. I can do it on my own without any danger to myself, but I wouldn't recommend anybody to try it at home or anywhere where there is not much protection. MCCAMMON: And what kinds of, like, colors and shapes are possible with this technique? KHAMARI: Yeah, it depends on what kind of microbes you can use and you are allowed to use. For example, in my lab, we work on living bacteria. So with bacteria, you may not get so much of depth as such, but when they use fungi for the work, you can get that, and you can get 3D structures also. MCCAMMON: You know, I think there's this idea that art and science are sort of opposites or even opposed. You know, people say something's a science but not an art. Do you see a tension there between art and science? KHAMARI: I always think that they are interlinked. Even doing a science experiment requires art. Similarly, in art, I think we create very big structures here. Like, we make floors (ph), and we make huge structures and huge sets for dramas and movies also. There, I could make out that it takes science. It takes science to understand the working of the structures and to design the architecture of the structures. And even when you're doing very small art, I think it is - a little bit of scientific mind is required. So I always thought that these two go hand in hand.

SHAPIRO: Colin Kennedy is a physicist at the Boulder Atomic Clock Optical Network Collaboration. KENNEDY: And I build some of the world's best atomic clocks. AILSA CHANG, HOST:  And whereas a grandfather clock needs to be reset every so often, Kennedy's colleague Jun Ye says atomic clocks can be much more accurate. JUN YE: This is a clock where, if you set it right at the beginning of the universe, it would still be ticking, right? You know, it maybe have been one second too slow or too fast. CHANG: In other words, the world's best atomic clocks would only be a second off after ticking for more than 13 billion years. SHAPIRO: On top of their accuracy, atomic clocks don't look much like grandfather clocks, either. KENNEDY: There's a whole mess of wires and laser beams. SHAPIRO: The clocks work by tapping into the natural oscillation of atoms, and different atoms tick at different speeds. The worldwide standard clock today is based on cesium atoms, which tick about 9 billion times per second. CHANG: But a new generation of clocks tick much faster than that, meaning you can divide a second into tinier and tinier slices. That makes the new atomic clocks 100 times more accurate than the cesium clock. KENNEDY: Ultimately, the goal is to redefine the second in terms of a more accurate and more precise standard. SHAPIRO: Kennedy, Ye and their colleagues compared three of those next-generation atomic clocks, which use atoms of aluminum, strontium or ytterbium. CHANG: The goal was not to see which atomic clock was the best ticker per se but to show that these types of clocks can be compared from one lab to another, perhaps from one country to another. KENNEDY: We want to make sure that a clock built here in Boulder is the same as a clock built in Paris as in London as in Tokyo. SHAPIRO: So to connect their clocks housed in separate parts of Boulder, Colo. , the scientists did something almost straight out of a comic book. They shot a laser beam through the air across town between two laboratory buildings. Here's Ye again. YE: It was a fun experiment for sure. And it's - by all measure, it's actually very safe. And it's very much sort of out of the way of people's daily life. SHAPIRO: He assured us the laser was high above Boulder and that no birds were hurt that he knows of. The findings appear in the journal Nature. CHANG: Ye says networks of clocks like this could be used as super-sensitive sensors to detect a passing wave of dark matter. And the work moves scientists one step closer to officially redefining the second with a new type of clock. SHAPIRO: As for our day-to-day lives, well, no need to reset your watch. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:   Scientists are one step closer to redefining the length of a second. To do that, they are using atomic clocks.

Well, at least some of the time. It's a trait that has helped us succeed as a species. Now scientists are trying to understand how niceness evolved. Just before the pandemic, NPR's Jon Hamilton visited the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and he reports now on what researchers are learning from some peace-loving apes there. JON HAMILTON, BYLINE: A few miles outside of Kinshasa, along the banks of the Lukaya River, is a sanctuary for bonobo. It's called Lola ya Bonobo, and about 60 of the animals live here. They look like smallish chimpanzees, and they spend most of their day in the forest. . . (SOUNDBITE OF BONOBOS SCREECHING)HAMILTON: . . . Until it's time to eat. Bernard Nsangu is a caretaker here at Lola ya Bonobo, which means bonobo paradise. BERNARD NSANGU: (Non-English language spoken). HAMILTON: He says the bonobos understand just about everything he says in French or Lingala. And right now, they're passing along the news that pineapple is coming. Soon, more than a dozen bonobos have assembled near the edge of their enclosure. (SOUNDBITE OF BONOBOS SCREECHING)HAMILTON: With chimps and many other species, food can lead to aggression. But Suzy Kwetuenda, a biologist at Lola, says bonobos take a different approach. SUZY KWETUENDA: You see, there is many, many action of sex, many negotiation around, that make peace. HAMILTON: Bonobos, along with chimps, are our closest living relatives. And you can see aspects of our own behavior in both species. Chimps tend to rely on cunning and competition. Bonobos emphasize cooperation and sharing. Dr. Jonas Mukamba, the head veterinarian here, says bonobos also have an unusual approach to leadership. JONAS MUKAMBA: (Non-English language spoken). HAMILTON: \"Here in the bonobos' home,\" he says, \"it is the females who dominate, and it is a female who is chief of the group. \" Suzy Kwetuenda says that's one reason the meal we're watching is so peaceful. She points to an alpha female. KWETUENDA: This is Samandua - big mom, tough mom. And as you can see, she's in the front. She has to show that she's very concerned by all organization in the group. (SOUNDBITE OF BONOBO SCREECHING)HAMILTON: Bonobos are unusual in their willingness to share, something that was documented in a series of experiments here at Lola. The research was done by Brian Hare of Duke University and Suzy Kwetuenda. KWETUENDA: So I want to show you. So this is normally the lab. As you see, it's very large, and we have many rooms. HAMILTON: Kwetuenda says in one experiment, they put two bonobos in adjacent rooms. Then they gave one of the animals some really special food. KWETUENDA: It must be the favorite food, like apples. They love bananas. And most of times, we were normally trying to put bonobo sauce - I remember it was the milk, cream. HAMILTON: The bonobo with food could choose to eat alone or use a key to let in their neighbor. KWETUENDA: In our mind, we thought that because of nice food, they would first eat, but we are surprised to see that roommate is more important than food - than favorite food. HAMILTON: The scientists repeated the experiment with three bonobos, one of whom was a stranger. KWETUENDA: We also found that bonobos share with anyone, but they prefer to share with a stranger than a roommate. HAMILTON: And in yet another experiment, scientists showed that bonobos are willing to help one another obtain food, even if they know they won't get to share it. This sort of behavior may seem odd from an evolutionary perspective, but there's evidence that large-scale cooperation is what helped Homo sapiens outlast other early humans. And it's allowed our species to share new ideas, create vast nations and explore other planets. (SOUNDBITE OF CRICKETS CHIRPING)HAMILTON: Scientists have published more than 75 studies from research done at Lola ya Bonobo. The DRC is the only place on Earth where these animals still live in the wild, and this sanctuary provides a place to study their behavior in a naturalistic setting. Claudine Andre, who founded the sanctuary nearly 30 years ago, says the scientific studies have documented what she sees every day - sharing, cooperation and empathy. CLAUDINE ANDRE: They are full of empathy, this animal, and full of love also. And all their life is based on relation between the other one. HAMILTON: A sampling of bonobo science suggests Andre is right. Studies show that if one bonobo yawns, others will yawn too - a behavior closely associated with empathy. They also show that bonobos understand when someone is trying to help them. If a scientist hides a treat under one of two upside down cups, bonobos will look to the scientists for a gesture indicating which cup to choose. Chimps, for all their cleverness, just keep choosing a cup at random. Andre says bonobos also communicate through eye contact much the way people do. ANDRE: If you look to a chimpanzee, every three seconds, it turns its eyes. A bonobo - he wants to know, who are you? What is the connection we can have? HAMILTON: Studies even show that bonobo brains include special circuits for social interaction that are not found in chimpanzees. The result is an animal predisposed to sharing, tolerance, negotiation and cooperation. Andre says those are all traits she sees in humans on a good day. ANDRE: Human can be a fantastic bonobo with a big heart, help people and so, or very dangerous warriors. We are mixed. HAMILTON: It's been about 6 million years since the death of our last common ancestor with chimps and bonobos. Since then, we humans have channeled our inner bonobo to share and cooperate on a massive scale. But we've acted more like chimps when it comes to behaviors like violence against members of our own species. Humans do not consider every stranger a potential friend. Studies show we may not even consider a stranger fully human if they belong to a group perceived as other and threatening. Scientists say when that happens, we tend to suppress empathy and embrace cruelty. (SOUNDBITE OF BONOBO SCREECHING)HAMILTON: Yvonne Vela Tona, better known as Mama Yvonne, sits on the steps of a terrace overlooking the Lukaya River. An orphaned bonobo infant named Esake is climbing on her head and shoulders, looking for snacks and occasionally trying to grab the microphone I'm holding. (SOUNDBITE OF BONOBOS SCREECHING)HAMILTON: Mama Yvonne has been a mother to a couple of human children and surrogate mother to more than 20 bonobos. And like Claudine Andre, she's seen both the chimp and bonobo sides of human behavior. Mama Yvonne left Angola more than 20 years ago to escape a civil war that left 500,000 people dead. Since then, she's lived in a nation where armed conflicts have killed millions. She says her time at Lola ya Bonobo has made her think about her own species. YVONNE VELA TONA: (Non-English language spoken). HAMILTON: \"What people can learn from bonobos,\" she says, \"is that war and violence are not inevitable. We have within us the capacity to resolve conflicts through other means. \"Jon Hamilton, NPR News. (SOUNDBITE OF BONOBO'S \"CIRRUS\") AILSA CHANG, HOST:   Humans evolved to be nice.

They've exploded in numbers off the Northern California coast. And these purple, spiky urchins are wiping out crucial kelp forests. So scientists are now searching for ways to slow them down. Here's NPR's Lauren Sommer. LAUREN SOMMER, BYLINE: Diving in a kelp forest is a lot like walking through a real forest. The seaweed is 30 to 60 feet tall. MEREDITH MCPHERSON: It's very surreal. You're kind of swimming around, and then you have this large canopy over you that's kind of filtering light. SOMMER: At least that's how it used to be, says Meredith McPherson, a graduate student at UC Santa Cruz. She and her colleagues found that 95% of kelp forests have disappeared in counties north of San Francisco. Kelp provides a key habitat for all kinds of marine life. MCPHERSON: We were expecting something like that, but it doesn't really make it any easier to digest in terms of the actual loss of the coastal ecosystem. SOMMER: It happened because of an ecological double whammy. First came a marine heatwave known as the blob. Water temperatures rose far above normal. Then came a more direct attack from purple sea urchins. MCPHERSON: They are voracious grazers. SOMMER: They devour kelp. MCPHERSON: Sometimes we see dozens of them crawling up the stem of the kelp and kind of taking it down from there. SOMMER: Normally, urchins are kept in check by their main predator off Northern California, a giant starfish, or sea star, as scientists call them, known as the sunflower sea star. But they've been wiped out by sea star wasting disease. Scientists think that both the disease and the blob of warm water were made worse by climate change. Even now, with most of the kelp off Northern California gone, the urchins are still everywhere. MORGAN MURPHY-CANNELLA: They're kind of like zombies. You know, they can last for a long time without eating, and they just live. SOMMER: Morgan Murphy-Cannella is kelp restoration coordinator with Reef Check California, a group of citizen scientist divers. She's leading an effort to help beat back the urchins on a small section of coast where divers are systematically removing them. MURPHY-CANNELLA: And they clear by hand. Some guys have, like, rakes attached to their hands, kind of like Wolverine from \"X-Men. \"SOMMER: Last year, they removed more than 20,000 pounds of purple urchins. The idea is to give kelp seedlings a chance to grow, at least in one spot. MURPHY-CANNELLA: I think that we can do this. It's going to have to be a long-term project, but I think we can create these oasis zones where we can see kelp grow back.

SOMMER: On a corner in San Francisco, Stephanie Mutz puts four purple urchins into a bag for a customer. She runs Sea Stephanie Fish, based in Santa Barbara. These customers are after the urchin's uni, its coveted reproductive part. MUTZ: I mean, they're just so good. SOMMER: As a diver, Mutz watched these purple urchins boom. They're easy to catch, but without a lot of kelp to eat, they don't have much uni inside. MUTZ: A lot of times, they're just, like, super skinny or empty inside, and they're not marketable at all. SOMMER: So Mutz and her partners have started urchin ranching. They catch them in the wild, then fatten them up at a shellfish farm. Since the pandemic started, she's been selling direct to customers. For this San Francisco pop-up, her online store sold 300 urchins in six minutes. MUTZ: The word has gotten out about the nuisance of the purple urchin. So it's like, oh, I'm doing really great for the environment; I'm going to eat these guys.

The feathers adorned the clothes and headdresses of elites and even carried spiritual significance. JOSE CAPRILES: You know, in a place with so limited resources and so limited color, if you think about it - there were not a lot of sources of brightly colored things - these feathers were incredibly important. AILSA CHANG, HOST:  That's Jose Capriles of Penn State. He says the birds were raised and nurtured for their feathers and sometimes ritually mummified. CAPRILES: We've all seen, like, you know, whole chickens on a supermarket. And (laughter) these are - just have a few more feathers, if you will. CHANG: His team studied the faded feathers and mummies of 27 birds found decades ago at archaeological sites in the Atacama Desert in Chile. Using radiocarbon dating and ancient DNA analysis, the researchers ID'd at least six different species of birds which lived 600 to 900 years ago. CORNISH: But that leaves the question of how the birds got to these desert oases. The Atacama is one of the driest places in the world and hundreds of miles from where the birds live today. CHANG: Capriles now thinks the answer may be vast trade routes, which twisted through the craggy Andes and out to the Amazon rainforest - oh, and all done by caravans of llamas. CAPRILES: So that required quite a bit of sophisticated knowledge - you know, being able to trap the birds, keep them in captivity and then transport them across these high mountains. It was a cultural, social, ritual phenomenon. These feathers really cross-cut these different spheres of value. CORNISH: The work appears in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. CHANG: Studying these trade routes was also a personal journey for Capriles. His mother Eliana Flores Bedregal was an ornithologist and co-author on the paper. She died of cancer before they finished the work, and Capriles hopes that, wherever she is, she feels proud of what they achieved. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:   Like rare gems or high-end cars today, the colorful feathers of parrots and macaws were once signs of wealth and status in the pre-Columbian Americas. The feathers adorned the clothes and headdresses of elites and even carried spiritual significance. JOSE CAPRILES: You know, in a place with so limited resources and so limited color, if you think about it - there were not a lot of sources of brightly colored things - these feathers were incredibly important. AILSA CHANG, HOST:   That's Jose Capriles of Penn State. He says the birds were raised and nurtured for their feathers and sometimes ritually mummified. CAPRILES: We've all seen, like, you know, whole chickens on a supermarket. And (laughter) these are - just have a few more feathers, if you will. CHANG: His team studied the faded feathers and mummies of 27 birds found decades ago at archaeological sites in the Atacama Desert in Chile. Using radiocarbon dating and ancient DNA analysis, the researchers ID'd at least six different species of birds which lived 600 to 900 years ago. CORNISH: But that leaves the question of how the birds got to these desert oases. The Atacama is one of the driest places in the world and hundreds of miles from where the birds live today. CHANG: Capriles now thinks the answer may be vast trade routes, which twisted through the craggy Andes and out to the Amazon rainforest - oh, and all done by caravans of llamas.

Surveys show they're among the people least likely to say they will get the vaccine. NPR's Sarah McCammon reports on how pastors and public health leaders are working to change that among one of the nation's largest religious groups. SARAH MCCAMMON, BYLINE: In a certain segment of Christian eschatology, which is just a big word for what you think will happen at the end of the world, there's this idea of the mark of the beast. For the uninitiated, it's bad, and if you want to go to heaven, you'd better not get it. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE: And I asked the question earlier today, is this something like Biden's mark of the beast? - because that is really disturbing and not good. MCCAMMON: That's Georgia Republican Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene in a recent video posted online. Greene is suggesting - and, I have to say here, without evidence - a connection between that idea and vaccines. Jared Cornet is a pastor in Irving, Texas, and he's heard this, too, in some of his Southern Baptist Facebook groups. JARED CORNET: But to me, I have a very hard time from getting the vaccine to the mark of the beast. MCCAMMON: Cornet says thankfully, he hasn't heard that in his church, but he has run across some skepticism and misunderstandings about the science behind the coronavirus vaccine. Nationally, white evangelicals report a high degree of vaccine hesitancy. In one recent survey, just over half said they were likely to get vaccinated compared to 64% of evangelicals of color. Both groups were well below the rate for non-evangelicals - 77%. CORNET: And I think there's just disinformation as well. MCCAMMON: Cornet says some church members who oppose abortion also have moral concerns about how some of the vaccines were developed, including research involving fetal cells from abortions performed decades ago. Cornet has pointed them to expert sources and reassured them that he believes the vaccine is safe and ethical. These concerns about the vaccine pose a public health challenge, given that as many as 1 in 4 Americans of all racial backgrounds identify as evangelical. Several national evangelical leaders also are speaking out in support of vaccination, including Franklin Graham, son of the late Reverend Billy Graham. FRANKLIN GRAHAM: We have seen firsthand - at least I have - what coronavirus can do to a person. And it's frightening, and you don't want it. MCCAMMON: Graham's charity Samaritan's Purse set up several field hospitals to treat COVID-19 patients around the world. After posting on Facebook about his decision to get the Moderna vaccine, Graham received thousands of comments, some showing support but many expressing outrage, calling Graham a false prophet among other things. His niece, Jerushah Duford, is a granddaughter of Billy Graham and a frequent critic of the white evangelical Christian right. She wants more evangelical leaders to encourage their followers to get vaccinated. JERUSHAH DUFORD: I want the church to fight for others more than they're fighting for themselves. That's what I have not seen over the last year, and that's what we're called to do. MCCAMMON: Walter Kim, president of the National Association of Evangelicals, says church leaders can do that by changing the way they talk about the virus. WALTER KIM: The more we can move the discourse from a discourse about politics and political affiliation to the discourse of mission of love for neighbor, then I think we're tapping into something profoundly motivating for evangelicals.

And what if all we need to revitalize parts of our bodies is the right tool? ANDREW PELLING: Could we think about biology kind of like hardware? Could I take the pieces I'm interested in and sort of rewire them and put them together physically in different ways? ZOMORODI: This is Andrew Pelling. He's a biophysicist at the University of Ottawa. PELLING: And I run a research lab that creates augmented living biological systems. ZOMORODI: OK, augmented living biological systems - what the heck is that? Can you explain, please? PELLING: (Laughter) So we're really kind of interested in creating living tissues that might not normally be found in nature. We've also discovered ways to heal and regenerate living tissues in the human body. And what my lab has become very well-known for is creating an apple ear. And it's essentially an apple that we carved into the shape of a human ear. We processed it, decellularized it, pulled out all the plant cells and then repopulated it with human cells. ZOMORODI: OK. Wait a minute. Hold up. I just want you to say that one more time. You made an ear that has human cells out of an apple. PELLING: Mmm hmm. ZOMORODI: Can you just back up and explain this to me? PELLING: Yeah. It's a long story. But a lot of us have heard of approaches to biomedicine right now that might involve something called CRISPR or DNA technologies that you might engineer or change our DNA. And that's all really fascinating and very hard work. But my response to that type of effort has always been like, well, can we actually control our cells and tissues without even touching the DNA? So what we needed was a sort of scaffold, sort of a three-dimensional architecture we could grow our cells into. And we had found a way to take plant tissues we find in the grocery store. We can strip out all the plant cells. And all you're left with is this fibrous material, the stuff that gets stuck in your teeth when you're eating a salad or whatever. And that material, cellulose, was the three-dimensional scaffolding we were looking for. And it was really cheap. We could get it in the grocery store, and our cells could grow inside of it. ZOMORODI: OK. Wait, though. So you get an apple, but then how do you make an ear out of it? PELLING: So what we did (laughter) - we had been doing a lot of work with apples. And if you've ever cut an apple in half and looked at it, it does kind of look like two ears side by side, at least to me. And the only person in our orbit that we knew who could carve anything was actually my wife. She's a violin maker. And so I asked her, you know, could you carve me an ear from this piece of apple? And. . . ZOMORODI: So great. PELLING: I have a very loving and patient wife and. . . ZOMORODI: Yes. PELLING: She's kind of used to me at this point, so. . . ZOMORODI: Sure, honey. PELLING: . . . She got to it. I was modeling, and she carved us several ears. And I took them back to the lab. And so now I've got this, like, Tupperware container full of these pieces of apple that look like human ears. And what we do with them is we essentially put them into a large beaker. And inside of the beaker is the solution that we used to pull out all the plant cells. It's like a soap or detergent. And it slowly sort of shakes and spins over several days. It's a slow process to remove all of the cells. But at the end, what you get is - it's almost completely white, and it still holds its shape. It looks like an ear. And this scaffold or this implant, we can then put in a petri dish. We can put cells onto it, and we let them grow. And over time, they'll start to invade inside of the scaffold and fill it up with - as they replicate, and what you end up with is a really nice proof of concept of a plant-based human implant. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ZOMORODI: What kind of cells do you put into the scaffolding? PELLING: So we can actually put all sorts of cells. We've done work with muscle cells and sort of vascular cells and neurons, and you name it. Over the years, it's become fairly straightforward. You can grow almost anything in there. That's how generalizable it is. ZOMORODI: So you said it's a proof of concept. So tell me what you learned from being able to grow cells like this and why it's not being used to help people yet. PELLING: Well, I hope it will be helping people soon, and that's what we're working on now. That ear was the first proof of concept. It really convinced me and the whole team that what we had wasn't just some goofy, funny discovery but was something that could actually be quite impactful in terms of human health and well-being. And so what has happened since that time is now translating these materials into the clinical space. And we've actually, since that year, been able to demonstrate that not only can we make three-dimensional structural objects but, at least in the case of spinal cord, actually repair spinal cords in small animals. And this is really, really exciting and potentially revolutionary. ZOMORODI: And that brings us to what you're working on right now - right? - to repair spinal cord tissue using not an apple, but another food. PELLING: Yeah. We - it's funny. I was - in the early days, literally, we would go to the grocery store, just buy everything you could see. The lab would look like a farmer's market - like, just bags and bags of produce, and we just - decellularizing everything and throwing cells on them. And in the midst of all this, one day I was at home, and I was cooking asparagus for dinner. I had cut the ends of the asparagus off, and I was sort of looking at the sort of stalk and noticing all of those long capillaries, those little tubes inside the stalk. I started to wonder, you know, could we actually use those conduits as a way to guide neurons back together in the case of spinal cord injury? ZOMORODI: In a minute, more from Andrew Pelling on the extraordinary possibilities of rebuilding the body with produce. On the show today - ideas about revitalization. I'm Manoush Zomorodi, and you're listening to the TED Radio Hour from NPR. It's the TED Radio Hour from NPR. I'm Manoush Zomorodi. On the show today, ideas about revitalization. And before the break, we were talking to Andrew Pelling about his mind-boggling experiments, including a new idea to rebuild human spinal cords with asparagus. PELLING: And this wasn't a totally original idea or anything like that. There's been plenty of work on synthetic materials with tunnels and conduits and all that sort of thing. But again, I was wondering, you know, could it be this simple? Could I just go to the grocery store and find my scaffolding there? And the interesting thing about plant-based biomaterials is they don't break down. They're actually quite stable, long-lasting. So we, again, stripped out all the cells and made some asparagus scaffolds. And then I thought, well, I got to talk to an expert at this point because I'm so far out of my sort of comfort zone at this stage. So I looked around. And one of the top neurosurgeons in Canada happened to be right here in my own city, in Ottawa, and we brought her some scaffolds. And she spent time thinking about this and looking at them. And her first question to me was, can I take these today and use them in a patient? ZOMORODI: What? PELLING: (Laughter) Yeah. I was like, you neuro people are crazier than me, man. Like, this is. . . ZOMORODI: Wow. Yeah. PELLING: One of the problems that she had seen and experienced was that scaffolding that she had used previously had always broken down. And this is what really excited her about what we were proposing, was a scaffold that was long-lasting and stable. And so thankfully, she was willing to collaborate and helped us sort of design some preliminary animal studies to first look at, you know, the efficacy of this scaffold in repairing a severe spinal cord injury. ZOMORODI: And so you basically started a study where you put this asparagus implant in some animals with spinal cord injuries, right? And what happened? PELLING: One of the most fascinating things I've ever witnessed in my life started to happen a few weeks after this, about two weeks. The animals that received the implants, they started - they looked like they were having sort of pins and needles in their legs. They were sort of scratching at their rear legs and biting at them. It was like they were gaining some feeling back. And over the course of the next - over the course of about 12 weeks, we watched these animals go from being paralyzed from the waist down to starting to move their legs - so left, right, left, right - and then starting to lift themselves up on their back legs and lift their bellies off the ground. This is a really important step in recovery. And this is also showing that those core muscles are getting activated, the legs are getting activated, healthy cells migrate inside of the scaffold and it really just becomes a living tissue within the body. It becomes something that's kept alive by the heart. And by no means were the animals perfectly walking or anything like that, but this for us was an incredible moment because what seemed like such a far-fetched, you know, idea appeared to actually have legs to it and potentially could impact tens of thousands, if not millions of lives on the planet. And I've never, never expected as a scientist to be involved in something that important. And late last year, we announced that this technology was just designated a breakthrough medical device by the FDA. This is going to dramatically speed up the timeline between when - you know, from going from the bench to eventually to the patient. ZOMORODI: So how do you get to the point where asparagus can actually be a potentially viable therapy for someone who has a spinal cord injury? Like what - walk - like, what does that look like? Is - are we talking five years, 50 years? PELLING: That is a good question. I mean, you know, it's interesting. As I've met and spoken with many people who live with spinal cord injury, you know, walking, of course, is sort of held out as that holy grail. But there are these really just - these things that we take for granted that you lose - you know, the ability to control your bladder, you know, sexual function, scratching an itch, feeling an itch, you know? There are these dramatic - these things that seem small but can have dramatic impacts on human life. Now, the timeline, that's - I think it's difficult for me to give you an answer on that. I mean, we've heard timelines before and been disappointed. So I think we need to be realistic here. But those human trials are about two years down the road from now, but we've got - we still have to meet certain milestones and prove to the FDA that we're ready for that. And that's part of what we're working on every single day now, and it's what keeps me up pretty much all the time, so (laughter). . . ZOMORODI: That's biophysicist Andrew Pelling. You can check out his talks at ted. com. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MANOUSH ZOMORODI, HOST:   On the show today - ideas about revitalizing and rebuilding.

And that material, cellulose, was the three-dimensional scaffolding we were looking for. And it was really cheap. We could get it in the grocery store, and our cells could grow inside of it. ZOMORODI: OK. Wait, though. So you get an apple, but then how do you make an ear out of it? PELLING: So what we did (laughter) - we had been doing a lot of work with apples. And if you've ever cut an apple in half and looked at it, it does kind of look like two ears side by side, at least to me. And the only person in our orbit that we knew who could carve anything was actually my wife. She's a violin maker. And so I asked her, you know, could you carve me an ear from this piece of apple? And. . . ZOMORODI: So great. PELLING: I have a very loving and patient wife and. . . ZOMORODI: Yes. PELLING: She's kind of used to me at this point, so. . . ZOMORODI: Sure, honey. PELLING: . . . She got to it. I was modeling, and she carved us several ears. And I took them back to the lab. And so now I've got this, like, Tupperware container full of these pieces of apple that look like human ears. And what we do with them is we essentially put them into a large beaker. And inside of the beaker is the solution that we used to pull out all the plant cells. It's like a soap or detergent. And it slowly sort of shakes and spins over several days. It's a slow process to remove all of the cells. But at the end, what you get is - it's almost completely white, and it still holds its shape. It looks like an ear. And this scaffold or this implant, we can then put in a petri dish. We can put cells onto it, and we let them grow. And over time, they'll start to invade inside of the scaffold and fill it up with - as they replicate, and what you end up with is a really nice proof of concept of a plant-based human implant. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ZOMORODI: What kind of cells do you put into the scaffolding? PELLING: So we can actually put all sorts of cells. We've done work with muscle cells and sort of vascular cells and neurons, and you name it. Over the years, it's become fairly straightforward. You can grow almost anything in there. That's how generalizable it is. ZOMORODI: So you said it's a proof of concept. So tell me what you learned from being able to grow cells like this and why it's not being used to help people yet. PELLING: Well, I hope it will be helping people soon, and that's what we're working on now. That ear was the first proof of concept. It really convinced me and the whole team that what we had wasn't just some goofy, funny discovery but was something that could actually be quite impactful in terms of human health and well-being. And so what has happened since that time is now translating these materials into the clinical space. And we've actually, since that year, been able to demonstrate that not only can we make three-dimensional structural objects but, at least in the case of spinal cord, actually repair spinal cords in small animals. And this is really, really exciting and potentially revolutionary. ZOMORODI: And that brings us to what you're working on right now - right? - to repair spinal cord tissue using not an apple, but another food. PELLING: Yeah. We - it's funny. I was - in the early days, literally, we would go to the grocery store, just buy everything you could see. The lab would look like a farmer's market - like, just bags and bags of produce, and we just - decellularizing everything and throwing cells on them. And in the midst of all this, one day I was at home, and I was cooking asparagus for dinner. I had cut the ends of the asparagus off, and I was sort of looking at the sort of stalk and noticing all of those long capillaries, those little tubes inside the stalk. I started to wonder, you know, could we actually use those conduits as a way to guide neurons back together in the case of spinal cord injury? ZOMORODI: In a minute, more from Andrew Pelling on the extraordinary possibilities of rebuilding the body with produce. On the show today - ideas about revitalization. I'm Manoush Zomorodi, and you're listening to the TED Radio Hour from NPR. It's the TED Radio Hour from NPR. I'm Manoush Zomorodi. On the show today, ideas about revitalization. And before the break, we were talking to Andrew Pelling about his mind-boggling experiments, including a new idea to rebuild human spinal cords with asparagus. PELLING: And this wasn't a totally original idea or anything like that. There's been plenty of work on synthetic materials with tunnels and conduits and all that sort of thing. But again, I was wondering, you know, could it be this simple? Could I just go to the grocery store and find my scaffolding there? And the interesting thing about plant-based biomaterials is they don't break down. They're actually quite stable, long-lasting. So we, again, stripped out all the cells and made some asparagus scaffolds. And then I thought, well, I got to talk to an expert at this point because I'm so far out of my sort of comfort zone at this stage. So I looked around. And one of the top neurosurgeons in Canada happened to be right here in my own city, in Ottawa, and we brought her some scaffolds. And she spent time thinking about this and looking at them. And her first question to me was, can I take these today and use them in a patient? ZOMORODI: What? PELLING: (Laughter) Yeah. I was like, you neuro people are crazier than me, man. Like, this is. . . ZOMORODI: Wow. Yeah. PELLING: One of the problems that she had seen and experienced was that scaffolding that she had used previously had always broken down. And this is what really excited her about what we were proposing, was a scaffold that was long-lasting and stable. And so thankfully, she was willing to collaborate and helped us sort of design some preliminary animal studies to first look at, you know, the efficacy of this scaffold in repairing a severe spinal cord injury. ZOMORODI: And so you basically started a study where you put this asparagus implant in some animals with spinal cord injuries, right? And what happened? PELLING: One of the most fascinating things I've ever witnessed in my life started to happen a few weeks after this, about two weeks. The animals that received the implants, they started - they looked like they were having sort of pins and needles in their legs. They were sort of scratching at their rear legs and biting at them. It was like they were gaining some feeling back. And over the course of the next - over the course of about 12 weeks, we watched these animals go from being paralyzed from the waist down to starting to move their legs - so left, right, left, right - and then starting to lift themselves up on their back legs and lift their bellies off the ground. This is a really important step in recovery. And this is also showing that those core muscles are getting activated, the legs are getting activated, healthy cells migrate inside of the scaffold and it really just becomes a living tissue within the body. It becomes something that's kept alive by the heart. And by no means were the animals perfectly walking or anything like that, but this for us was an incredible moment because what seemed like such a far-fetched, you know, idea appeared to actually have legs to it and potentially could impact tens of thousands, if not millions of lives on the planet. And I've never, never expected as a scientist to be involved in something that important. And late last year, we announced that this technology was just designated a breakthrough medical device by the FDA. This is going to dramatically speed up the timeline between when - you know, from going from the bench to eventually to the patient. ZOMORODI: So how do you get to the point where asparagus can actually be a potentially viable therapy for someone who has a spinal cord injury? Like what - walk - like, what does that look like? Is - are we talking five years, 50 years? PELLING: That is a good question. I mean, you know, it's interesting. As I've met and spoken with many people who live with spinal cord injury, you know, walking, of course, is sort of held out as that holy grail. But there are these really just - these things that we take for granted that you lose - you know, the ability to control your bladder, you know, sexual function, scratching an itch, feeling an itch, you know? There are these dramatic - these things that seem small but can have dramatic impacts on human life. Now, the timeline, that's - I think it's difficult for me to give you an answer on that. I mean, we've heard timelines before and been disappointed. So I think we need to be realistic here. But those human trials are about two years down the road from now, but we've got - we still have to meet certain milestones and prove to the FDA that we're ready for that. And that's part of what we're working on every single day now, and it's what keeps me up pretty much all the time, so (laughter). . . ZOMORODI: That's biophysicist Andrew Pelling.

Scientists say it will take a long time for the atmosphere to show the benefits, but the cuts are crucial if humans hope to avoid the most catastrophic effects of climate change. NPR's Rebecca Hersher reports. REBECCA HERSHER, BYLINE: Last week, the Earth hit a new record for the concentration of carbon dioxide up in the atmosphere - 420 parts per million. To put that in perspective, humans are now halfway to doubling the amount of CO2 up there, which is why hurricanes and heat waves, wildfires and droughts are all getting more severe. SOLOMON HSIANG: The reason we have a problem right now is because we are pumping more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than natural systems can absorb. HERSHER: Solomon Hsiang is a climate scientist at Berkeley. CO2 and other greenhouse gases come out of tailpipes and smokestacks. They drift up into the air, mixing with oxygen and nitrogen and water vapor. And then they just stay there, trapping heat from the sun. HSIANG: Greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide, spend a long time in the atmosphere. HERSHER: Here is the thing about carbon dioxide. It is not a gas that particularly likes playing with other gases. It's pretty stable. So once it's in the atmosphere, it stays in the atmosphere until it's reabsorbed by something down on Earth, like the ocean or a tree or a rock, which can take a long time. JAMES BUTLER: If you want to get rid of the CO2 in the atmosphere, we're talking thousands of years. HERSHER: James Butler leads greenhouse gas monitoring for one of the federal government's big atmospheric science labs. BUTLER: As we start to reduce the CO2 emissions, say, we cut them off, it would still be a lot of CO2 in the atmosphere. And that will continue to warm the planet. HERSHER: It's not just CO2. Another greenhouse gas, nitrous oxide, takes about a century to break down. Methane, which mostly comes from agriculture and oil and gas wells, is a funny one. It's extremely good at trapping heat, much better than CO2, but it's way less stable, so it breaks down after about 10 years. But when it breaks down, methane can turn into CO2. This is why greenhouse gases accumulate in the atmosphere over time and why, even if the U. S. were to dramatically reduce emissions immediately, it would take a little while for the atmosphere to catch up. HSIANG: So it's kind of like you're driving a giant train. It's very heavy. You slam on the brakes. The train keeps going for a while, so there is some amount of heating that we would continue to experience. HERSHER: Hsiang says cutting emissions as much as possible as quickly as possible is absolutely crucial. It will make the world a lot safer for people who are in kindergarten right now. But if humanity is a train that's about to hit its brakes, then it's important to remember that the train is headed for a cliff. And the people who are at the front of this train are those who are most vulnerable to rising seas, more severe heat waves, flooding and droughts. HSIANG: Those are the people that actually get sent off the cliff, right? They're the ones who really are harmed because we didn't stop the train fast enough. It doesn't mean everyone goes off the cliff. But it does mean, you know, that those people in the front lines - they're going to continue to bear the brunt of climate change for the next several decades. HERSHER: Around the world, the people on the front lines are more likely to be poor people. It's why cutting greenhouse gas emissions won't be enough on its own. Countries like the U. S. will need to help pay for the costs of adaptation because no matter what, it's going to be a dangerously hot century for a lot of people. Rebecca Hersher, NPR News.

S. greenhouse gas emissions. Environmental advocates want a 50% cut by 2030 compared to 2005 levels. I asked Lauren Sommer from NPR's climate team what life would look like in 2030 if we got there. LAUREN SOMMER, BYLINE: One of the first things he did as president was to rejoin the Paris climate accord. You know, that's the international agreement to limit emissions that former President Trump pulled out of. So as part of that, every country makes a commitment to cut emissions. So the Biden administration's commitment is just going to be this overarching framework for all his policies going forward. And, you know, both environmental groups and some major business leaders are pushing him to announce a cut of 50%. KING: OK. So we'll all be waiting to see what percentage he announces. Why 50%, though? What specifically about that do these groups like? SOMMER: Yeah. That's what the scientific studies are saying. You know, to avoid the worst impacts of climate change - so things like really extreme heat waves and extreme sea level rise - the world needs to go down to net zero emissions by mid-century. So that 2030 goal is what would put the U. S. on a path to do that. But, you know, even supporters like Danielle Arostegui at the Environmental Defense Fund, they say it's going to be tough. DANIELLE AROSTEGUI: It's pretty ambitious. This is not an easy target to achieve, but we think it is something that is achievable if we really kind of put the pedal to the metal here. KING: So what would the country look like in 2030 if we're emitting half as much carbon? SOMMER: Yeah. That's something that a number of researchers have looked at. And the biggest change would likely be where our electricity comes from. So solar, wind and other renewables would be a much bigger part of the grid. And that's something that's already happening because their cost has come down so much. The flip side of that is that coal power would shrink dramatically. But Nate Hultman, who directs the Center for Global Sustainability at the University of Maryland, says that's also already happening. NATE HULTMAN: It actually is uneconomical in many cases to continue to burn coal even regardless of the climate and health impacts of that. So coal is struggling already. And it's unlikely that it will continue in any significant form beyond 2030. KING: I want to ask you about another big source of emissions, which are cars. Let's say it is 2030 and we hit the goal. And I'm looking around at the roads. What am I seeing? SOMMER: You wouldn't see much different on the roads, maybe. But you would see very different car dealerships. . . KING: Oh. SOMMER: . . . Because from half to all of new car sales would need to be electric cars by 2030. But on the roads, it might not be that different because there'd still be gas-powered cars. You know, cars last a long time, right? You drive them more than a decade maybe. So any policy change there takes years to be felt. KING: All of these policies would require significant political buy-in. Is it likely that the Biden administration could really move fast enough to reach a 50% cut? SOMMER: Yeah. I think it's a good question. There's a lot he can do with executive powers. But it would be very difficult for the U. S. to hit that target without congressional action, you know, whether it's new spending or new regulation. And, you know, that's the fine line that Biden's going to be walking with international leaders. He's trying to encourage other nations to meet their commitments to cut emissions. So he's going to have to prove that the U. S. can do what it says it will on climate change. KING: NPR's Lauren Sommer. Thanks so much, Lauren. SOMMER: Thanks.

It is the life of the incredible Indian jumping ant. Usually, once the queen of an ant colony dies, the colony falls apart, but not with these ants. Their workers can battle it out for up to a month to try to become new insect royalty. And along the way, the newly crowned queen's brain shrinks, and her ovaries expand. And the losing combatants' brains expand back to their original pre-combat size while their ovaries shrink. This is all according to a new study led by Clint Penick. He's an assistant professor of biology at Kennesaw State University in Georgia, and he joins us now. Hello. CLINT PENICK: Hi, Lulu. Good to be here. GARCIA-NAVARRO: This is super weird. (LAUGHTER)GARCIA-NAVARRO: Let me just start by saying that. First, tell us about these ants. I'm told that they actually do jump. PENICK: Yeah. So what these ants do - they - when they leave their nest to forage, they walk around the leaf litter in the jungles of western India, searching for a little insect prey. And when they see one, when they see, like, a cricket or a spider, what they'll do is they'll wait. And almost like a leopard or a lion, when the cricket gets close, they'll pounce and jump on them and sting them and then bring them back to the nest. GARCIA-NAVARRO: So why these shrinking and expanding of brains and ovaries? PENICK: Yeah. An unusual trait about this species is that the workers have reevolved the ability to mate and reproduce. So in most ants, the queen is the only member of the colony that lays eggs. The workers just do all of the hunting and take care of the babies and all of the chores in the colony. But the queen is the only one who reproduces. And when she dies, the colony dies. But in the Indian jumping ant, what happens is that once the queen dies, because the workers can mate and reproduce, it actually triggers a dominance tournament, and they'll fight each other over a month to decide who's going to be the next ant to replace the queen. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Sounds very medieval. (LAUGHTER)PENICK: Yeah. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Do they all have ovaries, or do the male ants just kind of stand back and watch the female ants go to battle? PENICK: Males don't play a large role in any ant colony of any species. They have one purpose, and it's to leave the nest and mate. And so after they mate, they die, and they don't contribute to the colony after that. And all of the workers in a colony of ants is actually female, and so they do have ovaries. GARCIA-NAVARRO: And how in the world did you figure this particular trait out? And how do you measure the brain of an ant anyway? That sounds like it might be a hard thing to do. PENICK: Yeah. So, you know, I already knew that these ants - that their brains shrunk once they became reproductive. So this was known previously. But what we didn't know was if they had the capacity to regrow them back to their previous size. The typical wisdom is that once you lose brain cells, they don't come back. I know that's what my parents told me when I was growing up. But, of course, we are now starting to find that there are animal species that are capable of shrinking their brain and then regrowing them - even humans to some degree but not nearly on the scale to what we see here. And - but when we started this study, we didn't know if any insect was actually capable of this. And so what we had to do is figure out a way to take this royalty and convert them back to a typical worker. And once we were able to do that, then, yeah - then it came right down to having steady hands and working under a microscope and being able to dissect out their brains to take a picture of them. GARCIA-NAVARRO: So let's talk about this life-extension thing because, of course, that's fascinating. If a worker wins the combat and becomes queen, its life span expands from around six months to five years? PENICK: Yeah, their lifespan dramatically increases. Once they win one of these tournaments, it triggers, like, a hormone cascade and a whole suite of gene changes. And all of those result in them living up to five years. GARCIA-NAVARRO: I mean, how many tournaments have you witnessed? (LAUGHTER)GARCIA-NAVARRO: I mean, it must be, like, amazing to see these battles between these ants sort of take place. PENICK: Yeah. When - so we actually maintain over 200 colonies of this species in the lab. And so on any given day, usually one of them has cycled and is doing one of these tournaments. And yeah, in grad school, we actually - one of my jobs was to paint every worker in an ant colony. So they all got a colour code, and each individual was labeled, so we knew their names. And I would sit there for hours and hours and hours, just watching them duel each other and bite each other and write down what everyone did. GARCIA-NAVARRO: God bless you. What is the practical application of all this? I mean, does it give us insight into our own brains? PENICK: It tells us that brains are a lot more plastic and have a lot more abilities to change back and forth between their size than we knew. And ants - their brains have some shared traits with humans, believe it or not. So now we're looking at digging into some of the genetic and other neural mechanisms that are underlying these brain changes. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Astonishing. Indian jumping ant expert and assistant professor of biology at Kennesaw State University Clint Penick, thank you very much. PENICK: Thank you. It was great to be here. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"THE TIME OF YOUR LIFE\")RANDY NEWMAN: (Singing) Was a bug, little bug, hardly there - how he felt, what he dreamed, who would care? LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST:   Expanding brains, shrinking brains, the ability to increase lifetimes by a factor of 10 - no, this isn't some B-grade 1950s sci-fi film. It is the life of the incredible Indian jumping ant. Usually, once the queen of an ant colony dies, the colony falls apart, but not with these ants. Their workers can battle it out for up to a month to try to become new insect royalty. And along the way, the newly crowned queen's brain shrinks, and her ovaries expand. And the losing combatants' brains expand back to their original pre-combat size while their ovaries shrink. This is all according to a new study led by Clint Penick. He's an assistant professor of biology at Kennesaw State University in Georgia, and he joins us now. Hello. CLINT PENICK: Hi, Lulu. Good to be here. GARCIA-NAVARRO: This is super weird. (LAUGHTER) GARCIA-NAVARRO: Let me just start by saying that. First, tell us about these ants. I'm told that they actually do jump. PENICK: Yeah. So what these ants do - they - when they leave their nest to forage, they walk around the leaf litter in the jungles of western India, searching for a little insect prey. And when they see one, when they see, like, a cricket or a spider, what they'll do is they'll wait. And almost like a leopard or a lion, when the cricket gets close, they'll pounce and jump on them and sting them and then bring them back to the nest. GARCIA-NAVARRO: So why these shrinking and expanding of brains and ovaries? PENICK: Yeah. An unusual trait about this species is that the workers have reevolved the ability to mate and reproduce.

(SOUNDBITE OF DROP ELECTRIC SONG, \"WAKING UP TO THE FIRE\")SALLY HERSHIPS, HOST:  We got an email from a listener not too long ago. It was about their work, so they asked not to be named. But what we can tell you is that this person is a scientist, and they wrote to us about a shortage of one supply in particular. DAVID GURA, HOST:  Here's what that email said. I'm a scientist, and there is a major shortage in basic lab supplies that are made from plastic/polypropylene. What are the economics of plastic trade and manufacturing such that they can't keep up with demand? HERSHIPS: Remember at the beginning of the pandemic when all those weird, previously basic-seeming products were sold out at the store, like toilet paper? GURA: Toilet paper - chocolate chips was another. I couldn't find flour. It seemed like everybody was stress baking. HERSHIPS: For many of us, luckily, those shortages have gone away, but for scientists, no dice. All kinds of plastic lab supplies - plastic tubes, petri dishes. Even the robots that use them can be back-ordered for months. For scientists, this is like trying to work in a restaurant without pots and pans. So prices are soaring. Scientists are bartering. They are even hoarding supplies. If you are a lab scientist right now, plastics are the new toilet paper. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)GURA: Welcome to THE INDICATOR. I'm David Gura. HERSHIPS: And I'm Sally Herships. We are in for Stacey Vanek Smith. GURA: On today's show, we go on a hunt to track down the answer to this particular listener's question. What is behind the shortages in the multibillion-dollar plastic lab supply industry? (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)GURA: We couldn't talk to the scientist who wrote in - at least, not on air. So instead, we called up another scientist facing the same problem - not enough plastic lab supplies. Monica Tomaszewski is a scientist in Pittsburgh. She researches drugs for rare genetic diseases, the kind that mostly don't have cures, just supportive care. HERSHIPS: For us nonscientist people, the lab Monica works in looks kind of like a high school chemistry lab - all those waist-high gray countertops, lots of white cabinets. It's brightly lit. There are shiny floors with those colored geometric patterns all over them but way fancier because Monica uses all kinds of high-tech equipment, even robots. But right now one of her biggest stumbling blocks is this plastic shortage. MONICA TOMASZEWSKI: We have a co-worker who has what we refer to as the stash - several boxes of different types of things that are underneath a lab bench that you have to actually crawl under to get. HERSHIPS: Like, down on your hands and knees. TOMASZEWSKI: Yeah. GURA: Monica's stash is mostly full of these plastic tubes called pipettes. They look kind of like eyedroppers. They're basically straws. You use them to suck liquid up out of one tube and drop it into another. Chances are, if you're running experiments on anything from blood to urine to mysterious cancerous cells, you will be using a pipette. HERSHIPS: They come in different, very precise sizes. It's really important that you have the right one. Otherwise, your pipette might be too skinny. TOMASZEWSKI: Or they might be too short, which means that we can't reach the bottom of the thing that we're trying to get the liquid out of. GURA: Which is a problem. Most of these pipettes, these plastic tubes, are single-use because scientists can't risk contaminating their samples. The prices can vary, depending on the size and whether or not you buy in bulk. But the ones Monica uses tend to be around 50 cents each. These are staples of the science world. If you work in a lab, you could be using hundreds of these a day. HERSHIPS: Monica says, at her lab, the problem started last summer when pipettes became really hard to find. One of her co-workers requested a quote back in January. TOMASZEWSKI: And they're not supposed to be in our lab until June. HERSHIPS: When it comes to buying plastic supplies for science labs, there's an added wrinkle. It's a dilemma that we nonscience-y consumers also have to deal with, which is when you buy lab equipment, you are buying into this whole ecosystem. It's like when you buy a phone, and you have to decide, do you want to get an iPhone? Should you get an iPhone? It's a really big decision because then you need all of these other Apple products - the special charger, the AirPods. GURA: And the same thing is true in Monica's lab. Certain science equipment only works with certain other equipment. And that means Monica can't just buy supplies from any company, which makes tracking down supplies during a shortage even harder and is also a major time suck. HERSHIPS: So instead of spending your time science-ing, you're spending your time, like, online shopping. TOMASZEWSKI: Yes, yes. HERSHIPS: When scientists like Monica need to buy supplies, they order from a kind of Staples or Amazon or OfficeMax of the lab supply world. Gabe Howell (ph) works with one of these companies. It's a midsized lab supply distributor based in San Diego. Normally, scientists might just place their orders with Gabe. But right now, he's getting a lot of frustrated texts. He says there are a ton of reasons for the shortage. GABE HOWELL: Kind of the perfect storm (laughter) if you want to put it that way. GURA: Gabe is not speaking metaphorically here. He's talking about an actual storm, the one that left huge parts of Texas and a bunch of chemical plants there that kind of make plastic without power, creating a supply problem. On top of that, there are shipping delays. When ships dock, he says they often have to quarantine before unloading. HOWELL: I've heard there's delays in finding shipping containers, even. We had a ship that arrived in Long Beach. And it sat in port for, I believe, two weeks just waiting to get unloaded. And there was nothing we could do about it. HERSHIPS: These quarantines are in place because of the pandemic, which is affecting other parts of the supply chain as well. Corning, which makes tubes and vials and other lab supplies, has a whole letter explaining the delays on its website. And it says one of the biggest slowdowns is because of the U. S. Defense Production Act, which prioritizes supplies for COVID testing. It allows the government to tell manufacturers, hey, you have to sell to the folks who are making COVID tests first. HOWELL: Each COVID test uses four pipette tips on average, and we're doing millions and millions a day. GURA: And this whole problem, this shortage, can be easier for big companies and big research labs to deal with than smaller ones. It's not exactly that the big companies get prioritized. Instead, Gabe says manufacturers will give the really big companies a rep to deal with purchasing, procurement, managing their inventory. And having somebody on the inside is what gives them a leg up during a supply shortage. HOWELL: They're there whispering in your ear, saying, hey, buy some toilet paper. (Laughter) We're going to have a shortage soon. HERSHIPS: But Gabe works for a distributor, so he also has to go shopping. His company buys supplies from a manufacturer. That's the next link in the supply chain. Thermo Fisher Scientific is a manufacturer, makes plastic lab supplies. And it says since demand started spiking, it's invested more than $150 million in new capacity. It's increased output, but it just cannot go fast enough. Dae Hong works with Thermo Fisher, and he says one big reason is that it can take up to a year to start cranking out a new product. DAE HONG: You got to get the mold, the machine, the assembly stations and automation - like, robots. You've got to put them all together in the factory. Then, usually, you have to send them off to a sterilization facility because they need to be sterile. Then they go off to a warehouse in order to be distributed. GURA: Thermo Fisher has factories around the world - in Rochester, N. Y. ; Tijuana, Mexico; Denmark. And they've had to ship some supplies by air instead of boat, which can be way more expensive. And Dae says Thermo Fisher has had to create over a thousand new jobs as part of its expansion. Just think of all the time that takes hiring. HONG: Yes. We had to bring on a lot of folks over the past six months - both, you know, factory workers, as well as supervisors, people in supply chain, quality, product management, finance - to ensure that we could actually bring all this together. It is a really complex effort. HERSHIPS: So to get back to our listener's question, there are a lot of reasons for the shortage. All of those COVID tests are taking priority right now. And back in her lab in Pittsburgh, Monica, the scientist, says she gets it. She's a virologist by training. She knows how much work and research goes into viruses and how important vaccines are. But the drugs she's working on are for rare diseases. They don't have cures yet. And she can see the perspective of the patients who are waiting for those drugs too. TOMASZEWSKI: I'm happy that those researchers are able to get everything that they need. But we never shut down either. So we're just working through what's available, and it's important for us to move forward as well. HERSHIPS: But for now, she'll have to wait.

It's not gold or jewels. Rather, it's part of an experiment hidden more than a century ago by a botanist who worked at what's now Michigan State University. NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce reports on what he stashed away and why. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE, BYLINE: It was 4 a. m. , dark, cold and lightly snowing. The four scientists hoped no one would notice as they gathered together on the campus of Michigan State University. LARS BRUDVIG: Do you know where we're headed? FRANK TELEWSKI: Yep. BRUDVIG: OK, good. GREENFIELDBOYCE: They brought flashlights, a shovel and an old map showing the secret location. (SOUNDBITE OF SHOVELS DIGGING)GREENFIELDBOYCE: They took turns digging. TELEWSKI: How deep is that? That's about - what? - eight inches? DAVID LOWRY: Sixteen inches. MARJORIE WEBER: Do you want the tape measurer? TELEWSKI: Yeah. LOWRY: Let's dig here. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Professor Frank Telewski was the only one of them who'd done this before two decades ago. That's when he first took on the role of caretaker for a long-term experiment - a really long-term experiment, one that started in 1879. Telewski explains that way back then, a botanist named William Beal wanted to answer a question. How long can the seeds of weeds remain viable underground? TELEWSKI: And what he did is he got 20 bottles, and those 20 bottles he filled up with a sandy seed mixture. And the sandy seed mixture contained 21 species of plants with 50 seeds per plant. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Telewski says the original idea was to dig up a bottle every five years and try to get its seeds to sprout. Beal did that until he retired in 1910. Then he handed his experiment off to another scientist, who handed it off to another and so on until Telewski got the honor. He and the other caretakers have kept this experiment going longer than Beal ever intended because they switched to digging up a bottle every 10 years, then every 20 years. As Telewski got ready for this latest excavation, he started thinking about the future. TELEWSKI: I decided we needed to pass this on to the next generation, as I turned 65 last year. GREENFIELDBOYCE: So he picked three young colleagues at Michigan State University to be the new caretakers - Marjorie Weber, David Lowry and Lars Brudvig. David Lowry says he first heard of this experiment two decades ago when he was a student in California. LOWRY: I was blown away by the length and time in which it was occurring. I never imagined I'd be involved as well. GREENFIELDBOYCE: But there he was, digging in the dark. The team recorded their adventure. Lars Brudvig says this felt different than doing his own experiments. BRUDVIG: Almost, like, more pressure or something than normal because I, like - you know, I'm part of this bigger process. It's bigger than me. GREENFIELDBOYCE: They all watched as Marjorie Weber stuck her head in the hole and started feeling around in the dirt. WEBER: Oh. TELEWSKI: I hope I'm right. WEBER: I think I found it. TELEWSKI: Woo (ph). WEBER: Wait - maybe not. (LAUGHTER)LOWRY: Come on, Marjorie. WEBER: Oh, it was a rock. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Then she felt another smooth object. WEBER: OK, now I for real found it. GREENFIELDBOYCE: And she invited Frank Telewski to get down there and check it out. TELEWSKI: Wow. Oh, wow. Hello, bottles. Oh, thank you. All right, well. . . GREENFIELDBOYCE: Marjorie Weber says getting to pull out a bottle was really special. WEBER: The last person to touch it was Professor Beal 140 years ago, you know, this person who was writing letters to Darwin. GREENFIELDBOYCE: The researchers immediately planted the seeds in potting soil, and earlier today David Lowry went to the lab to check. LOWRY: Looking over the soil - oh, my God, there's something that germinated. We've got one seedling coming up right now. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Marjorie Weber says Beal's original question is still relevant. WEBER: We know that seeds can last a really long time in really perfect conditions, like in seed storage vaults or in the permafrost. We have these instances of seeds lasting a long time. But we really don't know how long seeds lasts just in the soil, and that's where most of the seeds are. GREENFIELDBOYCE: There are four bottles left, so this seed viability study still has 80 more years to go. Nell Greenfieldboyce, NPR News.

Methane is a significant source of human-caused greenhouse gases. NPR's Jeff Brady is covering the story. Jeff, good morning. JEFF BRADY, BYLINE: Good morning. INSKEEP: When we say revive rules, what are lawmakers trying to do? BRADY: Well, they first need to reverse a Trump administration regulation from last year that essentially rolled back previous rules limiting methane leaks from oil and gas. And with the Trump rules gone, stricter Obama-era regulations would be reinstated. Those require drillers to look for and plug leaks across the production process from the well to pipelines and valves along the way. This is the first time Democrats have used the Congressional Review Act to eliminate rules from the last administration. You may remember, Republicans used the law quite a bit at the start of the Trump administration. It's significant that Democrats are choosing methane for this action because scientists tell us that fixing those leaks now, it provides a jumpstart on addressing climate change. INSKEEP: Oh, that's interesting. So it's like a regulatory yo-yo. Obama did one thing; Trump went the other way; now they're going back again. But what makes methane such a big deal? BRADY: Well, methane is a more potent greenhouse gas than the one we mostly have heard of - carbon dioxide. Some estimates show it has more than 80 times the heat-trapping power of CO2, at least for the first two decades that it's in the atmosphere. An Environmental Defense Fund study recently showed that cutting methane emissions now could save the rate of - could slow the rate of global warming by as much as 30%. Dan Grossman with the group says that means a faster climate payoff. DAN GROSSMAN: If we're really going to bend the curve of greenhouse gas emissions to a way that we can stave off the most disruptive aspects of climate change, we have to bend that curve more quickly. And reducing methane emissions from the oil and gas sector is the easiest, most practical way to do that. BRADY: The White House says methane is responsible for about a third of the global warming we're experiencing now. And since the oil and gas sector is the largest methane emitter, the administration says it makes sense to crack down there. INSKEEP: What do oil and gas companies think about that? BRADY: It might be a little surprising because the industry is split on this. Big companies who are heavily invested in natural gas, they support the Obama regulations. Methane is the main ingredient in natural gas. And those big oil companies worry that if methane leaks aren't fixed, that will undermine their argument that gas is cleaner to burn than coal. Smaller companies, they oppose the Obama regulations generally, especially those with wells that don't produce much. They say expensive leak control measures could make their wells financially unviable. West Virginia Senator Shelley Moore Capito, she argued against the resolution. She said the industry already is reducing methane emissions. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)SHELLEY MOORE CAPITO: We shouldn't demonize an industry that is part of the lifeblood of our economy. We should celebrate the emission reduction accomplishments and look for ways to further incentivize those. BRADY: That didn't sway enough of her colleagues, though. The Senate voted to reverse the Trump regulations. A few GOP senators even crossed the aisle to vote with Democrats. Now the resolution goes to the House, where a vote is expected in coming weeks.

BENJAMIN PURPER, BYLINE: A construction crew is moving dirt at the site of Hell's Kitchen Lithium and Power in Calipatria, Calif. Just a few miles away in this harsh desert landscape are the shores of the Salton Sea, a manmade lake which is full of geothermal brine that can be used to produce energy and extract lithium. ROD COLWELL: The dirt's spread. The action's happening. So there's been too much talk about it and not enough action. Now the action is happening, so it's exciting times. PURPER: That's Rod Colwell, CEO of Controlled Thermal Resources, the company building this plant. On a windy plateau overlooking the Salton Sea, Colwell points out the lake is receding, which has exposed nearby communities to toxic dust, but it's also revealed some crucial resources. COLWELL: The sea's been receiving for up to about 20 to 40 yards a month, being the shallow lands down here, but which is quite ironic as it's exposing some of the best known lithium and geothermal resources on the planet. PURPER: Right now, most of the world's lithium comes from places like China, Australia and South American countries like Chile and Argentina. Most of the lithium they produce has a steep environmental cost, as it's done through mining or large evaporation ponds that take up lots of water. But geothermal lithium. . . COLWELL: Is 100% green, absolutely. Absolutely. From the steam that we produce to produce lithium for processing, green steam and green in the form of electricity as well. So it's pretty cool. PURPER: And there's a lot of venture capital being put into this around the Salton Sea. Investors like Bill Gates and Michael Bloomberg are all hoping for payoff as demand for lithium takes off. Mihri Ozkan at UC Riverside says the main driver is electric vehicles. California has pledged to phase out gas-powered vehicles. This year, general Motors said it aims to produce all electric vehicles by 2035. It's all part of such a strong global trend that Ozkan says lithium is now being called white gold. MIHRI OZKAN: So you have so much rich lithium source in the Salton Sea, and extraction of this definitely can turn this area to the Lithium Valley, if you like, not Silicon Valley, but the Lithium Valley. PURPER: Sophie Lu with Bloomberg NSF says that's an exciting concept. But right now, the United States gets most of its lithium from China. And even with increased lithium extraction in the Salton Sea, that's not likely to change anytime soon. SOPHIE LU: So at best, most optimistically, something might happen in the Salton Sea at an economic scale after 2025, like 2026 maybe, right? PURPER: Even then, Lu says it probably won't be enough to revolutionize the global supply chain for lithium. Rod Colwell of Controlled Thermal Resources acknowledges it's a long shot.

And up until now, we've been talking about human migration. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ZOMORODI: But, of course, humans aren't the only animals that migrate. SONIA ALTIZER: There are many hundreds, if not thousands of species of birds that migrate. ZOMORODI: There's caribou across Canada, wildebeest in Africa. ALTIZER: There are migratory fish, like salmon, and also a lot of marine animals migrate long distances, like sea turtles and whales. ZOMORODI: But right now, let's turn our attention to the humble but tenacious monarch butterfly. ALTIZER: I think of monarchs as the tanks of the butterfly world. ZOMORODI: (Laughter). ALTIZER: So they're small. They weigh only a half a gram, but they can travel thousands of kilometers in the wild. ZOMORODI: This is Sonia Altizer. ALTIZER: I'm an ecologist at the University of Georgia. So I study the ecology of animal migration. ZOMORODI: And Sonia says monarch butterflies are different because their migration is multigenerational. ALTIZER: So the same monarch never makes the journey twice. It's their grandoffspring and great-grandoffspring of the migratory generation that will migrate again the following year. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ZOMORODI: Sonia's specifically talking about a migration path east of the Rocky Mountains. These monarchs travel thousands of miles across international borders every year. Ecologists think they're looking for the precious milkweed plant. ALTIZER: You know, inarguably, the most important driver for them is food and especially milkweed plants where the females can lay their eggs. (SOUNDBITE OF BIRD CALLS)ZOMORODI: Another reason why they migrate is to ride out the winter in the Sierra Madre Mountains near Mexico City. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ALTIZER: So there might be 10 million butterflies or more in a single colony. And these colonies would be densely packed butterflies that are hanging in these beautiful fir forests. And so they're carpeting the trunks of trees. And it's almost like the butterflies spend the winter in the refrigerator. And then the temperature does warm up, you know, especially as the overwintering season progresses into the spring. And these clusters will sort of burst open, almost like orange confetti fluttering through the sky. ZOMORODI: Does it make a sound when they burst open like that? ALTIZER: It does. So it's almost like a very gentle wind or rustling of the leaves. (SOUNDBITE OF WIND)ALTIZER: And, sometimes, the air is so thick with butterflies that it might be hard to see a person standing 50 meters away just because there's so many butterflies flying through the air. ZOMORODI: By early March, it's time to procreate. So the butterflies leave the mountains for northern Mexico and Texas to lay their eggs on milkweed, the only plant that their caterpillars will eat. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ALTIZER: But by this time, they're really old, so they've been alive for about nine months. And eventually, you know, they die. And then it takes time for their offspring to develop. ZOMORODI: But by May, this new generation is ready to continue the journey north. ALTIZER: In the part of the United States that we refer to as the Corn Belt - so Iowa, Wisconsin, Minnesota and even farther north into Michigan and southern Canada. ZOMORODI: There, the butterflies have enough milkweed, nectar and sun to stay put and cycle through one, even two more generations. ALTIZER: But then the last generation at the end of the summer - it's the shorter day lengths and the cooler temperatures that signal to those butterflies, that generation, that it's time to get ready to migrate. And so instead of producing eggs and mating and, you know, hanging out in milkweed patches, those butterflies instead tank up on nectar. They build up their fat reserves, and they head south towards the overwintering sites in Mexico. And so they have to be in a special physiological state to be able to successfully make that migration. ZOMORODI: Huh. So they keep the species going. But it's this - I mean, I'm sorry, but describing a butterfly as fat is like - I've seen fat caterpillars, but I've never seen a fat butterfly (laughter). ALTIZER: Yeah, they are butterballs in the fall and winter. ZOMORODI: (Laughter). ALTIZER: And it's important that they build up those fat reserves because they not only need the energy to fuel the migration, but they have to live off of their fat reserves for five months at the overwintering sites and also use them to fuel that journey partway back north again. ZOMORODI: Here's Sonia Altizer on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)ALTIZER: Now, this migration of monarchs is one of the Earth's last great migrations. But around the world, a lot of these great migrations have disappeared or are disappearing due to things that we as people are doing to them and their habitats. Their loss has changed the entire ecology of ecosystems, and they're impossible to replace. Like these other migrations, monarch migration is declining, too. In fact, the last three consecutive years have been the lowest numbers of monarchs ever recorded in Mexico - so low, in fact, that scientists estimate migratory monarchs have declined by 90%. So if monarchs were people, this would be like losing every person living in the United States except for those in Ohio and Florida. Now, what are the causes of this monarch decline? Well, unfortunately, there's a lot of different challenges facing monarchs, ranging from climate change and drought to deforestation and illegal logging in in even car strikes along roads during the fall migration. One of the more ominous threats has been the loss of milkweed plants and agricultural habitats due to shifting agricultural practices. So it might surprise you to hear that what we eat affects food that's available to the monarchs. ZOMORODI: So you actually link the monarch's well-being to how we humans grow our food. Can you just explain what that link is, what the connection is between the two? ALTIZER: Well, so monarchs need milkweed. Milkweed isn't the only resource that they need. They also need nectar plants. But milkweed is the key resource that monarchs need to reproduce. And it's an agricultural weed. And so you would find it along roadsides, even country roads or gravel roads. It would be growing in and around cornfields, in and around other row crops and orchards. And so one thing that has become popular since the late 1990s are crops that are genetically modified to resist common herbicides, like Roundup. And the herbicides can be sprayed on crop fields of soybean or corn, and the crops do just fine, but milkweeds and other agricultural weeds that would be providing nectar for monarchs would die. ZOMORODI: So you suggest that one way to help stem the decline is to buy non-GMO food. But GMOs have been around for - what? - nearly 30 years now. Is that even possible anymore? ALTIZER: That's an interesting question. I mean, certainly, we can use our purchasing power as consumers to buy sustainably sourced crops or, you know, agriculture. So buy local. Buy organic. It's probably too late to turn the clock on GMO crops. And it is a controversial topic. So the technology itself isn't, you know, harmful or evil. It's just the way that these crops have been deployed and the scale at which they've been deployed. It means that we're growing food now in a way that doesn't leave room for other biodiversity. And so these agroecosystems have become, you know, really almost ecological deserts, if you will. ZOMORODI: So is there anything else we can do, like, I guess, plant monarch-friendly gardens, plant more milkweed? ALTIZER: Definitely planting milkweed but especially native milkweeds is something that people can do to help them. And you're - again, being aware that it's not just milkweeds that monarchs need. It's nectar plants and other resources, too. And if you plant habitats and gardens for monarchs and other pollinators, you'll be helping dozens of other species, as well. And so it's realizing that monarchs are part of these complicated food webs that involve birds and spiders and ants and other plant species, even parasites that attack them. And certainly, milkweed is a critical part of that, and there are other parts, too. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ALTIZER: You know, one of my dreams is to be able to take my kids to the overwintering sites in central Mexico to let them be able to see what it's like to stand in a forest full of millions of butterflies. And so to see that declining, to see those migrations unraveling does make me sad. At the same time, they are resilient, and they can acclimate or adapt to a wide range of conditions. And so they do exist in places in the world where they don't undergo long-distance migrations. So there are native resident monarch populations throughout Central and South America and the Caribbean islands. And monarchs more recently colonized the Pacific Islands. They've also recently crossed the Atlantic. ZOMORODI: They've crossed the Atlantic, like, literally, do you think? ALTIZER: Yes, they have. And so one interesting fact about monarchs is that in England, people used to call them storm fritillaries in historic times because they would occasionally blow over with big storms. ZOMORODI: Wow (laughter). ALTIZER: You know, people thought that they maybe naturally just blew across the Atlantic in storms. ZOMORODI: Yeah. ALTIZER: It also seems likely that monarchs have hitched a ride with people to different places around the world on trade ships, for example. But in a lot of these places, monarchs breed year-round and don't undergo long-distance migrations. And so how these tiny insects can show such a wide range of behavioral responses to different environments is fascinating to me. And so, you know, I think a lot of us are trying to figure out what's going to be the new normal. ZOMORODI: Yeah, I mean, the new normal sounds like it's not great for these butterflies. There's a lot we humans keep doing to cause problems for them. So does that mean that in addition to studying them, we also need to start enacting laws to protect them? ALTIZER: You know, one of the great challenges with protecting migratory species is that they don't see or respond to or respect geopolitical boundaries. And so we need to think about ways of engaging in conservation that cross these boundaries, which, you know, are really just artificial constructs of people and nations and really reflect on the fact that for most of life on Earth, movement is not only a part of their life. It's essential to the persistence of these species. ZOMORODI: That's Sonia Altizer. She's an ecologist at the University of Georgia.

MANOUSH ZOMORODI, HOST:   On the show today, migration. And up until now, we've been talking about human migration. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ZOMORODI: But, of course, humans aren't the only animals that migrate. SONIA ALTIZER: There are many hundreds, if not thousands of species of birds that migrate. ZOMORODI: There's caribou across Canada, wildebeest in Africa. ALTIZER: There are migratory fish, like salmon, and also a lot of marine animals migrate long distances, like sea turtles and whales. ZOMORODI: But right now, let's turn our attention to the humble but tenacious monarch butterfly. ALTIZER: I think of monarchs as the tanks of the butterfly world. ZOMORODI: (Laughter). ALTIZER: So they're small. They weigh only a half a gram, but they can travel thousands of kilometers in the wild. ZOMORODI: This is Sonia Altizer. ALTIZER: I'm an ecologist at the University of Georgia. So I study the ecology of animal migration. ZOMORODI: And Sonia says monarch butterflies are different because their migration is multigenerational. ALTIZER: So the same monarch never makes the journey twice.

I'm Manoush Zomorodi So a few years ago. . . CAROLYN FREIWALD: I was in my office here in Mississippi - it's in Oxford, northern Mississippi - and an archaeologist I work with came in and asked me if I wanted to help relocate a cemetery. ZOMORODI: This is Carolyn Freiwald. FREIWALD: Normally when someone asks you to move a body, you wonder, OK, when are the police going to show up? Or at least you should. ZOMORODI: But Carolyn wasn't worried because she is a bioarchaeologist. She finds clues from our past by studying our bones. FREIWALD: Because it sort of brings a person back to life - I kind of hope somebody studies my bones, if possible - when I'm dead, though. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ZOMORODI: That day, Carolyn was asked to examine the bones from an abandoned cemetery near Jackson, Miss. FREIWALD: The cemetery was last used about 100 years ago. ZOMORODI: Oh. FREIWALD: And it probably included a span of time of maybe the 1840s into the 1940s. And nobody had really been there for decades. And my role on the project was going to be to help study the people themselves, their skeletal remains, to see a little bit about how old they were, how they were buried, if they had health conditions or even what their lives were like. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ZOMORODI: Carolyn thought they'd uncover the remains of just a couple dozen bodies. But as it turns out. . . FREIWALD: It wasn't just 40 graves; it turned out to be more than 350. And so the cemetery was a lot bigger than we originally anticipated. So it turned out to be a really big job. But with all of those graves, 15% of the people buried in the cemetery had a name recorded either on a stone or perhaps in the historic records. And we wanted to try and understand who the other people were who had lived and died in that area. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ZOMORODI: So who were some of the people you found? Like, what do you know about them? FREIWALD: So we know that some of the people in the cemetery came from eastern states. So we have people whose gravestones say, for example, like Richard M. He was born in South Carolina, and we think that he came through Alabama and then decided to move his family and his household to Mississippi. Historic records show that he was a planter. And with him, he brought some of his family because we know there were other people with his last name in the cemetery. But we also know that he held 31 enslaved people. And it's pretty likely that he brought some or all of them along from South Carolina to Alabama to Mississippi to establish a plantation here. That also means that the Cherokee, the Chickasaw, the people who are living here, were forced out. So in a way, this is a snapshot of how the U. S. was formed. You have people who have European ancestry. You have people whose ancestors came from Africa. And we didn't expect to find that. I didn't expect to be able to study migration in Mississippi. But once we started to look at the people here to try and figure out who they were, that's what we found. More than, you know, 10 to 15% of the people who we were able to study in the cemetery weren't from Mississippi. They weren't born here. They came here from someplace else. So we're finding that instead of migration being an anomaly, that it's actually the norm. This is what people do. They move. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ZOMORODI: Migration is part of everyone's history, even if you've never traveled far. A hundred-thousand years ago, our early ancestors began moving within and then out of Africa, spreading across the globe. Since then, migration has shaped empires, countries and cultures, while debates over borders and who can and can't migrate continue to this day. And so on the show today, Migration, ideas about the search for a place to call home. For bioarchaeologist Carolyn Freiwald, our bodies tell our migration story. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)FREIWALD: I want you to think about the image that you see when I say one word - migrant. ZOMORODI: She continues from the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)FREIWALD: You may have pictured a crowded boat in rough waters, people clinging to the top of a freight train or crossing a desert wearing worn-out shoes. This is what we see in the news cycle 24 hours, day after day, story after story - people who are desperate, fleeing wars, fleeing climate change, fleeing poverty. But in reality, most people move for more common reasons - to get a good education, to find a job, to find family members or to fall in love. And this is nothing new. Archaeologists like me have been studying migration and finding that people, for hundreds and even thousands of years, have been moving around the globe, from Europe's earliest farmers to Vikings to pirates, Roman gladiators and even Neanderthal cavemen, people like you and me. Mobility is one of the things that makes us human. People move. And we know this because of something that you brought with you here tonight. You carry it with you to many places - to work, to the gym, to bed and even in the shower. It's not your cellphone; it's you. It's your body and your bones, all 206 of them - I brought mine - because your bones will tell the story of your life, even a single tooth. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ZOMORODI: OK. So how is it that a single tooth can tell the story of my life? FREIWALD: So, for example, if you have Native American or Asian ancestry, the shapes of your teeth, like your incisors, will be different than people whose ancestors came long back from Europe or from Africa. So if you take your tongue and run it along the back side of your teeth. . . ZOMORODI: OK. I'm doing it now. Hang on. Hang on. OK. Yeah, running it along. FREIWALD: If you feel just a flat shape, you may have some European ancestors. Yep. If you feel a little scoop shape, that can tell you that some of your ancestors originally came from Asia. And that can include, you know, having Indigenous ancestors here in the U. S. ZOMORODI: Huh. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)FREIWALD: If we go inside the tooth, so the pulp cavity, we may be able to extract the DNA and see if your ancestors came from Egypt or England or both. But we're not interested as much in your family's migration history as yours. And we're - that's where we go to the tooth enamel, what it's made out of, to try and find out if a person moved and even when they moved. And it's based on one simple idea - that you are what you eat. All the minerals and the elements in the food, like calcium, oxygen - which is the O in H2O - sodium and salt, can tell us something about your diet. So we know if you like cornbread or white bread, if you prefer pork, chicken or if you really like seafood. There are other elements that tell us where that food came from, and that includes sulfur, strontium, oxygen and even lead, which, of course, you don't want very much of. But these tell us where the food comes from, and that can tell us where you were when you were eating it. And that is what archaeologists use to identify ancient migration. ZOMORODI: That's fascinating. Do you think it would - would your work be done differently if you were studying the bones of migrants today? I mean, I guess, you know, my own parents are immigrants to the United States. I - you'd know about the flat - my flat front teeth (laughter). But like, would you know that I - it's embarrassing to say, but I had, like, vitamin D gummies yesterday and that this morning I had, like, five cups of coffee? Would you be able to tell? FREIWALD: Well, you can think of - all right. Your body tells stories in lots of ways. So with modern people, you can look at your teeth. Your teeth formed during childhood. Your bones are forming continuously. So if I stop for a second. . . (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)FREIWALD: . . . You just formed some new bone cells. So they'll contain records of different things at different parts of your life. And think - you know, your hair grows pretty fast. So with, say, an inch of hair growth, you might have a snapshot of a month of your life. So scientists can actually do things like look for extreme stress and malnutrition that's recorded by some of the elements. If you had a change in your diet from a major food source - let's say you grew up eating meat, and then you decided that you wanted to be a vegan or vegetarian for a while, we could eventually see those changes if you were willing to volunteer a bit of your bone or hair. But figuring out where someone comes from, that's tricky because think about your food. If you wrote down what you ate in the past 24 hours, there's probably not much of it that came from where you're living right now. ZOMORODI: Right. FREIWALD: Bottled water, you know, Fritos, whatever your favorite snacks are - it might - we might be able to look at combinations of food because people are doing that to try and understand missing persons and migrants today, in particular, the problems of people crossing the southern U. S. border. A lot of times when they don't make it, they don't have ID with them anymore. The desert's a rough place. So we're trying to understand where they came from to get at who they were. And it becomes really tricky. But we're trying to understand how to use these technologies to bring the people back home. ZOMORODI: Oh, that's unbelievable. And I guess I'm wondering that now that you have this technology at your disposal, is it common to examine a person's bones and find that they come from somewhere else? FREIWALD: Yeah. That's one of the things that we found with sort of these new technologies, especially with the advent of DNA and being able to look inside people's bones, not just at the shapes of their bones, is that people in the past thought that, you know, societies like the ancient Romans, they would write about the census, who lived in their cities. And they were pretty cosmopolitan areas. But in other places, especially going farther back in time, we didn't think people could move, or we didn't think they moved that much. But now people are doing studies around the world from Mesoamerica, the Aztecs, the people who are living in North America. All across time and across space, we're finding immigrants. And sometimes you couldn't differentiate them. You'd have a person who was born locally and a person who migrated into the town buried right next to each other, the same way that you'd treat family. ZOMORODI: Huh. So do you think movement is a human thing, a mammal thing, a living being thing? Like, do we just - is movement just inherent? FREIWALD: It must be. I mean, I don't know if you can always know what people's motivations are. But if we think about, we can go way back in deep time that all of us - all of our families have a migration story, one that we don't think about because humans actually originated in Africa. And at some point, they started to move following - maybe following the animals they hunted, maybe out of curiosity. We don't know. But pretty soon they're moving into the Middle East. Some people went over to Asia. Some moved up into Europe. And over thousands of thousands of years, they got to the Americas. We've even got to Antarctica now. And people are talking about the moon and Mars. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)FREIWALD: When I think of migrant, I think about what the people say about, why did you move? And if you look, for example, at the migrants in Africa trying to come to Europe, some of them talk about this thing like a hunger. But they don't mean they're hungry. They mean it's a hunger. It's a hope. They want to see, you know, what's better, what's life. It's a curiosity. It's an adventure. These are the modern-day explorers. I don't think of Christopher Columbus. I think of the people today who are taking the risk of going. Maybe it's across an ocean; maybe it's across a river, across a small road, or maybe it's just a community that's new that's only 10 miles away from where they grew up. These are the people who are - I think of when I think of migrants. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ZOMORODI: That's Carolyn Freiwald. She's a bioarchaeologist, and you can see her full talk at ted. com. On the show today, ideas about the search for a place to call home. I'm Manoush Zomorodi, and you're listening to the TED Radio Hour from NPR. Stay with us. MANOUSH ZOMORODI, HOST:   It's the TED Radio Hour from NPR. I'm Manoush Zomorodi So a few years ago. . . CAROLYN FREIWALD: I was in my office here in Mississippi - it's in Oxford, northern Mississippi - and an archaeologist I work with came in and asked me if I wanted to help relocate a cemetery. ZOMORODI: This is Carolyn Freiwald. FREIWALD: Normally when someone asks you to move a body, you wonder, OK, when are the police going to show up? Or at least you should. ZOMORODI: But Carolyn wasn't worried because she is a bioarchaeologist. She finds clues from our past by studying our bones. FREIWALD: Because it sort of brings a person back to life - I kind of hope somebody studies my bones, if possible - when I'm dead, though. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ZOMORODI: That day, Carolyn was asked to examine the bones from an abandoned cemetery near Jackson, Miss. FREIWALD: The cemetery was last used about 100 years ago. ZOMORODI: Oh. FREIWALD: And it probably included a span of time of maybe the 1840s into the 1940s. And nobody had really been there for decades. And my role on the project was going to be to help study the people themselves, their skeletal remains, to see a little bit about how old they were, how they were buried, if they had health conditions or even what their lives were like. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ZOMORODI: Carolyn thought they'd uncover the remains of just a couple dozen bodies. But as it turns out. . . FREIWALD: It wasn't just 40 graves; it turned out to be more than 350. And so the cemetery was a lot bigger than we originally anticipated. So it turned out to be a really big job. But with all of those graves, 15% of the people buried in the cemetery had a name recorded either on a stone or perhaps in the historic records. And we wanted to try and understand who the other people were who had lived and died in that area. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ZOMORODI: So who were some of the people you found? Like, what do you know about them? FREIWALD: So we know that some of the people in the cemetery came from eastern states. So we have people whose gravestones say, for example, like Richard M. He was born in South Carolina, and we think that he came through Alabama and then decided to move his family and his household to Mississippi. Historic records show that he was a planter. And with him, he brought some of his family because we know there were other people with his last name in the cemetery. But we also know that he held 31 enslaved people. And it's pretty likely that he brought some or all of them along from South Carolina to Alabama to Mississippi to establish a plantation here. That also means that the Cherokee, the Chickasaw, the people who are living here, were forced out. So in a way, this is a snapshot of how the U. S. was formed. You have people who have European ancestry. You have people whose ancestors came from Africa. And we didn't expect to find that. I didn't expect to be able to study migration in Mississippi. But once we started to look at the people here to try and figure out who they were, that's what we found. More than, you know, 10 to 15% of the people who we were able to study in the cemetery weren't from Mississippi. They weren't born here. They came here from someplace else. So we're finding that instead of migration being an anomaly, that it's actually the norm. This is what people do. They move. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ZOMORODI: Migration is part of everyone's history, even if you've never traveled far. A hundred-thousand years ago, our early ancestors began moving within and then out of Africa, spreading across the globe. Since then, migration has shaped empires, countries and cultures, while debates over borders and who can and can't migrate continue to this day. And so on the show today, Migration, ideas about the search for a place to call home. For bioarchaeologist Carolyn Freiwald, our bodies tell our migration story. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) FREIWALD: I want you to think about the image that you see when I say one word - migrant. ZOMORODI: She continues from the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) FREIWALD: You may have pictured a crowded boat in rough waters, people clinging to the top of a freight train or crossing a desert wearing worn-out shoes. This is what we see in the news cycle 24 hours, day after day, story after story - people who are desperate, fleeing wars, fleeing climate change, fleeing poverty. But in reality, most people move for more common reasons - to get a good education, to find a job, to find family members or to fall in love. And this is nothing new. Archaeologists like me have been studying migration and finding that people, for hundreds and even thousands of years, have been moving around the globe, from Europe's earliest farmers to Vikings to pirates, Roman gladiators and even Neanderthal cavemen, people like you and me. Mobility is one of the things that makes us human. People move. And we know this because of something that you brought with you here tonight. You carry it with you to many places - to work, to the gym, to bed and even in the shower. It's not your cellphone; it's you. It's your body and your bones, all 206 of them - I brought mine - because your bones will tell the story of your life, even a single tooth. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ZOMORODI: OK. So how is it that a single tooth can tell the story of my life? FREIWALD: So, for example, if you have Native American or Asian ancestry, the shapes of your teeth, like your incisors, will be different than people whose ancestors came long back from Europe or from Africa. So if you take your tongue and run it along the back side of your teeth. . . ZOMORODI: OK. I'm doing it now. Hang on. Hang on. OK. Yeah, running it along. FREIWALD: If you feel just a flat shape, you may have some European ancestors. Yep. If you feel a little scoop shape, that can tell you that some of your ancestors originally came from Asia. And that can include, you know, having Indigenous ancestors here in the U. S. ZOMORODI: Huh. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) FREIWALD: If we go inside the tooth, so the pulp cavity, we may be able to extract the DNA and see if your ancestors came from Egypt or England or both. But we're not interested as much in your family's migration history as yours. And we're - that's where we go to the tooth enamel, what it's made out of, to try and find out if a person moved and even when they moved. And it's based on one simple idea - that you are what you eat. All the minerals and the elements in the food, like calcium, oxygen - which is the O in H2O - sodium and salt, can tell us something about your diet. So we know if you like cornbread or white bread, if you prefer pork, chicken or if you really like seafood. There are other elements that tell us where that food came from, and that includes sulfur, strontium, oxygen and even lead, which, of course, you don't want very much of. But these tell us where the food comes from, and that can tell us where you were when you were eating it. And that is what archaeologists use to identify ancient migration. ZOMORODI: That's fascinating. Do you think it would - would your work be done differently if you were studying the bones of migrants today? I mean, I guess, you know, my own parents are immigrants to the United States. I - you'd know about the flat - my flat front teeth (laughter). But like, would you know that I - it's embarrassing to say, but I had, like, vitamin D gummies yesterday and that this morning I had, like, five cups of coffee? Would you be able to tell? FREIWALD: Well, you can think of - all right. Your body tells stories in lots of ways. So with modern people, you can look at your teeth. Your teeth formed during childhood. Your bones are forming continuously. So if I stop for a second. . . (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) FREIWALD: . . . You just formed some new bone cells. So they'll contain records of different things at different parts of your life. And think - you know, your hair grows pretty fast. So with, say, an inch of hair growth, you might have a snapshot of a month of your life. So scientists can actually do things like look for extreme stress and malnutrition that's recorded by some of the elements. If you had a change in your diet from a major food source - let's say you grew up eating meat, and then you decided that you wanted to be a vegan or vegetarian for a while, we could eventually see those changes if you were willing to volunteer a bit of your bone or hair. But figuring out where someone comes from, that's tricky because think about your food. If you wrote down what you ate in the past 24 hours, there's probably not much of it that came from where you're living right now. ZOMORODI: Right. FREIWALD: Bottled water, you know, Fritos, whatever your favorite snacks are - it might - we might be able to look at combinations of food because people are doing that to try and understand missing persons and migrants today, in particular, the problems of people crossing the southern U. S. border. A lot of times when they don't make it, they don't have ID with them anymore. The desert's a rough place. So we're trying to understand where they came from to get at who they were. And it becomes really tricky. But we're trying to understand how to use these technologies to bring the people back home. ZOMORODI: Oh, that's unbelievable. And I guess I'm wondering that now that you have this technology at your disposal, is it common to examine a person's bones and find that they come from somewhere else? FREIWALD: Yeah. That's one of the things that we found with sort of these new technologies, especially with the advent of DNA and being able to look inside people's bones, not just at the shapes of their bones, is that people in the past thought that, you know, societies like the ancient Romans, they would write about the census, who lived in their cities. And they were pretty cosmopolitan areas. But in other places, especially going farther back in time, we didn't think people could move, or we didn't think they moved that much. But now people are doing studies around the world from Mesoamerica, the Aztecs, the people who are living in North America. All across time and across space, we're finding immigrants. And sometimes you couldn't differentiate them. You'd have a person who was born locally and a person who migrated into the town buried right next to each other, the same way that you'd treat family. ZOMORODI: Huh. So do you think movement is a human thing, a mammal thing, a living being thing? Like, do we just - is movement just inherent? FREIWALD: It must be. I mean, I don't know if you can always know what people's motivations are. But if we think about, we can go way back in deep time that all of us - all of our families have a migration story, one that we don't think about because humans actually originated in Africa.

A recent report from the House Science Committee found that, at the federal agency that leads basic climate research, there are more than eight times as many male engineers as female engineers. The racial demographics are even more dismal. Federal scientists are still overwhelmingly white. Black scientists are particularly underrepresented. That's a big problem for an administration that says it wants to correct health disparities and reduce greenhouse gas emissions in ways that address systemic racism. ANTONIO BAINES: The more folks at the table doing science, hopefully the quicker we'll find cures for the cancer and diseases and make a better environment for all of us. HERSHER: Antonio Baines is a toxicologist and pharmacologist at North Carolina Central University, a historically Black institution. He has advised thousands of young scientists over the years. But federal government jobs aren't always an obvious choice. BAINES: I think students don't always know what they can do with their degrees. And the federal government can be a black box. HERSHER: Baines wants those jobs to be seen as viable options. He's invited the heads of science agencies to guest lecture and arranged for students to shadow federal scientists. Tia Tate is a 30-year-old computational biologist. She flew through undergrad, masters and Ph. D. programs studying health disparities. All of her degrees have been from HBCUs. TIA TATE: I feel like having graduated from, like, these historically Black colleges and universities really kind of gives me a sense of pride in self - for myself and my people and encouraged me to continue to work for my communities. HERSHER: But as a Black woman in science, Tate says she also felt unsure sometimes about where she fit. TATE: So, you know, I felt like an imposter at one point, but. . . HERSHER: Like she didn't belong. She knew she was excellent at math and biology, but there was still a nagging fear that she might not be able to compete in academia or government. TATE: I kind of felt like, OK, can I hold my own to these people that went to these prestigious universities where, you know, the funding was limitless and, you know, they had opportunities that I didn't necessarily - didn't have? And so I had continued to tell myself, you know, I am qualified. I'm not here just because of affirmative action. I hate that term. HERSHER: Tate also had a mentor in her Ph.

Coastal cities use it to protect themselves from rising seas by building levees and restoring marshes. But supplies are getting tight, as NPR's Lauren Sommer reports. LAUREN SOMMER, BYLINE: There's a name for Pat Mapelli's job, a name he's not really a fan of. He's considered a dirt broker. PAT MAPELLI: I hate that name. I'll be honest with you. Dirt just has that negative connotation. You know, you got to go wash up, right? SOMMER: Because what Mapelli handles is in high demand. He works for the construction materials company Graniterock. And he gets a lot of phone calls about dirt. MAPELLI: Oh, the demand is way beyond what the supply is. SOMMER: We're walking on top of one of the deals that Mapelli brokered. It's an earthen levee on the shores of San Francisco Bay, one that helps protect hundreds of thousands of people. Over the years, waves and weather have worn it down. MAPELLI: It's very much lower than it should be right now. SOMMER: It needs more dirt, and a lot of it - 1 million cubic yards for the levees in this area. That's 100,000 dump trucks. So Mapelli is a matchmaker. He finds people who need to get rid of dirt, like a construction project that's digging an underground parking garage, and he finds a way to get that dirt to the shoreline. With sea level rise, the need for that is only going up. LETITIA GRENIER: How do we get people to see that we're on the precipice of a huge crisis? SOMMER: Letitia Grenier is a senior scientist at the San Francisco Estuary Institute, an ecological science group. We're standing next to a marsh that's a magnet for wildlife. GRENIER: Right now, we're looking at water birds from basically all over the Western Hemisphere. SOMMER: This muddy stretch of low-lying plants is also a barrier against the water. GRENIER: These marshes are knocking down the waves. They're absorbing the water. And they're really helping create flood risk management along the shore, which is critical for many billions of dollars of infrastructure, as well as neighborhoods and other communities along the shoreline. SOMMER: Grenier says about 90% of the bay's marshes have been filled in. A lot need to be restored to protect the shoreline from rising seas, which could go up between 3 and 6 feet by the end of the century. But even after they get restored, the marshes will still need mud to keep up with sea level rise. The muddy water that comes in with every tide helps build it up. GRENIER: If the wetlands don't have that, they basically drown. They get lower and lower relative to how high the water is. SOMMER: Grenier and her colleagues found that San Francisco Bay will likely need more than 500 million metric tons of sediment by the end of the century to deal with climate change. The natural supply will fall short of that, only one-third to one-half of what's needed. But there is a potential source of mud just nearby. Every year, thousands of ships come into San Francisco Bay following navigation channels. The federal Army Corps of Engineers is responsible for dredging them, collecting millions of cubic yards of mud every year. Tessa Beach, who works at the Corps' San Francisco district, says they do get requests to use that mud for restoration projects. TESSA BEACH: I don't disagree. I think, you know, dredge material should be viewed as a really valuable commodity in that regard. SOMMER: But she says federal rules require them to pick the cheapest option to get rid of it, which usually means just dumping it, often out in the Pacific Ocean. AMY HUTZEL: It is frustrating that this has been decades of trying to solve this problem. SOMMER: Amy Hutzel is with the California Coastal Conservancy, a state agency that works on restoration. She says the only way for states to get this dredged mud is to pay the extra cost of moving it. Dumping it may be cheaper, but that ignores the longer-term benefits of preventing flooding, she says. HUTZEL: So we're just going to be seeing erosion of our shorelines and mudflats and marshes unless we start doing things differently with sediment. SOMMER: That could be changing soon. Last year, Congress passed a law that told the Army Corps of Engineers to consider the environmental benefits of using mud, including to prepare for climate change. The agency says it plans to release new rules on using mud by August. Lauren Sommer, NPR News. SCOTT SIMON, HOST:   As the climate gets warmer, dirt is becoming a hot commodity.

AMY HUTZEL: It is frustrating that this has been decades of trying to solve this problem. SOMMER: Amy Hutzel is with the California Coastal Conservancy, a state agency that works on restoration. She says the only way for states to get this dredged mud is to pay the extra cost of moving it. Dumping it may be cheaper, but that ignores the longer-term benefits of preventing flooding, she says. HUTZEL: So we're just going to be seeing erosion of our shorelines and mudflats and marshes unless we start doing things differently with sediment. SOMMER: That could be changing soon. Last year, Congress passed a law that told the Army Corps of Engineers to consider the environmental benefits of using mud, including to prepare for climate change. The agency says it plans to release new rules on using mud by August. Lauren Sommer, NPR News.", "section": "Science", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2021 NPR.  All rights reserved.

And one example is an organic megafarm in South Dakota backed by the company General Mills, maker of Cheerios. Some of the farm's neighbors are accusing the farm of doing more harm than good. NPR's Dan Charles has the story. DAN CHARLES, BYLINE: Gunsmoke Farms is huge. It covers 53 square miles near Pierre, S. D. An investment fund based in San Francisco and Texas bought it a few years ago. And General Mills announced it would help convert it to organic farming with the help of Gary Zimmer, an organic expert from Wisconsin. GARY ZIMMER: My job as a soil consultant was to get those soils rich. We were going to fix the soil. And it was going to be quite a large investment. General Mills even took some soil to California to some show (ph) to see what it looked like today and what it was going to look like when we got done. CHARLES: But in South Dakota, some were skeptical that it could work, including Dwayne Beck, a soil scientist who runs an agricultural research station for South Dakota State University, 40 miles east of Gunsmoke Farms. DWAYNE BECK: It scared me because normally, organic entails using lots of tillage. And these soils are very fragile. CHARLES: Farmers often till soil, stir it up with tools like chisel plows or disks to clear weeds and get land ready for planting. But Beck says tillage is destructive, especially where Gunsmoke Farms sits, where it's dry and the soil is full of clay. D BECK: Once you disturb it, nothing holds that soil together. It just turns into powder. CHARLES: It can wash away or blow away, which used to happen all the time. There were dust storms so thick cars crashed because drivers couldn't see, so most farmers in this area cut way back on their tillage. Instead, they use planting equipment that slices right into undisturbed land and places the seed into the ground. D BECK: We'd prefer to not touch the soil at all if we can get by with it, but we have to have some way to put the seed in there. CHARLES: To control the weeds, they use herbicides. But herbicides are not an option for Gunsmoke Farms, being organic. And last year, to get ready for its first crops of wheat and peas, those enormous fields were tilled. And Dwayne Beck says his fears were realized. He sent me some pictures. D BECK: Yeah, that's just another picture of soil in the ditch. That's supposed to be green grass. CHARLES: It's covered by a small drift of windblown dirt. In another photo, a country road disappears into a cloud of dust. D BECK: That soil that blew out of there, it will never be the same as it was before it blew. CHARLES: It won't have the stability and structure of healthy soil held together by the roots of plants. When Gunsmoke Farms was just starting, experts from the U. S. Department of Agriculture drew up a soil conservation plan for the farm. They wanted wide strips of permanent native grasses crossing the fields and crops you don't have to plant every year on the steepest hillsides. Gary Zimmer, the soil consultant, says that was part of his original plan. But new farm managers took over and never followed through. ZIMMER: Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. It's in a deep hole. I don't know how you get it back out organically. It's hard to farm organically if you do it really well and you got your intensive management. But 30,000 acres poorly managed is a really good sign for failure. CHARLES: General Mills said in a statement that turning Gunsmoke Farms into a thriving ecosystem is a journey, and it promised continued efforts to minimize erosion and improve soil health there. The investment firm that owns the farm, Sixth Street Partners, said in its statement that the farm is early in the process and that its mission, organic farming, also provides benefits like reduced use of pesticides and synthetic fertilizer. Ruth Beck, who's married to Dwayne Beck, used to work for South Dakota State University, advising farmers in this area. She says it's just really hard to grow crops organically on a large scale in this part of the country.

Truth is that season is now so long, we're almost never out of it. 2020 featured one of the most destructive wildfire seasons in modern history. And in 2021, a widening drought is creating conditions that are even worse. Here's NPR's Eric Westervelt. ERIC WESTERVELT, BYLINE: In late September, the fast-moving Glass Fire badly damaged nearly 30 Napa wineries, including family-owned Hourglass Wines. It swept through as the region was still recovering from 2017's record-setting fires. Hourglass' winemaking building is a total loss. Steel fermentation and storage tanks sit like sad, damaged sculptures. Most of the 2020 vintage is still inside, cooked and lost. Founder and president Jeff Smith walks past a pile of fire-scarred stones. JEFF SMITH: Yeah, that was all remnants of the old farmhouse. WESTERVELT: The winery's guesthouse, built in 1852. Smith says the hardest loss, in fact, was the grove of redwood, Doug fir, oak and olive trees even older than the house, most of which now lie burnt and stacked for salvage. SMITH: Yeah, that was - to me, that was the soul of the property, those trees. And that's the heartbreak of this for us. The buildings can be rebuilt, but the couple-hundred-year-old trees, you know, you can't just magically bring those right back. WESTERVELT: The Glass Fire was just one of nearly 10,000 California wildfires last year that burned more than 4 million acres, a modern record. Fires destroyed more than 10,000 structures. And the prospect for this fire season. . . CRAIG CLEMENTS: I think California's looking worse this year than in 2020 because of the severe drought. WESTERVELT: That's Craig Clements, director of the Wildfire Interdisciplinary Research Center at San Jose State. He says California's drought, with anemic winter rain and snowfalls, has left wildfire fuels in parts of California at or near record levels of dryness. CLEMENTS: What we found is that the fuel moisture - so this is the amount of water inside the living plant - that amount of water is the lowest that we've recorded at these sites since 2013. And so it's indicative of very dangerous conditions coming into this summer. WESTERVELT: Those dangerous conditions are the result of drier, hotter weather due to a warming climate combined with more than a century of fire suppression that's left many forests with treacherous amounts of built-up fuel. Vegetation across big parts of California are already looking stressed and dried. Stream flows and reservoir levels are down significantly, and all of that could be worsened by predicted warmer-than-normal temperatures, says Amanda Sheffield with NOAA's National Integrated Drought Information System. AMANDA SHEFFIELD: Summer temperatures are forecasted by the National Weather Service to be above normal again all across the West, including California. When you combine dry, hot, windy weather with dried-out vegetation from drought, you can definitely see potential for large-scale fires. WESTERVELT: But that's a forecast some in pandemic-battered California may not want to hear. Today in picturesque Calistoga in Napa County, tourists are returning in droves, more than ready for a post-lockdown generous pour and to take in the beautiful, if fire-scarred landscape. But Calistoga, like a handful of other cities, has already imposed emergency water restrictions because of the drought. So Mayor Chris Canning has to balance boosterism with realism. CHRIS CANNING: We've been a city since 1862. In our entire history since then, we've only been evacuated twice. And both of those times have been in the last four years as a direct result of wildfire - not a good resume for a mayor 'cause both were under my watch, but absolutely necessary for the safety and protection of our residents. WESTERVELT: To get a jump on any fires this season, Canning is pleased the state agency Cal Fire has dedicated a new firefighting helicopter and a 24/7 firefighting crew for Napa County. And the mayor says most of the region's residents get it. They're building bigger firebreaks, making a plan and clearing brush on their properties. But Canning admits, that's not everyone. CANNING: The other school of thought is, let's pretend, you know, what happened in the past is the past; it'll never happen again. The amnesia response is problematic, especially if you're not taking the precautions you need to, as a business or a resident, to be prepared. That's where it's dangerous. WESTERVELT: Back at Napa's Hourglass Winery, owner Jeff Smith says the more frequent, more destructive wildfires have him rethinking everything about how he manages his land and business as he examines how to rebuild stronger and smarter. SMITH: You know, I grew up here. All of my roots are here. And it's my intention to stay and rebuild. But I think that there's a lot of game-changing thought processes that we need to be going through. And we're taking a much harder look at materials, at defensible space, at fire suppression systems, access - you know, all of these kinds of things to try to mitigate this into the future. WESTERVELT: And Smith is hopeful. He plans to rebuild enough this summer to crush and process this year's grape harvest in a new facility here in September. At least that's the plan.

(SOUNDBITE OF COIN SPINNING)JULIA SIMON, HOST:  Early last year, the CEO of Microsoft got onstage at Microsoft headquarters. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Please welcome Satya Nadella. AMANDA ARONCZYK, HOST:  He walks on and stands facing the crowd. Behind him, there's this wall covered with these healthy-looking green leaves. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)SATYA NADELLA: Thank you so very much. It's fantastic to be here today. SIMON: It kind of looks like a TED Talk crossed with a product announcement. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)NADELLA: As corporations, our purpose and actions must be aligned to helping solve the world's problems, not create new ones. ARONCZYK: And then he gets to Microsoft's new pledge - to fight climate change. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)NADELLA: Today, we're making the commitment that by 2030, Microsoft will be carbon negative. ARONCZYK: Carbon negative - what does that even mean? Microsoft has offices around the world that use lots of electricity. They have fleets of cars and trucks, data centers that use diesel. All of those things mean carbon emissions. SIMON: But somehow, the CEO of Microsoft is saying his company's going to eliminate all those carbon emissions - even better, reverse them. ARONCZYK: Their plan? The answer, in part, has to do with what's displayed on the screen above him - images of giant pristine forests. SIMON: Forests, trees - these are not just nice nature images. Trees are going to solve some serious climate accounting problems for Microsoft. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)NADELLA: This is the decade to take bold steps forward to address our most pressing challenges. Thank you. (APPLAUSE)ARONCZYK: One-fifth of the world's largest companies have made pledges like this one to reduce their carbon footprint to zero or beyond. They've done the math and decided that they can do this in part by paying someone across the world to save trees - which, really, is that really how we're going to do this? (SOUNDBITE OF MAXIME PINTO'S \"CHINESE GANG\")SIMON: Hello, and welcome to PLANET MONEY. I'm Julia Simon. ARONCZYK: And I'm Amanda Aronczyk. Behind every carbon neutral or carbon negative pledge, there's some math that companies can continue polluting as long as they're offsetting it somewhere else. SIMON: Today on the show, does the tree math add up? And if it doesn't, what's that mean for just the biggest problem humanity's ever faced? (SOUNDBITE OF MAXIME PINTO'S \"CHINESE GANG\")SIMON: The logic of how a major carbon-emitting company can fight climate change by saving trees halfway around the world is kind of a journey. So today, we're going to take you through the steps, introduce you to the key players - the forest boss, the stamp of approval guy and the broker. ARONCZYK: First up, the forest boss. DHARSONO HARTONO: My name is Dharsono Hartono. SIMON: Dharsono controls one of the biggest forests in Indonesia. HARTONO: Just to give an idea of how big the area is, it's actually twice the size of New York. SIMON: So New York, the island, or Manhattan or? HARTONO: New York - New York - New York including the five boroughs. SIMON: Oh, all the - whoa, all the boroughs. Dharsono's journey to becoming a forest boss starts in 2007. He was in his early 30s, and he was at this conference in Bali. He goes to a lot of conferences. He has a lot of those cool silk batik shirts. ARONCZYK: And he had just moved back to Indonesia after working on Wall Street. And he's looking for his next big business thing, which is why he's at this conference. It's a palm oil conference. SIMON: Palm oil is one of Indonesia's largest exports. It's in everything. It's in your Nutella, in your Cheez-Its. It's in your soap. People cook with it. It's also pretty bad for the environment, leads to a lot of deforestation. So you were thinking that you would do what exactly in palm oil? HARTONO: I would basically do - to own a plantation at that time, right? SIMON: OK. While he's in Bali, he runs into an old college bud. ARONCZYK: And his buddy's like, dude, palm oil is so 2000-and-late. You got to look at the future. You got to get into the triple P. HARTONO: He was, like, saying, Dharsono, you have to do this triple P. SIMON: What did he mean (laughter)? HARTONO: I was like, what do you mean like triple P? There's this new business where technically you can save the planet, you can save the people and you can make profit. So it's a triple P. ARONCZYK: Dharsono's buddy's like, the profit is in the trees. You and I, we should start a business together. We're going to protect our forests - our Indonesian forests. SIMON: And Dharsono's like, I get that. Let the forest grow. The land becomes more valuable. A few years later, we can flip the forest, sell it for a profit. HARTONO: I was thinking of maybe this is just like real estate, right? You own something. You haul it for a long time, and you're going to make money. That's just the naive thinking of Dharsono in 2007. SIMON: (Laughter) Yeah. ARONCZYK: Dharsono's buddy is like, no, no, no, no. This is not about real estate. This is about climate change. Hear me out. In order to slow climate change, we - you know, everybody, whatever, the world - need to reduce our carbon emissions to nearly zero, and that includes big companies. But you know what's really hard when you're a big company? Reducing your emissions to zero. SIMON: This right here is the key reason why there's a business opportunity in Indonesia's massive forests. See, trees - they're kind of incredible. They suck carbon out of the air and store it, which is why companies will pay Indonesians to keep forests standing rather than let them get clear-cut. ARONCZYK: These payments are called offsets, as in, sure, we companies are emitting carbon into the atmosphere at home, but that's cool because those emissions are offset by that forest we're protecting in Indonesia. HARTONO: This area would have been deforested. Without our intervention, the area will be converted into pulp and paper. ARONCZYK: Pulp and paper - they would just cut down all the trees, deforesting the area. So Dharsono's buddy says, instead, let's preserve the forest. SIMON: Dharsono's like, yeah. He's convinced there's a business opportunity here, and he can help save the people and the planet through forests. He's not going to go into palm oil. ARONCZYK: Dharsono and his buddy start doing research. They have to figure out where the most desirable carbon-rich forests are. There are a few that they look at. None are perfect. But then. . . HARTONO: Then I remember, oh, yeah, there's this area that I know of, which is a peatland area in Sintang, Kalimantan. Should we go there? So it's like, OK, let's do it, right? SIMON: Dharsono and his buddy get to the area, and it's beautiful, a swampy forest home to orangutans and clouded leopards, absolutely full of carbon - totally worth preserving. ARONCZYK: This was the spot. Eventually, this project went on to become what might be the largest of its kind in the world, but that took a number of years. They had to get the rights to the land, which was really complicated. In 2013, they finally got them. And then they formally start working with local communities to protect the forest. SIMON: This all costs a lot. And Dharsono - he wants to make a profit. He needs customers. But before companies will give him money to save the trees, he's got to prove that he's really saving them. To do that, he needs to go to the stamp of approval guy. Do you know Dharsono Hartono? DAVID ANTONIOLI: Yes, I do. SIMON: He needs to go to David Antonioli. ANTONIOLI: I'm the chief executive officer of Verra. ARONCZYK: David's nonprofit, Verra, validates forest projects like Dharsono's to make sure that they're taking as much carbon out of the atmosphere as they say they are. ANTONIOLI: We're a standard setter. So we spend all of our time developing the rules and the procedures, the standard, that project developers like Dharsono and others need to follow. SIMON: So somebody like Dharsono comes to Verra, and he's like, hey, I have this forest. It's gorgeous, carbon rich. I'm saving it from being destroyed, and I want to get paid for it. ARONCZYK: And Verra is like, sure, but you need to prove all that. Get some auditors on your land so that they can check it out. ANTONIOLI: You can't just hire any old auditor. It has to be an auditor that's accredited properly, which means they have the right training, they've got the right procedures in place to deal with conflicts of interest, and they can do the job. SIMON: Aside from overseeing the auditors, basically Verra has to find out, are these projects working? Are they living up to their promises? The whole process of getting verified can take years, but the Verra stamp of approval is worth it. ARONCZYK: Because after a forest boss gets a Verra stamp of approval, they now have something they can sell. Verra has certified, this project takes this many tons of CO2 out of the atmosphere. And for each ton of CO2 reduction, Verra issues one credit. This is a currency of this world, what they call a verified carbon unit. These are the offsets that companies will pay someone like Dharsono good money for. SIMON: But Dharsono doesn't have the connections to sell these verified carbon units to big companies, which brings us to the third and final link of the offset chain, the broker. DIEGO SAEZ GIL: My name is Diego Saez Gil, and I am co-founder and CEO of Pachama. SIMON: Diego's startup, Pachama - it's who companies go to when they want to buy verified carbon units. ARONCZYK: Now, his startup is relatively new, but it's attracted a lot of big-name investors - Bill Gates' climate fund, Amazon. SAEZ GIL: Serena Williams, the tennis player, who we are big fans of. SIMON: Who isn't? ARONCZYK: Part of why Silicon Valley investors love Diego is that he talks to them in a language that they understand. SAEZ GIL: In a way, we are a marketplace, like Airbnb, connecting supply and demand. SIMON: It's like Airbnb, but for offsets. So I click it. SAEZ GIL: Yes. SIMON: If I'm a company and I go on Diego's website, I can look for a forest. The company monitors these forests with satellite images and AI. I want it to zoom. Oh, there it goes, zooming in to Brazil. SAEZ GIL: Yeah. SIMON: Oh, in the center of Brazil - ooh, ooh. SAEZ GIL: Yeah. SIMON: Big zoom. Next to the map, there's a description of a forest project. I can see how many verified carbon units it's generated. There's a verification report by Verra, some photos. Oh, I see a river. I am seeing trees. SAEZ GIL: You can see the trees. This is a very. . . SIMON: Jesus. Wow. SAEZ GIL: It's a very dense area of the Amazon rainforest. You can see the shape of a triangle. SIMON: A triangle. SAEZ GIL: Yes. That is the borders of the area that is being conserved. SIMON: If I'm a company, I can choose to protect this forest. I can buy some verified carbon units and get closer to my carbon negative pledge. ARONCZYK: And that is the carbon offset chain. Usually, the company pays the forest boss, who has paid the stamp of approval guy, and then the broker also gets paid for hooking the whole thing up. And in the process, the planet is saved from climate change. SIMON: Or is it? That's after the break. (SOUNDBITE OF MAXIME PINTO'S \"ROOKIE BOOM BAP\")SIMON: There's a woman who spends her nights thinking about the thorny questions around carbon offset. Her name - Freya Chay. Her home base - Santa Cruz. Are you, like, in the watery part or the forest-y part? (LAUGHTER)FREYA CHAY: Critical question. I can usually see a little slice of ocean, but today it's really foggy. ARONCZYK: Freya works with a climate change research group called CarbonPlan, and they focus on transparency and integrity of climate change solutions. Her job involves analyzing offsets that are being sold on the market. SIMON: Last year, Freya's group heard about Microsoft's new pledge to go carbon negative, the one we talked about at the beginning of the show. ARONCZYK: And after Microsoft made the announcement, they were also like, we need your help; send us proposals. So a bunch of companies, including Pachama, the broker, they all pitched Microsoft with their best ideas. SIMON: Microsoft knew Freya's team and knew they had expertise in evaluating these types of proposals. So Microsoft is like, we'll give you early access to this info. And Freya's team says, cool, we'll vet it. Microsoft provides some funding to CarbonPlan. ARONCZYK: Also to NPR. Anyway, Freya starts digging into the proposals one by one, all 189 of them. CHAY: The day-to-day process is take a project, go look for literally any piece of information you can find on it, and then try to synthesize the important bits. SIMON: She goes on the web to see what's out there. She looks for reports from the stamp of approval guys, the brokers, information on the project's history. She's trying to figure out. . . CHAY: Whether the claims make sense from a scientific standpoint. SIMON: OK, essentially if the claims are legit or not. CHAY: Are the claims reasonable and defensible? ARONCZYK: Freya's team came up with a rating system for the proposals which involved check marks. Five check marks means the proposal is solid. Microsoft can be confident that this project should reduce its carbon footprint. SIMON: Presumably, one check isn't great. CHAY: Yeah, one check mark means we have a lot of questions about what is going on. SIMON: Now, ultimately, as they went through these proposals, they started to run into these really heady issues. ARONCZYK: Heady and really kind of similar to that old mental puzzle - you know the one - if a tree falls in the woods and no one's around, does it make a sound? SIMON: Freya says forest projects are based on similar hypotheticals. They raise all kinds of questions. Does that forest really need saving? Was it really in danger? And what happens to the offsets if the trees burn in a wildfire or if loggers just go and cut down another forest somewhere else? CHAY: If somebody is using offsets to justify their emissions, you want to be pretty confident that the purchase of that offset is creating new climate benefits now. SIMON: Freya's team found that when it came to the pitches that Microsoft received, more than two-thirds got just one check out of five. Pachama submitted five projects to Microsoft, and four of them got the lowest rating. Pachama says that despite these ratings, they're confident in the effectiveness of their projects. Microsoft didn't accept any of Pachama's proposals in this go-around. CHAY: I think we have to be really careful to care about quality. If we are buying and selling offsets that are not quality, we are not contributing to a climate solution even though it looks good on paper. So as much as we can encourage quality through transparency, the closer we get to making offsets a climate benefit rather than a net climate problem. ARONCZYK: This is something that concerns Freya's team, that the whole offset chain is flawed in large part because there is no one truly independent entity or governing body ensuring offset quality. The stamp of approval guys are basically the only regulators. SIMON: I brought these concerns to David, the CEO of Verra. Verra has given its stamp of approval to nearly 70% of all carbon offsets used by companies. ARONCZYK: The three concerns are, one, the hypotheticals - this is all pretty hard to verify - two, the regulatory worries and, three, are these offsets actually helping fix climate change? SIMON: I started with the first, the hypotheticals. There are so many what-ifs in offsets, but especially in these forest projects, you know, like the type that Dharsono runs and the type that Diego sells. There are just so many hypotheticals. And I guess the fundamental question is, can corporations sleep easy at night knowing that they're actually offsetting their emissions from forest projects that you verified? ANTONIOLI: I think the answer is yes, for sure. And you say there's so many hypotheticals. I don't think there are that many, quite frankly. I mean, we know how many trees are on the ground, right? We know how many get cut down. ARONCZYK: David says they address these hypotheticals in part by baking the eventualities into their models, into their calculations, and setting aside credits as insurance for events like wildfires. SIMON: Concern No. 2, regulation - that there's no real independent regulatory body overseeing this offset market, only private regulators, like Verra. David says an independent body could be useful, just so long as it doesn't overlap with his work. ARONCZYK: Which brings us to Concern No. 3. Is this even working? David says, of course. He has devoted his life to this, and he wouldn't be doing this work if he didn't think it was helping stop climate change. SIMON: There was one more thing I wanted to ask David about. It had to do with a study that had made waves in the carbon offset world published in one of the most prestigious science journals. The study looked at a bunch of these enormous forest projects in one of the world's deforestation hot spots, the Brazilian Amazon - projects Verra had given its stamp of approval to, including a few sold by Pachama, the broker. And the study found these projects were overestimating the deforestation that would have happened had they not been there by almost 60 times. Ten out of 12 Brazilian forestry projects that you gave your stamp of approval to didn't stop the deforestation they claimed. That's what that study found. So for the corporations that have purchased offsets from these projects, did they offset their emissions? ANTONIOLI: Yes, I think so. I mean, there are many great studies out there looking at the impacts of projects, and we welcome them. But we shouldn't be throwing the baby out with the bathwater just because there was one study that identified some projects that, according to one methodology, you know, didn't - you know, were different - the results were different than what we say. ARONCZYK: We also heard from some of the forest bosses who run these projects in Brazil, and they agree with David. SIMON: David says he welcomes critiques from studies like this, that they use them to build more nuance into Verra's rules for certification and their assessment process. But there are lots of companies that have already bought offsets from these huge projects that have already said, we can keep polluting because we are saving this forest in Brazil. Don't these investors need some sort of heads-up? ANTONIOLI: What do you mean? SIMON: I guess we're talking about these corporations buying offsets that were given the stamp of approval by you. Did those projects actually offset the emissions they said they were going to do? ANTONIOLI: Look; corporations have any number of tools to do their due diligence and figure out which credits they want to buy - which projects they want to buy credits from. And in the end, corporates have to decide what they do. But you can't be telling corporates all the sudden, oh, you know, your credits are bad, because that's going to chill investment. SIMON: Right. I'm not arguing that it is delivering investments. It's just the question is, is it delivering climate change emission reduction? ANTONIOLI: Yes, absolutely. It's - absolutely. There's no doubt in my mind that they are. SIMON: Right when I talked to David, they were publishing new standards. He says they're always updating and improving the rules so companies can have confidence in the offsets that they're buying. As for companies doing due diligence, Microsoft told us they've made a strategic decision that at the moment they will no longer buy offsets from this type of forest preservation project. They say it's too difficult to calculate whether the emissions are actually avoided. ARONCZYK: Now, it's important to remember where this all started - these pledges that companies are making. When companies say they're going net-zero or carbon negative, what they're signaling is that they are doing all they can to stop climate change, that they can keep polluting as long as they're offsetting it somewhere else. SIMON: Which is fine if the math works. And right now, that's a big if. Companies are putting hundreds of millions of dollars into these offset markets. So if the math doesn't work, these offset programs are just adding more planet-heating gases into the atmosphere, effectively doing more harm than good.

(SOUNDBITE OF COIN SPINNING) JULIA SIMON, HOST:   Early last year, the CEO of Microsoft got onstage at Microsoft headquarters. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Please welcome Satya Nadella. AMANDA ARONCZYK, HOST:   He walks on and stands facing the crowd. Behind him, there's this wall covered with these healthy-looking green leaves. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) SATYA NADELLA: Thank you so very much. It's fantastic to be here today. SIMON: It kind of looks like a TED Talk crossed with a product announcement. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) NADELLA: As corporations, our purpose and actions must be aligned to helping solve the world's problems, not create new ones. ARONCZYK: And then he gets to Microsoft's new pledge - to fight climate change. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) NADELLA: Today, we're making the commitment that by 2030, Microsoft will be carbon negative. ARONCZYK: Carbon negative - what does that even mean? Microsoft has offices around the world that use lots of electricity. They have fleets of cars and trucks, data centers that use diesel. All of those things mean carbon emissions. SIMON: But somehow, the CEO of Microsoft is saying his company's going to eliminate all those carbon emissions - even better, reverse them. ARONCZYK: Their plan? The answer, in part, has to do with what's displayed on the screen above him - images of giant pristine forests. SIMON: Forests, trees - these are not just nice nature images. Trees are going to solve some serious climate accounting problems for Microsoft. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) NADELLA: This is the decade to take bold steps forward to address our most pressing challenges. Thank you. (APPLAUSE) ARONCZYK: One-fifth of the world's largest companies have made pledges like this one to reduce their carbon footprint to zero or beyond. They've done the math and decided that they can do this in part by paying someone across the world to save trees - which, really, is that really how we're going to do this? (SOUNDBITE OF MAXIME PINTO'S \"CHINESE GANG\") SIMON: Hello, and welcome to PLANET MONEY. I'm Julia Simon. ARONCZYK: And I'm Amanda Aronczyk. Behind every carbon neutral or carbon negative pledge, there's some math that companies can continue polluting as long as they're offsetting it somewhere else. SIMON: Today on the show, does the tree math add up? And if it doesn't, what's that mean for just the biggest problem humanity's ever faced? (SOUNDBITE OF MAXIME PINTO'S \"CHINESE GANG\") SIMON: The logic of how a major carbon-emitting company can fight climate change by saving trees halfway around the world is kind of a journey. So today, we're going to take you through the steps, introduce you to the key players - the forest boss, the stamp of approval guy and the broker. ARONCZYK: First up, the forest boss. DHARSONO HARTONO: My name is Dharsono Hartono. SIMON: Dharsono controls one of the biggest forests in Indonesia. HARTONO: Just to give an idea of how big the area is, it's actually twice the size of New York. SIMON: So New York, the island, or Manhattan or? HARTONO: New York - New York - New York including the five boroughs. SIMON: Oh, all the - whoa, all the boroughs. Dharsono's journey to becoming a forest boss starts in 2007. He was in his early 30s, and he was at this conference in Bali. He goes to a lot of conferences. He has a lot of those cool silk batik shirts. ARONCZYK: And he had just moved back to Indonesia after working on Wall Street. And he's looking for his next big business thing, which is why he's at this conference. It's a palm oil conference. SIMON: Palm oil is one of Indonesia's largest exports. It's in everything. It's in your Nutella, in your Cheez-Its. It's in your soap. People cook with it. It's also pretty bad for the environment, leads to a lot of deforestation. So you were thinking that you would do what exactly in palm oil? HARTONO: I would basically do - to own a plantation at that time, right? SIMON: OK. While he's in Bali, he runs into an old college bud. ARONCZYK: And his buddy's like, dude, palm oil is so 2000-and-late. You got to look at the future. You got to get into the triple P. HARTONO: He was, like, saying, Dharsono, you have to do this triple P. SIMON: What did he mean (laughter)? HARTONO: I was like, what do you mean like triple P? There's this new business where technically you can save the planet, you can save the people and you can make profit. So it's a triple P. ARONCZYK: Dharsono's buddy's like, the profit is in the trees. You and I, we should start a business together. We're going to protect our forests - our Indonesian forests. SIMON: And Dharsono's like, I get that. Let the forest grow. The land becomes more valuable. A few years later, we can flip the forest, sell it for a profit. HARTONO: I was thinking of maybe this is just like real estate, right? You own something. You haul it for a long time, and you're going to make money. That's just the naive thinking of Dharsono in 2007. SIMON: (Laughter) Yeah. ARONCZYK: Dharsono's buddy is like, no, no, no, no. This is not about real estate. This is about climate change. Hear me out. In order to slow climate change, we - you know, everybody, whatever, the world - need to reduce our carbon emissions to nearly zero, and that includes big companies. But you know what's really hard when you're a big company? Reducing your emissions to zero. SIMON: This right here is the key reason why there's a business opportunity in Indonesia's massive forests. See, trees - they're kind of incredible. They suck carbon out of the air and store it, which is why companies will pay Indonesians to keep forests standing rather than let them get clear-cut. ARONCZYK: These payments are called offsets, as in, sure, we companies are emitting carbon into the atmosphere at home, but that's cool because those emissions are offset by that forest we're protecting in Indonesia. HARTONO: This area would have been deforested. Without our intervention, the area will be converted into pulp and paper. ARONCZYK: Pulp and paper - they would just cut down all the trees, deforesting the area. So Dharsono's buddy says, instead, let's preserve the forest. SIMON: Dharsono's like, yeah. He's convinced there's a business opportunity here, and he can help save the people and the planet through forests. He's not going to go into palm oil. ARONCZYK: Dharsono and his buddy start doing research. They have to figure out where the most desirable carbon-rich forests are. There are a few that they look at. None are perfect. But then. . . HARTONO: Then I remember, oh, yeah, there's this area that I know of, which is a peatland area in Sintang, Kalimantan. Should we go there? So it's like, OK, let's do it, right? SIMON: Dharsono and his buddy get to the area, and it's beautiful, a swampy forest home to orangutans and clouded leopards, absolutely full of carbon - totally worth preserving. ARONCZYK: This was the spot. Eventually, this project went on to become what might be the largest of its kind in the world, but that took a number of years. They had to get the rights to the land, which was really complicated. In 2013, they finally got them. And then they formally start working with local communities to protect the forest. SIMON: This all costs a lot. And Dharsono - he wants to make a profit. He needs customers. But before companies will give him money to save the trees, he's got to prove that he's really saving them. To do that, he needs to go to the stamp of approval guy. Do you know Dharsono Hartono? DAVID ANTONIOLI: Yes, I do. SIMON: He needs to go to David Antonioli. ANTONIOLI: I'm the chief executive officer of Verra. ARONCZYK: David's nonprofit, Verra, validates forest projects like Dharsono's to make sure that they're taking as much carbon out of the atmosphere as they say they are. ANTONIOLI: We're a standard setter. So we spend all of our time developing the rules and the procedures, the standard, that project developers like Dharsono and others need to follow.

And in the end, corporates have to decide what they do. But you can't be telling corporates all the sudden, oh, you know, your credits are bad, because that's going to chill investment. SIMON: Right. I'm not arguing that it is delivering investments. It's just the question is, is it delivering climate change emission reduction? ANTONIOLI: Yes, absolutely. It's - absolutely. There's no doubt in my mind that they are. SIMON: Right when I talked to David, they were publishing new standards. He says they're always updating and improving the rules so companies can have confidence in the offsets that they're buying. As for companies doing due diligence, Microsoft told us they've made a strategic decision that at the moment they will no longer buy offsets from this type of forest preservation project. They say it's too difficult to calculate whether the emissions are actually avoided. ARONCZYK: Now, it's important to remember where this all started - these pledges that companies are making. When companies say they're going net-zero or carbon negative, what they're signaling is that they are doing all they can to stop climate change, that they can keep polluting as long as they're offsetting it somewhere else. SIMON: Which is fine if the math works. And right now, that's a big if. Companies are putting hundreds of millions of dollars into these offset markets. So if the math doesn't work, these offset programs are just adding more planet-heating gases into the atmosphere, effectively doing more harm than good.

If you've spent time around them, you likely know they love to curl up in small, cozy boxes. What you may not know - if you draw a square shape on the floor, cats will often sit in that, too. As NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce reports, this made scientists curious about how cats would react to a certain optical illusion. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE, BYLINE: No one knows why cats love to get in boxes. Gabriella Smith is an animal behavior researcher with the Alex Foundation. She says one theory is that cats are comforted by pressure on their sides because it reminds them of when they were kittens, sleeping with littermates. GABRIELLA SMITH: Another theory is that since they're ambush predators, they have attraction to hiding. GREENFIELDBOYCE: But neither of those reasons explains why cats will also go sit inside a two-dimensional square. Smith recently wondered if cats would sit inside the optical illusion of a square. There's a famous one, the Kanizsa illusion. SMITH: The Kanizsa Illusion can be described as four Pac-Men with the right angle facing inwards. So the four Pac-Man mouths face inwards, and they create an illusory square. GREENFIELDBOYCE: She designed an experiment that people could do at home with their cats by downloading a packet of information that included different shapes. SMITH: They printed them out, cut them out, taped them on the floor, and then took out their phone and recorded their cat for five minutes interacting with the stimuli. GREENFIELDBOYCE: The cats got to ponder three different choices - the outline of a square, four Pac-Men set up to create the Kanizsa illusion and four Pac-Men that faced the wrong way. The cats liked the square, and they liked the illusion of the square, too. SMITH: Cats stood or sat within the contours of the Kanizsa illusion just as much as the square. GREENFIELDBOYCE: She and her colleagues describe their work in the journal Applied Animal Behaviour Science. And it got the attention of Kristyn Vitale. She's a cat behavior researcher with Unity College. KRISTYN VITALE: I did think what was really interesting about it was the methods that they used to collect the data, which was that citizen science approach. GREENFIELDBOYCE: She thinks cat owners collecting data at home has a lot of promise for future research on cat behavior and cognition. Cats have historically been harder to study than dogs. Cats generally don't like trips to strange places like a lab, and cooperation is not really their thing. Nell Greenfieldboyce, NPR News. MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:   Now to cats.

This plutonium was forged in a cosmic cataclysm and rained down on Earth. NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce reports on why researchers went looking for it in the first place. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE, BYLINE: Astronomer Carl Sagan used to say, we are made of star stuff. He meant it literally. The burning cores of stars forged elements like carbon, nitrogen and oxygen. But what about the heaviest elements on the periodic table - ones like gold, platinum, uranium, plutonium? ANTON WALLNER: These are the elements where we are still in a mystery, and we do not know exactly where they are produced and how much is produced in different sites. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Anton Wallner is a physicist with the Australian National University. He led an international team that's been trying to get clues about how these elements are made by looking for specimens that arrived on Earth relatively recently. He says a massive star explosion or collision will spew out a slew of elements. Those can find their way to our planet and get incorporated into certain rocks. WALLNER: So the idea is that we have samples which collected these extraterrestrial particles over the last thousands or millions of years. GREENFIELDBOYCE: The sample in this study was a rock from nearly a mile beneath the Pacific Ocean. It was hauled up by an oil exploration company.

After all, we're talking about hundreds of atoms here. But, you know, we should be grateful for that because they're freshly made from exploding stars. GREENFIELDBOYCE: What kind of star explosion isn't clear. What the researchers saw in the rock had to have been produced by something more than just the typical death throes of massive stars, which are known as supernova explosions. It looks like more rare events must be involved, too, like maybe collisions between neutron stars. Those are super-dense stars as small as a city, yet with more mass than our sun.

Sam Brasch of Colorado Public Radio reports. (SOUNDBITE OF VEHICLE BEEPING)SAM BRASCH, BYLINE: At a construction site in north Denver, Katie Hegarty oversees a crew inside a recently dug pit. At the bottom is a sewer pipe. It's one of the main arteries transporting the city's wastewater. KATIE HEGARTY: We still call it wastewater, but it's not wasted. We're using it to recover heat that can both heat and cool this campus. BRASCH: That campus will soon host the National Western Stock Show and Rodeo. It's an old West event getting new West digs. A massive remodel is adding an arena, offices and classrooms. And all that new space will be kept comfy with sewer heat. HEGARTY: I've built all sorts of different projects. Nothing like this before. BRASCH: It's no mystery where the excess heat comes from. Any time you take a shower or wash the dishes, you're literally sending energy down the drain. The Department of Energy estimates the total amount could power about 30 million U. S. homes for a whole year. By recovering some of it, buildings can avoid climate warming emissions. And there's another benefit, too. WILLIAM CAVANAUGH: After the wastewater is collected and treated, we return it to the river and recharge the river at this location. BRASCH: William Cavanaugh is with the Metro Wastewater Reclamation District. We're outside its massive treatment plants, where waterfalls of clean sewage cascade into Denver's South Platte River. Cavanaugh says the water is warmer than the river itself and that thermal pollution can harm aquatic life. But the sewer heat system will actually cool the wastewater. CAVANAUGH: That's correct. We're removing thermal energy. And so that'll help us move towards our goals of reducing the temperature in our effluent. BRASCH: So to recap, the project will cut carbon emissions and improve river health. It's a win-win. So what's making this possible now? Shanti Pless is with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. And he says one reason is improvements to heat pumps, which are basically reversible air conditioners. SHANTI PLESS: With the advent of large-scale heat pumps, we can now cost effectively, you know, use, you know, say, 70-degree wastewater to heat our buildings and our hot water systems. BRASCH: Pless says the technology is opening up a whole new world of renewable heat mining. But those systems tend to work best for whole neighborhoods or districts, not individual homes or buildings. He says the Denver project could prove the upfront investment is worth it. PLESS: The National Western project has been a great local example for us to take that idea to the to the rest of the country. BRASCH: But the people behind the project also worry it could trigger a kind of sewer heat gold rush. Brad Buchanan is the CEO of the National Western Center. And he says his plans for the campus came together. BRAD BUCHANAN: We have to answer the question, how do we protect these sewer thermal energy rights? BRASCH: The result was an agreement guaranteeing the campus exclusive access to energy inside nearby sewer pipes. Buchanan says that has him thinking about the whole future of real estate. BUCHANAN: If folks sort of start to look at not just where light rail lines are located or good schools are located, but what's the proximity to a large sanitary sewer line running through Denver somewhere?

They outnumber scientists and are more likely to be in the right place at the right time. NPR science correspondent Richard Harris has this story of a photographer who helped rediscover a mushroom that hadn't been seen in the United States for more than a century. RICHARD HARRIS, BYLINE: The man is Taylor Lockwood. We meet in the hills of West Virginia, where he has been prowling the countryside in a van he has converted into a camper, a photo studio and a workshop. TAYLOR LOCKWOOD: You can see I've been over the hill with all the dust on my car. But I have my gear, workshop. . . HARRIS: And a pullout kitchen, stove and pantry included. More about his workshop and his inventions in a minute. LOCKWOOD: I'm in my Edison mode. HARRIS: First, the back story. Growing up, Lockwood spent the 1970s playing electric violin and other instruments in bands out West. He worked as a contractor. And in 1984, while living on the Mendocino Coast in California, he fell in love with mushrooms. LOCKWOOD: Outside my cabin were these beautiful mushrooms. And it was as if these mushrooms looked at me and said, Taylor, go out and tell the world how beautiful we are. And I said, OK, I'll do it. HARRIS: Lockwood bought camera gear and became passionate about photographing mushrooms. One of his images is even on a U. S. postage stamp. He says sometimes he'd dig a hole next to a mushroom for his camera to get just the right angle. LOCKWOOD: I wanted to see them as a frog would. HARRIS: His passion for mushroom photography has taken him around the world. And what he has found and photographed doesn't just have artistic interest. He, like many other amateur mushroom hunters, works symbiotically with the professionals, the mycologists who study fungi. LOCKWOOD: I might have hundreds or thousands of photos of things that are unnamed or unknown or, you know, might be known some other continent. HARRIS: He made one of those memorable discoveries here in the Monongahela National Forest. A few years back, he came across something he'd never seen before - a mushroom that looked like tiny fingers wearing off-white gloves. LOCKWOOD: Like most mushrooms, I saw it as natural beauty, and that's why I took a picture of it. HARRIS: He posted that photo on a website called mushroomobserver. org, where professional and amateur mushroom experts meet to crowdsource information. This site is the brainchild of Nathan Wilson, another amateur who started the project in 2006 as a way to display his own mushroom pictures. NATHAN WILSON: I told my friends about, it and they told their friends about it, and it has been successful beyond my wildest dreams. And it's got millions of images on it from over 100 countries, and it's great. HARRIS: And it's not just pretty pictures; it's a valuable scientific resource. WILSON: There are many more amateurs than there are professionals, and the professionals often end up relying on amateurs - or, quote, \"amateurs. \"HARRIS: Expert amateurs like Taylor Lockwood, who provide not just images but data. His West Virginia photo caught the eye of Amy Rossman, who, for many years, ran the federal government's National Fungus Collection. She recognized the distinct form of this mushroom but found only three records of it growing on plants in the United States. AMY ROSSMAN: Two on rhododendron. That was from 1888 by Roland Thaxter in Tennessee. And 1915 was one from Maine. Those are the three in there. HARRIS: A sample of this rare mushroom made its way to a graduate student in Scotland, who ran a DNA test on it and verified its identity, hypocreopsis rhododendri. Rossman says it's not just rare, it appears to have a bizarre lifestyle. It doesn't grow directly on wood. It's a parasite that lives only on another species of fungus that forms a crust on branches. ROSSMAN: But the crust fungus itself is not very big, so you'd wonder, how could you get a parasite that's so much bigger than the thing it parasitizes? HARRIS: One hypothesis is that it essentially uses the crust fungus as a straw and sucks up nutrients through it. It's hard to study since most of the time, fungi like the finger mushroom live hidden as tiny threads that run through their hosts. ROSSMAN: They're not like plants. They don't come up at the same time every year, and so sometimes it can be decades between when a fungus fruits. HARRIS: That is when it produces a mushroom cap.

As you said, this is - we're not exactly mushroom season, but my feet are sinking into the ground here, so it tells me at least it's wet. LOCKWOOD: Oh, yeah, it's wet. It's wet. Oh, here's something. HARRIS: He reaches down to get a close look at a downed branch that has turned a color you don't usually see in wood. LOCKWOOD: This blue-green is chlorociboria. It's not fruiting now, but it shows the blue-green color of the fungi in here. And when it has little fruit bodies coming out, they're beautiful, blue-green little ears. HARRIS: Lockwood has been drawn back to this spot for his latest effort. And this gets back to the story of his portable workshop. A few years ago, he decided still photographs weren't enough. He wanted to make time-lapse videos of mushrooms. LOCKWOOD: When I do time-lapse, you find that there's lots and lots of life going around the mushroom - insect life and worms and all kinds of things like that. HARRIS: His art involves not only photographing mushrooms over time, but also putting his camera in motion to create otherworldly videos. At a campsite, he sets up a curved track made out of PVC plumbing pipe and puts a motorized wooden camera platform on top. LOCKWOOD: This is the dolly, and it's all handmade stuff - my little inventions. HARRIS: He plugs the motor into some circuitry he's built so the platform moves at something slower than a snail's pace while the camera is set to take a photo every six seconds. LOCKWOOD: So I'm just going to set this up and leave it. I can just leave this. And I'm going to put a marker here, and we'll just let it go. HARRIS: This is a test run to try out new gear he's built. It may be weeks or even months before he finds the perfect mushroom to video. But at 74 years old, he's a patient man and happy to be out in the woods making discoveries and making beautiful images. LOCKWOOD: I love the science, but, you know, I'm an artist at heart. And I love doing this. I love finding beautiful mushrooms. HARRIS: And sometimes beauty and science intersect. Richard Harris, NPR News. LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST:   Scientists who study mushrooms often rely on help from talented amateurs. They outnumber scientists and are more likely to be in the right place at the right time. NPR science correspondent Richard Harris has this story of a photographer who helped rediscover a mushroom that hadn't been seen in the United States for more than a century. RICHARD HARRIS, BYLINE: The man is Taylor Lockwood. We meet in the hills of West Virginia, where he has been prowling the countryside in a van he has converted into a camper, a photo studio and a workshop. TAYLOR LOCKWOOD: You can see I've been over the hill with all the dust on my car. But I have my gear, workshop. . . HARRIS: And a pullout kitchen, stove and pantry included. More about his workshop and his inventions in a minute. LOCKWOOD: I'm in my Edison mode. HARRIS: First, the back story. Growing up, Lockwood spent the 1970s playing electric violin and other instruments in bands out West. He worked as a contractor. And in 1984, while living on the Mendocino Coast in California, he fell in love with mushrooms. LOCKWOOD: Outside my cabin were these beautiful mushrooms. And it was as if these mushrooms looked at me and said, Taylor, go out and tell the world how beautiful we are. And I said, OK, I'll do it. HARRIS: Lockwood bought camera gear and became passionate about photographing mushrooms. One of his images is even on a U. S. postage stamp. He says sometimes he'd dig a hole next to a mushroom for his camera to get just the right angle. LOCKWOOD: I wanted to see them as a frog would. HARRIS: His passion for mushroom photography has taken him around the world. And what he has found and photographed doesn't just have artistic interest. He, like many other amateur mushroom hunters, works symbiotically with the professionals, the mycologists who study fungi. LOCKWOOD: I might have hundreds or thousands of photos of things that are unnamed or unknown or, you know, might be known some other continent. HARRIS: He made one of those memorable discoveries here in the Monongahela National Forest. A few years back, he came across something he'd never seen before - a mushroom that looked like tiny fingers wearing off-white gloves. LOCKWOOD: Like most mushrooms, I saw it as natural beauty, and that's why I took a picture of it. HARRIS: He posted that photo on a website called mushroomobserver. org, where professional and amateur mushroom experts meet to crowdsource information.

S. is in extreme drought. A good spring snowmelt could bring some relief by helping to fill streams and reservoirs. But a warming climate and the effects of the drought are putting water for millions of people at-risk. Michael Elizabeth Sakas of Colorado Public Radio reports. MICHAEL ELIZABETH SAKAS, BYLINE: There's still snow in some of Colorado's mountains. Brian Domonkos, supervisor of the Colorado Snow Survey, glides through trees on skis. BRIAN DOMONKOS: We are near the headwaters of the South Platte River to figure out how much snowpack we have that's left to run off into our streams, rivers and reservoirs. SAKAS: To do this, Domonkos jabs a tall metal pipe into the snow to collect a core sample. The snowpack here is over 100% of what's normal for this time of year. But that's not the case for most of Colorado or the West. In the southwest corner of Colorado, snowpack is at less than 30%. Domonkos says there's a concerning trend that goes back to last year's near-record heat. DOMONKOS: That might be the real wow factor for me, where the soil moisture deficits and low stream flows that we're seeing in the fall prior are having such a massive impact on the current year's streams. SAKAS: Climate change is disrupting the system in a number of ways. Unusually dry soils absorb a lot of the water that melts from the snowpack, which means that water isn't making it to rivers. DOMONKOS: Even if we had a good snowpack year that was above normal, it may not really boost us out of that shorter-term drought. And that's where I think some of our concerns for us, as professionals. The deeper we get, we wonder if we're able to get out of it. SAKAS: Overall, the trend shows less snowpack accumulation due to warmer temperatures. What does collect melts sooner and faster, which means less snow on the ground and a greater chance for wildfires. Becky Bolinger is the assistant Colorado state climatologist. She says unusually dry soil means. . . BECKY BOLINGER: We are starting with a deficit that needs to be made up. You realize in order to have a normal runoff season and get what you need into the reservoirs, you need above average snowpack. SAKAS: Two big reservoirs of concern are Lake Powell and Lake Mead in Arizona and Nevada. The forecasted inflows for Lake Powell from the Colorado River is around a third of average. BOLINGER: This wouldn't be a concern if Lake Powell and Lake Mead had more water in them. But they are already at critically low levels. SAKAS: It's likely the federal government will declare a formal water shortage in the coming months in the Colorado River basin, which means mandatory water cutbacks in some states. For parts of Colorado, snowpack is the reservoir. Sonja Chavez is the manager of the Upper Gunnison River Water Conservancy District. The area has around half of its normal snowpack. And life is hard for ranchers. Chavez says three years of back-to-back drought means there's less hay. SONJA CHAVEZ: This year, we're starting to see our producers reduce their number of their cattle herd. And that has trickling economic effects throughout our basin. SAKAS: Chavez says water managers are planning for worst-case scenarios. She says more people have moved to the Gunnison area because of a boom in remote work with the COVID-19 pandemic. Some of the well water rights on those homes are newer. CHAVEZ: For some of those junior water right holders, they just may not get their water at all, which is a concern. SAKAS: The last time the drought was this bad was in 2002. Chavez says with the poor snowpack numbers, water managers think this year could be worse.

(SOUNDBITE OF BIRDS CHIRPING)SETH BODINE, BYLINE: Birds chirp as Scott Loss walks around buildings at Oklahoma State University. He has a notepad in one hand and a bird identification book in the other. SCOTT LOSS: This is one of the 16 buildings that we monitored. BODINE: Loss is on a team of researchers studying bird collisions into buildings like this one at the Noble Research Center. He points out features of the building that make it one of the biggest bird killers that they've studied. LOSS: Looking up here, you can obviously see really extensive large panes of glass, entire facades of the building covered with glass. BODINE: Loss says birds don't see glass very well, and buildings like this are problematic. He estimates up to 1 billion birds die every year in the United States after building collisions. That has researchers worried. Loss says bird populations have declined in the past 30 years, and that's not good for the environment. LOSS: Birds have a tremendous value to ecosystems and their functions. They're pollinators. They're seed dispersers. They control certain undesirable insects and other pests. BODINE: Researchers think using radar technology to track birds flying at night could be part of the solution to help save them. When large flocks are seen migrating across the country, cities can be given a heads-up to dim lights. As Loss looks at a computer screen, he explains how the colors on the map are similar to a weather forecast. LOSS: Just like with precipitation, the color scale represents intensity of the radar return. With heavy precipitation, you get the darker greens, the yellows, the reds. With heavy bird migration, you get the same. BODINE: Conservation efforts are already playing out in Texas with a pilot project called Lights Out Texas. The Cornell Lab of Ornithology is partnering with politicians and local conservation groups to encourage residents and businesses to dim non-essential lights in major cities like Dallas, Houston and Austin.

So birds will kind of veer off course and fly towards these cities, which, you know, leads them to even more hazards. BODINE: Researchers think dimming lights might make a difference. Jared Elmore is a lead author of a study that found the number of collisions could be predicted by how many birds migrate at night. JARED ELMORE: And we saw a lot of birds coming through the airspace, and they were migrating at lower height. We would expect, you know, a higher number of collisions to occur. BODINE: Bird experts hope the radar technology could be used to help inform public policy. In Texas, the conservation project wraps up next month.

More than 30 states have introduced bills that would ban them from participating. The issue is emotionally charged, and it's hard to find a middle ground. But NPR's Tom Goldman reports on a pioneering researcher trying to get there. TOM GOLDMAN, BYLINE: With the simple act of signing his name, Mississippi Governor Tate Reeves turned the debate over transgender female athletes into reality. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TATE REEVES: Senate Bill 2536, the Mississippi Fairness Act, is now law. GOLDMAN: The law, banning transgender athletes from high school and university female teams, is scheduled to take effect this year. The legislation Reeves signed in March and other similar state bills cite science to make the case that after puberty, transgender female athletes have an absolute advantage over cisgender female athletes, even after therapy to reduce the powerful hormone testosterone. And therefore, the trans athletes should be banned from female sports. But none of the lawmakers behind these bills reached out to Joanna Harper. JOANNA HARPER: My official title is Ph. D. researcher at Loughborough University. GOLDMAN: Unofficially, Harper is a scientist in the middle of a debate that's being waged at the angry extremes between those who want to ban and those who want blanket inclusion - any person who identifies as female can play women's sports. The banning side doesn't want to hear this. HARPER: In most sports, after hormone therapy, it is perfectly reasonable to allow trans women to compete against cisgender women. GOLDMAN: That's because the therapy, Harper says, can make the playing field more level, even though trans women still can retain advantages like strength and size after transitioning. She believes hormone therapy should be required at high levels of sport, and that restriction angers some on the other side. HARPER: There are people who consider me a traitor to trans people. GOLDMAN: What she is is a pioneer in transgender research, which Harper never intended to be. Seventeen years ago, she started taking pills to add estrogen and block testosterone as part of her transition from male to female. She also prepared to change athletically. At one time, she was ranked among the top male distance runners in her native Canada. HARPER: Within nine months of starting hormone therapy in 2004, I was running 12% slower. GOLDMAN: Which both bothered her as a competitor and intrigued her as a scientifically curious person - so she started collecting data. She got race teams from eight transgender women before and after hormone therapy. One of the effects of reducing testosterone is reducing hemoglobin, which carries oxygen-rich red blood cells throughout the body. It provides fuel for endurance athletes. And with less, the athletes slow down, which is what happened in Harper's study. Collectively, the women were more than 10% slower after therapy. HARPER: And that's an important number because that's the difference between serious male distance runners and serious female distance runners - 10- to 12% sort of range. GOLDMAN: In 2015, she published her data in the first paper on transgender athletes. She then wrote the book \"Sporting Gender\" and helps sports organizations like the International Olympic Committee craft policies in the middle - inclusive of transgender female athletes and restrictive by requiring them to undergo hormone therapy. Dr. Eric Vilain, a Washington, D. C. -based geneticist and expert on sex differences, said Harper's research has been groundbreaking. ERIC VILAIN: Looking at data on trans athletes, I don't see that there is any kind of fear to have that suddenly the world of sports is going to be topsy-turvy and very unfair for all women out there. GOLDMAN: It's harder to assess the impact with younger trans athletes. High schoolers develop at different rates, making it tough to create one-size-fits-all rules. Plus, the numbers are so small. Harper says transgender people make up less than 2% of the population, and trans kids are one-sixth as likely as cisgender kids to go out for school sports. Still, the debate rages, and Harper's goal of pulling people toward the middle continues. Since 2019, she's been at Loughborough University, a prominent sports science school in England. Harper says the science of transgender athletes still is in its infancy. She's broadening her research to different sports, fueled by a personal mantra - more data will lead to better policies.

TOM GOLDMAN, BYLINE: With the simple act of signing his name, Mississippi Governor Tate Reeves turned the debate over transgender female athletes into reality. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TATE REEVES: Senate Bill 2536, the Mississippi Fairness Act, is now law. GOLDMAN: The law, banning transgender athletes from high school and university female teams, is scheduled to take effect this year. The legislation Reeves signed in March and other similar state bills cite science to make the case that after puberty, transgender female athletes have an absolute advantage over cisgender female athletes, even after therapy to reduce the powerful hormone testosterone. And therefore, the trans athletes should be banned from female sports. But none of the lawmakers behind these bills reached out to Joanna Harper. JOANNA HARPER: My official title is Ph. D. researcher at Loughborough University. GOLDMAN: Unofficially, Harper is a scientist in the middle of a debate that's being waged at the angry extremes between those who want to ban and those who want blanket inclusion - any person who identifies as female can play women's sports. The banning side doesn't want to hear this. HARPER: In most sports, after hormone therapy, it is perfectly reasonable to allow trans women to compete against cisgender women. GOLDMAN: That's because the therapy, Harper says, can make the playing field more level, even though trans women still can retain advantages like strength and size after transitioning. She believes hormone therapy should be required at high levels of sport, and that restriction angers some on the other side. HARPER: There are people who consider me a traitor to trans people. GOLDMAN: What she is is a pioneer in transgender research, which Harper never intended to be. Seventeen years ago, she started taking pills to add estrogen and block testosterone as part of her transition from male to female. She also prepared to change athletically. At one time, she was ranked among the top male distance runners in her native Canada. HARPER: Within nine months of starting hormone therapy in 2004, I was running 12% slower. GOLDMAN: Which both bothered her as a competitor and intrigued her as a scientifically curious person - so she started collecting data. She got race teams from eight transgender women before and after hormone therapy. One of the effects of reducing testosterone is reducing hemoglobin, which carries oxygen-rich red blood cells throughout the body. It provides fuel for endurance athletes. And with less, the athletes slow down, which is what happened in Harper's study. Collectively, the women were more than 10% slower after therapy. HARPER: And that's an important number because that's the difference between serious male distance runners and serious female distance runners - 10- to 12% sort of range. GOLDMAN: In 2015, she published her data in the first paper on transgender athletes. She then wrote the book \"Sporting Gender\" and helps sports organizations like the International Olympic Committee craft policies in the middle - inclusive of transgender female athletes and restrictive by requiring them to undergo hormone therapy. Dr. Eric Vilain, a Washington, D. C. -based geneticist and expert on sex differences, said Harper's research has been groundbreaking. ERIC VILAIN: Looking at data on trans athletes, I don't see that there is any kind of fear to have that suddenly the world of sports is going to be topsy-turvy and very unfair for all women out there. GOLDMAN: It's harder to assess the impact with younger trans athletes. High schoolers develop at different rates, making it tough to create one-size-fits-all rules. Plus, the numbers are so small. Harper says transgender people make up less than 2% of the population, and trans kids are one-sixth as likely as cisgender kids to go out for school sports. Still, the debate rages, and Harper's goal of pulling people toward the middle continues. Since 2019, she's been at Loughborough University, a prominent sports science school in England. Harper says the science of transgender athletes still is in its infancy. She's broadening her research to different sports, fueled by a personal mantra - more data will lead to better policies.

S. , the everyday sounds of birds and cars and barking dogs have been joined by something else. (SOUNDBITE OF CICADAS BUZZING, BIRDS SINGING)CHANG: A buzzing that means Brood X is back. After 17 years underground, millions and millions of cicadas are emerging. And as they fly clumsily around going about their business, scientists are busy too. As NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce reports, for people who study insects, this is a major event. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE, BYLINE: Brood X isn't the only group of cicadas that spends nearly two decades underground, but it is the biggest and most famous. That's why entomologist Marianne Alleyne drove east. She normally works at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champagne. MARIANNE ALLEYNE: I didn't see it 17 years ago, and I wanted to experience it. My brother-in-law actually said it perfectly. This is your entomology Woodstock, isn't it? GREENFIELDBOYCE: She studies tiny structures in cicada wings that make water droplets just roll off their surface, so she collected Brood X cicadas to bring back to her lab. And other scientists were out there collecting them too. MARY SALCEDO: Be very careful. They're everywhere right over here. GREENFIELDBOYCE: It's dusk in Alexandria, Va. , outside a middle school. And researchers from Virginia Tech are scanning the grass under old oak trees. They grab brown shrimp-like cicada nymphs that have just surfaced. JOSH PULLIAM: Fifty-six, 57, 58, 59. SALCEDO: Sixty, 61. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Mary Salcedo and Josh Pulliam count out a hundred into a brown paper bag. The insects scrabble around inside. (SOUNDBITE OF CICADAS RUSTLING)GREENFIELDBOYCE: They're desperate to climb. The researchers take them back to an Airbnb rental and let them creep up a sheet of cloth taped to the wall. Partway up, the nymphs freeze and begin to transform into adults. The back of each shell splits apart. A soft new body swells out. Mary Salcedo uses cameras to closely watch how the bright yellow tissue that becomes their wings gradually unfolds and expands. SALCEDO: It's very thin tissue that looks like a beautiful origami structure when it first comes out, so just the unfurling pattern is really interesting. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Meanwhile, Josh Pulliam wants to understand the biomechanics of their climbing. He's been testing nymphs on little homemade climbing walls covered with rough or smooth sandpaper. He says their two forelimbs do this up-and-down motion. PULLIAM: That's excellent for digging and gets them where they need to go on trees. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Other researchers are studying the ecological impact of this mass cicada emergence. Since cicadas' only defense is overwhelming predators with sheer numbers, they're a bonanza of free food. To see if birds chow down and ignore their usual prey like caterpillars, one team of researchers is doing an experiment in a Maryland forest. Martha Weiss is a biologist with Georgetown University. MARTHA WEISS: I have a box of beautiful, green fake caterpillars which are ready to be deployed on our trees with our trusty superglue. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Since the fakes are made of soft clay, a bird or insect that tries to eat one will leave telltale marks. JOHN LILL: See that? WEISS: Oh, yeah, that's nice. LILL: Really nice - so you see the parallel lines were from a beak. GREENFIELDBOYCE: John Lill is a biologist at George Washington University. He and his colleagues regularly come out to collect previously deployed fake caterpillars and put out new ones. This lets them track how often caterpillars are being attacked. They're also measuring how much leaves get chewed by caterpillars and the number of caterpillar parasites. LILL: So we're trying to catch what it looked like the year before the cicadas, what it looks like in the year of the cicadas before they come out, while they're out and then after they're gone for the - within a season. And then we'll do again - the same thing again next year and the year after that. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Lill says there hasn't been much research looking at these kinds of subtle ripple effects from Brood X. Zoe Getman-Pickering works in his lab. ZOE GETMAN-PICKERING: There's so many unanswered questions still. We're hoping that many of the children who are living through this emergence will be just as curious as we are and consider entomology as a career path. GREENFIELDBOYCE: After all, in 17 years, these cicadas will return, and so will scientists. Nell Greenfieldboyce, NPR News.

Some businesses and local governments are spending big money to change that. Corporations like Walmart, Dollar General and Kroger supermarkets are offering cash stipends for vaccinated employees, while states like Maryland, Colorado and Ohio have announced lotteries with huge cash prizes for people who've received shots. To talk about which of these incentives work best and why, we are joined by behavioral economist Katy Milkman a professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton Business School. Welcome. KATY MILKMAN: Thank you for having me. I'm excited to be here. SHAPIRO: You've been doing real-world research on this. You're helping states and health providers design vaccine incentives. So what have you learned so far about the things that work? MILKMAN: Well, there's a lot of research that's been done before with different kinds of decisions showing that lotteries are highly motivating if you're trying to convince someone to change a behavior. And people overweight the very low probabilities of winning a lottery, and as a result of that, they get very excited about the potential for this grand prize. It draws a lot of media attention, so there's free marketing. And those two things together appear to drive a lot of behavior change, and there's lots of research supporting that in the past. SHAPIRO: What else has your research shown about the kinds of incentives that are more effective? MILKMAN: Well, there's a couple of really interesting things about lottery incentives that can make them, it seems, more effective. One is that you don't need a huge jackpot. Actually, if you look at the way lotteries are typically run, there's normally some smaller prizes included that you have a better chance of winning. And one of the reasons for that is that it starts to feel more realistic. And that's research by Kevin Volpe and his group at the Center for Health Incentives and Behavioral Economics at Penn has shown that. There's also really interesting research on the power of what's called a regret lottery, and Kevin has also led some of this work. What a regret lottery does is imagine if everyone in a state is eligible. We draw a name. And then we tell you, hey, did you get vaccinated? If you did, you won a million dollars. If you didn't, sorry, you're not going to give that million, but you'll know you would have if only you'd made a different decision. So you can see now why it's called a regret lottery. SHAPIRO: Wow. MILKMAN: Exactly. People are going to really regret it, they recognize, if their name is drawn and they turn out to be ineligible because they didn't take the action. SHAPIRO: How persuasive are these incentives? I mean, can they make people who are opposed to getting the vaccine decide to get the shot anyway, or is it pretty much just people who are on the fence? MILKMAN: If someone is adamantly opposed to vaccination, they have a strong reason that they would never get a vaccine, paying them $100 is very unlikely to change their minds. But what we've seen in survey data is that there's a lot of people who are in what I'll call the movable middle. They're not adamantly opposed. The fraction of the population who's adamantly opposed to getting any kind of vaccine is actually fairly small. I've seen estimates ranging from 5- to 15%, but it's not huge. SHAPIRO: Oh, wow. MILKMAN: The focus is not on the adamant folks who are absolutely against it, it's rather on everyone else. SHAPIRO: I know your research has also dug into the kinds of messages that are most motivating for people. What have you found works best? MILKMAN: Yeah. We spent a lot of time in the last year testing different messages to encourage people to get a vaccine. And we actually tested these on flu vaccines last fall. The messages that focused on a vaccine being reserved for you or waiting for you outperformed others such as telling you the kinds of people who get a vaccine tend to be wealthier and better educated. Don't you want to join that group, or a simple message that shares a joke about getting the flu. You don't want to spread this one around. So we really value things that we own or that we feel belong to us. This is a phenomenon economists call the endowment effect. We overvalue our possessions relative to other things. We don't want to lose them. It also implies that this is the default, which means other people expect this. They're recommending it, in fact. And maybe most people are following this guidance. And since it's assumed that I'll want it, they've reserved it for me, and it must be the case that I probably should want it. All of that psychology combined is probably part of what's propping it up.

Here's NPR science correspondent Joe Palca. JOE PALCA, BYLINE: It's that darn needle that's the problem. But if you make the needle small enough, there is no pain. Mark Prausnitz from Georgia Tech University uses something called a microneedle to deliver vaccines. The microneedles are part of a patch he's used to deliver flu vaccines, but a similar patch could be used for a COVID-19 vax as well. Prausnitz says you do feel something when the microneedles are pressed against your skin. MARK PRAUSNITZ: If someone took some Velcro and pressed that firmly against your skin, there's kind of a roughness. Some people may describe it as a kind of tingling. So there is a sensation, but it's a sensation that people don't find objectionable or painful. PALCA: Prausnitz says the microneedle patch was an offshoot of the computer chip industry. Chipmakers got really good at making tiny structures out of silicon. PRAUSNITZ: They got smaller and smaller and eventually got down to the micron scale, which is what we need to make the microneedle patches. PALCA: Turns out your skin is a pretty good place to deliver a vaccine. It's full of immune cells. Prausnitz says the outermost part of the skin consists of a layer of cells thinner than a sheet of paper. PRAUSNITZ: So in principle, if you want to get into the body across this barrier layer of the skin, you don't need something that measures millimeters and then centimeters long, like conventional hypodermic needles; you need something actually very short - just tens of microns in length. PALCA: Those tiny needles are now frequently made out of water-soluble materials. So once they get into your skin, they dissolve, releasing whatever you've packed inside of them - in this case, a vaccineNADINE ROUPHAEL: The microneedle patch technology, the advantage of it, it's just - it's so easy to use. You can give the vaccine to yourself and it doesn't hurt. PALCA: Nadine Rouphael is a vaccine developer at Emory University. She's worked with Prausnitz developing the flu vaccine delivered by microneedles. ROUPHAEL: The other wonderful thing is the fact that the vaccine and the microneedle patch is very stable, no matter what the temperature outside is. PALCA: That would make getting vaccines to remote places way, way easier. Thanh Nguyen at the University of Connecticut is developing a way to make delivering vaccines easier still. He's made a patch that can deliver multiple vaccine doses spaced days or weeks apart, all with a single application. The trick is to embed the vaccine in needles that dissolve at different rates. THANH NGUYEN: The patient wouldn't need to remember the schedule of the vaccination. They wouldn't need to receive another patch for repeatedly receiving the vaccines. PALCA: So with all these promising applications, why are there no vaccines delivered by microneedle patches on the market? Darin Zehrung of the global health organization called PATH in Seattle says the answer is clear. DARIN ZEHRUNG: What's needed is the commitment by industry to that as a particular product. PALCA: Notice I just said no microneedle patch for vaccination - you can go on the internet now and buy microneedle patches from cosmetic companies that promise to smooth your skin and remove wrinkles. Zehrung says, for vaccines and other medical applications, there are still questions about just how well the patches will work. Initial studies are encouraging but not definitive. And then there's the question about whether they can be manufactured at scale for a reasonable cost. Zehrung has been banging the drum for microneedle patches for 15 years, largely because he thinks they would provide a better way to distribute vaccines globally. ZEHRUNG: I am more optimistic than I have been in the past. I think we're getting closer. PALCA: The world would be the beneficiary if he's right. Joe Palca, NPR News.

PRAUSNITZ: So in principle, if you want to get into the body across this barrier layer of the skin, you don't need something that measures millimeters and then centimeters long, like conventional hypodermic needles; you need something actually very short - just tens of microns in length. PALCA: Those tiny needles are now frequently made out of water-soluble materials. So once they get into your skin, they dissolve, releasing whatever you've packed inside of them - in this case, a vaccine NADINE ROUPHAEL: The microneedle patch technology, the advantage of it, it's just - it's so easy to use. You can give the vaccine to yourself and it doesn't hurt. PALCA: Nadine Rouphael is a vaccine developer at Emory University. She's worked with Prausnitz developing the flu vaccine delivered by microneedles. ROUPHAEL: The other wonderful thing is the fact that the vaccine and the microneedle patch is very stable, no matter what the temperature outside is. PALCA: That would make getting vaccines to remote places way, way easier. Thanh Nguyen at the University of Connecticut is developing a way to make delivering vaccines easier still. He's made a patch that can deliver multiple vaccine doses spaced days or weeks apart, all with a single application. The trick is to embed the vaccine in needles that dissolve at different rates. THANH NGUYEN: The patient wouldn't need to remember the schedule of the vaccination. They wouldn't need to receive another patch for repeatedly receiving the vaccines. PALCA: So with all these promising applications, why are there no vaccines delivered by microneedle patches on the market? Darin Zehrung of the global health organization called PATH in Seattle says the answer is clear. DARIN ZEHRUNG: What's needed is the commitment by industry to that as a particular product. PALCA: Notice I just said no microneedle patch for vaccination - you can go on the internet now and buy microneedle patches from cosmetic companies that promise to smooth your skin and remove wrinkles. Zehrung says, for vaccines and other medical applications, there are still questions about just how well the patches will work. Initial studies are encouraging but not definitive. And then there's the question about whether they can be manufactured at scale for a reasonable cost. Zehrung has been banging the drum for microneedle patches for 15 years, largely because he thinks they would provide a better way to distribute vaccines globally. ZEHRUNG: I am more optimistic than I have been in the past. I think we're getting closer. PALCA: The world would be the beneficiary if he's right. Joe Palca, NPR News.

That has changed now. Here's what Dr. Anthony Fauci told the Senate Appropriations Committee yesterday. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)ANTHONY FAUCI: The historical basis for pandemics evolving naturally from an animal reservoir is extremely strong. And it's for that reason that we felt that something similar like this has a much higher likelihood. No one knows - not even I - 100% at this point, which is the reason why we are in favor of further investigation. MARTIN: We've got Dr. Celine Gounder with us on the line. She's an infectious disease expert in New York City and recently served on the Biden-Harris transition team on their COVID-19 advisory board. Dr. Gounder, thanks for being here. CELINE GOUNDER: It's great to be here. MARTIN: Why do you think the Biden administration and the scientific community are now willing to take the lab leak theory seriously where they weren't before? GOUNDER: Well, I think Stephen Morris (ph) raised an important point, which is that some of this got conflated with conspiracy theories and China-bashing. But there was another point to make here, which is there was also conflation - confusion between this idea of a lab accident and intentionally engineering something in a lab and then that being accidentally or intentionally released. So, you know, I think what we've realized is that, you know, maybe a lab accident is certainly possible. And the other thing that raised that concern is that we now know that back in November, there were three researchers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology who were working on coronaviruses and who were hospitalized with symptoms that could have been from COVID, could've been from the flu, could've been from something else. But we don't have enough information on those three cases. And that is something that needs to be investigated. MARTIN: So speaking of which - I mean, that information about their history. But what other data would scientists need to assess the likelihood of a lab leak? GOUNDER: Well, you would really want to be going through the safety protocols in the lab. You would want to be going through their lab records. What exactly were the experiments that they were doing? You know, every scientist keeps very careful, detailed logs of their work. You know, and then were there any other illnesses amongst the group? We have no knowledge of what testing was done on those three sick researchers. We don't know what laboratory testing, what radiology, you know, scans were done. Were any specimens saved that you could go back and see, was this COVID or was this something else? So there's really a lot that would need to be done to further suss this out. MARTIN: So can any of that be known without China's cooperation? GOUNDER: Well, that's the challenge, right? So they have to either cooperate - and we'd have to achieve that through diplomatic means. Or, you know, our intelligence community may have other means of trying to get to that information. But we really cannot get to a definitive answer without that information. MARTIN: So why is the theory that COVID-19 likely came from a natural transmission, from animals to humans, why is it still the dominant one? GOUNDER: Well, this is really, 99% of the time, the source of emerging infectious diseases. Whether you talk about HIV or Zika or Ebola, the original SARS, MERS - I mean, you could keep going and going. But all of these have been the result of zoonotic spillover, so spillover of viruses from animals into humans. And, you know, this is what we've seen with prior coronaviruses. So probabilistically, it's far more likely that this would be a spillover event as well. MARTIN: Do you think it was a mistake not to take the lab leak theory seriously? GOUNDER: I think we need to investigate every single possibility that is plausible. Even if it's less likely, this needs more investigation. And saying that this needs more investigation doesn't mean the virus leaked from a lab. But we need to investigate that and figure that out because it really does have implications for how we'll prevent the next pandemic. MARTIN: The president wants urgency on this. But how does putting a 90-day deadline for the intelligence community to get an answer to this potentially affect the result? GOUNDER: You know, I'm not sure that we're going to be able to get an answer in 90 days. I think, you know, if you look at some of the other things that would need to be done to also assess a potential spillover, that would mean, for example, testing blood bank samples that would go back to before December, November of 2019. . . MARTIN: Yeah. GOUNDER: . . . To see if there was anything circulating previously. So there's a lot of work. I don't know if the 90 days is enough.

CHRISTOPHER CORNWALL: I've seen lots of people post pictures on the internet saying, look how great this reef is. SOMMER: What they don't realize, he says, is that they're actually looking at coral skeletons. The oceans have absorbed most of the heat from human-caused climate change, and corals bleach in marine heat waves, turning white in the extreme heat. In his work at Victoria University of Wellington, Cornwall has seen this repeatedly on Australia's Great Barrier Reef. CORNWALL: What happens is only a small fraction of that coral will be able to recover from those events, and a large proportion of those, depending on the heat stress, will die. SOMMER: Cornwall says the oceans are also becoming more acidic, which makes it harder for reefs to grow. He and his colleagues found that if humans lower their emissions dramatically, some reefs will make it. But at high or even moderate levels of emissions, the majority of coral reefs will stop growing by the end of the century. CORNWALL: If we miss this low-emission scenario target, the coral reefs are essentially doomed. SOMMER: That has many scientists looking for ways to help corals adapt. I reached scientist Joanie Kleypas of the National Center for Atmospheric Research while she was in Costa Rica. The corals have bleached there, too. But she saw some hope at one of her projects. JOANIE KLEYPAS: The corals survived. They were completely bleached for months and there was some mortality, but by and large, they survived. So they have some sort of secret. SOMMER: The secret could be that they're better at handling heat. Kleypas says scientists are looking for these corals all over the world in the hope that they could breed them and restore reefs. KLEYPAS: And if we act fast enough to execute that plan and we bring carbon dioxide emissions way down, then we do - we believe we have a chance. SOMMER: If emissions remain high, Kleypas says, even helping corals adapt won't be enough.

GREENFIELDBOYCE: The spiders were in plastic containers on her windowsill. One night, she came home after being out for dinner. ROESSLER: And I switched on the light. And I looked on the windowsill and was like, oh, God, what happened to these animals? Are they dead? GREENFIELDBOYCE: The spiders were hanging from the ceilings of their plastic boxes - just hanging by a single thread, suspended in midair, motionless. Roessler thought, what is this? It was very different than the little silken retreats that jumping spiders are known to build for resting in, say, rolled-up leaves. She went back out to the spot where she collected these spiders, this time at night. ROESSLER: We found a lot of them. So basically, we found three times the number of individuals during the nights compared to what we found during the day because it's just so easy to spot them when they hang from the vegetation like this. GREENFIELDBOYCE: It turns out the spiders spend hours at night hanging upside down. And if she gently touched the silk thread, almost all spiders would immediately drop to the ground. ROESSLER: Maybe they use their silk as a - kind of an alarm system or as a way of, like, getting out of reach for predators. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Like ants or other spiders - still, the spiders she had in boxes would sometimes make a little silk retreat for themselves. ROESSLER: And that meant that they were switching between different resting strategies. Something informs them about how to make this choice, where to spend the night, how to spend the night. GREENFIELDBOYCE: She's still trying to figure out what's going on but says this just goes to show that science knows very little about the nighttime resting habits of very tiny critters, even common ones.

AMITA SEHGAL: What I thought was really interesting was that they were talking about this suspension as being something that helps them avoid predation. We kind of talk about sleep as something that makes them more susceptible. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Because a sleeping animal isn't alert to danger - the sleep field has long focused on mammals and birds.

(SOUNDBITE OF BLOUSE'S \"FIRESTARTER\") MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:   One of the most common spiders you might see around your home is a jumping spider. They don't make webs. Instead, jumping spiders have four pairs of big eyes that help them spot prey and pounce. NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce reports scientists recently realized that at night, in the dark, these spiders do something unexpected. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE, BYLINE: Daniela Roessler had been doing experiments with jumping spiders at Harvard University. She wanted to understand whether and how jumping spiders recognize predators that might try to eat them. But then the pandemic hit, so she went home to Germany. And there, in a dry, grassy field, she went out and collected a different species of jumping spider. DANIELA ROESSLER: They have really cute, stripy faces.

MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:  But first, they needed an elephant. Zoo Atlanta was willing to help. The scientists presented an African elephant there with cubes of carrot, rutabaga and potato, which the elephant hoovered up with ease, as you can hear.

KELLY: Using those observations, along with some math, they calculated that elephants suck in air at more than 330 miles per hour. That is 30 times faster than a human sneeze. It is on par with the speed of a bullet train. The research was published by the Royal Society. SHAPIRO: And as for why the Army funded this work? Well, here's Schulz. SCHULZ: If you look at things like flexibility and strength, they're commonly as, like, opposites - right? - where if something's really flexible, it's not strong at all. SHAPIRO: He points out that elephant trunks are both of those things. KELLY: And David Hu says that makes trunks an ideal model for gentle robots, which might pick up fruit or help the elderly. HU: And so the Army was just fascinated by this idea of being, you know, gentle enough to pick up a peanut but strong enough to push down a door if you need to. SHAPIRO: As for whether humans can lift a tortilla chip by sniffing? Well, they did the math on that, too, and say it is likely infeasible. KELLY: Infeasible doesn't mean you can't try it at home.

CORTNI BORGERSON: A really delightful, small meat item. SHAPIRO: That's Dr. Cortni Borgerson. She's a professor of anthropology at Montclair State University. She doesn't study cicadas; she just likes eating them, pan-fried. BORGERSON: It's very similar to kind of a cross between a light pork flavor and something kind of nutty, like sunflower seeds. SHAPIRO: Borgerson says this Brood X emergence is the perfect time to take a bite or more of cicada. KELLY: Before you pop that first one in your mouth, though, people with shellfish allergies should refrain. BORGERSON: They're all arthropods. So if you're allergic to other types of crustaceans or shellfish, then that's in the same family as other insects. So you should be avoiding insects. SHAPIRO: OK, let's say you've cleared the allergy hurdle. There are still a couple more things to consider. KELLY: Yeah, like where have they been? Remember; the cicadas have been underground 17 years, which means they may have been soaking in not-so-lovely chemicals and pesticides. BORGERSON: I would never select a place to harvest cicadas where I wasn't comfortable gardening. So you want to think about - is there any potential for heavy metal contamination in the soil? What types of pesticides are being used? And the history of land use as well. SHAPIRO: Then once you found a good spot, the question is, which ones do you want to grab? BORGERSON: My perfect choice for a cicada, what I'm looking for, is a teneral cicada. SHAPIRO: That's science speak for freshly molting. BORGERSON: They do a backbend, and they unfurl their wings. It's like watching a butterfly emerge from a cocoon. It's incredible. They're really pale. That pale stage is what you really want to harvest. KELLY: That's because they are softer, which Borgerson says allows them to cook more evenly. Now, the nymphal stage - that's when they look like little beans just emerged from the ground - that is her second favorite stage to eat. SHAPIRO: Once you've grabbed a stash of cicadas, don't leave them out on your counter for too long. If you don't plan to cook them right away, Borgerson suggests freezing them to keep them fresh. KELLY: If you're like D. C. resident Tucker Jones, it also gives you time to get used to the idea. He has foraged for plants to eat before, but this was his first time harvesting bugs. TUCKER JONES: I kept them kind of in my freezer for a week after harvesting because even after all of that, I was still a little squeamish. SHAPIRO: So what helped him take that first bite? JONES: A woman who I was on a date with was interested in this, and so she came over, and we together cleaned the cicadas and then oiled them, stir-fried them and served them over grits. And I have my leftovers now. They turned out pretty good, I think. It has a little bit of a crunch to it, but it's not like there is, like, the sort of feeling of popcorn kernels stuck between your teeth. SHAPIRO: Yeah, but what we really want to know is, how was the date? KELLY: Yeah, and was there a second one? (Laughter). (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:   If you haven't already heard. . .

During the Inquisition, for example, it even accused scientists such as Galileo of heresy. But an hour's drive south of Rome, there's the one and only Vatican institution that does scientific research. As NPR's Sylvia Poggioli reports, the Vatican Observatory recently launched a campaign to promote dialogue between faith and science. SYLVIA POGGIOLI, BYLINE: Brother Guy Consolmagno, director of the Vatican Observatory, drives through the majestic gardens and olive groves of the papal summer residence in Castel Gandolfo. The observatory, whose roots go back to the 16th century, is nestled among cypresses near the remains of a Roman villa. GUY CONSOLMAGNO: This is the end that has the papal farm. So you can see the cows that the papal milk comes from. POGGIOLI: Run by Jesuits, the observatory moved to this bucolic setting in the 1930s when light pollution in Rome obstructed celestial observation. A huge telescope dating from 1891 stands under a dome ceiling. CONSOLMAGNO: And it was one of about 18 identical telescopes that were set up around the world to photograph the sky, one of the first international projects of astronomy. POGGIOLI: A native of Detroit, Consolmagno studied physics at MIT, volunteered with the Peace Corps in Africa and taught physics before becoming a Jesuit brother in his 40s. He's been at the observatory for three decades. His passion for astronomy started with a childhood love of science fiction. CONSOLMAGNO: I love the kind of science fiction that gives you that sense of wonder, that reminds you at the end of the day why we dream of being able to go into space. POGGIOLI: Some of the world's most important scientists come to teach at the observatory's summer school. It has hosted scientists and space industry leaders for a U. N. -sponsored conference on the ethics and peaceful uses of outer space. It cooperates with NASA on several space missions, and it operates a modern telescope in partnership with the University of Arizona. CONSOLMAGNO: But where we still need to work is with the rest of the world, the people in the pews, especially nowadays. There are too many people in the pews who think you have to choose between science and faith. POGGIOLI: To reach those people, the Vatican Observatory recently launched a new website and podcasts exploring issues such as meteorites hitting the Earth or how to live on the moon. As to how the faith-versus-science culture wars can be resolved, Brother Guy says what's most important is that he wears a collar, a devoutly religious person who is also an orthodox scientist. CONSOLMAGNO: That fact alone shatters the stereotypes. POGGIOLI: Another American at the observatory shattering stereotypes is Brother Bob Macke, curator of the collection of meteorites, rocks formed in the early days of the solar system. Pointing to a dark rock a few inches long lying on his desk, he says it was formed 4 1/2 billion years ago, providing clues on how the solar system was formed. BOB MACKE: In order to understand the natural world, you have to study the natural world. You cannot just simply close your eyes and ignore it or pretend that it is other than it is. You have to study it. And you have to come to appreciate it. POGGIOLI: Brother Guy Consolmagno, asked how the study of the stars interacts with his faith, says astronomy doesn't provide answers to theological questions. And Scripture doesn't explain science. CONSOLMAGNO: But the astronomy is the place where I interact with the creator of the universe, where God sets up the puzzles. And we have a lot of fun solving them together. POGGIOLI: And he believes the recent dark period of the pandemic has weakened the arguments of those who are skeptical of science. CONSOLMAGNO: Because people can see science in action. Science doesn't have all the answers. And yet science is still - with all of its mistakes, with all of its stumbling, is still better than no science.

We started the hour with a story about sea urchins. We'll end with another terrifying but unassuming creature. MANDE HOLFORD: I call them killer snails. I love to call them killer snails, I mean, because that's what they do, right? They kill things. ZOMORODI: This is venom scientist Mande Holford. She studies cone snails, a group of venomous predatory snails found all over the world and at all depths of the ocean. HOLFORD: They are net hunters, so they open their rostrums, which their mouths, really wide, like you're going to, you know, swallow something. And they are. They're going to swallow fish. So they usually eat a school of fish. So they open their mouths really wide, engulf the fish, and then they start to individually harpoon the fish with venom once they're in their mouth. ZOMORODI: So they sting the fish. Or if you disturb them, they'll sting you, right? And then what happens? How does the venom work? HOLFORD: So inside of venom, you have peptides that are very specific to what they do. And I like to say that they target blood, brains and membranes. They come at you all at once, and they are trying to shut down or disrupt the normal physiology of the prey so that you're in sort of this excited shock state. Or they're ripping membranes apart, so they're tearing apart the different membranes on the cells. And so. . . ZOMORODI: It's violent. HOLFORD: It's very violent (laughter). It's very violent in your body. Your body doesn't know what's hit it. . . ZOMORODI: Wow. HOLFORD: . . . Right? But it's designed so to be this all-powerful shock-and-awe kind of campaign that happens when it's injected into the prey, where it's fanning out to hit these, you know, molecular targets, hit these ion channels on membranes of cells to disrupt how they would normally function. And so you should be cautious of them, you know, when you encounter them on the beach because from the source of where they're injected, it starts to get sort of paralyzed. And that paralysis creeps up to your diaphragm eventually and prevents you from being able to breathe normally. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)HOLFORD: And so you die from that and some also from the heart attack of just realizing that you can't breathe as well. ZOMORODI: (Laughter) OK, at this point, I do not feel like writing these things a love letter. But, Mande, you are really deeply in love with these snails and with what they can do, right? HOLFORD: (Laughter) You know, we think of snails as supervillains because they feed on fish, snails and worms, and their venom can be lethal to humans, too, right? So a snail can kill a human. But we also think of them as superheroes because if we tease out the components in their venom, we can identify therapeutics that are very effective against pain and cancer. And that's how we're able to use venom from snails as a superpower for good. ZOMORODI: Here's more from Mande Holford on the therapeutic properties of venom in her TED talk. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)HOLFORD: Sounds like a stretch, or maybe even snake oil, but actually, while there are snakes involved, the product is legit. The toxins work with the precision of a Swiss Army knife. Are there other things that I would like to use venom to attack? For sure. And one of those is cancer. Cancer tumors are cells. And like all cells, they communicate with themselves and their environment around them. So we would like to find venom components that are very good at disrupting how the tumor cells communicate. The cancer that we're most focused on right now is liver cancer. We found a compound from a terebrid snail that seems to attack liver cancer cells. And then when we took this compound and we injected it into mouse models that were expressing liver cancer cells, it significantly inhibited the growth of the tumors. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)HOLFORD: Basically, what we think is happening is that the compound is blocking a specific channel prohibiting the transmission of a specific chemical that leads to downstream signaling that enables the tumor to multiply and draw blood to itself. ZOMORODI: So just to sum up - the components in venom that kill prey are exactly what makes it possible to target specific illnesses and potentially treat them. HOLFORD: Yes, exactly. ZOMORODI: Wild. And I know that your lab is working on using sea snails for cancer treatments. But there are some other medications made from venom already that are on the market, right? Where are we in terms of what is out there, what's gotten approved and what's hopefully still on the way? HOLFORD: So for our peptide, we're still a ways away from getting it into clinical trials 'cause we have to prove the mechanism of how it works and all of that. But currently, there are at least six different drugs that have been approved by the FDA that are on the market that are either the venom peptide itself or derived from venom peptides that you can go and get a prescription for from a doctor. ZOMORODI: Wow. HOLFORD: You can find venom in lots of creatures. Venom is found all throughout the tree of life, so, you know, snakes, spiders, scorpions. So the six that are currently on the market - one is from cone snail. It's a pain therapy called Prialt that they use for chronic pain in HIV and cancer patients. One from the Brazilian pit viper is Captopril. And they use it for hypertension. From the Gila monster, there's Exenatide, which is used to lower blood sugar in diabetes. From the medicinal leech, we find something called Angiomax, and they use it for blood thinning. And then we have something from another viper, Aggrastat, which is also a blood thinner. And then the pygmy rattlesnake gives you another blood thinner. So those six. So we've got three snakes, a leech, a snail and a Gila monster. ZOMORODI: That is quite a group of pharmacists you've got there. So what is your hope for them in the next, say, five to 10 years? HOLFORD: Oh, my God. In the next five, 10 years, I think the venom field is going to really explode. I really think we're at a point in which the technology has advanced so much that it's enabled us to be able to study these fields, study these organisms in ways that are less invasive, so we don't need as many, right? And also, we can get so much depth in terms of what their genes are doing and how the genes are made. And for that - that I think is the most exciting part, is we are interested in looking for things that would give us pain therapies that are nonaddictive or looking for ways in which we can talk about treating cancer that would be easier for the patient - so looking for selective treatments for cancer that did not have the side effect that all the current treatments have, which is that they're really horrible. They're just as bad as the disease. ZOMORODI: Yeah. HOLFORD: So those were our two sort of marching orders when we wanted to use venom for good. Can we find a pain therapeutic that is not addictive - so an alternative to the opioids to address the opioid crisis? And can we identify a cancer treatment that was selected for tumors versus healthy cells so that patients don't have to go through this agony when they're going on their cancer treatment? (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)HOLFORD: There's so much more venom out there for us to study. In fact, we think that 15% of all the animals on the planet are venomous. And I think this is a low estimate given the fact that we haven't surveyed all the animals on the planet. But nature seems to have found something that she likes, and she's repeated it over and over and over again, leading to the vast array of animals that we see around us and all throughout the tree of life. We're in a race to harness all of this venom goodness before we lose the vast majority of animals on our planet. It's a holistic process. You can't have the therapeutic treatments without having the animals, and you can't have the animals without having their ecosystems. So for me and the snails, what it means is we have to save the oceans. And because venomous animals are found everywhere, we basically have to save the planet. So do it for the venomous animals if you don't want to do it for yourself. ZOMORODI: I want to tie this back to what our episode is all about, which is this idea of our love of the ocean, our need to remind ourselves there are lots of reasons to invest in saving the ocean. And the reasons that you're describing are - kind of appeal to our self-interest in many ways. You know, whether we will suffer from cancer or diabetes or high blood pressure, these are all things that humans desperately could use treatment for. And so we need - is this - is that an OK reason to want to preserve the oceans? HOLFORD: Oh, yes. No, altruism is a good thing. But self-interest is even better. And so when. . . (LAUGHTER)HOLFORD: . . . People think that this can help me, I want it, then they seem to, you know, behave accordingly. And so, yes, whatever the motivation for saving the oceans, we've got to do it, right? And in this case, these snails are helping to make our lives possible by allowing us to find novel treatments for ailments that are not going away, right? ZOMORODI: Yeah. HOLFORD: And if that isn't enough, if it isn't enough to say that, hey, my dad or my mom, who - or myself, who is this cancer patient suffering, and I know a snail that can help that, and in order for me to get that snail what it needs, I've got to not pollute my ocean, I'm going to say yes to that 'cause I want my mom around, or I want to be around myself. And so I think bringing in the story of how we tie nature in humanity is a powerful one for how we're going to be able to maybe change behaviors and protect our oceans. ZOMORODI: That's venom scientist Mande Holford. You can see her full talk at ted. com. And there is more of our love for the oceans coming soon. Join us in two weeks for part two on the ocean, ideas on how to protect the seas and all the amazing marine life that lives in them. Thank you so much for joining us today.

I'm Manoush Zomorodi, and you've been listening to the TED Radio Hour from NPR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MANOUSH ZOMORODI, HOST:   On the show today, a love letter to the ocean, even to its less lovable inhabitants. We started the hour with a story about sea urchins. We'll end with another terrifying but unassuming creature. MANDE HOLFORD: I call them killer snails. I love to call them killer snails, I mean, because that's what they do, right? They kill things. ZOMORODI: This is venom scientist Mande Holford. She studies cone snails, a group of venomous predatory snails found all over the world and at all depths of the ocean. HOLFORD: They are net hunters, so they open their rostrums, which their mouths, really wide, like you're going to, you know, swallow something. And they are. They're going to swallow fish. So they usually eat a school of fish. So they open their mouths really wide, engulf the fish, and then they start to individually harpoon the fish with venom once they're in their mouth. ZOMORODI: So they sting the fish. Or if you disturb them, they'll sting you, right? And then what happens? How does the venom work? HOLFORD: So inside of venom, you have peptides that are very specific to what they do. And I like to say that they target blood, brains and membranes. They come at you all at once, and they are trying to shut down or disrupt the normal physiology of the prey so that you're in sort of this excited shock state. Or they're ripping membranes apart, so they're tearing apart the different membranes on the cells. And so. . . ZOMORODI: It's violent. HOLFORD: It's very violent (laughter). It's very violent in your body. Your body doesn't know what's hit it. . . ZOMORODI: Wow. HOLFORD: . . . Right? But it's designed so to be this all-powerful shock-and-awe kind of campaign that happens when it's injected into the prey, where it's fanning out to hit these, you know, molecular targets, hit these ion channels on membranes of cells to disrupt how they would normally function. And so you should be cautious of them, you know, when you encounter them on the beach because from the source of where they're injected, it starts to get sort of paralyzed. And that paralysis creeps up to your diaphragm eventually and prevents you from being able to breathe normally. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) HOLFORD: And so you die from that and some also from the heart attack of just realizing that you can't breathe as well. ZOMORODI: (Laughter) OK, at this point, I do not feel like writing these things a love letter. But, Mande, you are really deeply in love with these snails and with what they can do, right? HOLFORD: (Laughter) You know, we think of snails as supervillains because they feed on fish, snails and worms, and their venom can be lethal to humans, too, right? So a snail can kill a human. But we also think of them as superheroes because if we tease out the components in their venom, we can identify therapeutics that are very effective against pain and cancer. And that's how we're able to use venom from snails as a superpower for good. ZOMORODI: Here's more from Mande Holford on the therapeutic properties of venom in her TED talk. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) HOLFORD: Sounds like a stretch, or maybe even snake oil, but actually, while there are snakes involved, the product is legit. The toxins work with the precision of a Swiss Army knife. Are there other things that I would like to use venom to attack? For sure. And one of those is cancer. Cancer tumors are cells. And like all cells, they communicate with themselves and their environment around them. So we would like to find venom components that are very good at disrupting how the tumor cells communicate. The cancer that we're most focused on right now is liver cancer. We found a compound from a terebrid snail that seems to attack liver cancer cells. And then when we took this compound and we injected it into mouse models that were expressing liver cancer cells, it significantly inhibited the growth of the tumors. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) HOLFORD: Basically, what we think is happening is that the compound is blocking a specific channel prohibiting the transmission of a specific chemical that leads to downstream signaling that enables the tumor to multiply and draw blood to itself. ZOMORODI: So just to sum up - the components in venom that kill prey are exactly what makes it possible to target specific illnesses and potentially treat them. HOLFORD: Yes, exactly. ZOMORODI: Wild. And I know that your lab is working on using sea snails for cancer treatments. But there are some other medications made from venom already that are on the market, right? Where are we in terms of what is out there, what's gotten approved and what's hopefully still on the way? HOLFORD: So for our peptide, we're still a ways away from getting it into clinical trials 'cause we have to prove the mechanism of how it works and all of that. But currently, there are at least six different drugs that have been approved by the FDA that are on the market that are either the venom peptide itself or derived from venom peptides that you can go and get a prescription for from a doctor. ZOMORODI: Wow. HOLFORD: You can find venom in lots of creatures. Venom is found all throughout the tree of life, so, you know, snakes, spiders, scorpions. So the six that are currently on the market - one is from cone snail. It's a pain therapy called Prialt that they use for chronic pain in HIV and cancer patients. One from the Brazilian pit viper is Captopril. And they use it for hypertension. From the Gila monster, there's Exenatide, which is used to lower blood sugar in diabetes. From the medicinal leech, we find something called Angiomax, and they use it for blood thinning. And then we have something from another viper, Aggrastat, which is also a blood thinner. And then the pygmy rattlesnake gives you another blood thinner. So those six. So we've got three snakes, a leech, a snail and a Gila monster. ZOMORODI: That is quite a group of pharmacists you've got there. So what is your hope for them in the next, say, five to 10 years? HOLFORD: Oh, my God. In the next five, 10 years, I think the venom field is going to really explode. I really think we're at a point in which the technology has advanced so much that it's enabled us to be able to study these fields, study these organisms in ways that are less invasive, so we don't need as many, right? And also, we can get so much depth in terms of what their genes are doing and how the genes are made. And for that - that I think is the most exciting part, is we are interested in looking for things that would give us pain therapies that are nonaddictive or looking for ways in which we can talk about treating cancer that would be easier for the patient - so looking for selective treatments for cancer that did not have the side effect that all the current treatments have, which is that they're really horrible. They're just as bad as the disease. ZOMORODI: Yeah. HOLFORD: So those were our two sort of marching orders when we wanted to use venom for good. Can we find a pain therapeutic that is not addictive - so an alternative to the opioids to address the opioid crisis? And can we identify a cancer treatment that was selected for tumors versus healthy cells so that patients don't have to go through this agony when they're going on their cancer treatment? (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) HOLFORD: There's so much more venom out there for us to study. In fact, we think that 15% of all the animals on the planet are venomous. And I think this is a low estimate given the fact that we haven't surveyed all the animals on the planet. But nature seems to have found something that she likes, and she's repeated it over and over and over again, leading to the vast array of animals that we see around us and all throughout the tree of life. We're in a race to harness all of this venom goodness before we lose the vast majority of animals on our planet. It's a holistic process. You can't have the therapeutic treatments without having the animals, and you can't have the animals without having their ecosystems. So for me and the snails, what it means is we have to save the oceans. And because venomous animals are found everywhere, we basically have to save the planet. So do it for the venomous animals if you don't want to do it for yourself. ZOMORODI: I want to tie this back to what our episode is all about, which is this idea of our love of the ocean, our need to remind ourselves there are lots of reasons to invest in saving the ocean. And the reasons that you're describing are - kind of appeal to our self-interest in many ways. You know, whether we will suffer from cancer or diabetes or high blood pressure, these are all things that humans desperately could use treatment for. And so we need - is this - is that an OK reason to want to preserve the oceans? HOLFORD: Oh, yes. No, altruism is a good thing. But self-interest is even better. And so when. . . (LAUGHTER) HOLFORD: . . . People think that this can help me, I want it, then they seem to, you know, behave accordingly. And so, yes, whatever the motivation for saving the oceans, we've got to do it, right? And in this case, these snails are helping to make our lives possible by allowing us to find novel treatments for ailments that are not going away, right? ZOMORODI: Yeah. HOLFORD: And if that isn't enough, if it isn't enough to say that, hey, my dad or my mom, who - or myself, who is this cancer patient suffering, and I know a snail that can help that, and in order for me to get that snail what it needs, I've got to not pollute my ocean, I'm going to say yes to that 'cause I want my mom around, or I want to be around myself.

I'm Manoush Zomorodi. On the show today, a love letter to the sea. And we often hear from scientists on the show who adore their research subjects. But marine biologist Ayana Elizabeth Johnson is really obsessed with one particular fish. In 2019, Ayana gave a talk that was both a declaration of her love for the parrotfish and an urgent plea to save them and their home. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)AYANA ELIZABETH JOHNSON: I want to tell you a love story. But it doesn't have a happy ending. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)JOHNSON: Once upon a time, I was a stubborn 5-year-old who decided to become a marine biologist. 34 years, 400 scuba dives and 1 Ph. D. later, I'm still completely enamored with the ocean. I spent a decade working with fishing communities in the Caribbean, counting fish, interviewing fishermen, redesigning fishing gear and developing policy. I've been helping to figure out what sustainable management can look like for places where food security, jobs and cultures all depend on the sea. In the midst of all this, I fell in love with a fish. There are over 500 fish species that live on Caribbean reefs. But the ones I just can't get out of my head are parrotfish. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)JOHNSON: Parrotfish live on coral reefs all over the world. There are 100 species. They can grow well over a meter long and weigh over 20 kilograms. But that's the boring stuff. I want to tell you five incredible things about these fish. First, they have a mouth like a parrot's beak, which is strong enough to bite coral. But mostly they're after algae. They are the lawnmowers of the reef. This is key because many reefs are overgrown with algae due to nutrient pollution from sewage and fertilizer that runs off of land. And there just aren't enough herbivores, like parrotfish, left out on the reefs to mow it all down. OK. Second amazing thing - after all that eating, they poop fine, white sand. A single parrotfish can produce over 380 kilograms of this pulverized coral each year. Sometimes when scuba diving I would look up from my clipboard and just see contrails of parrotfish poop raining down. So next time you're lounging on a tropical white sand beach, maybe think of parrotfish. (LAUGHTER)JOHNSON: Third, they have so much style. Mottled and striped, teal, magenta, yellow, orange, polka-dotted, parrotfish are a big part of what makes coral reefs so colorful. Plus, in true diva style, they have multiple wardrobe changes throughout their life - a juvenile outfit, an intermediate getup and a terminal look. Fourth, with this last wardrobe change comes a sex change from female to male termed sequential hermaphroditism. These large males then gather harems of females to spawn. Heterosexual monogamy is certainly not nature's status quo. Fifth, and the most incredible - sometimes when parrotfish cozy up into a nook in the reef at night, they secrete a mucus bubble from a gland in their head that envelops their entire body. This masks their scent from predators and protects them from parasites so they can sleep soundly. I mean, how cool is this? (LAUGHTER)JOHNSON: So this is a confession of my love for parrotfish in all their flamboyant, algae-eating, sand-pooping, sex-changing glory. But with this love comes heartache. Now that groupers and snappers are woefully overfished, fishermen are targeting parrotfish. Spearfishing took out the large species. Midnight blue and rainbow parrotfish are now exceedingly rare, and nets and traps are scooping up the smaller species. And then there's my love for their home, the coral reef, which was once as vibrant as Caribbean cultures, as colorful as the architecture and as bustling as Carnival. Because of climate change, on top of overfishing and pollution, coral reefs may be gone within 30 years. An entire ecosystem, erased. We're in the midst of the sixth mass extinction, and we humans are causing it. We also have the solutions. Every bit of habitat we preserve, every tenth of a degree of warming we prevent, really does matter. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)JOHNSON: A little bit of good news is that places like Belize, Barbuda and Bonaire are protecting these VIPs - very important parrotfish. Also, more and more places are establishing protected areas that protect the entire ecosystem. These are critical efforts. But it's not enough. I am never going to give up working to protect and restore this magnificent planet because I don't know how to give an honest talk about my beloved parrotfish and coral reefs that has a happy ending.

I'm Manoush Zomorodi. And today's show is a Love Letter to the Ocean. (SOUNDBITE OF COLE PORTER SONG, \"LET'S DO IT\")ZOMORODI: You know, I have had this song stuck in my head since I watched your talk. Would it be OK if I played it for you? MARAH HARDT: Yeah, I'm game. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"LET'S DO IT\")COLE PORTER: (Singing) Romantic sponges, they say, do it. ZOMORODI: Do you recognize it? (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"LET'S DO IT\")PORTER: (Singing) Oysters down in Oyster Bay do it. HARDT: I do. This is the great Cole Porter's \"Let's Fall In Love. \"ZOMORODI: \"Let's Do It, Let's Fall In Love. \"HARDT: \"Let's Do It. \" That's right. \"Let's Do It, Let's Fall In Love. \" Yeah, he's actually a little dirtier than I'm giving him credit for (laughter). (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"LET'S DO IT\")PORTER: (Singing) Even lazy jellyfish do it. ZOMORODI: This is Marah Hardt. She's a marine biologist and an author. HARDT: The name of my book is \"Sex In The Sea: Our Intimate Connection With Sex-Changing Fish, Romantic Lobsters, Kinky Squid And Other Salty Erotica Of The Deep. \"(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"LET'S DO IT\")PORTER: (Singing) Why ask if shad do it? ZOMORODI: I mean, the song just goes on and on about electric eels doing it, lazy jellyfish doing it, goldfish in the privacy of their bowls doing it. HARDT: Yeah. ZOMORODI: What's your reaction to that song as a person who specializes in the sex lives of fish? HARDT: Oh, well, I rock out to that song. It's fantastic. ZOMORODI: (Laughter). HARDT: But it completely misses so much of the more colorful and honestly kinky components because the fun part isn't that they do it. The fascinating and fun and important part is how they do it. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)HARDT: For example, clownfish. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"FINDING NEMO\")ALBERT BROOKS: (As Marlin) Nemo. ALEXANDER GOULD: (As Nemo) First day of school. BROOKS: (As Marlin) Nemo, don't move. Don't move. You'll never get out of there. HARDT: Everybody knows \"Finding Nemo. \" They know clownfish. But what they don't realize is that clownfish species all start life - any individual that's born starts life as a male. And then later in life, he transitions into a female. ZOMORODI: Really? HARDT: Yeah, yeah. And they pair up - a male and a female will pair up. And for them to make the most babies, what they want is for the bigger of the two to be female. And this is because unlike in mammals where - for example, with humans - right? - a woman is born with all the eggs she will ever have, in fish, the bigger the female is, the more eggs she can carry. And since sperm is really cheap to make, a small male energetically can make a lot of sperm. He can make enough sperm to fertilize all of a large female's eggs. (SOUNDBITE OF DEEP SEA WATER)HARDT: And what's happening is the female is actually sort of doing this psychological warfare, and she kind of bullies her mate, the male. And she kind of keeps him from sort of getting too aggressive where he would actually then begin to transition into a female. He then bullies all these smaller males to say don't you guys get any wrong ideas about competing with me for access to this female's eggs. So his bullying kind of keeps the juveniles in this almost, like, suspended premature state. And then when that female dies, the male can very quickly transition into a female. And then the next largest juvenile matures into a male. And then they will become the mating couple. And nobody has to leave the anemone and go find a date or a mate, which is much safer. ZOMORODI: That is crazy. HARDT: It's crazy (laughter). (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ZOMORODI: Who knew that clownfish could be so intriguing? HARDT: You just can't make this stuff up. You know, nature has the best imagination of all. ZOMORODI: But the fact that you and I and most people know very little about how clownfish mate and very rarely think about how marine life reproduce, Marah says that's a problem. HARDT: Because these animals reproduce in a different way, our actions affect the success of sex in the sea in ways that we might not anticipate right when it's most important. ZOMORODI: So for clownfish - they're often caught and sold as aquarium pets. HARDT: And the bigger fish - right? - are the ones that tend to be the more attractive for sale. So if you imagine on a reef, you go around and you start pulling off all the big clownfish, you're taking all the females. ZOMORODI: And taking all the females completely disrupts the life cycle of an entire school of clownfish. HARDT: You skew the sex ratio. You're making it harder for those individuals that are left behind to actually find their mates, or you're forcing them to transition in a - under conditions sooner than they would. And that's it's going to actually decrease the amount of offspring that is being produced. ZOMORODI: Which causes a ripple effect for every creature connected to the clownfish. So just imagine how we are messing with the mating habits of all kinds of marine life, the ones we know about and the ones we don't. HARDT: It's so varied, the way that animals have sex in the sea. And it's so different that we really need to take that step back and start to shift the way that we act and shift some of our behaviors so that we can respect the way that life reproduces there rather than thwarting them. (SOUNDBITE OF WAVES CRASHING)ZOMORODI: All to say, we need to know how marine life do it. And so now let's dive deeper and move from the coral reefs of the South Pacific down to the cold, cold romantic waters off the coast of Maine. (SOUNDBITE OF TEDx TALK)HARDT: Take Maine lobster. They don't look that romantic or that kinky. They are both. ZOMORODI: Here's Marah Hardt on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TEDx TALK)HARDT: During mating season, female lobsters want to mate with the biggest, baddest males. But these guys are really aggressive, and they'll attack any lobster that approaches, male or female. Meanwhile, the best time for her to mate with a male is right after she's molted, when she's lost her hard shell. So she has to approach this aggressive guy in her most vulnerable state. What's a girl to do? (LAUGHTER)HARDT: Her answer - spray him in the face repeatedly with her urine. (LAUGHTER)HARDT: Mmm hmm. Under the sea, pee is a very powerful love potion. (LAUGHTER)HARDT: Conveniently, lobsters' bladders sit just above their brains, and they have two nozzles under their eyestalk with which they can shoot their urine forward. So the female approaches the male's den. And as he charges out, she lets loose a stream of urine and then gets the hell out of there. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)HARDT: Only a few days of this daily dosing is all it takes for her scent to have a transformative effect. The male turns from an aggressive to a gentle lover. By the week's end, he invites her into his den. ZOMORODI: OK. So urine as an aphrodisiac, also kind of a chill pill - so he invites her in for a nightcap. Is that kind of it? They go for it? HARDT: So she will occupy the den with him, and they'll hang out for a while - a couple of days. They'll hunt. They'll feed. They'll sleep, do their. . . ZOMORODI: Wow. HARDT: . . . Lobster stuff. And then when she feels that her molt is imminent, she will circle around front of him. And then they go through this wonderful ritual. He sort of bows his head down and puts his big claws out in the sand, and she sort of rises herself up. And she takes one of her big claws, and she'll tap him on one shoulder and then the other. ZOMORODI: What? HARDT: And we call this - yeah. We call this knighting 'cause it really looks like that. And we. . . ZOMORODI: You are chosen. HARDT: You are chosen. And we're pretty sure it means, not only are - you are chosen, but don't go anywhere 'cause all of this is about to happen. ZOMORODI: Oh. HARDT: She then goes to the back of the den. And for the next few hours, she will molt. So she sort of slips out of her shell if you will. That whole time, the male guards over her. He'll walk back and forth from the front of the den to her. He'll sort of stroke her with his antenna and his walking legs, his small legs. And lobsters - their taste buds are on their feet, on their - those little legs. So he's actually kind of like tasting her, licking her. That's where, like, the kinky part comes in. So he's sort of guarding over her, tasting her, caring for her. And then she sort of gives him a signal that she's ready. And now, at this point, she literally is like a blob. She can't support her own weight. She cannot stand up. She can't really move. And so he scoops her up using his walking legs and forms almost like a hammock and holds her and rolls her over so that they're belly to belly - basically in the missionary position - and sort of cradles her there. And then he inserts these two special little fins that he has sort of at the base of his tail that slot into that pouch, and he delivers his sperm packet. And then he very gently lays her back down, and that's it. That's the sex. But then for the next few days, he will guard the front of that den while her new shell is hardening. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)HARDT: And then when she's ready, she stands up, says thank you very much, leaves the den. They probably never see each other again. And then the next female will arrive at his doorstep and start spraying him in the face with her pee, and the whole thing repeats. ZOMORODI: It's like marine erotica kind of. Like, it's. . . HARDT: So, right. You go down a lot of rabbit holes when you're. . . ZOMORODI: Yes. HARDT: . . . Writing a book about sex in the sea. And I would never want anyone to look at the history of my computer. I'd be terrified at what they'd find. (LAUGHTER)ZOMORODI: So in terms of the role that humans are playing in lobster sex - I mean, in terms of I guess I should say disrupting lobster sex, like, can you explain that? HARDT: Sure. So the ability for her love potion, for her urine to work as a love potion depends on her urine having certain chemical signals - right? - and the male having receptors that can receive those signals. And one of the things that we're doing in the ocean through climate change is we're making the oceans more acidic. We're actually changing the fundamental chemistry of seawater. That might scramble the message as it's passing through the seawater. And we know that more acidic seawater is known to damage certain kinds of receptor cells. It's affecting smell and chemical signaling in many species. So imagine if her love potion didn't work, right? That disrupts the whole strategy that lobster reproduction is based on. And it's not just climate change where this happens, right? If there's a big pollution event - you know, oil spill or runoff from land - that can change the chemical signature of water and mask or mess up the ability of animals to detect those scents. (SOUNDBITE OF TEDx TALK)HARDT: Dive deeper, and sex gets even stranger. (SOUNDBITE OF WATER BUBBLING)HARDT: Fanfin anglerfish live at about 3,000 feet below the surface in the pitch black waters. And the males are born without the ability to feed themselves. To survive, he has to find a female fast. Meanwhile, the female, who is 10 times bigger than the male - 10 times - she lets out a very strong pheromone with which to attract mates to her. So this tiny male is swimming through the black waters, smelling his way to a female. And when he finds her, he gives her a love bite. And this is when things get really weird. The bite itself triggers a whole bunch of chemical reactions. And the first is that, basically, his jawbone starts to dissolve. His tissue kind of starts to almost, like, melt and fuses with her body. Their circulatory systems entwine. And almost all of his internal organs start to dissolve. . . ZOMORODI: Wow. HARDT: . . . Except for his testes. His testes, actually, like, kick up into, like, full-blown maturity mode. And he starts producing sperm. (SOUNDBITE OF TEDx TALK)HARDT: In the end, he's basically a permanently attached, on-demand sperm factory for the female. (LAUGHTER)HARDT: It's a very efficient system. (LAUGHTER)HARDT: But this is not the kind of mating strategy that we see on a farm, right? I mean, this is weird. It's really strange. But if we don't know that these kind of strategies exist or how they work, we can't know what kind of impacts we may be having, even in the deep sea. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ZOMORODI: Presumably, with the anglerfish, this must have been one of the hardest discoveries to make. And if you don't know that these wild procreation activities are going on, then you can't know when you're impacting them, right? As humans, we don't know what we don't know. HARDT: It's - yeah, absolutely. We don't know what we don't know. So there's - I think there's two lessons there, so first is precautionary approach all the time. Assume you might be doing harm. And make sure that when you're putting a new behavior or new activity into place that you're proving no harm. In many places on land, if you're going to put up a development or you're going to allow industry to come in and do some sort of extractive activity, they have to do an environmental impact assessment. They have to show they're not going to hurt endangered species or disrupt the ecosystem. We don't tend to do that in the ocean. And some of that is because we think the oceans are endless and abundant forever. ZOMORODI: Right. HARDT: And now we know that's - right? - that's not the case. So taking a precautionary approach is really important - and correcting some behaviors that we know we've gotten wrong, so things like fishing on spawning aggregation. So again, for fish who release their sperm and eggs into the water, many of them form these annual, amazing, huge sex parties, right? They're like giant orgies. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)HARDT: And you'll have tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of fish that will all gather in one place at one time. Often, it's, like, a full moon party. They do - they love the full moon. There's reasons for that - but big, full moon sex party. And while they're reproducing, let them reproduce. That's not a good time to come in and fish. ZOMORODI: Right. HARDT: It's easy, right? For the fishers, it's easy because they can catch a lot of the biggest fish all at once. But you're tapping into the principal rather than taking the interest, right? You're actually cutting off the ability of that population to make more fish for you for the next year. ZOMORODI: Do you, like, use these examples and sort of the same sort of sexy language about fish, like, when you're talking to people who are overfishing or people who might be polluting the oceans? Like, are - do you say, like, let's talk about fish sex? HARDT: (Laughter). ZOMORODI: Is that your hook? HARDT: Some - (laughter) I tend to use the fish hook more with folks who I'm trying to get to just care, just genuinely start to awaken to the fact that they are connected to the ocean. I honestly - I can't tell you how many times in bars I've just, like, struck up a conversation with a stranger over this. ZOMORODI: (Laughter). HARDT: Right? Like, it's just - it's great bar trivia. And you can. . . ZOMORODI: You talk dirty to them. HARDT: You talk dirty. You can slide in a little fun factoid, and then you're off and running. And the thing that's so marvelous is that, honestly, people are curious about nature. They are curious about oceans. And whether they admit it or not, they are curious about sex. Everybody is. ZOMORODI: (Laughter). (SOUNDBITE OF BILL WIRGES AND HIS ORCHESTRA'S \"LET'S DO IT\")HARDT: And so it's a wonderful bridge to start to engage in those conversations without being heavy-handed, without it all being doom and gloom either - right? - 'cause just talking about collapse of our ocean ecosystems and the threat of climate change, that doesn't inspire. It doesn't bring solutions to the table. ZOMORODI: No. HARDT: Right? Instead it's like, wow, isn't this crazy? And what can we do to make sure that lobsters keep getting to have their kinky sex lives? (SOUNDBITE OF BILL WIRGES AND HIS ORCHESTRA'S \"LET'S DO IT\")ZOMORODI: Marah Hardt is a marine biologist and the author of the book \"Sex In The Sea. \" She's also a conservationist at the nonprofit Future of Fish. You can see her full talk at ted. com. I think it's time to update Cole Porter's lyrics. HARDT: (Laughter) I know. I was just thinking about that. I was like, you know, clownfish in there anemones do it. But they all start males and then transition to females, and there's this crazy psychological warfare where they control one another's maturation, and they're stuck in prepubescent limbo. You know, it doesn't really work. But. . . ZOMORODI: No. (LAUGHTER)ZOMORODI: On the show today, a Love Letter to the Ocean. I'm Manoush Zomorodi, and you're listening to the TED Radio Hour from NPR. MANOUSH ZOMORODI, HOST:   It's the TED Radio Hour from NPR. I'm Manoush Zomorodi. And today's show is a Love Letter to the Ocean. (SOUNDBITE OF COLE PORTER SONG, \"LET'S DO IT\") ZOMORODI: You know, I have had this song stuck in my head since I watched your talk. Would it be OK if I played it for you? MARAH HARDT: Yeah, I'm game. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"LET'S DO IT\") COLE PORTER: (Singing) Romantic sponges, they say, do it. ZOMORODI: Do you recognize it? (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"LET'S DO IT\") PORTER: (Singing) Oysters down in Oyster Bay do it. HARDT: I do. This is the great Cole Porter's \"Let's Fall In Love. \" ZOMORODI: \"Let's Do It, Let's Fall In Love. \" HARDT: \"Let's Do It. \" That's right. \"Let's Do It, Let's Fall In Love. \" Yeah, he's actually a little dirtier than I'm giving him credit for (laughter). (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"LET'S DO IT\") PORTER: (Singing) Even lazy jellyfish do it. ZOMORODI: This is Marah Hardt. She's a marine biologist and an author. HARDT: The name of my book is \"Sex In The Sea: Our Intimate Connection With Sex-Changing Fish, Romantic Lobsters, Kinky Squid And Other Salty Erotica Of The Deep. \" (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"LET'S DO IT\") PORTER: (Singing) Why ask if shad do it? ZOMORODI: I mean, the song just goes on and on about electric eels doing it, lazy jellyfish doing it, goldfish in the privacy of their bowls doing it. HARDT: Yeah. ZOMORODI: What's your reaction to that song as a person who specializes in the sex lives of fish? HARDT: Oh, well, I rock out to that song. It's fantastic. ZOMORODI: (Laughter). HARDT: But it completely misses so much of the more colorful and honestly kinky components because the fun part isn't that they do it. The fascinating and fun and important part is how they do it. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) HARDT: For example, clownfish. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"FINDING NEMO\") ALBERT BROOKS: (As Marlin) Nemo. ALEXANDER GOULD: (As Nemo) First day of school. BROOKS: (As Marlin) Nemo, don't move. Don't move. You'll never get out of there. HARDT: Everybody knows \"Finding Nemo. \" They know clownfish. But what they don't realize is that clownfish species all start life - any individual that's born starts life as a male. And then later in life, he transitions into a female. ZOMORODI: Really? HARDT: Yeah, yeah. And they pair up - a male and a female will pair up. And for them to make the most babies, what they want is for the bigger of the two to be female. And this is because unlike in mammals where - for example, with humans - right? - a woman is born with all the eggs she will ever have, in fish, the bigger the female is, the more eggs she can carry. And since sperm is really cheap to make, a small male energetically can make a lot of sperm. He can make enough sperm to fertilize all of a large female's eggs. (SOUNDBITE OF DEEP SEA WATER) HARDT: And what's happening is the female is actually sort of doing this psychological warfare, and she kind of bullies her mate, the male. And she kind of keeps him from sort of getting too aggressive where he would actually then begin to transition into a female. He then bullies all these smaller males to say don't you guys get any wrong ideas about competing with me for access to this female's eggs. So his bullying kind of keeps the juveniles in this almost, like, suspended premature state. And then when that female dies, the male can very quickly transition into a female. And then the next largest juvenile matures into a male. And then they will become the mating couple. And nobody has to leave the anemone and go find a date or a mate, which is much safer. ZOMORODI: That is crazy. HARDT: It's crazy (laughter). (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ZOMORODI: Who knew that clownfish could be so intriguing? HARDT: You just can't make this stuff up. You know, nature has the best imagination of all. ZOMORODI: But the fact that you and I and most people know very little about how clownfish mate and very rarely think about how marine life reproduce, Marah says that's a problem. HARDT: Because these animals reproduce in a different way, our actions affect the success of sex in the sea in ways that we might not anticipate right when it's most important. ZOMORODI: So for clownfish - they're often caught and sold as aquarium pets. HARDT: And the bigger fish - right? - are the ones that tend to be the more attractive for sale. So if you imagine on a reef, you go around and you start pulling off all the big clownfish, you're taking all the females. ZOMORODI: And taking all the females completely disrupts the life cycle of an entire school of clownfish. HARDT: You skew the sex ratio. You're making it harder for those individuals that are left behind to actually find their mates, or you're forcing them to transition in a - under conditions sooner than they would. And that's it's going to actually decrease the amount of offspring that is being produced. ZOMORODI: Which causes a ripple effect for every creature connected to the clownfish. So just imagine how we are messing with the mating habits of all kinds of marine life, the ones we know about and the ones we don't. HARDT: It's so varied, the way that animals have sex in the sea. And it's so different that we really need to take that step back and start to shift the way that we act and shift some of our behaviors so that we can respect the way that life reproduces there rather than thwarting them. (SOUNDBITE OF WAVES CRASHING) ZOMORODI: All to say, we need to know how marine life do it. And so now let's dive deeper and move from the coral reefs of the South Pacific down to the cold, cold romantic waters off the coast of Maine. (SOUNDBITE OF TEDx TALK) HARDT: Take Maine lobster. They don't look that romantic or that kinky. They are both. ZOMORODI: Here's Marah Hardt on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TEDx TALK) HARDT: During mating season, female lobsters want to mate with the biggest, baddest males. But these guys are really aggressive, and they'll attack any lobster that approaches, male or female. Meanwhile, the best time for her to mate with a male is right after she's molted, when she's lost her hard shell. So she has to approach this aggressive guy in her most vulnerable state. What's a girl to do? (LAUGHTER) HARDT: Her answer - spray him in the face repeatedly with her urine. (LAUGHTER) HARDT: Mmm hmm. Under the sea, pee is a very powerful love potion. (LAUGHTER) HARDT: Conveniently, lobsters' bladders sit just above their brains, and they have two nozzles under their eyestalk with which they can shoot their urine forward. So the female approaches the male's den. And as he charges out, she lets loose a stream of urine and then gets the hell out of there. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) HARDT: Only a few days of this daily dosing is all it takes for her scent to have a transformative effect. The male turns from an aggressive to a gentle lover. By the week's end, he invites her into his den. ZOMORODI: OK. So urine as an aphrodisiac, also kind of a chill pill - so he invites her in for a nightcap. Is that kind of it? They go for it? HARDT: So she will occupy the den with him, and they'll hang out for a while - a couple of days. They'll hunt. They'll feed. They'll sleep, do their. . . ZOMORODI: Wow. HARDT: . . . Lobster stuff. And then when she feels that her molt is imminent, she will circle around front of him. And then they go through this wonderful ritual. He sort of bows his head down and puts his big claws out in the sand, and she sort of rises herself up. And she takes one of her big claws, and she'll tap him on one shoulder and then the other. ZOMORODI: What? HARDT: And we call this - yeah. We call this knighting 'cause it really looks like that. And we. . . ZOMORODI: You are chosen. HARDT: You are chosen. And we're pretty sure it means, not only are - you are chosen, but don't go anywhere 'cause all of this is about to happen. ZOMORODI: Oh. HARDT: She then goes to the back of the den. And for the next few hours, she will molt. So she sort of slips out of her shell if you will. That whole time, the male guards over her. He'll walk back and forth from the front of the den to her. He'll sort of stroke her with his antenna and his walking legs, his small legs. And lobsters - their taste buds are on their feet, on their - those little legs. So he's actually kind of like tasting her, licking her. That's where, like, the kinky part comes in. So he's sort of guarding over her, tasting her, caring for her. And then she sort of gives him a signal that she's ready. And now, at this point, she literally is like a blob. She can't support her own weight. She cannot stand up. She can't really move. And so he scoops her up using his walking legs and forms almost like a hammock and holds her and rolls her over so that they're belly to belly - basically in the missionary position - and sort of cradles her there. And then he inserts these two special little fins that he has sort of at the base of his tail that slot into that pouch, and he delivers his sperm packet. And then he very gently lays her back down, and that's it. That's the sex. But then for the next few days, he will guard the front of that den while her new shell is hardening. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) HARDT: And then when she's ready, she stands up, says thank you very much, leaves the den. They probably never see each other again. And then the next female will arrive at his doorstep and start spraying him in the face with her pee, and the whole thing repeats. ZOMORODI: It's like marine erotica kind of. Like, it's. . . HARDT: So, right. You go down a lot of rabbit holes when you're. . . ZOMORODI: Yes. HARDT: . . . Writing a book about sex in the sea. And I would never want anyone to look at the history of my computer. I'd be terrified at what they'd find. (LAUGHTER) ZOMORODI: So in terms of the role that humans are playing in lobster sex - I mean, in terms of I guess I should say disrupting lobster sex, like, can you explain that? HARDT: Sure.

Except for his testes. His testes, actually, like, kick up into, like, full-blown maturity mode. And he starts producing sperm.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ZOMORODI: I'm Manoush Zomorodi, and today, we are spending our time together under the sea. CATHERINE MOHR: The magic that is under the water, we've only really just begun to explore. ZOMORODI: This is Catherine Mohr, and over the years, she's worn lots of different hats. MOHR: I'm an engineer turned surgeon turned global health care strategist. ZOMORODI: Beyond her professional world, Catherine loves adventure, especially in the ocean. MOHR: I have been a scuba diver ever since I was in college, and I enjoy exploring new things, which occasionally puts you in danger's way. ZOMORODI: So that brings us to January, 1997, the start of what turned out to be a love story, though it really doesn't seem that way at first. MOHR: I had a group of friends who all wanted to get together and go scuba diving and land-exploring in the Galapagos. And it's an area where there's enormous pelagic life, whales and sharks and manta rays, and it's diving like nowhere else. ZOMORODI: So Catherine and her friends chartered a boat to some of the most remote Galapagos Islands. MOHR: It was a sunny day, and we were pretty sure we were going to see a lot of hammerhead sharks. And they will congregate in very large schools. So you get in the water, and you just calmly sink down to the bottom. And now you're under the schools, and you can look up and see them all. ZOMORODI: Wow. You weren't scared at all? MOHR: I had been diving with enough sharks at that point that it was excitement rather than fear. You know, sharks get a really bad rap. We're not their food. They're not going to come and just sort of randomly taste us. So, you know, my heart rate was fast, but that was excitement. I was on the hunt for the beautiful photograph. ZOMORODI: So Catherine was there, 50 feet down beneath a school of sharks, and the surge, the back-and-forth movement of the water, was particularly bad that day. MOHR: Yes. And so the bottom wasn't smooth and sandy. It had some fairly large rocks and a lot of sea life, like sea urchins and things like that, around on the rocks, so that's where I was. And then I got caught in a particularly big surge, and I instinctively flung my right hand out - 'cause I had my camera rig tucked in my left arm - to brace myself against the rock. But I wasn't bracing myself against a rock. I slammed my hand into one of those sea urchins. And I felt the crunch kind of travel up my arm, and I pulled my hand back, and I could see that there were sea urchin spines stuck all the way through my hand. ZOMORODI: So you were stabbed essentially under water. MOHR: Yes. ZOMORODI: What went through your head? MOHR: It was absolute disbelief. I mean, I'm looking at these things through my glove. You know, I'm not actually looking straight at the skin of my hand, and so it was surreal. It didn't feel like that was possible. It felt like it wasn't my hand. ZOMORODI: Catherine Mohr continues her story from the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)MOHR: Now, this is bad. I mean, obviously, when you have something all the way through your hand, it's kind of bad anyway, but in this case, sea urchins have a venom on them that - if you've ever tangled with them, you know that a sea urchin spine in you gives you horrible, painful inflammation. So adrenaline brain kicked in, and I just yanked the spines out. I don't remember doing it. I just remember thinking, I can't get my glove off with these in here. I do remember taking the glove off and a big plume of black coming up in front of my face. And biologist brain now shows up and starts freaking out. How could all that toxin have gotten into that wound already? Well, physicist brain then shows up and very calmly explains, no, no, no, we're at 50 feet. Red wavelengths are attenuated. That's blood, not black - and sharks. So what are you going to do? So I'm in this cloud of blood, and I really, at an intellectual level, knew that I probably was not in much danger. You know, you think blood in the water, and suddenly it's a feeding frenzy. But no, hammerhead sharks don't really feed when they're schooling like that. But I didn't really want to be in the cloud of blood, and I didn't really want to go up through the set of sharks while I was really actively bleeding. So I used this band that you have on your scuba diving rig, and I slipped my hand up underneath it, and I cranked that cummerbund down really hard over my hand to kind of put pressure and then sort of angled off towards where my buddy was so to leave that cloud of blood behind. ZOMORODI: But so eventually you have to surface, right? MOHR: Yes, yes, you're out of air. The dive is done. ZOMORODI: So how did you do it? MOHR: So I looked for a not very sharky area, but there weren't any very not sharky areas 'cause we were in this big upwelling in this big school. And yeah, leaving down close to the bottom and swimming up through them and being in free water felt a whole lot more exposed, and the temptation to go super fast is. . . ZOMORODI: Yeah, yeah. MOHR: . . . Really high but you can't. So I just chanted, they don't feed when they're schooling. They don't feed when they're schooling. They don't feed when they're schooling - all the way up. ZOMORODI: Your adrenaline must have been through the roof. So you get pulled into the boat, and you're like, hey, so this thing happened when I was down there. I mean, is there venom in your hand at this point? MOHR: Well, yeah, there's sort of a slime that's on the outside of the spines. And there were a lot of local ways in which people dealt with getting sea urchin spine stabs because they can get infected, and they can get really quite terrible reactions to them. And we were a good two days away from where I could get any sort of formal medical attention. ZOMORODI: Oh, wow. MOHR: And so the guys who were our local guides were, like, super apologetic, but they said, you know, you've got to get that as hot as you can, and if you can do that, you know, we can minimize the possibility that you'll get an infection or a really bad reaction. So I put my hand in water as hot as I could stand, and I let it acclimatize a little bit. And so once it got to the equalization point, they started pouring additional boiling water into. . . ZOMORODI: Oh, my God. MOHR: . . . The pot where my hand was. And so they would bring the temperature up a little bit, and, you know, it would really hurt, and it would acclimatize, and then they'd put more hot water in. And they were just essentially going to go until I freaked out and took my hand out because the more they could do that, the more likely I was to not have any bad effects. ZOMORODI: Did you - I mean, did it turn you against the ocean in any way? Were you like, this is crazy? This is too dangerous. Were you angry? Like. . . MOHR: No. ZOMORODI: No? None of - nothing like that? MOHR: No, not at all. No, no, I mean, the ocean doesn't care about you, but it also means the ocean isn't malicious. The ocean didn't do that to me. I wasn't going to feel resentful. I was a guest, and I got hurt, but it wasn't the ocean's fault. That was my fault. No, I went diving the next day. ZOMORODI: What? MOHR: You couldn't keep me out of the water. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ZOMORODI: Oceans cover almost three-quarters of the Earth's surface. More than 80% of that underwater world remains largely unexplored. And while those depths can seem vast and frightening, they're also a place of magic, whimsy, passion and even love. So today on the show, a love letter to the sea. We'll dive under the waves to explore connection and intimacy from the surprising sex lives of fish to villainous snails that will enamor you and a love story, which brings us to the conclusion of Catherine Mohr's run-in with that sea urchin. A few weeks later, her hand was starting to heal - all except for one spot which stayed stiff and painful. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)MOHR: So it turned out, I'd broken off a tip of the urchin spine in the joint itself, and that's why it wasn't getting better. And so the orthopedist says, you know, we should get this out. Nothing too urgent, not emergency, so we scheduled a small surgery for a few weeks out on a Monday, and on the Friday before, I broke my pelvis in a horseback riding accident. Yeah. So we kind of postponed that surgery. My broken pelvis and I were now facing six weeks on the couch, and I would have gone absolutely insane if it hadn't been for my friends. Spontaneous parties broke out at my house every night for weeks. I was fed. I was entertained. It was great. But that kind of enthusiasm is sort of hard to sustain over the long term. And eventually it petered down to just one friend who would send me jokes during the day and come and keep me company in the evenings, someone I got to know a lot better during this period of convalescence. He and I had been friends for about 3 1/2 years at that point and hadn't really ever thought about a romantic relationship. But he was one of the most stalwart people. And our conversations broadened and deepened, and so I developed the most important relationship of my life while I was convalescing on that bed. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)MOHR: That was 21 years ago, and for 19 of those years, I have been married to that marvelous introvert who never in a million years would have approached me under other circumstances. So this isn't a story about piercings or sharks or boilings or breakings. It's a love story. It's a love story with a funny little epilogue. Now I was weight-bearing again, I could reschedule that surgery, get the spine out. But I didn't need it anymore. Turns out when you break a bone, your body scavenges calcium from all the bones in your body and from the little sea urchin spine that you happen to have lodged in the joint of your finger. So yes, my pelvis is now part sea urchin. So you don't need to worry though. That I am not fully human is one of the things that my family loves the most about me. Thank you very much. ZOMORODI: That's Catherine Mohr. You can go to ted. npr. org to see her full talk, along with beautiful illustrations by artist Natalie Mohr, who also happens to be her daughter. On the show today, A Love Letter To The Ocean. I'm Manoush Zomorodi, and you're listening to the TED Radio Hour from NPR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) MANOUSH ZOMORODI, HOST:   It's the TED Radio Hour from NPR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ZOMORODI: I'm Manoush Zomorodi, and today, we are spending our time together under the sea. CATHERINE MOHR: The magic that is under the water, we've only really just begun to explore. ZOMORODI: This is Catherine Mohr, and over the years, she's worn lots of different hats. MOHR: I'm an engineer turned surgeon turned global health care strategist. ZOMORODI: Beyond her professional world, Catherine loves adventure, especially in the ocean. MOHR: I have been a scuba diver ever since I was in college, and I enjoy exploring new things, which occasionally puts you in danger's way. ZOMORODI: So that brings us to January, 1997, the start of what turned out to be a love story, though it really doesn't seem that way at first. MOHR: I had a group of friends who all wanted to get together and go scuba diving and land-exploring in the Galapagos. And it's an area where there's enormous pelagic life, whales and sharks and manta rays, and it's diving like nowhere else. ZOMORODI: So Catherine and her friends chartered a boat to some of the most remote Galapagos Islands. MOHR: It was a sunny day, and we were pretty sure we were going to see a lot of hammerhead sharks. And they will congregate in very large schools. So you get in the water, and you just calmly sink down to the bottom. And now you're under the schools, and you can look up and see them all. ZOMORODI: Wow. You weren't scared at all? MOHR: I had been diving with enough sharks at that point that it was excitement rather than fear. You know, sharks get a really bad rap. We're not their food. They're not going to come and just sort of randomly taste us. So, you know, my heart rate was fast, but that was excitement. I was on the hunt for the beautiful photograph. ZOMORODI: So Catherine was there, 50 feet down beneath a school of sharks, and the surge, the back-and-forth movement of the water, was particularly bad that day. MOHR: Yes. And so the bottom wasn't smooth and sandy. It had some fairly large rocks and a lot of sea life, like sea urchins and things like that, around on the rocks, so that's where I was. And then I got caught in a particularly big surge, and I instinctively flung my right hand out - 'cause I had my camera rig tucked in my left arm - to brace myself against the rock. But I wasn't bracing myself against a rock. I slammed my hand into one of those sea urchins. And I felt the crunch kind of travel up my arm, and I pulled my hand back, and I could see that there were sea urchin spines stuck all the way through my hand. ZOMORODI: So you were stabbed essentially under water. MOHR: Yes. ZOMORODI: What went through your head? MOHR: It was absolute disbelief. I mean, I'm looking at these things through my glove. You know, I'm not actually looking straight at the skin of my hand, and so it was surreal. It didn't feel like that was possible. It felt like it wasn't my hand. ZOMORODI: Catherine Mohr continues her story from the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) MOHR: Now, this is bad. I mean, obviously, when you have something all the way through your hand, it's kind of bad anyway, but in this case, sea urchins have a venom on them that - if you've ever tangled with them, you know that a sea urchin spine in you gives you horrible, painful inflammation. So adrenaline brain kicked in, and I just yanked the spines out. I don't remember doing it. I just remember thinking, I can't get my glove off with these in here. I do remember taking the glove off and a big plume of black coming up in front of my face. And biologist brain now shows up and starts freaking out. How could all that toxin have gotten into that wound already? Well, physicist brain then shows up and very calmly explains, no, no, no, we're at 50 feet. Red wavelengths are attenuated. That's blood, not black - and sharks. So what are you going to do? So I'm in this cloud of blood, and I really, at an intellectual level, knew that I probably was not in much danger. You know, you think blood in the water, and suddenly it's a feeding frenzy. But no, hammerhead sharks don't really feed when they're schooling like that. But I didn't really want to be in the cloud of blood, and I didn't really want to go up through the set of sharks while I was really actively bleeding.

ZOMORODI: But so eventually you have to surface, right? MOHR: Yes, yes, you're out of air. The dive is done. ZOMORODI: So how did you do it? MOHR: So I looked for a not very sharky area, but there weren't any very not sharky areas 'cause we were in this big upwelling in this big school.

What did people really lose by working from home? Did some people gain? Should we all come back? These are especially pressing questions at one workplace, where face-to-face interactions are considered essential to people's best work. NPR's Andrea Hsu takes us there. ANDREA HSU, BYLINE: Vivek Jayaraman remembers the day he came back to his office in Ashburn, Va. VIVEK JAYARAMAN: I got a rush of just walking around the building. I didn't - there weren't even many people in the building at that point. HSU: Jayaraman is a neuroscientist at the Janelia Research Campus. It's part of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. He studies the brains of fruit flies, how those brains help flies navigate their world. JAYARAMAN: I mean, there's a lot going on there. It's just very compressed. It's a miniaturized marvel is what it is. HSU: He's worked here for 15 years, and he's steeped in the ethos of this place, believing that it's not just collaboration but spontaneous creative collisions that lead to great discoveries. JAYARAMAN: This building - it's been socially engineered so that you do have those kinds of collisions. There's, like, one space where there's and coffee. It's deliberate. HSU: That's right. You're not supposed to have a coffee maker in your lab. The idea is you walk the halls. You run into someone you didn't plan to see. You start chatting. An idea gets sparked. You follow up, maybe at night when the coffee station turns into a pub. The pandemic shut all of that down. JAYARAMAN: The spontaneity is just gone. All you have now are these Zoom meetings. HSU: Where there's a set agenda, and everyone has to take turns. Jayaraman says some work did go on, but there were lab experiments that didn't happen. And who knows what ideas didn't get sparked when conversations moved online? JAYARAMAN: There's absolutely something lost in that process. And so I'd say that it's definitely held us back in terms of moving the science forward. HSU: Now, before the pandemic, there'd be maybe 750 people here on any given day. Now it's fewer than half that. And most seem to be tucked away in their offices. You don't see a lot of people wandering the halls. COVID safety protocols are still very much in force. Everyone's wearing masks and keeping their distance, especially in the cafeteria. RON VALE: You know, maybe I'll get that warm eggplant ragout sandwich, please. HSU: That's Ron Vale, the executive director of Janelia, ordering from a safe 8 or 10 feet away. Before the pandemic, he says, lunch was only served from 11:30 to 1. VALE: We wanted people, actually, to have lunch togetherHSU: And by together, he means at big, round tables that seat eight, like at a wedding. VALE: So we were encouraging, like, high-density interactions then, exactly the opposite of what we're doing now. HSU: There is only one chair at each table now, but they have been thinking hard about how to get people face-to-face again. Outside, they put up a tent and created some cozy seating areas. VALE: They're little fire pits with four chairs around them. HSU: And they're doing COVID testing twice a week for those who come on site. Vale says the plan is to bring everyone back to campus full time in late September. By then, they'll also require vaccinations. He does hope to hang on to some of the good things that have come out of the pandemic, for instance, the virtual conferences that were more accessible to scientists from smaller institutions and farther-flung places. They'll keep those going even when in-person conferences resume. VALE: And I think that will be a positive. HSU: Virginia Rutten and points out another positive. She's a graduate research fellow studying zebrafish. This past year, she's been able to ask questions of all kinds of folks who are normally kind of hard to reach. VIRGINIA RUTTEN: You just feel that everybody is a little bit more relaxed, has the time to explain the actual thing to you. And that's been really valuable and a real treat. HSU: And the kind of thing that's worth preserving. Andrea Hsu, NPR News.

S. are already dangerous to human health. Last week it was 105 in Omaha, 118 in Phoenix and 123 in Palm Springs. This will become more common as the Earth heats up, so we're going to talk with Kristina Dahl about how people can protect themselves as another hot summer unfolds. She's a senior climate scientist with the Union of Concerned Scientists. Good to have you here. KRISTINA DAHL: It's great to be here. SHAPIRO: Before we get to practical steps that people should be taking, how unusual are these kinds of temperatures so early in the season? DAHL: It is very unusual to have such intense and such long-lasting heat so early in the season. I mean, typically, we see places reaching these kinds of temperatures at the hottest parts of the summer - you know, late July, August, sometimes even early September. But it is quite unusual to be seeing so many records being broken even before the official start of the summer season. SHAPIRO: Yeah. And every year, we hear of people in the U. S. dying from overexposure to heat. Which groups are most at risk? DAHL: That's right. We often call heat the silent killer. Of all of the types of extreme weather, people die from extreme heat the most. It typically kills more people in a given year than something like hurricanes or droughts. SHAPIRO: Wow. DAHL: So it is extremely important to be taking care of our health when we're experiencing extreme heat. The people who tend to be most at risk are elderly adults. As you become older, your body has more trouble regulating your temperature. And so adults have a harder time shedding the heat that accumulates in their bodies when it's extremely hot outside. We also see high risks to athletes. When we are young and healthy, it's harder to listen to those early signals of heat illness that your body's trying to give you. And so we do, unfortunately, every year see people who are otherwise fit and healthy passing away due to extreme heat exposure. SHAPIRO: Well, let's talk about those specific groups. I mean, for senior citizens, what do you recommend people do to protect themselves or their neighbors or older relatives? DAHL: So it's important, if you're not elderly, to be checking in on your elderly neighbors and relatives, making sure that they have the opportunity to cool off. If you are an elderly adult, being aware of how heat can affect your health is really important. So some of those early symptoms include things like dizziness or headache or feeling extremely tired. And so if you're experiencing those, no matter what your age, make sure that you take some time to lie down and rest. Drink water. And if you can, get to a cool place. SHAPIRO: There are people who have to work outdoors no matter the weather, perhaps in construction or landscaping. Beyond being aware of the symptoms of heatstroke, are there things they can do to help maintain their health even in these extreme temperatures? DAHL: So in those cases, people do need to be aware of what those early symptoms of heat-related illness are. But the onus is also on employers to be providing adequate hydration breaks, rest breaks, shade, cooling, maybe even shifting work hours to earlier, cooler times of the day. So we can't put all of the onus on the workers themselves because often, the work is designed in ways that disincentives taking breaks. SHAPIRO: You said that young and otherwise healthy people sometimes overexert themselves, thinking that they are invincible. So if you are a parent or a coach or a student athlete, what would you suggest those groups look out for? DAHL: When it comes to heat, it's incredibly important not to overexert yourself because when it's really hot out, when it's really humid out, your body has a harder time shedding heat that accumulates within it for a number of reasons. For example, if it's very humid, it becomes harder for the sweat on your skin to evaporate. And it's that evaporation of sweat that really provides the cooling effect to your body. SHAPIRO: I'm just thinking - I live in Washington, D. C. , a notoriously hot and humid city. And I love to go out for a run and sweat it all out and get exhausted. And it sounds like you're saying I am gambling with my health by doing that. Maybe I should reconsider it. DAHL: I would just say pay attention. You know your body, and you know its limits. So it's not that you have to completely cease doing outdoor exercise in the heat, but just pay attention. And if you're starting to feel dizzy, if you're starting to get a headache, if you're starting to really lag, listen to those warning signs that your body is giving you, and take a break. SHAPIRO: Kristina Dahl is a senior climate scientist with the Union of Concerned Scientists. Thanks for helping us launch this summer season. DAHL: Thanks so much.

Manatees are large marine mammals native to Florida, which spend their time grazing on seagrass in shallow coastal areas. NPR's Greg Allen reports that many of the deaths are in Florida's Indian River Lagoon, where a large die-off of seagrass has left manatees without enough to eat. (SOUNDBITE OF BOAT ENGINE STARTING)GREG ALLEN, BYLINE: It's a beautiful day on Indian River Lagoon. Biologist Ryan Brushwood starts the engine on his small flatboat to check on seagrass he's planted in the estuary. The water has a slight greenish tint but is clearer than it was in January when, Brushwood says, there were algae blooms. RYAN BRUSHWOOD: When those blooms were really bad, I mean, you couldn't see your hand below the surface. There was not a lot of light getting down to the plants. ALLEN: Indian River Lagoon isn't actually a river. It's a large estuary bounded by barrier islands on Florida's Atlantic coast. It extends more than 150 miles from Cape Canaveral to Stuart. For years, there have been concerns about declining water quality in the lagoon, caused by a number of factors, including development, septic systems, stormwater runoff and warming temperatures from climate change. In 2011, an algae superbloom covered more than 130,000 acres of the lagoon's water, blocking the sunlight and causing a massive die-off of seagrass. BRUSHWOOD: In hindsight, it probably was the tipping point, and there was (ph) many factors that occurred before that. ALLEN: Manatees love Indian River Lagoon, and for years, it provided them with lush seagrass. That's not the case now. Scientists say there's been a decrease of about 46,000 acres. Indian River Lagoon is a special and fragile place. It's one of the most biodiverse estuaries in the Northern Hemisphere, home to 35 species that are endangered or threatened. Nearly a third of Florida's manatees spend some time in the lagoon each year. But the large die-off of seagrass has left them without enough to eat. Jon Peterson heads rescue operations at SeaWorld. Since December, his crews have been busy responding to the large numbers of sick and dying manatees. JON PETERSON: It's really eye-awakening when you watch what's going on. You have animals that are out there floating high to what you would - in a normal year, you'd think it's a punctured lung, you know, an issue from a boat strike. And what it's turning out to be is it's a starvation event. ALLEN: More than 750 manatees have died this year, the most deaths ever in a five-month period. More than half of them were in Indian River Lagoon. The high number of deaths has the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service concerned, and it's opened an investigation. Peterson says the entire population of manatees in Florida is estimated at no more than 6,800. PETERSON: When you're talking a population like that and you have a loss of 700 in your first quarter of the year, it is a very scary look right now. (SOUNDBITE OF WATER SPLASHING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: All right, guys, careful. ALLEN: Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission crews this spring responded to more than 90 reports of manatees in distress, including orphaned calves. This one was rescued in May and taken to SeaWorld in Orlando. SeaWorld is one of four facilities in Florida that rehabilitate sick and injured manatees. Peterson says his staff is caring for 28 of them. Ten are so weak they're getting nutrition through feeding tubes. Because the manatees have lost so much weight, he says rehabilitation takes longer than usual. PETERSON: You're talking an animal that's down, let's say, 400, 500 pounds. It will take us three to five months to put that weight back up there to get them to a point where we can release them. ALLEN: Manatees don't do well in cold water, which is why they congregate during the winter months in Indian River Lagoon and other Florida coastal areas. Now that it's warming up, scientists say manatees are beginning to disperse to other areas along the Gulf and Atlantic coasts, where they may find ample seagrass. But by late fall, they'll return again in large numbers to familiar waters, including the lagoon. Michael Walsh, an associate professor at the University of Florida who specializes in aquatic animal health, is worried this mortality event may be far from over. MICHAEL WALSH: We have a compromised system that the animals have to utilize and stay in, but the food is just not there at the same amount that it used to be. ALLEN: The key to helping manatees, Walsh and other scientists say, is to get the Indian River Lagoon healthy. That will take years, maybe decades. But there are signs of progress. Florida just allocated a half-billion dollars to phase out septic systems, a key contributor to the region's nutrient pollution. And in the lagoon, the company Ryan Brushwood works for, Sea & Shoreline, is having success restoring seagrass. BRUSHWOOD: You can see there's nine shoots growing off of one single rhizome. It looks pretty healthy. That's kind of the density that we're seeing right now. ALLEN: Working on a grant from the National Estuary Program, Sea & Shoreline planted two acres of a resilient species of seagrass last June. A year later, it's thriving. Similar replanting efforts helped bring back healthy seagrass beds in Crystal River, another manatee habitat in Florida. Brushwood believes that with enough time and funding, a large-scale effort could bring seagrass back here and tip things back in favor of the manatees. Greg Allen, NPR News, Cocoa Beach, Fla.

Top officials say that it is also a campaign for economic and racial equity. NPR's Dan Charles has been looking into what this means in practice. Hi, Dan. Thanks for being here. DAN CHARLES, BYLINE: It's good to be here. KING: OK, so there's this idea now of attacking two things at once - climate change and also social inequity. How do you do that? CHARLES: Well, that is what I wanted to know. And I got some interesting answers, Noel, in Cleveland. KING: Why Cleveland? CHARLES: Well, a couple of reasons. First, it is one of the poorest cities in America. It is also one of the cities that's created what it calls a climate action plan. And a few years ago, officials in Cleveland decided to rewrite that plan with equity in mind. KING: Which sounds like what the Biden administration is promising. CHARLES: Cleveland was kind of writing the blueprint for this. And they started with conversations in low-income neighborhoods and Black neighborhoods, which is kind of new. Kimberly Foreman, who's executive director of a group in Cleveland called Environmental Health Watch, says the debate about environmental policy, climate policy has often been disconnected from those communities. KIMBERLY FOREMAN: It was a little elitist - right? - or heavily focused on technology, which is not getting down to the grassroots or getting down to the people who are most impacted. CHARLES: The city set up a bunch of community meetings asking people, what are you concerned about in your neighborhoods? KING: And I would imagine that some of the things that people are concerned about have absolutely nothing to do with climate change. CHARLES: Yes, at first glance at least. So, for instance, they went to a neighborhood called Hough, and one of the people who showed up was Cindy Mumford. CINDY MUMFORD: And when I went to the meeting, they really gave you a voice. It wasn't one of those just sit down things where you just listen to someone present. KING: What was Miss Mumford concerned about in her neighborhood? CHARLES: Well, to explain that, she took me on a little walking tour, in the rain, she and her neighbor across the street, Deborah Lewis, who grew up in Hough. DEBORAH LEWIS: It is a community that was devastated by what I can only call tenement housing. CHARLES: We were walking down this street that a century ago was lined by stately Victorians, also four- or five-story brick apartment buildings. That's what became the tenement housing. And one clue for how this happened is a map that a federally backed home loan agency put out in 1940. It showed this neighborhood colored red, meaning it was risky to lend money here. And as part of its explanation, the agency wrote that Black people were moving in. Buildings emptied out, residents moved to the suburbs. Mumford and Lewis say some property owners just stopped maintaining their buildings,MUMFORD: left the buildings abandoned for years. Years, we were plagued with these eyesores. LEWIS: To the point where that housing had to be taken down, some lovely old buildings. I mean, my gosh, they just don't build them that way anymore. But you have to take care of them. CHARLES: Those lots are covered with grass now. Some of the old buildings that remain look like they're in bad shape. So what Mumford and Lewis want for their neighborhood is rebuilding, reinvestment. And at that climate meeting, they got excited about the idea of community solar. It's an installation of solar panels. This would be on a vacant lot big enough to power their homes and those of 50 or so neighbors. They've lined up backers for this. It might really happen. Lewis says it would be clean energy, also economic development, jobs, especially during construction, ownership of a valuable asset. LEWIS: The inner city is keenly interested in tomorrow. We're not just interested in being a consumer. We're interested in moving into the future. CHARLES: At those community meetings, other people talked about children suffering from asthma, big utility bills, wanting more trees and green spaces, better bus service. And Matt Gray, who was Cleveland's chief of sustainability at the time, says the connection to climate was natural. Renovated houses are healthier places to live, and also with better heating equipment, people aren't burning so much gas. Public transit and walkable streets means less fuel consumed in cars. Trees keep everything cooler in summer. MATT GRAY: That's what we're realizing, right? That's what climate justice, climate equity is all about. We can take climate action, and we can make more equitable, healthy communities. CHARLES: Now, Cleveland does not have the money to do this on a big scale. The city has actually just done modest pilot projects. But Gray thinks discussions like this in Cleveland and in other cities actually paved the way for what the Biden administration now wants to do, which is pour hundreds of billions of dollars into housing renovation and transit and clean energy. KING: Yes, this is sounding familiar. Climate justice, in a sense, means infrastructure. CHARLES: That is what Cecilia Martinez. She's a senior official at the White House Council on Environmental Quality. CECILIA MARTINEZ: The Environmental Justice Community and many of our Black and brown communities have identified the connection between climate change and their own community infrastructure. They can't be disconnected. CHARLES: Now, this money may never arrive. Republicans in Congress don't include most of the spending in their counterproposal on infrastructure. The Biden administration could cut it in order to get some kind of infrastructure bill through Congress. But local officials in Cleveland are certainly hoping it comes through. One of them told me we have spent much of the past decade preparing for this moment. KING: Interesting stuff. NPR's Dan Charles. Thank you, Dan. CHARLES: Thank you.

LEWIS: To the point where that housing had to be taken down, some lovely old buildings. I mean, my gosh, they just don't build them that way anymore. But you have to take care of them. CHARLES: Those lots are covered with grass now. Some of the old buildings that remain look like they're in bad shape. So what Mumford and Lewis want for their neighborhood is rebuilding, reinvestment. And at that climate meeting, they got excited about the idea of community solar. It's an installation of solar panels. This would be on a vacant lot big enough to power their homes and those of 50 or so neighbors. They've lined up backers for this. It might really happen. Lewis says it would be clean energy, also economic development, jobs, especially during construction, ownership of a valuable asset. LEWIS: The inner city is keenly interested in tomorrow. We're not just interested in being a consumer. We're interested in moving into the future. CHARLES: At those community meetings, other people talked about children suffering from asthma, big utility bills, wanting more trees and green spaces, better bus service. And Matt Gray, who was Cleveland's chief of sustainability at the time, says the connection to climate was natural. Renovated houses are healthier places to live, and also with better heating equipment, people aren't burning so much gas. Public transit and walkable streets means less fuel consumed in cars. Trees keep everything cooler in summer. MATT GRAY: That's what we're realizing, right? That's what climate justice, climate equity is all about. We can take climate action, and we can make more equitable, healthy communities. CHARLES: Now, Cleveland does not have the money to do this on a big scale. The city has actually just done modest pilot projects. But Gray thinks discussions like this in Cleveland and in other cities actually paved the way for what the Biden administration now wants to do, which is pour hundreds of billions of dollars into housing renovation and transit and clean energy. KING: Yes, this is sounding familiar. Climate justice, in a sense, means infrastructure. CHARLES: That is what Cecilia Martinez. She's a senior official at the White House Council on Environmental Quality. CECILIA MARTINEZ: The Environmental Justice Community and many of our Black and brown communities have identified the connection between climate change and their own community infrastructure. They can't be disconnected. CHARLES: Now, this money may never arrive. Republicans in Congress don't include most of the spending in their counterproposal on infrastructure. The Biden administration could cut it in order to get some kind of infrastructure bill through Congress. But local officials in Cleveland are certainly hoping it comes through. One of them told me we have spent much of the past decade preparing for this moment. KING: Interesting stuff. NPR's Dan Charles. Thank you, Dan.

S. will not meet President Biden's goal of 70% of U. S. adults getting at least their first COVID-19 vaccine dose by July 4. In fact, it's going to take an extra couple of weeks to get there. And we're joined now by NPR White House correspondent Tamara Keith. And Tamara, let's just start with the data. How close is the country to meeting this goal? How worried is the White House about all this? TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: Well, moving at the current pace, an NPR analysis finds that the U. S. should get to about 67% of adults with at least one shot by July 4. But rather than admit that in a straightforward way, the White House is doing some mathematical gymnastics today. Here's COVID coordinator Jeff Zients on a briefing call with reporters. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JEFF ZIENTS: So as to our goal of 70% for all adults, we're going to hit it for adults 27 and older. This is amazing progress and has our country returning to normal much sooner than anyone could've predicted. KEITH: White House officials have taken to calling that goal aspirational, even arguing that the 70% number was sort of arbitrary, like Jen Psaki, the press secretary, argued today in the briefing room. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JEN PSAKI: There was nothing ever magical through science about 70%. Seventy percent was a bold, ambitious goal we set to continue to drive to get more people vaccinated across the country. KEITH: The White House has from the start set goals that they could - where they could under promise and over deliver. But in this case, the pace of vaccinations just really slowed down after that initial rush of people who were eager to get vaccinated. Dr. Anthony Fauci, who advises the White House, said that when the goal was set, it was seen as achievable. And ultimately, it will be achieved, just not by that deadline that the White House itself had set. But as White House officials have emphasized, it was about more than just a number. It was about America being a place where people could return to normal and their pre-pandemic lives. And cases are down. Deaths are down. Baseball stadiums are full. You know, by the metric of life returning to normal, America is largely there. CORNISH: So for some context, what are. . . KEITH: Yeah. CORNISH: . . . Some of the reasons why they missed this 70% target? KEITH: It's a demand issue. At this point, vaccines are readily available everywhere, but many people are still choosing not to get vaccinated. Some people fear the vaccine more than they fear the virus. The administration says this is particularly a challenge among 18- to 26-year-olds who just aren't as afraid of COVID and are therefore less motivated to get the vaccine. CDC Director Rochelle Walensky says that vaccines are now available for everyone 12 and up. They have been proven to be wildly effective at preventing severe disease and death. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)ROCHELLE WALENSKY: Nearly every death due to COVID-19 is particularly tragic because nearly every death, especially among adults, due to COVID-19 is, at this point, entirely preventable. KEITH: There's also a significant disparity among states in the Northeast. They have, you know, blown past the goal. And in several southern states and a couple of western ones, vaccine rates are still quite low, around 50% or less. CORNISH: What does it mean in the areas of the country where there are these low vaccination rates? KEITH: Well, it means that there are pockets of risk, pockets where there could be virus surges, especially with this new Delta variant, which is rapidly taking hold. It's much more contagious and, potentially, more dangerous. But Dr. Fauci says he doesn't think the U. S. is going to get to a place like we were before, where there were a thousand people a day dying. He says we're unlikely to see another frightening peak like we did in January, but there could be locally significant outbreaks. CORNISH: That's NPR's White House correspondent Tamara Keith.

Urban trees aren't shared equally. In many cities, they're way more common in wealthier neighborhoods. So some cities have adopted a new cause - tree equity. NPR's Dan Charles has the story. DAN CHARLES, BYLINE: On the corner of East 123rd Street and Imperial Avenue in Cleveland, there's a community garden with freshly planted raspberries and a little apple tree and Shirley Bell-Wheeler watching over it. Well, this is lovely. SHIRLEY BELL-WHEELER: Thank you. I'm happy you like it. Nothing is bloomed or pretty-looking yet. But. . . CHARLES: There's an asparagus patch over here. BELL-WHEELER: Those are purple asparagus (laughter). CHARLES: Yeah. BELL-WHEELER: We were really excited about those. CHARLES: Bell-Wheeler's a part-time gardener. She's a teacher's aide at a local school. Green spaces like this, the garden and the parks - they bring healing, she says. BELL-WHEELER: We're dealing with the basic needs of what's best for our bodies physically and also changing the mood or the morale of what's going on in this neighborhood emotionally. We have had a lot of tragedies on this street in particular. CHARLES: About 15 years ago, a serial murderer haunted this neighborhood. He left the bodies of his victims in a house on the next block. BELL-WHEELER: It's very heavy. And it's very - I don't want to say political. It makes you think about social activism because of the fact that if this would have happened in a different neighborhood, it wouldn't have been so many women killed because somebody would have cared more. CHARLES: 90% of the people here are Black. They're mostly low-income. The abandoned houses that used to line that block have been cleared away. The land's being turned into a memorial park. A line of 11 young trees curves through green grass. Bell-Wheeler says the beauty makes her feel better. BELL-WHEELER: It was like we matter. Somebody cares about us. It's a statement of value. CHARLES: She says this neighborhood, Mount Pleasant, should have more parks and trees. BELL-WHEELER: It makes you feel like you're in a better place. Like, everybody wants to be at the park. Who doesn't like being at a park and breathe fresh air? CHARLES: A mile east of here lies the town of Shaker Heights, wealthier than Mount Pleasant, with more white people and full of towering, leafy trees. Jacquie Gillon, who works with an environmental group in Cleveland called the Western Reserve Land Conservancy, says that contrast raises a question. JACQUIE GILLON: The fact that Shaker maintained its leafiness but Mount Pleasant didn't - what does that say to you? There's no equity. CHARLES: You can see that pattern in many American cities, she says. GILLON: When you hit the Black community, it's not green anymore, or it's not as green. CHARLES: Sandra Albro, who's director of community partnerships at Cleveland's arboretum, Holden Forests and Gardens, says there are historical reasons for this. Decades ago, the city government didn't spend as much on infrastructure, including trees, in neighborhoods where more Black people lived. SANDRA ALBRO: There was an intentional decision to not plant and maintain tree canopy. CHARLES: And now neighborhoods with less of that canopy get fewer of the benefits that trees can provide - not just beauty, also better health. ALBRO: Stress reduction and, you know, easier environments for our heart and lungs, such as cleaner air and cooler temperatures. CHARLES: That will be increasingly important to deal with heat waves in a warming climate. So Cleveland has adopted trees as part of the city's official plan to deal with climate change and equity at the same time. A coalition of city agencies, nonprofit groups and corporations is pledging to plant hundreds of thousands of new trees. They're still far from accomplishing that, though. And you can't just plant a tree and walk away. Indigo Bishop, a community organizer now working with St. Luke's Foundation, discovered this when she worked with people at one public housing complex. INDIGO BISHOP: I was just blown away by the fact that people were like, tear out the trees. Tear them out. CHARLES: The trees were dropping branches onto cars. The roots were breaking up sidewalks. Bishop says the lesson is, reforesting a city takes planning and continued care. In Cleveland, it's going to take a lot more time and money. There's one giant oak in the city that symbolizes some of Cleveland's historical pain and its hopes. It's tucked away behind a high school in the old Brooklyn neighborhood. Jesse Owens, the track star, planted it. It was one of four saplings he'd received at the 1936 Olympics in Germany - one for each gold medal. But Jeffrey Verespej, executive director of the Old Brooklyn Community Development Corporation, says Owens didn't go to this school or even live nearby. He just trained on its track. JEFFREY VERESPEJ: Old Brooklyn, at that time, was an exclusively white neighborhood and the wealthiest part of the city. So it had the newest school and the fanciest track. So the track star trained in Old Brooklyn, even though he was from the east side of Cleveland. CHARLES: Tree experts at Holden Forests and Gardens cut a bud from this old oak and grew a new tree from it. This spring, they carried the little sapling back to the east side of Cleveland for a ceremonial planting in a park. Tyrone Owens, a distant cousin of the track star, was there to help. TYRONE OWENS: Time passes on. You'd rather not go back and try to figure out what they were trying to do back in those days. You just probably want to go forward. And this is progress right here. CHARLES: They expect to plant three more clones of the Jesse Owens oak in Cleveland. Those trees will spread their limbs in all parts of the city. Dan Charles, NPR News.

Of course, they're not. They're moving. We're moving. Everything's moving in different directions constantly. Suppose there was somebody out there looking back for us. Scientists have now checked to see which nearby stars have the right vantage point to spot Earth. Here's NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE, BYLINE: So far, astronomers have discovered over 4,000 planets outside our solar system. And here's how almost all of them have been found. Researchers watch stars and look for a telltale dimming that occurs when a planet passes in front of a star and blocks some of its light. An alien planet hunter with the right view of our sun could do exactly the same thing to detect Earth. LISA KALTENEGGER: For whom would we be the aliens? Who would see the Earth block light from the sun? GREENFIELDBOYCE: Lisa Kaltenegger is director of the Carl Sagan Institute at Cornell University. KALTENEGGER: I wanted to know who can see us now, but also who could have seen us in the past and who will see us in the future. And how long do you keep this special vantage point? GREENFIELDBOYCE: She teamed up with Jackie Faherty, an astrophysicist at the American Museum of Natural History. They combed through a new catalog of nearby stars and their movements. In the journal Nature, they say, in the last 5,000 years, an abundance of stars have been in a position to see Earth - to be precise, 1,715 stars. These stars should be home to lots of planets. One star, called Ross 128, is already known to be orbited by an Earth-sized planet. Kaltenegger says, if there was life there searching for others. . . KALTENEGGER: Then they could have seen the Earth's transit about 3,000 years ago, but only until 900 years ago. So would they have figured out that there's intelligent life on the Earth? GREENFIELDBOYCE: Maybe not. After all, it's only been in the last hundred years or so that humans have been broadcasting radio and television. So the researchers looked at a smaller set of stars close enough to have already been bathed in our radio waves. Take one named Teegarden Star. It's a dozen light-years away. It's orbited by two small planets that might have temperatures cozy enough for life. They couldn't spot Earth now, but that will soon change as their star moves. KALTENEGGER: In 29 years, they would be able to see us. GREENFIELDBOYCE: And then there's the TRAPPIST-1 system. It's known to have small, rocky planets. It will start being able to find Earth in about 1,600 years. Jackie Faherty says doing this project made her feel strangely vulnerableJACKIE FAHERTY: Because I started to think how easy we are to detect. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Still, no one knows if anyone is even out there to do any detecting. For over half a century, scientists have been searching for messages sent to us by alien life. Jill Tarter is with the SETI Institute. She says this task is hard. JILL TARTER: And we've been discussing, you know, for decades and decades what magic frequencies, what magic times, what magic places. GREENFIELDBOYCE: She thinks this new list of stars that could see us could be helpful and points out that if the amount of space that needed to be searched for extraterrestrial broadcasts was equivalent to all the Earth's oceans, we've only searched about as much as one hot tub full of water.

GREENFIELDBOYCE: Maybe not. After all, it's only been in the last hundred years or so that humans have been broadcasting radio and television. So the researchers looked at a smaller set of stars close enough to have already been bathed in our radio waves. Take one named Teegarden Star. It's a dozen light-years away. It's orbited by two small planets that might have temperatures cozy enough for life. They couldn't spot Earth now, but that will soon change as their star moves. KALTENEGGER: In 29 years, they would be able to see us. GREENFIELDBOYCE: And then there's the TRAPPIST-1 system. It's known to have small, rocky planets. It will start being able to find Earth in about 1,600 years. Jackie Faherty says doing this project made her feel strangely vulnerable JACKIE FAHERTY: Because I started to think how easy we are to detect. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Still, no one knows if anyone is even out there to do any detecting. For over half a century, scientists have been searching for messages sent to us by alien life. Jill Tarter is with the SETI Institute. She says this task is hard. JILL TARTER: And we've been discussing, you know, for decades and decades what magic frequencies, what magic times, what magic places. GREENFIELDBOYCE: She thinks this new list of stars that could see us could be helpful and points out that if the amount of space that needed to be searched for extraterrestrial broadcasts was equivalent to all the Earth's oceans, we've only searched about as much as one hot tub full of water.

But those finds raised a question - did dinosaurs live in the Arctic and Antarctic year round or simply wander their seasonally in search of plants or other dinosaurs to eat? AILSA CHANG, HOST:  A study out today in the journal Current Biology advances that debate. It suggests that dinos lived all year in what is now northern Alaska, enduring freezing winters, snow and months of darkness. GREGORY ERICKSON: Basically, these - you know, these animals were living at the - at an extreme we didn't think that they could live that. CORNISH: Gregory Erickson of Florida State University was on the research team. A key piece of evidence behind his team's claim is a new collection of bones and teeth from tiny baby dinos from more than 70 million years ago. ERICKSON: I mean, frankly, we were stunned when we found all these different types of dinosaurs. It - you know, it (laughter) - it was like it was a prehistoric maternity ward up there. CHANG: Up there is northern Alaska, near the Arctic Coast. The team traveled four days by car, plane and boat to get there. Even then, some of the excavation sites were only accessible by rappelling off a cliff. CORNISH: After scraping through the sediment with dental tools, they found the remains of a baby tyrannosaurus, duckbilled dinos, triceratops relatives and more. CHANG: And given the long incubation times of dinosaur eggs - three to six months for some species they identified - the scientists say these dinosaurs must have been year-round residents. MICHAEL D'EMIC: And so there really wasn't enough time to both lay the eggs, incubate, hatch and then make that seasonal migration. CORNISH: Michael D'Emic of Adelphi University wasn't involved in the work, but he does study dinos. In fact, we caught him. . . D'EMIC: In Wyoming, digging up dinosaurs. CORNISH: What impressed him was not just the find itself, but how tedious the work was. D'EMIC: They found over a hundred bones and teeth that could fit on the head of a pin. And then they laboriously picked through it under the microscope for hundreds of hours, if not thousands. CHANG: He says the work also supports the theory that some dinosaurs could regulate their blood temperature, like we can. D'EMIC: I wouldn't go so far as to say all, but I would say it's safe to say that the majority of dinosaur groups were more warm-blooded than cold. CHANG: Some of these dinosaurs may have also hibernated underground. Here's Erickson again. ERICKSON: I can't imagine any of these small animals enduring the cold if they didn't dig burrows and that sort of thing. But what about the giant ones? What about the giant tyrannosaur we have up there? What were they doing? CORNISH: Now, this study may not answer that question, but Erickson says it does prove you can learn a lot about the biggest animals ever to walk the planet by looking under a microscope.

I'm Manoush Zomorodi. And we want to end our series on the ocean with a look back at how much our understanding about oceans has changed over the last century through the eyes of a legend. SYLVIA EARLE: As a 3-year-old, I got knocked over by a wave. (SOUNDBITE OF WAVES CRASHING)EARLE: And life in the ocean has held my attention ever since. ZOMORODI: This is oceanographer Sylvia Earle. EARLE: I'm a National Geographic explorer and founder of Mission Blue. ZOMORODI: Now, Dr. Earle, can I call you Sylvia? Or should I call you Your Deepness, as you have been referred to over the years? (LAUGHTER)EARLE: You can call me whatever you like. I've been called a lot of things over the years (laughter). (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ZOMORODI: Sylvia is 85 years old now. And what we've learned over the past six decades or so about our oceans is in part thanks to her. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)FRED ROGERS: I remember a day when I was able to go in the ocean with someone who knows as much as anybody in the world about what's underwater in our world. Her name is Sylvia Earle. ZOMORODI: As a scholar, she went on scientific expeditions all over the globe. She was usually the only woman onboard a team documenting sea life, some of which is now extinct. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: . . . The biological program began by converting the former presidential yacht Williamsburg. . . ZOMORODI: In the '60s, space travel was all the rage. But Sylvia got people excited about exploring the mysteries of the deepest oceans. And in the 1970s, she lived in an underwater lab, studying coral reefs. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: Now a team of divers will attempt to live for two weeks. . . ZOMORODI: . . . While leading an all-female team - shocking, I know. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: Ironically, these aquanauts are not men but five young and attractive women, the world's first real-life mermaids. ZOMORODI: Then, in 1979. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: There is a new tool in the sea. ZOMORODI: . . . Sylvia helped design and test a special pressurized underwater suit. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: If successful, she will be the first woman to walk the sea floor beyond 1,000 feet. ZOMORODI: She set that record, then later led NOAA, the government agency tasked with protecting the ocean. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #5: In 1990, Sylvia Earle received a presidential appointment that, for her, was the culmination of a life's work. ZOMORODI: Sylvia received numerous titles and honorary degrees, including the million-dollar TED Prize in 2009. In short, Sylvia Earle is a pioneer who has no plans to stop advocating on behalf of the ocean or stop exploring. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)EARLE: I'm still breathing. I'm still diving. Come on. ZOMORODI: Are you still going in submarines? EARLE: Why not? I mean, it's like getting into a car, for heaven's sakes. It's just. . . (LAUGHTER)ZOMORODI: All right. So, Sylvia, tell me about how you first got so curious about the ocean and marine life. You grew up in Florida, right? And you spent a lot of time exploring the beach. EARLE: For me, it was an adventure every day after school to be able to get out and wade in these seagrasses and see sea urchins, to find little seahorses about half the length of my little finger. They're - pygmy seahorses, they're known as. And I saw creatures like sea hares that used to crawl around in those meadows and scallops. You could walk out and see these blue-eyed scallops just pulsing around. I mean, they, like, are jet-propelled when they close their - the two halves of their shells. (SOUNDBITE OF WAVES CRASHING)EARLE: They would just - such an exciting adventure and, occasionally, to find a little octopus. It was such a joy. ZOMORODI: And it sounds like you let that joy and all the questions that you had about these creatures - you let them kind of propel you academically because you knew you wanted to be a scientist. EARLE: I just kept making choices along the way that would lead me in that direction, all the science classes I could take. But not all the classes had answers. I had to go see for myself and find books that would answer some of the questions. But the books weren't always enough. I asked questions the books couldn't answer. ZOMORODI: (Laughter) Well, so you stuck with it, and you ended up getting your Ph. D. in botany, specifically aquatic plants and algae. And I love the story about how in 1964, you jumped at an invitation to work on a scientific expedition to the Indian Ocean. And you were the only woman on the boat. EARLE: The headline in the Mombasa Daily Times (ph) the next day came out - \"Sylvia Sails Away With 70 Men. . . ZOMORODI: (Laughter). EARLE: . . . But She Expects No Problems\". And actually, the only problem that any of us really had was - here we are in a little boat on the surface of the ocean, and our job, our goal, was to explore the ocean. How do you do that from the top of the - and the ocean is beneath you? Well, we were lucky. We had some of the first scuba tanks and an air compressor onboard. And we were the first to actually - using scuba, to explore some of these legendary places, like Aldabra, parts of the Seychelles, little islands that - some were not populated by humans. And we were in the water, and the fish were seeing humans probably for the first time face-to-face the way fish see fish. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ZOMORODI: So you were one of the first humans to ever go scuba diving. You were also one of the first humans to live in an underwater habitat. You have spent hours at the bottom of the ocean during your lifetime. How did all that time down there change you, do you think? EARLE: So I've had a chance to live underwater 10 times now in various underwater laboratories and to use more than 30 different kinds of submarines, thousands of hours seeing the ocean from the inside out and realizing this is not just rocks and water; this is alive. It's a soup, like minestrone, but all the little pieces are alive. And then to realize that most people haven't had the depth and breadth of experience that comes with thousands of hours. And I think it's - we're right at the time of transition now that there are millions of divers all over the world who are now being able to go repeatedly back to the same areas and to be able to document the same individuals and to see what occurred to me was just natural. It's the way it is. ZOMORODI: But you say that you remember - when, actually, you were pretty young that you realized you saw that something bad was happening to nature, that marine life was thriving, and then it started disappearing, and you saw it happen. EARLE: Being a child in Florida when my parents moved there in 1948 and witnessing the changes in the coastline, the marshes that I first discovered - finding horseshoe crab eggs, these tiny little creatures prospering in really clear water and going out on a dock at night and seeing these bioluminescent creatures just flashing and glowing - and witnessing the change, that the waters became not beautiful, clear and blue but muddy - that was powerful incentive to say, why are we doing this? Well, it's progress. People need a place to live, and people love the waterfront. And there's not enough waterfront. So building these finger-fill areas to magnify the amount of land along the coast, building causeways out to the islands, blocking the flow of water, disturbing the seagrass beds, digging them up. And then they were gone. They're gone. So it was, I think, my experience as a witness, not reading about it, not looking at images but watching it happen, feeling empathy for the creatures in the sea as I got to know them. And I watched them disappear. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ZOMORODI: I can only imagine that you had that memory in mind when you decided to transition from doing research to policy. So in 1990, you were asked to become the chief scientist at a U. S. agency, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Like, why go work for the government? What was your thinking? What did you want to accomplish? EARLE: What really convinced me that, yes, I should be the chief scientist of NOAA was - within NOAA is a small but promising agency called the National Marine Sanctuary program, the counterpart of national parks that are actually housed in the Department of Interior. There are some marine-protected areas in the national park system, but most of the idea of ocean protection was embodied within this small but growing organization. So I thought, this is an opportunity to begin to develop the ethic of caring for the ocean in the same way that a hundred years ago, you know, we began looking at the land and the need for protection. ZOMORODI: You ended up being kind of a controversial figure there. You got oceans probably in the headlines. . . (LAUGHTER)ZOMORODI: . . . More than any other government official. I believe it was you who called attention to the fact that - what was it? - that the bluefin tuna was nearly extinct. Why were you so - like, why did people take issue with you? All the things you're saying seem hardly controversial. What was the tension that was going on in the '90s then? EARLE: Wasn't just the '90s; it's still there - the habit of thinking that the ocean is too big to fail. And we're still taking life in the ocean for granted. We still think that we have the capacity to take fish on a scale that we currently are and continue to do it forever. Sustainable extraction of ocean wildlife - tuna, swordfish, cod, shrimp, what we collectively regard as seafood. And if we just think of it as sea life that keeps us alive, we might make a transition from just looking at what lives in the ocean as something to eat or something to grind up for oil or products, to think of them as individuals, as part of the social structure of the ocean. We have made a transition with birds. We have made a transition with whales. There isn't such a large constituency of people who care about tuna and grouper for their own sake. And you're right. I got into trouble when I was at NOAA because I attended a Fisheries Council meeting, and I heard that in the Atlantic, the bluefin tuna populations were down by 90%. And I had the audacity to stand up and ask the question. So we only have 10% left from their numbers in the 1970s, a decline of 90% in 20 years from 1970 to 1990. I said, what are we trying to do, exterminate them? Because if we are, we're doing a great job. We only have 10% left to go. What are we waiting for? Let's go get them. I mean, that's when they started calling me the sturgeon general. ZOMORODI: (Laughter) OK, so fast-forward another decade. And in 2009, you won the TED Prize, and you founded an organization called Mission Blue. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)EARLE: My wish is a big wish. But if we can make it happen, it can truly change the world and help insure. . . ZOMORODI: And you said in your TED Talk at the time - like, you laid out a lot of what we've been discussing. But you said at the end of it that there is good news because 10% of the big fish remain, that there's time but not a lot of time to turn things around. So it's been, you know, about a dozen years since you gave your talk, since you founded Mission Blue. Tell me about how things have gone in those last 12 years. What have you been able to achieve with your organization and what haven't you? EARLE: I think one of the most important trends is the awareness and willingness to embrace places and to recognize that protecting nature, the natural systems, have benefits back to us in terms not just of better health, not just because they're beautiful - it's not even a choice anymore; it's necessary for our existence. We have to realize we're a part of nature. We can see the connection between trees and climate. We can see connection between the forests and the ocean, the phytoplankton capturing carbon, generating oxygen, maintaining a planet that works in our favor. This is common sense. You take care of your personal health because you want to live a long time, and you want to be happy. You want to be healthy. But we can't be happy or healthy if we don't take care of our life support system, the planet. So Mission Blue really has, as its core, to protect the ocean with a network of Hope Spots, protected areas large enough to save and restore the health of the planet. We now have 140 places around the world with champions for Hope Spots and communities gathering information about places that are not always in great condition. Some of them are. They start out either with some form of protection, or they're in beautiful, healthy condition. And the idea is to keep them that way and tell stories about what a good healthy system looks like. But there are also places like San Francisco Bay, not particularly in great shape as compared to what it was 500 years ago. But with care, it can improve. The 21st century humans are poised to be the heroes for all time because we're armed with a superpower of knowing that we have to change our attitude about the world that keeps us alive, that we can't just continue mining and, you know, taking and taking. We have to be aware of the consequences. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ZOMORODI: That's legendary oceanographer Sylvia Earle. You can see her full talk at ted. com.

EARLE: What really convinced me that, yes, I should be the chief scientist of NOAA was - within NOAA is a small but promising agency called the National Marine Sanctuary program, the counterpart of national parks that are actually housed in the Department of Interior. There are some marine-protected areas in the national park system, but most of the idea of ocean protection was embodied within this small but growing organization. So I thought, this is an opportunity to begin to develop the ethic of caring for the ocean in the same way that a hundred years ago, you know, we began looking at the land and the need for protection. ZOMORODI: You ended up being kind of a controversial figure there. You got oceans probably in the headlines. . . (LAUGHTER) ZOMORODI: . . . More than any other government official. I believe it was you who called attention to the fact that - what was it? - that the bluefin tuna was nearly extinct. Why were you so - like, why did people take issue with you? All the things you're saying seem hardly controversial. What was the tension that was going on in the '90s then? EARLE: Wasn't just the '90s; it's still there - the habit of thinking that the ocean is too big to fail. And we're still taking life in the ocean for granted. We still think that we have the capacity to take fish on a scale that we currently are and continue to do it forever. Sustainable extraction of ocean wildlife - tuna, swordfish, cod, shrimp, what we collectively regard as seafood. And if we just think of it as sea life that keeps us alive, we might make a transition from just looking at what lives in the ocean as something to eat or something to grind up for oil or products, to think of them as individuals, as part of the social structure of the ocean. We have made a transition with birds. We have made a transition with whales. There isn't such a large constituency of people who care about tuna and grouper for their own sake. And you're right. I got into trouble when I was at NOAA because I attended a Fisheries Council meeting, and I heard that in the Atlantic, the bluefin tuna populations were down by 90%. And I had the audacity to stand up and ask the question. So we only have 10% left from their numbers in the 1970s, a decline of 90% in 20 years from 1970 to 1990. I said, what are we trying to do, exterminate them? Because if we are, we're doing a great job. We only have 10% left to go. What are we waiting for? Let's go get them. I mean, that's when they started calling me the sturgeon general. ZOMORODI: (Laughter) OK, so fast-forward another decade. And in 2009, you won the TED Prize, and you founded an organization called Mission Blue. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) EARLE: My wish is a big wish. But if we can make it happen, it can truly change the world and help insure. . . ZOMORODI: And you said in your TED Talk at the time - like, you laid out a lot of what we've been discussing. But you said at the end of it that there is good news because 10% of the big fish remain, that there's time but not a lot of time to turn things around. So it's been, you know, about a dozen years since you gave your talk, since you founded Mission Blue. Tell me about how things have gone in those last 12 years. What have you been able to achieve with your organization and what haven't you? EARLE: I think one of the most important trends is the awareness and willingness to embrace places and to recognize that protecting nature, the natural systems, have benefits back to us in terms not just of better health, not just because they're beautiful - it's not even a choice anymore; it's necessary for our existence. We have to realize we're a part of nature. We can see the connection between trees and climate. We can see connection between the forests and the ocean, the phytoplankton capturing carbon, generating oxygen, maintaining a planet that works in our favor. This is common sense. You take care of your personal health because you want to live a long time, and you want to be happy. You want to be healthy. But we can't be happy or healthy if we don't take care of our life support system, the planet. So Mission Blue really has, as its core, to protect the ocean with a network of Hope Spots, protected areas large enough to save and restore the health of the planet. We now have 140 places around the world with champions for Hope Spots and communities gathering information about places that are not always in great condition. Some of them are. They start out either with some form of protection, or they're in beautiful, healthy condition. And the idea is to keep them that way and tell stories about what a good healthy system looks like. But there are also places like San Francisco Bay, not particularly in great shape as compared to what it was 500 years ago. But with care, it can improve. The 21st century humans are poised to be the heroes for all time because we're armed with a superpower of knowing that we have to change our attitude about the world that keeps us alive, that we can't just continue mining and, you know, taking and taking. We have to be aware of the consequences. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ZOMORODI: That's legendary oceanographer Sylvia Earle. You can see her full talk at ted. com.

And Ayana's recommendations are mainly for people living in developed, wealthier countries, not for island and coastal nations that depend on the ocean for their food and their livelihoods, like Madagascar. ALASDAIR HARRIS: Madagascar's the epicenter of global biodiversity. It's one of the hottest of the hot global biodiversity hot spots. It's vast. It's - there are very few roads. ZOMORODI: This is Alasdair Harris. He's a marine biologist who spent most of his career on the southern coast of the country. HARRIS: And when there are no roads, of course, people are really, really dependent on natural resources for food, for income, for identity. The Vezo people of southern Madagascar believe that they came from the union of a mermaid called Ampelamananisa and a fisherman. And that accounts for their knowledge of the tides and the seas and why they're such staggeringly good fishermen. Malagasy seafarers will sail vessels with no lights, no sounders, no engines, no GPS. They'll navigate the most complex barrier and fringing reef systems with Austral swells and incredibly dangerous tides blindfolded almost, except for the stars at nighttime. So when we talk about helping fishermen and women, often, it's not a question of finding something else to do. Fishing is what they do. Fishing is how they define themselves. It's their identity. ZOMORODI: Over the years, threats like industrial fishing and climate change jeopardized that identity. Reefs once teeming with marine life were on the verge of collapsing. So in 1998, Alasdair Harris arrived - an eager, young marine biologist with a big idea to save both the reefs and traditional fishing practices. Alasdair continues his story from the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)HARRIS: I first landed on the island of Madagascar two decades ago on a mission to document its marine natural history. I was mesmerized by the coral reefs I explored and certain I knew how to protect them because science provided all the answers. Close areas of the reef permanently. Coastal fishers simply needed to fish less. I approached elders in the village of Andavadoaka and recommended that they close off the healthiest and most diverse coral reefs to all forms of fishing to form a refuge to help stocks recover because, as the science tells us, after five or so years, fish populations inside those refuges would be much bigger, replenishing the fished areas outside, making everybody better off. That conversation didn't go so well. We were laughed out of the room. ZOMORODI: Were you literally laughed out of the room? HARRIS: It was considered - yeah. Of course, it was utterly naive, and it bore no account of the economic reality that they faced, which is fishing from one day to the next or what those people would do while we're waiting for those stocks to recover. ZOMORODI: OK, so here you come, Englishman going to the elders of these fishing communities with your grand plans - and just to be clear, like, what exactly were you suggesting? HARRIS: Well, we know that when we safeguard and set aside certain areas of ocean, perhaps 10%, 20%, 30% of the ocean, within what we call a refuge, a marine reserve, a protected area, amazing things can happen. The life that's closed off within that reserve will grow. It will reproduce. It will eventually start to throw out much bigger fish, juveniles, larvae into the more fished areas outside and help regenerate those areas as well as rebuild those fisheries. So my initial idea was to work with communities to zone off areas of these reefs as these permanent marine reserves. Of course, the hubris involved in this - the hubris involved in a 20-year-old going to Madagascar with a view to doing something about coral reef conservation beggars belief, I appreciate that. ZOMORODI: So they didn't go for the idea because you didn't really consider their day-to-day reality. Like, even if it was a great idea, they have to feed their families, like, today, right? Did their situation surprise you? HARRIS: The scale of it was very shocking to me. And seeing children in fishing communities go hungry at the same time as foreign industrial boats are fishing with impunity offshore - and this is going on around coasts like Madagascar and low-income tropical coastal developing states year in, year out. ZOMORODI: OK, so you have this initial setback, a bit of humiliation, but then you come up with a new idea. Well, not exactly a new idea - really more a new framing, right? HARRIS: Absolutely. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)HARRIS: That initial rejection taught me that conservation is, at its core, a journey in listening deeply, to understand the pressures and realities that communities face through their dependence on nature. This idea grew into an organization that brought a new approach to ocean conservation by working to rebuild fisheries with coastal communities. Then, as now, the work started by listening, and what we learned astonished us. Back in the dry south of Madagascar, we learned that one species was immensely important for villagers - this remarkable octopus. The day octopus - octopus cyanea, it's called - a hugely charismatic species. But it's a very lucrative fishery, particularly for women in these coastal communities. And it grows exponentially once it's settled on the coral reef. And so we went back with another proposal, which was - how about we just start with maybe 10% of the fishing ground, but only for one species and only for six months? We think you're going to see some pretty explosive results. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)HARRIS: The community thought so, too, opting to close a small area of reef to octopus fishing temporarily, using a customary social code, invoking blessings from the ancestors to prevent poaching. When that reef reopened to fishing six months later, none of us were prepared for what happened next. Catches soared, with men and women landing more and bigger octopus than anyone had seen for years. Neighboring villages saw the fishing boom and drew up their own closures, spreading the model virally along hundreds of miles of coastline. When we ran the numbers, we saw that these communities, among the poorest on Earth, had found a way to double their money in a matter of months by fishing less. One closure became three closures and then five. And fast-forward and we've seen hundreds and hundreds along thousands of kilometers of coastline. And we've studied the impacts of these closures, and they've led to really important and significant increases in catches, more and larger animals that mean higher incomes for these communities. So it's been a real fisheries management success entirely from the bottom up, and it's gone to about a dozen countries now. ZOMORODI: So these closures, then, is this the way forward for conservation in these fishing communities? HARRIS: Well, that in and of itself is not necessarily a conservation effort. That's just focusing on those target fisheries. But I guess you could liken it to a catalyst that has enabled us to then revisit those first conversations about, well, how about we close off those areas now, now that we know what can happen? ZOMORODI: So is it kind of like bridging the needs and the rights of the local people with the desires of the scientists and conservationists? HARRIS: That's a really good question. I guess we're trying to address what we might call conservation's people problem. So the world I work in has an ugly history of conflict and human rights abuses, which have often set people and conservation against one another. Now, of course, that's really not OK, but it's also a massive paradox because fishermen and -women and conservationists really want the same thing - a healthy and diverse ocean. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)HARRIS: The real magic went beyond profit. Leaders from Andavadoaka joined forces with two dozen neighboring communities to establish a vast conservation area along dozens of miles of coastline. They outlawed fishing with poison and mosquito nets and set aside permanent refuges around threatened coral reefs and mangroves, including - to my astonishment - those same sites that I'd flagged just two years earlier, when my evangelism for marine protection was so roundly rejected. They created a community-led protected area, a democratic system for local marine governance that was totally unimaginable just a few years earlier. And they didn't stop there. Within five years, they'd secured legal rights from the state to manage over 200 square miles of ocean, eliminating destructive industrial trawlers from the waters. ZOMORODI: So I guess to go back to your original hope, Alasdair, when you first arrived in southern Madagascar, in addition to better fishing, are the reefs also healing? HARRIS: Well, we've helped those fishermen monitor those sites with scuba, and every year, the reefs are getting healthier. The resident biomass, the sheer quantity of fish in the water, has got greater. And it's become a really important scientific reference site that's demonstrating the power of locally led marine conservation, not just for fisheries but now also for that broader objective of ecosystem conservation. But we've got to a place that we could never have got to had we not put the interests of those communities first. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ZOMORODI: That's Alasdair Harris.

I'm Manoush Zomorodi. And today on the show, ways that we can help save our oceans and the fish that swim in them. AYANA ELIZABETH JOHNSON: We need to change our relationship with the ocean. Our expectation that we will have heaps of fresh fish in the supermarket of whatever species we desire every day of the year is completely out of sync with what nature can provide. ZOMORODI: This is Ayana Elizabeth Johnson. She's a marine biologist and also a policy analyst, a researcher, an inventor, a podcaster, all in an effort to teach us how we can save the oceans. And Ayana says globally, we have got caught 90% of large fish. Tuna, salmon, shark, swordfish - they're all in trouble. But what does that mean then for us when we go to the supermarket? What else have we got here? They've got sockeye salmon. Does not specify. . . Because knowing what's OK to buy can be confusing, even when you're trying your best. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Some of the signs that you will see, they will tell you. Like, the snapper's rated yellow. ZOMORODI: Oh, OK. So the snapper's rated yellow. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON $1: It's still - but the (inaudible) rated yellow doesn't really mean it's bad. It means that there may be some concerns or harm. ZOMORODI: Some stores have a green, yellow and red color-coded system. And when you say some concerns or harm, what do you mean? But can we be really sure that green is sustainable? Wait a minute. They say they're rated, but it doesn't say what they are. There are also terms like all natural or responsibly farmed. There's Branzini, farm raised. And it says it's responsibly farmed. And then there is sustainably caught. I think that's good. JOHNSON: Sustainable does not have a legal definition. ZOMORODI: Got you. JOHNSON: Responsibly and sustainably - like, these are not words that have clear standards or verification processes or oversight. It's something like 20% of seafood is mislabeled in grocery stores. ZOMORODI: And so when you say mislabeled, do you mean, like, exaggerating the sustainability? JOHNSON: I mean it's not even the species that they say it is. ZOMORODI: Oh. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)JOHNSON: You mislabel seafood for profit. So you label it as whatever will get you the highest price or whatever you have a quota for. And it varies depending on the species up to, like, 40% or even 50% for things like snapper and sea bass. And, like, if it's not even the right species, like, are the other labels correct? So if the consumer does, you know, do your darndest to do your research and pick things that are sustainable, there's still a big chance that you would get it wrong through really no fault of your own. ZOMORODI: Like, why is that? Why make it so hard for the consumer? JOHNSON: The supply chain is so opaque, and there are so many steps in it. And we really often don't know where our seafood is coming from. And about 80% of the seafood that we eat in the U. S. is imported. ZOMORODI: Eighty percent. JOHNSON: It's coming from all over the world. And also, about 1 in 4 of the fish that we eat here were actually caught in the U. S. and probably sent overseas to Asia or other places to be processed and then reimported. It's not really what we think about when we think about sort of commodities trading or import and export, but it really is. ZOMORODI: And Ayana says to keep up this complicated supply chain, industrial fishing vessels have to hunt fish by the thousands. JOHNSON: There are these massive fishing vessels that have, like, full processing factories onboard. Often, they're staying at sea for months if not years. Often, the labor conditions are abysmal and often fishing with nets the size of multiple football fields or lines with hundreds if not thousands of hooks on them. So we're talking about, like, a massive industry not, like, a cute fishing trip. ZOMORODI: And that means using pretty sophisticated tools to track down the dwindling fish populations. JOHNSON: You have sonar. You have helicopters and spotter planes because we've overfished to such an extent that we have to use the most advanced technology we have available to us in order to find the fish. ZOMORODI: And the shrimp industry uses some of the most harmful methods. JOHNSON: Shrimp is the most popular seafood in the United States, and it's one of the least sustainable. Often, like, 10% or less of what they catch is shrimp, and the rest is thrown back dead. ZOMORODI: And it's not just wild-caught shrimp. JOHNSON: Farmed shrimp often destroys mangroves and other coastal habitats usually in Southeast Asia, which makes those areas more prone to storms. They use a lot of pesticides and antibiotics. Worker exploitation is a huge problem. So I would say if you're looking for just, like, a few things to cut out, give up shrimp unless you know that it's, like, you know, trap-caught pink shrimp from Oregon because those fisheries are sustainable and, like, really deliberate. ZOMORODI: OK. So for most shrimp, farmed and wild are both bad. So maybe just don't eat it. But for other fish, is farmed better than wild? JOHNSON: I mean, the answer is, unfortunately, it depends. We need to think about - the farmed fish, what are they eating? We're catching wild fish, small ones, to feed to farmed fish, that would be bigger ones. Eating farmed carnivorous fish doesn't really make sense, right? Like, if we think about agriculture on land, would we farm lions? Would we think that that is sustainable? Like, that is essentially what we're doing when we think about farming tuna or salmon. These are magnificent fish, which are quite high up the food chain. ZOMORODI: OK. So then, Ayana, what would be your ideal shopping trip? Like, you'd avoid the shrimp, wild or farmed. You would avoid the bigger fish. But then what would you eat? JOHNSON: I think the first thing I should say is, as opposed to choosing fish from anywhere in the world where you have no idea, eating U. S. -caught or locally caught seafood is a really good start. I personally support Iliamna Fish Company, this Indigenous Alaskan family that fishes for salmon in Bristol Bay, which is sustainable. Eating lower on the food chain is another really important thing, right? Instead of eating these top predators like tunas, we could be eating sardines and anchovies. That will be more sustainable. Eating farmed shellfish, eating farmed seaweed, that is something you can feel comfortable eating as much as you want, so, you know, enjoy. ZOMORODI: I think it would be best for me to buy the small stuff, right? Like anchovies - I love anchovies - and sardines. They're a little too stinky for me, but if I want to stop eating, like, tuna steak, I got to find something else that's delicious. Ayana Elizabeth Johnson is a marine biologist. You can find all her talks at ted. com. And please check out her podcast, \"How To Save A Planet. \" MANOUSH ZOMORODI, HOST:   It's the TED Radio Hour from NPR. I'm Manoush Zomorodi. And today on the show, ways that we can help save our oceans and the fish that swim in them. AYANA ELIZABETH JOHNSON: We need to change our relationship with the ocean. Our expectation that we will have heaps of fresh fish in the supermarket of whatever species we desire every day of the year is completely out of sync with what nature can provide. ZOMORODI: This is Ayana Elizabeth Johnson. She's a marine biologist and also a policy analyst, a researcher, an inventor, a podcaster, all in an effort to teach us how we can save the oceans. And Ayana says globally, we have got caught 90% of large fish. Tuna, salmon, shark, swordfish - they're all in trouble. But what does that mean then for us when we go to the supermarket? What else have we got here? They've got sockeye salmon. Does not specify. . . Because knowing what's OK to buy can be confusing, even when you're trying your best. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Some of the signs that you will see, they will tell you. Like, the snapper's rated yellow. ZOMORODI: Oh, OK. So the snapper's rated yellow. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON $1: It's still - but the (inaudible) rated yellow doesn't really mean it's bad. It means that there may be some concerns or harm. ZOMORODI: Some stores have a green, yellow and red color-coded system. And when you say some concerns or harm, what do you mean? But can we be really sure that green is sustainable? Wait a minute. They say they're rated, but it doesn't say what they are. There are also terms like all natural or responsibly farmed. There's Branzini, farm raised. And it says it's responsibly farmed. And then there is sustainably caught. I think that's good. JOHNSON: Sustainable does not have a legal definition. ZOMORODI: Got you. JOHNSON: Responsibly and sustainably - like, these are not words that have clear standards or verification processes or oversight. It's something like 20% of seafood is mislabeled in grocery stores. ZOMORODI: And so when you say mislabeled, do you mean, like, exaggerating the sustainability? JOHNSON: I mean it's not even the species that they say it is. ZOMORODI: Oh. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) JOHNSON: You mislabel seafood for profit. So you label it as whatever will get you the highest price or whatever you have a quota for. And it varies depending on the species up to, like, 40% or even 50% for things like snapper and sea bass. And, like, if it's not even the right species, like, are the other labels correct? So if the consumer does, you know, do your darndest to do your research and pick things that are sustainable, there's still a big chance that you would get it wrong through really no fault of your own. ZOMORODI: Like, why is that? Why make it so hard for the consumer? JOHNSON: The supply chain is so opaque, and there are so many steps in it. And we really often don't know where our seafood is coming from. And about 80% of the seafood that we eat in the U. S. is imported. ZOMORODI: Eighty percent. JOHNSON: It's coming from all over the world. And also, about 1 in 4 of the fish that we eat here were actually caught in the U. S. and probably sent overseas to Asia or other places to be processed and then reimported. It's not really what we think about when we think about sort of commodities trading or import and export, but it really is. ZOMORODI: And Ayana says to keep up this complicated supply chain, industrial fishing vessels have to hunt fish by the thousands. JOHNSON: There are these massive fishing vessels that have, like, full processing factories onboard. Often, they're staying at sea for months if not years. Often, the labor conditions are abysmal and often fishing with nets the size of multiple football fields or lines with hundreds if not thousands of hooks on them. So we're talking about, like, a massive industry not, like, a cute fishing trip. ZOMORODI: And that means using pretty sophisticated tools to track down the dwindling fish populations. JOHNSON: You have sonar. You have helicopters and spotter planes because we've overfished to such an extent that we have to use the most advanced technology we have available to us in order to find the fish. ZOMORODI: And the shrimp industry uses some of the most harmful methods. JOHNSON: Shrimp is the most popular seafood in the United States, and it's one of the least sustainable. Often, like, 10% or less of what they catch is shrimp, and the rest is thrown back dead. ZOMORODI: And it's not just wild-caught shrimp. JOHNSON: Farmed shrimp often destroys mangroves and other coastal habitats usually in Southeast Asia, which makes those areas more prone to storms. They use a lot of pesticides and antibiotics. Worker exploitation is a huge problem. So I would say if you're looking for just, like, a few things to cut out, give up shrimp unless you know that it's, like, you know, trap-caught pink shrimp from Oregon because those fisheries are sustainable and, like, really deliberate. ZOMORODI: OK. So for most shrimp, farmed and wild are both bad. So maybe just don't eat it. But for other fish, is farmed better than wild? JOHNSON: I mean, the answer is, unfortunately, it depends. We need to think about - the farmed fish, what are they eating? We're catching wild fish, small ones, to feed to farmed fish, that would be bigger ones. Eating farmed carnivorous fish doesn't really make sense, right? Like, if we think about agriculture on land, would we farm lions? Would we think that that is sustainable? Like, that is essentially what we're doing when we think about farming tuna or salmon. These are magnificent fish, which are quite high up the food chain. ZOMORODI: OK. So then, Ayana, what would be your ideal shopping trip? Like, you'd avoid the shrimp, wild or farmed. You would avoid the bigger fish. But then what would you eat? JOHNSON: I think the first thing I should say is, as opposed to choosing fish from anywhere in the world where you have no idea, eating U. S. -caught or locally caught seafood is a really good start. I personally support Iliamna Fish Company, this Indigenous Alaskan family that fishes for salmon in Bristol Bay, which is sustainable. Eating lower on the food chain is another really important thing, right? Instead of eating these top predators like tunas, we could be eating sardines and anchovies. That will be more sustainable. Eating farmed shellfish, eating farmed seaweed, that is something you can feel comfortable eating as much as you want, so, you know, enjoy. ZOMORODI: I think it would be best for me to buy the small stuff, right? Like anchovies - I love anchovies - and sardines. They're a little too stinky for me, but if I want to stop eating, like, tuna steak, I got to find something else that's delicious. Ayana Elizabeth Johnson is a marine biologist.

I'm Manoush Zomorodi. And this week, we are diving back into the sea for Part 2 of our ocean series. And I want to start with the biggest underwater creature there is - the whale, which, despite its size, can be really hard to spot. ASHA DE VOS: They're huge, but they live in this gigantic space - 70% of our planet, right? So you just stand and stare out at the horizon, and you hope that an animal will turn up. ZOMORODI: This is marine biologist Asha de Vos. And before she ever had a chance to see a whale, Asha fell in love with how they sound. Back in college. . . DE VOS: I did a project on sperm whales and their acoustics. And I was listening to this cacophony. (SOUNDBITE OF SPERM WHALES CLICKING)DE VOS: And I was just like, you know, this world sounds so remarkable. ZOMORODI: These are the clicking sounds that sperm whales make. DE VOS: So sperm whales are the largest toothed whales. And so when we listen to them, they just have these beautiful patterns, series of clicks that they use for communicating with each other, for finding their food and stuff like that. (SOUNDBITE OF HUMPBACK WHALE SINGING)ZOMORODI: And this is a humpback whale. DE VOS: They have the most complex songs. They're super beautiful. They evolve. I mean, it's quite magical. ZOMORODI: But Asha says whale songs are more than beautiful. They help whales echolocate, to find food and navigate their environment. DE VOS: Their eyesight isn't very good. And so their world really depends so heavily on their ability to hear. ZOMORODI: And, of course, to communicate with each other, like. . . DE VOS: Mothers probably reprimanding their babies. . . (SOUNDBITE OF HUMPBACK WHALE SINGING)DE VOS: . . . Partners looking for mates, right? (SOUNDBITE OF HUMPBACK WHALE SINGING)DE VOS: Calling out, hey, beautiful. There's a response, right? They have to talk to each other. How else are we going to have more whales in our future? (SOUNDBITE OF HUMPBACK WHALE SINGING)ZOMORODI: Asha grew to love whales even more when she finally had the chance to observe them up close. DE VOS: It all began with an encounter with six blue whales and a floating pile of whale poop off the southeast coast of Sri Lanka. And that's literally my eureka moment. ZOMORODI: Because, Asha says, whale poop - yes, whale poop - is pretty spectacular. DE VOS: Oh, my goodness. It is the most beautiful animal poop ever. ZOMORODI: (Laughter) Wait, what is so beautiful about whale poop? DE VOS: It's bright red. Literally, it's, like, brick red in color, and that's because these whales feed on shrimp. So one thing is it's really easy to find for researchers like myself who think whale poop is the bee's knees. ZOMORODI: (Laughter). DE VOS: But, you know, it is - like, poop is a clue to the secret world, right? Like, it allows us to learn more about what they feed on. But it's also incredibly important for our environment. ZOMORODI: Here's Asha de Vos on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)DE VOS: As whales dive to the depths to feed and come up to the surface to breathe, they actually release these enormous fecal plumes. This whale pump, as it's called, actually brings essential limiting nutrients from the depths to the surface waters where they stimulate the growth of phytoplankton that forms the base of all marine food chains. So really, having more whales in the oceans pooping is really beneficial to the entire ecosystem. Whales are also known to undertake some of the longest migrations of all mammals. As they do so, they transport fertilizer in the form of their feces from places that have it to places that need it. But what's really cool is that they're also really important after they're dead. Whale carcasses provide a feast to some 400-odd species, including the eel-shaped, slime-producing hagfish. Whale carcasses are also known to transport about 190,000 tons of carbon, which is the equivalent of that produced by 80,000 cars per year, from the atmosphere to the deep oceans and therefore help to delay global warming. So over the 200 years of whaling, when we were busy killing and removing these carcasses from the oceans, we likely altered the rate and geographical distribution of these whale falls and, as a result, probably led to a number of extinctions of species that were most specialized and dependent on these carcasses for their survival. ZOMORODI: You know, I don't think I ever realized how important whales are to all the life cycles that are taking place in the oceans. And it sort of sounds like 200 years ago, that was the ideal. Like, the ecosystems were thriving. Whales are pooping. They're dying in exactly the right places. And life in the ocean is flourishing. Then, of course, we humans come along, and we kind of screw everything up. DE VOS: Yeah. So we basically reduced populations of whales by, you know - down to maybe, like, 10- to 20% of pre-whaling numbers - right? - which is a huge blow because these are gigantic animals that, as you can tell, have many roles to play in the oceans, right? And these things are so deeply interconnected that, you know, it's almost like a game of Jenga. You take a piece out, and you take another piece out, and it starts to wobble. And then you take that third piece out, and it all collapses because everything's so deeply intertwined, right? So you think about that drastic impact that we had over those, you know, years of whaling and the long-lasting impacts. And we're still trying to recover from that. ZOMORODI: Over centuries, humans have treated the ocean as a place of endless resources. Now, between overfishing, carbon emissions, pollution and more, our oceans are in trouble. But it's not too late. And so today on the show, saving our seas - an SOS from the ocean. From our small individual actions to big community efforts, what we can all do to stop the destruction of our underwater ecosystems and why conservation isn't just about saving marine life but also saving our planet. This isn't the first time that we've tried to save the ocean and the whales. In the '70s, the Save the Whales movement became one of the most successful conservation campaigns ever. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"SAVE THE WHALES\")CHEECH AND CHONG: (Singing) Save the whales. Oh, funky momma, save the whales. ZOMORODI: Mainstream culture fell in love with whales. There were bumper stickers, T-shirts, fliers, petitions and even entire albums, like Roger Payne's \"Songs Of The Humpback Whale. \"(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)DE VOS: That concerted effort, those voices, really made a difference because, as a result, there were - you know, it was a domino effect. The International Whaling Commission moved forward and put down this moratorium to stop whaling. And so it was a time of change. And the whales that are coming back today, that's all thanks to the work that was done, you know, a few decades ago by people coming together and saying this is not going to work. We have to protect our whales. Let's save the whales. ZOMORODI: So the Save the Whales movement really worked for stopping commercial whaling worldwide. But whales are still facing a lot of issues today. First - ship strikes. DE VOS: All across the world, we have these massive shipping highways transporting goods throughout the world. And these shipping lanes often overlap with really important areas for these whales, like their feeding grounds, for example. And so they can actually hit them, and it can be lethal. And these animals can die. ZOMORODI: Another problem - fishing nets. DE VOS: If they get entangled at depth, they can't come up to the surface to breathe, so they drown. And as mammals, they do have to come to the surface to breathe. And if they get entangled at the surface, they can't dive down to the depths to feed, so then they can starve. ZOMORODI: And finally - something we hardly ever think about in the ocean - sound pollution. DE VOS: Now, in areas where you have heavy ship traffic for example what can happen, especially with species like blue whales, is that their sound and the vocalization that they create is at the same frequency as noise created by the ship. So it's like being at a cocktail party, for example. Everyone's talking at the same time, and you know someone said your name, but you don't know where that sound is coming from. You know, it's just a murmur of sound. And so for whales, if everything's at the same frequency - if I'm talking to you and someone's also talking across us at the same volume, at the same frequency, then I can't hear you. So how do I find my mate? ZOMORODI: But it also must be, like, pretty exhausting for these animals to have noise constantly bombarding them day in and day out. DE VOS: Yeah. You know, I think it is incredibly stressful. And there's this, I think, a beautiful study that was actually done off the East Coast of the U. S. , and they were looking at stress hormones in whale poop samples, right? And so when 9/11 happened, they looked at the samples. And very surprisingly, they found that the whales were less stressed soon after 9/11. ZOMORODI: Wow. DE VOS: Exactly, right? So they stopped the shipping in the Bay of Fundy for a short period of time. Ship noise dropped. And that was reflected in the stress levels of these whales, right? So we don't think about that. And stress is - you know, it's a silent killer, right? Like, it can impact reproductive capabilities. It can affect mother-calf pairs, right? If there's too much noise, the mother and calf maybe can't communicate. What if they get separated, right? There's a lot of knock-on effects as a result as well. ZOMORODI: OK. So someone listening is like, all right, I get it. You - the ocean is interconnected. And whales, they affect so many other creatures. And clearly, humans have a big impact, too. But what if that person listening is like, I don't even live near an ocean. What can I possibly do? DE VOS: Yeah. So, you know, I always tell people - you know, we always say all roads lead to Rome. I always say all waterways lead to the ocean. If you live anywhere, there's typically some water source, whether it's a tiny spring or the water in your tap or a big lake or a river. Everything that goes in there washes out into the ocean, right? And so we are connected. I think we can all make a difference. I think we can all start to think about our individual lives, our individual capacities, our consumer habits - right? - like, what plastics are we using? Where are we dumping it? But also, just simple things like sharing these stories, right? You know, we talk so much about the conservation issues, which create apathy, right? But I want people to talk about the conservation wins. I want people to talk about that magic, about how beautiful blue whale poop is - right? - how amazing their sounds are and the fact that that's how they see the world. I want people to remember that there's a lot of amazing things that happen out there, and that ocean does truly, truly keep us alive. ZOMORODI: That's marine biologist Asha de Vos.

For the first time, doctors have simply infused CRISPR into patients' bloodstreams to try and help them. And it appears to have worked. NPR health correspondent, Rob Stein, has more. ROB STEIN, BYLINE: Patrick Doherty had always been really active - trekking the Himalayas, hiking trails in Spain. But he suddenly started feeling pins and needles in his fingers and toes. And his feet got cold. And then one day, he noticed he was running out of breath just walking his dog in County Donegal in Ireland, where he lives. PATRICK DOHERTY: I'm kind of getting a bit breathless going up a small hillside here in Donegal, which - there are many (laughter). So I realized something was wrong. Something was wrong. STEIN: Turns out, he had inherited a rare but devastating disease that killed his dad, known as amyloidosis. A deformed protein was damaging parts of his body, like nerves in his fingers and toes and his heart. He had watched two uncles and neighbors also die awful deaths from amyloidosis. DOHERTY: It's just dreadful. STEIN: So Doherty, who's 65, was thrilled when he found out that doctors were testing a new way to treat amyloidosis, using CRISPR, which allows scientists to make very precise changes in DNA. DOHERTY: I thought, fantastic. I couldn't believe my luck. STEIN: CRISPR has already started helping patients suffering from the blood disorders sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia. And doctors are trying to use it to treat cancer and restore vision to people blinded by a rare genetic disorder. But those experiments involve taking cells out of the body, editing them in the lab and infusing them back in, or injecting CRISPR directly into cells that need fixing. The study Doherty volunteered for is the first in which doctors are simply infusing the gene editor and letting it find its own way to the right gene in the right place - in this case, a gene in cells in the liver pumping out the destructive protein. John Leonard is the CEO of Intellia Therapeutics, the company sponsoring the study. JOHN LEONARD: This is the first example in which CRISPR-Cas9 is injected the into the bloodstream - in other words, systemic administration, where we use it as a way to reach a tissue that's far away from the site of injection and very specifically edit particular disease-causing genes. STEIN: And it looks like it worked. Doctors infused billions of microscopic structures, known as nanoparticles, into Doherty and five other volunteers. Each nanoparticle carried the genetic code for the CRISPR gene editor. The nanoparticles made their way to the liver and unleashed an army of CRISPR gene editors, which honed in on the target gene to disable it. Within weeks, the levels of bad protein causing the disease plummeted. JULIAN GILLMORE: It's amazing. It's - you know, it's phenomenal. It really is exciting. STEIN: Dr. Julian Gillmore is leading the study at the University College London. GILLMORE: This has the potential to completely revolutionize the outcome for these patients who have lived with this disease in their family for many generations. You know, it's decimated some families that I've been looking after. So, you know, this is amazing. STEIN: The patients will have to be followed much longer, and many more patients will have to be treated, to make sure the treatment's as safe as it looks and to determine how much it's helping patients. But, Gillmore says, the approach could help those struck by a far more common version of the disease and provides the first good evidence that CRISPR could be used like this to treat many other, much more common diseases for which taking cells out of the body or directly injecting CRISPR isn't realistic, like heart disease, muscular dystrophy and maybe even brain disorders like Alzheimer's. FYODOR URNOV: This is a wonderful day for the future of gene editing as a medicine. STEIN: Fyodor Urnov is a professor of genetics at the University of California, Berkeley. URNOV: What's striking about these new data is not merely the evidence of safety and efficacy but the avenues or highways it opens up for us in terms of traveling to new destinations in the world of genomic medicine. STEIN: He says, it's a new world. URNOV: We as a species are watching this remarkable new show called \"Our Gene-Edited Future. \"STEIN: For his part, Patrick Doherty is thrilled. DOHERTY: I feel fantastic. I feel fantastic. STEIN: He started feeling better within weeks of the treatment. DOHERTY: I definitely notice an improvement in terms of my mobility, my heart, my moving about. I'm walking again. I do 15,000, 20,000 steps a day - weekend I go up again hill-walking with the dog. STEIN: Doherty's looking forward to the future again. DOHERTY: I'm really thankful for it - really thankful for it. STEIN: And he hopes CRISPR will help some of his friends and relatives avoid the terrible fate his father, uncles and friends suffered. Rob Stein, NPR News. (SOUNDBITE OF EVOCATIV'S \"VESPER\") RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:   Scientists are reporting another big advance using the revolutionary gene-editing technique called CRISPR to treat diseases. For the first time, doctors have simply infused CRISPR into patients' bloodstreams to try and help them. And it appears to have worked. NPR health correspondent, Rob Stein, has more. ROB STEIN, BYLINE: Patrick Doherty had always been really active - trekking the Himalayas, hiking trails in Spain. But he suddenly started feeling pins and needles in his fingers and toes. And his feet got cold. And then one day, he noticed he was running out of breath just walking his dog in County Donegal in Ireland, where he lives.

For the first time ever, they've seen a black hole gobbling a neutron star. NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce reports on how scientists were able to spy on this cosmic snack. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE, BYLINE: Black holes are famous for their gravitational pull, which nothing, not even light, can escape. And then there's neutron stars. MAYA FISHBACH: Neutron stars are very weird. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Maya Fishbach is an astronomer at Northwestern University. She says neutron stars are made of protons and neutrons, the stuff you find inside atoms. But they're crushed together into a shockingly dense sphere. FISHBACH: That's, you know, heavier than our sun and can comfortably fit within the city of Chicago. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Now scientists say they've caught a black hole eating a neutron star in one giant gulp. And then 10 days later, they saw another black hole do the same thing. FISHBACH: For these particular systems, the neutron star would have just plunged into the black hole without emitting any light. GREENFIELDBOYCE: If all this noshing didn't put out detectable light, then how did researchers spot it? By sensing gravitational waves. Those are the ripples in space-time created by powerful, violent events out in the universe. Gravitational waves were predicted to exist by Albert Einstein over a century ago but not detected until 2015. Chase Kimball is a graduate student at Northwestern. He says the ability to register gravitational waves has been a game-changer for astronomy. CHASE KIMBALL: So it's like, you know, flipping the sound on on a silent movie or something like that where we'd previously just been, you know, watching the universe. And now we can listen to it through these gravitational waves. GREENFIELDBOYCE: In this case, the black holes gobbling neutron stars generated gravitational waves that took about a billion years to reach Earth. In January of 2020, the waves triggered three giant detectors. One of them was the LIGO Hanford Observatory in Washington State. Mike Landry is in charge here.

GREENFIELDBOYCE: He cleans his shoes on a scrubber, then puts on white booties and a cap to enter a warehouse-sized clean room. LANDRY: We're just transitioning into the main experimental hall. GREENFIELDBOYCE: He walks beside a huge metal tube that stretches off into the distance. It's more than two miles long. There's another tube here just like it. They're joined together. From above, they look like the capital letter L. When a gravitational wave rolls through here, it literally warps and stretches space just a tiny, tiny bit - like, a fraction of the width of a subatomic particle. This detector can catch that change thanks to laser beams traveling inside each arm of the L. LANDRY: You have a real sensitive measure of the change in the relative length of the arms. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Landry shows off big pieces of new equipment waiting to be installed. He says over the last six years, gravitational wave detectors have logged more than 50 extreme events, like pairs of black holes merging or a couple of neutron stars colliding and now black holes eating neutron stars. LANDRY: I found that to be an astonishing speed to mature the field. I think that's been a surprise and a good surprise. GREENFIELDBOYCE: The upgrades currently being made should be done by next summer. And who knows what kind of exotic thing they'll find then?

Sick people stop taking their medications. Medical devices stop working. Heat and mold threaten everyone's health. The federal government is supposed to help prevent that disaster after the disaster. But an NPR investigation finds that the people who need help the most are often less likely to get it and the government knows this. NPR's Rebecca Hersher has the first of three reports about who gets help after disasters. REBECCA HERSHER, BYLINE: Donnie Speight's house in Louisiana is a couple miles off the main road in a stand of pine trees. The gray mobile home is in a quiet, secluded spot. That's why she and her husband Steve chose it. Donnie and Steve lived in this mobile home for nearly 11 years. Steve was a Vietnam veteran. He had serious diabetes and mobility problems, and it took all Donnie had to care for him. DONNIE SPEIGHT: I'm 77 years old. I got arthritis like crazy. It's in my hands and my arms, my neck, my hips, my knees. I don't know how I was doing it. HERSHER: That was life before last August. That's when a Category 4 hurricane, Laura, hit the area head on. SPEIGHT: I heard my grandson stay, watch out. And all of a sudden, bam (ph) - that window break. HERSHER: A tree punched a 2-foot hole in the roof of the bedroom, knocked out the electricity and destroyed the air conditioner. Without power, Donnie couldn't use their electric lift to get Steve in and out of bed safely. She couldn't charge his electric wheelchair. It was dangerously hot in the house. The Speights didn't have home insurance. They lived on a fixed income. They didn't have money to repair the damage on their own. So Donnie applied for help from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA. She hoped she could get enough money to fix the hole in the roof and get electricity and air conditioning restored as quickly as possible. FEMA is supposed to be the safety net after a disaster, but a growing body of research finds that FEMA is failing to provide adequate help to some of the most vulnerable disaster survivors - poor people. Junia Howell is a sociologist at Boston University's Center for Antiracist Research. JUNIA HOWELL: There's a broader discussion of, what is federal aid for and who should we be giving it to? HERSHER: For years, researchers including Howell have found that FEMA's programs work in favor of wealthier Americans. But the agency has denied that happens and refused to share its own analyses with journalists or researchers. Now, internal documents obtained by NPR through a public records request make it clear that the agency has been aware of the disparity since at least 2019. HOWELL: The thing that I think is really important to highlight and what this data show is that those who are more privileged are getting more out of FEMA. HERSHER: Howell says FEMA's internal analyses confirmed that low-income survivors are less likely to receive money to repair damage and pay rent. When poor people do receive assistance, they tend to receive less. But why? The data suggests a few reasons. Poor people are more likely to be denied money because the damage to their house is deemed insufficient by FEMA. And people who can't prove that they personally own their home or are named on a lease are also cut off from assistance. FEMA now acknowledges that the disparities are a problem. Keith Turi is FEMA's assistant administrator for recovery. KEITH TURI: Let me just say that we do understand our obligation to support disaster survivors in an equitable way. That is a responsibility that we have here at FEMA. And candidly, we have work to do there and we're committed to following through on it. HERSHER: A lot of people are counting on FEMA to address disparities quickly. Climate change is driving more frequent storms, fires and floods. Across the country, thousands of families are still struggling to find stable housing months or even years after a disaster. And that means a lot of people are forced to move. Craig Fugate led FEMA between 2009 and 2017. CRAIG FUGATE: I call it exporting the poor because no matter what you say you're doing, the end result is the poor are being displaced. I've watched it through Florida's hurricanes. It's not fair. And I think that's why we have to rethink the programs. HERSHER: Nearly a year after Hurricane Laura, Donnie Speight is struggling to hold the pieces of her life together. SPEIGHT: See; I filed for FEMA on this trailer. But all I got was 1,649. HERSHER: Sixteen hundred forty-nine dollars - 1,200 to fix the roof plus $449 for a generator. But prices for repairs and equipment skyrocket after major disasters. Donnie says the cheapest generator you could find was $900, so there went the couple's savings. A contractor told them the roof repair would cost twice as much as FEMA gave them. They didn't have any way to make up the difference. FEMA doesn't take into account a person's savings when they decide how much money to give. Donnie and Steve lived with the hole in the bedroom ceiling all winter through the deep freeze, through countless rainstorms. Steve's health deteriorated. SPEIGHT: I went through some hard times there with Steve, but we would have been married 39 years the second of this month. HERSHER: Steve died in March. Donnie doesn't blame it on the storm, but their final months together would have been calmer, easier if the house wasn't in such disrepair. She's piecing things together as best she can and getting help from local charities. But without Steve's veteran's benefits and Social Security, things are precarious. Earlier this spring, a debt collector threatened to take the land. SPEIGHT: We've been here for 11 years. I was going to say we ain't left yet. I haven't left yet. HERSHER: And she hopes she doesn't have to leave. Meanwhile, the new hurricane season has already started. Forecasters expect more storms than usual. Rebecca Hersher, NPR News.

Farmers and ranchers, who need water for their crops and livestock, are getting hit hard. The dry weather isn't just threatening their bottom line, but their mental health, too. The effect of drought and climate change on people who work in agriculture has mental health care providers increasingly concerned. From member station KSJD in Cortez, Colo. , Lucas Brady Woods reports. (SOUNDBITE OF ENGINE RUNNING, CRICKETS CHIRPING)LUCAS BRADY WOODS, BYLINE: Mindy Perkovich has been a farmer for about 12 years. MINDY PERKOVICH: Every time I seed or plant a crop, there's, like, a certain amount of hope that goes with it. BRADY WOODS: Perkovich typically grows things like turnips, squash and tomatoes for the local market on seven acres. This season, though, she's had to cut her crops down to less than a single acre. PERKOVICH: We don't know if we're going to have water to keep that alive. So financially, I can't really even express how dramatic it's changed in the last couple years waterwise because without water, we can't grow crops; Without crops, we have nothing to sell to our consumers. BRADY WOODS: It doesn't typically rain much here, and last week her irrigation water was officially cut off for the season. Sacrifices like that can be really hard on farmers' mental health. PERKOVICH: When I walk outside of my house and I look to the west and most of our property is crispy and brown and dry, it makes me want to cry. I feel like you can feel it deep inside of you. I don't really have the words to explain it further. I don't know. It's really sad. BRADY WOODS: Farmers and ag workers have the second highest rate of suicide in the county where Perkovich farms, according to a state suicide prevention group called Celebrating Healthy Communities. And when that group looked at drought and suicide data together, they found the two spike in tandem. That tracks with research from Australia and India linking climate change to significantly higher suicide risk for farmers. J. C. Carrica, a rural behavioral health specialist in Colorado, isn't surprised by the findings here. J C CARRICA: There's seasonality. I think there's peaks of anxiety, peaks of depression. It's ever-flowing because it's, again, weather-related or market volatility. BRADY WOODS: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says rural communities already have nearly double the suicide rate as urban areas. And drought, Carrica says, is especially devastating for farmers. CARRICA: When you see the wind come through and shear off whatever little bit of grass you had from the quarter inch of rain a couple days prior, it's kind of the carrot and the stick, and sometimes there's just not enough carrot to keep people's hopes high. BRADY WOODS: Rural areas have fewer mental health and suicide prevention resources. Carrica says more effort needs to be made to get mental health care to farmers on their level. Dr. Richard McKeon, who oversees the National Suicide Prevention Resource Center, says it's not just a lack of services that's behind America's high rural suicide rate. RICHARD MCKEON: People in rural communities and in farming communities may be much more familiar with firearms than perhaps in some other, you know, communities. And that's really a crisis - could lead to a tragic event. While there are - you know, there are other methods of suicide attempts that are not nearly as lethal. BRADY WOODS: But McKeon also says it's important to understand that deaths by suicide are more complex than just one triggering event. Support from family and friends, for example, is just as important as professional mental health care. (SOUNDBITE OF ENGINE RUNNING, CRICKETS CHIRPING)BRADY WOODS: Back on Mindy Perkovich's farm, for the first time ever, she's had to lay off all of her employees because there's no water. And also for the first time, she sought out therapy. PERKOVICH: I was always really resistant to it. I was always really resistant to reaching out to a therapist. I was like, no, I can handle this; I don't need to have somebody else help me figure out my stuff. But I will say, it was incredibly helpful. BRADY WOODS: She says she's still holding on to hope for some rain. And until it comes, all she can do is keep planting and caring for whatever crops she can. For NPR News, I'm Lucas Brady Woods.

(SOUNDBITE OF KYLE RAPPS AND HEFNA GWAP SONG, \"HOLD TYTE\") ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:   Drought conditions across the West are the worst they've been in nearly two decades. Farmers and ranchers, who need water for their crops and livestock, are getting hit hard. The dry weather isn't just threatening their bottom line, but their mental health, too. The effect of drought and climate change on people who work in agriculture has mental health care providers increasingly concerned. From member station KSJD in Cortez, Colo. , Lucas Brady Woods reports. (SOUNDBITE OF ENGINE RUNNING, CRICKETS CHIRPING) LUCAS BRADY WOODS, BYLINE: Mindy Perkovich has been a farmer for about 12 years. MINDY PERKOVICH: Every time I seed or plant a crop, there's, like, a certain amount of hope that goes with it. BRADY WOODS: Perkovich typically grows things like turnips, squash and tomatoes for the local market on seven acres. This season, though, she's had to cut her crops down to less than a single acre. PERKOVICH: We don't know if we're going to have water to keep that alive. So financially, I can't really even express how dramatic it's changed in the last couple years waterwise because without water, we can't grow crops; Without crops, we have nothing to sell to our consumers. BRADY WOODS: It doesn't typically rain much here, and last week her irrigation water was officially cut off for the season. Sacrifices like that can be really hard on farmers' mental health. PERKOVICH: When I walk outside of my house and I look to the west and most of our property is crispy and brown and dry, it makes me want to cry. I feel like you can feel it deep inside of you. I don't really have the words to explain it further. I don't know. It's really sad.

The cybercriminals behind it are demanding that companies pay a ransom in order to get their computers and their data back. The attack is similar to the one that recently hit the world's biggest meat processor, raising concerns about the U. S. food supply. Some critics say industry consolidation has made those supply chains more vulnerable. NPR's Dan Charles has the story. DAN CHARLES, BYLINE: The company JBS is a giant in the meat industry, with operations around the globe. When hackers took some of its computers hostage a month ago, JBS shut down several processing plants in the U. S. and Australia and then paid the ransom of $11 million. But it downplayed the impact. The company says it lost less than a day's worth of production. Yet John Hoffman, a senior research fellow at the Food Protection and Defense Institute at the University of Minnesota, says it's had a longer-lasting effect on the thinking of some industry executives. JOHN HOFFMAN: People just didn't accept that it was that big a risk. I think that's changed today. I've already heard from folks in government. It's changed. People are looking at this, saying, OK, we've got to do something. CHARLES: Hoffman says many food companies are still using outdated computers that aren't secure, including in processing plants. He remembers visiting one plant - he won't say at which company - when he noticed a supervisor sitting at a computer on the factory floor, monitoring production. Hoffman could see that the operating system was very old - Windows 98. HOFFMAN: And I'm walking through with the manager of the plant and one of the officers of the company, and I said, gee, is any of this connected to the internet? And they said, oh, no, no, this isn't connect to the internet. CHARLES: Well, in fact, it was. So employees could log in from home, monitor that equipment, even shut it down or change the settings if they needed to. HOFFMAN: I mean, right there, I mean, that's the definition of vulnerability. CHARLES: And Hoffman says if those computers are vulnerable, so is the food itself. HOFFMAN: They're controlling valves and monitoring temperatures and controlling mixes of additives to food. These are part of food safety. CHARLES: Hoffman has been pushing for the government to enforce computer security standards in the food industry the same way it enforces food safety standards. He thinks the JBS attack is convincing more people that this would be a good idea. Other longtime critics of the meat industry, like Diana Moss, president of the American Antitrust Institute, are drawing an additional lesson from the attack. Moss says this industry is too concentrated in the hands of too few companies, so a problem in just one company can disrupt supplies for millions of consumers. DIANA MOSS: What we have in the meat supply chain in beef is a cartel. CHARLES: Just four companies, including JBS, slaughter about 85% of the country's fed cattle, those that are raised for beef. Their slaughterhouses are enormous. Moss says a small number of companies also dominate chicken production, flour milling, other kinds of food processing. MOSS: So when you only have a few firms in this critical midstream part of the supply chain - processing, manufacturing - the supply chain becomes very unstable. It lacks resiliency and is very subject to sort of shocks to the system. HOFFMAN: The North American Meat Institute, though, which represents meat producers like JBS, says recent events actually show that the existing system is already resilient. The cyberattack on JBS didn't cause much disruption, and the Meat Institute says its member companies reacted immediately to that attack and reviewed their own computer systems to make sure they were secure.

ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:  So next time you're out, try paying attention to something more - the rhythm of their flashes - because like the best dancers, some swarms have plenty of it. STEVEN STROGATZ: The phenomenon of fireflies in sync has been known for hundreds of years going back to the 1500s, when Sir Francis Drake and his crew were traveling around the world and they saw these spectacular displays of male fireflies on the river banks in Thailand and Malaysia gathered in mangrove trees all flashing in perfect unison all night long. KELLY: Steven Strogatz of Cornell - not a biologist but a mathematician. He came up with the first model to describe this phenomenon. STROGATZ: And mathematically, it's very mysterious because in math terms, we're studying an enormous system of interacting so-called oscillators - things that have a rhythm, that go through a cycle and, in this case, a cycle of flashing periodically. SHAPIRO: Physicists from the University of Colorado Boulder wanted to investigate some of the mystery behind that effect, so they packed their cameras and headed to the Smoky Mountains in June last year to see one particularly rhythmic species put on its show. ORIT PELEG: So it's flash, flash, flash, flash, flash and then quiet for a few seconds and then again flash, flash, flash. And the flash part is, again, in unison, where many fireflies flash together. KELLY: Orit Peleg and her colleagues filmed those fireflies flashing in sync night after night. Then they created a 3D reconstruction of that swarm and found that fireflies need to reach critical density before the rhythm kicks in. Here's Peleg's co-author Raphael Sarfati. RAPHAEL SARFATI: The flashes tend to move pretty rapidly but not instantly from one point of the swarm to another. So there's really a propagation effect very similar to a wave of flashing information. SHAPIRO: A relay, almost, where the fireflies sync themselves with those nearby, sending waves of light through the forest. PELEG: Where, you know, fireflies that are further away start flashing in bursts and then a little bit closer to you and a little bit closer to you. And then they pass by, and you can really experience this wave that's just beautiful. SHAPIRO: The study was published in Science Advances. KELLY: Now, this light show is so complex, it's brought together the fields of math, physics and biology. And though it's rare among American species, Sarfati recommends watching your nearby fireflies. SARFATI: And maybe you will notice something, you know, that is unexpected. Or maybe you feel like they are indeed on a dialogue sometimes and responding to one another. SHAPIRO: Who knows? You might just see something magical.

NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce did just that, and she returned with a story of a tiny creature, an ice worm whose very existence is hard to grasp. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE, BYLINE: Mount Rainier in Washington is the tallest peak in the Cascade Range. Fortunately, to see ice worms, you don't have to go to the very top. We're going to Paradise Glacier - over 7,000 feet up. From the trailhead, it is a long upward slog through snow. (SOUNDBITE OF SNOW CRUNCHING)GREENFIELDBOYCE: Scott Hotaling has made this trek many times. SCOTT HOTALING: Ice worms essentially changed my life from the first time I saw them. GREENFIELDBOYCE: He's a researcher with Washington State University and a kind of ice worm evangelist. HOTALING: I have no shame in promoting ice worms. GREENFIELDBOYCE: He says many people who spend lots of time on Mount Rainier and other Pacific Northwest mountains have never seen one or didn't understand what they were seeing. HOTALING: They're very obvious once you notice them. But it's so beyond your expectation when you're in a glacier environment that there will be worms. GREENFIELDBOYCE: The worms only venture out onto the surface of a glacier at certain times, like late summer afternoons. Hotaling says these worms are the most abundant beast that lives up high on these mountains, at least when it comes to animals you can see with your eyes. (SOUNDBITE OF SNOW CRUNCHING)GREENFIELDBOYCE: Trudging along beside us is Peter Wimberger from the University of Puget Sound. He got interested in ice worms about 15 years ago when a student said he wanted to study them. Wimberger thought the guy was pulling his leg, that it was a prank. PETER WIMBERGER: And he realized I didn't believe him. And all of a sudden he pulled out this little, small stack of papers, and he said, damn it, they're real. GREENFIELDBOYCE: It was a small stack of scientific papers because hardly anyone has studied them. After some more hiking, Hotaling bends down and scoops up some snow. HOTALING: Here's an ice worm. GREENFIELDBOYCE: I would never have guessed that was a worm. HOTALING: Yeah. Eventually, you get good at spotting them. GREENFIELDBOYCE: It looks like a moving piece of thread, about an inch long, thin and jet black. It's wet, and its dark body sort of shimmers and glistens as it writhes in between ice crystals, going pretty intently and gracefully. Hotaling says finding one on the surface is a good sign. HOTALING: That suggests to me that they're starting to come up. GREENFIELDBOYCE: We keep going, ever higher. The sky is bright blue. We see other snow-topped peaks in the distance - Mt. Adams, Mt. Hood, Mount St. Helens. When we stop for breaks, I ask questions about ice worms; the answer is almost always the same - no one knows. Hotaling guesses they can live under 30 feet or more of snow, down where seasonal snow meets the older snow of the glacier. They may not need much to survive. HOTALING: I've kept them in my fridge in my home for physiology experiments for a year or more without adding anything to their system, and they're fine. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Winters here are brutal, but that may be when living is easy for ice worms because when they come out onto the glacier surface at the start of summer, they're actually fatter than they are at the end of the summer season. They're thought to eat algae and bacteria. But, again, who knows? And here's the most surprising thing about ice worms, which, after all, have ice in their name. HOTALING: They can't handle even the slightest bit of freezing. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Hotaling says the worms live at 32 degrees Fahrenheit, but lab tests he and a colleague did show that if temperatures dip even slightly below that, like just one degree, the worms die. Meanwhile, other tests show that the worms shrug off shockingly high levels of harsh ultraviolet light, which is a good thing for them because the sun up here is intense. HOTALING: And I actually think they are coming looking for the sun a bit because they want to have some of that heat energy to drive their biochemical reactions. GREENFIELDBOYCE: We cross over a ridge and onto Paradise Glacier. HOTALING: Did you see them? It's happening. And so now you can start to see - like, you can just look out a little further, and you can sort of see them just dotting. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Thousands and thousands of ice worms have appeared. As we watch, their numbers rapidly grow and grow until there's dark flecks everywhere on the snow. HOTALING: There's no hint of them trying to blend into their surroundings. GREENFIELDBOYCE: You don't want to step on them, but it's impossible not to. Hotaling thinks these worms must have some kind of impact on the world around them because a single glacier is estimated to hold more than 5 billion. HOTALING: There are so many. Like, from where we're standing right now, I can see five, six, 10 glaciers, and if every one hosts that density of ice worms, like, that is just a massive amount of biomass that's in a place that is generally biomass poor. (SOUNDBITE OF DIGGING IN SNOW)GREENFIELDBOYCE: A grad student named Jordan Boersma shovel snow from some rocks and sets up a wildlife camera. It's one of several the researchers are putting up here to understand to what degree wildlife uses these glaciers. Already they've spotted birds like ravens and rosy finches chowing down on ice worms. The worms could be a critical food resource for some species. Hotaling points out that climate change is making glaciers like this one melt. This habitat is rapidly changing. HOTALING: What goes away when a mountain glacier is lost? I don't think we have any real answer to that question. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Ice worms might even speed a glacier's melting. Their bodies darken the glacier's surface, potentially making it absorb more heat. Hotaling thinks this is worth investigating. He says when it comes to ice worms, there are more mysteries than answers. HOTALING: Ice worms are an extraordinary example of a bit of biodiversity on our planet that most people don't know about. And in this case of, like, Seattle and the Northwest, it's in the backyard of millions of people. GREENFIELDBOYCE: And when they look at snow-capped peaks like Mt. Rainier, most don't realize they're gazing at the realm of the ice worm. Nell Greenfieldboyce, NPR News.

They published a letter in the journal Science saying the lab leak theory needed to be taken seriously. Now, that theory proposes the virus came from a lab in Wuhan rather than from an infected animal. After the letter came out, President Biden ordered the U. S. intelligence community to double down on efforts to trace the pandemic's origins. Now one scientist who co-authored that letter has backed away from the lab leak theory. NPR's Michaeleen Doucleff explains why. MICHAELEEN DOUCLEFF, BYLINE: In the past decade, Michael Worobey has become a bit like the Sherlock Holmes of pandemic origins. His work has helped to explain how the 1918 flu emerged and how HIV came to the U. S. earlier than people thought. MICHAEL WOROBEY: It got to New York City pretty darn early, probably around 1970, 1971, somewhere in there. DOUCLEFF: Worobey is an evolutionary biologist at the University of Arizona. A few months ago, he thought that the lab leak theory seemed just as plausible as the alternative, that the virus jumped directly from an animal into people. WOROBEY: So I was on that Science letter asserting that more investigation is needed of both possibilities. DOUCLEFF: Worobey has been modeling how the virus spreads around a city. Recently, two pieces of information jumped out at him. First, he plotted on a map the earliest known cases of COVID-19. WOROBEY: If you open up Figure 1 of this paper that I just sent. . . DOUCLEFF: On the map, there's a red dot where each early case lived in December 2019. The data come from the World Health Organization, but that data were missing two key elements - the location of the Huanan Seafood Market and the Wuhan Institute of Virology, where scientists studied bat coronaviruses. So Worobey added them to the map. WOROBEY: It's a very simple thing to do, but it really paints a pretty clear picture, right? DOUCLEFF: The dots show cases starting right near the Huanan Seafood Market and radiating out from there. WOROBEY: The Huanan Market seems like the bullseye of this outbreak. It's quite extraordinary. DOUCLEFF: And what about near the Wuhan Institute of Virology, or WIV? WOROBEY: And there's nothing around the WIV. DOUCLEFF: Given how contagious the virus is and that cases likely doubled every two to three days, Worobey would have expected infections near the lab if the virus started there. WOROBEY: The bottom line is, it would be odd for it not to be spreading from there rather than from elsewhere. DOUCLEFF: The other piece of data concerns what was being sold at the seafood market, what could have spread the virus. Gigi Gronvall is a biosecurities expert at Johns Hopkins University. She says the Chinese government have always claimed there were no illegal wildlife at that market. GIGI GRONVALL: That market was operating completely legally. And it's like, OK. That is - you know, that's just on the face of it. You just know that that's not correct. DOUCLEFF: Lo and behold, last month, researchers in China published a study showing the Huanan Seafood Market was one of four markets in Wuhan selling illegal wildlife, including two animals known to spread SARS coronaviruses - civets and raccoon dogs. GRONVALL: They have pictures and notes and how much they cost, including the market in question, where some of these early cases were. And their work went to November of 2019. DOUCLEFF: Gronvall says all this data don't prove an animal origin for the pandemic or disprove the lab leak theory. GRONVALL: There are lots of pieces to still fill in, you know, but this report ties a lot of the pieces together that say that there is a really credible story for an animal origin to SARS-CoV-2. DOUCLEFF: And Worobey agrees. Given the data available now, he thinks the most likely scenario is that the pandemic started in the Huanan Seafood Market. WOROBEY: I do think the cross-species transmission without a lab escape is the most likely scenario by a long shot. DOUCLEFF: But if new information comes out, he says, his thinking could shift again because that's how science works. Michaeleen Doucleff, NPR News.

They will spend the next two weeks summarizing how the Earth's climate has changed and what the future might look like. It's happening at the same time many parts of the world are being gripped by extreme weather linked to climate change, from flash floods in Europe and Asia to lethal heat waves in Africa and North America. NPR's Rebecca Hersher is here to talk more about it. Hey, Rebecca. REBECCA HERSHER, BYLINE: Hey. MCCAMMON: What is the goal of this meeting? HERSHER: So these scientists are serving on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and that's part of the United Nations, and they're finalizing this really important report. So they've been poring over all the climate research published through January of this year - so that's thousands of studies about Earth's atmosphere, its oceans, its forests, its weather patterns. And their goal is to summarize all that research into one report that governments can use to understand two things - one, the scientific consensus about how the climate has already changed; and what the rest of the century will look like. You know, how quickly is the Earth heating up? What does that mean for hurricanes and fires, for sea level rise, for droughts? MCCAMMON: Some really big, really important questions. Now, this isn't the first time these scientists have met like this, but it's been a while, right? HERSHER: Yeah, exactly. So this is the sixth edition of this report. The last edition came out in 2013, which is an eternity in the world of climate science because global warming is accelerating, and advances in climate modeling and other climate research are also accelerating, you know, trying to keep up with the urgency of the moment and make sure humans have the knowledge they need to tackle this problem. So this report, the sixth edition, it will be a crucial document. The authors hope that it will inform, basically, the next decade of climate policy - things like how quickly we reduce greenhouse gas emissions. MCCAMMON: How does a scientific report like this one help governments actually make big decisions? I mean, will the scientists explicitly tell world leaders what they should do when it comes to public policy? HERSHER: No. So that is the tricky part - the scientists won't make recommendations about specific policies. Like, you won't see a bullet point in this report that says stop burning coal right now, even though that would obviously reduce greenhouse gases. And that's because the scientists - the role of scientists is to make sure that governments understand how policies like burning coal are affecting the Earth, and then it's up to governments to lead humanity through this energy transition. MCCAMMON: So, Rebecca, how do scientists help governments do that exactly? HERSHER: So in this report, they're using five scenarios. They're kind of, like, imaginary policy worlds. For example, there's a scenario where countries around the world work together to develop cheap, low-carbon technologies, and then they make them available to everyone. But then there's another scenario where nationalism surges and governments kind of turn inward and really focus on local energy options. And it's important to say, under most of these scenarios, it is still possible to keep global warming below the 2-degree Celsius threshold. That's what the Paris agreement is aiming for. It's just a matter of how. MCCAMMON: So these scientists are synthesizing a lot of complex information. How long will it take for them to release their big report? HERSHER: So they've already been working on it for years, is the good news. So it's in pretty good shape. There are already 12 chapters. They're drafts. And they just need to hash out the final draft. That will take about two weeks. Usually it only takes one week, but the scientists are doing this meeting virtually, so it'll take a lot longer. And at the end of those two weeks, on August 9, they will release this report to the public. So stay tuned. MCCAMMON: We certainly will. That's NPR's Rebecca Hersher from the climate team.

A historic drought and heat wave have primed forests to burn big this year, just like they did last year. Climate change is playing a role. And joining us now to talk about it is Nick Mott, the editor of Montana Public Radio's podcast called \"Fireline,\" which takes a deep dive into humans' relationship with fire. Welcome, Nick. NICK MOTT, BYLINE: Thanks for having me. MCCAMMON: First off, how is the fire situation there in Montana right now? MOTT: Where I am, about an hour north of Yellowstone National Park, we've had smoky skies for weeks now, and we're still in the middle of some really extreme drought and heat. Today is supposed to be over 100 degrees. It seems like everybody's a little bit on edge about what this all could mean for the rest of the season. MCCAMMON: Yeah, especially after the year that the West had last year. And speaking of the West, what about the rest of the region? How does Montana compare to other Western states? MOTT: So far at least, I'd say we're pretty lucky here. The bootleg fire in Oregon, for example, is over 400,000 acres. It's so big and so hot it's generating its own weather, meaning it's creating these clouds that can cause wind and lightning that can make the fire grow even bigger. MCCAMMON: More than 400,000 acres is huge. That's twice the size of New York City. So put that in context. Have these wildfires been getting larger over the years? MOTT: By just about every measure, yes, they have. But the first thing to keep in mind is that fire itself is normal. Lots of forests need fire. Before Europeans got here, there was lots of natural fire in North America, and Indigenous people also set fires to manage the landscape they lived on. It helps open up the land. It can rejuvenate growth. Some species of animals thrive after burns. For the podcast, we talked with Tony Incashola Jr. , who's head of forestry with the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes in northwest Montana. Lots of tribes like Incashola's are working to bring fire back to the landscape. TONY INCASHOLA JR: It's not only a gift to us, but it's more of a gift to the land. MCCAMMON: So would you say that the huge fires like the one in Oregon right now - is that normal? MOTT: Not necessarily. One reason we're seeing them is because fire season is now 2 1/2 months longer than it was in the 1970s, according to U. S. Forest Service estimate that some think is pretty conservative. And if we look at the statistics, the nine years with the most acres burned since we started keeping track have all been since 2005. So, yeah, we're seeing bigger, hotter fires, and some folks are calling it a fire year, not even a fire season anymore. MCCAMMON: Wow. Nick, I want to ask you the question we're asking about so many extreme weather events these days, which is to what extent are these big fires due to climate change? MOTT: People who study the natural world say to a really large extent. I talked with Cathy Whitlock, who's a paleoecologist at Montana State University. CATHY WHITLOCK: I would say 95% of it's climate-driven. MOTT: That 95% number is definitely the subject of lots of debate. She thinks it's the right number because she's been looking back at thousands of years of climate history. MCCAMMON: OK, thousands of years - how do you do that? How is that possible? MOTT: Well, she actually goes out on lakes and then drills way down into the mud at their bottoms and pulls out these long core samples, because when wildfires burn, they deposit ash and charcoal on the tops of these lakes, which settles down and into that mud. So those cores contain records of wildfires going back thousands of years. She says the record shows that there's always more fire when the climate's warmer. WHITLOCK: When you have warmer winters, you have less snowpack. Snow turns to rain earlier in the year. The snowpack that you get melts off faster. And so you're left with less water in your high elevations as you go into summer. MOTT: Another researcher who looks at those lake mud samples is Phil Higuera, a professor of fire ecology at the University of Montana. And he just published a paper with the title \"Rocky Mountain Subalpine Forests Now Burning More Than Any Time In Recent Millennia. \"MOTT: For most of my career, when we look at the past, it kind of in a comforting way - we see that, oh, these things that are unusual in the human time scale - they've happened before. But this paper was different. MCCAMMON: Different how? MOTT: Because like I said earlier, fire has always been a natural part of forest life cycles. So if we look back and see evidence of a similar rate of big fires throughout history, maybe what we're seeing now is normal. But his new paper shows that human-influenced climate change is altering our ecosystems in ways that are totally new and really, really fast. Something else to point out is that sometimes the climate is changing so drastically after a fire burns, the same type of forest doesn't grow back in its place. The landscape is literally changing in the wake of the flames. Higuera says these big ecosystem-level changes are really starting to hit home for him. PHIL HIGUERA: And what I've realized is that while I've spent 20 years thinking about how ecosystems would respond to climate change and how fire regimes would respond to climate change, I have not thought about what that would feel like to witness. That has been surprising and a little bit jolting, for sure. MCCAMMON: And Nick, does that line up with what you are hearing from other scientists who study this kind of thing? MOTT: Oh, absolutely. Andrew Larson, who also teaches forest ecology at the University of Montana, told us about a fire outside the city where he lives a few years ago that just choked the area with smoke for weeks. ANDREW LARSON: I mean, it was almost traumatic. I don't want to use that word lightly, but I mean, it - God, it was brutal. MOTT: He said it was so bad he found himself personally reverting to what he considers an unscientific way of thinking about fire - that it's bad and that it always needs to be eliminated. He spends a lot of time trying to educate the public on how some fire is actually really beneficial and even essential for forests. He says, as a culture, it's really, really hard to get hold of that idea. LARSON: Sometimes it makes me feel a little bit - I don't know - like, am I making any difference here with the science (laughter)? That's what I wonder sometimes. MCCAMMON: It all sounds a little grim. How do ecologists like Andrew Larson want their science to make a difference? I mean, what's the lesson that they want land managers and policymakers and members of the public to take away? MOTT: Well, I'll let him talk about this. Here's how he put it in our podcast. LARSON: Fire is an inevitable part of this landscape. It's just we live in a flammable place, and we have to get past the promise that forestry made the world years and years ago, that we could control fire and put it out and regulate the forest in that way. What we can do is say, yes, we live in a smoky, flammable environment. How do we deal with that? MOTT: He means things like getting indoor air filters to make sure we're staying healthy when our cities are full of smoke or getting rid of the flammable stuff on and around our homes to make our communities more resilient or even trying to reverse the trend of more and more development in forests and fire-prone landscapes. But like Larson says, it's hard to see that bigger picture and embrace good fire when we're totally socked in with smoke or flames are approaching a community. MCCAMMON: Well, thank you so much, Nick. MOTT: Thank you.

Something else to point out is that sometimes the climate is changing so drastically after a fire burns, the same type of forest doesn't grow back in its place. The landscape is literally changing in the wake of the flames. Higuera says these big ecosystem-level changes are really starting to hit home for him. PHIL HIGUERA: And what I've realized is that while I've spent 20 years thinking about how ecosystems would respond to climate change and how fire regimes would respond to climate change, I have not thought about what that would feel like to witness. That has been surprising and a little bit jolting, for sure. MCCAMMON: And Nick, does that line up with what you are hearing from other scientists who study this kind of thing? MOTT: Oh, absolutely. Andrew Larson, who also teaches forest ecology at the University of Montana, told us about a fire outside the city where he lives a few years ago that just choked the area with smoke for weeks. ANDREW LARSON: I mean, it was almost traumatic. I don't want to use that word lightly, but I mean, it - God, it was brutal. MOTT: He said it was so bad he found himself personally reverting to what he considers an unscientific way of thinking about fire - that it's bad and that it always needs to be eliminated. He spends a lot of time trying to educate the public on how some fire is actually really beneficial and even essential for forests. He says, as a culture, it's really, really hard to get hold of that idea. LARSON: Sometimes it makes me feel a little bit - I don't know - like, am I making any difference here with the science (laughter)? That's what I wonder sometimes. MCCAMMON: It all sounds a little grim. How do ecologists like Andrew Larson want their science to make a difference? I mean, what's the lesson that they want land managers and policymakers and members of the public to take away? MOTT: Well, I'll let him talk about this. Here's how he put it in our podcast. LARSON: Fire is an inevitable part of this landscape. It's just we live in a flammable place, and we have to get past the promise that forestry made the world years and years ago, that we could control fire and put it out and regulate the forest in that way. What we can do is say, yes, we live in a smoky, flammable environment. How do we deal with that? MOTT: He means things like getting indoor air filters to make sure we're staying healthy when our cities are full of smoke or getting rid of the flammable stuff on and around our homes to make our communities more resilient or even trying to reverse the trend of more and more development in forests and fire-prone landscapes. But like Larson says, it's hard to see that bigger picture and embrace good fire when we're totally socked in with smoke or flames are approaching a community. MCCAMMON: Well, thank you so much, Nick. MOTT: Thank you.

It could also have up to 24 armed. Now, the species used to be common off the west coast of the United States. I stress used to be because in recent years, it's nearly disappeared, the victim of a deadly wasting disease. NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce went to an island off the coast of Washington to see how researchers are trying to save it. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE, BYLINE: Jason Hodin hauls up a rope that's hanging off a dock into the water. At the end is a square, Tupperware container, the kind you might use for a sandwich. This one has holes cut into the sides that are covered with a fine mesh to let water flow through. Hodin pulls off the lid. And we peer inside. There's some crushed shells and some tiny, reddish-orange dots. JASON HODIN: Like that guy right there. See that little dot right there in front of my finger? That's a juvenile sea star. He's about a month old. GREENFIELDBOYCE: It's the size of a poppy seed. Baby sunflower sea stars like this one are what Hodin and his colleagues are figuring out how to raise here on San Juan Island in the Pacific Northwest at the University of Washington's Friday Harbor Labs. In the wild, sunflower sea stars are being wiped out. For example, Hodin says, in California. . . HODIN: Sunflower stars are more than 95% gone. Some people think that they're entirely extinct in the wild down there. I've heard scattered reports of people maybe seeing a few. GREENFIELDBOYCE: The culprit is a mysterious wasting disease. No one knows what causes it. Since 2013, it's been hitting a bunch of sea star species hard on both the West and the East Coast. Hodin says the sick sea stars are horrible to behold. HODIN: They really do kind of, like, dissolve into a pile of goo. GREENFIELDBOYCE: And sunflower sea stars seem to be the most affected. So in 2019, the Nature Conservancy approached Hodin about setting up a program to breed this species in captivity with a goal of someday reintroducing it into locations where it's disappeared. He and his colleagues first took some sunflower sea stars from the wild. About 30 of these giants now live at the lab in burbling outdoor tanks. Researchers like Fleur Anteau recognized them as individuals. FLEUR ANTEAU: This here's Deep Blue, and she's our biggest. GREENFIELDBOYCE: A lot of their names are linked to their colors. Like Prince has arms with tips that are purple. These sea stars can be orange, pink, green. The colors are so bright, they almost glow like the creatures are lit from within. ANTEAU: So some of them, when, you know, I open the cage, will start moving their arms to the surface, like Olga here. And some of them are a little shier. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Even the shy ones suddenly come to life as she tucks tasty mussels under their arms. They hunch over the prey so they can swallow it whole. ANTEAU: When food comes, then you really see the predator come out. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Sunflower sea stars are predators, voracious ones. They normally crawl along the sea floor and gobble up sea urchins, keeping their populations in check and helping to protect kelp forests. This lab has figured out how to get sperm and eggs from the wild caught adults and grow up their offspring in the lab. The oldest they've produced are nearly a year and a half. They're about three inches across. HODIN: We're assuming that by next year, they might be reproductive. Based on ones that we've seen in the field, the smaller ones that we know are reproductively mature. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Hodin's lab is working to produce hundreds of young sunflower sea stars like these. He says, these could first be tested in local waters, where their parents came from, to see how well they fare in the wild. Then someday, maybe they could go into places where sea star populations have vanished. But the danger may still be out there. DREW HARVELL: I would say at the outset that it's critical to understand more about what's killing them before trying to put them back. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Drew Harvell is a research scientist at Friday Harbor Labs and professor emeritus at Cornell University. She thinks the cause could be an infectious agent. Other scientists blame warming ocean waters or other environmental changes. HARVELL: It is extremely controversial. There is not agreement. GREENFIELDBOYCE: She's starting new lab experiments this month to test the idea that it's infectious. Extracts from six sea stars will be injected into seemingly healthy ones. She'll be using sunflower sea stars since they're so susceptible. Meanwhile, at Hodin's lab, he's constantly on the lookout for any signs that his beloved animals are falling ill. I watch him use a pair of tweezers to tenderly feed a tiny mussel to one of the young ones. It curls its arm around the treat. HODIN: They're our foster kids. And we're responsible for them. We take a lot of care in trying to make sure that they stay alive. GREENFIELDBOYCE: He says he even dreams about them. The night before, he dreamed of being surrounded by water in a house-sized version of one of their tanks. Nell Greenfieldboyce, NPR News.

N. 's Panel on Climate Change will release its most comprehensive report to date on global warming. But we don't need to wait to feel the effects of climate change. Between record-breaking heat, storms and droughts, Americans are already dealing with the immediate and alarming consequences of a warming planet. And that is changing what it means to be a meteorologist. They've always been the people we count on to keep us safe. But increasingly, they're also charged with guiding us through the messy, scary, highly politicized science around climate change. We wanted to get a view from inside this storm, so to speak, so we've turned to meteorologist Matthew Cappucci. He is the weather guy at the Fox 5 station here in D. C. and a contributor to member station WAMU and The Washington Post. Welcome to the program. MATTHEW CAPPUCCI: Hi. Thanks so much for having me. MCCAMMON: So, Matthew, as we mentioned, this has already been a record-breaking summer on many levels. Now we're getting predictions that we are heading into an above-average hurricane season with up to 21 major storms. Can you put this into context for us, and especially, what's your sense of how much climate change is an issue here? CAPPUCCI: I think the biggest thing we need to remember when we talk climate change is that an increase in air temperature reflects an increase in the air's ability to hold water. And that's the biggest player when it comes to the effects that we feel in terms of the weather. So out west in California, for example, we're talking record heat and record fires. Out there, there's not much moisture. So a warming world will actually suck moisture out of the ground, make it drier, make it hotter and lead to more wildfires. On the East Coast, where there is moisture - near the Gulf of Mexico, for example - that means more moisture in the air for these hurricanes to work with. And so you can have the same effect, the same warming temperatures lead to drought in one area and increased flooding in another area. So it really is significant in how the warming world is affecting us and ultimately comes down to precipitation extremes. That's the biggie. MCCAMMON: Of course, your job as a weather guy, so to speak, is to talk about local forecasts. How well do you think audiences understand the way that what is happening locally is tied to these larger global trends? CAPPUCCI: I think context is everything. I did a story a couple of years ago on Houston. You know, there are a lot of folks in Houston who have differing opinions on climate change. But here's the thing. In Houston, the increase in air temperature has led to about a 10 to 15% increase in annual precipitation. Now they have about six to eight inches more of rainfall each year than they did back in 1970, which is the equivalent of about 45 extra days of precipitation every single year. And so suddenly, someone who might have been kind of hesitant as to how a big global weather pattern could affect them suddenly has a way to think, hey, I've seen flooding in Houston before. It's made more likely thanks to climate change. And so it becomes much more real to them. So it really depends where I'm forecasting, with whom I'm communicating. But trying to get the effects on a local level to show them how it's actually affecting their daily life is really the biggest hurdle. MCCAMMON: Do you think that your profession, local meteorologists, are doing enough to help explain why what's happening locally is happening? CAPPUCCI: I don't, to be honest. And I think part of it is that in many regions of the country, people are tied down based on sort of the political climate around climate change. I think that there are meteorologists who are starting to latch on to really communicating climate change. And there are many great organizations out there like Climate Central, for example, that gives us as broadcast meteorologists statistics and graphics that we can use on air. I think that's vitally important because a television meteorologist is usually the only degreed scientist that a member of the public interacts with on a daily basis. And so if we can be that trusted messenger who is conversing with somebody every day in their living room, then we can have that conversation in a way that they might be more receptive to than hearing it from other sources. MCCAMMON: I want to ask you a question, Matthew, that is admittedly a little bit outside your wheelhouse. But as you're talking about politicization of science, I think, of course, about COVID-19 and the science around COVID and the vaccines. And of course, that's a different issue from climate change, but I think one thread that's similar is a distrust in science, a distrust in institutions and a lot of misinformation that is sort of muddying the waters and making it hard for policymakers to take action that's really urgent. As you've watched that unfold, based on what you do and your job as someone whose job it is to look at science and communicate it to the public in a very understandable way, is there anything that you see and go, I'd do that differently? CAPPUCCI: I think the biggest thing is trying to make people feel smart. And I think so often, we see people who are trying to teach science, who are trying to get really important information out to the public, either completely unable to communicate science to begin with and talk in, you know, a PhD level or sort of babying the audience and really not giving them credit. And that kind of turns off the audience no matter how you slice it. I want to engage in an educated conversation with the audience, figure out where they are, teach them something new. And once you make somebody feel like they know a little bit, they're much more interested in paying attention to learn a little bit more. MCCAMMON: Climate change is obviously a heavy subject, but I'm wondering what makes you excited about weather. What made you want to go into this field? CAPPUCCI: I love the fact that every day I can do what I love. I can look up at the sky, see something amazing, and no two days are the same. There's always something new that I'm learning, something new that I'm seeing, something new that I'm getting to witness. And I've seen things in my short 23 years most people wouldn't ever imagine getting to see. I flew beneath the Northern Lights early this year. I skydived. I chased seven tornadoes. I've gotten softball-sized hail. I've seen multiple total solar eclipses. And I love the fact that no matter how good I get at forecasting, there will be surprises. There will be something new. And I think that's one of the biggest messages here, is that it's really amazing out there. If people would put down the phones, occasionally look up, I think they'd be really amazed by what they saw. And I think it's important to remember, too, that we all share the same sky. And that's kind of the bottom line of this. MCCAMMON: That was Matthew Cappucci, meteorologist for The Washington Post and member station WAMU. Thanks so much for your time. CAPPUCCI: Thank you.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #1: Despite the efforts of thousands of firefighters, California's wildfires have turned hundreds of homes to rubble and ash. CORNISH: That fire in northern California is why, at one point over the weekend, the city with the worst air quality of any in the world was Denver.

CORNISH: Meanwhile, in Nebraska. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #3: A group of friends rescued from a flooded elevator during the overwhelming flash floods this weekend. CORNISH: A few people had to be pulled from neck-deep water in an elevator in downtown Omaha, where homes and businesses were flooded after a torrential rain on Saturday. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #4: Streets completely unrecognizable as cars were floating down lanes and people were left stranded. CORNISH: Now, on any given day, you can find stories like this from all over the world. And they're becoming more frequent. That's one major takeaway from a new landmark report issued by the U. N. on Monday. It found human-caused climate change is leading to more and more extreme weather events. And it's accelerating faster than we thought. ALLISON CRIMMINS: Those are the things that people in the U. S. are already observing in their own backyards - wildfires in the West, the flooding that we see in the Midwest and the Northeast, the damage from hurricanes in the South. CORNISH: Allison Crimmins is the director of the National Climate Assessment at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. She spoke to NPR Monday about the new U. N. report. CRIMMINS: The overall message is that, you know, climate change isn't something that's happening far away to someone else in some far-off future time. It's really happening here and now. CORNISH: CONSIDER THIS - we knew climate change was happening. Now we have new information about how fast. And each day, the consequences are becoming clearer. From NPR, I'm Audie Cornish. It's Monday, August 9. It's CONSIDER THIS FROM NPR. The secretary general of the U. N. called this week's new report a code red for humanity. The report's authors, nearly 200 leading climate scientists, say the world is running out of time to prevent catastrophic global warming this century. One of the scientists is Amanda Maycock. AMANDA MAYCOCK: We can now link more concretely many of the extreme events that we're observing around the world - so extreme heat wave events, extreme rainfall events - to the warming that's occurred and to human-induced climate change. CORNISH: Maycock directs the Climate Institute at the University of Leeds and was also one of the authors of the new report. And that report is the work of the U. N. 's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a hugely influential group that defines scientific consensus. And that paper we're talking about today - well, it's part of their first big report in eight years, aggregated findings from 14,000 pages of scientific studies. MAYCOCK: Yeah, that's a really important statistic - is that we've assessed a huge body of literature here to come up with the findings that are presented in the report. CORNISH: Speaking to NPR on Monday, Maycock outlined key takeaways. She said human influence on extreme weather events has increased in recent years. She said scientists have gotten better and more confident about linking specific weather events to climate change. And she said it now looks like the global temperature will increase by a crucial benchmark of 1. 5 degrees Celsius sooner than previously thought. MAYCOCK: Now, what we show in this report published today is that in a number of different scenarios for possible future emissions trajectories that we could take as a planet, the 1. 5 degree Celsius temperature target is likely to be reached or exceeded in the next 20 years. CORNISH: One point five degrees Celsius is an important number. It's the target scientists say we need to stay under to avoid most catastrophic and long-term effects of climate change. And those include massive flooding, severe drought and runaway ocean warming that fuels tropical storms and drives mass die-offs of marine species. Maycock said even if we reach that 1. 5-degree threshold, it's not impossible to turn things around. MAYCOCK: But in order to do that would require very rapid, large-scale reductions, reaching this target of net-zero emissions by around the middle of the century. CORNISH: Net-zero emissions in the next 30 years - well, the world is not on pace to do that. While the Biden administration has promised to cut emissions in half this decade, it's unclear how they will achieve that goal. And other major carbon emitters, China, India - well, they're not on track to reduce their emissions this decade. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)CORNISH: As the planet continues to warm, more and more people and governments will be forced to confront weather extremes that they're not prepared for. This past week, it happened in the Mediterranean, where thousands of people had to be evacuated from a Greek island by boat after a wildfire cut off other means of escape. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: (Non-English language spoken). CORNISH: And the footage looks downright apocalyptic. It's night. It's dark. The boat is surrounded by a coast of bright, flaming forest on three sides. Italy, Lebanon and Turkey are also dealing with wildfires amid a record heat wave. And in some of Turkey's coastal forests, people have been left to fight fires on their own. Durrie Bouscaren reports from Istanbul. DURRIE BOUSCAREN, BYLINE: When Engin Basol and his neighbors saw smoke rising behind their village, they rushed to the forest. ENGIN BASOL: Everybody understood that if they cannot stop it, it's going to connect with the big fire in Mazi village. BOUSCAREN: It was still small, so Basol started cutting down fresh olive branches to try and smother the fire. Instead, he says, the flames exploded to the size of a large house. BASOL: It got to the size of the villa in, like, 10 seconds or 15 seconds, you know what I mean? BOUSCAREN: They used tractors to pull in the water tanks that are usually used in their gardens. After a half hour, Basol and 250 volunteers were able to save Etrim, a small mountain town known for its traditional carpets. But all around them are the blackened hillsides of the Turkish Riviera, once a global tourist draw, now a desolate landscape. Turkish social media is full of images of residents fighting fires on their own, taking care of injured wildlife and sleeping in the open, all against a smoke-filled sky. (SOUNDBITE OF PEOPLE SHOUTING, FLAMES ROARING)BOUSCAREN: In this video by photographer Mustafa Seven, volunteers in surgical masks try to stop a fire from overtaking a mountain road with a single hose. Over a week of high winds and temperatures above 100 degrees Fahrenheit, the fires quickly became the worst in Turkey's recorded history. In just 10 days, they burned an area three times the size of what typically burns in an average year, and the damage keeps growing. As climate change lengthens droughts and pushes temperatures even higher, these disasters are likely to become more and more common. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT RECEP TAYYIP ERDOGAN: (Speaking Turkish). BOUSCAREN: Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's government has pledged assistance and rebuilding efforts for those affected by the fire. Some are now living in camps. But the government's lack of preparedness, despite fires being a common problem in the south, has stoked anger, explains Sinem Adar, a Turkish political expert at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs. SINEM ADAR: It's like the disrespect of the current government towards its own citizens has become very apparent. BOUSCAREN: In recent years, Erdogan's government has cut funding from the agency in charge of firefighting planes, leaving none to respond when the fires broke out. Then, Adar says, officials seemed not to know who was responsible for what, leaving local governments to largely fend for themselves. ADAR: In general, it's an indication of the inability of Erdogan's government to govern the country. BOUSCAREN: Erdogan's political opponents are seizing the moment. Kemal Kilicdaroglu, the leader of Turkey's main opposition party, accused the ruling party of incompetence. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)KEMAL KILICDAROGLU: (Speaking Turkish). BOUSCAREN: \"You cannot run this country,\" he says. CORNISH: Durrie Bouscaren reporting for NPR from Istanbul. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)CORNISH: Fires and floods are devastating catastrophes that make themselves felt all at once. For many other people, the real-world effects of climate change are creeping into their lives in smaller, slower ways. It's like smoke under a door. Here's NPR's Jeff Brady on what that's looked like in America this summer. JEFF BRADY, BYLINE: For graduate student A. Carey, summer means traveling from Maryland to the Bahamas to see family for Emancipation Day. The holiday celebrates the end of slavery and includes music, dancing and a parade. A CAREY: You just hear this, like, thumping drumbeat, like a heartbeat. Coming out of the distance, you hear this, you know, gradual, like, brass swelling. (SOUNDBITE OF YOUTUBE VIDEO)BRADY: Carey says this video from YouTube is exactly as she remembers the parades. She says saving for and planning this trip each summer is a tradition that's changing. CAREY: You know, I have to be a lot more aware about when I travel. I have to think about trip insurance. What's my Plan B, Plan C of returning to the U. S. if it is hit by a hurricane? BRADY: And Carey says there's a lot more talk in the Bahamas about rising water levels and what that will mean for the future. In Tampa, Fla. , Sara Brogan says summers are getting hotter. Going to the beach to cool off is a decades-long tradition for her family. SARA BROGAN: We've been to the beach once this summer. BRADY: That's because of red tide. These algae blooms are increasing, likely because of human pollution and warming temperatures. They produce toxins that kill sea life, which is why Brogan is staying away from the beach. BROGAN: A lot of times, it's - before you even get there, you can smell - the smell of the dead fish is very strong. BRADY: Health officials say people with breathing problems like asthma should stay clear of red tide areas. Brogan, a registered nurse, says her family doesn't have chronic breathing issues, but it's still uncomfortable. BROGAN: For us, it would be like, you know, just a tickle in the throat, or else, then, you know, you're having to, like, clear your throat more, or you cough a little bit. BRADY: Brogan canceled plans to rent a pontoon boat for Father's Day to go fishing. She still hopes to get to the beach before hurricane season gets intense. On the West Coast, Valerie Christensen says a heat wave interrupted her plans to compete in summer dog shows. (SOUNDBITE OF DOG BARKING)VALERIE CHRISTENSEN: Oh, there we go. (SOUNDBITE OF DOG BARKING)CHRISTENSEN: Frisky. BRADY: Christensen, who lives on Bainbridge Island in Washington state, has three dogs. One of them is a border terrier named Henry, who's won some ribbons this summer. CHRISTENSEN: He doesn't like the heat. I don't know any terriers that like the heat. They sort of wilt when it comes to, like, 75 and above. BRADY: She canceled plans to attend a June show in Oregon because it was a record 114 degrees. Now she looks for shows in cooler locations and away from wildfire smoke. CHRISTENSEN: You know, obviously, it's not good for the animal. And it's not good for me either 'cause you spend pretty much a whole weekend, sometimes as many as four days, outside. BRADY: Climate-fueled wildfires also mean more smoke in special places. Heather Duchow and her husband celebrated their 20th anniversary last month in Montana's Glacier National Park, where they also honeymooned. HEATHER DUCHOW: When we got there, it was very smoky. And it was disappointing. We just - you can't see the distant vistas that the park is known for. BRADY: Duchow is an amateur photographer, and the smoke made it difficult to see the awe-inspiring views she remembered. DUCHOW: Everything that should have been green and white and blue was very orange and brown. BRADY: Duchow says for future anniversaries, they may go sooner in the summer, hoping to avoid the worst of fire season. And she knows this is nothing compared to losses from fires and flooding some people have experienced. Still, how she and everyone else navigates a warming world is changing, and people are figuring out how to adapt.

And now scientists have discovered the first new one in about 20 years. As NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce reports, this plant lives practically in the backyard of major urban centers on the West Coast. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE, BYLINE: The western false asphodel is a pretty little perennial wildflower. Shawn Graham is a botanist with the University of British Columbia. He says, of course, he knew about this flower. It grows all the way from California to Alaska in bogs and on stream banks. SEAN GRAHAM: They're little grass-like plants. They have little tufts of grass-like leaves, but the flowers are more lily-like. So they have clusters of these very attractive little white flowers. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Recently, Graham and his colleagues were working on a project related to plant genetics. It had nothing to do with carnivorous plants, but they happened to notice that the western false asphodel had a genetic deletion that's sometimes seen in plants that eat bugs. The researchers started to think about the fact that this flower grew in places with plenty of sun and water but nutrient-poor soil. GRAHAM: And then they have these sticky stems. So, you know, it was kind of like, I wonder if this could be a sign that this might be carnivorous. GREENFIELDBOYCE: So they checked it out. In the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, they describe new evidence that this plant eats insects. The sticky hairs on its stalk produce a digestive enzyme. And when one of the scientists fed a special kind of nitrogen to fruit flies and then stuck the flies onto the stems, he was later able to show that the plant took up this nitrogen. GRAHAM: So that's kind of a key step to prove carnivory, that they - not only that they're digesting the prey but that the nutrients from the dead animal actually end up in the plant. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Now, this plant has been described in the scientific literature since 1879. Graham says lots of dried specimens are preserved in herbariums. GRAHAM: And you can go, and you can poke around, and you can see insects stuck to the stems. GREENFIELDBOYCE: But nobody until now realized that the stems were a kind of trap. Aaron Ellison is a botanist with Harvard University who was not part of the research team. He says carnivorous plants usually capture prey with modified leaves, and they keep their traps far away from their flowers so as not to inadvertently kill their pollinators. AARON ELLISON: No one would be looking at a flower stalk as the primary mode of carnivory. That is quite a surprise. GREENFIELDBOYCE: It looks like this plant's stalk isn't sticky enough to endanger bees or butterflies. It only captures tiny insects. Graham says it's actually not that uncommon for plants to have sticky stems, which makes him wonder if there are more carnivorous plants out there than scientists think.

And when one of the scientists fed a special kind of nitrogen to fruit flies and then stuck the flies onto the stems, he was later able to show that the plant took up this nitrogen. GRAHAM: So that's kind of a key step to prove carnivory, that they - not only that they're digesting the prey but that the nutrients from the dead animal actually end up in the plant. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Now, this plant has been described in the scientific literature since 1879. Graham says lots of dried specimens are preserved in herbariums. GRAHAM: And you can go, and you can poke around, and you can see insects stuck to the stems. GREENFIELDBOYCE: But nobody until now realized that the stems were a kind of trap. Aaron Ellison is a botanist with Harvard University who was not part of the research team. He says carnivorous plants usually capture prey with modified leaves, and they keep their traps far away from their flowers so as not to inadvertently kill their pollinators. AARON ELLISON: No one would be looking at a flower stalk as the primary mode of carnivory. That is quite a surprise. GREENFIELDBOYCE: It looks like this plant's stalk isn't sticky enough to endanger bees or butterflies. It only captures tiny insects. Graham says it's actually not that uncommon for plants to have sticky stems, which makes him wonder if there are more carnivorous plants out there than scientists think.

Odds are the answer is yes. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #1: Yeah, guys, we're talking literally coast to coast. Temperatures are going to be in the triple digits for parts of the Pacific Northwest into northern California. Then we go into the mid-plains, into the northeast. Heat index is up to 110. CORNISH: At points this week, nearly 200 million Americans were under heat advisories or excessive heat warnings. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #1: Look at these heat indexes - Cincinnati today 101, 111 in St. Louis and Memphis, Shreveport, 106, triple digits for Charlotte, Nashville on into Little Rock, even into New York and Washington, D. C. CORNISH: Now, the weather will eventually change. News cycles will shift to the next thing. But what won't change is the stark reality outlined in this week's landmark report from the U. N. 's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. That's the IPCC. It warned that extreme heat and weather are intensifying and that some of the worst effects of human-caused climate change are on the brink of becoming irreversible. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JOHN KERRY: I talked with one of the scientists who contributed to this effort. And what disturbs me the most, he said, is the irreversibility. You can't turn it around now. CORNISH: At least not all of it. But it's John Kerry's job to try. Kerry is President Biden's special envoy on climate. It falls to him to work with other countries on climate policy and help chart it here at home. This fall, Kerry heads to a major U. N. climate conference in Scotland where, he says, he'll try to convince the world's leading carbon emitters to do more to stop the rapid warming of the planet. And at the same time, the Biden administration is engaged in an uphill battle to take major action on climate here in the U. S. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)KERRY: What the IPCC report was really telling us is that a certain amount of damage is now just cooked in. It's baked, literally. And our challenge is to make sure that we're going to respond to prevent the worst things from happening. CORNISH: CONSIDER THIS - the need to deal with climate change is more urgent than ever. The question is, what will be done? John Kerry's answer is coming up. From NPR, I'm Audie Cornish. It's Thursday, August 12. It's CONSIDER THIS FROM NPR. Back on Earth Day, April 22 of this year, President Biden laid out a goal for the U. S. to cut its carbon emissions by half over the next decade. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: We know just how critically important that is because scientists tell us that this is the decisive decade. This is the decade we must make decisions that will avoid the worst consequences of the climate crisis. CORNISH: This goal to cut emissions in half within this decade, Biden said, would be a big first step toward making America a net zero-carbon emitter by mid-century. And that's something scientists say will have to happen in countries all around the world in order to stop the catastrophic warming of the planet. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BIDEN: Time is short, but I believe we can do this. And I believe that we will do this. CORNISH: At the time, the Biden administration didn't offer a lot of specifics on how it would reach the decade goal. Four months later, their efforts are coming into focus. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #2: Breaking news right now on Capitol Hill, where the Senate just passed the $1 trillion infrastructure bill this morning with strong bipartisan support. CORNISH: On Tuesday, the Senate passed a bipartisan infrastructure bill that does contain some modest climate measures Republicans agreed to. Those include money for updating parts of the power grid, water infrastructure and clean-up of abandoned mines and gas wells. The bill would also fund a national network of electric vehicle chargers. It now heads to the House. And it wasn't the only action on Capitol Hill this week. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #3: Breaking overnight - hours after passing a major infrastructure bill with bipartisan support, the Senate narrowly approved a $3. 5 trillion blueprint for family health and environmental programs. CORNISH: The blueprint, the budget resolution that will be used by committees to create new programs - well, it would invest a lot more money in climate-focused infrastructure and policy. It contains hundreds of billions of dollars for clean energy and vehicle technology, climate research and other initiatives. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BIDEN: After years and years of infrastructure week, we're on the cusp of an infrastructure decade that I truly believe will transform America. CORNISH: On the cusp, the president said this week. He and his fellow Democrats in Congress aren't there yet. They're working to pass both packages in tandem. Some climate experts say that would bring the U. S. close to cutting emissions in half this decade, provided the EPA also tightens up some regulations. But the president's agenda faces a lot of resistance, including from members of his own party. Moderate Democrats in the Senate - Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Krysten Sinema of Arizona - well, they think the budget resolution is too expensive. Manchin, who's also singled out some of its climate provisions as unrealistic, tweeted this week he was concerned about the economy, quote, \"overheating. \" Of course, to more progressive Democrats in Congress, that's not the kind of heat they're worried about. AYANNA PRESSLEY: My progressive colleagues and I, we've been calling for bold investments that meet the moment - so an unprecedented investment at an unprecedented time. CORNISH: Massachusetts Democrat Ayanna Pressley spoke to NPR this week. She and other progressives in the House are under pressure not to support the smaller infrastructure bill unless the budget measure - the big, expensive one with lots more action on climate change - well, unless that one becomes a reality, too. Biden's challenge is to unite the two wings of his party around both of these measures. And it's not clear that one can pass without the other. PRESSLEY: What progressives have been clear about since Day 1 is that any vote on the narrow bipartisan infrastructure package must also come with a movement on a massive investment in tandem for workers and families. And that's care economy, housing, combating climate change. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)CORNISH: That's the political challenge at home. Abroad, things are no less complicated. And the next opportunity for major action will come in November with a U. N. climate summit in Scotland. That's where U. S. climate envoy John Kerry will have his work cut out for him. This week I asked Kerry about the challenge of uniting the world around ambitious climate goals even as Democrats are struggling to agree among themselves at home. KERRY: Well, that's the fight that's ahead. And I think it's important to look at the hard facts. The truth is that the marketplace is already making a decision about energy. CEOs all around the world are now joining in the movement to limit the emissions and to transition their own businesses into net-zero status. CORNISH: So why do you think there's reluctance within your own party? KERRY: Well, I think everybody is concerned that whatever steps are taken are going to be effective and not leave people behind. President Biden is deeply committed to that principle. And I think Joe Manchin and others believe in wanting to do that. But the fact is this is inescapable. You couldn't finance a new coal-fired power plant in the United States of America today. The largest, you know, fastest-growing job last year and, I think, this year also in the United States is wind turbine technician. And the truth is that the marketplace is making its own decision of moving towards renewable, alternative, sustainable energy. CORNISH: So the U. S. produces around 11% of the world's emissions. China produces nearly a third of the world's emissions. And China hasn't made any promises about emissions in this decade. I mean, they're still investing heavily in coal and other fossil fuels. So where do things stand on talks with them? KERRY: Well, we're engaged in continuing discussion with China, and it's very important that China step up and take additional steps between 2020 and 2030. Now, China is currently doing more than many people know or think. China is, in fact, the largest producer of solar panels and of alternative renewable energy in the world. China has, in fact, deployed more of that renewable energy than any other country in the world. But because they're so big, China has to obviously do more faster. And the Chinese are currently in deliberations to try to determine what that will be and can be. CORNISH: But can I stop? - because we're looking at a moment where, as I said, they don't actually have any policy in this direction. KERRY: They have not yet decided to do enough, in our judgment, to be able to meet what we need to do between 2020 and 2030. But it's not fair to say China doesn't have a policy. China is, in fact, implementing some policy, and they are currently in deliberation on more. Now, it's not my job to explain China's policy, except to say that we're - I'm going back to China in about three weeks. My hope is that by that point in time, China will have made some of the decisions that they're in the throes of deliberating now so that we can move forward faster together. If we can't, obviously, that injures everybody else's efforts. I don't think it makes any sense for people to throw up their hands and say, well, if China isn't going to do it, we're not going to do it, because obviously we've all got to do our part to avoid the worst consequences. CORNISH: In the past, the U. S. has made pledges to help poorer countries, for instance, pay for efforts to transition to clean energy. Is there any move to improve that? Have we lived up to that? And what's the plan if we haven't? KERRY: There is a tremendous effort going on to assist less developed nations. We have made a commitment globally that was made in Paris to commit $100 billion a year for, you know, the next 10 years in order to assist those countries to make that transition. Tragically, that amount of money has not yet been fully identified, though the effort to identify it between now Glasgow is in full swing. In addition to that, though, there's trillions of dollars that are going to be needed for this transition. And we, the United States, have worked very closely with the six largest banks in our nation. They've stepped up, and they have announced that they're going to set aside a specific amount of money to invest in accelerating this transition, augmenting it over the course of the next 10 years. That amount of money from the six banks is $4. 16 trillion. And that's a floor, not a ceiling. CORNISH: So are policymakers moving at the same rate as markets? KERRY: This is one of those incredible moments where, frankly, the market is way ahead of political systems in many but not all. The private sector is fully prepared to invest in these sectors, providing governments are making it feasible by getting the bureaucracy out of the way, guaranteeing you can make a decision on the land acquisition needed for some of this deployment and making sure that the revenue stream that supports that financial transaction is there and reliable. CORNISH: Are governments doing that? Is our government doing that? KERRY: We're engaged in this. We're leading this effort to try to make sure that this works. And the answer is yes. Other governments are fully prepared to be engaged in similar transactions. The EU is a terrific partner in this. The U. K. , Canada, Japan have all made decisions that are moving in the right direction. CORNISH: You've been at this for many years, thinking about these issues. What, if anything, about this week felt like a turning point for you? Maybe it's not, but I feel like I should ask. KERRY: Well, no, it didn't, and it doesn't feel like a turning point at this point. It feels like one more in a series of warnings which have been made over 30 years plus. I don't think it took this IPCC report for a whole bunch of people who have been working on this issue for a long time to feel motivated. So the time has come. It has to happen now. CORNISH: One more thing. If you listen closely to people like John Kerry these days, for all that talk about urgent action, you also hear phrases like, in continuing discussions, and, prepared to be engaged. I wanted to ask about that. It sounds like policymakers, people like yourself, are still in the process of convincing governments to do what they need to do, not. . . KERRY: Well, I hate to say it. That's part of the challenge. And you're right. There has been too much indifference. We have an opportunity to have a fighting chance but only if we do these very clear, specific things. Not one country, not 50, but the world has to make a global effort here. CORNISH: And the countries carrying the greatest burden in that effort, Kerry said, are the 20 largest economies of the world, which emit almost 80% of global emissions. They'll be part of that November climate summit in Scotland, which John Kerry has called the last best hope for world action on climate change. It's CONSIDER THIS FROM NPR. I'm Audie Cornish.

Shalina Chatlani of the Gulf States Newsroom reports. SHALINA CHATLANI, BYLINE: Asylum seeker Raudel, who doesn't want to be identified for fear of being targeted, says his only option was to come to the U. S. He was attacked by the police for his political views in Cuba. RAUDEL: (Speaking Spanish). CHATLANI: They took out all of my teeth, he said as he pulled out his dentures. When Raudel got here, he spent five months in ICE detention centers in Mississippi and Louisiana. RAUDEL: (Speaking Spanish). CHATLANI: Many people had coronavirus, and they were put in one place to quarantine together. And they didn't care, he said. There was very little social distancing or mask-wearing. Both sick and healthy people were mixed together during transfers. Our analysis of ICE data over time shows that the weekly percentage of COVID-positive detainees has doubled since mid-June to almost 6% as of last week. MICH GONZALEZ: It's a place where people are being transferred in and transferred out, transferred in and transferred out. Of course they're going to be exposed there. CHATLANI: Immigration attorney Mich Gonzalez with the Southern Poverty Law Center says ICE's New Orleans field office has been holding, moving and releasing detainees under conditions that are not COVID-safe. GONZALEZ: The precautions that they're supposed to be taking don't really work well because they violate their own protocols. CHATLANI: ICE spokesman Dexter Henson says they do follow their transfer and COVID-19 protocols - to move people only when absolutely necessary and make sure they're not sick. DEXTER HENSON: We're doing everything we can to make sure that those that are under our control, that they have ties to the community and a support network near the location that they're detained. CHATLANI: Henson also says that the best way to stop spread is through vaccination. He said the COVID vaccination rate across ICE detention facilities is as high as 70%. Still, Ellen McSweeney with the Department of Homeland Security's Office of Inspector General says it found problems when it randomly inspected one Mississippi facility, Adams Correctional, in February. ELLEN MCSWEENEY: They didn't necessarily always follow sick calls with detailed notes, nor did they always follow up in terms of recordkeeping. The staff and the detainees were not consistently using masks, nor were they consistently ensuring that they were social distancing. CHATLANI: McSweeney said by May, ICE had implemented many of its recommendations at the Adams facility. But OIG has received complaints about facilities from around the country. MCSWEENEY: We have now an ongoing audit that is looked in greater depth at ICE's approach to COVID-19 across detention facilities. CHATLANI: That could take up to a year. In the meantime, immigration advocates and detainees say the best way to avoid COVID-19 spread is to avoid locking up so many people in the first place. UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE: (Speaking Spanish). CHATLANI: Last month, hundreds were released on parole from detention centers in Louisiana, including Raudel. He and his friends were all vaccinated and tested negative for COVID-19 before being sent to a host home in New Orleans. RAUDEL: (Speaking Spanish).

But a part of that report that got a lot less attention than its predictions of more heat waves, droughts and melting glaciers pointed to a hopeful path that it might still be possible to take. NPR's Dan Charles has that story. DAN CHARLES, BYLINE: This vision of the future in which climate change ends comes from giant computer simulations of the world economy - half a dozen different ones at big research institutes, mostly in Europe, created by scientists like Detlef van Vuuren at the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency. DETLEF VAN VUUREN: What we really are mostly doing is trying to explore what is needed to meet the Paris goals. CHARLES: The Paris goals are - keep the world from heating up more than about 3 1/2 degrees Fahrenheit compared to a couple of centuries ago. It'll mean cutting net greenhouse emissions to zero very soon - within about 40 years. It would require profound changes - so profound it's not immediately clear that it's even feasible, which is why van Vuuren and his colleagues turned to their computer models for help. VAN VUUREN: How is it possible to go to zero emissions? So that's for transport. That's for housing. That's for electricity. CHARLES: These models start with data about the world as it is right now - about cars and buses and auto rickshaws, home furnaces and rice paddies, anything that releases greenhouse gases - also what it would cost to do things differently. And then the scientists introduce a new requirement - try to hit that target in a way that's technologically and economically feasible. And the good news is the models found a way. In fact, according to Keywan Riahi at the International Institute for Applied Systems in Austria, they found multiple paths to zero carbon. KEYWAN RIAHI: So the models tell us that there are, first of all, alternative pathways possible, that there are choices available to the decision-maker. CHARLES: Different models show a variety of visions of this future world. But they're all dramatically different from our world today. Some show people responding to higher energy prices or government regulations by changing their lifestyle - living in smaller energy-saving houses or giving up their cars in favor of a new and better kind of public transit, with autonomous vehicles that respond like Uber taking people where they need to go. Others show people still using plenty of energy. Those scenarios require a huge boost in production of clean electricity - 10 or 20 times more land covered with solar and wind farms compared to now, plus more power plants burning wood or other biofuels outfitted with equipment to capture and store the carbon dioxide that's released. Now, Riahi is quick to say what happens in the models may not be feasible in real life. He used to make that mistake. RIAHI: There are phases in a modeler's life (laughter). I would say there's this early phase where you start to believe that the model is the absolute truth. CHARLES: Models can't actually predict the future, Riahi says. They don't account for political obstruction or a lot of human preferences. People may just want to drive an expensive car rather than take public transit. But the models can also be way too pessimistic. Ten years ago, van Vuuren says, they never anticipated the rise of cheap solar power. VAN VUUREN: We have been in the extremely fortunate situation that the cost of renewables have declined rapidly in the last decade.

(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"TODAY\")ANTHONY FAUCI: No vaccine, at least not within this category, is going to have an indefinite amount of protection. CORNISH: Dr. Anthony Fauci on the \"Today\" show last week was asked whether it's inevitable that all Americans considered fully vaccinated will eventually need a booster. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"TODAY\")FAUCI: In answer to your question, it's right. Inevitably, there will be a time when we will have to give boosts. What we're doing literally on a weekly and monthly basis is following cohorts of patients to determine if, when and whom should get it. CORNISH: Now, that determination is apparently close. This week, NPR confirmed reports that Biden administration health officials are coalescing around a plan that would advise booster shots for most fully vaccinated Americans eight months after their last dose. The White House says it will announce more details Wednesday afternoon. Boosters, a source told NPR, could be approved for distribution as soon as next month. And that means that the U. S. could soon be in a situation where many Americans have received three shots and millions more have received none at all. And right now, it's people in the second group who are pushing hospitals in some places to the brink. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED JOURNALIST #1: We're talking about Lakeside Medical Center in Belle Glade. They're at critical levels right now, trying to figure out what to do with their extra COVID-19 patients. CORNISH: This week in Florida, a Palm Beach County hospital ran out of ICU beds. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED JOURNALIST #1: And no other hospital in Palm Beach County would take on the extra ICU patients. CORNISH: In Austin, Texas, There was a single ICU bed at a trauma center serving more than 2 million people. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED JOURNALIST #2: There's one ICU bed available in the Austin Trauma Service Area. CORNISH: And in Jackson, Miss. , the state's only level one trauma center is racing to open a second field hospital in a parking garage. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED JOURNALIST #3: To relieve pressure on UMC, which has been overwhelmed with a flood of COVID-19 patients. CORNISH: The vice chancellor of that medical center, LouAnn Woodward, told NPR almost all of its sickest patients are unvaccinated. LOUANN WOODWARD: They're boarding patients in the emergency departments. Patients are in the hallways. Patients receiving treatments in waiting rooms. It is quite a dire situation for us. CORNISH: CONSIDER THIS - booster shots will not help in regions of the country where many people so far have not been vaccinated at all. So what more can be done? Public health experts say there are options. We'll hear what they are next. From NPR, I'm Audie Cornish. It's Tuesday, August 17. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)CORNISH: It's CONSIDER THIS FROM NPR. Booster shots - while they may soon be advised for most everyone who's been fully vaccinated, last week, federal health agencies officially recommended them for people with weakened immune systems. Those are people who have been receiving certain cancer treatments, maybe had an organ transplant or have other conditions or take drugs that suppress the immune system. It's not that the vaccine is losing effectiveness in those people faster. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)FAUCI: It's that they never really got a very good immune response to begin with. And I think that's the thing that people need to understand to avoid confusion about the durability of response. CORNISH: Anthony Fauci spoke to NPR this past week as the recommendation was being finalized. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)FAUCI: In these individuals whose immune system is compromised, they never really got up high enough to feel that they were protected. That's the reason why it is so imminent to make sure that we get them boosted so that they would be in a protected zone. CORNISH: Immunocompromised individuals make up almost 3% of adults in the U. S. , some 7 million people, and they may make up an outsized number of severe breakthru infections. One U. S. study suggested that as many as 44% of vaccinated people who wind up in the hospital with COVID-19 are immunocompromised. But those breakthrough cases are a tiny fraction of total hospitalizations, which are up 20% in the last week. The vast majority of those are unvaccinated people, and many are clustered in regions of the country with few other public health measures. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)GREG ABBOTT: Lockdowns are wrong during the course of a pandemic. CORNISH: In Texas, Republican Governor Greg Abbott has moved to ban mask mandates in schools and promised no more government lockdowns or mandates. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)ABBOTT: Everyone already knows what to do. Everyone can voluntarily implement the mandates that are safest for them, for their families and for their businesses. CORNISH: In recent days, Abbott has also solicited help from out of state health care workers and asked hospitals to delay non-emergency surgeries. Meanwhile, in Florida. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)RON DESANTIS: We are seeing people testing positive in higher numbers than I think most people anticipated. CORNISH: Republican Governor Ron DeSantis was promoting new availability of monoclonal antibody treatment last week. At the same time, he's been fighting school districts over mask mandates and threatened to withhold salaries of officials who implement them. The governor's political team has also been selling beer cozies and T-shirts with the slogan don't Fauci my Florida. In recent weeks, Florida and Texas combined have accounted for more than 40% of new hospitalizations in the country. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)DESANTIS: It's airborne. It's aerosolized. And so we just have to understand that when that's happening, these waves are something that you have to deal with preventive - with early treatment. CORNISH: But early treatment has not slowed things down in Florida or in Arkansas. For the fifth week in a row, the state has a record number of people in the hospital. Earlier this month, Governor Asa Hutchinson said he regretted signing a bill this year that banned state and local mask mandates. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)ASA HUTCHINSON: Our cases are at a low point. Everything has changed now. And yes, in hindsight, I wish that had not become law, but it is the law. CORNISH: Hutchinson is asking his fellow Republicans in the state legislature to undo that law, and there's no indication they will. In fact, they're talking about trying to ban companies in Arkansas from mandating vaccines for employees. Recently, two big firms headquartered there, Tyson Foods and Walmart, did just that. So aside from increasing the vaccination rate and eventually giving booster shots, what more could states struggling through the delta surge do? Well, turns out, plenty. NPR's Selena Simmons-Duffin has been following a group of scientists trying to figure out the perfect recipe for effective public health measures. SELENA SIMMONS-DUFFIN, BYLINE: If you've ever felt confused over the course of the pandemic, trying to keep track of which restrictions were on at a given moment in your community, like still no indoor dining, right? Masks at the grocery store? No? Then consider this feat. A team of researchers at the University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon University created a database of every statewide restriction and every time restrictions were lifted in all 50 states plus D. C. since last March. SEEMA LAKDAWALA: I mean, truly, this was a labor of love. SIMMONS-DUFFIN: Seema Lakdawala was one of the project leads. Usually, she studies influenza transmission at the University of Pittsburgh, like lab work. LAKDAWALA: We're mostly an experimental lab. We do a lot of molecular virology and animal model-based transmission studies. SIMMONS-DUFFIN: But when she and her staff were home, like everyone else in March of 2020, they got curious about what impact these restrictions would have on transmission of the virus. They started scouring state websites for restriction announcements. LAKDAWALA: So we came up with a rubric to say, well, how strong were the interventions based on multiple categories? Masking, gathering size bans, stay-at-home orders, closing non-essential businesses, restaurant and bar closures, restrictions. SIMMONS-DUFFIN: Then she decided they needed help figuring out what it all meant, so she phoned a friend. REBECCA NUGENT: My name is Rebecca Nugent. I am the head of the Department of Statistics and Data Science at Carnegie Mellon University. SIMMONS-DUFFIN: With a full team assembled, one of the ways they crunched the numbers was to graph out for each state how cases and deaths grew - those curves that show peaks during a surge - and then mark when restrictions were put in place or lifted to show whether restrictions helped to flatten the curves. It turned out. . . NUGENT: It worked. They have an impact. They are contributing to the control of the spread. SIMMONS-DUFFIN: Granted, timing is really important. The researchers found it was better to put restrictions in early, before a surge had really had a chance to heat up, and then keep them in place for a while. It took about four weeks or so before they started to pay off. Lakdawala explains they also found there seemed to be a sweet spot. When states had several kinds of moderate restrictions in place for long enough, that worked particularly well. LAKDAWALA: Some level of masking, some level of restaurant or bar restrictions and some level of gathering size bans. Those, we think, are the critical three. SIMMONS-DUFFIN: What they couldn't figure out was whether some restrictions are better than others, like are restaurant closures more important than limiting the size of gatherings? Because a lot of times, the restrictions went into place as a package, so they couldn't tease apart the impact of one versus another. Melissa McPheeters, an epidemiologist at RTI International who wasn't involved in the research, calls the database this team made a terrific resource, especially since even though there are now highly effective vaccines available, at the moment. . . MELISSA MCPHEETERS: We don't have enough people vaccinated. And we don't have enough people who can be vaccinated. Think about all the children who aren't eligible yet. And so we need to do combinations of things. SIMMONS-DUFFIN: That might look like getting vaccinated and masking, keeping gatherings small, good handwashing, good ventilation and the rest. Because even though delta is highly contagious and taking off across the country, all of these tools to flatten the curve do still work. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)CORNISH: That's NPR's Selena Simmons-Duffin. By the way, earlier we spoke about boosters for people with weakened immune systems. And if that's you or someone you know, NPR has a list of things to think about for immunocompromised people considering a booster shot. You can find a link in our episode notes. It's CONSIDER THIS FROM NPR. I'm Audie Cornish. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:   We've known for a while booster shots are coming.

That's the reason why it is so imminent to make sure that we get them boosted so that they would be in a protected zone. CORNISH: Immunocompromised individuals make up almost 3% of adults in the U. S. , some 7 million people, and they may make up an outsized number of severe breakthru infections. One U. S. study suggested that as many as 44% of vaccinated people who wind up in the hospital with COVID-19 are immunocompromised. But those breakthrough cases are a tiny fraction of total hospitalizations, which are up 20% in the last week. The vast majority of those are unvaccinated people, and many are clustered in regions of the country with few other public health measures. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) GREG ABBOTT: Lockdowns are wrong during the course of a pandemic. CORNISH: In Texas, Republican Governor Greg Abbott has moved to ban mask mandates in schools and promised no more government lockdowns or mandates. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ABBOTT: Everyone already knows what to do. Everyone can voluntarily implement the mandates that are safest for them, for their families and for their businesses. CORNISH: In recent days, Abbott has also solicited help from out of state health care workers and asked hospitals to delay non-emergency surgeries. Meanwhile, in Florida. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) RON DESANTIS: We are seeing people testing positive in higher numbers than I think most people anticipated. CORNISH: Republican Governor Ron DeSantis was promoting new availability of monoclonal antibody treatment last week. At the same time, he's been fighting school districts over mask mandates and threatened to withhold salaries of officials who implement them. The governor's political team has also been selling beer cozies and T-shirts with the slogan don't Fauci my Florida. In recent weeks, Florida and Texas combined have accounted for more than 40% of new hospitalizations in the country. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DESANTIS: It's airborne. It's aerosolized. And so we just have to understand that when that's happening, these waves are something that you have to deal with preventive - with early treatment. CORNISH: But early treatment has not slowed things down in Florida or in Arkansas. For the fifth week in a row, the state has a record number of people in the hospital. Earlier this month, Governor Asa Hutchinson said he regretted signing a bill this year that banned state and local mask mandates. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ASA HUTCHINSON: Our cases are at a low point. Everything has changed now. And yes, in hindsight, I wish that had not become law, but it is the law. CORNISH: Hutchinson is asking his fellow Republicans in the state legislature to undo that law, and there's no indication they will. In fact, they're talking about trying to ban companies in Arkansas from mandating vaccines for employees. Recently, two big firms headquartered there, Tyson Foods and Walmart, did just that. So aside from increasing the vaccination rate and eventually giving booster shots, what more could states struggling through the delta surge do? Well, turns out, plenty. NPR's Selena Simmons-Duffin has been following a group of scientists trying to figure out the perfect recipe for effective public health measures. SELENA SIMMONS-DUFFIN, BYLINE: If you've ever felt confused over the course of the pandemic, trying to keep track of which restrictions were on at a given moment in your community, like still no indoor dining, right? Masks at the grocery store? No? Then consider this feat. A team of researchers at the University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon University created a database of every statewide restriction and every time restrictions were lifted in all 50 states plus D. C. since last March. SEEMA LAKDAWALA: I mean, truly, this was a labor of love. SIMMONS-DUFFIN: Seema Lakdawala was one of the project leads. Usually, she studies influenza transmission at the University of Pittsburgh, like lab work. LAKDAWALA: We're mostly an experimental lab. We do a lot of molecular virology and animal model-based transmission studies. SIMMONS-DUFFIN: But when she and her staff were home, like everyone else in March of 2020, they got curious about what impact these restrictions would have on transmission of the virus. They started scouring state websites for restriction announcements. LAKDAWALA: So we came up with a rubric to say, well, how strong were the interventions based on multiple categories? Masking, gathering size bans, stay-at-home orders, closing non-essential businesses, restaurant and bar closures, restrictions. SIMMONS-DUFFIN: Then she decided they needed help figuring out what it all meant, so she phoned a friend. REBECCA NUGENT: My name is Rebecca Nugent. I am the head of the Department of Statistics and Data Science at Carnegie Mellon University. SIMMONS-DUFFIN: With a full team assembled, one of the ways they crunched the numbers was to graph out for each state how cases and deaths grew - those curves that show peaks during a surge - and then mark when restrictions were put in place or lifted to show whether restrictions helped to flatten the curves. It turned out. . . NUGENT: It worked. They have an impact. They are contributing to the control of the spread. SIMMONS-DUFFIN: Granted, timing is really important. The researchers found it was better to put restrictions in early, before a surge had really had a chance to heat up, and then keep them in place for a while. It took about four weeks or so before they started to pay off. Lakdawala explains they also found there seemed to be a sweet spot. When states had several kinds of moderate restrictions in place for long enough, that worked particularly well. LAKDAWALA: Some level of masking, some level of restaurant or bar restrictions and some level of gathering size bans. Those, we think, are the critical three. SIMMONS-DUFFIN: What they couldn't figure out was whether some restrictions are better than others, like are restaurant closures more important than limiting the size of gatherings? Because a lot of times, the restrictions went into place as a package, so they couldn't tease apart the impact of one versus another. Melissa McPheeters, an epidemiologist at RTI International who wasn't involved in the research, calls the database this team made a terrific resource, especially since even though there are now highly effective vaccines available, at the moment. . . MELISSA MCPHEETERS: We don't have enough people vaccinated. And we don't have enough people who can be vaccinated. Think about all the children who aren't eligible yet. And so we need to do combinations of things. SIMMONS-DUFFIN: That might look like getting vaccinated and masking, keeping gatherings small, good handwashing, good ventilation and the rest. Because even though delta is highly contagious and taking off across the country, all of these tools to flatten the curve do still work. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) CORNISH: That's NPR's Selena Simmons-Duffin. By the way, earlier we spoke about boosters for people with weakened immune systems. And if that's you or someone you know, NPR has a list of things to think about for immunocompromised people considering a booster shot. You can find a link in our episode notes.

Rebecca Hersher from NPR's climate team is here to talk about this. Hi, Rebecca. REBECCA HERSHER, BYLINE: Hi there. FADEL: So this is the second time Tennessee has seen deadly flash floods this year. Floods in Nashville killed at least four people back in March. Is this a trend? HERSHER: Yes. And, you know, it's a trend that's driven by global warming. So as the Earth gets hotter, we're seeing more heavy rain. And that's when a lot of rain falls in a very short period of time, as the sheriff was just describing. FADEL: Yeah. HERSHER: And I think especially this time of year, a lot of people in the U. S. might imagine heavy rain from a hurricane, but there doesn't have to be a big storm for there to be catastrophic water. You know, thunderstorms can cause really serious flash flooding. And we've seen it outside the U. S. as well. So China, Germany, Belgium and India - they've all experienced deadly flash floods this year just from rainstorms. FADEL: So are climate scientists able to measure exactly how much more rain is happening because of climate change? HERSHER: Yeah, and that's actually one of the wild things about this current moment. So global warming has progressed so far that scientists can actually see it happening in real time. So in the Southeastern U. S. , which includes Tennessee, the amount of water falling during the heaviest rainstorms has increased by almost a third between 1958 and 2016. So that's a lot more water, right? FADEL: Yeah. HERSHER: And it's not just the Southeast. So heavy rain has increased by more than a third in the rest of the Eastern U. S. Even in the West, where the big story this summer has been drought, when it does rain, the rain is more likely to fall all at once and cause flooding. So we've seen that this summer with flash floods in Arizona and in Colorado. FADEL: OK, wait. That's counterintuitive. States that are in the middle of a record-breaking drought can also experience climate-driven flooding? Why? HERSHER: Yeah, it is counterintuitive. So it actually goes back to the same underlying forces that cause the deadly floods in Tennessee. So at a basic level, hotter air can hold more moisture. The Earth is almost 2 degrees Fahrenheit hotter than it was in the late 1800s. And hot air also dries out soil. So when we're talking about places with drought, that's certainly at play. It's also happening to a lesser extent in the Eastern U. S. And the problem with dry soil is that it's less absorbent. So when a lot of rain falls really, really quickly, like the sheriff was just describing, the water can't soak in. It runs off the surface. And all that runoff is way too much for drainage pipes and even for rivers, right? It overwhelms the landscape. And that's when you see this really fast-moving, really powerful water that can carry away cars. It can destroy houses. And it can kill people. FADEL: So it seems like living with climate change means living with more of this devastating flash flooding. What can be done to protect people? HERSHER: There are a lot of options, actually. And we're seeing towns and cities spend more and more money on this as the climate changes. So, for example, upgrading drainage systems, you know, putting in bigger pipes, slowing down the water by making sure that there are unpaved places for it to collect. Another option is to make sure people aren't living in the areas that are most prone to flash flooding and putting warning systems on roads so that people don't accidentally drive into deep water. And of course, the last thing that can be done is, you know, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions quickly. If the Earth stops heating up, heavy rain will stop accelerating as well.

That has been proven. It is also known that when fires get big enough, they can create their own weather, which can include so-called fire tornadoes. What's unknown is how common extreme phenomena like fire tornadoes are. Montana Public Radio's Nick Mott checked in on the state of the science. NICK MOTT, BYLINE: As hundreds of wildfires have broken out across the country this year, lots of people have been seeing videos like this one from the over 10,000-acre Tennant Fire in Northern California that was posted on Facebook in late June. (SOUNDBITE OF WIND BLOWING)MOTT: It's a funnel cloud, like the kind that form tornadoes or, more commonly, dust devils. But this one is a swirl of smoke and flame. It's pretty dramatic and scary-looking in the video as it approaches fire engines, heavy machinery and a hotel sign swaying in the wind. (SOUNDBITE OF WIND BLOWING)MOTT: Jason Forthofer, a firefighter and mechanical engineer at the U. S. Forest Service's Missoula Fire Sciences Lab in Montana, says funnels like this one, which is large enough to do some damage, are called fire whirls. JASON FORTHOFER: Fire tornadoes are more of that larger version of a fire whirl, and they are really the size and scale of a regular tornado. MOTT: It stands to reason that with longer and more intense fire seasons, we're now seeing more fire whirls and fire tornadoes, but. . . FORTHOFER: Most likely, it's much easier to document them now because everybody walks around with a camera essentially in their pocket on their phone. MOTT: He says the data is too young to be sure, but it's plausible more of these are happening as fires grow more intense and the conditions that create them more frequent. The ingredients that create fire whirls are heat, rotating air and conditions that stretch out that rotation along its axis, making it stronger. Forthofer can create them in a chamber in the lab here. He heads toward an empty 12-foot-tall tube. He puts alcohol into its bottom to prepare it to catch flame.

(SOUNDBITE OF WIND BLOWING)MOTT: In the real world, it's hard to say how frequently fire whirls or tornadoes happened in the past since they often occur in remote areas with no one around, but Forthofer went looking for them. He found evidence of fire tornadoes as far back as 1871, when catastrophic fires hit Chicago and Wisconsin. FORTHOFER: I realized that these giant tornado-sized fire whirls, let's call them, happen more frequently than we thought. And a lot of firefighters didn't even realize that that was even a thing, that that was even possible. JULIE MALINGOWSKI: They are rare, but they can happen. MOTT: Meteorologist Julie Malingowski gives firefighters weather updates on the ground during wildfires. That can be life or death information. She says the most important factors day to day are more mundane, like heat, wind and relative humidity. MALINGOWSKI: Everything the fire does as far as spread, as soon as a fire breaks out, is reliant on what the weather's doing around it. MOTT: And researchers are tracking other extreme weather behavior produced by fires, like fire-generated thunderstorms from what are called pyrocumulonimbus clouds, or pyroCBs. They can produce dangerous conditions, including those necessary for fire tornadoes to occur. Michael Fromm is a meteorologist at the Naval Research Lab in Washington, D. C. He says the data set only goes back less than a decade, but. . . MICHAEL FROMM: In terms of the head count of pyroCBs this season, it's already achieved a number, I think, that exceeds what we've seen in the past. And the fire season isn't even over yet.

And a lot of firefighters didn't even realize that that was even a thing, that that was even possible. JULIE MALINGOWSKI: They are rare, but they can happen. MOTT: Meteorologist Julie Malingowski gives firefighters weather updates on the ground during wildfires. That can be life or death information. She says the most important factors day to day are more mundane, like heat, wind and relative humidity. MALINGOWSKI: Everything the fire does as far as spread, as soon as a fire breaks out, is reliant on what the weather's doing around it. MOTT: And researchers are tracking other extreme weather behavior produced by fires, like fire-generated thunderstorms from what are called pyrocumulonimbus clouds, or pyroCBs. They can produce dangerous conditions, including those necessary for fire tornadoes to occur. Michael Fromm is a meteorologist at the Naval Research Lab in Washington, D. C. He says the data set only goes back less than a decade, but. . . MICHAEL FROMM: In terms of the head count of pyroCBs this season, it's already achieved a number, I think, that exceeds what we've seen in the past. And the fire season isn't even over yet.

Many scientists believe that the virus likely came from nature. But an alternative view is that it leaked from a laboratory in China, a theory that had been dismissed by many as a conspiracy theory until recent months. Joining us to discuss what this report might say is NPR's science and security correspondent Geoff Brumfiel. Good morning, Geoff. GEOFF BRUMFIEL, BYLINE: Good morning, Leila. FADEL: So, Geoff, just remind us again why the Biden administration ordered this review. BRUMFIEL: Well, as you said there at the top, there are two theories about how this pandemic got started. First is the idea that it came from nature, probably started in bats and maybe came through markets in the Chinese city of Wuhan, where they were selling animals that might have caught it from the bats. Theory No. 2 is that a laboratory leaked the virus, and the chief suspect there is the Wuhan Institute of Virology because it studies coronaviruses. The Trump administration had pushed quite hard that lab leak theory, and Republicans in Congress have continued that push. And that's why in May, Biden announced this review of the intelligence. FADEL: And what does the review involve? BRUMFIEL: Well, basically, it involves the nation's intelligence agencies rechecking all the stuff they've already collected to see if anything's been missed. That could include everything from communications to databases to information from people on the ground, any of which could shed light on where this virus came from. The president will be briefed, then members of Congress, and eventually there's going to be an unclassified version, we're told. FADEL: Could this report actually settle the question, though, of where the virus came from? BRUMFIEL: I mean, I've been talking to people from both the scientific and the intelligence world. And honestly, everyone's kind of doubtful this report will put the question to rest. First of all, the intelligence agencies weren't really that focused on Wuhan or bat virus research before the pandemic. So. . . FADEL: Right. BRUMFIEL: . . . It's not clear how much intelligence they would have collected in late 2019. That's sort of the time period that matters. On the scientific side, it just takes a lot of legwork to figure out where viruses come from. So, you know, with the first SARS virus, they were eventually able to track it down to a cave full of bats, but that took a lot of animal sampling, tromping all over China. It's not the sort of thing you can do from a computer. FADEL: Right. BRUMFIEL: Now, there is one place this report might really add something new. CNN reported earlier this month that the intelligence agencies might have gotten a hold of a database of viral genetic sequences from the suspect lab. Now, if that database had a sequence that was virtually identical to SARS-CoV-2, that would be a strong indication the lab may have been working with the virus. But scientists I've spoken to say it would need to be a nearly identical match, and even then, there'd probably still be some questions. FADEL: So are we ever going to know how this started? BRUMFIEL: You know, there's always a chance that this intel report is going to hold some bombshell that we don't know about. But assuming it doesn't, it's not really looking great right now. And the real problem here is China itself. The Chinese government has refused to share data about the pandemic early on. It's blocking investigators from the World Health Organization. And lately, it's been pushing this idea that the virus came from an American lab, which is really false. So, I mean, the bottom line is everyone I speak to thinks China's involved with the cover-up. The question is, what are they covering up - lab leak or spillover? And unfortunately, the answer to that really matters, but it'll be hard to tell without their help. FADEL: NPR's science and security correspondent Geoff Brumfiel, thank you. BRUMFIEL: Thanks.

NPR health correspondent Rob Stein joins us now with the details. Hi, Rob. ROB STEIN, BYLINE: Good morning. FADEL: So we've heard that people who got the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines will probably be getting boosters, but a Johnson & Johnson booster had been up in the air. Why is that, and what's new? STEIN: So the Biden administration announced plans last week to start offering everyone who got the Moderna or Pfizer vaccines boosters starting next month, you know, assuming the Food and Drug Administration and the CDC sign off on the plan. But federal officials have been waiting for data from Johnson & Johnson about whether boosters would be a good idea for that vaccine, too. And that's what's new, that Johnson & Johnson says it now has that data. The company says it looked at antibody levels in people who got the Johnson & Johnson vaccine and then got a second shot six months later. And within a week, the company says antibodies shot up ninefold. And the company says that shows giving millions of people who got the J & J vaccine shot a booster eight months later could help protect them, too. FADEL: And how strong is that evidence? STEIN: You know, I talked to several independent experts about this. And the first thing to note is that the company hasn't released much detail about the new data. The company says two papers have been submitted to be posted online, but that hasn't happened yet. And even when it does, the research won't have been reviewed by independent experts. The study focused on just 17 people and just showed that antibody levels were boosted. The assumption is that would translate into stronger protection, but there's no way to know that until lots of people actually get boosters that are followed for a while to see what actually happens. You know, all that said, the experts say a ninefold increase in antibodies is pretty good and a pretty good indication that a booster would help. Here's Saad Omer. He's a researcher at Yale. SAAD OMER: It would be reasonable to say that, yes, you know, have at least two doses of J & J or, you know, have at least one more dose for those who've received a single dose, including the option of having another J & J. FADEL: So do people who received the Johnson & Johnson shot need a booster? STEIN: Yeah, that's a good question. You know, the initial study suggested that the Johnson & Johnson vaccine may not offer quite as strong protection as the Moderna and Pfizer shots, though it still is quite good at keeping people from getting really sick or dying. But some more recent research has suggested that the protection from the J & J shot may actually be holding up quite well against the delta variant. So it's been unclear whether a booster is really needed. But you know, the company says it's planning to submit the new data to the FDA as part of the agency's considerations about authorizing boosters for everyone just in case it's needed. Because you know, we are seeing protection from the other vaccines which were administered earlier starting to wane. FADEL: Right. So where do things stand with boosters overall? STEIN: You know, other countries have started giving boosters, and in this country, doctors have started giving boosters to people with weakened immune systems. And as we mentioned, the Biden administration has already announced plans to start offering boosters to everyone who got the Pfizer and Moderna shots starting September 20. Federal officials have stressed that so far the vaccines still are really good at keeping people from getting really sick and dying. But there is evidence that the protection has started to wane, especially against the highly contagious delta variant. FADEL: Right. STEIN: So the FDA has started looking at the data supporting the need for boosters, and the CDC is scheduled to take a look at this next week. And the assumption is, boosters will start coming for millions of people pretty soon. FADEL: NPR's health correspondent Rob Stein. Thank you. STEIN: You bet.

Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards spoke about the damage earlier today. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JOHN BEL EDWARDS: We are still in a life-saving mode here, doing search and rescue. The roads, the highways into the most affected area were completely clogged with debris. CORNISH: Rebecca Hersher from NPR's climate team is here with more about how climate change helped Ida get big, powerful and destructive. Rebecca, I want to just set the stage here. This is peak hurricane season in the U. S. It's normal to see powerful storms this time of year. What is it about climate change that is affecting a storm like Ida? REBECCA HERSHER, BYLINE: So climate change is basically supercharging this storm. So what climate change does is it adds fuel to a hurricane, fuel in the form of heat. So hurricanes form over water. You can think of them like engines spinning up like a propeller on a plane. And the energy for that propeller comes from the heat in the water. As the Earth gets hotter because of climate change, the water on the surface of the ocean - it also gets hotter. So there's more energy for storms like Ida to get really big and really powerful. CORNISH: What's the evidence for that? How do we know this happened with Ida specifically? HERSHER: So we can basically observe it in real time, which is pretty terrifying. So, for example, let's talk about the wind. On Saturday, the day before Ida made landfall, it had top wind speeds of about 85 miles an hour, which is pretty serious. It can remove shingles from a roof or snap off the limb of a tree. But overnight, the storm got a lot more powerful. The top wind speeds jumped to about 150 miles an hour. That is fast enough to tear whole roofs off of houses, snap power poles, you know, uproot entire trees. And that extra power - it came from the water in the Gulf of Mexico. CORNISH: What do you mean by that? How, like, warm was that water? HERSHER: It was basically like a bathtub - about 85 degrees, which is a few degrees warmer than average if you look at measurements from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. So weather forecasters could watch the storm feed on that heat. And when a hurricane gains that much power that quickly, scientists call it rapid intensification. So studies have found that hurricanes are more likely to rapidly intensify because of global warming. And people who live on the Gulf Coast of the U. S. - they are on the frontlines of this. You know, Hurricane Harvey did this in 2017, Michael in 2018, Laura in 2020 and now Ida. They have all rapidly intensified. CORNISH: Does the speed of the intensity translate to a more powerful storm? HERSHER: Yes. Yes, it does. And it also gives people less time to prepare. So when we're talking about these really fast wind speeds that come really quickly, you know, there's less time. There might not be time to evacuate by the time you know the storm is going to be that powerful. And the National Weather Service tries to get around this by putting out warnings, saying basically, you know, this storm is likely to get a lot stronger before it makes landfall. But it can be really hard to convince people to take a storm seriously when it intensifies really late. CORNISH: Ida at this point is a tropical storm. It's heading northeast. Is climate change playing a role in kind of what happens next, how it's moving? HERSHER: Yes, absolutely. So the hot water in the Gulf of Mexico also helped the storm sucked up moisture that falls as rain. It is really important to remember that these storms can cause flooding really far inland. So in Mississippi, we're going to see a lot of flooding. And then the track goes through central Tennessee, where they just had a lot of deadly flash floods. So people in the path need to take those flood warnings really seriously. CORNISH: That's Rebecca Hersher from NPR's climate team. Thank you for your reporting. HERSHER: Thanks so much.

Yet another bad fire season has Western states considering new policies to prevent these disasters, and they're copying the region that's leading the nation in fire prevention efforts - the Southeast. NPR's Lauren Sommer reports. (SOUNDBITE OF FIRE CRACKLING)LAUREN SOMMER, BYLINE: Back in May, Morgan Varner watched as flames crept along a forest floor. MORGAN VARNER: We're burning in a shortleaf pine woodland. It burned about two years ago. SOMMER: This fire was set on purpose. It's what's known as a prescribed fire. The idea is to clear out the brush and leaves so they don't build up and become the fuel for extreme fires. VARNER: The hazard is very low. The risk is very low. SOMMER: But this isn't California or Montana. Varner is in Tallahassee, Fla. VARNER: The Southeast burns about almost three-quarters of all the prescribed burning in the U. S. annually. Florida is far and away the No. 1 state. SOMMER: Varner is the director of fire research for Tall Timbers, a research station and land conservancy in Tallahassee. He says forests and woodlands in the West and South have a lot in common. Fire used to happen regularly. VARNER: Before colonization, they were burned really frequently through lightning and the really high density of Native American populations. SOMMER: Then came the era of fire suppression. Federal agencies like the Forest Service had mandates to extinguish all fires. Smokey Bear taught generations that fire was the enemy. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As Smokey Bear) Only you. . . SOMMER: But in the South, landowners found the forests were getting overgrown. So in 1990, Florida passed a law to encourage prescribed burns. It set up a certification training program for burn managers, also known as burn bosses. As long as the weather conditions are safe, getting a burn permit is quick. VARNER: So it's a single permit, a single call. And, you know, in California or some other places, the approval for a fire starts not minutes, but months ahead of time. SOMMER: The key thing, Varner says, is that burning has become part of the social fabric. Landowners encourage each other. VARNER: There is a little bit of one-upmanship or one-upwomanship (ph) where they will talk about sort of, like, have you even burned your property lately? - you know, that sort of thing. SOMMER: That's the model that Western states are starting to copy. LENYA QUINN-DAVIDSON: We have this generational gap in fire knowledge in the Western U. S. that we're trying to rebuild now. But Florida and the Southeast still have it. SOMMER: Lenya Quinn-Davidson is a fire adviser for the University of California Cooperative Extension. So far this year, Florida has done controlled burns on 45 times more land than California - mostly private land. In California, Quinn-Davidson says private landowners get little support. QUINN-DAVIDSON: They are managing and taking care of the lands around our towns and communities. They're critical in this larger vision of California living with fire. SOMMER: She says one big problem in California is liability. It's rare for a prescribed burn to get out of control, but it has happened. In the Southeast, burn bosses are protected from liability lawsuits unless they're grossly negligent. QUINN-DAVIDSON: When I go out and burn, I have no liability protection. I'm assuming full responsibility for those projects, and most of the time we're doing those projects for public benefit. SOMMER: California state legislators are now considering a bill that would provide some liability protection. Oregon and New Mexico passed similar laws this year. And all three states are setting up certification programs to get more burn bosses on the ground. QUINN-DAVIDSON: That's how we're going to rebuild a fire culture in California - is letting people actually touch it and have a hands-on connection with it and to know that it doesn't all have to be bad. SOMMER: Quinn-Davidson says it may take time to build that social license for fire again. Even now, the U. S. Forest Service stopped prescribed burning on federal land this month because the agency is overtaxed fighting extreme fires. But with smoke from catastrophic fires now clogging the skies for weeks, more and more Westerners are seeing controlled burns as part of the solution for the future. Lauren Sommer, NPR News. A MARTINEZ, HOST:   More than 60,000 people are being evacuated from their homes in California due to extreme wildfires. Yet another bad fire season has Western states considering new policies to prevent these disasters, and they're copying the region that's leading the nation in fire prevention efforts - the Southeast. NPR's Lauren Sommer reports. (SOUNDBITE OF FIRE CRACKLING) LAUREN SOMMER, BYLINE: Back in May, Morgan Varner watched as flames crept along a forest floor. MORGAN VARNER: We're burning in a shortleaf pine woodland. It burned about two years ago. SOMMER: This fire was set on purpose. It's what's known as a prescribed fire. The idea is to clear out the brush and leaves so they don't build up and become the fuel for extreme fires. VARNER: The hazard is very low. The risk is very low. SOMMER: But this isn't California or Montana. Varner is in Tallahassee, Fla. VARNER: The Southeast burns about almost three-quarters of all the prescribed burning in the U. S. annually. Florida is far and away the No. 1 state. SOMMER: Varner is the director of fire research for Tall Timbers, a research station and land conservancy in Tallahassee. He says forests and woodlands in the West and South have a lot in common. Fire used to happen regularly. VARNER: Before colonization, they were burned really frequently through lightning and the really high density of Native American populations. SOMMER: Then came the era of fire suppression. Federal agencies like the Forest Service had mandates to extinguish all fires. Smokey Bear taught generations that fire was the enemy.

We want to know what's going on with COVID where we live, so we pull up a COVID dashboard online. States have them, counties have them. They tell you about new cases, how many people are in hospitals. The data is supposed to get pulled together by the CDC, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention - except it's not. Austin Fast of NPR's investigations team reports. AUSTIN FAST, BYLINE: So for those of us who track data about COVID, there's this mystery. We know there have been 38 million confirmed cases across the country, but when you want to dig into the details, you can't find them. They're missing for 7 million people. JOSH ZARRABI: When you go and you look at the map and you see Texas in gray and you see there's no data coming out of Texas. FAST: Josh Zarrabi tracks how diseases affects different races and ages with Atlanta's Morehouse School of Medicine. His online maps have big gray spaces in states without good COVID data. ZARRABI: I think a lot of Americans to be unhappy about that because we're missing a huge piece of the puzzle here. FAST: Those puzzle pieces help the CDC put together the big picture of COVID, things like race, gender and age, symptoms and whether the patient was hospitalized or died, all details that can help the CDC more accurately track who's getting COVID-19 and better protect at-risk groups. It's not required, but most states send that information to the CDC. A handful have not - Texas, Missouri, Louisiana, West Virginia and Wyoming, among others. NANCY KRIEGER: That is ludicrous. It is shameful. It is wrong. FAST: Nancy Krieger studies health equity as an epidemiologist at Harvard University. KRIEGER: You need good data to do proper planning to understand what the risk is, how the risk is changing. FAST: At the CDC, Paula Yoon is the person who does that planning. Her team watches about 120 diseases, including COVID. But important details for 1 of every 5 reported COVID cases are completely missing. Their job would be simpler if they just had that data. PAULA YOON: Yes, we would be in a much better place. It's not because the states are not sharing those data with us. It's because the states don't have the data themselves. FAST: There are plenty of reasons why. For one, counties don't have the money to upgrade the tech they need to track diseases. Ideally, counties would enter it once and it would automatically show up for the state and CDC. But near Kansas City, Mo. , like many other places, workers manually copy and paste data field by field, and hospitals fax records to county health departments. Disease prevention manager Chip Cohlmia jokes that health departments keep fax machines alive. CHIP COHLMIA: It's like having an old car and you're needing to push the car to like a hundred miles an hour, but, you know, you haven't changed the oil. You haven't checked the tires. FAST: There's another challenge. Just like the feds can't always mandate what states must do, states can't always tell counties what to do or even want to. DIANA CERVANTES: I wouldn't touch that with a 10-foot pole. FAST: Diana Cervantes teaches at the University of North Texas. She used to supervise 49 counties for the Texas State Health Department. She says the state prefers not to dictate how counties gather data. CERVANTES: We don't want to start getting in power struggles with the locals. FAST: And county leaders can do whatever they want. In Ellis County, near Dallas, Todd Little is in charge. And earlier this year, his staff was overwhelmed, trying to keep up with all the cases. TODD LITTLE: At this point, we're ready to move on with our lives and experience the freedom that all Texans get to experience on a daily basis. We're ready to move on. KRIEGER: We should have these data at this point. FAST: Epidemiologist Nancy Krieger. KRIEGER: The answer to having not good enough data is to make it really public that it's not good enough and to figure out, how do you make it better? FAST: Texas plans to get whatever case data it has to the CDC's system in October. In Missouri, they expect a fix by late September. Texas has over 3 million cases to submit, and a handful of other states each have hundreds of thousands to work through. As COVID surges again, their to do list will just keep growing.

DAVID KIMBERLIN: Mobile, Ala. , last week had no ambulances. Doctors are doing CPR in the back of pickup trucks. SHAPIRO: Dr. David Kimberlin is a pediatric infectious disease specialist at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. He spoke to NPR last week. KIMBERLIN: The ambulances, when they do finally - are able to pick somebody up, they take them, and they either have to park them outside the emergency room, and the ambulance stays tied up because the patient is on the stretcher in the ambulance, nowhere to go inside. Or sometimes, if the patient's well enough, they'll put them in a chair, like a folding chair, outside the emergency room and leave them there. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)SHAPIRO: In Alabama, there are just under 3,000 COVID patients in hospitals across the state. And by one projection from the University of Alabama at Birmingham, over the next three to four weeks that number will grow to more than 5,000 patients. That means the wait for an ambulance will get even longer, space in the emergency room even more scarce, health care workers even more exhausted. KIMBERLIN: Our system in Alabama - and I use this word deliberately and carefully - it is nearing collapse. And I truly cannot overemphasize how terrible things are right now. And that's with almost 2,800 in the hospital. With a projection to go over 5,000? It is so unprecedented, and I honestly don't know what it looks like on the other side of this. SHAPIRO: CONSIDER THIS - hospitals are buckling in a handful of low-vaccine states, and the delta surge may not have peaked yet. From NPR, I'm Ari Shapiro. It's Thursday, September 2. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)SHAPIRO: It's CONSIDER THIS FROM NPR. So let's compare how hospitals are doing now with how they were doing in the worst days of the winter surge. This was back in early January. Across the country, there were around 120,000 people hospitalized with COVID-19. That number fell throughout the spring and summer to a low of just 12,000 people in early July. But it soared back up over the past two months. And this week, according to the latest data from the CDC, it's around 90,000. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #1: Nearly 100 people are sitting in emergency rooms across Mississippi, waiting for an ICU bed that is not available. SHAPIRO: In Mississippi, hospitals dodged a bullet with Hurricane Ida and did not see major power outages. But ICU beds are still scarce. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #2: The case surge we saw in August most likely will follow us into September. SHAPIRO: In Morehead, Ky. . . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #3: Earlier this week, health care teams expanded to a field hospital in the parking lot to combat the surge in COVID-19 cases. SHAPIRO: The National Guard is helping out at multiple hospitals. Here's what Major Michael Wayne told Spectrum One News. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MICHAEL WAYNE: You know, what has struck my soldiers the most is when they hear over the intercom that there's a medical assistance needed on a COVID floor or there's a medical emergency on a COVID floor. And you know at that time, someone's having difficulty breathing. They're going to be intubated. They're going to be put on a ventilator. And we've heard that five times over the intercom already this morning. SHAPIRO: And in Alabama. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #4: One-thousand six-hundred-thirty-four people in the state are needing COVID ICU care. However, there are only 1,542 staffed ICU beds. That leaves Alabama with an ICU bed capacity of negative-92. SHAPIRO: This week, Alabama became the first state to officially exceed its ICU capacity, according to CDC data. Here's Dr. David Kimberlin again in Birmingham. KIMBERLIN: You remember back in 2020, the emphasis was on preserving the hospital capacity. And it was pretty remarkable what we did as Americans during that time. Well, the sad part - there's a lot of sad parts - but one of the sad parts to where we are right now is that, for all that we went through back then, we're now experiencing the very thing that we've been trying this entire pandemic to avoid. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)SHAPIRO: It's not like hospitals can put a no-vacancy sign on the front door. So what does it mean when they fill up? Well, NPR put that question to two people who run hospitals. AHARON SARELI: We've converted conference rooms and cafeterias, offices, ultrasound rooms, into units that house patients with beds and monitors. SHAPIRO: That's Dr. Aharon Sareli, chief of critical medicine with the Memorial Healthcare System, a large public hospital system in the Miami area. They have space to expand, but space is not the only issue for some hospitals. There's also staffing. ADRIANO GOFFI: Our own nurses are developing COVID symptoms. Vaccinated or not, they pop positive, and they are out of the system for a few days. SHAPIRO: That's Adriano Goffi, a medical director at Altus Lumberton Hospital, a small rural facility east of Houston. Both doctors say the COVID patients in their hospitals are overwhelmingly unvaccinated. They told NPR's Mary Louise Kelly just how hard things are right now and what happens when they don't have room for a patient and no one else does, either. MARY LOUISE KELLY, BYLINE: Dr. Goffi, when you're treating a COVID patient who needs the ICU, who needs a ventilator, and you're calling and no ICU will take them, what is that conversation? Your nurses are calling hospitals all day trying to find a bed, and they say what? GOFFI: Well, as - so we did not have a way to have, like, a waiting list. So we had to hire - we average around five secretaries calling hospital by hospital by hospital, even calling the same ones. It's almost like you just get lucky that a bed opened up and you were on the phone with them. And we're calling thousands of places a day. We've literally air flown somebody from Lumberton to North Dakota to Tennessee, just because those were the only beds available. KELLY: Have you had people die while waiting? GOFFI: Yes, we have. It's very difficult, and it takes a big toll on us, even my family here. Because you come home, and there's no way not to take that home. SARELI: Yeah. I think that's such an important point. The amount of death that health care professionals are seeing on a daily basis is so many orders of magnitude higher than anything we could have ever imagined. Working in critical care, we deal with death on a regular basis, but not in these quantities and not this regularly. And the staff has just been emotionally pulverized, is the only way that I can describe it. KELLY: Emotionally pulverized, yeah. Dr. Goffi? GOFFI: I think that's one of the best ways to put, Dr. Sareli. And you know, the other part, the other component that really is difficult for us as physicians is, as we're caring for these patients, you know, there's the other side, which - these are mostly unvaccinated. You have a lot of vaccinated individuals come into my emergency room, for instance, and they're non-COVID-related issues, such as a heart attack. KELLY: I was going to ask. GOFFI: And. . . KELLY: What does all this mean? If I have a heart attack, and I need to come to your hospital for urgent care. . . GOFFI: Exactly. And that's - and. . . KELLY: . . . There's huge - yeah, please. GOFFI: And it's very difficult for us as physicians because we have a certain amount of things that we pride ourselves, in the United States, of being able to do. You come in with a heart attack, and we can get you the treatment that's lifesaving within 90 minutes. And that's kind of out the window with everything going on now. And now they're waiting three, four or five days. And it's not just the heart attack patients. It's cancer patients that need a biopsy. And I think that's very important to understand, that people need to get vaccinated also to prevent others from having serious complications of other illnesses. KELLY: Is there a discussion underway at either of your hospitals over prioritizing, over, if resources are finite, who deserves the bed? SARELI: Yeah. I think that is a discussion that no physician in a first-world country ever wants to be part of. We are committed to providing care to both our COVID populations and non-COVID populations. And as physicians, we are always going to do the best that we can with the resources at hand. But there is no question that in modern history, health care system in South Florida and I'm sure in the rest of the country has never been under so much pressure for such a long period of time. Our society and all of us have our part to play, and we all have to get vaccinated. Because as you said, there is an impact, not only on the people that have COVID, but on every one of us. Every one of us is going to need health care at some point in our lives. And having the system so overburdened, we are going to pay the price. And we are paying the price. KELLY: Both of you have mentioned the vast majority of the COVID cases coming in are unvaccinated people. What are those conversations like when you see somebody come in, they need urgent care, it's critical, and you think, this was so preventable? SARELI: Yeah. I think from my perspective, you know, the only real word that comes to mind is tragic. It is an absolute tragic conversation to have with patients before they get intubated, when you know it's too late, when you know that they've missed that opportunity not to have had their lives devastated by this virus. And you know that when they land up on mechanical ventilation, the overwhelming chances are that they're going to die. And we then have an intimate relationship with their family members. No one dies in the ICU from COVID in a short period of time. It takes weeks and months. Every day, I speak to their families. I hear their kids in the background. And it's very hard to explain to someone who's not there the magnitude of the tragedy. KELLY: Dr. Goffi? GOFFI: This has probably been the most difficult part of my career. Going through residency and seeing other areas of medicine, like NICU - there's some sad cases there. This one is really tough because I'm not upset with patients because a lot of it is the misinformation that Dr. Sareli is mentioning. It's getting information from all the wrong places. And I think that's the part that hurts the most, is that they feel that they're educated on this subject, and they're not. Because it's coming from Facebook or a variety of avenues that is just not real. SARELI: Can I say one other thing? Can I share one other piece that we didn't get to today? KELLY: Mmm hmm. SARELI: You know, I just wanted to mention that one of the challenges of this last delta wave compared to the last summer, when we were hit by a massive surge as well, is that last summer, everyone seemed to be in the battle against COVID together. Businesses weren't operating. It's almost like the world was holding its breath. And I think one of the challenges with this surge is that if you're in the hospital, if you're a physician, if you're a health caregiver or if you're a patient that is seriously ill or dying from COVID, you're in it, and you're faced with what we've been talking about. But for the rest of the community, if you step outside of even Florida hospitals, life goes on. People are driving around. People are in the streets. People are going on about their lives. And I think that we've almost become numb as a community to what COVID is doing to those patients that chose not to become vaccinated and are now paying the price. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)SHAPIRO: Dr. Aharon Sareli of Memorial Healthcare in South Florida and Dr. Adriano Goffi of Altus Lumberton Hospital in Texas. Finally, there is some good news. Back in mid-July, the U. S. was averaging 500,000 vaccinations per day. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JEFF ZIENTS: Today we're averaging 900,000. SHAPIRO: And crucially, White House COVID coordinator Jeff Zients said this week, the number of people getting their first shot is going up. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)ZIENTS: In August, we got over 14 million. That's almost 4 million more first shots in August compared to the prior month, July. SHAPIRO: For those who still remain unvaccinated, well, this week, the CDC recommended they do not travel this Labor Day weekend. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)SHAPIRO: Earlier this episode, you heard from Dr. David Kimberlin in Alabama. He spoke with NPR science reporter Pien Huang.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #3: Earlier this week, health care teams expanded to a field hospital in the parking lot to combat the surge in COVID-19 cases. SHAPIRO: The National Guard is helping out at multiple hospitals. Here's what Major Michael Wayne told Spectrum One News. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MICHAEL WAYNE: You know, what has struck my soldiers the most is when they hear over the intercom that there's a medical assistance needed on a COVID floor or there's a medical emergency on a COVID floor. And you know at that time, someone's having difficulty breathing. They're going to be intubated. They're going to be put on a ventilator. And we've heard that five times over the intercom already this morning. SHAPIRO: And in Alabama. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #4: One-thousand six-hundred-thirty-four people in the state are needing COVID ICU care. However, there are only 1,542 staffed ICU beds. That leaves Alabama with an ICU bed capacity of negative-92. SHAPIRO: This week, Alabama became the first state to officially exceed its ICU capacity, according to CDC data. Here's Dr. David Kimberlin again in Birmingham. KIMBERLIN: You remember back in 2020, the emphasis was on preserving the hospital capacity. And it was pretty remarkable what we did as Americans during that time. Well, the sad part - there's a lot of sad parts - but one of the sad parts to where we are right now is that, for all that we went through back then, we're now experiencing the very thing that we've been trying this entire pandemic to avoid. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SHAPIRO: It's not like hospitals can put a no-vacancy sign on the front door. So what does it mean when they fill up? Well, NPR put that question to two people who run hospitals. AHARON SARELI: We've converted conference rooms and cafeterias, offices, ultrasound rooms, into units that house patients with beds and monitors. SHAPIRO: That's Dr. Aharon Sareli, chief of critical medicine with the Memorial Healthcare System, a large public hospital system in the Miami area. They have space to expand, but space is not the only issue for some hospitals. There's also staffing. ADRIANO GOFFI: Our own nurses are developing COVID symptoms. Vaccinated or not, they pop positive, and they are out of the system for a few days. SHAPIRO: That's Adriano Goffi, a medical director at Altus Lumberton Hospital, a small rural facility east of Houston. Both doctors say the COVID patients in their hospitals are overwhelmingly unvaccinated. They told NPR's Mary Louise Kelly just how hard things are right now and what happens when they don't have room for a patient and no one else does, either. MARY LOUISE KELLY, BYLINE: Dr. Goffi, when you're treating a COVID patient who needs the ICU, who needs a ventilator, and you're calling and no ICU will take them, what is that conversation? Your nurses are calling hospitals all day trying to find a bed, and they say what? GOFFI: Well, as - so we did not have a way to have, like, a waiting list. So we had to hire - we average around five secretaries calling hospital by hospital by hospital, even calling the same ones. It's almost like you just get lucky that a bed opened up and you were on the phone with them. And we're calling thousands of places a day. We've literally air flown somebody from Lumberton to North Dakota to Tennessee, just because those were the only beds available. KELLY: Have you had people die while waiting? GOFFI: Yes, we have. It's very difficult, and it takes a big toll on us, even my family here. Because you come home, and there's no way not to take that home. SARELI: Yeah. I think that's such an important point. The amount of death that health care professionals are seeing on a daily basis is so many orders of magnitude higher than anything we could have ever imagined. Working in critical care, we deal with death on a regular basis, but not in these quantities and not this regularly. And the staff has just been emotionally pulverized, is the only way that I can describe it. KELLY: Emotionally pulverized, yeah. Dr. Goffi? GOFFI: I think that's one of the best ways to put, Dr. Sareli. And you know, the other part, the other component that really is difficult for us as physicians is, as we're caring for these patients, you know, there's the other side, which - these are mostly unvaccinated. You have a lot of vaccinated individuals come into my emergency room, for instance, and they're non-COVID-related issues, such as a heart attack. KELLY: I was going to ask. GOFFI: And. . . KELLY: What does all this mean? If I have a heart attack, and I need to come to your hospital for urgent care. . . GOFFI: Exactly. And that's - and. . . KELLY: . . . There's huge - yeah, please. GOFFI: And it's very difficult for us as physicians because we have a certain amount of things that we pride ourselves, in the United States, of being able to do. You come in with a heart attack, and we can get you the treatment that's lifesaving within 90 minutes. And that's kind of out the window with everything going on now. And now they're waiting three, four or five days. And it's not just the heart attack patients. It's cancer patients that need a biopsy. And I think that's very important to understand, that people need to get vaccinated also to prevent others from having serious complications of other illnesses. KELLY: Is there a discussion underway at either of your hospitals over prioritizing, over, if resources are finite, who deserves the bed? SARELI: Yeah. I think that is a discussion that no physician in a first-world country ever wants to be part of. We are committed to providing care to both our COVID populations and non-COVID populations. And as physicians, we are always going to do the best that we can with the resources at hand. But there is no question that in modern history, health care system in South Florida and I'm sure in the rest of the country has never been under so much pressure for such a long period of time. Our society and all of us have our part to play, and we all have to get vaccinated. Because as you said, there is an impact, not only on the people that have COVID, but on every one of us. Every one of us is going to need health care at some point in our lives. And having the system so overburdened, we are going to pay the price. And we are paying the price. KELLY: Both of you have mentioned the vast majority of the COVID cases coming in are unvaccinated people. What are those conversations like when you see somebody come in, they need urgent care, it's critical, and you think, this was so preventable? SARELI: Yeah. I think from my perspective, you know, the only real word that comes to mind is tragic. It is an absolute tragic conversation to have with patients before they get intubated, when you know it's too late, when you know that they've missed that opportunity not to have had their lives devastated by this virus. And you know that when they land up on mechanical ventilation, the overwhelming chances are that they're going to die. And we then have an intimate relationship with their family members. No one dies in the ICU from COVID in a short period of time. It takes weeks and months. Every day, I speak to their families. I hear their kids in the background. And it's very hard to explain to someone who's not there the magnitude of the tragedy. KELLY: Dr. Goffi? GOFFI: This has probably been the most difficult part of my career. Going through residency and seeing other areas of medicine, like NICU - there's some sad cases there. This one is really tough because I'm not upset with patients because a lot of it is the misinformation that Dr. Sareli is mentioning. It's getting information from all the wrong places. And I think that's the part that hurts the most, is that they feel that they're educated on this subject, and they're not. Because it's coming from Facebook or a variety of avenues that is just not real. SARELI: Can I say one other thing? Can I share one other piece that we didn't get to today? KELLY: Mmm hmm. SARELI: You know, I just wanted to mention that one of the challenges of this last delta wave compared to the last summer, when we were hit by a massive surge as well, is that last summer, everyone seemed to be in the battle against COVID together. Businesses weren't operating. It's almost like the world was holding its breath. And I think one of the challenges with this surge is that if you're in the hospital, if you're a physician, if you're a health caregiver or if you're a patient that is seriously ill or dying from COVID, you're in it, and you're faced with what we've been talking about. But for the rest of the community, if you step outside of even Florida hospitals, life goes on. People are driving around. People are in the streets. People are going on about their lives. And I think that we've almost become numb as a community to what COVID is doing to those patients that chose not to become vaccinated and are now paying the price. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) SHAPIRO: Dr. Aharon Sareli of Memorial Healthcare in South Florida and Dr. Adriano Goffi of Altus Lumberton Hospital in Texas. Finally, there is some good news. Back in mid-July, the U. S. was averaging 500,000 vaccinations per day. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JEFF ZIENTS: Today we're averaging 900,000. SHAPIRO: And crucially, White House COVID coordinator Jeff Zients said this week, the number of people getting their first shot is going up. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ZIENTS: In August, we got over 14 million. That's almost 4 million more first shots in August compared to the prior month, July. SHAPIRO: For those who still remain unvaccinated, well, this week, the CDC recommended they do not travel this Labor Day weekend.

The water also shut down much of the city's subway system. Heavy rain from climate change is driving more flooding in subways around the world. NPR's Rebecca Hersher reports cities are racing to adapt their subways to a hotter, rainier Earth. REBECCA HERSHER, BYLINE: The water gushed into subway stations across New York very early Thursday morning. (SOUNDBITE OF WATER POURING)HERSHER: One video shot by a passenger in a station in Manhattan showed a sheet of water cascading onto an arriving train. This is not new. Dozens of cities around the world have struggled with flooded subways in recent years. And preventing floods starts with predicting where and when they'll happen, which can be harder than it looks. NICHOLAS BONARD: So here we are on Connecticut Avenue. It's one of the thoroughfares of the city. HERSHER: Nicholas Bonard works for the Washington, D. C. , Department of Energy and Environment. We're standing outside a subway station next to a shopping center. BONARD: There's CVS. There's restaurants. There's banks. HERSHER: There's no water in sight. We're miles from any major river. But there's a slight hill in each direction. BONARD: So if you imagine a drop of rain falling on the street, you know, which way does it go? And it starts to go downhill. And so a drop of rain that goes a block north, that starts to come here. And a drop of rain that goes a block south, that starts to come here, too. HERSHER: And if a lot of rain falls in a short period of time - the kind of heavy rain that's getting more common as the Earth heats up - all those drops overwhelm the drainage pipes, and water starts pooling on the street, on the sidewalk. And from there, it naturally flows down into the air vents, the stairs and the escalator for the underground subway station. And if I'm at the bottom of the stairs, what do I see? BONARD: What you would see is - you would see a waterfall coming down the stairs. HERSHER: That is exactly what happened here in 2016. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: Multiple rounds of storms have dumped inches of rain on Washington, D. C. , causing flooding in some areas. HERSHER: Water poured into the station. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: The Cleveland Park station absolutely flooded. Look at that. HERSHER: Now, even on a sunny day, there are sandbags outside the station entrance ready to be stacked up if there's a rainstorm. But that's a short-term fix. The bigger fixes are more expensive and time consuming. Bonard's office is working on a flood model that could help predict where this type of flooding is most likely to happen in the city. The Transit Authority is spending millions of dollars waterproofing leaky tunnels, keeping water out of vents and station entrances, upgrading emergency warnings. It's urgent work. Extreme weather this summer made it clear how urgent. Heavy rain disrupted subway service in both New York and Boston. And in July, heavy rain trapped people in a subway in central China. Harrowing videos showed passengers struggling to breathe a shrinking pocket of air. SLOBODAN DJORDJEVIC: I just never saw images of people running out of air in underground trains because of water levels rising - very horrifying. HERSHER: Slobodan Djordjevic studies underground rail flooding at the University of Exeter in the U. K. What happened in China underscored how even modern subways can be overwhelmed by climate-driven rain. DJORDJEVIC: Every city should have a comprehensive review of flood risk for the underground system. HERSHER: Flooding is so frequent and so severe in many parts of Asia that a lot of cities there are ahead of the curve, he says. They've been thinking about this problem for decades. DJORDJEVIC: There is a lot to learn from Asian cities' ways of dealing with flooding of underground trains. HERSHER: For example, many stations and air vents in Taipei are raised slightly to keep the water out. That's an upgrade that many cities in the U. S. and Europe are also working on. And while updating old subways is expensive, it's crucial. Safe, reliable mass transit helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions so floods don't keep getting worse. Rebecca Hersher, NPR News.

Now, people noticed the spill after Hurricane Ida swept through an oil and gas hub there. Images taken last week showed a rainbow sheen on the water and a dark, thick line suggesting an ongoing spill. Joining us now to talk about these images and what we know so far is Oscar Garcia-Pineda. He's a geoscientist at Water Mapping. Welcome to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. OSCAR GARCIA-PINEDA: Thank you. CORNISH: Divers have located this dislodged pipeline in the Gulf that may be feeding this particular spill. But so far, do you get the sense that this is a problem with a single source? This was a huge hub, right? We're talking many, many, many platforms of oil and gas refineries. GARCIA-PINEDA: That is correct, yes. So that's the problem. When we see a satellite image and we see the oil exploration on the surface of the ocean, that's an indication that, obviously, there could be an active spill coming from either a structure or the seafloor. In the case that you are referring, there is no structures connected to this field or to the slick. So that's why there has to be investigations. And the evaluation of the damage normally takes place. And we have to just keep monitoring to see the magnitude of the problem. The number of pipelines across the area is incredible. This is literally hundreds of kilometers of pipelines all over the place. So detecting the oil on the seafloor is very challenging. It could be - it could take days. CORNISH: How does this compare to, say, a storm like Hurricane Ivan - right? - which also caused this massive spill? I think that was back in 2004. GARCIA-PINEDA: Well, that's too early to say or to compare. Right now, we are looking into every single one of these small spills. And if there is any indication that there could be a significant spill that could be persistent, then, obviously, we want to make sure that doesn't happen again. However, the strength of the hurricane was probably as much as Ivan, and it passed in a very close proximity to the location of the Ivan path. So I think, I mean, honestly, I think that we can see a change on the way the oil industry responds to or prepare to these situation, because what happened on Ivan is that destroyed oil platforms by mudslides, et cetera. And in this case, I mean, we haven't seen that level of damage. We want - we just wanted to make sure that the spills that we see could be under control rapidly. CORNISH: So the oil and gas companies are using data - right? - from your company to monitor and understand what's going on. At the same time, it's clear that climate change is fueling larger and more powerful hurricanes, right? This is what the research is showing. So are they being proactive about the safety of these oil rigs? Is there a sense of urgency? GARCIA-PINEDA: In terms of the planning for safety, for responding to or preventing a spill, I believe so. I have to say that it's not only the oil industry. I think the federal agencies have imposed stronger regulation that will prevent from anything to happen. And that's why I believe is why we haven't seen anything since Ivan. CORNISH: What are you going to be looking for in the next couple of days in terms of getting closer to the source of the spill? GARCIA-PINEDA: Well, there is no doubt on the next days the monitoring is going to continue to be as intense as possible on the field from airplanes, from satellites. And we will continue to keep an eye on - particularly on those spills where we identified already and to make sure that if they are persistent, if they are going to be active, then, you know, we're going to make sure that those could be contained.

Close your doors. Shut your windows. Stay indoors. But as NPR's Nathan Rott reports, new research shows that may not be enough to keep you safe. NATHAN ROTT, BYLINE: When you hear about hazardous air pollution, it's often based off of the measurement that's taken outside. That's where most air monitors are. But people, you and me - we spend roughly three-quarters of our time inside, says researcher Marshall Burke. MARSHALL BURKE: And so what matters from an exposure perspective, then, is not what's happening outside but, really, what's happening inside. ROTT: Burke lives in the Bay Area and is an Earth system scientist at Stanford University. But this really didn't hit home for him until last year, when the nation was under stay-at-home orders and huge swaths of the West, Bay Area included, were socked in suffocating wildfire smoke. BURKE: And I have young kids, one who is asthmatic, and so I'm really, really worried and thinking about what those exposures look like. ROTT: So he bought a low-cost PurpleAir monitor for inside his home. BURKE: And our indoor pollution was sky-high during these wildfire events. ROTT: Oftentimes the air inside was just as bad as it was out, no matter how many windows you shut. PurpleAir monitors allow users like Burke to post their data publicly online, almost like an exercise app. BURKE: Yeah, it's like the Strava for air pollution, basically. ROTT: So being a researcher, he went through all of the data and found that bad air was the case in households across the smoke-covered West. His research is scheduled to pre-publish soon. And while it hasn't yet been peer-reviewed, his findings are consistent with what others are seeing. Another study scheduled to publish later this year by the Environmental Protection Agency looked at air quality in western Montana during wildfire smoke events with a focus on the types of buildings that public health officials would usually recommend that at-risk people go to. SARAH COEFIELD: We would say, you know, hey; if it's smoky outside, go to the library. ROTT: This is Sarah Coefield, an air quality specialist in Missoula, Mont. , who's helping with the study. And she says of the schools, daycares, businesses and other publicly accessible places they looked at. . . COEFIELD: We did not have a single building with air that was, like, significantly better than outside. Some of the buildings, you might as well have been outside. ROTT: Last year at least 1 in 7 Americans experienced dangerous air quality from wildfire smoke alone; this year, tens of millions more, including people hundreds of miles away from the fires. So this new research has major implications for public health officials like Sarah Coefield, who's now pushing. . . COEFIELD: To have the public messaging during a smoke event change from, go inside, to, go inside and clean your air. ROTT: Filter it. Remove the fine particulate matter that drifts through windows and doors and so deep into your bloodstream that it can trigger cardiac events. MASON DOW: And some filters, so. . . ROTT: That's why Mason Dow is at the food bank in Missoula, Mont. , handing out box fans with air filters duct taped to them. DOW: So this is a self-contained air filtration system, so tight seal on, like, doors and windows and stuff, middle of the room. And it filters the air pretty darn well. ROTT: Fancy air filters can cost hundreds of dollars. And for a lot of people, like 67-year-old Janet Friede, who's been sick from the wildfire smoke this summer, that kind of money isn't just laying around. So she says outside, she's just been dealing with the smoke. JANET FRIEDE: It makes me have a headache and stuff and tired, real tired. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Filters on the back. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Yeah. ROTT: She's not alone. As people come through the food bank, grabbing these free DIY air filters, they mention sore throats, kids with asthma, headaches like Friede's. Forty fans are gone in 20 minutes. AMY CILIMBURG: It feels a little bit maybe like a Band-Aid. ROTT: Amy Cilimburg is the director of Climate Smart Missoula, the small nonprofit that's providing these air filters. Cilimburg says this work is a reflection of the reality. Climate change is here. It's happening. CILIMBURG: The reason we're doing this is because we have longer, hotter, drier, smokier summers. ROTT: So we need to adapt, she says, not down the road but right now. Nathan Rott, NPR News, Missoula, Mont. (SOUNDBITE OF KINOBE'S \"CELESTION\") MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:   For the millions of Americans dealing with wildfire smoke this summer, public health officials have a simple message. Close your doors. Shut your windows. Stay indoors. But as NPR's Nathan Rott reports, new research shows that may not be enough to keep you safe. NATHAN ROTT, BYLINE: When you hear about hazardous air pollution, it's often based off of the measurement that's taken outside. That's where most air monitors are. But people, you and me - we spend roughly three-quarters of our time inside, says researcher Marshall Burke. MARSHALL BURKE: And so what matters from an exposure perspective, then, is not what's happening outside but, really, what's happening inside. ROTT: Burke lives in the Bay Area and is an Earth system scientist at Stanford University. But this really didn't hit home for him until last year, when the nation was under stay-at-home orders and huge swaths of the West, Bay Area included, were socked in suffocating wildfire smoke. BURKE: And I have young kids, one who is asthmatic, and so I'm really, really worried and thinking about what those exposures look like. ROTT: So he bought a low-cost PurpleAir monitor for inside his home. BURKE: And our indoor pollution was sky-high during these wildfire events. ROTT: Oftentimes the air inside was just as bad as it was out, no matter how many windows you shut. PurpleAir monitors allow users like Burke to post their data publicly online, almost like an exercise app. BURKE: Yeah, it's like the Strava for air pollution, basically. ROTT: So being a researcher, he went through all of the data and found that bad air was the case in households across the smoke-covered West. His research is scheduled to pre-publish soon. And while it hasn't yet been peer-reviewed, his findings are consistent with what others are seeing. Another study scheduled to publish later this year by the Environmental Protection Agency looked at air quality in western Montana during wildfire smoke events with a focus on the types of buildings that public health officials would usually recommend that at-risk people go to. SARAH COEFIELD: We would say, you know, hey; if it's smoky outside, go to the library. ROTT: This is Sarah Coefield, an air quality specialist in Missoula, Mont. , who's helping with the study.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: My message to unvaccinated Americans is this. What more is there to wait for? What more do you need to see? KELLY: He said his patience was wearing thin. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BIDEN: We've made vaccinations free, safe and convenient. The vaccine has FDA approval. Over 200 million Americans have gotten at least one shot. KELLY: Biden announced that through the Labor Department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration - that's OSHA - that the federal government would require employers with more than 100 employees either to ensure their workers get vaccinated or do weekly testing. The new rule would impact about 80 million workers. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BIDEN: Some of the biggest companies are already requiring this - United Airlines, Disney, Tyson's Food (ph) and even Fox News. KELLY: As expected, Republicans are calling this an overreach. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)RON DESANTIS: He's saying he's losing patience with people. You know, at the end of the day, we don't live with a one-person rule in this country. KELLY: Florida Governor Ron DeSantis speaking last Friday. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)DESANTIS: I mean, just think about, you know, what this mandate would do. It's going to drive people out of work, out of hospitals, out of all this stuff. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"MEET THE PRESS\")ASA HUTCHINSON: This is a very serious deadly virus, and we're all together in trying to get an increased level of vaccination out in the population. KELLY: Speaking on NBC's \"Meet The Press,\" Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson said a mandate like this will actually make it harder to convince people in his state to get the vaccine. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"MEET THE PRESS\")HUTCHINSON: The problem is that I'm trying to overcome resistance, but the president's actions and a mandate hardens the resistance. KELLY: And yet many health officials are saying it's about time. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)ZEKE EMANUEL: Way back when in - April 14, I began calling for a mandate, especially among health care workers, the Defense Department and others. KELLY: Former White House COVID 19 adviser Dr. Zeke Emanuel. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)EMANUEL: And I think the president is slowly leading the country to accept the mandates. KELLY: CONSIDER THIS - it's clear that unvaccinated Americans need more incentive than rising case numbers and death counts. But will a federal mandate convince them? And how will it work? Coming up, we'll hear more from Zeke Emanuel and business leaders about how they see this playing out. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)KELLY: From NPR, I'm Mary Louise Kelly. It's Monday, September 13. It's CONSIDER THIS FROM NPR. In a letter published Monday morning, a trade group that represents large companies including Coca-Cola and Campbell's Soup had some follow-up questions for the White House following the new vaccine mandate. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)GEOFF FREEMAN: What is considered documentation for proof of vaccination? Must an employee be fully vaccinated in order to work? Is there a single testing standard? KELLY: That's Geoff Freeman, president and CEO of the Consumer Brands Association. He told NPR that while he supports measures to increase vaccinations, he's worried about it happening in a haphazard way. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)FREEMAN: We can't have the federal government hand this off to the private sector and say, now it's your responsibility. No. We need a federal government that is getting us immediate answers, that is a partner and working through these complicated situations. KELLY: Situations like if the federal mandate requires vaccination or weekly COVID testing, who pays for the tests? (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)FREEMAN: We don't know what the cost is here. We don't know who's expected to pick up that cost. KELLY: Even with this laundry list of questions, Freeman says there is one clear positive right away. It means this decision of whether to institute a mandate is taken out of employers' hands, which he says makes for a level playing field. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)FREEMAN: There is upside to the federal government's engagement, but that benefit is lost if there's confusion and anxiety. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)KELLY: Employers have a lot of questions. Republicans are pushing back. But Dr. Zeke Emanuel says a mandate like this was really the only choice Biden had. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)EMANUEL: He tried to persuade people to get it. But we know voluntary efforts like this aren't going to get enough and that mandates are going to be necessary. KELLY: Emanuel is the vice provost for global initiatives at the University of Pennsylvania and a former member of President Biden's Transition COVID-19 Advisory Board. He spoke with NPR's Michel Martin on Sunday. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)EMANUEL: We know that if we need 80% of the population to do something, it won't happen voluntarily. Even in our most just wars that all the country is mobilized for, you still need a draft. Voluntary things will get you so far. And we've seen about 50% of the population - 54% of the population now, through a voluntary effort, has gotten vaccinated. And we're going up ever so slowly. You're going to need mandates, something more forceful, to persuade all the people we needed to adopt the vaccine to actually get it. And I think that President Biden has slowly led the country to realize that. MICHEL MARTIN: So the president's mandate potentially covers about 100 million Americans, so about a third of the country's total population. What impact do you think this will have on efforts to bring the pandemic under control? EMANUEL: First of all, we do know that mandates work. When Houston Methodist Hospital mandated its 26,000 thousand workers, there was a lot of pushback, a lot of noise about that. But in the end, only 127 or -37 of 26,000 employees decided they weren't going to get vaccinated and would prefer to quit. So mandates work. And that, I think, is going to make a big difference. MARTIN: As we mentioned, the president's executive order also covers private sector employees. Now, as you - you know, some business organizations and trade groups have already been supportive of this mandate. But already, many Republicans are reacting furiously. They have called it a tyranny. And this includes even some people like Ohio Governor Mike DeWine, who is not among those who've downplayed the virus or resisted other measures. He's taken some strong measures, but even he's called this a mistake, saying people and business owners should make their own decisions about vaccination. So what do you say to that? EMANUEL: Well, you know, our founders understood that if every individual made decisions that would lead to - on something important, nationally important - that would lead to chaos. You couldn't have individual freedom on things that affected everyone. They believe in ordered liberty, and ordered liberty requires certain rules where your action impacts others. That's, in this country, why we have driver's license, why we say you can't go into a store without shoes and a shirt on - so that we actually protect each other. This notion that freedom allows me to do whatever I want is something our Founding Fathers would totally reject. That is not their understanding of freedom. Freedom is ordered liberty. And part of ordered liberty is where we impact other people, like infectious diseases, we have to actually all act together. And they would think this is perfectly consistent with freedom. And I think the president and most of the American population agrees with that. There's going to be a small group that doesn't, and that's the people who we actually need to abide by this mandate. MARTIN: So before we let you go, as we are speaking now, cumulatively, U. S. COVID deaths are numbering more than 660,000 and with about 1,500 people dying per day at the moment. Although the seven-day cumulative average seems to be going down, is that where you thought we'd be by now? EMANUEL: No. I had - you know, way back in March 2020, I said, you know, we'll probably get back to normalcy in November 2021. And I was considered a real bad pessimist then. And what I didn't anticipate was delta. I think it was hard for anyone to anticipate how infectious and deadly something like delta could be. And second, I didn't anticipate how resistant a portion of the public would be to vaccination. And now it looks like, you know, we're talking about spring 2022. And that assumes that we have more mandates. I also might say, Michel, one of the things I'm very nervous about at the moment is looking forward to Thanksgiving and Christmas. We remember from 2020, we had a big surge around Thanksgiving, and that declined only a little bit, and then a big surge around Christmas because of travel. I am very nervous that with people wanting to travel more, wanting to see family, if we don't get that vaccination rate up very rapidly in the very short period of time, we could have another double surge. That would be, I think, quite, quite problematic for the country with a very high death rate. And the only way to prevent that, I think, is mandating vaccination before any air travel, interstate trains, interstate buses. You know, frankly, you need six weeks before Thanksgiving to make that effective because you need two shots, and you need two weeks after the second shot to really be fully vaccinated. So we got to start now. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)KELLY: Dr. Zeke Emanuel, former COVID-19 adviser for the Biden administration. You're listening to CONSIDER THIS FROM NPR. I'm Mary Louise Kelly.

At the same time, the federal government is spending millions of dollars to move people out of flood zones. Rebecca Hersher from NPR's climate team is here. Rebecca, we're talking about the U. S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, HUD. What did your investigation find? REBECCA HERSHER, BYLINE: Well, HUD is mainly known for subsidized rental housing, but HUD also sells homes. And we found that thousands of those homes around the country are located in flood zones, and the people who buy them generally don't get any information about flood risk until after they've decided to buy. And that raises a lot of questions about how HUD is dealing with climate change. You know, climate change has caused residential flood damage in the U. S. to skyrocket. HUD's mission is to provide safe, affordable housing. So HUD says it's important to sell these homes for low prices and make sure they don't sit vacant. But many of the housing experts we spoke with said it's very concerning that HUD would be selling homes that are prone to flooding and basically allowing families to move into harm's way. MART\u00cdNEZ: Where are these homes located? You said they were all around the U. S. Any particular hotspots? HERSHER: Yes. So I should say, these are houses that were foreclosed on by banks and then handed over to HUD to be sold. And NPR analyzed data from 2017 to 2020. It's nearly 100,000 homes that HUD sold. And in that time, HUD sold flood-prone houses in almost every state, but there were hotspots, as you said. So Louisiana, Florida and New Jersey all stuck out. A larger proportion of the homes that HUD sold in those states were in flood zones. MART\u00cdNEZ: Now, those states are on the coast. Maybe they're just maybe prone to more flooding in general? HERSHER: Right. We wondered that, too. But we found that HUD is selling a disproportionate number of homes in flood zones. So, for example, in Louisiana, about 20% of homes sold by HUD were in flood zones. That's compared to just 0. 1% of all homes sold in that period in Louisiana. So the data really suggests that the homes HUD is selling are more prone to flooding than the general housing stock. MART\u00cdNEZ: Then what does it mean for people who end up buying these homes? Because there's a affordable housing shortage happening all over the nation right now - so I got to think these homes are very attractive to some of these families. HERSHER: Yeah, absolutely. And we interviewed people who bought these houses in multiple states who are basically gambling that the house won't flood while they live there. And that brings us to another question, which environmental justice experts have raised. You know, is HUD doing enough to protect low-income families from the effects of climate change? You know, buying a house is a way to build generational wealth in the U. S. People put their life savings into their homes, and a flood can wipe that out. My colleague Tegan Wendland of member station WWNO visited a family in Louisiana who purchased one of these homes, and it was their dream house. TEGAN WENDLAND, BYLINE: Jonathan Stewman grew up in an apartment building in Baton Rouge. It was small, had no yard. He always dreamed of owning his own home. JONATHAN STEWMAN: I never knew what it was like to stay in a house. So when I moved in here, you know, it felt like home immediately. WENDLAND: He and his wife bought their little white house on a quiet side street in Denham Springs, La. , in the spring of 2019. And they love it. It has a big backyard. STEWMAN: That's one of the things that attracted me to it is the backyard. It's a pretty nice size for the kids, and they like to have fun. WENDLAND: Little rocking chairs with the kids' names sit on the front porch, Jaden (ph) and Jayla (ph). They ride four-wheelers. He's building the kids a big backyard playset. He says they bought the house for $111,000 from HUD. And like many folks who purchase these homes, Stewman doesn't make a lot of money. He works overnights at a local chemical plant. STEWMAN: Yeah, I got a good deal on it. WENDLAND: The catch - it's in a flood plain. In 2016, a massive climate-driven storm flooded the house with 2 feet of water, and it's raised up about a foot off the ground. Stewman wants to raise it higher but needs to save enough money first. And are you worried about flooding now? STEWMAN: No, I'm not too concerned about it. You know, if it happens, it happens. But for right now, I'm just going to enjoy my time. WENDLAND: They have flood insurance, but they're still in a precarious situation, just hundreds of feet away from the Amite River, which runs right through town and jumped its banks in 2016, flooding thousands of homes. The weird thing is the state has a program to get people out of this area. It's buying out homes right near Stewman's in order to prevent future flooding. I showed a map of those Louisiana HUD homes to Pat Forbes, head of the state agency that oversees those home buyouts. And as you can see, there's a lot concentrated in areas that flooded pretty bad during the 2016 floods. PAT FORBES: Wow. WENDLAND: After every flood, the state's making tough decisions about whether certain areas are just too dangerous to live in. Hundreds of homes have been bought out to be demolished and to return the land to nature. Forbes had never heard of the HUD HOME Program. FORBES: Yeah, that's surprising, knowing what I know about HUD's rules and how focused they are on keeping people out of harm's way. WENDLAND: Stewman knows the risk he faces. But every time it rains, he and his family hunker down, hold their breath and hope that the water doesn't rise too high. For NPR News, I'm Tegan Wendland in Denham Springs, La. MART\u00cdNEZ: All right. So that's the view from Louisiana, and it sounds like state officials are frustrated that HUD is selling flood-prone homes. What is HUD's response? HERSHER: So HUD did not respond to questions about how it works with state governments. And I should say, we heard similar frustration from officials in New Jersey and in Virginia. They were surprised and alarmed. A HUD spokesperson, Michael Burns, told NPR that the agency recognizes that climate-driven flooding is a problem for housing in general and that, quote, \"ensuring that federal agencies, including HUD, have the right tools and policies in place to increase resilience nationwide is a key priority of the Biden-Harris administration. \"MART\u00cdNEZ: Rebecca, what are some potential solutions? HERSHER: So there are a few options that housing experts and homeowners themselves mentioned. First, HUD could disclose flood risk earlier and more fully - you know, put flood risk right on the main listing page - and explain, how likely is it that water will enter into the house? How much water? Second, give information upfront about the cost of flood insurance. It can be really pricey, and it doesn't always cover all the damage. And third, do more to make homes safe from flooding before HUD sells them. So, for example, lift foundations or automatically give grants to buyers so they can do that kind of work themselves. And HUD says it's studying the overall risks of climate change, including flooding, but didn't provide any more details. MART\u00cdNEZ: That's Rebecca Hersher from NPR's climate team. Rebecca, thanks. HERSHER: Thanks so much.

NICOLE NIXON, BYLINE: Good morning. KING: So unofficial results show that almost 2/3 of voters in California chose to keep Newsom in his job. What did the governor have to say about that outcome? NIXON: Yeah, the governor said he was humbled by the results. And he said that by rejecting the recall, he believes Californians were also saying yes to the coronavirus vaccine, to voting rights and a bunch of other issues that came up in this election. Here he is talking to reporters last night. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)GAVIN NEWSOM: We said yes to all those things that we hold dear as Californians, and I would argue, as Americans - economic justice, social justice, racial justice, environmental justice, our values, where California's made so much progress. All of those things were on the ballot. NIXON: But the governor said he was still concerned by claims from Republicans, including former President Donald Trump, that the election would be rigged, and he's concerned that these unsubstantiated election fraud claims are still coming up. KING: The leading Republican contender was the conservative radio host, a man named Larry Elder. What did he say about the results? NIXON: Well, Larry Elder previously did not commit to accepting the election results. But he did do that last night. He conceded the race. He even told his supporters that they should be gracious in defeat, though some of those supporters weren't too happy to hear that. And Elder also left the door open to another potential challenge against Newsom, who's up for reelection next year. KING: How did the pandemic play into this recall election from the beginning? NIXON: Yeah. Well, the recall was filed in early 2020 before the pandemic, but it quickly became about that. Newsom's critics didn't like his tough business restrictions, and he took heat because schools were closed for a full year. And Republicans tried to make this recall a referendum on Gavin Newsom, but Gavin Newsom tried to make it a referendum on Trumpism. And he tied it to national fights over things like reproductive rights and voting rights, and he was able to bring in support from President Joe Biden and other national Democrats to help boost that message. And Democratic voters outnumber Republicans almost two to one in California, and the early results from this recall reflect that. So there aren't too many surprises here. KING: Do you think Gavin Newsom will run again in 2022? NIXON: Newsom did not talk about 2022. But it is expected he will run again, and his allies say that this victory puts him in a strong position going into next year. One thing we've been hearing from progressive voters is that some of them aren't enthralled by Newsom as a governor, and they only voted for him in the recall to avoid a Republican governor. So it'll be interesting to see if he fields a viable challenger from his left next year. KING: Nicole Nixon of CapRadio in Sacramento. Thanks, Nicole. NIXON: Thank you.

The $10 billion James Webb Space Telescope is scheduled to launch in December. It's a successor to Hubble. Here's NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE, BYLINE: Hubble launched into space over three decades ago in 1990. The first images it sent back were unexpectedly fuzzy. Its mirror turned out to have a tiny flaw. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JOHNNY CARSON: Have you heard about the problems with the Hubble Space Telescope? GREENFIELDBOYCE: The Hubble trouble made this telescope a household name and fodder for comedians like Johnny Carson. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)CARSON: And they call the NASA official repairman to fix it. And he said he'll be up there sometime in the 21st century between noon and 5. (LAUGHTER)GREENFIELDBOYCE: It was actually just a few years later that astronauts went up and fixed Hubble. What Hubble saw then was mind-blowing. Robert Hurt is an astronomer with Caltech. He remembers being at a science conference when some of Hubble's first images were unveiled. ROBERT HURT: It was like being at a rock concert. I mean, people were cheering. GREENFIELDBOYCE: He says before Hubble, big telescopes on the ground had to look up through the Earth's turbulent atmosphere. HURT: An atmosphere has a distorting effect on light as it comes through. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Hubble was above all that. Its perch in space gave it crisp, clear, detailed views. Familiar stars and clouds of gas were suddenly transformed into gorgeous, glowing visions that got names like the Pillars of Creation. Those celestial scenes became iconic. JANE RIGBY: I think Hubble certainly is the first telescope where the images appeared everywhere. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Jane Rigby is a NASA astronomer. RIGBY: I have socks with Hubble pictures on them. I've seen them on the sides of a U-Haul going down the highway. GREENFIELDBOYCE: They're on kids' lunchboxes, coffee mugs, T-shirts. RIGBY: And they hit us in a kind of awe-inspiring, connected to everything, maybe spiritual way. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Now NASA is getting ready to launch a new space telescope named after a former agency administrator, James Webb. It's been in the works for about as long as Hubble has been in orbit. Rigby says the huge James Webb Telescope will be all folded up inside its rocket and will unfurl out in space. RIGBY: So it's either a transformer or it's origami, depending on whether you like pop culture or arts and crafts. GREENFIELDBOYCE: And hopefully, all of this will go without a hitch because no repairs are possible this time. The telescope will travel to a lonely spot about a million miles away from Earth to look farther out than we've ever seen before. Light takes time to travel through space. And Rigby says Webb will be able to capture light that's been traveling for almost the entire history of the universe. RIGBY: Where we'll be able to see galaxies as they looked a couple hundred million years after the big bang. GREENFIELDBOYCE: This telescope will be able to do other amazing stuff, too, like study the atmospheres of planets in other solar systems. But here's the question. RIGBY: Will Webb images look as gorgeous as Hubble images, right? Will we love them not just as scientifically valuable, but are they going to knock our socks off? GREENFIELDBOYCE: She thinks the answer is yes. In fact, she says the James Webb team has a top-secret plan for what pictures to release to the public first. She says these are images. . . RIGBY: That are intended to be jaw droppingly beautiful, powerful both visually and scientifically. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Hubble detects mostly optical wavelengths of light. That's the kind of light our eyes can see. James Webb was built to see the universe in infrared. Infrared light is normally invisible to us. But it is better at seeing older, colder objects. It also can see through dust. Nikole Lewis is an astronomer at Cornell University. NIKOLE LEWIS: A lot of those iconic Hubble images are because you're seeing dust scatter light all over the place, which is beautiful. But it makes it really hard to study the stuff that's inside. GREENFIELDBOYCE: She says there will be a bit of artistic license in deciding how to assign colors that our eyes can see to the various wavelengths of infrared light. But then there's always been a certain amount of artistry in Hubble images, too. Hubble's cameras sent back black-and-white pictures. Vivid colors are added later. Lisa Storrie-Lombardi is an astronomer at the Las Cumbres Observatory. She expects that James Webb will produce its own iconic images. LISA STORRIE-LOMBARDI: It's going to take magnificent images in the infrared. So they'll just be in a different wavelength of light. But they will be beautiful. GREENFIELDBOYCE: She served as the project manager for Spitzer, a different space telescope that saw in infrared. It was smaller and less powerful than James Webb will be. Still, it produced plenty of stunning pictures. STORRIE-LOMBARDI: I knew Spitzer had really, you know, hit the big time when CNN posted one of our images in the first year of the mission and called it a Hubble image (laughter). GREENFIELDBOYCE: Because for the public, Hubble has been the gold standard for cosmic eye candy. And soon, the world will see how images from the James Webb Space Telescope measure up. Nell Greenfieldboyce, NPR News. NOEL KING, HOST:   NASA is close to giving us a new view of the universe. The $10 billion James Webb Space Telescope is scheduled to launch in December. It's a successor to Hubble. Here's NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE, BYLINE: Hubble launched into space over three decades ago in 1990. The first images it sent back were unexpectedly fuzzy. Its mirror turned out to have a tiny flaw. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JOHNNY CARSON: Have you heard about the problems with the Hubble Space Telescope? GREENFIELDBOYCE: The Hubble trouble made this telescope a household name and fodder for comedians like Johnny Carson. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CARSON: And they call the NASA official repairman to fix it. And he said he'll be up there sometime in the 21st century between noon and 5. (LAUGHTER) GREENFIELDBOYCE: It was actually just a few years later that astronauts went up and fixed Hubble. What Hubble saw then was mind-blowing. Robert Hurt is an astronomer with Caltech. He remembers being at a science conference when some of Hubble's first images were unveiled. ROBERT HURT: It was like being at a rock concert. I mean, people were cheering. GREENFIELDBOYCE: He says before Hubble, big telescopes on the ground had to look up through the Earth's turbulent atmosphere. HURT: An atmosphere has a distorting effect on light as it comes through. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Hubble was above all that. Its perch in space gave it crisp, clear, detailed views. Familiar stars and clouds of gas were suddenly transformed into gorgeous, glowing visions that got names like the Pillars of Creation. Those celestial scenes became iconic. JANE RIGBY: I think Hubble certainly is the first telescope where the images appeared everywhere. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Jane Rigby is a NASA astronomer. RIGBY: I have socks with Hubble pictures on them. I've seen them on the sides of a U-Haul going down the highway. GREENFIELDBOYCE: They're on kids' lunchboxes, coffee mugs, T-shirts. RIGBY: And they hit us in a kind of awe-inspiring, connected to everything, maybe spiritual way. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Now NASA is getting ready to launch a new space telescope named after a former agency administrator, James Webb. It's been in the works for about as long as Hubble has been in orbit. Rigby says the huge James Webb Telescope will be all folded up inside its rocket and will unfurl out in space. RIGBY: So it's either a transformer or it's origami, depending on whether you like pop culture or arts and crafts. GREENFIELDBOYCE: And hopefully, all of this will go without a hitch because no repairs are possible this time. The telescope will travel to a lonely spot about a million miles away from Earth to look farther out than we've ever seen before. Light takes time to travel through space. And Rigby says Webb will be able to capture light that's been traveling for almost the entire history of the universe. RIGBY: Where we'll be able to see galaxies as they looked a couple hundred million years after the big bang. GREENFIELDBOYCE: This telescope will be able to do other amazing stuff, too, like study the atmospheres of planets in other solar systems. But here's the question. RIGBY: Will Webb images look as gorgeous as Hubble images, right? Will we love them not just as scientifically valuable, but are they going to knock our socks off? GREENFIELDBOYCE: She thinks the answer is yes. In fact, she says the James Webb team has a top-secret plan for what pictures to release to the public first. She says these are images. . . RIGBY: That are intended to be jaw droppingly beautiful, powerful both visually and scientifically. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Hubble detects mostly optical wavelengths of light. That's the kind of light our eyes can see. James Webb was built to see the universe in infrared. Infrared light is normally invisible to us. But it is better at seeing older, colder objects. It also can see through dust. Nikole Lewis is an astronomer at Cornell University. NIKOLE LEWIS: A lot of those iconic Hubble images are because you're seeing dust scatter light all over the place, which is beautiful. But it makes it really hard to study the stuff that's inside. GREENFIELDBOYCE: She says there will be a bit of artistic license in deciding how to assign colors that our eyes can see to the various wavelengths of infrared light. But then there's always been a certain amount of artistry in Hubble images, too. Hubble's cameras sent back black-and-white pictures. Vivid colors are added later. Lisa Storrie-Lombardi is an astronomer at the Las Cumbres Observatory. She expects that James Webb will produce its own iconic images. LISA STORRIE-LOMBARDI: It's going to take magnificent images in the infrared. So they'll just be in a different wavelength of light. But they will be beautiful. GREENFIELDBOYCE: She served as the project manager for Spitzer, a different space telescope that saw in infrared. It was smaller and less powerful than James Webb will be. Still, it produced plenty of stunning pictures. STORRIE-LOMBARDI: I knew Spitzer had really, you know, hit the big time when CNN posted one of our images in the first year of the mission and called it a Hubble image (laughter). GREENFIELDBOYCE: Because for the public, Hubble has been the gold standard for cosmic eye candy. And soon, the world will see how images from the James Webb Space Telescope measure up.

ANTHONY FAUCI: The advisory committee felt that at this particular time, there wasn't enough data to allow the booster recommendation for everyone. SHAPIRO: That's Dr. Anthony Fauci, President Biden's chief medical adviser. FAUCI: So they made the recommendation for those 65 years of age and older and those 18 to 64 who are in the situation where they may be at high risk to develop severe disease. SHAPIRO: The people doing the approving are the FDA Advisory Committee, and the booster is from Pfizer-BioNTech. So we're only talking about one of the three vaccines that Americans have received. Fauci hopes that this pause might give Moderna and Johnson & Johnson time to catch up in the approval process. FAUCI: The question is, when will there be enough data to be able to be submitted to the FDA to get a recommendation likely through an emergency use authorization? SHAPIRO: He says that could happen in the next three weeks. FAUCI: Hopefully for both of them at that time so that there isn't a delay for the people who originally got Moderna and who originally got J&J. SHAPIRO: For those who got the J&J shot, there is some good news this week. The company announced that a second dose two months or later after the first would give 94% immunity against COVID. SAAD OMER: I think a lot of people were waiting for data on additional doses of J&J. SHAPIRO: Dr. Saad Omer is director of the Yale Institute for Global Health. OMER: There was concern amongst those people who had received a single dose about less than equivalent protection compared to the other vaccines. So I think it will be well-received. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)SHAPIRO: Some medical experts don't think we should be focusing on booster shots for vaccinated Americans as growing numbers of unvaccinated people are dying. LUCIANA BORIO: The best way to protect us all individually and collectively is to get more people vaccinated, especially the unvaccinated. They're driving this pandemic. SHAPIRO: Dr. Luciana Borio is a former acting chief scientist for the FDA. BORIO: I fear that, you know, the discussion on boosters has somehow overshadowed the most important message, which is to get more people vaccinated here and globally. SHAPIRO: CONSIDER THIS - most vaccinated adults will have to wait to get a booster shot. But this week brought us one step closer to a day when younger children can get the vaccine. From NPR, I'm Ari Shapiro. It's Tuesday, September 21. It's CONSIDER THIS from NPR. This week, Pfizer-BioNTech announced that its vaccine is safe for kids ages 5 to 11. Up until now, age 12 had been the cutoff. PETER HOTEZ: Well, I think it's really important news. SHAPIRO: Dr. Peter Hotez is co-director of the Center for Vaccine Development at Texas Children's Hospital. HOTEZ: We're seeing so many kids now in this delta wave across the country, especially in the southern part of the U. S. and in the Mountain West. A lot of kids getting admitted to pediatric hospitals, children's hospitals, even pediatric ICUs. SHAPIRO: Hotez told NPR and WBUR's Here & Now that about 2,000 kids ages 5 to 11 have been vaccinated in the Pfizer-BioNTech trial. And Hotez says the dosage was smaller than what adults got. HOTEZ: So it's 10 micrograms versus 30 micrograms for the older teenagers and the adults. SHAPIRO: Hotez says a smaller vaccine dosage doesn't necessarily mean a smaller effect. HOTEZ: Vaccines are not so dose-dependent often. And by that, I mean it's not like a small molecule drug or a medicine that you take, where twice the - twice the dose may have twice the effect. SHAPIRO: In fact, sometimes smaller doses actually produce stronger immune responses. HOTEZ: So for instance, with the Moderna boost that's coming up, it's likely that that's going to be half the dose of the previous ones because that may - there's a phenomenon in vaccines called fractional dosing where you even get a better immune response. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)SHAPIRO: Well, as we know, it can take weeks or months from when a company like Pfizer says a vaccine is ready to go to when people start getting shots in arms. So I spoke with NPR's Allison Aubrey about what has to happen before kids around the country can get the go ahead. ALLISON AUBREY, BYLINE: The companies say the vaccine was safe, it was well-tolerated and it triggered a strong immune response. And the vaccine-makers say the side effects are about the same as those seen in teens and young adults, such as a sore arm or muscle aches. Albert Bourla, the chairman and CEO of the company, said the trial results provide a foundation for seeking authorization of the vaccine for children 5 to 11 years old, and the company plans to submit them to the FDA with urgency, he said. SHAPIRO: A foundation for seeking authorization - so what are the next steps to getting authorization? AUBREY: Well, the FDA officials have said that they will let the data guide them here, and they hope to have pediatric COVID-19 vaccines available in the coming months, they say. I spoke to David Kimberlin, a pediatric infectious disease doctor at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. He also serves as a liaison from the American Academy of Pediatrics to the CDC's advisory committee. Here he is. DAVID KIMBERLIN: Now, of course, it has to be authorized by the Food and Drug Administration first, and then it has to be recommended for use by the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. And it appears to me now that we're back on track for an October, maybe even mid to late October recommendation. AUBREY: He says it's a very fluid situation, but certainly the FDA receiving data from Pfizer sets the process in motion. SHAPIRO: And there's time pressure to get this done quickly, right? Haven't pediatricians been urging the FDA to move as fast as possible? AUBREY: That's right. Both Pfizer and Moderna expanded their clinical trials in children, and this was done to ensure they could pick up on rare adverse events. Now these trials are ongoing. But back in August, as the delta variant fueled the surge in cases among children, the American Academy of Pediatrics said that delta had kind of changed the equation. Given the urgency, the group said the FDA should strongly consider authorizing vaccines based on data from the initial cohort, or the initial group of children. So, you know, there's some tension, Ari, between wanting to inoculate children against the virus as soon as possible, but also to make sure that the vaccine is safe and that the benefits do outweigh the risks. Dr. Kimberlin says the process is working, and advisers to the FDA will weigh in, and they will speak up if they see any concerns as they review the data. KIMBERLIN: Parents can be, you know, really confident - if the authorization is made and the recommendation is made, they can be really confident that it was done right, that it was based on the data, that it was based on science. AUBREY: And this comes amid a surge in cases in kids. SHAPIRO: Not only a surge in cases, but also child hospitalizations are up, right? AUBREY: That's right. I mean, most cases among kids are mild, but many pediatric clinics and ERs are full, especially in states that have been hardest hit by this surge. There are just so many cases among kids right now, Dr. Kimberlin says. SHAPIRO: A quarter of a million children every week over the last, you know, couple or three weeks being diagnosed with COVID - these are outpatient and inpatient, of course. But those numbers are unprecedented. AUBREY: So that's the latest on vaccine shots for children. What about news that we might get this week on booster shots for adults? What's the latest there? AUBREY: Sure. Well, the FDA is expected to announce a decision any time now, really, Ari, on a Pfizer booster. CDC advisers voted late last week in favor of boosters for people 65 and up and those at high risk. Now, the agency typically follows the advisers' guidance here, and the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices is scheduled to meet this Wednesday. So we could hear a decision very soon. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)SHAPIRO: NPR correspondent Allison Aubrey. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)SHAPIRO: While parents anxious to get their school aged kids vaccinated may have to wait until at least October, some countries have already started giving shots to younger children. My colleague Leila Fadel spoke with NPR correspondent and editor Maria Godoy about what lessons the U. S. can learn from the rollout elsewhere. LEILA FADEL, BYLINE: So what other countries have started vaccinating young children? MARIA GODOY, BYLINE: Only a small number of countries are already vaccinating kids under 12. Cuba has started vaccinating kids as young as 2 with its own proprietary vaccine. Cambodia is giving shots to kids 6 and up. And China has approved two of its vaccines for use in kids as young as 3. Israel is vaccinating kids as young as 5 with the Pfizer vaccine, but only if they have severe underlying health conditions. And Chile this month started mass vaccinations for 6 to 11 year olds. It's using the Chinese-made Sinovac vaccine. FADEL: So what do we know about how these vaccines in general are performing in kids? GODOY: Well, there's a good sense of the safety profile of these vaccines. Let's look at Chile, for example. They're already moving ahead with Sinovac, even though the phase three trials, which really give you a big picture of safety and efficacy, they're just getting started. What we do know from earlier trials is that the vaccine is safe in children 3 and up and produces a strong immune response, although this was only in about 550 kids, which is not a lot. But I spoke with Dr. Miguel O'Ryan. He's a pediatric infectious disease specialist in Chile who advises the government on its vaccine strategy. He said Chilean officials were shown unpublished data that convinced them that the Sinovac vaccine was safe for kids this young. And Chile is running its own studies as it rolls the vaccine out to get more data on it. FADEL: OK, so Chile is moving forward, and the U. S. may make a decision in a couple of weeks. Are more countries likely to follow? GODOY: You know, the big question other than safety is, how effective are these vaccines in young kids? And we don't really know a lot about that yet. For example, Pfizer hasn't released data on whether any kids in the trial have gotten COVID, so we can't compare how often kids in the vaccinated group versus the placebo group got sick. So we don't know, for example, is it 90% effective at preventing infection? What we do know from data so far is that both Pfizer and Sinovac vaccines elicit a strong immune response in kids, akin to that in adults. We just don't have direct efficacy data yet. Given that uncertainty, Chile's Miguel O'Ryan says vaccinating younger kids isn't necessarily a clear-cut decision for countries at this time. MIGUEL O'RYAN: You know, you can either wait for - have more data to support this strategy or move forward with that uncertainty if you have already covered the high-risk groups. GODOY: And Chile has done that. More than 87% of its adults are fully vaccinated now. FADEL: So we're talking about strategies for vaccinating kids under 12. Meanwhile, some countries are still deciding whether to vaccinate even older kids, right? GODOY: Yeah. In the U. K. recently, a government advisory board actually recommended limiting vaccines for 12 to 15 year olds to those with underlying health conditions. They just weren't convinced that the risk of potential side effects was worth the benefit, given the low risk of hospitalization and death for children, though some kids can get very sick and even die. But these advisers were actually overruled by government health officials who thought minimizing disruptions to the school year was the stronger argument in favor of vaccinating kids 12 and up. SHAPIRO: NPR science editor and correspondent Maria Godoy. You're listening to CONSIDER THIS FROM NPR. I'm Ari Shapiro.

They just weren't convinced that the risk of potential side effects was worth the benefit, given the low risk of hospitalization and death for children, though some kids can get very sick and even die. But these advisers were actually overruled by government health officials who thought minimizing disruptions to the school year was the stronger argument in favor of vaccinating kids 12 and up.

While some scientists are dreaming of using advanced DNA sequencing to bring them back in real life, others are still debating what caused their disappearance 10,000 years ago. Jeff St. Clair of member station WKSU reports the debate provides new insights into their extinction. (SOUNDBITE OF FLINT STRIKING)JEFF ST CLAIR, BYLINE: Metin Eren often spends his afternoons knapping. METIN EREN: It's a very soothing sound. ST CLAIR: That's knapping with a K. He's a master flint knapper, fashioning stone tools in his experimental archaeology lab at Kent State University. (SOUNDBITE OF FLINT STRIKING)ST CLAIR: Eren is making replica Clovis points, the large, fearsome-looking blades first discovered in the 1920s near Clovis, N. M. They were the signature weapon of Paleo Indian hunters who spread across North America 13,000 years ago. They entered a landscape filled with mythical megafauna - woolly mammoths, mastodons, giant ground sloths and saber-toothed cats, all of which soon disappeared. Scientists have long debated whether hunters armed with Clovis tips caused these extinctions. Eren is using his flint knapping skills to find out. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEAR THROWER CLATTERING)ST CLAIR: Along with a mechanical spear thrower - it's basically a bow calibrated to replicate the speed of a thrown or thrusted spear - Eren uses lumps of clay to mimic mammoth meat. He's testing how far a Clovis point penetrates. EREN: Three, two, one. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEAR THROWER FIRING)EREN: Oh, nice. So let's see how far it went into this block here - four inches. And that's going straight into flesh - no hide, no hair, nothing. I mean, if you're firing this at a actual mammoth, run as quick as you can because all you're going to do is annoy it. ST CLAIR: In a recent study, Eren and his team fired different-sized Clovis points into the clay meat more than 200 times. They found that, at least in the lab, the large stone weapons are not very good at killing elephant-like creatures. EREN: This evidence suggests that not only did we not cause the extinction of proboscideans. I don't think we could have. ST CLAIR: Todd Surovell, an archaeologist at the University of Wyoming, isn't buying it. He spent the past seven years excavating a side along the Platte River where he believes ice age hunters speared a mammoth and set up camp to butcher it. He has no doubt that Clovis hunters routinely brought down elephants. TODD SUROVELL: I tend to believe the archaeological evidence over this experimental evidence. ST CLAIR: Not only that. He thinks these hunters were so adept that soon after arriving in North America, they killed off mammoths, mastodons and the like. SUROVELL: Any time humans colonize a new environment, a massive wave of extinction follows. ST CLAIR: It's called the overkill hypothesis - the idea that if Paleo Indians hadn't arrived here first, Europeans would have met mammoths in the New World. David Meltzer, an archaeologist at Southern Methodist University, says the overkill hypothesis coincided with the emerging environmental movement of the late 1960s. DAVID MELTZER: Earth Day was created in 1970, so all that stuff is swirling around. ST CLAIR: While the idea of ancient extinctions at the hands of humans served as a powerful warning, Meltzer says the dozen or so sites where mammoth bones and stone tools were found together are not a smoking gun. MELTZER: That's one crime we didn't commit. We're guilty of God knows a million other things, but that's not one of them. ST CLAIR: He points to massive climate change 15,000 years ago that set processes in motion, wiping out dozens of ice age species without human help. The debate over whether we killed them off is more than academic. It holds open the possibility that there may have been a time when humans weren't the most destructive force on the planet.

Scientists are about to get a new shot at answering that question because in December, NASA plans to launch the most powerful telescope ever put into space. NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce reports that we'll spend a lot of time studying planets outside our solar system. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE, BYLINE: Laura Kreidberg studies planets that orbit distant stars. She's an astronomer at the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Germany. And she says for her entire career, she's been waiting for the James Webb Space Telescope. LAURA KREIDBERG: I think the earliest discussions about James Webb were happening in the 1990s, when I was in elementary school. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Astronomers wanted to build a huge telescope that could capture light from some of the earliest galaxies to appear after the Big Bang. This telescope has been a long time coming. KREIDBERG: It has been something that has been looming on the horizon. Every year, it's, you know, one more year. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Finally it's scheduled to launch this December. The James Webb Space Telescope is named after a former NASA administrator. And once it's in space, one of its major activities will be studying planets beyond our solar system. Kreidberg says that was never part of its original mission. When this telescope was first proposed, such planets had only just started to be discovered. KREIDBERG: Now, 25 years after the first planet was discovered around another star, we know that pretty much every star on average has at least one planet. GREENFIELDBOYCE: The trouble is it's difficult to know what these far-off planets are really like. Scientists usually never see the planet; they detect it indirectly by watching how the planet affects its star. Lisa Kaltenegger is an astronomer at Cornell University. She says it is sometimes possible to learn a bit about a planet's atmosphere by analyzing starlight that filters through it. LISA KALTENEGGER: We can do this analysis right now for the big, hot planets with lots of gas that the light shines through. But for the small planets, like the Earth, with a little bit of an atmosphere, we need to catch more light to do the same thing. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Because James Webb is huge, it can catch enough light to let scientists analyze the chemical makeup of small, rocky planets' atmospheres. That's important because if any of those planets has life, you'd expect to see certain combinations of different gases in the air, like oxygen plus methane. Nikole Lewis, another astronomer at Cornell, says these telltale gas mixtures are called biosignatures. NIKOLE LEWIS: The James Webb Space Telescope does have the capability to measure those key biosignatures. GREENFIELDBOYCE: One intriguing planetary system that James Webb will study is about 40 light years away. There's a small, cool star that's orbited by seven Earth-sized planets. Three of them orbit in a zone where temperatures should be mild enough to have water in liquid form. Lewis says the first question scientists want to answer is, do these planets have air? LEWIS: And then we're going to go from there. OK, what's that air made of? And is the air the same for planets that are close to the star or planets that are far from the star? And so it's a perfect little laboratory that, you know, nobody expected we would find. And it's a perfect target for the James Webb Space Telescope. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Still, trying to tease out subtle combinations of gases that might mean life is a really, really hard thing to do. And remember, James Webb was never designed with this in mind. That's why, even as scientists are excited for it to launch later this year, many are also pushing for future space telescopes that will be designed from the start to search other planets for signs of life.

NPR health correspondent Rob Stein joins us now. Rob, helping blind people see sounds miraculous. What exactly do they do? ROB STEIN, BYLINE: Yeah. So they use this gene-editing technique called CRISPR, which lets scientists make very precise changes in DNA much more easily than ever before. It's been showing promise for treating blood disorders, like sickle cell disease. And doctors are trying to use it to treat cancer. But those experiments involve taking cells out of the body, editing them in the lab and then infusing the modified cells back into patients' bodies. In this case, they did something completely different. You can't take cells out of the retina in the eye and put them back in. So they infused the CRISPR gene editor directly into cells in the retina in the eye to edit a gene while still inside the body - inside the eye. Here's Dr. Eric Pierce at the Harvard Medical School. He's helping conduct this experiment. ERIC PIERCE: This is the first time we're having evidence that gene editing is functioning inside somebody. And it's improving, in this case, visual function. We're thrilled about this. STEIN: Now, you know, Pierce stresses that this is very preliminary. Doctors have only tried this on seven volunteers so far. And they have to treat a lot more patients and follow them a lot longer to really know for sure how well it's working. But nevertheless, they're ecstatic that it looks safe and it looks like it could be helping people. And, you know, A, NPR got exclusive access to interview two of these volunteers, and they're thrilled, too. MART\u00cdNEZ: Yeah - blown away by everything so far, Rob, especially getting that access. So what can you tell us about these people? STEIN: Yeah. So they were both born with a rare genetic condition called Leber congenital amaurosis, which is caused by a genetic mutation that progressively disables the function of key light-sensing cells in the retina. Dr. Pierce and his colleagues infused billions of harmless viruses that were genetically modified to carry the CRISPR gene editor into their retinas to literally cut out the mutation. The hope is that it would restore the function of the cells in the retina and restore at least some vision. And it looks like it worked for at least some of the patients. One of them is Carlene Knight. She's 55, and lives outside Portland, Ore. Her vision is still far from normal. But everything is much brighter and clearer. She can find doorways and move around a lot easier, look down and she things she's dropped in the floor. And then there's colors. They're so much more vibrant now. CARLENE KNIGHT: I've always loved color since I was a kid. It's one of the things I could really, you know, enjoy, even with just a small amount of vision. But now I realize how much brighter they were as a kid because I can see them a lot more brilliantly now. It's - well, it's just amazing. STEIN: You know, to celebrate, she dyed her hair her favorite color. . . MART\u00cdNEZ: (Laughter). STEIN: . . . Green. Yeah. You know, and I also talked to Michael Kalberer. He's 43 and lives on Long Island. He's reporting a lot of the same things and can do something he hasn't been able to do for years - watch sunsets. MICHAEL KALBERER: The first time I saw one, I was coming home from a meal with a friend. I see pink in the sky. She goes, yeah, you see the sunset. That's the sunset. And we both smiled at each other. So it was a great moment. MART\u00cdNEZ: I'm thinking Carlene's in Oregon. She might be an Oregon Ducks fan. That's why she painted it green - or dyed it. STEIN: (Laughter) Yeah. That's right. MART\u00cdNEZ: Now, Rob, what else could this be used for? STEIN: Yeah. You know, scientists hope that there are many other diseases that they could use this on, where it's not possible to take cells out of the body, edit them in the lab and infuse them back in - you know, brain diseases like Huntington's and muscle diseases like muscular dystrophy. Now, no one is trying that yet, but this could open the door to that. But these researchers are trying a higher dose on adults and planning kids, too.

STEIN: You know, to celebrate, she dyed her hair her favorite color. . . MART\u00cdNEZ: (Laughter). STEIN: . . . Green. Yeah. You know, and I also talked to Michael Kalberer. He's 43 and lives on Long Island. He's reporting a lot of the same things and can do something he hasn't been able to do for years - watch sunsets. MICHAEL KALBERER: The first time I saw one, I was coming home from a meal with a friend. I see pink in the sky. She goes, yeah, you see the sunset. That's the sunset. And we both smiled at each other. So it was a great moment. MART\u00cdNEZ: I'm thinking Carlene's in Oregon. She might be an Oregon Ducks fan. That's why she painted it green - or dyed it. STEIN: (Laughter) Yeah. That's right. MART\u00cdNEZ: Now, Rob, what else could this be used for? STEIN: Yeah. You know, scientists hope that there are many other diseases that they could use this on, where it's not possible to take cells out of the body, edit them in the lab and infuse them back in - you know, brain diseases like Huntington's and muscle diseases like muscular dystrophy. Now, no one is trying that yet, but this could open the door to that. But these researchers are trying a higher dose on adults and planning kids, too. MART\u00cdNEZ: That's NPR health correspondent Rob Stein. Rob, thanks a lot. STEIN: You bet. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)", "section": "Science", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2021 NPR.

NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce explains why that is. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE, BYLINE: James Webb became head of NASA in 1961, just months before President John Kennedy pledged to put a man on the moon. JOHN LOGSDON: He was a consummate Washington insider. He knew how to work both Congress and the executive branch. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Space historian John Logsdon is with George Washington University. He knew Webb. LOGSDON: He told Kennedy when he was asked to take the job, I'm not a scientist; you should have a scientist. And Kennedy said, no, I want a policy person. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Traditionally, space telescopes are named after famous scientists, not policy people. So why is Webb's name on the telescope? Because of Sean O'Keefe. He admired Webb. And a couple decades ago, when O'Keefe was the head of NASA, the agency was starting on a big new space telescope. O'Keefe casually asked folks how they'd feel about naming it after Webb. SEAN O'KEEFE: There was not a formal process. There was no panel. There was no appointed group of commissioners to come up with the name. No, it was more of a - what do you think of this idea? GREENFIELDBOYCE: No one objected, so Webb got the honor. Recently, though, some scientists and historians have raised concerns that Webb was complicit in the lavender scare of the 1950s and 1960s, when gay government workers were interrogated and fired. For example, NASA employee Clifford Norton lost his job and later sued. Chanda Prescod-Weinstein is a cosmologist at the University of New Hampshire. She wants the telescope renamed. CHANDA PRESCOD-WEINSTEIN: At best, Webb's record is complicated/not great. And at worst, we're basically just sending this incredible instrument into the sky with the name of a homophobe on it. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Over 1,200 astronomers and space enthusiasts signed a letter asking NASA to reconsider the name. The agency said it would investigate the matter. Now, NASA Administrator Bill Nelson has put out a statement saying, quote, \"we have found no evidence at this time that warrants changing the name of the James Webb Space Telescope. \" But NASA hasn't provided any other information about the investigation. This frustrates Prescod-Weinstein. PRESCOD-WEINSTEIN: I really just want to see rationale, and I want to see openness. And right now we're not seeing either, and that breaks my heart.

I'm Manoush Zomorodi. And today, we are starting the show with a case of heartbreak. SANDEEP JAUHAR: A patient of mine was admitted to the hospital, and weeks prior, her husband had died. And a couple of weeks after the funeral, she took a look at his picture, and all these emotions came back, flooded back - sadness, the grief over their life together. ZOMORODI: This is cardiologist Sandeep Jauhar. JAUHAR: She developed chest pain, and she got short of breath. And by the time she was in the hospital, she had distended neck veins, water in her lungs, she was visibly panting - all signs of congestive heart failure. So we suspected that she had actually had a heart attack, that she had blockages in the arteries that feed her heart, but when we checked with a angiogram, her coronary arteries were pristine. There wasn't a hint of blockage anywhere, but her heart had weakened to less than half its normal function, and it had a very unusual shape. And what we found was that it was the syndrome takotsubo cardiomyopathy, or the broken heart syndrome. ZOMORODI: Wait, what is that? JAUHAR: So takotsubo is a special pot that's used in Japan to trap octopuses, and it has a sort of wide base and a very narrow neck. And that's exactly the way her heart looked on the ultrasound that we did. The base was constricted. The apex of the heart had ballooned out into this distinctive shape. ZOMORODI: Whoa. That is crazy. So her heart was, like, swollen, and this is what heartbreak can look like, literally. JAUHAR: Yeah. So emotions and the responses that they engender can have a direct effect on the heart, and the heart can acutely weaken in response to a heartbreak or grief such as after the death of a loved one or the end of a romantic relationship. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)JAUHAR: So we told her that, very likely, this would improve, you know, once her emotional state had returned to normal, and that's exactly what happened. You know, once the grief had subsided and she came back to sort of her baseline state, we repeated the ultrasound, and her heart had returned to normal. So you know, it's just a fascinating syndrome. We too often think of the emotional aspects of the heart as purely metaphorical or symbolic. But emotions can have a direct disruptive effect on the heart, and there really is such a thing as heartbreak. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ZOMORODI: The average human heart beats nearly 3 billion times over the course of a life, but when stress, fear or sadness weigh on us, the heart can suffer, sometimes even break. There are, however, ways we can mend it. And so today on the show, stories and ideas about soothing heartache. From the connection between our emotions and our health to protecting our romantic relationships and facing our anxiety about the future, we'll explore ways we can nurture our most vital organ. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ZOMORODI: Sandeep Jauhar's fixation on the heart stems back to his family history and a story about his grandfather from 1953, before Sandeep was even born. JAUHAR: It was a summer day in July. My grandfather was working in a tiny shop in Kanpur, which was a rural community in North India, and he was bitten by a snake. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)JAUHAR: Now, snakebite is fairly common in India, and when my grandfather came home for lunch, he was feeling fine. But some neighbors brought in the snake that they claimed had bitten my grandfather, and it was a shiny black cobra. And my grandfather took one look at it, and he slumped to the floor and died. At the hospital, a doctor pronounced him dead on arrival and said that it wasn't a snakebite that killed my grandfather, but it was a heart attack, probably induced by the sudden sort of tremendous fright of looking at the snake that had bitten him and the fear that he was not going to be able to survive the snakebite. ZOMORODI: So it's not just grief or romantic heartache that can affect our hearts. It can be any really extreme emotion. JAUHAR: Right. ZOMORODI: Was this a story that you heard a lot when you were growing up? JAUHAR: Yeah. That event was profoundly tragic in our family, and I sort of grew up with this fear that something would happen to my own father. And that fear translated to sort of an obsession. I remember I would lie in bed and sort of monitor the thudding of my heart in my chest. I would look up at the ceiling fan that was rotating and try to synchronize the rotations of the blades with my heartbeat. And I sort of became obsessed with this sort of dichotomous nature of the heart, that it was constantly moving and yet so vulnerable and, in the process, made us vulnerable. In other words, there was such a thing as sudden death, and the fact is that sudden death almost always occurs because of the cessation of the heartbeat. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ZOMORODI: Here's Sandeep Jauhar on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)JAUHAR: Heart syndromes, including sudden death, have long been reported in individuals experiencing intense emotional disturbance or turmoil in their metaphorical hearts. In 1942, the Harvard physiologist Walter Cannon published a paper called \"'Voodoo' Death,\" in which he described cases of death from fright in people who believed they had been cursed, such as by a witch doctor or as a consequence of eating taboo fruit. In many cases, the victim, all hope lost, dropped dead on the spot. What these cases had in common was the victim's absolute belief that there was external force that could cause their demise and against which they were powerless to fight. This perceived lack of control, Cannon postulated, resulted in an unmitigated physiological response in which blood vessels constricted to such a degree that blood volume acutely dropped, blood pressure plummeted, the heart acutely weakened and massive organ damage resulted from a lack of transported oxygen. Today, death by grief has been seen in spouses and in siblings. Broken hearts are literally and figuratively deadly. ZOMORODI: You know, Sandeep, I think we hear a lot these days about how stress is bad for us, it's bad for our health. But do you feel like people just don't take that seriously enough or they don't understand the stakes of, like, how much stress and emotions are connected to our physical well-being? JAUHAR: Yeah. You know, the American Heart Association, for the longest time, did not list psychosocial stress as a key modifiable risk factor for heart disease. Now, why is that? I think the reason is that it's so much easier to lower blood pressure than it is to lower emotional stress. You can take a pill to lower your cholesterol or your blood pressure, but psychosocial stress is just an entirely different beast. And, you know, it's interesting that I went through a three-year training program in cardiology, and not once did we talk about the effect of stress or the emotions on the heart. ZOMORODI: And so how do we (laughter) - what do we do, Sandeep? How do we get to this middle place where we feel - I mean, is it - you know, you open a magazine and you'll be told to meditate, basically. But I think what you're talking about is both on an individual way managing our own stress and also a systemic way that we need to care for ourselves differently. JAUHAR: So there are a lot of ways to go about it, but I think the first step is to recognize that there's a problem. Do you know how long a typical American doctor allows a patient to speak before interrupting them? About 16 seconds. I was one of those doctors. But nowadays, I'll walk in, and I'll let the patient talk. And increasingly, I see that if I let the patient really describe what's bothering them, you can get deeper. You can get to the sort of root cause of things. I've just recently actually learned about a patient who was having heart failure symptoms and, you know, all sorts of physical trouble. And it turned out that he'd had a tremendously disrupted relationship with his two daughters, and that grief over that disrupted relationship just came out in the office visit. He was weeping. So we actually reached out to the daughters, you know, and talked to them about what was going on at his request. And, you know, the improvement in that relationship with his daughters had tremendous effects on his physical health. So I would say that this is a very fertile area. And, you know, I think we would do well to act in ways, change our lifestyles, to pay, you know, respect to the intense sort of effects of emotions on, you know, this organ that we need to survive.

Joining us now to talk about the new results is NPR's Joe Palca. Joe, tell us about this new drug. JOE PALCA, BYLINE: Well, it's an antiviral drug called molnupiravir. And it's different from monoclonal antibody therapy because it works by blocking the ability of the virus to replicate, in the same way some of the AIDS drugs block the replication of HIV. It was developed a number of years ago by researchers at Emory University. MART\u00cdNEZ: I've got to say, the study results - reducing death or hospitalization by half - that sounds pretty impressive. PALCA: Yes, it really does. And here's what former FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb had to say about it this morning on CNBC. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)SCOTT GOTTLIEB: This is a phenomenal result. I mean, this is a profound game changer, to have an oral pill that had this kind of effect, this magnitude of effect in patients who are at high risk who are already symptomatic. PALCA: Now, the results haven't been published yet. So as you said when we started, this is all coming from a company news release. But here's what we know from the company. It was tested in 775 people who had mild-to-moderate COVID-19. Treatment started within five days of the appearance of symptoms. And also, all the people in the study were at risk of severe disease because of some underlying health problem. Half got the drug. Half got the placebo. And 7% of the patients receiving the drug were either hospitalized or died, compared with 14% percent who received placebo. So as you say, that's cutting the rate in half. But for perspective, you could turn that on its head and say, well, 86% of the people getting the placebo didn't wind up being hospitalized or dying, compared with 93% who didn't if they took the drug. So - and another thing to keep in mind is monoclonal antibody therapy, which is already out there, works a little bit better. MART\u00cdNEZ: Yeah. PALCA: But it's harder to administer. And the pill is much easier - obviously, an oral pill. And it's much easier to make than the monoclonal antibodies. MART\u00cdNEZ: Any serious side effects reported? PALCA: No. There were none from this study - that they report, anyway. But there have been reports from laboratory tests that this drug could cause genetic mutations. And it was interesting that the men in this study were urged to refrain from sexual intercourse while they were taking the drug. . . MART\u00cdNEZ: OK. PALCA: . . . Because they didn't want people to get pregnant. MART\u00cdNEZ: So what happens next? PALCA: Well, Merck says it will apply to the Food and Drug Administration for what's called an emergency use authorization. That's not approval. But, you know, these have been used as a way of getting things available much faster. And the company says that it has 1. 7 million courses of therapy ready to go if and when the drug is authorized. MART\u00cdNEZ: One more thing - any more drugs like this in the pipeline? PALCA: Yeah. There are a couple. Both the giant companies Roche and Pfizer say they've got similar drugs in the pipeline. So we may be hearing more about this before too terribly long. MART\u00cdNEZ: All right. That's NPR's Joe Palca. Joe, thanks a lot. PALCA: You're welcome.

It was tested in 775 people who had mild-to-moderate COVID-19. Treatment started within five days of the appearance of symptoms. And also, all the people in the study were at risk of severe disease because of some underlying health problem. Half got the drug. Half got the placebo. And 7% of the patients receiving the drug were either hospitalized or died, compared with 14% percent who received placebo. So as you say, that's cutting the rate in half. But for perspective, you could turn that on its head and say, well, 86% of the people getting the placebo didn't wind up being hospitalized or dying, compared with 93% who didn't if they took the drug. So - and another thing to keep in mind is monoclonal antibody therapy, which is already out there, works a little bit better. MART\u00cdNEZ: Yeah. PALCA: But it's harder to administer. And the pill is much easier - obviously, an oral pill. And it's much easier to make than the monoclonal antibodies. MART\u00cdNEZ: Any serious side effects reported? PALCA: No. There were none from this study - that they report, anyway. But there have been reports from laboratory tests that this drug could cause genetic mutations. And it was interesting that the men in this study were urged to refrain from sexual intercourse while they were taking the drug. . . MART\u00cdNEZ: OK. PALCA: . . . Because they didn't want people to get pregnant. MART\u00cdNEZ: So what happens next? PALCA: Well, Merck says it will apply to the Food and Drug Administration for what's called an emergency use authorization. That's not approval. But, you know, these have been used as a way of getting things available much faster. And the company says that it has 1. 7 million courses of therapy ready to go if and when the drug is authorized. MART\u00cdNEZ: One more thing - any more drugs like this in the pipeline? PALCA: Yeah. There are a couple. Both the giant companies Roche and Pfizer say they've got similar drugs in the pipeline. So we may be hearing more about this before too terribly long. MART\u00cdNEZ: All right. That's NPR's Joe Palca. Joe, thanks a lot.

S. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)ROCHELLE WALENSKY: We're beginning to see cases and hospitalizations decrease from their peaks in late August and early September. CORNISH: CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said late last week, September was a month of declines in cases and hospitalizations. Deaths from COVID-19, a lagging indicator, are falling, too. And that's even with more and more students going back to school and college in person. The bad news? (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)WALENSKY: Deaths remain substantially higher in states with low vaccine coverage. CORNISH: And those deaths pushed the U. S. past a brutal milestone over the weekend - 700,000 people are dead from COVID-19. That's according to data from Johns Hopkins University. But there's evidence our national vaccine rate may continue to go up as more vaccine rules take effect. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"MORNING JOE\")BILL DE BLASIO: Mandates work. They make us safer. I would urge every mayor in America, do it now. Get those vaccine mandates. . . CORNISH: New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio told MSNBC just last week that vaccinations went up 45% after the city began to require them for indoor dining. And when it comes to the city's vaccine mandate for school staff, de Blasio said last week that 93% of teachers had gotten a first dose ahead of a Monday deadline to do so. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"MORNING JOE\")DE BLASIO: There's so much noise when you put a mandate forward. But whether it's the one we did for schools or the one we did for indoor dining, the bottom line is when the dust settled, a huge number of people went out and got vaccinated. CORNISH: CONSIDER THIS - across the country, the number of cases from the delta surge is falling, while the number of cities, states and businesses with vaccine rules is on the rise. Coming up, more on how those rules are playing out. From NPR, I'm Audie Cornish. It's Monday, October 4. It's CONSIDER THIS FROM NPR. Now we should note here that just because the U. S. is coming out of the delta surge does not mean the worst of the pandemic is automatically behind us. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"THIS WEEK\")ANTHONY FAUCI: We certainly are turning the corner on this particular surge. The way to keep it down is to get people vaccinated. When you have 70 million people. . . CORNISH: Dr. Anthony Fauci told ABC News on Sunday there are still 70 million eligible Americans who have not gotten the vaccine yet. At the same time, a growing number of them are subject to vaccine rules in their place of work. And so you may be hearing more about those rules and stories like this. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #1: What is next for Novant Health? That is the question we're asking today after 175 employees were fired for refusing to get the COVID-19 vaccine. CORNISH: This past week, a hospital system in North Carolina was in the news after it fired employees who did not comply with its vaccine policy. The headlines were about the 175 people who did not get vaccinated, not about the ones who did. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #2: Currently, Novant Health has more than 35,000 employees across the state. CORNISH: And of those 35,000? (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #3: Ninety-nine percent of Novant Health's employees are in compliance with the vaccine mandate. CORNISH: That means, at Novant Health, the vaccine holdouts made up a fraction of 1% of the workforce. It's a similar story at United Airlines. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #4: Tonight, nearly 600 United Airlines employees losing their jobs. CORNISH: Now, that was the headline last week after a deadline passed for United workers to show proof of vaccination. By Thursday? (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #5: The company says after it announced that 593 employees would be fired for not complying, that number dropped by nearly half. CORNISH: Meaning, in total, a little more than 300 United employees may lose their jobs, but that's in a workforce of 67,000 people, meaning their vaccination rate is 99%. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JEFF ZIENTS: The data is clear. When organizations implement vaccine requirements, vaccination rates soared in 90% or greater. CORNISH: White House COVID coordinator Jeff Zients cited United and Novant last week when he called on more companies to require vaccines. In recent days, three other major airlines did just that. American, Alaska Airlines and JetBlue will require their employees to be vaccinated. Two other big companies, Procter & Gamble and AT&T, also announced vaccine rules last week. And this is all happening before the Biden administration's federal vaccine rule for workers is in place, a rule that's still being written. The administration says it'll be out soon and will require all private businesses with more than a hundred workers to have a vaccine rule or a testing option. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)CORNISH: Now, once that rule goes into effect, it will apply to some 80 million Americans and their workplaces. Enforcing it? Well, that will be the job of a relatively small government agency, one that's not exactly flush with resources. NPR's Andrea Hsu has more. ANDREA HSU, BYLINE: About a month ago, a question went viral on the internet. It started on Twitter and then migrated to TikTok. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Would you all report your unvaccinated co-workers for $200,000? HSU: That was the question - would you report your unvaccinated co-workers for an insane amount of money? Well, here were some of the answers. I would report my co-workers for a bag of Flamin' Hot Cheetos. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: I would report them to get out of work five minutes early. I'd report them to get out of work two minutes early. HSU: Others said they'd do it for a basket of Shake Shack fries, a tangled-up slinky. ARIANNY MERCEDES: I'd do it for free. I'd do it for a Starbucks gift card. I'd do it for a trip to Target. I was not expecting this. HSU: That's Arianny Mercedes, who came up with the original post. She's a public policy major at the University of Virginia. And she has a career-consulting business on the side. As entertaining as those responses are, the idea of snitching on co-workers is not actually that far from reality. Workers do have a role to play in enforcing workplace rules. RICH FAIRFAX: If an employee files a complaint, and if they allege a serious hazard, then OSHA wants to get out there as soon as possible. HSU: Rich Fairfax is a safety consultant who spent more than three decades at OSHA, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. It's the federal agency that sets workplace safety rules and enforces them. He says employees' eyes and ears are crucial because OSHA simply does not have enough inspectors. Nationwide, there are fewer than 2,000 federal and state inspectors. FAIRFAX: And there's - what? - 8 or 9 million workplaces, so you can do the math. HSU: It would be impossible for them to enter every workplace. So in addition to responding to complaints, Fairfax thinks OSHA will just add COVID-related items to inspectors' to-do lists when they're out doing what they normally do - checking up on safety hazards or following up after an incident. FAIRFAX: You know, I think all the OSHA inspectors will be directed to look into the vaccination status and see what the employer has done. HSU: And if a violation is discovered - say, there are no vaccination records on file or no testing program set up - well, OSHA can issue a fine up to $13,600-some for a serious violation, 10 times that for a willful or repeated violation. But more than the threat of fines, Jordan Barab says it's the threat of bad publicity that gets employers to comply. He was acting head of OSHA under President Obama. JORDAN BARAB: Actually, employers told us, you know, OSHA penalties are generally not very much. They're really just part of doing business. What we really don't like is having our names in the press. HSU: OSHA issues stern press releases when they discover a company is violating safety rules. Imagine what that might look like. Such-and-such a business fails to keep its workers safe from COVID-19. Not a good look when the whole country is trying to get past the pandemic. Barab believes the vast majority of companies will comply with the federal vaccine rule once it's rolled out. But still, he says, this is a big moment for OSHA. BARAB: You know, they've been kind of this small agency that nobody noticed much. And suddenly, they're thrown into the spotlight with an extremely controversial policy. HSU: A policy they hope will soon be less controversial, given how many workers have now gotten the shots. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)CORNISH: Andrea Hsu is NPR's labor and workplace correspondent. Earlier, we spoke about the relatively high vaccine rates at some very big companies, but there are workplaces where the denominator is much smaller. Reporter Katia Riddle has this story from Oregon, and that's where some rural workers say they won't comply with a state vaccine order to be vaccinated by mid-October. And if those workers leave, there are not a lot of options to replace them. KATIA RIDDLE, BYLINE: Even before the pandemic, this southeastern corner of Oregon was thin on emergency services. Now some say the vaccine mandates could devastate their small workforce. SAMANTHA CHAMBERLAIN: We were just counting today. There are only, like, 10 of us that are vaccinated. RIDDLE: Samantha Chamberlain supervises EMT ambulance drivers. She works out of the small town of Vale. CHAMBERLAIN: That's 17 people that we lose. RIDDLE: More than half of your staff. CHAMBERLAIN: More than half of our staff, yes. RIDDLE: The order threatens debilitating fines for employers with unvaccinated health care workers, even if they're volunteers, like most of this team. EMT Matthew Kabush commutes an hour each way to his shift at this small station that houses fire and ambulance services. MATTHEW KABUSH: My dad's a firefighter. My - two of my two brothers are firefighters. RIDDLE: His mom was also in the business. Volunteer emergency services are commonly a family affair around here. Kabush says many feel a responsibility to protect their rural community, and thousands of people who live and pass through here are dependent on them to cover a lot of ground - 2,500 square miles. KABUSH: And down there at the 78 junction, that's 90, almost 100 road miles. RIDDLE: Kabush and Chamberlain, who are both vaccinated, look together at a map of their territory. CHAMBERLAIN: Actually, yeah, I think pretty. . . KABUSH: If you include the off-road curves. RIDDLE: With truck drivers traveling through regularly over icy stretches, EMTs here, like Chamberlain, have responded to some horrific accidents. And if the vaccine mandates handicap them, county officials warn lifesaving measures could be delayed by hours. CHAMBERLAIN: I think what makes me the most upset is the fact that my community is going to suffer, and there's nothing I can do about it. RIDDLE: Suffer as the county could lose essential emergency workers. MARTA STODDART: So we're not going to get the shot. We're just not going to do it. RIDDLE: Marta Stoddart is a volunteer EMT in an even more remote part of the county called Jordan Valley. She and her husband are ranchers when they're not driving ambulances. She'd rather let the county cope without emergency services than get vaccinated. STODDART: Then I guess we won't have our service down there, and the county will have to figure stuff out. RIDDLE: Stoddart worries the potential side effects of the vaccine are so serious that getting the shot could mean risking her life. STODDART: Well, if something happens to us, what's going to happen to our bills? What's going to happen to our kids? UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: This is your vaccination card. RIDDLE: At the Malheur County Fairgrounds, cars roll in passed the horse stables - one line for testing, one for vaccination. Someone who says the mandate did bring him in, reluctantly, is Matthew McClain. MATTHEW MCCLAIN: A lot of people I've talked to aren't so much opposed to the vaccine. They're opposed to the mandate. RIDDLE: McClain works for the Department of Corrections. He's here getting the shot with his wife. They were both going to do it eventually, but he's still irritated. MCCLAIN: Being told that you have to put something in your body is kind of a shocking thing to a lot of people. RIDDLE: Some facilities have reported a recent increase in vaccination rates, with staff scared of losing their jobs. According to the state, Malheur County has only about 50% of health care workers vaccinated. SARAH POE: There are people who are going to say no to a vaccine and be at risk because of the mandates. RIDDLE: Sarah Poe is the director of Public Health in Malheur County. She says in this conservative part of the state, when an order comes down from a liberal governor, people have a knee-jerk reaction to it. POE: Really, I think that the politicians need to stay out of it. RIDDLE: Poe says local public health officials who know the community are more compassionate and effective ambassadors for vaccination.

NPR's Jon Hamilton reports that their research could lead to new treatments for pain and a better understanding of how we monitor our own bodies. JON HAMILTON, BYLINE: The work on temperature sensing was done by David Julius at the University of California San Francisco. In an interview with the Nobel website on Monday, Julius said his research came from a desire to understand something we rarely think about. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)DAVID JULIUS: It's true for many of our senses but maybe more so for touch and pain. We experience it, but we take it for granted. HAMILTON: So Julius spent years trying to understand how our body senses temperature. In a 2015 interview with NPR, he described his discovery of a molecule on nerve endings that responds to heat, including the heat we associate with hot foods like wasabi. JULIUS: It's the molecule that allows us to feel that tingle, that pungent sensation from when we eat wasabi or put those kind of agents on our skin or anywhere where we have sensory nerve fibers. HAMILTON: Julius said his team also found that the molecule that senses temperature plays a key role in pain. JULIUS: I work in this area in part because I know there are a lot of people who suffer from chronic pain syndromes, millions of people in this country alone. And we probably need a lot more variety of drugs to treat different types of pain because mechanistically, it's not all going to be one thing. HAMILTON: The research on touch was led by Ardem Patapoutian at Scripps Research in La Jolla, California. Patapoutian helped discover two related molecules that detect the pressure created when something comes in contact with our skin, or, for example, when our bladders fill up. And these molecules also play an important role in pain. Patapoutian says this is especially true for people with nerve diseases that make them very sensitive to any sort of pressure. ARDEM PATAPOUTIAN: So you will experience this, for example, after an injury or sunburn, where just a touch on the shoulder or just wearing a shirt can become painful. And folks who suffer from neuropathic pain have this in a chronic state. HAMILTON: The molecules that sense touch are also critical to something called proprioception. It's a sense that allows us to know the position and movement of our limbs and other body parts even when we can't see them. Diana Bautista of the University of California Berkeley says it's fitting that these two scientists shared the Nobel. DIANA BAUTISTA: So together, David Julius and Ardem Patapoutian unraveled one of the great mysteries in sensory biology - how do we experience touch and temperature? HAMILTON: Jon Hamilton, NPR News. (SOUNDBITE OF AERIAL M'S \"DAZED AND AWAKE\") ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:   Two scientists who helped to explain how we sense temperature and touch have received the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine. NPR's Jon Hamilton reports that their research could lead to new treatments for pain and a better understanding of how we monitor our own bodies. JON HAMILTON, BYLINE: The work on temperature sensing was done by David Julius at the University of California San Francisco. In an interview with the Nobel website on Monday, Julius said his research came from a desire to understand something we rarely think about. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DAVID JULIUS: It's true for many of our senses but maybe more so for touch and pain. We experience it, but we take it for granted. HAMILTON: So Julius spent years trying to understand how our body senses temperature. In a 2015 interview with NPR, he described his discovery of a molecule on nerve endings that responds to heat, including the heat we associate with hot foods like wasabi. JULIUS: It's the molecule that allows us to feel that tingle, that pungent sensation from when we eat wasabi or put those kind of agents on our skin or anywhere where we have sensory nerve fibers. HAMILTON: Julius said his team also found that the molecule that senses temperature plays a key role in pain. JULIUS: I work in this area in part because I know there are a lot of people who suffer from chronic pain syndromes, millions of people in this country alone. And we probably need a lot more variety of drugs to treat different types of pain because mechanistically, it's not all going to be one thing.

But that is not America's only drug problem. In some places, it's not even the biggest. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)JENNY HANSSON: Federal and local police made their biggest meth bust in Oregon history last month. CORNISH: This week, officials announced a record-breaking meth seizure in Eugene, Ore. - almost 400 pounds worth of methamphetamines worth more than a million dollars. And that story has been playing out in other parts of the country. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE)WILLIAM JOY: It's the largest meth seizure ever in North Texas. UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: The largest methamphetamine seizure in Polk County history. Today. . . SUZIE SUH: The biggest meth bust in U. S. history; nearly $20 million worth of drugs seized in the Inland Empire. But. . . CORNISH: All that has happened in the last year in Texas, Florida and California. In San Diego County alone, new data shows last year, 722 people died with meth in their system, a 32% increase over the prior year. Now, weeks ago, the district attorney in San Diego, Summer Stephan, said the county is ground zero for the meth crisis. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)SUMMER STEPHAN: Fentanyl is getting a lot of attention for good reason. It is taking lives. But methamphetamine is still the No. 1 killer, and it is also the No. 1 driver of violence in our community. CORNISH: CONSIDER THIS - meth is surging in America and hitting some marginalized communities the hardest. Now, one state is on the brink of adopting a bold new plan to fight it by paying people not to use. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)CORNISH: From NPR, I'm Audie Cornish. It's Wednesday, October 6. It's CONSIDER THIS FROM NPR. Now, a quick heads up - we do mention suicide in today's episode. Nationwide, meth-related overdoses nearly tripled - that's from 2015 to 2019. Last year in California alone, more people died from overdosing on stimulants like meth than opioids like fentanyl. And throughout the West, 70% of police agencies say meth is their biggest drug problem. Almost a decade ago, it was Billy Lemon's biggest problem, too. He was living in San Francisco, where he wasn't just using meth, he was selling it across state lines. BILLY LEMON: I would get bread bowls, and I would hollow them out. I would line the inside of the sourdough with meth and then cover it back up and shrink-wrap the bread and then send loaves of bread with some accoutrements from Fisherman's Wharf so it looked like a care package to people in Boston. And then they would literally send me 15-, $16,000 in 20s or hundreds via FedEx. CORNISH: But Billy Lemon's addiction wasn't sustainable. He was arrested three times. He did some jail time. And eventually, he stopped selling meth. But he couldn't stop using. And at one point, he tried to take his own life. LEMON: You know, there was a suicide attempt at Pier 23. It didn't happen that day. CORNISH: A friend helped him get into a recovery center, and he walked in with nothing but the clothes on his backLEMON: With zero money; literally zero money. CORNISH: Not even a cellphone - days earlier, he'd chucked his in a trashcan near a park. LEMON: Because I was - I had made the conscious decision to shut all those doors completely and open new ones at whatever cost and however hard that was going to be. And it was hard. CORNISH: It was hard, but Lemon plugged in to the process. Group therapy, opening up, processing his past - he grabbed on to every tool he could to aid in his recovery. LEMON: And so I was going to do rehab, and I was going to do two 12-step meetings a day, and I was going to do outpatient treatment at the same time. CORNISH: There was one other thing Lemon tried. He went to the San Francisco AIDS Foundation, where they offered a recovery program that was strikingly simple. If Billy stayed off drugs, they would pay him. Three times a week, he came in, peed in a cup; negative test, seven bucks in his account. Now, paying users to stay off drugs is not a brand-new idea. It's also not without controversy. But for Lemon, it helped. LEMON: For somebody who had not had any legitimate money without committing felonies, that seemed like a cool thing. CORNISH: After three months, those payments would add up to $300. LEMON: And so I was like, yes. Yes, I want that. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)CORNISH: Billy Lemon spoke to reporter April Dembosky of member station KQED, who reports on California's effort to take the program that helped him statewide. APRIL DEMBOSKY, BYLINE: The treatment is called contingency management, and it incentivizes drug users with money or gift cards to stay off drugs. People can earn up to 3- or $400 over the course of three months. For Lemon, it was about more than just the money. It was about being told, good job. LEMON: It was the first opportunity where I was like, I have self-worth still. It's buried. This person sees it and is willing to give me $7 just to take care of myself. That was very motivating. DEMBOSKY: Studies show contingency management works. In the San Francisco program Billy Lemon did, 63% of participants stopped using meth entirely, and another 19% reduced their use. The small payments aim to rewire the brain's reward system so the person seeks the money or gift card to get a dopamine release instead of meth or coke. LEMON: You're like, oh, oh, oh, I can feel good without the daily use of that substance. Let me try and go one more week. And then all of a sudden, you're at 90 days, and you've actually - you've made a change. DEMBOSKY: But the treatment is controversial. Critics have scoffed at the idea of paying drug users not to use drugs, calling it unethical or a bribe. Most insurers don't cover it. Neither do state Medicaid programs. The feds generally forbid them from offering financial incentives to patients as a protection against fraud and waste. But a California bill now on the governor's desk would make clear that the state's Medicaid program is allowed to offer contingency management. State Senator Scott Wiener is the author. SCOTT WIENER: We need to embrace this proven effective approach, make it clearly legal and start reimbursing for it. DEMBOSKY: Wiener was surprised the bill passed with so much bipartisan support. WIENER: The Republicans love it, which I didn't think they would. But they actually like it because there's an abstinence component to it, right? It's like, we pay you money, and you abstain from using. DEMBOSKY: The state's Department of Health Care Services, which runs California's Medicaid program, is on board. They've already asked federal regulators for explicit permission to offer contingency management. And the Biden administration appears poised to grant it. Dr. Kelly Pfeifer is the department's deputy director of behavioral health. She says stimulant abuse is wreaking havoc on California's jails and courts, foster care and hospitals. KELLY PFEIFER: Which are obviously not only devastating to the person and the family but very expensive for our health care system. DEMBOSKY: Pfeifer says the need is urgent. For opioid addiction, there are three FDA-approved medication therapies, including methadone and buprenorphine. For meth and coke, there are none. And Pfeifer says making contingency management more widely available, it will make more people willing to seek treatment. PFEIFER: Because people will see success stories. They'll see friends and family getting treatment and getting help and getting better. DEMBOSKY: For Billy Lemon, contingency management was just what he needed to jump-start his recovery, to stay the course in rehab. When he got his $300, he bought himself a cellphone. LEMON: Because up until then, \"Breaking Bad-style\" is burner phones, right? My number was never the same. DEMBOSKY: Now, nine years later, he's still sober, and the number he got with the phone paid for with contingency management money is still his number. LEMON: It's a nice reminder of what making good decisions for yourself can turn into. DEMBOSKY: Five years ago, people were surprised by the idea of treating opioid addiction with other drugs, but now it's routine. And if more states join California and begin offering contingency management, maybe it won't seem so strange to pay drug users not to use. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)CORNISH: April Dembosky covers health care for NPR member station KQED in San Francisco. That story came to us from NPR's partnership with KQED and Kaiser Health News. Now, the surge in meth can be traced back almost a decade, and over that time, studies show that certain communities have been hit harder than others - in particular, some Native American and Black communities. NPR's addiction correspondent Brian Mann has this look at what kind of help people in those communities say they need. BRIAN MANN, BYLINE: This summer, Winnie White Tail surveyed a new group of tribal members entering the inpatient treatment clinic she runs for the Arapaho and Cheyenne community in Clinton, Okla. White Tail, herself a Cheyenne tribal member, says half were struggling with methamphetamine addiction. WINNIE WHITE TAIL: I believe it's deeply entrenched across the community, not just in Native communities. It's readily available. It's easy to get. MANN: A new study published in the journal JAMA Psychiatry finds high-risk use of methamphetamines has surged in recent years. One of the study's lead authors is Dr. Nora Volkow, who heads the National Institute on Drug Abuse. Volkow says Native American and Alaska Native communities are being hit especially hard. NORA VOLKOW: The difference is gigantic. So this is a group that actually has had the greatest negative impact from the use of methamphetamine. MANN: Volkow's study found methamphetamine use has surged in nearly every demographic. Far more women are using methamphetamines. There has been a nearly tenfold increase among Black Americans. She says it now appears roughly one-fifth of drug overdose deaths in the U. S. involve methamphetamines. VOLKOW: And so this is huge, and it's basically almost equivalent in terms of the increase in overdose deaths that we're seeing for fentanyl and other synthetic opioids. So the magnitude of the problem is equivalent in terms of mortality. MANN: Dr. Stephen Taylor has led an effort by the American Society of Addiction Medicine to improve addiction care for people of color. He says this study makes it clear - America's public health response needs to expand fast beyond the opioid crisis where he believes too much of the focus was on white communities. STEPHEN TAYLOR: The prototypical people who have been suffering from opioid addiction and dying from overdoses involving opioids have been white people in smaller towns and rural communities. MANN: Taylor says even before this study was published, drug counselors and researchers working in urban areas and Black, Hispanic and Native American communities knew methamphetamines were making dangerous inroads. TAYLOR: Those communities have been confronting a massive increase in addictions to and overdose deaths from methamphetamine for a long time. MANN: The Biden administration has asked Congress for another $10. 7 billion to expand drug treatment programs, but reducing the harm caused by methamphetamines won't be easy. The drug is cheap and widely available and increasingly contaminated with fentanyl. There are no approved medical treatments for methamphetamine addiction as there are for opioids. Researchers say this data shows more high-quality treatment and counseling services are desperately needed, especially programs that work within local cultures. Winnie White Tail says that's what her programs do for the Arapaho and Cheyenne tribes, using community mentoring and traditional tribal practices along with Western drug treatment approaches. WHITE TAIL: Oh, I'm hopeful every day. And I think the younger we can reach our young people, we can begin to turn this corner because a lot of our issues are around low self-esteem, poverty, depression. MANN: There is a final grim warning in this new study. Researchers say their assessment of the devastating harm caused by methamphetamines may not reflect the full scope of the crisis. That's because they weren't able to survey people living in homeless camps and on the streets around the U. S. , where high-risk drug use is known to be widespread.

About a third of U. S. households still cook with natural gas. Environmental groups want to regulate the pollutants as gas utilities fight to preserve their business. NPR's Jeff Brady has more. JEFF BRADY, BYLINE: Americans love gas stoves. It's a romance fueled by a decades-old campaign. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Ninety-nine percent of the restaurants at the New York World's Fair use gas for cooking. UNIDENTIFIED MUSICAL GROUP: (Rapping) Cooking with gas. We all cooks better when we're cooking with gas. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Natural gas, it's so great because I can control the temperature really easily. BRADY: These ads don't tell you that gas stoves emit potentially harmful pollutants into your home. Think about an electric stove. And if the electricity is produced with fossil fuels, the pollution happens at a power plant. But environmental epidemiologist Josiah Kephart says that's different when you're cooking with gas. JOSIAH KEPHART: That combustion is actually occurring right in your kitchen. You can see the blue flame down there where this combustion is happening. BRADY: Kephart is a research fellow at Drexel University and usually studies cooking pollution in Latin America. But we're going to test what's happening in his own Philadelphia rowhouse kitchen. KEPHART: I'm grabbing a large pot here. I'm just going to fill it up with some water as if I was getting ready to cook some pasta. BRADY: To mimic a typical dinner, he also turns the oven to 375 degrees. KEPHART: Lighting the stove. . . (SOUNDBITE OF STOVE IGNITING)KEPHART: . . . And putting the lid on the pot. (SOUNDBITE OF METAL CLANGING)BRADY: NPR rented an air monitor to measure the combustion pollutant that's the biggest concern now with gas stoves, nitrogen dioxide - or NO2. It's a toxic gas the EPA says can prompt breathing problems for people with asthma and other health issues. Kephart has kids. And research shows children living in a home with a gas stove have a 20% increased risk of developing respiratory illness. After just 12 minutes, NO2 levels in his kitchen reach 60% higher than guidelines from the World Health Organization - or WHO. KEPHART: If you had kids or if you had any sort of lung condition, this is at a level where in the literature, in the science, we have seen people start to have these changes in their lungs that could give them worse symptoms or could worsen their disease. BRADY: The longer the stove is on, the more pollution it emits. Kephart says if you're an adult with a healthy body and a large hood over the stove that vents outdoors, these levels probably are not a significant health concern. But with children in the house, he has a plan for his gas stove. KEPHART: It's our highest family priority to get it out and to get an electric stove. BRADY: Environmental groups have stepped up criticism of this indoor pollution issue. Four of them, including the Sierra Club and RMI - formerly Rocky Mountain Institute - call gas stoves a threat to human health. And they want policymakers to regulate gas stove emissions more strictly. The EPA and Consumer Product Safety Commission have given some attention to this, but not enough, says Brady Seals of RMI. BRADY SEALS: Someone's going to have to claim this issue and really make a change because I think as more consumers learn about it, you know, you feel upset. BRADY: Gas utilities and their trade group, the American Gas Association - or AGA - have actually studied the indoor air pollution problem for decades and even developed ways of reducing emissions. One big step was getting rid of pilot lights that burned 24 hours a day on older stoves. But when environmental groups bring up this issue now, gas utilities get defensive. Here's AGA Vice President Sue Forrester at an industry conference a year ago. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)SUE FORRESTER: We now see the environmental sites talking about indoor air quality, telling you that your stove is dangerous because it emits things and it's causing asthma in kids. BRADY: Forrester essentially told colleagues that these efforts, along with the Biden administration's climate plans, present an existential threat to the gas utility business. AGA says it's researching gas versus electric stove emissions but hasn't made the results public yet. AGA repeatedly mentions that no federal agency has seen fit to more strictly regulate emissions from gas stoves. One state is about to do that, though. California has new rules requiring more powerful hoods over gas stoves than electric ones. Environmental groups support this, something Ted Williams of the American Gas Association noted during a public hearing for the rules last year. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TED WILLIAMS: Organizations who are, first and foremost, interested in recommendation for climate concerns, but who have gone onto air quality. . . BRADY: That recording isn't great. Williams says environmental groups are using indoor air quality in their campaign to remove gas from buildings and address larger climate concerns. He's not wrong. Brady Seals of RMI says indoor air quality and climate change are connected. SEALS: Methane, which is what natural gas is made of, it just really wants to leak. BRADY: And it's a powerful climate pollutant. Gas stoves are connected to a vast system of pipelines, compressor stations, fracking operations and wells that leak methane from beginning to end. Utilities have reduced those emissions 70% since 1990, says the AGA. But now the Biden administration's climate plans call for switching to all-electric buildings. To accomplish that, environmentalists like Seals are talking about stoves even though other appliances use more gas. SEALS: It's just really not that sexy to talk about your water heater. But you probably can talk to your friends about their stove. BRADY: Builders and real estate agents will tell you gas stoves are the one gas appliance a lot of customers care about. If gas lines are brought to the house for the stove, it's more likely it'll also get burned in the furnace, water heater and dryer because it's cheaper than electricity. The campaign to ditch gas hasn't caught on yet. The number of gas utility customers is rising, not going down. But there are a few people out there. Jane Stackhouse in Portland, Ore. , says she gets verklempt thinking about climate change and her grandchildren's future. JANE STACKHOUSE: I want them to get to enjoy the kind of life that I've been able to enjoy. BRADY: Last year, after Republican lawmakers in Oregon blocked a big climate bill, she spent more than $35,000 converting both sides of a duplex she owns from gas to electric. Then she asked the gas company to disconnect her. STACKHOUSE: I went out and took pictures of the gas company crew that was cutting up the street. And they were all smiling and laughing. So I guess they were happy to lose a customer, too (laughter). BRADY: Not everyone can afford to do this. The Biden administration wants to offer incentives to encourage more people to make the switch from gas to electric. Jeff Brady, NPR News.

And that has a big effect on the California farmers who use that groundwater while feeding a good part of this country. NPR's Dan Charles reports. DAN CHARLES, BYLINE: In California's Central Valley, right alongside the fields and orchards, you see big pipes coming out of the earth delivering gushers of water from aquifers hundreds of feet underground. (SOUNDBITE OF WATER GUSHING)CHARLES: Farmers have pumped billions of tons of water from their wells this summer. The water table has fallen so much, hundreds of smaller wells that people rely on have gone dry, like Esther Espinoza's. ESTHER ESPINOZA: I see how the big pumps are pumping a lot of water. And I don't have water. So it's something so sad for me. CHARLES: She and her family outside the town of Riverdale now depend on water from a big, black tank in their front yard, which a local nonprofit fills up each week. ESPINOZA: We don't have water for nothing, for the bathroom or my kitchen. So it's something that is necessary but we don't have. CHARLES: For a hundred years, it's been open season on the aquifer in California. Anybody could dig a well on their land and pump as much as they wanted. Farmers got most of it. But even farmers understand that has to change, farmers like Rick Cosyns. I met Cosyns in August in the middle of his almond orchards near the town of Madera. Very sadly, he died two weeks later. RICK COSYNS: It's unsustainable to continue overdrafting the aquifer in the manner that we are. It's just a race to the bottom. CHARLES: There's now a state law gradually going into effect over the next two decades that's supposed to end over-pumping. It says the aquifer is like a bank account, where withdrawals can't exceed deposits. That law is creating winners and some big losers. Cosyns' farm is one of the fortunate ones because it usually has another source of water. He showed me a big ditch built to deliver water from a reservoir created by a dam on the San Joaquin River 25 miles away. COSYNS: I'd sure feel a lot better if this was full of water - most years, it is. CHARLES: When there's enough rain and snow, this farm can use that water to irrigate orchards and also let some of the water just sink back into the ground, eventually replenishing the aquifer. It's a way to keep that underground bank account roughly in balance - making water deposits when there's plenty from the river, pumping water out when there's a drought. So the new law shouldn't hurt this farm too much. The people who've been causing the problem, Cosyns said, are other farmers nearby. COSYNS: The surrounding areas are pumping that water out from under us. CHARLES: Those farmers own land that doesn't get water from the reservoir. They pump from the aquifer every year, making withdrawals, but no deposits. COSYNS: We've made the investments. And others are getting into our bank account that we save for. CHARLES: When you say that directly to somebody who's been pumping the water, how do they react? COSYNS: Like it's their right to do that. But we've come to that day of reckoning when that's not going to be the case. CHARLES: This is the division in California agriculture right now as the groundwater law comes into force, between farmers who get water from California's rivers and reservoirs and those who rely completely on their wells. That second group likely will have to cut their pumping drastically. And they may have to stop growing some of their crops. According to some estimates, anywhere from five to 10% of the state's irrigated farmland will go dry. And that does not sit well with farmers like David Roberts in Tulare County. He shows me a hillside of citrus trees that depend entirely on wells. DAVID ROBERTS: We're going to turn the water crisis into a food crisis because we can't replicate the San Joaquin Valley anywhere else in the United States. CHARLES: This is the only place with the climate and the soil to grow more than 400 different crops, he says. And when consumers realize what they're missing, he expects a backlash. ROBERTS: This ground will come back into production one way or another. CHARLES: Oh, you really think so? ROBERTS: The United States cannot be without the San Joaquin Valley producing fruit. They can't be. CHARLES: Roberts wants the government to step in to deliver more water from rivers and dams to make up for the lost groundwater, keep more land in production. Other water experts say that's not feasible and also not necessary. Some of the valley's crops can grow other places - almost half a million acres of corn, for instance, grown to feed dairy cows. In fact, some experts think the future for the valley looks bright, just different. Jon Reiter, for instance, a consultant to some large-scale farmers in the valley. JON REITER: I actually think it's going to be a better future than the past has been. CHARLES: People are finding creative ways to adapt, he says. Farmers are getting ready to capture a lot more water in years when it rains. They'll flood their fields and replenish the aquifer. That'll make up for part of the groundwater that's now off-limits. Some land will have to stop growing crops. REITER: But we're going to take that land and put it to other uses. CHARLES: Profitable uses, he says. The Central Valley is a great place for solar power. Farmers may even get paid to turn fallowed fields into habitat for birds and lizards and native shrubs. Nobody knows exactly what the Central Valley will look like when this all shakes out. Dozens of local committees are in charge of enforcing the new groundwater law. Soapy Mulholland, a rancher and conservationist who's on half a dozen of these committees, says, they include a much bigger range of voices. SOAPY MULHOLLAND: Disadvantaged communities, you know, farmers who are considering the environment. All those players are at the table. And that's a good thing.

He'll board Blue Origin, the space company founded by billionaire Jeff Bezos. But who gets to fly to space and why? NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce has the story. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE, BYLINE: The first space travelers had to have the right stuff. They were military pilots. But when NASA's space shuttles began flying in the 1980s, all kinds of VIPs started lobbying to go as passengers. A task force decided that flying a non-astronaut would be OK for public education purposes, so in 1984, President Ronald Reagan said he was directing NASA. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)RONALD REAGAN: . . . To choose, as the first citizen passenger in the history of our space program, one of America's finest - a teacher. GREENFIELDBOYCE: NASA created a citizens-in-space program. It was managed by Alan Ladwig. He remembers going on David Letterman's show to talk about it. ALAN LADWIG: And I said the first spaceflight participant program would be the teacher. Well, the very next day when I got back to D. C. , I read The Washington Post - Jake Garn's flying in space. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Who was Jake Garn? A senator who chaired the subcommittee that oversaw NASA's budget. He got NASA to fly him on the space shuttle, as did another member of Congress, Bill Nelson, who now leads NASA. Both went up before the space shuttle Challenger disaster in 1986. That accident killed the whole crew, including the teacher - Christa McAuliffe. LADWIG: There was some criticism out of Congress, some media that - well, this just shows space is too dangerous for an ordinary citizen. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Ladwig says NASA canceled a planned journalist-in-space program, and after that, it only flew professional astronauts - well, except for John Glenn. He was a former astronaut, the first American to ever orbit the Earth. At the age of 77, when he said he wanted to fly again, NASA made an exception. LADWIG: I mean, the media turned out in droves for that mission. The public loved it. He's a national hero, was a national hero. GREENFIELDBOYCE: For people who weren't astronauts or national heroes, the only option for years was paying millions of dollars to Russia. Its space agency sold trips to space stations to a TV journalist from Japan, a bunch of businessmen turned space tourists and, just last week, an actress and movie director. Now, though, Russia has competition from U. S. companies. Virgin Galactic and Blue Origin both offer short flights that have minutes of weightlessness, and SpaceX has a capsule that can orbit the planet for days. In recent months, these firms have taken a motley assortment of people to space, what \"Saturday Night Live\" called random weirdos.

Czabovsky thinks it's in the long-term interest of space companies to make sure their flights also incorporate scientists and people who don't have deep pockets.

But nonetheless, they generally felt positive about space travel's potential for humanity, and more than half said the flights made them believe that one day soon, ordinary people will be able to go to space. Nell Greenfieldboyce, NPR News. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:   Captain Kirk, otherwise known as William Shatner, is scheduled to blast off tomorrow on a quick trip to the edge of space and back. He'll board Blue Origin, the space company founded by billionaire Jeff Bezos. But who gets to fly to space and why? NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce has the story. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE, BYLINE: The first space travelers had to have the right stuff. They were military pilots. But when NASA's space shuttles began flying in the 1980s, all kinds of VIPs started lobbying to go as passengers. A task force decided that flying a non-astronaut would be OK for public education purposes, so in 1984, President Ronald Reagan said he was directing NASA. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) RONALD REAGAN: . . . To choose, as the first citizen passenger in the history of our space program, one of America's finest - a teacher. GREENFIELDBOYCE: NASA created a citizens-in-space program. It was managed by Alan Ladwig. He remembers going on David Letterman's show to talk about it. ALAN LADWIG: And I said the first spaceflight participant program would be the teacher. Well, the very next day when I got back to D. C. , I read The Washington Post - Jake Garn's flying in space. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Who was Jake Garn? A senator who chaired the subcommittee that oversaw NASA's budget. He got NASA to fly him on the space shuttle, as did another member of Congress, Bill Nelson, who now leads NASA. Both went up before the space shuttle Challenger disaster in 1986. That accident killed the whole crew, including the teacher - Christa McAuliffe. LADWIG: There was some criticism out of Congress, some media that - well, this just shows space is too dangerous for an ordinary citizen. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Ladwig says NASA canceled a planned journalist-in-space program, and after that, it only flew professional astronauts - well, except for John Glenn. He was a former astronaut, the first American to ever orbit the Earth. At the age of 77, when he said he wanted to fly again, NASA made an exception. LADWIG: I mean, the media turned out in droves for that mission. The public loved it. He's a national hero, was a national hero. GREENFIELDBOYCE: For people who weren't astronauts or national heroes, the only option for years was paying millions of dollars to Russia. Its space agency sold trips to space stations to a TV journalist from Japan, a bunch of businessmen turned space tourists and, just last week, an actress and movie director. Now, though, Russia has competition from U. S. companies. Virgin Galactic and Blue Origin both offer short flights that have minutes of weightlessness, and SpaceX has a capsule that can orbit the planet for days. In recent months, these firms have taken a motley assortment of people to space, what \"Saturday Night Live\" called random weirdos.

MCCAMMON: Their study, out today in the journal PLOS Biology, provides a clue as to why snakes exploded in number. It wasn't just all the empty space the dinosaurs left behind. It was the snakes' ability to snack on an ever-expanding menu of different creatures. RABOSKY: Snakes have sort of managed to do this remarkable evolutionary explosion in - of diets that you don't see in other groups of reptiles.

RUANE: There's snakes that specialize in eating things like scorpions and centipedes, in eating freshly molted crayfish, caterpillars. There's snakes that eat nothing but worms and slugs.

But the authors of this study point out, we could just as easily call the Cenozoic the Age of Snakes because almost all the same things happen. I'm going to start referring to it as the Age of Snakes. I'm totally stealing it because I think it's a great term. MCCAMMON: It is a great term. It's official. We're now living in the Age of Snakes.

South Carolina Public Radio's Victoria Hansen reports. VICTORIA HANSEN, BYLINE: Thirty-six-year-old Kimberly Grice needed a walker during her final month of pregnancy just to get down the hall of her home near Myrtle Beach to a lavender nursery. KIMBERLY GRICE: This is her room here. Our family - our sister-in-law, brother-in-law - painted it for her. HANSEN: Kimberly struggled to hang up tiny clothes or organize a changing table. She had been hospitalized and on a ventilator. This after a trip to the emergency room in late July for what turned out to be COVID-19 pneumonia. Kimberly wasn't vaccinated. She feared it might hurt the baby. But doctors now insist it is safe. Kimberly's husband, Tory, shares the story she can't remember, including the question he was repeatedly asked in case of complications. TORY GRICE: What life would you want us to save first? And I'm like, huh? HANSEN: Doctors wanted to know, if something went wrong, whose life should they prioritize? Kimberly's or the baby's? T GRICE: What you want to say is, like, both of them, but that can't be the answer. HANSEN: Kimberly's liver appeared to be failing. Doctors considered an emergency C-section but decided not to deliver the baby nine weeks early. When Kimberly came to, it was nearly September, and she was confused. How did she wind up in a Charleston hospital? And who were the doctors and nurses now in her room? K GRICE: And they're like, I just need to see you. They're like, you were so sick. They're like, you're a miracle. HANSEN: Kimberly's body was worn out, but she has since given birth to a healthy baby girl. REBECCA WINELAND: The risk of putting your life at risk, your unborn child's life at risk is not worth it. HANSEN: Dr. Rebecca Wineland is the director of labor and delivery at the Medical University of South Carolina. She has seen firsthand what the CDC warns - expecting mothers infected with the fast-spreading Delta variant are twice as likely to be admitted to the ICU and have a 70% increased risk of death. Dr. Wineland understands the reluctance of pregnant women like Kimberly to get the vaccine, admitting there hasn't been a clear message about its safety for both mother and baby until now. WINELAND: It will absolutely save your life and decrease your risk of hospitalization if you were to get COVID. HANSEN: But that message came too late for Scott Baisley and his 2-month-old son, Sullivan. (SOUNDBITE OF BABY CRYING)SCOTT BAISLEY: It's OK - gotcha. HANSEN: Scott's wife, Clair, was 33 weeks pregnant when she collapsed on the floor within days of being diagnosed with COVID. She was quickly hospitalized with double pneumonia. A week later, doctors decided they had to deliver Sullivan by C-section. Clair was put on a ventilator and given a 10% chance to live. Less than a month after her diagnosis, doctors were desperately trying to save Clair. BAISLEY: But that was it. That was - I just watched her numbers drop. I watched her blood oxygen continue to go down. I watched her heart rate increase. HANSEN: Suddenly, Clair was gone. She never got to hold Sullivan. BAISLEY: Having a son without a mother has been one the most painful things I've ever experienced. HANSEN: A pain Scott doesn't want anyone else to have to endure.

Kimberly's husband, Tory, shares the story she can't remember, including the question he was repeatedly asked in case of complications. TORY GRICE: What life would you want us to save first? And I'm like, huh? HANSEN: Doctors wanted to know, if something went wrong, whose life should they prioritize? Kimberly's or the baby's? T GRICE: What you want to say is, like, both of them, but that can't be the answer. HANSEN: Kimberly's liver appeared to be failing. Doctors considered an emergency C-section but decided not to deliver the baby nine weeks early. When Kimberly came to, it was nearly September, and she was confused. How did she wind up in a Charleston hospital? And who were the doctors and nurses now in her room? K GRICE: And they're like, I just need to see you. They're like, you were so sick. They're like, you're a miracle. HANSEN: Kimberly's body was worn out, but she has since given birth to a healthy baby girl. REBECCA WINELAND: The risk of putting your life at risk, your unborn child's life at risk is not worth it. HANSEN: Dr. Rebecca Wineland is the director of labor and delivery at the Medical University of South Carolina. She has seen firsthand what the CDC warns - expecting mothers infected with the fast-spreading Delta variant are twice as likely to be admitted to the ICU and have a 70% increased risk of death. Dr. Wineland understands the reluctance of pregnant women like Kimberly to get the vaccine, admitting there hasn't been a clear message about its safety for both mother and baby until now. WINELAND: It will absolutely save your life and decrease your risk of hospitalization if you were to get COVID. HANSEN: But that message came too late for Scott Baisley and his 2-month-old son, Sullivan. (SOUNDBITE OF BABY CRYING) SCOTT BAISLEY: It's OK - gotcha. HANSEN: Scott's wife, Clair, was 33 weeks pregnant when she collapsed on the floor within days of being diagnosed with COVID. She was quickly hospitalized with double pneumonia. A week later, doctors decided they had to deliver Sullivan by C-section. Clair was put on a ventilator and given a 10% chance to live. Less than a month after her diagnosis, doctors were desperately trying to save Clair. BAISLEY: But that was it. That was - I just watched her numbers drop. I watched her blood oxygen continue to go down. I watched her heart rate increase. HANSEN: Suddenly, Clair was gone. She never got to hold Sullivan. BAISLEY: Having a son without a mother has been one the most painful things I've ever experienced. HANSEN: A pain Scott doesn't want anyone else to have to endure.

NPR's Dan Charles explains what it will and will not achieve. DAN CHARLES, BYLINE: This is probably the most important meeting on the climate since six years ago in Paris, when 190-some countries agreed on drastic action to prevent the worst effects of planetary warming. This is like a midterm exam to see where countries stand. Rachel Kyte, who is dean of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, says they're failing. RACHEL KYTE: We're still not on track. So there's a gap. There's an emissions gap, and there's an ambition gap, and there's a finance gap. CHARLES: Countries set a very specific target in Paris - keep the planet from heating up more than 1 1/2 degrees Celsius - 2. 7 degrees Fahrenheit - compared to pre-industrial times. That will now require immediate cuts in global greenhouse emissions, bringing them practically to zero within about 30 years. KYTE: We don't have any time. We just don't have any time. The science is so compelling about how quickly we are risking really extreme events if we don't get a handle on our emissions. CHARLES: Countries won't be negotiating directly with each other in Glasgow over how much fossil fuel they burn. The way the Paris Agreement works, it's up to each country to submit its own emission-cutting plan as a contribution toward that overall goal. It's like a GoFundMe for the planet. Christiana Figueres, the former climate chief for the United Nations, says in Glasgow everybody will see what those contributions add up to. CHRISTIANA FIGUERES: We're going to come around the table. We're going to be transparent with each other. We're going to say what we did and, above all, what more are we going to do. CHARLES: Climate advocates are looking for better offers from China, Australia, India. The Biden administration has promised big cuts in America's emissions, but Congress isn't approving some of the most important programs to achieve that goal. Figueres says there is still some good news in all this. The plans the countries have turned in so far will make a real difference - if countries carry them out. Instead of the planet heating up, say, 3 or 4 degrees Celsius, this scenario predicts warming of just over 2 degrees C - less catastrophic. FIGUERES: We are making progress. We're not at the level that we should be, but we're moving in that direction. CHARLES: She admits, though, the political conditions for this event are really tough. The U. S. and China aren't getting along, and a lot of poorer countries are angry. As part of the Paris Agreement, they were supposed to get $100 billion a year to help them cope with climate change and also develop carbon-free energy sources. That hasn't happened. Chukwumerije Okereke, director of the Centre for Climate Change and Development in Nigeria, says countries like his are experiencing droughts, more intense cyclones, rising oceans. CHUKWUMERIJE OKEREKE: These poor countries are having to live with the impact of climate change on a daily basis. And make no mistake about it - they're not responsible for this problem. CHARLES: They will be pushing for more solid commitments and more money. Over the past decade, these almost-annual diplomatic meetings have turned into public extravaganzas, with tens of thousands of business executives and activists, like a session of Congress, a trade show and a political demonstration all in one. And Rachel Kyte from the Fletcher School says this event itself has become a force that pushes corporations and even governments to act. KYTE: There is huge pressure from civil society, from the public, from investors, from politicians to, you know, go to Glasgow with something. CHARLES: They'll show up and make their own promises to cut greenhouse emissions. But Kyte says these climate meetings are not like a World Series game where somebody hits a walk-off home run and it's over. It's like an Iditarod, she says - long and arduous.

S. national security in very concrete ways. The DOD offers that warning even as key parts of President Biden's climate agenda may not be included in the final build back better plan. Yesterday, I talked to Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks, who said the entire government needs to move on this. KATHLEEN HICKS: We need to have the rest of the government with us. We can't do it just here at DOD. And so we're really dependent on Congress understanding these national security implications and helping us take a major step change forward. KING: The DOD's climate action plan was released last week. And it essentially says, this will get worse if we don't do more. HICKS: Climate change is really increasing the number and frequency of missions that we're executing here at DOD. Let's look at firefighting. Severe drought has led to increasing fire seasons, lengthening of fire seasons. It's to the point where our National Guard bureau chief has started to talk about fire season becoming fire year. And, in fact. . . KING: Wow. HICKS: . . . We have, in the last five years, gone from about 14,000 personnel days for U. S. National Guard members to, in 2021, about 176,000 person days spent just on firefighting. You can also think about the increasing openness of the Arctic region, which China and Russia and lots of countries are up there now in the Arctic and creating a new geopolitical space that didn't used to exist, space for competition in an area that we have to make sure we're monitoring both for search and rescue just for simple commercial fleets that are going through there, where we're protecting freedom of the seas. That increases mission space for us. KING: What caught my attention was that four of the 11 countries that this report lists as most vulnerable to climate change are in Latin America. They are close to the United States. We know that we have many, many people coming to the U. S. already, escaping the effects of climate change and also other things - poverty, violence. But I wonder, as you look at those four out of 11 countries, how much of a problem do you see for the United States in terms of what is now often called climate migration? HICKS: Climate migration is absolutely affecting the United States directly as you're pointing out, at our southern border through the Northern Triangle countries, where farmers can't grow crops. Their traditional approaches to sustaining livelihood are very challenged. We have also seen that happen, of course, from Africa going up into Europe, other regions of the world. If you switch your lens to somewhere like the Pacific region - where the challenge is not so much drought, it's about sea level rise - there are Pacific island nations that are in an existential crisis. And they may go underwater. Think of Bangladesh. Think of portions of India, Indonesia, very populated countries where that scale of climate migration potential is significant. KING: This, then, sounds like rather a small point compared to the civilian toll that you're talking about. But I wonder, is the U. S. military thinking that in the near future, it will have to close bases in some places because of rising seas or because of droughts that make living in a particular area untenable? HICKS: We are absolutely looking at the implications of climate change on our installations. I will stress that drought is also a significant factor in and around our military installations out West, sea level rise mostly affecting us on the East Coast and overseas. So yes, the effect is, can we even operate where we have made ourself, where we've invested to operate? What kind of mitigations do we have to put in place to deal with these factors, you know, frequent fire, loss of power through frequent storms like we saw in the deep freeze in Texas? That's very costly. And it takes us away - again, for those forces that are located in those locations, they aren't focusing on mission. They're not flying on their training days, perhaps. Or they're not out to sea or getting prepared to go out to sea. Rather, they're moving in and out for storm purposes. All of those are ways that we both are reduced in our ability to do our main mission. And it costs us money to repair. KING: The Department of Defense can't change the weather, so what is your plan? HICKS: If there's one thing we do exceptionally well here at DOD it's we do plan. And we do it very thoroughly. And climate needs to be a part of how we think about the future and different contingencies we could get called into. We also are going to be working very closely with our interagency partners on making sure we're part of building back better here in the United States and on our installations abroad. We're going to be thinking about. How we train and equip our force in a climate environment. We're going to make sure we have our installation infrastructure built in a resilient way. We're going to make sure we have resilient supply chains, that we're being innovative, that we're tapping into areas like green technology here in the United States - and that we're collaborating with the private sector, with partners overseas and other government agencies in our research and development in ways ahead.

They've been traveling for so long that they have left our solar system. Amazingly, they still talk to Earth. But of course, their hardware can't last forever, so NASA is trying to figure out what to do once they can't communicate anymore. Here's NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE, BYLINE: The Voyagers were originally built to last about five years. Their mission was to visit Jupiter and Saturn. But since they kept working, they saw Uranus and Neptune, too. They've done all that by the time Stella Ocker was born 25 years ago. STELLA OCKER: I certainly didn't know much about it when I was growing up. I think I'd heard vaguely about the Golden Records. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Ah, the Golden Records. One was put on board each spacecraft because scientists knew even if the instruments died, these probes would keep moving farther out into space. They might even bump into some aliens. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED CHILD: Hello from the children of planet Earth. GREENFIELDBOYCE: The records contained greetings in many languages, plus a collection of Earth sounds. (SOUNDBITE OF TRAIN AMBIENCE)GREENFIELDBOYCE: Like that train, a barking dog, a kiss. The Golden Records are now just a part of what Ocker knows about the Voyagers. She's a graduate student at Cornell University, and her research relies on data that the spacecraft are still sending back. Voyager 1 is over 14 billion miles away. Voyager 2 is more than 11 billion miles away. Ocker says, to the casual observer, it would look like they're moving through black nothingness. OCKER: The interstellar medium seems like it's empty, but it's really not. It's full of gas and dust and cosmic rays, energetic particles. GREENFIELDBOYCE: She says this mysterious territory is important for understanding our own solar system, the universe. OCKER: There's still huge gaps in our knowledge that can really only be filled by direct sampling. GREENFIELDBOYCE: The Voyagers have been doing that. Unfortunately, their plutonium power source is ebbing away. RALPH MCNUTT: We're looking at which instrument gets to have all of their heaters turned off first because we're just flat running out of power. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Ralph McNutt works at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. MCNUTT: I'm still on the Voyager science team (laughter). I think I'm the youngest one on the Voyager science team. GREENFIELDBOYCE: At least the youngest who's been around since its beginning. He's 68 this week. He says the Voyagers will run out of power in nine years or so. That's why NASA recently asked McNutt and a team of scientists to make plans for a successor mission. The team has come up with a reasonably priced practical spacecraft, one that relies on technology that's either tried and true or already far along in development. MCNUTT: And right now we're looking at, pragmatically, being able to go about twice as fast as Voyager 1 and plan for lasting at least 50 years, and that'll get us out to about 375 astronomical units. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Three-hundred-and-seventy-five astronomical units is more than twice as far as Voyager 1 is, and this new spacecraft would have better instruments. MCNUTT: A lot of things that we know now that it would have been nice to have had on Voyager, but the technology either didn't exist or Voyager was a 4-1/2-year mission to Jupiter and Saturn, so why would you fly those things? GREENFIELDBOYCE: Remember; it's just a happy accident that the Voyagers stayed alive long enough to send back information about interstellar space.

She'd also love for it to carry some kind of contemporary take on the Golden Records, some kind of time capsule that reflects the planet Earth and humanity as it is today. Nell Greenfieldboyce, NPR News. NOEL KING, HOST:   NASA's two Voyager spacecrafts launched in 1977. They've been traveling for so long that they have left our solar system. Amazingly, they still talk to Earth. But of course, their hardware can't last forever, so NASA is trying to figure out what to do once they can't communicate anymore. Here's NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE, BYLINE: The Voyagers were originally built to last about five years. Their mission was to visit Jupiter and Saturn. But since they kept working, they saw Uranus and Neptune, too. They've done all that by the time Stella Ocker was born 25 years ago. STELLA OCKER: I certainly didn't know much about it when I was growing up. I think I'd heard vaguely about the Golden Records. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Ah, the Golden Records. One was put on board each spacecraft because scientists knew even if the instruments died, these probes would keep moving farther out into space. They might even bump into some aliens. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED CHILD: Hello from the children of planet Earth. GREENFIELDBOYCE: The records contained greetings in many languages, plus a collection of Earth sounds. (SOUNDBITE OF TRAIN AMBIENCE) GREENFIELDBOYCE: Like that train, a barking dog, a kiss. The Golden Records are now just a part of what Ocker knows about the Voyagers. She's a graduate student at Cornell University, and her research relies on data that the spacecraft are still sending back. Voyager 1 is over 14 billion miles away. Voyager 2 is more than 11 billion miles away. Ocker says, to the casual observer, it would look like they're moving through black nothingness. OCKER: The interstellar medium seems like it's empty, but it's really not. It's full of gas and dust and cosmic rays, energetic particles. GREENFIELDBOYCE: She says this mysterious territory is important for understanding our own solar system, the universe. OCKER: There's still huge gaps in our knowledge that can really only be filled by direct sampling. GREENFIELDBOYCE: The Voyagers have been doing that. Unfortunately, their plutonium power source is ebbing away. RALPH MCNUTT: We're looking at which instrument gets to have all of their heaters turned off first because we're just flat running out of power. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Ralph McNutt works at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. MCNUTT: I'm still on the Voyager science team (laughter). I think I'm the youngest one on the Voyager science team. GREENFIELDBOYCE: At least the youngest who's been around since its beginning. He's 68 this week. He says the Voyagers will run out of power in nine years or so. That's why NASA recently asked McNutt and a team of scientists to make plans for a successor mission. The team has come up with a reasonably priced practical spacecraft, one that relies on technology that's either tried and true or already far along in development. MCNUTT: And right now we're looking at, pragmatically, being able to go about twice as fast as Voyager 1 and plan for lasting at least 50 years, and that'll get us out to about 375 astronomical units. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Three-hundred-and-seventy-five astronomical units is more than twice as far as Voyager 1 is, and this new spacecraft would have better instruments. MCNUTT: A lot of things that we know now that it would have been nice to have had on Voyager, but the technology either didn't exist or Voyager was a 4-1/2-year mission to Jupiter and Saturn, so why would you fly those things? GREENFIELDBOYCE: Remember; it's just a happy accident that the Voyagers stayed alive long enough to send back information about interstellar space. This new probe, in contrast, would be deliberately designed to go the distance. It would have the longest planned duration of any NASA mission ever. Fifty years would be the minimum.

However, they cannot, in fact, compete with whales, the largest animals ever to have lived on Earth. Blue whales can be almost 100 feet long, and they have a whale of an appetite. NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce reports on a new study showing that scientists have long underestimated just how much these giants can eat. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE, BYLINE: Certain whales, like blue, fin and humpback whales, eat huge quantities of tiny shrimp like krill. These whales gulp big mouthfuls of water and use bristly plates in their mouths to filter out the prey. Matthew Savoca is a biologist at Stanford University. He recently wondered, how much can these whales gobble down? MATTHEW SAVOCA: I remember thinking, oh, well, we must know this. You know, this is something that seems like a basic question, and these are some of the most charismatic animals really in the history of life on Earth. GREENFIELDBOYCE: He says if you just Google, how much does a blue whale eat? - you'll get an answer, but. . . SAVOCA: What I was surprised to find out is when I dug into where that answer came from, it didn't actually come from living, breathing whales in the wild. GREENFIELDBOYCE: All he could find were guesses based on extrapolations from the caloric needs of smaller animals or the stomach contents of dead whales that had been hunted. SAVOCA: But, of course, that's just a snapshot from, you know, a morning of feeding or something like that, depending on when the whale was caught. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Savoca realized that it was possible to get much better estimates by monitoring tagged whales as they fed on swarms of krill. He and his colleagues used underwater devices that can measure the size and density of a swarm by sending out pulses of sound. SAVOCA: And then the instrument listens to the returning echoes reflected back. GREENFIELDBOYCE: His group tracked hundreds of whales as they chowed down. The results in the journal Nature show that on average, these whales eat way more than expected - three times more. In just one day, a blue whale can eat between 10 and 20 tons of food. SAVOCA: That amount of food is somewhere in the range of 20 to 50 million calories, which, you know, it's a lot of calories. And that is about 70- to 80,000 Big Macs. GREENFIELDBOYCE: It's the equivalent of what a person would eat over decades. He says, given how much whale populations can eat. . . SAVOCA: How are these whales going to be able to recover when it appears that, at this time, they are food-limited? GREENFIELDBOYCE: Krill populations have dramatically declined in recent decades. Some scientists blame the loss of whales that not only ate lots of food, but also made enormous amounts of poop. Whale poop contains iron and other nutrients. It fertilizes the ocean and helps krill. Asha de Vos is the founder of Oceanswell, a marine conservation group in Sri Lanka. She says some researchers have talked about artificially fertilizing the ocean to boost krill and give whales more food. ASHA DE VOS: I think it's really complicated, and I do think that unless it's done well, it can actually have unintended consequences that could be negative. GREENFIELDBOYCE: And, she says, there's plenty of other ways to help whales, like protecting them from getting hit by ships or tangled in floating nets. Nell Greenfieldboyce, NPR News.

(APPLAUSE)UNIDENTIFIED CHILD #1: Did it hurt? MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:  No, the boy shook his head, it did not hurt.

I am. UNIDENTIFIED CHILD #2: I'm going third. KELLY: It happened at Hartford Health Care in Connecticut hours after the CDC made things official Tuesday night authorizing a Pfizer vaccine for kids ages 5 to 11. KELLY: CDC Director Rochelle Walensky made the final call after recommendations by two different advisory panels at the FDA and CDC. She told NPR the next day, those panels reviewed data that say the kids vaccine, which is one-third the dosage of the adult version, is 91% effective. It is safe. In fact, in clinical trials, including several thousand children. . . ROCHELLE WALENSKY: There was not a single case of a severe side effect from this vaccine. KELLY: Public health officials believe it is not just kids who will benefit. Getting them vaccinated could help keep the pandemic on a downward trajectory as the U. S. gets closer to winter and with more than a thousand Americans still dying from COVID-19 every day. WALENSKY: And that's too high. So we are really asking people to do the hard work of getting themselves vaccinated, getting their children vaccinated and continuing to practice those prevention strategies that we know work. KELLY: CONSIDER THIS - 28 million kids are now vaccine eligible, and pediatricians tell NPR, parents and caretakers should not wait to get kids a shot. Coming up, we'll hear from children and their parents about that decision. From NPR, I'm Mary Louise Kelly. It is Thursday, November 4. It's CONSIDER THIS FROM NPR. Just like for adults, vaccines for kids will make it possible to get out in the world with a lower risk of infection. SARAH MORRISON: Do you want to go bowling. . . CHLOE: Yes. MORRISON: . . . Or to the movies? CHLOE: Movie. MORRISON: What about doing kindergarten without a mask? CHLOE: Kindergarten without a mask. KELLY: That is 5-year-old Chloe and her mom, Sarah Morrison, from Asheville, N. C. MORRISON: Chloe, do you want to talk about why it's important to get the coronavirus shot? CHLOE: So you don't get sick. KELLY: Sarah told NPR, she plans to get Chloe the vaccine so they can feel safer doing the fun stuff they used to do as a family pre-pandemic. Chloe is on board. MORRISON: Chloe, what would you tell other little kids who have to get the coronavirus shot? CHLOE: That it's OK if you cry. MORRISON: Yeah. CHLOE: It will feel like a little pinch. MORRISON: Yeah. Do you think you'll cry when you get it? CHLOE: Yes. MORRISON: Yeah. But what else will you be? CHLOE: Brave. MORRISON: Yeah. Are you brave? CHLOE: Yes. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)KELLY: For Chloe and millions of kids across the country, the vaccine should be rolled out at full capacity by next week. It'll be two shots three weeks apart, just like the adult version of the Pfizer vaccine, and it will be available at more than 20,000 sites across the country, CDC Director Walensky told NPR. WALENSKY: So we're distributing the vaccine to pediatricians offices. It'll be in pharmacies. It'll be in federally qualified health centers. And that's where people are getting their children vaccinated. KELLY: Pediatricians and scientists say it is better not to wait to make that call. While most childhood COVID cases are mild, at least 170 children in the U. S. , ages 5 to 11, have died from the disease. And pediatricians point to real-world data on the effectiveness of vaccines in older kids between 12 and 17. For instance, amid the recent delta surge, hospitalization rates were about 10 times higher in unvaccinated adolescents than vaccinated ones. And it is true a lot of kids have already been infected. By one CDC count, as many as 38% of kids age 5 to 11 have antibodies. But scientists don't fully understand how long those antibodies last or how protective they are. ANTHONY FAUCI: And there are some very good studies in adults - albeit not in children - but in adults, that if you get infected and recover from the infection and then get vaccinated, the level of your protection is dramatically enhanced. KELLY: Dr. Anthony Fauci, the White House's chief medical adviser. He spoke to NPR this past week. He addressed one question parents and caretakers might have about a vaccine side effect called myocarditis, or inflammation in the heart. It was not seen in Pfizer's studies of its vaccine for 5- to 11-year-olds, but there have been rare cases of it in older kids, more boys than girls. FAUCI: The myocarditis that has been seen is a rare, adverse event predominantly in young men, not generally as young as 5 to 11, but there certainly could be some overlap there. So that's something that you pay attention to. But. . . (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)KELLY: In most instances, kids with the condition improve quickly. And importantly, it can also be caused by COVID itself. COVID can also lead to heart problems in kids with something called MIS-C. That stands for multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. It's a condition linked to COVID-19 that can send children to the ICU. More than 5,000 children and teens have developed it, and the median age of kids with MIS-C is 9 years old. FAUCI: When the FDA looks at the data and they do a risk-benefit analysis, which is what is the risk of getting COVID-19 and getting a serious outcome versus the risk of getting the adverse event from the vaccine, they've determined very clearly that they weigh very heavily towards the benefit as opposed to the risk. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)KELLY: According to a recent Kaiser Family Foundation survey, when it comes to vaccinating their kids, there are three types of parents - about a third are eager to do it ASAP, a third have more of a wait-and-see approach and a third say no, not now, not ever. Colorado Public Radio's Jenny Brundin found parents from all three of those groups in Denver, where she also spoke to some of their kids. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Green light. JOHN THOMAS BARTON IV: Yay. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: (Laughter). JENNY BRUNDIN, BYLINE: The first kid I ask about whether or not he'll get the COVID vaccine isJOHN: John Thomas Barton IV. BRUNDIN: What was that again? JOHN: John Thomas Barton IV. BRUNDIN: That's John Thomas Barton IV, who is in fourth grade and has already had four other immunizations. JOHN: Four, so I already know what the pain is going to feel like. I really want to get this vaccine because then I know if anyone has COVID, I won't. My system will be able to fight it. BRUNDIN: A recent poll by Ipsos shows 2 in 3 parents of 5- to 11-year-olds plan to get their kids vaccinated. Cree Mortensen is not one of them. CREE MORTENSEN: It's just not something I trust right now - maybe later, but not right now, no. BRUNDIN: Mortensen says she's researched the vaccine and has thought a lot about it. She got COVID once. Her vaccinated mom got a breakthrough case three months ago and is still having trouble breathing. But to Mortensen, that just means. . . MORTENSEN: I'm going to get it either way. Like (laughter) you know, it's like the flu, so. . . BRUNDIN: But she says she won't stop her son, who's in second grade, if he wants the vaccine. I head to another park. JAVIER TOUSSAINT: Siouxrulean, Jakil, come here real quick, baby. BRUNDIN: Javier Toussaint is vaccinated. He has five children. He's frustrated that some people won't listen to the experts, the scientists and doctors. He says he'd never argue with his mechanic. TOUSSAINT: If I take my car in there and he's like, look, the transmission is shot, and I don't even know how you made it here, I'm not going to sit there and be like, it's my pistons. And so I'm not with people doing that to doctors. BRUNDIN: Doctors have helped out his 11-year-old, who has the sickle cell trait. She's healthy but has had her spleen taken out, which is part of the immune system. TOUSSAINT: As soon as they make it available for somebody in her spectrum, immediately. BRUNDIN: The Ipsos poll shows Black parents are significantly more concerned about their kids getting COVID than whites. Toussaint says he wishes more people understood that some things we do are for the community, just like this playground. Parents like Katti Evans agree. She says children aren't politicizing this, adults are by insisting. . . KATTI EVANS: Either I'm right or else. And that's not how a community works together to protect our kids. We're putting our egos in front of our children's futures, and I don't think that's right. BRUNDIN: For her, vaccines will keep children learning inside schools and will lessen teachers' anxiety. EVANS: You know, not having to go home with this anxiety every single day about which kid brought COVID to school today. BRUNDIN: Chevelle is her 9-year-old daughter. CHEVELLE: I'm not a big fan of needles, but I do want to be more safe, so I don't really know what to say - like, maybe half and half. BRUNDIN: But she says she knows it will keep her safe. She'll eventually get it. CHEVELLE: Probably not right away, right away. BRUNDIN: But a bit down the road. Her mom agrees. They'll wait a bit to see how the rollout goes. UNIDENTIFIED CHILD #4: I tagged you. I tagged you. I tagged you. BRUNDIN: Other parents seem overwhelmed by the avalanche of opinions swirling around, so much so they've just withdrawn. JUANITA GONZALEZ: We don't really think about the COVID because I think it sucks you in. Like, it makes you nervous. It makes you scared if you watch the news. It's just chaotic. BRUNDIN: Juanita Gonzalez, mother of a 10- and 12-year-old, says she feels better not engaging. She wants to wait until she feels 100% certain. GONZALEZ: When I make that decision for my family to get vaccinated, I want to feel comfortable for myself and for my family, not because everybody else is doing it, not because hurry, hurry, do it, you know? BRUNDIN: For other kids and families, they are ready now because it's a chance to get back to normal. For the past year and a half, some families have done everything except school outside. No movies, no restaurants, no indoor play dates. Here's 10-year-old Vivien Jones quizzing her friend Esther Colburn, also 10. VIVIEN JONES: What do you think you're going to do after you get both vaccines? ESTHER COLBURN: Have a sleepover, paint my nails and get my ears pierced. VIVIEN: Do you think you're going to go to friends' houses after you get the vaccine? ESTHER: Are you asking this because you want a sleepover? BRUNDIN: Whether it's about the sleepovers or to keep rising numbers of kids out of the hospital, 28 million children will be waiting for their parents or guardians to decide. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)KELLY: Jenny Brundin of Colorado Public Radio. A lot of what you heard earlier this episode came from the work of our colleagues at NPR's Science Desk - Carmel Wroth, Allison Aubrey and Selena Simmons-Duffin. They have a really thorough write-up of everything you need to know, answers to all your questions about young kids and the vaccine. There's a link to that in our episode notes. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)KELLY: It's CONSIDER THIS from NPR. I'm Mary Louise Kelly. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: All done. (APPLAUSE) UNIDENTIFIED CHILD #1: Did it hurt? MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:   No, the boy shook his head, it did not hurt. Well, that boy was one of the first kids under 12 in the country to get a COVID-19 vaccine. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED CHILD #2: I'm going second. UNIDENTIFIED CHILD #3: No, I am. I am. UNIDENTIFIED CHILD #2: I'm going third. KELLY: It happened at Hartford Health Care in Connecticut hours after the CDC made things official Tuesday night authorizing a Pfizer vaccine for kids ages 5 to 11. KELLY: CDC Director Rochelle Walensky made the final call after recommendations by two different advisory panels at the FDA and CDC. She told NPR the next day, those panels reviewed data that say the kids vaccine, which is one-third the dosage of the adult version, is 91% effective. It is safe. In fact, in clinical trials, including several thousand children. . . ROCHELLE WALENSKY: There was not a single case of a severe side effect from this vaccine. KELLY: Public health officials believe it is not just kids who will benefit. Getting them vaccinated could help keep the pandemic on a downward trajectory as the U. S. gets closer to winter and with more than a thousand Americans still dying from COVID-19 every day. WALENSKY: And that's too high. So we are really asking people to do the hard work of getting themselves vaccinated, getting their children vaccinated and continuing to practice those prevention strategies that we know work. KELLY: CONSIDER THIS - 28 million kids are now vaccine eligible, and pediatricians tell NPR, parents and caretakers should not wait to get kids a shot. Coming up, we'll hear from children and their parents about that decision. From NPR, I'm Mary Louise Kelly. It is Thursday, November 4. It's CONSIDER THIS FROM NPR. Just like for adults, vaccines for kids will make it possible to get out in the world with a lower risk of infection. SARAH MORRISON: Do you want to go bowling. . . CHLOE: Yes. MORRISON: . . . Or to the movies? CHLOE: Movie. MORRISON: What about doing kindergarten without a mask? CHLOE: Kindergarten without a mask. KELLY: That is 5-year-old Chloe and her mom, Sarah Morrison, from Asheville, N. C. MORRISON: Chloe, do you want to talk about why it's important to get the coronavirus shot? CHLOE: So you don't get sick. KELLY: Sarah told NPR, she plans to get Chloe the vaccine so they can feel safer doing the fun stuff they used to do as a family pre-pandemic. Chloe is on board. MORRISON: Chloe, what would you tell other little kids who have to get the coronavirus shot? CHLOE: That it's OK if you cry. MORRISON: Yeah. CHLOE: It will feel like a little pinch. MORRISON: Yeah. Do you think you'll cry when you get it? CHLOE: Yes. MORRISON: Yeah. But what else will you be? CHLOE: Brave. MORRISON: Yeah. Are you brave? CHLOE: Yes. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) KELLY: For Chloe and millions of kids across the country, the vaccine should be rolled out at full capacity by next week. It'll be two shots three weeks apart, just like the adult version of the Pfizer vaccine, and it will be available at more than 20,000 sites across the country, CDC Director Walensky told NPR. WALENSKY: So we're distributing the vaccine to pediatricians offices. It'll be in pharmacies. It'll be in federally qualified health centers. And that's where people are getting their children vaccinated. KELLY: Pediatricians and scientists say it is better not to wait to make that call. While most childhood COVID cases are mild, at least 170 children in the U. S. , ages 5 to 11, have died from the disease. And pediatricians point to real-world data on the effectiveness of vaccines in older kids between 12 and 17. For instance, amid the recent delta surge, hospitalization rates were about 10 times higher in unvaccinated adolescents than vaccinated ones. And it is true a lot of kids have already been infected. By one CDC count, as many as 38% of kids age 5 to 11 have antibodies. But scientists don't fully understand how long those antibodies last or how protective they are. ANTHONY FAUCI: And there are some very good studies in adults - albeit not in children - but in adults, that if you get infected and recover from the infection and then get vaccinated, the level of your protection is dramatically enhanced. KELLY: Dr. Anthony Fauci, the White House's chief medical adviser. He spoke to NPR this past week. He addressed one question parents and caretakers might have about a vaccine side effect called myocarditis, or inflammation in the heart. It was not seen in Pfizer's studies of its vaccine for 5- to 11-year-olds, but there have been rare cases of it in older kids, more boys than girls. FAUCI: The myocarditis that has been seen is a rare, adverse event predominantly in young men, not generally as young as 5 to 11, but there certainly could be some overlap there. So that's something that you pay attention to. But. . . (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) KELLY: In most instances, kids with the condition improve quickly. And importantly, it can also be caused by COVID itself. COVID can also lead to heart problems in kids with something called MIS-C. That stands for multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. It's a condition linked to COVID-19 that can send children to the ICU. More than 5,000 children and teens have developed it, and the median age of kids with MIS-C is 9 years old. FAUCI: When the FDA looks at the data and they do a risk-benefit analysis, which is what is the risk of getting COVID-19 and getting a serious outcome versus the risk of getting the adverse event from the vaccine, they've determined very clearly that they weigh very heavily towards the benefit as opposed to the risk. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) KELLY: According to a recent Kaiser Family Foundation survey, when it comes to vaccinating their kids, there are three types of parents - about a third are eager to do it ASAP, a third have more of a wait-and-see approach and a third say no, not now, not ever. Colorado Public Radio's Jenny Brundin found parents from all three of those groups in Denver, where she also spoke to some of their kids. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Green light. JOHN THOMAS BARTON IV: Yay. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: (Laughter). JENNY BRUNDIN, BYLINE: The first kid I ask about whether or not he'll get the COVID vaccine is JOHN: John Thomas Barton IV. BRUNDIN: What was that again? JOHN: John Thomas Barton IV. BRUNDIN: That's John Thomas Barton IV, who is in fourth grade and has already had four other immunizations. JOHN: Four, so I already know what the pain is going to feel like. I really want to get this vaccine because then I know if anyone has COVID, I won't. My system will be able to fight it. BRUNDIN: A recent poll by Ipsos shows 2 in 3 parents of 5- to 11-year-olds plan to get their kids vaccinated. Cree Mortensen is not one of them. CREE MORTENSEN: It's just not something I trust right now - maybe later, but not right now, no. BRUNDIN: Mortensen says she's researched the vaccine and has thought a lot about it. She got COVID once. Her vaccinated mom got a breakthrough case three months ago and is still having trouble breathing. But to Mortensen, that just means. . . MORTENSEN: I'm going to get it either way. Like (laughter) you know, it's like the flu, so. . . BRUNDIN: But she says she won't stop her son, who's in second grade, if he wants the vaccine. I head to another park. JAVIER TOUSSAINT: Siouxrulean, Jakil, come here real quick, baby. BRUNDIN: Javier Toussaint is vaccinated. He has five children. He's frustrated that some people won't listen to the experts, the scientists and doctors. He says he'd never argue with his mechanic. TOUSSAINT: If I take my car in there and he's like, look, the transmission is shot, and I don't even know how you made it here, I'm not going to sit there and be like, it's my pistons. And so I'm not with people doing that to doctors. BRUNDIN: Doctors have helped out his 11-year-old, who has the sickle cell trait. She's healthy but has had her spleen taken out, which is part of the immune system. TOUSSAINT: As soon as they make it available for somebody in her spectrum, immediately. BRUNDIN: The Ipsos poll shows Black parents are significantly more concerned about their kids getting COVID than whites. Toussaint says he wishes more people understood that some things we do are for the community, just like this playground. Parents like Katti Evans agree. She says children aren't politicizing this, adults are by insisting. . . KATTI EVANS: Either I'm right or else. And that's not how a community works together to protect our kids. We're putting our egos in front of our children's futures, and I don't think that's right. BRUNDIN: For her, vaccines will keep children learning inside schools and will lessen teachers' anxiety. EVANS: You know, not having to go home with this anxiety every single day about which kid brought COVID to school today. BRUNDIN: Chevelle is her 9-year-old daughter. CHEVELLE: I'm not a big fan of needles, but I do want to be more safe, so I don't really know what to say - like, maybe half and half. BRUNDIN: But she says she knows it will keep her safe. She'll eventually get it. CHEVELLE: Probably not right away, right away. BRUNDIN: But a bit down the road. Her mom agrees. They'll wait a bit to see how the rollout goes. UNIDENTIFIED CHILD #4: I tagged you. I tagged you. I tagged you. BRUNDIN: Other parents seem overwhelmed by the avalanche of opinions swirling around, so much so they've just withdrawn. JUANITA GONZALEZ: We don't really think about the COVID because I think it sucks you in. Like, it makes you nervous. It makes you scared if you watch the news. It's just chaotic.

SYLVIE DOUGLIS, BYLINE: This is PLANET MONEY from NPR. (SOUNDBITE OF COIN SPINNING)AMANDA ARONCZYK, HOST:  It's March 2020. Dr. Robert Kadlec, known by his colleagues as Dr. Bob, finds himself in the middle of the COVID crisis. And that's because last year, Dr. Bob, a former Air Force physician and bioweapons expert under George W. Bush, he is now the assistant secretary for preparedness and response at the Department of Health and Human Services, meaning that now that there is a pandemic, it's on Dr. Bob to deal with it. Remember what it was like a year and a half ago? There were not enough gloves, not enough masks, not enough PPE. There were no proven medicines for COVID, no vaccines. So Dr. Bob's portfolio of responsibilities was pretty large. So briefly, it's being prepared. . . ROBERT KADLEC: Being prepared. ARONCZYK: . . . The stockpile. . . KADLEC: The stockpile. ARONCZYK: . . . All the vaccines. KADLEC: And all the vaccines. ARONCZYK: So you're kind of a pandemic guy. KADLEC: Yeah, it's - that's a good way of putting it. ARONCZYK: Dr. Bob is the kind of person who turns to history for ideas. So he does what Dr. Bob does, and he starts to dig into the archives. There, he finds a technical manual from 1962 where researchers had tested what materials could be turned into an impromptu mask. KADLEC: There were things like using toilet paper folded over, using T-shirts and a variety of other products. ARONCZYK: And in this manual, he finds some pretty good evidence that, yes, cloth masks are effective. Dr. Bob's like, great. Cloth masks - let's do this. He calls up Hanes, and he convinces them to pivot from making underwear to making masks. They make an agreement, and he launches America Strong - Keep Healthy and Live On - which is a cloth mask initiative. KADLEC: Now, the color was somewhat controversial initially. ARONCZYK: The color was controversial. What color were they? KADLEC: Well, they were white because, you know, what you didn't want to have something is - somebody would have this mask and would never wash it. And so the idea that it was white would show dirt. ARONCZYK: Right. KADLEC: And then people would be self-conscious, and they would wash their mask. ARONCZYK: Function over fashion - that is so Dr. Bob. So he takes a slice out of his tiny budget to order 650 million white cotton masks from Hanes. KADLEC: They cost about 71 cents per mask. Shipping was about 62 cents with the Postal Service so that we could conceivably mail them to every residence in the United States. ARONCZYK: But you might've noticed you never got a pack of these America Strong masks in the mail. That's because they weren't sent. And even though the CDC liked the plan - so did Dr. Fauci, so did FEMA. . . KADLEC: When it came time to brief it to the audience at the White House task force, I didn't get even to the first slide. It was interrupted and stopped. ARONCZYK: What went wrong? KADLEC: Well, I'd like to know, too. ARONCZYK: Dr. Bob asks around, but he never gets a formal answer. Instead, he just hears trivial, gossipy comments about his mask. KADLEC: No one would wear them. No one wanted to use the Postal Service. Why were they white? You know, they look like underwear. ARONCZYK: That one's a little true. KADLEC: We never had the full debate, and it was pulled off the agenda and never to be surfaced again. ARONCZYK: There have been some studies since that suggest that his idea could have saved tens of thousands of lives. KADLEC: Yeah, that's the one thing that keeps me awake at night even today. With that not going forward, it was time to come up with another idea. ARONCZYK: Another idea, because if Dr. Bob can't slow the spread with masks, then he really has only one other option. He better get some vaccines made, and he better do it fast. (SOUNDBITE OF ADRIAN QUESADA, ERIC BURTON AND SKINNY WILLIAMS SONG, \"THE SOUL OF SHAOLIN\")ARONCZYK: Hello, and welcome to PLANET MONEY. I'm Amanda Aronczyk. ALEXI HOROWITZ-GHAZI, HOST:  And I'm Alexi Horowitz-Ghazi. Now that we have a few different COVID-19 vaccines, it might seem inevitable that it would happen this way. But a year and a half ago, when Dr. Bob first embarked on his mission, it felt impossible. ARONCZYK: Today on the show, Dr. Bob's next idea - Operation Warp Speed. This is the story behind the story of how the vaccines were made in record time. And one little, quick warning - this show is going to be a weird, trippy flashback. Like, was this last year? Was this a thousand years ago? There is no way to know for sure. (SOUNDBITE OF ADRIAN QUESADA, ERIC BURTON AND SKINNY WILLIAMS SONG, \"THE SOUL OF SHAOLIN\")ARONCZYK: It's April 2020, just a couple of days after Dr. Bob Kadlec's mask idea gets shot down, and he is feeling desperate. He is the government's pandemic guy, appointed by President Trump, responsible for making sure we have the medicines and vaccines we need. But he has got nothing. The medicine cabinet is bare. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: So he texts some of his closest colleagues and he says, can you please come meet with me? I've got this idea. Plus, I can offer you an incentive. KADLEC: Well, I think there were about three or four pizzas. They were from We, The Pizza on Capitol Hill. They deliver. They take American Express (laughter). ARONCZYK: Five of Dr. Bob's buddies bite. They show up to his windowless office on the sixth floor of the Hubert H. Humphrey Building for some pizza and brainstorming. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: This group knows that in the past, pharmaceutical companies haven't wanted to make vaccines for emerging diseases, new outbreaks because who knows how many people will need it? What if the outbreak just goes away? That's what happened with SARS and MERS and Zika. KADLEC: There was no one on the commercial side that was willing to invest the money for something that may or may not occur ever again. ARONCZYK: For the pharma companies, it's too unpredictable a market. They can't guarantee that they'll make a profit. So the big companies don't want to invest in something so risky, and the small companies don't necessarily have the money or experience to navigate all the hoops. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: So what about the government? KADLEC: The government can't manufacture vaccines. Now, we have tried historically, and in doing so, we have failed magnificently. ARONCZYK: In the past, the government has tried to be a maker of vaccines, to have labs and their own factories. But Dr. Bob says it was just too hard and too expensive for them to do well. KADLEC: They went through a variety of different analyses - some economic, some scientific and technical - and in the end realized that the wherewithal, the experience and expertise to make these things do not reside in the government. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: He says Big Pharma won't go alone and the government can't go alone. Then, in walks COVID-19, and now Dr. Bob has to find a way to get everyone to work together so something can get made, like, right, right now. ARONCZYK: Now again, Dr. Bob has turned to history to find a solution. He's standing in front of his buddies, and he takes a black marker, and he writes up on the whiteboard, Manhattan Project. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)HARRY TRUMAN: We have spent more than $2 billion on the greatest scientific gamble in history. ARONCZYK: This is President Harry Truman talking about the Manhattan Project, which was a secret program launched during the second world war to create an atomic bomb. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMAN: Both science and industry work together under the direction of the United States Army, which achieved a unique success in an amazingly short time. KADLEC: Obviously, we weren't making a bomb. We were trying to develop vaccines and therapeutics. But it was this idea that it would be a partnership with the U. S. government and the private sector to accelerate the speed of science and have a product at the end of that - in this case, a vaccine. ARONCZYK: So they need to accelerate the speed of science. But how? Dr. Bob and his colleagues discuss what the process usually takes. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: First, there's academic research, where they try to figure out exactly what it is they're making. ARONCZYK: Then there are preclinical trials, where they test it on mice and monkeys. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: That's followed by phase 1 trials, basically asking, is this thing safe? ARONCZYK: And then phase 2 trials, where they take a few more people and they see, OK, what's the right dosage? HOROWITZ-GHAZI: Finally, phase 3 trials. That's where they're going to get a ton of people and make sure this thing really works. ARONCZYK: And if it does, now they get it all approved by the FDA. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: Less than 10% of new drugs get that approval because at any point a vaccine or drug could fail. There's even a part of this whole journey that's known affectionately as the Valley of Death. ARONCZYK: The way things have been done in the past will not work for a respiratory virus that is quickly spreading around the world. Up until now, the fastest timeline for a new vaccine was four years. Thankfully, Dr. Bob knows someone at the FDA, Dr. Peter Marks. They patch him into the pizza party. KADLEC: Peter Marks, you know, came on the line, and we pitched him about this idea of accelerating the FDA approval cycle. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: Together, they come up with a bold solution. What if they were to run all the parts of the FDA process - the animal trials, the human trials, the data analysis - all roughly at the same time? KADLEC: It's basically taking a string, as linear as it is when you hold it end to end, and then folding it on itself to take the processes that are typically done sequentially and doing them in parallel. ARONCZYK: Dr. Bob loves this idea. And what if we could also manufacture the vaccine candidates while we're testing them? Now, in normal times, pharmaceutical companies wait until after the FDA gives approval to start manufacturing. Setting up a vaccine factory takes months or even years and millions of dollars. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: So Drs. Bob, Peter and company come up with another idea. What if the government pays companies to start manufacturing vaccines before they are approved? KADLEC: Yeah, your product may not get through the wickets, may not get through FDA approval, but we're going to pay you to develop this product, to manufacture it at scale. So that was going to be a role of the U. S. government was to assume the risk of manufacturing at risk. ARONCZYK: If a company manufactures a vaccine and it's found to not be safe or it doesn't work, they will dump it, but they won't have to eat the cost of making it. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: So Peter has ideas about how to make the FDA process move faster without compromising safety. And Dr. Bob has ideas about how to get the government and private companies to work together. They start to hatch a clear plan. KADLEC: It was kind of like the Reese's Peanut Butter Cup experience. I had the chocolate, he had the peanut butter, and together we were in business. ARONCZYK: They write up a mission statement, come up with a name. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: Project Peanut Butter Cup? ARONCZYK: No. They call it Project Warp Speed because \"Star Trek. \" Dr. Peter's a huge Trekkie. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: Aside from the Manhattan Project being their inspiration, they also copy the leadership structure. You might have heard of J. Robert Oppenheimer. He's often remembered as the head of the Manhattan Project. But there were actually two leads. Oppenheimer was the scientific lead, and Lieutenant General Leslie Groves was the operational lead. Dr. Bob wanted to do the same thing. ARONCZYK: So it would be a collaboration between the health department and the military. So they don't want to call it Project Warp Speed. The military doesn't do projects anymore. Projects are for the dorks over at NASA. Today's military, they do operations. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: Now all they have to do is get their idea approved by the White House. But there are not actually a lot of fans at the White House of Dr. Bob and his team - you know, the folks who ordered hundreds of millions of tighty-whities for your face. BRENDAN BORRELL: They were on the outs at that point. ARONCZYK: This is Brendan Borrell. He's a journalist, and he's the one who introduced me to Dr. Bob Kadlec. Brendan just published a book called \"The First Shots,\" and this episode is based on his reporting. BORRELL: Kadlec's boss was on the verge of getting fired, and so was Kadlec. And this is like a team of basically outcasts from the Trump administration, right? HOROWITZ-GHAZI: There's fighting going on between the White House and the health department over ventilators and PPE and testing. But this ragtag team of outcasts, they still need President Trump. BORRELL: For the program to work, because it is taking two branches of government, it needed the approval of the White House, and that came in the form of Jared Kushner, who, you know, is the president's son-in-law and, you know, known as the secretary of everything and had been kind of meddling in the pandemic response. And Kushner knew that it was important. And so he kind of provided the cover for it and the protection. So he took it to Trump, got Trump to say, yeah, this is a good idea. And at that point on, they were left to do their own thing. ARONCZYK: May 15, 2020, is the official launch of Operation Warp Speed. Dr. Bob was there. KADLEC: There was a Rose Garden ceremony at the White House, and I was invited to it, interesting enough. And so I got a front-row seat. And all I know - it was sweltering heat, and I'm just - and, of course, you had to get there early. And I'm just sitting in this chair, like, in a puddle of sweat. And I just remember meeting Dr. Slaoui for the first time that day. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: Dr. Moncef Slaoui had just been hired to be the J. Robert Oppenheimer of this operation. He's got decades of experience working for one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world, GlaxoSmithKline. And he's helped get more than a dozen vaccines to market. Slaoui is also a millionaire and drives a Ferrari. KADLEC: He drove down from Philadelphia, where he lived, and showed up. And I remember he was in a leather jacket and a shirt, open collar. And it was just like, oh, my God (laughter). Who are - where's your tie? Where'd you - and fortunately, he had a sport coat. But somebody had to lend him his tie. ARONCZYK: There are a few chairs set up in the Rose Garden, and then President Trump emerges from the Oval Office, flanked by Dr. Fauci, Dr. Birx, Defense Secretary Esper. It's kind of a mashup of doctors and generals. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)DONALD TRUMP: Today, I want to update you on the next stage of this momentous medical initiative. It's called Operation Warp Speed. That means big, and it means fast. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: Trump explained some of the details. They've winnowed down the possible vaccines to 14 candidates. And then he introduces Dr. Slaoui. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MONCEF SLAOUI: Thank you, Mr. President. Good afternoon, everyone. ARONCZYK: He's now wearing a silky blue tie, although it's a little crooked. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)SLAOUI: I have very recently seen early data from a clinical trial. These data made me feel even more confident that we will be able to deliver a few hundred million doses of vaccine by the end of 2020, and we will do the best we can - the best we can - to do that. Thank you. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: Even though Dr. Slaoui was an expert, even if he knew things the public couldn't know yet, there had been so many mistakes so far. Eighty-seven thousand Americans were already dead. So when they make this promise, no one believes them. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: The Trump administration's end-of-year goal outpaces what most experts believe is possible. ARTHUR CAPLAN: The shortest time anybody's ever found a vaccine against any disease that I'm familiar with is about seven years. SANJAY GUPTA: This doesn't fit with any timeline that we've ever heard before with regard to vaccines. IRWIN REDLENER: It is impossible to get that done by the end of the year. BORRELL: There was a lot, a lot of pushback. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: Journalist Brendan Borrell again. BORRELL: It was so dizzying at that time. I was just starting to report on COVID. And I had heard everything that Tony Fauci had said and what every expert said, which is, you know, it's going to be another 18 months before we have the vaccine, at a minimum. And then suddenly, this thing called Operation Warp Speed gets announced, and they're saying they could have a vaccine by the end of the year. Nobody really knew what to believe. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: At this point, no one even knows for sure if any of the potential vaccines will work. But still, there's this intense race going on to find out. ARONCZYK: And then talk about flashbacks - the vaccine race hits the summer of 2020. That's after the break. (SOUNDBITE OF ARON WRIGHT AND FLORIAN MOENKS' \"SAY WE GO CIRCULAR\")HOROWITZ-GHAZI: In the summer of 2020, Dr. Bob is still trying to keep himself from getting fired. And he's also trying to help Operation Warp Speed meet its deadline - 300 million doses ready by January 2021. ARONCZYK: There are still a bunch of pharma companies in the race - Moderna, unproven vaccine-makers, Johnson & Johnson, big company, but more talc than facts. AstraZeneca's having some issues. And then there's Pfizer-BioNTech. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: At this point, Pfizer and Moderna are taking the lead, getting volunteers for phase 3, the human trials. ARONCZYK: Now, Pfizer is enormous. And they decide they don't need money from Operation Warp Speed for R&D. But the government has promised to pay them $2 billion for their shots if they work, essentially providing them with a very big incentive. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: And then while they're doing all these trials, something happens that has a surprising effect on all this; George Floyd is murdered in Minneapolis. And the reckoning over race that follows touches everything, including the race to find a vaccine. Dr. Francis Collins is the director of the National Institutes of Health. He's actually Dr. Fauci's boss and one of the key players in making Operation Warp Speed happen. FRANCIS COLLINS: I was deeply moved by what had happened in our country and this just glaring example of how we have not gotten past our long and gruesome history of racism. And it was playing out daily in the presence of COVID-19. ARONCZYK: People of color were disproportionately getting sick and dying from COVID. And at this point in time, Dr. Collins is overseeing the pharma companies that are in phase 3, that are recruiting tens of thousands of people to try out the shots. And he looks at who Moderna has been signing up. COLLINS: They felt this enormous pressure to recruit quickly 'cause it's a public health crisis, and people are dying. And if you're trying to recruit quickly, you recruit the people who are most likely to say yes. And that tends to be white people, especially young, healthy white people. ARONCZYK: Dr. Collins goes to Moderna's executive team, and he's like, what are you going to do about this? And he says that their response was less than satisfying. COLLINS: I mean, it was hand-waving. ARONCZYK: Right. COLLINS: And this is where I got fairly directive. (LAUGHTER)COLLINS: And I made a little speech about, OK, if that's the strategy you're going to pursue, you may have a vaccine that turns out to be safe and effective for white people, but you will have failed, and we will not defend you. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: So at this moment in the pandemic where it feels like every second matters, they pump the brakes. They don't want to go forward with the trials because, Dr. Collins says, if the people testing the vaccine don't represent the American public, the public won't trust the vaccine. Moderna then recruits more people of color. ARONCZYK: So at this moment, you make this request to diversify the trials. What happens? Does it slow things down a little? COLLINS: (Laughter) It, in fact, did have a modest effect of that sort. ARONCZYK: But, Dr. Collins says, just by a week or two. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: Really, though, Pfizer and Moderna were both doing everything possible to be first. They always denied that it was a race against each other. They kept saying, no, it's just a race against the virus. But really, being first would mean bragging rights forever, plus the first chance at those lucrative international deals. ARONCZYK: Then on Sunday, November 8, 2020, Pfizer gets its first peek at whether its vaccine really works. Their executives gather together at their offices in Greenwich, Conn. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: They're there because the data is about to be unblinded. This means that of those thousands of people participating in human trials, some have gotten COVID. But whether that COVID-positive person got the vaccine or the placebo is still a secret. Here's journalist Brendan Borrell again. BORRELL: So the company doesn't know what the results are as they're coming in. ARONCZYK: The company doesn't know. BORRELL: Yeah. I mean, they say it's like going to the dark side of the moon. That's the expression that people use. You have no idea. You've just sunk, you know, half a billion dollars into this thing, and you're not going to find an answer (laughter) out until it's ready. ARONCZYK: So there's this independent group known as the Data and Safety Monitoring Board. They work for the government. And they are the people who know. BORRELL: They have the special goggles that allows them to see the results. . . (LAUGHTER)BORRELL: . . . To see if there's safety problems. And they tell the company they have to halt the trial or tell the company this vaccine is so effective or this treatment is so effective, you know, we're going to take the blind off and we're going to share the results with you. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: Now, the FDA had said, we'll be happy if you can make a vaccine that is 50% effective. The Pfizer execs are sitting, waiting patiently to find out how well their vaccine works. They've finished their boxed lunches. So they're waiting around, and they start making bets. Maybe it's 60% effective, maybe 70%. That'd be pretty good. But they really have no clue. (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"MISSION POSSIBLE: THE RACE FOR A VACCINE\")UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Here we go. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: Yeah. Hello, everybody. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: Hi, Bill (ph). UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #5: There's Bill. ARONCZYK: Pfizer made sure there was a video team there to capture the moment. Everyone is staring at a phone on the conference table. And then there is the world's longest pause. (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"MISSION POSSIBLE: THE RACE FOR A VACCINE\")UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #6: Good news - we made it. (CHEERING)HOROWITZ-GHAZI: And then the question on everyone's mind - how effective is it? (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"MISSION POSSIBLE: THE RACE FOR A VACCINE\")UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #7: The efficacy was more than 90%. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #8: Oh, my God. ARONCZYK: They break out the Champagne. (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"MISSION POSSIBLE: THE RACE FOR A VACCINE\")UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #8: I love you. KADLEC: Yeah, it was, like, stunning, right? ARONCZYK: Dr. Bob remembers when he heard the results. KADLEC: It was, like, unbelievable. It was, like, you know, wait; there's got to be a mistake or something. And then knowing, you know, within weeks later, Moderna's to match that. It was just - it was like, oh, my God. It was like almost you couldn't even dream it possible. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: It had been just seven months since he wrote the Manhattan Project on his office whiteboard. KADLEC: I got to tell you, though, it was like, yay; now let's focus on moving - you know, what's next? ARONCZYK: Technically, Operation Warp Speed did not meet its stated goal. The promise was 300 million doses by January 2021, and instead, by that date they'd distributed 50 million. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: But in a lot of ways, Operation Warp Speed had been monumental. The program that began in Dr. Bob's office managed to solve a fundamental failure in the vaccine market. They'd collapsed the approval process. And they'd helped develop several shockingly effective vaccines. And they did it three years faster than ever before. (SOUNDBITE OF BLUE DOT SESSIONS' \"TARTE TATIN\")ARONCZYK: The Biden administration didn't end up keeping Dr. Bob around. But they did keep Operation Warp Speed. They gave it a new name, one that only a Democrat could love - the Countermeasures Acceleration Group. And we should note Dr. Moncef Slaoui was also dismissed by the Biden administration, and he later faced a sexual harassment charge at his old job. He apologized and resigned. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: As for the rest of us, we did get to enjoy Dr. Bob's yay moment for a little bit. But now the what's next is kind of looming over everything. How many boosters will we need? Will we share the vaccines with the countries that need it most? Journalist Brendan Borrell says there are still lots of questions around profit and ownership and patents swirling around. ARONCZYK: Did we, with Operation Warp Speed, just rush a bunch of vaccines that would've otherwise been made by, like, say, Pfizer, doing it on taxpayer money and then sending all of that taxpayer money to Big Pharma? BORRELL: You know, I think Big Pharma certainly got a good deal out of all of this. The question of how these profits should be distributed and who owes who for what patent - certainly all of this was built on some very basic research, some of it coming out of the National Institutes of Health, some of it coming out of academic institutions. And I think some of that's going to get sorted out in the courts. I mean, hopefully some of this money will go back to basic research that will prepare us for the next pandemic. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: The next pandemic - too soon, Brendan. Too soon. (SOUNDBITE OF JEREMY NOEL WILLIAM ABBOTT'S \"HIP HOP KID POP\")ARONCZYK: There is so much more to this story, and you can read about it in the book that this episode is based on. It's called \"The First Shots,\" written by Brendan Borrell, and it is a great read.

And we'd also love to hear what this has meant for your business that you cannot find workers. And then on the other hand, are you a worker who has turned down a job or quit? Tell us why. Was the pay too low? Is it safety, child care? Is it something we haven't thought of yet? And then thirdly here, are you looking for work and cannot find it? Do you want to call b. s. on the whole labor shortage? Have you applied for jobs that are maybe even at companies complaining about the shortage? If your answer is yes to any of these, we would love to hear from you. We'd love to have you record a brief voice memo on your cellphone - keep it to a minute or less, please - with just the main details, as well as your name and your location. And then email that to planetmoney@npr. org. That's planetmoney@npr. org. You can write to us by email as well, but a voice memo is way better for us. Thank you, and on to the show. SYLVIE DOUGLIS, BYLINE: This is PLANET MONEY from NPR. (SOUNDBITE OF COIN SPINNING) AMANDA ARONCZYK, HOST:   It's March 2020. Dr. Robert Kadlec, known by his colleagues as Dr. Bob, finds himself in the middle of the COVID crisis. And that's because last year, Dr. Bob, a former Air Force physician and bioweapons expert under George W. Bush, he is now the assistant secretary for preparedness and response at the Department of Health and Human Services, meaning that now that there is a pandemic, it's on Dr. Bob to deal with it. Remember what it was like a year and a half ago? There were not enough gloves, not enough masks, not enough PPE. There were no proven medicines for COVID, no vaccines. So Dr. Bob's portfolio of responsibilities was pretty large. So briefly, it's being prepared. . . ROBERT KADLEC: Being prepared. ARONCZYK: . . . The stockpile. . . KADLEC: The stockpile. ARONCZYK: . . . All the vaccines. KADLEC: And all the vaccines. ARONCZYK: So you're kind of a pandemic guy. KADLEC: Yeah, it's - that's a good way of putting it. ARONCZYK: Dr. Bob is the kind of person who turns to history for ideas. So he does what Dr. Bob does, and he starts to dig into the archives. There, he finds a technical manual from 1962 where researchers had tested what materials could be turned into an impromptu mask. KADLEC: There were things like using toilet paper folded over, using T-shirts and a variety of other products. ARONCZYK: And in this manual, he finds some pretty good evidence that, yes, cloth masks are effective. Dr. Bob's like, great. Cloth masks - let's do this. He calls up Hanes, and he convinces them to pivot from making underwear to making masks. They make an agreement, and he launches America Strong - Keep Healthy and Live On - which is a cloth mask initiative. KADLEC: Now, the color was somewhat controversial initially. ARONCZYK: The color was controversial. What color were they? KADLEC: Well, they were white because, you know, what you didn't want to have something is - somebody would have this mask and would never wash it. And so the idea that it was white would show dirt. ARONCZYK: Right. KADLEC: And then people would be self-conscious, and they would wash their mask. ARONCZYK: Function over fashion - that is so Dr. Bob. So he takes a slice out of his tiny budget to order 650 million white cotton masks from Hanes. KADLEC: They cost about 71 cents per mask. Shipping was about 62 cents with the Postal Service so that we could conceivably mail them to every residence in the United States. ARONCZYK: But you might've noticed you never got a pack of these America Strong masks in the mail. That's because they weren't sent. And even though the CDC liked the plan - so did Dr. Fauci, so did FEMA. . . KADLEC: When it came time to brief it to the audience at the White House task force, I didn't get even to the first slide. It was interrupted and stopped. ARONCZYK: What went wrong? KADLEC: Well, I'd like to know, too. ARONCZYK: Dr. Bob asks around, but he never gets a formal answer. Instead, he just hears trivial, gossipy comments about his mask. KADLEC: No one would wear them. No one wanted to use the Postal Service. Why were they white? You know, they look like underwear. ARONCZYK: That one's a little true. KADLEC: We never had the full debate, and it was pulled off the agenda and never to be surfaced again. ARONCZYK: There have been some studies since that suggest that his idea could have saved tens of thousands of lives. KADLEC: Yeah, that's the one thing that keeps me awake at night even today. With that not going forward, it was time to come up with another idea. ARONCZYK: Another idea, because if Dr. Bob can't slow the spread with masks, then he really has only one other option. He better get some vaccines made, and he better do it fast. (SOUNDBITE OF ADRIAN QUESADA, ERIC BURTON AND SKINNY WILLIAMS SONG, \"THE SOUL OF SHAOLIN\") ARONCZYK: Hello, and welcome to PLANET MONEY. I'm Amanda Aronczyk. ALEXI HOROWITZ-GHAZI, HOST:   And I'm Alexi Horowitz-Ghazi. Now that we have a few different COVID-19 vaccines, it might seem inevitable that it would happen this way. But a year and a half ago, when Dr. Bob first embarked on his mission, it felt impossible. ARONCZYK: Today on the show, Dr. Bob's next idea - Operation Warp Speed. This is the story behind the story of how the vaccines were made in record time. And one little, quick warning - this show is going to be a weird, trippy flashback. Like, was this last year? Was this a thousand years ago? There is no way to know for sure. (SOUNDBITE OF ADRIAN QUESADA, ERIC BURTON AND SKINNY WILLIAMS SONG, \"THE SOUL OF SHAOLIN\") ARONCZYK: It's April 2020, just a couple of days after Dr. Bob Kadlec's mask idea gets shot down, and he is feeling desperate. He is the government's pandemic guy, appointed by President Trump, responsible for making sure we have the medicines and vaccines we need. But he has got nothing. The medicine cabinet is bare. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: So he texts some of his closest colleagues and he says, can you please come meet with me? I've got this idea. Plus, I can offer you an incentive. KADLEC: Well, I think there were about three or four pizzas. They were from We, The Pizza on Capitol Hill. They deliver. They take American Express (laughter). ARONCZYK: Five of Dr. Bob's buddies bite. They show up to his windowless office on the sixth floor of the Hubert H. Humphrey Building for some pizza and brainstorming. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: This group knows that in the past, pharmaceutical companies haven't wanted to make vaccines for emerging diseases, new outbreaks because who knows how many people will need it? What if the outbreak just goes away? That's what happened with SARS and MERS and Zika. KADLEC: There was no one on the commercial side that was willing to invest the money for something that may or may not occur ever again. ARONCZYK: For the pharma companies, it's too unpredictable a market. They can't guarantee that they'll make a profit. So the big companies don't want to invest in something so risky, and the small companies don't necessarily have the money or experience to navigate all the hoops. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: So what about the government? KADLEC: The government can't manufacture vaccines. Now, we have tried historically, and in doing so, we have failed magnificently. ARONCZYK: In the past, the government has tried to be a maker of vaccines, to have labs and their own factories. But Dr. Bob says it was just too hard and too expensive for them to do well. KADLEC: They went through a variety of different analyses - some economic, some scientific and technical - and in the end realized that the wherewithal, the experience and expertise to make these things do not reside in the government. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: He says Big Pharma won't go alone and the government can't go alone. Then, in walks COVID-19, and now Dr. Bob has to find a way to get everyone to work together so something can get made, like, right, right now. ARONCZYK: Now again, Dr. Bob has turned to history to find a solution. He's standing in front of his buddies, and he takes a black marker, and he writes up on the whiteboard, Manhattan Project. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) HARRY TRUMAN: We have spent more than $2 billion on the greatest scientific gamble in history. ARONCZYK: This is President Harry Truman talking about the Manhattan Project, which was a secret program launched during the second world war to create an atomic bomb. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMAN: Both science and industry work together under the direction of the United States Army, which achieved a unique success in an amazingly short time. KADLEC: Obviously, we weren't making a bomb. We were trying to develop vaccines and therapeutics. But it was this idea that it would be a partnership with the U. S. government and the private sector to accelerate the speed of science and have a product at the end of that - in this case, a vaccine. ARONCZYK: So they need to accelerate the speed of science. But how? Dr. Bob and his colleagues discuss what the process usually takes. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: First, there's academic research, where they try to figure out exactly what it is they're making. ARONCZYK: Then there are preclinical trials, where they test it on mice and monkeys. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: That's followed by phase 1 trials, basically asking, is this thing safe? ARONCZYK: And then phase 2 trials, where they take a few more people and they see, OK, what's the right dosage? HOROWITZ-GHAZI: Finally, phase 3 trials. That's where they're going to get a ton of people and make sure this thing really works. ARONCZYK: And if it does, now they get it all approved by the FDA. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: Less than 10% of new drugs get that approval because at any point a vaccine or drug could fail. There's even a part of this whole journey that's known affectionately as the Valley of Death. ARONCZYK: The way things have been done in the past will not work for a respiratory virus that is quickly spreading around the world. Up until now, the fastest timeline for a new vaccine was four years. Thankfully, Dr. Bob knows someone at the FDA, Dr. Peter Marks. They patch him into the pizza party. KADLEC: Peter Marks, you know, came on the line, and we pitched him about this idea of accelerating the FDA approval cycle. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: Together, they come up with a bold solution. What if they were to run all the parts of the FDA process - the animal trials, the human trials, the data analysis - all roughly at the same time? KADLEC: It's basically taking a string, as linear as it is when you hold it end to end, and then folding it on itself to take the processes that are typically done sequentially and doing them in parallel. ARONCZYK: Dr. Bob loves this idea. And what if we could also manufacture the vaccine candidates while we're testing them? Now, in normal times, pharmaceutical companies wait until after the FDA gives approval to start manufacturing. Setting up a vaccine factory takes months or even years and millions of dollars. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: So Drs. Bob, Peter and company come up with another idea. What if the government pays companies to start manufacturing vaccines before they are approved? KADLEC: Yeah, your product may not get through the wickets, may not get through FDA approval, but we're going to pay you to develop this product, to manufacture it at scale. So that was going to be a role of the U. S. government was to assume the risk of manufacturing at risk. ARONCZYK: If a company manufactures a vaccine and it's found to not be safe or it doesn't work, they will dump it, but they won't have to eat the cost of making it. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: So Peter has ideas about how to make the FDA process move faster without compromising safety. And Dr. Bob has ideas about how to get the government and private companies to work together. They start to hatch a clear plan. KADLEC: It was kind of like the Reese's Peanut Butter Cup experience. I had the chocolate, he had the peanut butter, and together we were in business. ARONCZYK: They write up a mission statement, come up with a name. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: Project Peanut Butter Cup? ARONCZYK: No. They call it Project Warp Speed because \"Star Trek. \" Dr. Peter's a huge Trekkie. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: Aside from the Manhattan Project being their inspiration, they also copy the leadership structure. You might have heard of J. Robert Oppenheimer. He's often remembered as the head of the Manhattan Project. But there were actually two leads. Oppenheimer was the scientific lead, and Lieutenant General Leslie Groves was the operational lead. Dr. Bob wanted to do the same thing. ARONCZYK: So it would be a collaboration between the health department and the military. So they don't want to call it Project Warp Speed. The military doesn't do projects anymore. Projects are for the dorks over at NASA. Today's military, they do operations. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: Now all they have to do is get their idea approved by the White House. But there are not actually a lot of fans at the White House of Dr. Bob and his team - you know, the folks who ordered hundreds of millions of tighty-whities for your face. BRENDAN BORRELL: They were on the outs at that point. ARONCZYK: This is Brendan Borrell. He's a journalist, and he's the one who introduced me to Dr. Bob Kadlec. Brendan just published a book called \"The First Shots,\" and this episode is based on his reporting. BORRELL: Kadlec's boss was on the verge of getting fired, and so was Kadlec. And this is like a team of basically outcasts from the Trump administration, right? HOROWITZ-GHAZI: There's fighting going on between the White House and the health department over ventilators and PPE and testing. But this ragtag team of outcasts, they still need President Trump. BORRELL: For the program to work, because it is taking two branches of government, it needed the approval of the White House, and that came in the form of Jared Kushner, who, you know, is the president's son-in-law and, you know, known as the secretary of everything and had been kind of meddling in the pandemic response. And Kushner knew that it was important. And so he kind of provided the cover for it and the protection. So he took it to Trump, got Trump to say, yeah, this is a good idea. And at that point on, they were left to do their own thing. ARONCZYK: May 15, 2020, is the official launch of Operation Warp Speed. Dr. Bob was there. KADLEC: There was a Rose Garden ceremony at the White House, and I was invited to it, interesting enough. And so I got a front-row seat. And all I know - it was sweltering heat, and I'm just - and, of course, you had to get there early. And I'm just sitting in this chair, like, in a puddle of sweat. And I just remember meeting Dr. Slaoui for the first time that day. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: Dr. Moncef Slaoui had just been hired to be the J. Robert Oppenheimer of this operation. He's got decades of experience working for one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world, GlaxoSmithKline. And he's helped get more than a dozen vaccines to market. Slaoui is also a millionaire and drives a Ferrari. KADLEC: He drove down from Philadelphia, where he lived, and showed up. And I remember he was in a leather jacket and a shirt, open collar. And it was just like, oh, my God (laughter). Who are - where's your tie? Where'd you - and fortunately, he had a sport coat. But somebody had to lend him his tie. ARONCZYK: There are a few chairs set up in the Rose Garden, and then President Trump emerges from the Oval Office, flanked by Dr. Fauci, Dr. Birx, Defense Secretary Esper. It's kind of a mashup of doctors and generals. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DONALD TRUMP: Today, I want to update you on the next stage of this momentous medical initiative. It's called Operation Warp Speed. That means big, and it means fast. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: Trump explained some of the details. They've winnowed down the possible vaccines to 14 candidates. And then he introduces Dr. Slaoui. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) MONCEF SLAOUI: Thank you, Mr. President. Good afternoon, everyone. ARONCZYK: He's now wearing a silky blue tie, although it's a little crooked. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) SLAOUI: I have very recently seen early data from a clinical trial. These data made me feel even more confident that we will be able to deliver a few hundred million doses of vaccine by the end of 2020, and we will do the best we can - the best we can - to do that. Thank you. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: Even though Dr. Slaoui was an expert, even if he knew things the public couldn't know yet, there had been so many mistakes so far. Eighty-seven thousand Americans were already dead. So when they make this promise, no one believes them. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE) UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: The Trump administration's end-of-year goal outpaces what most experts believe is possible. ARTHUR CAPLAN: The shortest time anybody's ever found a vaccine against any disease that I'm familiar with is about seven years. SANJAY GUPTA: This doesn't fit with any timeline that we've ever heard before with regard to vaccines. IRWIN REDLENER: It is impossible to get that done by the end of the year. BORRELL: There was a lot, a lot of pushback. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: Journalist Brendan Borrell again. BORRELL: It was so dizzying at that time. I was just starting to report on COVID. And I had heard everything that Tony Fauci had said and what every expert said, which is, you know, it's going to be another 18 months before we have the vaccine, at a minimum. And then suddenly, this thing called Operation Warp Speed gets announced, and they're saying they could have a vaccine by the end of the year. Nobody really knew what to believe. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: At this point, no one even knows for sure if any of the potential vaccines will work. But still, there's this intense race going on to find out. ARONCZYK: And then talk about flashbacks - the vaccine race hits the summer of 2020. That's after the break. (SOUNDBITE OF ARON WRIGHT AND FLORIAN MOENKS' \"SAY WE GO CIRCULAR\") HOROWITZ-GHAZI: In the summer of 2020, Dr. Bob is still trying to keep himself from getting fired. And he's also trying to help Operation Warp Speed meet its deadline - 300 million doses ready by January 2021. ARONCZYK: There are still a bunch of pharma companies in the race - Moderna, unproven vaccine-makers, Johnson & Johnson, big company, but more talc than facts. AstraZeneca's having some issues. And then there's Pfizer-BioNTech. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: At this point, Pfizer and Moderna are taking the lead, getting volunteers for phase 3, the human trials. ARONCZYK: Now, Pfizer is enormous. And they decide they don't need money from Operation Warp Speed for R&D. But the government has promised to pay them $2 billion for their shots if they work, essentially providing them with a very big incentive. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: And then while they're doing all these trials, something happens that has a surprising effect on all this; George Floyd is murdered in Minneapolis. And the reckoning over race that follows touches everything, including the race to find a vaccine. Dr. Francis Collins is the director of the National Institutes of Health. He's actually Dr. Fauci's boss and one of the key players in making Operation Warp Speed happen. FRANCIS COLLINS: I was deeply moved by what had happened in our country and this just glaring example of how we have not gotten past our long and gruesome history of racism. And it was playing out daily in the presence of COVID-19. ARONCZYK: People of color were disproportionately getting sick and dying from COVID. And at this point in time, Dr. Collins is overseeing the pharma companies that are in phase 3, that are recruiting tens of thousands of people to try out the shots. And he looks at who Moderna has been signing up. COLLINS: They felt this enormous pressure to recruit quickly 'cause it's a public health crisis, and people are dying. And if you're trying to recruit quickly, you recruit the people who are most likely to say yes. And that tends to be white people, especially young, healthy white people. ARONCZYK: Dr. Collins goes to Moderna's executive team, and he's like, what are you going to do about this? And he says that their response was less than satisfying. COLLINS: I mean, it was hand-waving. ARONCZYK: Right. COLLINS: And this is where I got fairly directive. (LAUGHTER) COLLINS: And I made a little speech about, OK, if that's the strategy you're going to pursue, you may have a vaccine that turns out to be safe and effective for white people, but you will have failed, and we will not defend you. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: So at this moment in the pandemic where it feels like every second matters, they pump the brakes. They don't want to go forward with the trials because, Dr. Collins says, if the people testing the vaccine don't represent the American public, the public won't trust the vaccine. Moderna then recruits more people of color. ARONCZYK: So at this moment, you make this request to diversify the trials. What happens? Does it slow things down a little? COLLINS: (Laughter) It, in fact, did have a modest effect of that sort. ARONCZYK: But, Dr. Collins says, just by a week or two. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: Really, though, Pfizer and Moderna were both doing everything possible to be first. They always denied that it was a race against each other. They kept saying, no, it's just a race against the virus. But really, being first would mean bragging rights forever, plus the first chance at those lucrative international deals. ARONCZYK: Then on Sunday, November 8, 2020, Pfizer gets its first peek at whether its vaccine really works. Their executives gather together at their offices in Greenwich, Conn. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: They're there because the data is about to be unblinded. This means that of those thousands of people participating in human trials, some have gotten COVID. But whether that COVID-positive person got the vaccine or the placebo is still a secret. Here's journalist Brendan Borrell again. BORRELL: So the company doesn't know what the results are as they're coming in. ARONCZYK: The company doesn't know. BORRELL: Yeah. I mean, they say it's like going to the dark side of the moon. That's the expression that people use. You have no idea. You've just sunk, you know, half a billion dollars into this thing, and you're not going to find an answer (laughter) out until it's ready. ARONCZYK: So there's this independent group known as the Data and Safety Monitoring Board. They work for the government. And they are the people who know. BORRELL: They have the special goggles that allows them to see the results. . . (LAUGHTER) BORRELL: . . . To see if there's safety problems. And they tell the company they have to halt the trial or tell the company this vaccine is so effective or this treatment is so effective, you know, we're going to take the blind off and we're going to share the results with you. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: Now, the FDA had said, we'll be happy if you can make a vaccine that is 50% effective. The Pfizer execs are sitting, waiting patiently to find out how well their vaccine works. They've finished their boxed lunches. So they're waiting around, and they start making bets. Maybe it's 60% effective, maybe 70%. That'd be pretty good. But they really have no clue. (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"MISSION POSSIBLE: THE RACE FOR A VACCINE\") UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Here we go. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: Yeah. Hello, everybody. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: Hi, Bill (ph). UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #5: There's Bill. ARONCZYK: Pfizer made sure there was a video team there to capture the moment. Everyone is staring at a phone on the conference table. And then there is the world's longest pause. (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"MISSION POSSIBLE: THE RACE FOR A VACCINE\") UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #6: Good news - we made it. (CHEERING) HOROWITZ-GHAZI: And then the question on everyone's mind - how effective is it? (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"MISSION POSSIBLE: THE RACE FOR A VACCINE\") UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #7: The efficacy was more than 90%. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #8: Oh, my God. ARONCZYK: They break out the Champagne. (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"MISSION POSSIBLE: THE RACE FOR A VACCINE\") UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #8: I love you. KADLEC: Yeah, it was, like, stunning, right? ARONCZYK: Dr. Bob remembers when he heard the results. KADLEC: It was, like, unbelievable. It was, like, you know, wait; there's got to be a mistake or something. And then knowing, you know, within weeks later, Moderna's to match that. It was just - it was like, oh, my God. It was like almost you couldn't even dream it possible. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: It had been just seven months since he wrote the Manhattan Project on his office whiteboard. KADLEC: I got to tell you, though, it was like, yay; now let's focus on moving - you know, what's next? ARONCZYK: Technically, Operation Warp Speed did not meet its stated goal. The promise was 300 million doses by January 2021, and instead, by that date they'd distributed 50 million. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: But in a lot of ways, Operation Warp Speed had been monumental. The program that began in Dr. Bob's office managed to solve a fundamental failure in the vaccine market. They'd collapsed the approval process. And they'd helped develop several shockingly effective vaccines. And they did it three years faster than ever before. (SOUNDBITE OF BLUE DOT SESSIONS' \"TARTE TATIN\") ARONCZYK: The Biden administration didn't end up keeping Dr. Bob around. But they did keep Operation Warp Speed. They gave it a new name, one that only a Democrat could love - the Countermeasures Acceleration Group. And we should note Dr. Moncef Slaoui was also dismissed by the Biden administration, and he later faced a sexual harassment charge at his old job. He apologized and resigned. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: As for the rest of us, we did get to enjoy Dr. Bob's yay moment for a little bit. But now the what's next is kind of looming over everything. How many boosters will we need? Will we share the vaccines with the countries that need it most? Journalist Brendan Borrell says there are still lots of questions around profit and ownership and patents swirling around. ARONCZYK: Did we, with Operation Warp Speed, just rush a bunch of vaccines that would've otherwise been made by, like, say, Pfizer, doing it on taxpayer money and then sending all of that taxpayer money to Big Pharma? BORRELL: You know, I think Big Pharma certainly got a good deal out of all of this. The question of how these profits should be distributed and who owes who for what patent - certainly all of this was built on some very basic research, some of it coming out of the National Institutes of Health, some of it coming out of academic institutions. And I think some of that's going to get sorted out in the courts. I mean, hopefully some of this money will go back to basic research that will prepare us for the next pandemic. HOROWITZ-GHAZI: The next pandemic - too soon, Brendan. Too soon. (SOUNDBITE OF JEREMY NOEL WILLIAM ABBOTT'S \"HIP HOP KID POP\") ARONCZYK: There is so much more to this story, and you can read about it in the book that this episode is based on. It's called \"The First Shots,\" written by Brendan Borrell, and it is a great read.

It's also home to the biggest storm. The Great Red Spot has been visible for centuries, but we still don't know much about it. But because of a spacecraft launched a decade ago, we are now finally getting a look inside Jupiter's storm. From member station WMFE in Orlando, Brendan Byrne reports. BRENDAN BYRNE, BYLINE: The Great Red Spot is like a storm here on Earth but of cosmic proportions. PAUL BYRNE: It's basically clouds. B BYRNE: Paul Byrne is a planetary scientist at Washington University in St. Louis. P BYRNE: It's not all that dissimilar to the kinds of things we know as cyclones or hurricanes or typhoons on Earth. B BYRNE: The Great Red Spot is the largest storm in our Solar System and has been continually observed for around 200 years, but it's been around for much longer. From the top down, Scott Bolton says, scientists have been able to track changes in the spot. It's getting more circular and tinier. SCOTT BOLTON: We believe this thing is really old. How it lasts that long is a mystery. B BYRNE: Bolton is the principal investigator of the Juno mission. That spacecraft launched from Florida back in 2011 and arrived at Jupiter in 2016, hoping to answer that question. In 2019, the spacecraft changed course slightly and passed over the Great Red Spot twice. Bolton and his team used microwave sensors to slice into the depths of the storm, getting the first 3D model of the Great Red Spot. BOLTON: It's a pancake because it's so wide at the top, but it's - the depth of it, that pancake is much thicker than what we would have anticipated. B BYRNE: The storm is so massive, the spacecraft could actually feel the changes in gravity as it passed over the spot, almost like bumps in the road. (SOUNDBITE OF RADIO WAVES)B BYRNE: The radio waves get squeezed and stretched by the gravitational bumps of the storm. Scientists analyzed these waves and found that the Great Red Spot extended some 300 miles into Jupiter's atmosphere. For comparison, the International Space Station is about 150 miles above our heads. Even though the storm is wide and deep, scientists have found that the spot has been shrinking. So can the Juno mission shed any light as to why or when it might disappear? Bolton says it's too soon to tell what the Great Spot's ultimate fate may be. These early data may give them some clues as to what's driving some of the changes. BOLTON: We're starting to see that there are elements of the dynamics that are telling us that. B BYRNE: While it's still too soon to say when the Spot will disappear, Bolton says the findings revealed the Great Red Spot is actually trapped between powerful conveyor belts of wind on the planet that are stabilizing the storm, meaning it could be around much longer for us to see from here on Earth.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"EVERY BREATH YOU TAKE\")THE POLICE: (Singing) Every breath you take and every move you make. MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:  The Police, of course - \"Every Breath You Take\" was a huge sensation when it came out in 1983. And today, it plays on - the soundtrack to parties and weddings, trips to the grocery store. STEPHEN THOMPSON, BYLINE: I'm not surprised at all that people continue to gravitate to it in part because it sounds so distinct. KELLY: That is NPR Music's Stephen Thompson. THOMPSON: It's actually kind of a monochromatic arrangement. It has that one really memorable kind of snaky guitar line to it. But otherwise, that song kind of sits flat. And weirdly, I think over the decades, that has kind of been flipped from what might be seen as a weakness to a strength. CHANG: Well, now there's some new science that might explain the song's staying power. In a study published this week by the Royal Society, researchers in Denmark analyzed streaming data for nearly 4 million songs on Spotify to see if there was a pattern to the types of music we listen to over a 24-hour period. OLE HEGGLI: And we found that we could categorize it into five distinct time blocks throughout the day. KELLY: Ole Heggli of Aarhus University says those five time blocks have different musical qualities. In the morning block, slow but energetic songs dominate. Heggli suggested \"Supreme\" by Robbie Williams. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"SUPREME\")ROBBIE WILLIAMS: (Singing) When there's no love in town, this new century keeps bringing you down. CHANG: Now, louder, faster songs rule in the afternoon, like \"Only Girl (In The World)\" by Rihanna. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"ONLY GIRL (IN THE WORLD)\")RIHANNA: (Singing) Want you to make me feel like I'm the only girl in the world. KELLY: Danceable music in the evening - you get the point. And it's not that surprising. Scientists say it shows how our music preferences are shaped by our daily rhythms. CHANG: But here's the catch - the song whose musical qualities would allow it to drift through all five time blocks? Well, you guessed it. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"EVERY BREATH YOU TAKE\")THE POLICE: (Singing) I'll be watching you, every breath you take, every move you make. HEGGLI: Mainly because it is a very in-the-middle type of song - it's a medium tempo. It's a bit groovy, but not too much groovy. It doesn't have any, you know, like, loud surprises. And it's all over just a very pleasant, perhaps even a bit bland song. KELLY: So is there anything artists trying to score a hit can learn from The Police? Heggli thinks yes. HEGGLI: You should really aim for something that's, you know, more or less in the middle of the pack - something that's not too high in tempo but also not too low, and something that's danceable but maybe not too danceable, either. CHANG: NPR's Stephen Thompson is not so sure. THOMPSON: I don't think it's a bad thing if there's a song that's best for 6 a. m.

Hey, Anya. ANYA KAMENETZ, BYLINE: Hey, Rachel. MARTIN: Before we get into this, can we just start by understanding what the official guidance on masking for kids is right now? KAMENETZ: The CDC says everyone in a K-12 school should stay masked, period. And Rochelle Walensky recently said, you know, at least through the winter months - although we know there are many states and districts where masks in school are optional and even some where they are banned. MARTIN: Right. KAMENETZ: But now what's changed, I think, is that there are more and more kind of mainstream medical experts saying, we need to set a timeline for lifting these remaining mask mandates safely. So for example, when the vaccine for children has been around for, let's say, eight weeks or when 80% of the students are vaccinated, it should be time to take these masks off. MARTIN: Right. So tell us more about the medical professionals you talked to. KAMENETZ: So Dr. Jeanne Noble at UC San Francisco is, fair to say, pretty fed up with masking. She's been really concerned about students' mental health in California and these continued restrictions in a part of the country with very few infections right now and very high rates of vaccination. JEANNE NOBLE: We're soon going to be entering the third year of this pandemic, and kids have sacrificed a lot. And I think families need to know, when is it that our kids' lives are going to go fully back to normal? KAMENETZ: So Noble is one of the authors of a petition signed by 150 Bay Area health professionals asking the state of California to state clearly, when can students take off these masks? If it were up to her, it would be happening by the end of next month, after these Pfizer vaccines for children have been around for a while. MARTIN: Are there any places, Anya, that are actually moving in that direction? KAMENETZ: Yeah, across the country. In the state of Massachusetts, the department of education has said, as soon as a school demonstrates a vaccination rate of 80% or more - that's including both staff and students in the building - everyone who is vaccinated can take their masks off. And our member station colleague Carrie Jung at WBUR visited a school in Massachusetts that has done just that. CARRIE JUNG, BYLINE: The town of Hopkinton is usually known for its role as the starting line of the Boston Marathon. But it's in the spotlight again as the first district in Massachusetts that's attempting to phase out mask mandates for vaccinated students and staff. To test out the idea, the school committee recently approved a three-week trial run. I stopped by in the middle of Week 2, just as school was letting out. The scene looked pretty normal as the hallway flooded with students. Many greeted their friends after a day apart. But only about half of the kids were wearing masks. OWEN SCHNUR: Today I am unmasked. EVANYA MATHUR: I am a masked sophomore at the high school. JUNG: Senior Owen Schnur and sophomore Evanya Mathur say their decisions are personal. Mathur wants to wear a mask until her younger sibling gets vaccinated. But Schnur says he feels safe without one because about 98% of his classmates are vaccinated. So far, both say they've been surprised at how much they've enjoyed this trial period. MATHUR: It's been really important to me to see my teachers' faces and see their face light up when someone gets a question right. JUNG: But not everyone is excited about the idea, like Madison Loos, who's a senior. MADISON LOOS: I was absolutely against it. I still am not sure I support it. I just don't - I haven't really established an opinion yet. But so far, I still wish we were all masked. JUNG: Still, Loos says despite her reservations, she has noticed a lot of unexpected emotional benefits. LOOS: You're communicating more than, like, before when it was just, like, looking at someone's eyes to read their cues (laughter). MENA YOUSSIF: Like, my English teacher always say to me, like, it's hard to recognize what we are saying with masks. You cannot see our lips. JUNG: For students like Mena Youssif, who moved here from Egypt two years ago, the policy has also made it easier to understand and speak English. YOUSSIF: So like, when we take the mask off, it makes it much easier. JUNG: All of the students I spoke to said this trial run has been an unexpected morale boost, even for those who have to stay masked because they aren't vaccinated yet, like Andrew Gaughan. ANDREW GAUGHAN: I personally think it's great. I really enjoy seeing people's faces. I mean, it just makes for a better experience in school. JUNG: Hearing such positive reports on the ground from students is a relief for district leaders like school committee chair Nancy Cavanaugh. She says making the decision wasn't easy because of the intense debate in the community. NANCY CAVANAUGH: We got a lot of people that couldn't imagine that we would even entertain such a decision. And then we got the other side of that of people who are really angry that we won't entertain unmasking our vaccinated students. JUNG: In the end, the school committee voted to try it with a few safeguards, like starting with a trial period, requiring vaccination proof and parent permission forms. CAVANAUGH: It's baby steps. We have been really, I think, very cautious. JUNG: So far, one student has tested positive for COVID-19, but health officials believe transmission of that case happened outside of the high school. The trial period wraps up next week. After that, the school committee will analyze what happened and decide if they want to make the policy permanent. In the meantime, students like Jessica Ianelli say she's going to enjoy this mask-free time with her friends while it lasts. JESSICA IANELLI: I, like, forgot what the bottom half of their face looks like, which sounds so weird to say. But it's nice to see that come back to normal. JUNG: For NPR News, I'm Carrie Jung in Hopkinton, Mass. MARTIN: So interesting to hear all those kids reflecting on the pros and cons of wearing their masks. I mean, it sounds like the experiment, though, in this one district in Massachusetts is sort of working. Anya, are you seeing other districts likely to follow suit? KAMENETZ: You know, I - and I agree with you. I think - you know, we didn't talk so much about the downsides of masking. But you can definitely hear in these students' voices, you know, the impact that it's had even on their moods. MARTIN: Right. KAMENETZ: I do see other districts following suit. There's been so many battle lines drawn over masks, so it's remarkable to see communities like this one that have been so COVID cautious start taking the masks off. You know, but this is a special place. This is a school where 98% of the people are vaccinated. And there are many communities around the country where people are rejecting both masks and, in many cases, vaccines. So in those places, I think it's going to be a lot harder to line up the science with rules that are going to make everybody happy. But the public health experts - and I should underline this is still a really small group that are calling on states and the CDC to update their guidance - told me that they're speaking, you know, not only to the impatience that a lot of families may have to get back to normal, but to a real risk as well from a public health perspective. And that's if we keep extending restrictions and refuse to even talk about when they're going to be eased, that that could erode public trust in health authorities. And you know, if there's a new surge, a new variant, even a new virus that people might refuse to put the masks back on when they really need to. MARTIN: All right. NPR education correspondent Anya Kamenetz. Anya, thank you so much for bringing us this story. We appreciate it. KAMENETZ: Oh, thanks, Rachel.

N. climate summit in Glasgow, but major energy companies are a big presence at COP26. NPR's Frank Langfitt reports. FRANK LANGFITT, BYLINE: The Russian Federation hosted two energy executives this week at its pavilion here at the summit. Nigel Dunn is a senior vice president at BP. He touted his company's shift away from oil and towards wind, solar and hydrogen and portrayed BP as part of the solution to the climate crisis. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)NIGEL DUNN: We absolutely need green companies, companies that are developing renewables, but we also need greening companies. And I would like to think BP is one of those greening companies that is committed to the energy transition because time is running out, and we need to hit this transition at pace. LANGFITT: The other speaker was Sergey Vakulenko, an executive with Gazprom Neft, the Russian oil and gas company. He warned just how much that energy shift is going to cost consumers. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)SERGEY VAKULENKO: Politicians are trying to tell, to their electorates, that energy transition would be painless and costless. And effectively, it shifts the blame to business. LANGFITT: Vakulenko cited a report by the International Energy Agency. It said the transition would cost trillions of dollars. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)VAKULENKO: People would have to change their habits when it comes to temperature in their homes, that the temperature should be, well, somewhat uncomfortable. The people might have to change their diets and eat less beef, change their vacation habits and fly less. LANGFITT: A group of protesters arrives at the Russian pavilion. It's about two stories high amid this giant convention floor. It's kind of laid out like a trade show. The moderator, who works for the Russian Energy Agency, decides to wrap up the conversation early. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: I got a message from the organizers. They're asking me to speed up the meeting. LANGFITT: So there's no Q&A. UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTERS: (Chanting) No more lies. Keep it in the ground. No more lies. Keep it in the ground. LANGFITT: Nigel Dunn of BP, he takes off. I catch up with him about 40 yards away. Sir, when did BP start working on this energy transition? DUNN: So you have to go through my press office for any comment. LANGFITT: You just spoke for an hour and a half in there, and you're not taking any questions at all. . . DUNN: No. LANGFITT: . . . On one of the biggest issues facing the planet? DUNN: Sorry. Sorry. You have to go through my press office. LANGFITT: A report by several watchdog groups says that more than 500 people here at the summit were for countries or organizations which lobby on behalf of the fossil fuel industry. That includes the World Petroleum Council, the World Coal Council, as well as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Pascoe Sabido works with the Corporate Europe Observatory, one of the watchdog groups. He says, these people are here to gather information, influence government officials and protect big energy interests. PASCOE SABIDO: Their entire business model is predicated on drilling, digging up, burning fossil fuels. So, of course, they're trying to save their skin. They've got shareholders they need to respond to. They want to make ensure we stay hooked on fossil fuels. LANGFITT: And he thinks the summit should ban them. SABIDO: They shouldn't be here because this is a place for governments. This is a place for global interest. And they're not part of that conversation. LANGFITT: Since they have supplied the energy that's run the economies of the world for 150 years or longer, shouldn't people be talking to them? SABIDO: Very interesting point, but their interest is on burning fossil fuels, so if we're realizing we need to move away from it, then unfortunately, it's really difficult having them part of the conversation. LANGFITT: Sabido likens the oil companies here to Big Tobacco years ago - both financed campaigns to fight the science that showed how much damage their industries caused.

Well, there are plenty of examples on YouTube of what not to do, like this frozen turkey disaster. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED GROUP: Whoa (laughter). UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Are you OK? AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:  So how do you know when the oil is ready? Well, a thermometer is an indispensable tool. Researchers in the field of fluid dynamics have an additional trick - listen to the sound of the oil. (SOUNDBITE OF OIL SIZZLING)CHANG: The scientists were inspired by a classic kitchen hack used to test tempura frying oil. You wet the pointy end of a wooden chopstick. You stick it into the oil. And then you listen. TADD TRUSCOTT: And if you hear really loud popping or crackling, it's probably too hot. (SOUNDBITE OF OIL POPPING)TRUSCOTT: And then if you don't hear anything, it's usually too cold. CORNISH: Tadd Truscott is with the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology in Saudi Arabia. He says, when you get the oil just right. . . TRUSCOTT: There's sort of this nice bubbling sound. It almost feels kind of like a song (laughter) to some people - is how it was described to me once (laughter). CHANG: His team wanted to see what kinds of bubbles form at different temperatures and how those bubbles, in turn, create this sizzling song. So they repeated the chopstick test at different oil temperatures while recording audio and high-speed video. CORNISH: Truscott's collaborator, Rafsan Rabbi of Utah State University, says that when you dip a wet chopstick into hot oil, the water starts to vaporize, forming water bubbles that rise to the surface. Air bubbles form, too. RAFSAN RABBI: Now, that water bubble and those air bubbles would be different in shape and size, and that would dictate the amount of noise that you're actually hearing, and that would degrade the frequency of the noise that you're hearing. CHANG: Now, if at this point you're wondering why scientists care so much about fried foods, Truscott says the phenomena they're studying go way beyond the fryer. TRUSCOTT: In fact, even in your car, every time your piston - every time there's combustion, a lot of these exact same behaviors are happening. And so all of this is important in our daily lives. We just don't realize it. It's all happening behind the scenes. CORNISH: Real-world applications are fine, but how many cooks have seen their work? Collaborator Akihito Kiyama a postdoctoral researcher at Utah State, says he looked close to home for a willing chef. AKIHITO KIYAMA: Oh, yeah, my wife. Yeah (laughter). TRUSCOTT: Yeah, Aki's wife was our go-to chef (laughter). CHANG: Kiyama will present the results next week in Phoenix at the 74th Annual Meeting of the Division of Fluid Dynamics. No word yet on how many fry chefs will be there. (SOUNDBITE OF DEVO SONG, \"GUT FEELING\") AILSA CHANG, HOST:   Thanksgiving is just 10 days away, and perhaps you're planning to brave the deep fryer this year. Well, there are plenty of examples on YouTube of what not to do, like this frozen turkey disaster. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED GROUP: Whoa (laughter). UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Are you OK? AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:   So how do you know when the oil is ready? Well, a thermometer is an indispensable tool. Researchers in the field of fluid dynamics have an additional trick - listen to the sound of the oil. (SOUNDBITE OF OIL SIZZLING) CHANG: The scientists were inspired by a classic kitchen hack used to test tempura frying oil. You wet the pointy end of a wooden chopstick. You stick it into the oil. And then you listen. TADD TRUSCOTT: And if you hear really loud popping or crackling, it's probably too hot. (SOUNDBITE OF OIL POPPING) TRUSCOTT: And then if you don't hear anything, it's usually too cold. CORNISH: Tadd Truscott is with the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology in Saudi Arabia. He says, when you get the oil just right. . . TRUSCOTT: There's sort of this nice bubbling sound. It almost feels kind of like a song (laughter) to some people - is how it was described to me once (laughter). CHANG: His team wanted to see what kinds of bubbles form at different temperatures and how those bubbles, in turn, create this sizzling song. So they repeated the chopstick test at different oil temperatures while recording audio and high-speed video. CORNISH: Truscott's collaborator, Rafsan Rabbi of Utah State University, says that when you dip a wet chopstick into hot oil, the water starts to vaporize, forming water bubbles that rise to the surface.

A NASA spacecraft set to launch this week will try to change the trajectory of an asteroid, which could come in handy if Earth is ever threatened by a rock from space.

NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE, BYLINE: NASA keeps watch on the biggest asteroids around Earth. For the foreseeable future, none are a threat. But there are plenty of smaller rocks - the size that could take out a city - that still haven't been found and tracked. The space agency is working on a new telescope to search for more. And it's also about to make its first-ever attempt to knock an asteroid off course. Nancy Chabot is this mission's coordination lead. She's a scientist at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory.

CHABOT: So DART is demonstrating asteroid deflection. It is absolutely not asteroid disruption, which is how it goes a lot of times in the movies. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Rather than trying to obliterate an asteroid, DART will just give one a little nudge, by ramming a spacecraft into it. Have no fear; the target asteroid is no danger now, and there's no chance that this mission could send it careening towards us. CHABOT: There is absolutely no way that the DART pest is a threat to the Earth. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Chabot says the DART spacecraft will travel over 6 million miles to a big asteroid that's orbited by a smaller asteroid. It's the smaller one that's the target. This space rock is about 500 feet across. CHABOT: And so it's like a small golf cart running in to a Great Pyramid. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Except this golf cart will be going 15,000 miles per hour. The impact will happen next autumn. Elena Adams is a mission systems engineer at the Applied Physics Laboratory. She says in the last few hours, she and her colleagues will simply watch and wait as the spacecraft hones in on its target, sending pictures back to Earth as it gets closer and closer. ELENA ADAMS: It is four hours of watching paint dry but kind of terrifying at the same time because the spacecraft's completely autonomous. GREENFIELDBOYCE: In the final seconds before impact, scientists will get their first good look at this space rock. It's so small and so far away the telescopes can't really see it. Instead, they see this pair of asteroids as little more than a point of light. But it dims whenever the small asteroid passes in front of its larger companion. It normally orbits once every 11 hours and 55 minutes. But the impact should slightly shorten that time period. By how many minutes, no one knows. Adams says everyone will watch closely. ADAMS: And just see, how does it react to being pushed? GREENFIELDBOYCE: She says this test should help NASA understand what its options are if it ever spots a space rock headed this way.

It walked from Oregon all the way down to Southern California, where, last month, a vehicle hit and killed it. NPR's Nathan Rott reports the story of that wolf and its tragic end illustrates some of the very real challenges facing our country's wildlife. NATHAN ROTT, BYLINE: Not all wolves have followings. OR93, as the male wolf was named when it was collared by Oregon biologists, was different. Amaroq Weiss is the senior wolf advocate for the Center for Biological Diversity. AMAROQ WEISS: OR93 is a wolf that has captured international imagination from the first moment he came into California until his really untimely, tragic death that we just learned of this last month. ROTT: Not because of his white-gray color or really anything else about him - by most standards, OR93 was your typical wolf. A little after he turned 1, he dispersed from his pack. Think of it like a teenager leaving home, which is normal for young wolves. What was remarkable about OR93 was how far he traveled. WEISS: In the first three months of his travels here, he went through 14, 15 counties, went straight down to southern Sierra, far more south than any other wolves have gone so far. And then he did something even more surprising. He cut across the entire Central Valley. ROTT: . . . Crossing freeways and highways, showing up on a game camera in Kern County, Calif. (SOUNDBITE OF GRASS RUSTLING)ROTT: That's him crunching through dry grass. WEISS: And he ended up in our coastal counties. ROTT: Places, Weiss says, that haven't seen a wolf in two to 300 years. California, like most of North America, used to be wolf habitat. There were an estimated 2 million wolves across the lower 48 U. S. states before colonists hunted, trapped, poisoned and killed them to make way for livestock and towns. Today, there are only about 6,500 wolves in the contiguous U. S. , mostly in the upper Great Lakes and northern Rockies, enough, The Trump administration decided, to take them off of the endangered species list. John Vucetich is a wolf researcher at Michigan Tech University. JOHN VUCETICH: Gray wolves are not federally protected in the lower 48. And what that means is that each state where there's a resident population of wolves, the state gets to decide what the management is all about. ROTT: In Wisconsin, Montana and Idaho, wolves can now be hunted. Last year, more than 20% of Wisconsin's entire wolf population was killed in less than three days. Idaho has placed bounties on wolves and approved legislation that would allow 90% of the state's wolves to be killed. VUCETICH: Wolves, for better or for worse, are symbols to humans. They're symbols of nature. And wolves are wrapped up with all of the things that we love about nature and all of the things that we hate about nature and fear about nature. ROTT: The same, Vucetich says, could be said about other large carnivores that European settlers nearly wiped off the landscape. And that's the big challenge. As the Biden administration pledges to protect biodiversity and stall the extinction crisis, much of that will fall to states. State wildlife agencies, after all, manage the vast majority of the country's wildlife. And how one state values a wolf like OR93 may be very different than the next. Nathan Rott, NPR News.

ROTT: Not because of his white-gray color or really anything else about him - by most standards, OR93 was your typical wolf. A little after he turned 1, he dispersed from his pack. Think of it like a teenager leaving home, which is normal for young wolves. What was remarkable about OR93 was how far he traveled. WEISS: In the first three months of his travels here, he went through 14, 15 counties, went straight down to southern Sierra, far more south than any other wolves have gone so far. And then he did something even more surprising. He cut across the entire Central Valley. ROTT: . . . Crossing freeways and highways, showing up on a game camera in Kern County, Calif. (SOUNDBITE OF GRASS RUSTLING) ROTT: That's him crunching through dry grass. WEISS: And he ended up in our coastal counties. ROTT: Places, Weiss says, that haven't seen a wolf in two to 300 years. California, like most of North America, used to be wolf habitat. There were an estimated 2 million wolves across the lower 48 U. S. states before colonists hunted, trapped, poisoned and killed them to make way for livestock and towns. Today, there are only about 6,500 wolves in the contiguous U. S. , mostly in the upper Great Lakes and northern Rockies, enough, The Trump administration decided, to take them off of the endangered species list. John Vucetich is a wolf researcher at Michigan Tech University. JOHN VUCETICH: Gray wolves are not federally protected in the lower 48. And what that means is that each state where there's a resident population of wolves, the state gets to decide what the management is all about. ROTT: In Wisconsin, Montana and Idaho, wolves can now be hunted. Last year, more than 20% of Wisconsin's entire wolf population was killed in less than three days. Idaho has placed bounties on wolves and approved legislation that would allow 90% of the state's wolves to be killed. VUCETICH: Wolves, for better or for worse, are symbols to humans. They're symbols of nature. And wolves are wrapped up with all of the things that we love about nature and all of the things that we hate about nature and fear about nature. ROTT: The same, Vucetich says, could be said about other large carnivores that European settlers nearly wiped off the landscape. And that's the big challenge. As the Biden administration pledges to protect biodiversity and stall the extinction crisis, much of that will fall to states. State wildlife agencies, after all, manage the vast majority of the country's wildlife. And how one state values a wolf like OR93 may be very different than the next. Nathan Rott, NPR News.

It's the latest evidence that omicron is quickly spreading far from southern Africa, where it had been identified earlier by scientists in Botswana and South Africa. Yesterday, omicron was declared a variant of concern by the World Health Organization. The U. S. and other nations have responded by announcing new travel restrictions and testing requirements for arriving airline passengers. Let's underscore this. There's still a lot we don't know about the new variant. So we want to begin today by going through some of the big questions that remain about this strain, and to help us with that, we have once again called upon Bill Hanage. He's an associate professor of epidemiology at Harvard's T. H. Chan School of Public Health. Bill Hanage, welcome. BILL HANAGE: Thanks for having me on the show, David. FOLKENFLIK: For starters, can you tell us the basics of what we do know at this point about the omicron variant? HANAGE: Well, I want to start by reiterating exactly what you just said, which is there's a heck of a lot that we don't know. What we know is that a few days ago, the South African authorities reported that they were seeing a large number of cases of a variant with a very large number of mutations, way beyond what you would expect, and that they had reason to think, from a particular set of test results, that this had not spread just in one small location but was in several regions around the country. Shortly after that, we heard that cases of omicron had been introduced to Hong Kong and also Belgium. And basically, things have been moving very quickly since then, and we're still scrambling, trying to figure out exactly what sort of beast we're dealing with. FOLKENFLIK: There have been COVID variants before, like delta, that have caused concerns. Why is this one considered particularly worrisome to scientists like yourself? HANAGE: Well, a lot of it has to do with just the sheer number of mutations it has because it's much too early to actually have really good epidemiological evidence. But if you look within the spike, which is the protein which is targeted by the vaccines, we see that there are about 30 or more mutations - 10 of them in the receptor-binding domain, which attaches to cells alone. And lots of these are mutations we've seen before. And so if you put them all together, this looks particularly worrying. However, I want to emphasize that how something looks doesn't necessarily translate into how it behaves. I can give you an example of that. FOLKENFLIK: Sure. HANAGE: Do you remember beta? FOLKENFLIK: Yes. Yes, I do. HANAGE: Yeah. Beta was the variant that everybody was worried about before because it was the one that was best able to sidestep neutralizing immunity or neutralizing antibodies. However, beta didn't really go anywhere. This is only the most recent thing, and we're only starting to learn how transmissible it is. It looks like the answer is quite transmissible, but how exactly how transmissible we don't know yet. FOLKENFLIK: At this point, without being unduly alarming, is there any reason to think that the omicron variant could overcome the vaccines that have been plunked in people's arms and are currently coursing around their bodies? HANAGE: I think it's unlikely to think that it will totally overcome it. Having said that, I don't think that we know enough at the moment to be absolutely sure about the quality of protection that they will provide. Let me take a step back and just point out the really important things that we don't know and that we're going to be finding out. The first thing is going to be exactly how this virus interacts with neutralizing antibodies. We're going to get that information on a time scale of a few weeks. The next thing we want to know is how transmissible it is. That'll be a little bit longer. But the epidemiology will be done, and we'll be starting to figure that out a little after that. The data upon the severity of infections is going to take much longer to come in, and that's the thing which is really important because even if it's able to cause infections in vaccinated people, I mean, delta could cause infections in vaccinated people, but they were mild. They were milder than they would have been in the alternative, unvaccinated state, and that's what really matters. FOLKENFLIK: Ahead of this long holiday weekend here in the U. S. , there were already concerns that people are traveling more. There could be spikes in COVID cases around the country. Now there's news of this new variant. What should Americans be paying attention right now in thinking about the pandemic? HANAGE: One thing that I think is worth remembering is that we have, for a long time, had people talking about when the pandemic is done. But pandemics don't end in that way. You don't get a sort of 21-gun salute to say, ooh, it's over. Instead, it's a long, drawn-out process of fighting whatever the virus throws at us next. There's still a lot of stuff that can be done. Vaccines are likely to be at least somewhat protective and quite possibly very protective against it. So if you haven't got your shot, get your shot. If you have, just be prepared to roll with what happens and what comes at us next. FOLKENFLIK: So how should Americans envision managing life in the pandemic for the foreseeable future? Will there always be a new variant to worry about? HANAGE: Well, this is the issue that I rose earlier. I mean, it's not only the existence of the new variant. It's the type of disease it causes. The boosters seem to generate a lot of protection, and we haven't got any evidence of how this variant transmits within a context like that yet. It may also be the case - I want to point out - that - and this is something which is very important - not all networks are alike. I've long been trying to argue for folks to be using things like rapid tests if they are in contact with groups of older people, especially older, unvaccinated people, or those who have not yet received boosters. That kind of thing is going to be the case going forward. Whether or not this is going to cause a serious public health problem in the coming months I don't know enough to say at the moment, and I don't think anybody does, honestly. However, I can tell you the kind of things we're going to be looking at - first of all, lab studies of neutralization by antibodies generated through vaccination. And then there'll be the epidemiology information about the transmission and, importantly, the information about the type of disease which it causes. Those things could conceivably be very optimistic, or they might not. But at the moment, we don't know. And that uncertainty is something which a lot of people find it hard to deal with. But unfortunately, it's part of living through a pandemic. FOLKENFLIK: We've been hearing from Bill Hanage. He's an associate professor and epidemiologist at Harvard's T. H.

Kerry Sheridan of member station WUSF has this report. KERRY SHERIDAN, BYLINE: COVID-19 patients now make up 1 in 10 lung transplants in the United States, according to data from the United Network for Organ Sharing, or UNOS. DAVID KLASSEN: They are accumulating on a steady basis, so it's very much a real thing. SHERIDAN: That's David Klassen, chief medical officer for UNOS. KLASSEN: If there were more lungs available for transplants, I believe the numbers would be greater than they are. SHERIDAN: UNOS's figures show lung transplants for COVID patients rose tenfold between the first year of the pandemic and 2021. Meanwhile, their data also shows transplants for other top lung diseases like emphysema, cystic fibrosis and pulmonary fibrosis so far this year have fallen. David Mulligan, the chair of transplantation at Yale, says it's a troubling trend. DAVID MULLIGAN: It's happening in the U. S. It's also happening in Canada. There was just a paper out from western Canada about this is causing a huge surge in the number of lung transplants there. It's a big problem. SHERIDAN: And the operations are expensive, costing around $1. 2 million for a double lung transplant. So the rise in COVID-related transplants is forcing doctors to grapple with how to best manage who gets them, especially now that vaccines are widely available. Here's Mulligan again. MULLIGAN: When somebody contracts such severe COVID, they need a lung transplant. And they got it, refusing to get a vaccine. It's a really ethical dilemma. How can they just jump in and take a lung away from somebody who's sick or has been doing the best they can to take care of themselves and avoid getting COVID? SHERIDAN: Transplant centers weigh a lot of different factors when listing people who need an organ, but how people came to be sick isn't usually among them. People who smoke can be eligible for a lung transplant, just like people who drink alcohol in excess can also be listed for a new liver, usually if they've stayed smoke-free or sober for six months. Olivia Kates is an assistant professor at Johns Hopkins. She says not judging patient's past behavior is pretty standard in medicine, but future behavior when it comes to transplants is fair game. OLIVIA KATES: I think they should be subject to the same expectation maybe, that they should either be vaccinated or be able to demonstrate immunity to COVID-19 going forward so that their next set of lungs is not subject to the same risk. SHERIDAN: Some transplant centers have said patients will lose their spot on the list if they're not vaccinated against coronavirus. But other transplant doctors say eliminating anyone who hasn't had a COVID vaccine from even being considered for an organ may be unfair because it could exclude racial, religious or ethnic groups that tend to have lower vaccination rates. The current system of wait-listing people for transplant prioritizes people who are sickest and have the best chance of being able to benefit and keep the organ, people like 41-year-old Vezna Hang. He got COVID in March of this year, not long after moving to Tampa from New York. VEZNA HANG: One day, I just looked in the mirror and saw that, you know, my lips and my fingertips were blue. SHERIDAN: The father of a 5-year-old, Hang was otherwise healthy and had no underlying conditions. Getting COVID caused inflammation in his lungs that led to permanent scars. A transplant was his only option. HANG: From day to day, you know, there was times that I honestly didn't think I was going to make it. And to leave behind my son - that was heavily on my mind. SHERIDAN: Hang was not vaccinated when he fell ill with COVID-19. Florida didn't open up vaccine access to his age group, 40 and up, until late March - after he got infected. But Hang understands people who were unsure about getting the shot. He was one of them before he got sick. HANG: From what I experienced and being inside the hospital setting and seeing all the people that weren't vaccinated being hospitalized, it really made me push to get myself vaccinated, my family and, you know, encourage my friends. SHERIDAN: Doctors say often, the patients aren't difficult to convince. It's their caregivers who, if unvaccinated, could put a patient's life at risk. That's because people who have a transplant must take immune-suppressing drugs for the rest of their lives to prevent their bodies from rejecting the new organ.

NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce reports that researchers have taken a new look at some other ancient tracks. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE, BYLINE: Walking on two legs is a distinctively human thing to do. It seems to make us different than other living primates. ELLISON MCNUTT: It's a very strange way of kind of moving through the world. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Ellison McNutt is a biological anthropologist at the Ohio University Heritage College of Osteopathic Medicine. She studies upright walking and says most four-legged creatures find it challenging. MCNUTT: If you imagine asking your dog to do that, they're really wobbly. They're really uncomfortable. They don't want to do that. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Yet humans did it early in their history. For example, at one site in Tanzania, a volcanic eruption over 3 1/2 million years ago covered the landscape with ash and preserved all kinds of tracks that had been left in the mud. MCNUTT: So we're talking elephants and bunnies, birds and all kinds of things walked across this landscape, and they left these amazing footprints. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Including one set of footprints that look quite human. MCNUTT: And this trackway has been reconstructed to belong to a hominin, an early human ancestor called Australopithecus afarensis. And this is the same species that the quite famous fossil Lucy belongs to. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Now, when these were discovered back in the 1970s, workers also found a track of five footprints that looked more mysterious. Researchers speculated that these prints were created by a small bear walking upright. MCNUTT: They were tentative about it and acknowledged that, you know, we don't have a good answer for this. This is a reasonable answer. Bears do stand up and walk upright. GREENFIELDBOYCE: McNutt had actually been studying how bears do that when she came across a mention of these fossil tracks, which had been mostly forgotten for decades. She and her colleagues decided to reexamine them using modern technology. They did detailed comparisons to footprints left by humans, chimpanzees and young bears living in a sanctuary. MCNUTT: We ended up with four little juvenile bears that we had stand up and walk through mud for either applesauce or maple syrup as their reward at the end of it. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Their results appear in the journal Nature. And it turns out the fossil footprints just aren't bear-like. Instead, there's signs of more humanlike features, such as a big toe. McNutt says it looks like there were two early human species walking around back then. In fact, they could have seen each other go by. MCNUTT: The nature of fossil footprints and how these trackways are made is that they're in the same layer of mud. So these are likely made within the scale of hours to days from one another. GREENFIELDBOYCE: All of this has convinced Stephanie Melillo. She's a paleoanthropologist at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Germany. STEPHANIE MELILLO: We see there the presence of two different kinds of hominin ancestors together in the same environment, in the same place, at the same time. MELILLO: She says one of the biggest questions about human evolution is why our ancestors started walking upright. MELILLO: And I don't think that we really have a good answer to that question yet. MELILLO: But these footprints suggest that multiple human species co-existed while walking upright in different ways. Nell Greenfieldboyce, NPR News.

Yesterday, the first case was found in the U. S. , a person from California who had recently traveled internationally. Now, today, more cases, one in Minnesota. That person had recently attended a convention in New York City. And another case in Colorado. Scientists say it is not a surprise that cases are turning up in the U. S. , but the coming days will be critical for understanding just how widespread omicron is. NPR's Will Stone reports. WILL STONE, BYLINE: Dr. Charles Chiu suspected the sample being sent to his lab might be omicron. It was 3:00 p. m. on Tuesday, and Chiu, who is a virologist at UC San Francisco, had just received an email from the local health department. It said that a positive COVID-19 case had been identified in someone who had recently traveled to South Africa. CHARLES CHIU: They wanted to get an answer very quickly. I realized that there was certainly a possibility that this is a case of omicron. STONE: Chiu's lab does genomic sequencing to understand what variants are circulating in the Bay Area. CHIU: We managed to get the sample in the laboratory by 6:00 p. m. We did actually two analyses simultaneously. STONE: The first was a PCR test, what's generally used by labs to diagnose a COVID-19 case. Except this particular PCR test happens to be good at screening for omicron because it can pick up what's called a spike gene dropout. CHIU: The idea behind spike gene dropout is that, PCR tests, they typically look for multiple targets on the virus. One common target is a spike gene. But what's interesting about omicron is omicron has a deletion, specific deletion in the spike gene. STONE: That deletion causes the PCR tests to look different. This is the result of a mutation in omicron. CHIU: We are fortunate in that at least spike gene dropout is a very good screening tool, but it doesn't prove that it's omicron. STONE: You still have to sequence it, which can take a bit more time. For that, Chiu used a small, pocket-sized sequencer, and by close to midnight, he had confirmed his suspicions. STONE: It's very likely that this is the tip of the iceberg. STONE: Scientists in the U. S. already had a sense of how to look for omicron, thanks to an early heads-up from South Africa and Botswana. Earlier in the pandemic, the U. S. had struggled to ramp up its surveillance for variants. But Alexandra Phelan at Georgetown Center for Global Health Science and Security says the country is definitely in a better place now. ALEXANDRA PHELAN: We've actually had quite a significant increase in our capability to conduct the genetic sequencing and then to be tracking what's going on with variants. But right now, this is really, I guess, the first full test we have of that system being up and running. STONE: This week, the CDC director said about 1 in every 7 positive PCR tests are now being sequenced in the U. S. That's a big increase. But Phelan says one challenge is that not everywhere in the country is doing the same amount of it. Some places, like California, are doing a lot of sequencing, but in others. . . PHELAN: In some states we're sequencing, you know, less than 1%. Getting a bit more consistency across the nation will be critical. STONE: The more testing that's done, the better positioned the U. S. will be to track the spread of omicron. But the testing is a mix of PCR tests and rapid antigen tests. Dr. Alex Greninja at the UW Medicine Clinical Virology Lab in Seattle says these rapid tests are great and convenient. ALEX GRENINGER: At the same time, they're not as good at that next portion. They don't get reported to public health as much, they don't get sequenced. And so as that grows as a growing share of testing in the United States, that's an area that we're sort of dark to. STONE: No one wants omicron to be in the U. S. , but Dr. Chiu at UCSF says there's a silver lining to finding it here. We can now study it more easily.

Until the 20th century, one type of white paint made from lead reigned supreme. FRANCESCA CASADIO: There wasn't a painter for centuries that would not use lead white. MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:  Francesca Casadio is a Ph. D. chemist at the Art Institute of Chicago. She says lead white, as it's called, was unparalleled. CASADIO: It gives this dense and this rich - and it's kind of - it has a buttery consistency. So it's very opaque when you apply, and then you can do highlights. And it will, when mixed with oil, retain also the texture. SHAPIRO: Now that paint is telling us new stories about art and the world that shaped it because lead mines in various parts of Europe extracted lead with different chemical qualities. And those different flavors of lead, or isotopes, made their way into the paint and can be differentiated in modern labs. KELLY: Casadio likens the isotopes of lead in a paint sample to tiny, charged marbles. CASADIO: And some are heavier, and some are lighter. And then you made them run into a track. And the lighter ones are coming in first, and the heavier ones are coming in later. And so you can count and track them. KELLY: Scientists in Amsterdam have used that technique to analyze more than 70 Dutch paintings from 1588 to 1700, including works by Rembrandt and Rubens. PAOLO D'IMPORZANO: Sampling many paintings made in different time give us an idea of the variation of the lead isotopes used by the artists in that time frame. SHAPIRO: Paolo D'Imporzano of the Free University led the study in the journal Science Advances. He says changes in lead chemistry reflect changes in history, and they see that in the 1640s with the English Civil War. D'IMPORZANO: We know that warfare was requiring a lot of lead. The civil war disrupt or change the lead supply also to produce lead white, and that's what we see in the pigments. KELLY: Clues like that helped the team conclude that one masterpiece painted by Rembrandt's pupil Willem Drost may not have been painted during his time in Venice. D'IMPORZANO: The isotopic signature of this painting is really similar to the one of one painting coming from a Rembrandt studio in the same period, so the painting is most likely to be from his period in Amsterdam. KELLY: Francesca Casadio says science like this is just one clue used to solve arts mysteries. CASADIO: It's really a sort of a detective story that needs not just one Sherlock Holmes but a team that have very different expertise - the historian, the economic historian, the art historian, the research scientist. SHAPIRO: And as for us, the viewers, next time you visit an art museum, pay attention to the paint. It might tell a deeper story than you think. (SOUNDBITE OF MOSS OF AURA'S \"SLICK\") ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:   Now we turn to a detective story involving the Dutch masters and white paint. Until the 20th century, one type of white paint made from lead reigned supreme. FRANCESCA CASADIO: There wasn't a painter for centuries that would not use lead white. MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:   Francesca Casadio is a Ph. D. chemist at the Art Institute of Chicago. She says lead white, as it's called, was unparalleled. CASADIO: It gives this dense and this rich - and it's kind of - it has a buttery consistency. So it's very opaque when you apply, and then you can do highlights. And it will, when mixed with oil, retain also the texture. SHAPIRO: Now that paint is telling us new stories about art and the world that shaped it because lead mines in various parts of Europe extracted lead with different chemical qualities. And those different flavors of lead, or isotopes, made their way into the paint and can be differentiated in modern labs. KELLY: Casadio likens the isotopes of lead in a paint sample to tiny, charged marbles. CASADIO: And some are heavier, and some are lighter. And then you made them run into a track. And the lighter ones are coming in first, and the heavier ones are coming in later. And so you can count and track them.

Hundreds of billions of dollars could change hands in the coming years through a global market in greenhouse emissions. Last month's climate summit in Glasgow, Scotland, approved the new trading system. In theory, it's an efficient way to fight climate change. But there are pitfalls. NPR's Dan Charles has the story. DAN CHARLES, BYLINE: Carbon trading takes buyers and sellers, and they were all there at the Glasgow summit in a giant exhibition hall. The buyers came from big companies that burn fossil fuels. AHMED IDRESS: My name is Ahmed Idress, and I work for Capital Power in Canada. CHARLES: Idress' company burns gas and coal to make electricity, which pumps carbon dioxide into the air, heating up the planet. IDRESS: The company total emission is about 11. 5 million ton. CHARLES: And Canada is now taxing those carbon emissions. IDRESS: As of today, you pay about $40 a ton. Next year, it's going to be $50. The federal government is asking that the price to continue to escalate to $170 by 2030. CHARLES: Capital Power is cutting that tax bill a little by switching to cleaner energy, but it has another option under a system set up by the province of Alberta, where its plants are located. It can cancel out those emissions by buying carbon credits. It buys them from other companies in Alberta that earn them by doing something to cut their emissions, like capturing the greenhouse gas methane from cow manure. This is emissions trading. The theory is it's more efficient to let companies buy their greenhouse gas reductions from whomever can do it most cheaply and easily. Maybe that's dairy farmers. Kelley Kizzier from the Environmental Defense Fund says interest in emissions trading systems has been booming. KELLEY KIZZIER: People are starting to understand that with this global crisis, carbon markets provide a really important tool. CHARLES: California has an emissions trading system. The European Union does, too. And now those markets might be able to link up globally. The U. N. climate summit in Glasgow agreed on some rules for these international trades. Kizzier says it opens up new possibilities for companies like Capital Power. KIZZIER: So let's say that a company in Alberta wants to buy credits from Brazil. CHARLES: There now are rules for how to handle that transaction. And a U. N. agency can decide which actions, like building a wind farm or restoring a forest, are truly valid for earning credits. Some companies and countries are hoping to make a lot of money from this, which brings us to the potential sellers. Gabriella Dorlhiac from the International Chamber of Commerce in Brazil was representing a lot of them at the climate meeting in Glasgow. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)GABRIELLA DORLHIAC: Brazil really positioning itself as a massive supplier, since essentially carbon credits are a product. CHARLES: She told her audience that Brazil could sell up to $100 billion worth of carbon credits over the next decade, mostly from protecting forests or expanding them. Kelley Kizzier from the Environmental Defense Fund says that's great. KIZZIER: That's exactly what we want. I think people should be looking at this as a revenue opportunity and as a way that we get finance flowing from developed to developing countries. CHARLES: It's developing countries that need money most to deal with climate change. But a lot of people are unconvinced that emissions trading is a good idea. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTERS: (Chanting) No more zombie credits. No more zombie credits. CHARLES: There were protesters in Glasgow who say these markets just let polluters keep polluting, for instance, through bad accounting. The zombie credits that those people were chanting about are credits that countries like Brazil earned years ago but never sold because there wasn't much demand for them. Now those old credits might get sold as carbon offsets, but they won't bring any new reductions in emissions. Or let's say a country is already protecting its forests just because that's the law, but then it also gets carbon credits for doing it. Those credits don't really represent a reduction in carbon emissions. Erika Lennon, an attorney with the Center for International Environmental Law, says the climate situation now is way too dire to let companies buy offsets for their emissions. ERIKA LENNON: You're not reducing anything; you're just sort of trading around the world. And what we really need to do is reduce the overall emissions. CHARLES: Many economists say for emissions trading to really work, countries will have to impose limits on those overall emissions that are much tighter than most have been willing to set so far. That's what it will take to boost demand for credits - driving up their price and convincing companies that it's just too expensive to keep burning fossil fuels. Dan Charles, NPR News.

For example, in October of this year, Donald Trump's son, Eric, spoke to anti-vaccine activists at a conference. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)ERIC TRUMP: We love the United States of America. It's the greatest country on Earth - greatest country on Earth. CORNISH: NPR's Geoff Brumfiel explains what's drawing them together. And a warning - this piece contains strong language. GEOFF BRUMFIEL, BYLINE: Eric Trump delivered his half-hour speech to thousands of people at the Gaylord Opryland Resort in Nashville, Tenn. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE: U. S. A. U. S. A. U. S. A. BRUMFIEL: Some of his biggest applause lines came when he attacked the COVID vaccine mandates. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)TRUMP: Do you want to get a vaccine? Do you not? Do you want to be left alone or not? Do you want to own a firearm? So do I. BRUMFIEL: This all sounded really different from what came just hours before. On the same stage, an anti-vaccine activist named Carrie Madej claimed the vaccines contained microscopic technology designed to turn humans into cyborgs. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)CARRIE MADEJ: They're trying to put another kind of nervous system inside of you, but - an AI kind. These are my hypotheses. I encourage you to do your own research. BRUMFIEL: It's those sort of fringe views that kept political figures away from this conference in the past. But as America heads into an election year, there seems to be a magnetic energy drawing the political far right and the anti-vaccine movement towards each other. The promise is more power for both sides, but the cost could be thousands of American lives. To understand what's going on, first, you need to understand where the two sides are coming from. The anti-vaccine movement has not always been politically aligned. DEL BIGTREE: The truth is, I'm still a registered Democrat. BRUMFIEL: Del Bigtree is a major anti-vaccine activist. He's struggled to make his message appeal to liberals, but it seems to tap into something on the political right. He still remembers the first time he noticed. He was invited to speak about a documentary he'd written and produced at a conservative women's group in Texas. They loved it. BIGTREE: Clearly, I was shocked as a lifelong, liberal progressive that I was, you know, hugging and hanging out and having a great time with a bunch of extremely conservative mothers and grandmothers. BRUMFIEL: Bigtree has been banned from social media platforms like YouTube for making false claims about the dangers of COVID vaccines. But as the pandemic has dragged on, his conservative audience keeps growing. Often, he speaks at conferences alongside people who claim the election was rigged and promoters of QAnon conspiracy theories. BIGTREE: Unless there's going to be a white supremacist, you know, on the stage, then - you know, or I find out that there's something that I truly find distasteful, then I see that stage as simply an audience that I want to have hear this message. BRUMFIEL: It's a numbers game. He wants to grow his movement, and he'll talk to anyone who will listen. Now, on the other side of this alliance are far-right conservatives like Trump's former political adviser, Roger Stone. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)ROGER STONE: Most of you know my story. BRUMFIEL: He was convicted of lying to Congress about the Trump campaign's ties to Russia and later pardoned by Trump. Stone was invited to this conference by anti-vaccine activists Ty and Charlene Bollinger. He sees vaccines as a potent wedge issue that can motivate conservative voters in the upcoming election cycle. Do you think that, going forward, the vaccines are going to be something that people are willing to fight over? STONE: In an enormous amount of public polling, which I think is honest - I mean, legitimate polling shows that it is. So we don't get to decide. We get - we read what the public is saying as a political strategist, and you have to respond accordingly. I think it is highly likely that this will be an issue in the 2022 elections. BRUMFIEL: Vaccine mandates may be a good way to get out the conservative vote. It's a fight about the role of government and personal liberty. But add in the views of anti-vaccine activists, and that whole fight gets punched up to another level. Just listen to Del Bigtree. BIGTREE: I believe that this vaccine approach, this vaccine itself, this brand-new technology is so incredibly dangerous that we are actually putting our species at risk. BRUMFIEL: That kind of rhetoric, even though it's false, creates an existential crisis. It's this synergy between real politics and imagined dangers that's bringing these two movements together. But there's a side effect. Many thousands of conservative Americans are dying from COVID, in part because they're being pummeled with a lot of bad information about the vaccines. Liz Hamel heads public opinion research with the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan health care think tank. She says misinformation is now a major barrier to vaccination. LIZ HAMEL: We find a huge correlation between belief in misinformation and being unvaccinated. BRUMFIEL: And Republicans are on the receiving end of a lot of that misinformation, which comes to them daily through conservative media channels. Kaiser's polling found that 94% of Republicans think one or more false statements about vaccine safety might be true. Hamel has watched over the past eight months as Republican vaccination rates have fallen further and further behind the rest of America. Today. . . HAMEL: An unvaccinated person is three times as likely to lean Republican and as they are to lean Democrat. BRUMFIEL: To see the impact of this vaccination gap, NPR checked COVID-19 death rates against 2020 election results. The trend was clear. Since May, when the vaccines became widely available, counties that voted heavily for Trump experienced nearly three times the death rate from COVID-19 compared to those that voted for President Biden. They also had far lower vaccination rates. When asked about Republicans' low vaccination rates, Roger Stone said this. STONE: Each person must make their own choice. God bless them. BRUMFIEL: So it doesn't bother you? You're not worried about Republicans potentially getting COVID, getting sick, not having the vaccine? STONE: I actually think that the - taking the vaccination probably enhances your chances of getting the disease, so I guess I'd be more concerned if I were a Democrat. BRUMFIEL: That last statement is contrary to all of the scientific and medical data available. Stone also declined to say whether he was vaccinated. ANNETTE MEEKS: He doesn't care if people are dying and he's spreading - pardon my French - [expletive] quasi-medical information. They don't care about that. They just care about winning. That - it's the worst element in American politics today. BRUMFIEL: Annette Meeks is a lifelong Republican. She heads the Freedom Foundation of Minnesota, a conservative think tank. Meeks has seen the data on vaccines, and she's watched people she knows get sick. She is worried. MEEKS: To see people reject those vaccines based on pseudoscience or, worse, lies, and to see lives lost is a tragedy beyond words. BRUMFIEL: But she also says embracing the anti-vaccine movement carries huge political risks for the Republican Party as a whole. That's because elections in states like Minnesota are won and lost in the suburbs, and suburban voters tend to be vaccinated. MEEKS: I believe long-term consequences for the Republican Party will be a lot of those independent suburban voters will look askance at us and say, what is this all about? I got vaccinated. My whole family got vaccinated. And we're just fine. BRUMFIEL: The risks for the Republican Party in lives and votes may be real, but there is little downside for the other group in this alliance, the anti-vaccine movement. Anti-vaccine activist Del Bigtree says he's seeing more people at speaking engagements and getting millions of visitors to his website each week. He's hiring, expanding. And for now, his audience is clear - conservative America. Geoff Brumfiel, NPR News.

MEEKS: To see people reject those vaccines based on pseudoscience or, worse, lies, and to see lives lost is a tragedy beyond words. BRUMFIEL: But she also says embracing the anti-vaccine movement carries huge political risks for the Republican Party as a whole. That's because elections in states like Minnesota are won and lost in the suburbs, and suburban voters tend to be vaccinated. MEEKS: I believe long-term consequences for the Republican Party will be a lot of those independent suburban voters will look askance at us and say, what is this all about? I got vaccinated. My whole family got vaccinated. And we're just fine. BRUMFIEL: The risks for the Republican Party in lives and votes may be real, but there is little downside for the other group in this alliance, the anti-vaccine movement. Anti-vaccine activist Del Bigtree says he's seeing more people at speaking engagements and getting millions of visitors to his website each week. He's hiring, expanding. And for now, his audience is clear - conservative America. Geoff Brumfiel, NPR News. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)", "section": "Untangling Disinformation", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2021 NPR.

AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:  Tim Lamont is a marine biologist at the University of Exeter in the U. K. His team used underwater microphones to record reefs in Indonesia. They're interested in what that soundtrack tells us about the health of a coral ecosystem. KELLY: You see; some reefs in Indonesia have been destroyed by dynamite fishing. LAMONT: Where people literally blow up the reef with a stick of dynamite in order to catch the fish. Obviously, that leaves the rest of the reef in total wreckage. KELLY: The wreckage that remains resembles bleached, faded bones. And as life trickles away, so does all that vibrant sound. CORNISH: But in recent years, the company Mars Inc. - yes, the one that makes Snickers bars - well, they've been working with local communities to restore those degraded reefs. Divers install metal frames underwater. They look like giant metal spiders. And they tie baby corals to the legs and let nature do the rest. LAMONT: The corals grow very quickly. And then in the absence of the threat, they're able to recover the damaged area in two or three years. KELLY: And as Lamont's team reports this week in the Journal of Applied Ecology, when the coral makes a comeback, so does the sound. LAMONT: I think what we're hearing is an ecosystem coming back to life. KELLY: Along with the whoop-whoops of those damselfish. . . LAMONT: There's a sort of knocking sound. (SOUNDBITE OF CLOWNFISH CLICKING)LAMONT: It's a clownfish that makes the sound, and it actually makes the sound by biting together its teeth really, really quickly. And you hear that quite a lot as they talk to each other within the anemone. CORNISH: Lamont says all that chatter is a beacon that attracts more life to the reef, though some of the new inhabitants remain a mystery. LAMONT: One of them - the foghorn sound. . . (SOUNDBITE OF FISH BELLOWING)LAMONT: . . . We kept hearing at sunset. But we couldn't work out what fish was making it. CORNISH: He swam all over the reef, playing back the sound underwater in hopes of finding its maker. LAMONT: I got the fish to reply, but I think it must be quite a shy fish that sits in a hole and hides away because loads of the fish do that. And so I never saw the thing. So the foghorn fish remains a mystery. KELLY: Jennifer Miksis-Olds of the University of New Hampshire was not involved in the work. She says she was excited to see soundscapes being used to monitor reefs. JENNIFER MIKSIS-OLDS: It's been used quite a bit in terrestrial landscapes and restoration, and it's great to see that now being done underwater. CORNISH: Lamont points out that climate change still poses an existential threat to reefs worldwide. But if humanity can rein that in, he says the work proves corals can make a comeback and the fish will sing again. (SOUNDBITE OF NITSUA SONG, \"NEW TOMORROW (FEAT.

Similar promises in the past have not been successful, but there are a few reasons why this one might produce better results. NPR's Dan Charles reports. DAN CHARLES, BYLINE: The new Leaders' Declaration on Forests got rolled out with a flourish at last month's climate summit in Glasgow, Scotland. U. K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson made the case for trees. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRIME MINISTER BORIS JOHNSON: These great, teeming ecosystems, trillion-pillared cathedrals of nature. CHARLES: He announced that countries that control the vast majority of the world's forests are pledging to halt and reverse deforestation by 2030. They include Brazil, Indonesia, Russia, most African countries. But as Johnson left the room, an Indigenous activist from Chad named Hindu Ibrahim took the podium, and she sounded skeptical. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)HINDU IBRAHIM: Some government and company, including in this room, are responsible for the deforestation in many areas. CHARLES: Ibrahim said to the audience, these pledges are great, but let's see what you actually do before the next big climate meeting a year from now. Frances Seymour, an expert on tropical forests at the World Resources Institute, says that's what a lot of people are thinking because promises have not produced results in the past. There have been changes, though, she says, some reasons for hope. For instance. . . FRANCES SEYMOUR: How much progress we've made in being able to detect deforestation through satellite technology. CHARLES: And Seymour says they now also understand much better how to stop it. So what's your favorite success story? SEYMOUR: Well, you know, the big and most significant one was, ironically, in Brazil. CHARLES: She says deforestation there has been driven by land grabbing, people seizing and clearing land, claiming it as their own and then reselling it for cattle grazing or soybean farming. About 15 years ago, a new administration in Brazil started enforcing laws against this. SEYMOUR: So they, you know, started impounding logs and impounding cows, you know, that were being raised on illegally deforested land. CHARLES: The government also recognized forested areas where Indigenous people live as protected areas, which Seymour says really worked. SEYMOUR: You can see it from space. You know, we can see the boundaries of Indigenous territories from space because they are very effective forest stewards. CHARLES: Seymour says deforestation dropped by about 80%. It only surged again when a new government took over and dropped forest protection as a priority. You know, Brazil signed on to this new pledge. Do you trust them? SEYMOUR: (Laughter) Long pause. We would need to see a course correction to have any confidence that this is going to make a difference. CHARLES: There are other places, Seymour says, where the recipe for protecting forests is more complicated. SEYMOUR: Where deforestation is being driven by poverty. And that would be the case in much of sub-Saharan Africa. CHARLES: There, local people are cutting down trees for firewood or to clear land for their own crops. Seymour says you can't just punish them. They need help finding more sustainable ways to earn a living and feed themselves. This latest pledge does have some money behind it. A dozen countries, including the U. S. , have promised $12 billion over the next four years to support Indigenous communities, deforestation, free agriculture and land restoration. Seymour says she and her fellow activists are having nonstop discussions right now about how to make sure the pledges lead to meaningful action. Dan Charles, NPR News.

When they take an opioid to kill that pain, their breathing slows down. Now scientists think they know how pain and respiration are connected in the brain. NPR's Jon Hamilton reports that the discovery could eventually lead to safer pain drugs. JON HAMILTON, BYLINE: Sung Han has been studying the link between pain and breathing in his lab at the Salk Institute in San Diego. But he got a real-world demonstration recently while taking a shower. SUNG HAN: I forgot to change the temperature, and the cold water just suddenly came out and covered my entire body. And then I just - I was breathing really fast. HAMILTON: A typical reaction to what Han calls aversive sensory information - and he thinks he knows the cause. Han's lab has identified a brain circuit in mice that appears to link the emotional experience of pain to breathing rhythm. Han says the circuit involves two populations of brain cells both found in the same small area of the brain stem. HAN: One population regulate pain and the other population regulate breathing, and that's the reason why pain and breathing are interacting each other. HAMILTON: They're linked together. If that's also true in people, it would help explain the mysterious connection between breathing and emotion, which has puzzled scientists for centuries. And the finding, which appears in the journal Neuron, could also have practical applications. That's because both groups of brain cells - the ones for breathing and the ones for pain - respond to opioids. Han says this is why an overdose can be fatal. HAN: The reason why people die is just the opioid suppress the breathing. HAMILTON: One of the scientists who helped show how opioids kill is Dr. Kevin Yackle at the University of California San Francisco. Yackle says until now, most research has focused on either the brain cells involved in pain or the ones involved in breathing. KEVIN YACKLE: The connection between the two is still something that's very new. You know, and perhaps studies like this are some of the first examples of this. HAMILTON: Yackle says understanding the connection could lead to a new type of opioid - one that spares the brain cells that keep us alive. YACKLE: Maybe the molecular mechanism by which opioids silence those neurons is different than the molecular mechanism that's used by opioids to cause analgesia or pain relief. HAMILTON: Yackle says the new study also could point the way toward better drugs to revive a person who has overdosed. YACKLE: The only way right now to reverse all these effects is to give somebody an opioid receptor antagonist like naloxone. HAMILTON: Also known as Narcan - the drug restores normal breathing but it can also induce withdrawal symptoms, which may lead to more drug taking and another overdose. Yackle says a drug that only restored breathing would be a better option. And he says making opioids safer should be a priority in a country where overdoses kill more than 100 people a day. YACKLE: Opioids are the best analgesics, and so finding some way to maintain their capacity as analgesics yet get rid of these negative side effects I think is a really important goal.

I'm Manoush Zomorodi. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ZOMORODI: And ask anyone to predict the future these days, they will likely decline. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE)ANTHONY FAUCI: You know, I'm not going to speculate on that. I want to see what happens right now. ANTHONY MASON: No one can forecast exactly how 2021 will unfold. ELON MUSK: Well, I think this is one of those things that's quite difficult to predict. FAUCI: We just can't predict that. We don't know. ZOMORODI: For many of us, the world feels erratic, volatile. Trying to guess what will happen next seems futile unless you're Amy Webb. AMY WEBB: I'm Amy Webb. I am the CEO of the Future Today Institute and a professor of strategic foresight at the NYU Stern School of Business. ZOMORODI: And, Amy, is it fair to say you're a futurist? WEBB: I am. I'm a quantitative futurist. ZOMORODI: Coolest job title, but can you explain what a quantitative futurist is? Do you see, like - I don't know - spreadsheets in your crystal ball? WEBB: So futurists do not make predictions. Instead, we collect signal data. We model those data, looking for patterns and try to anticipate many plausible futures. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ZOMORODI: Big corporations and governments use Amy's projections to prepare for all kinds of scenarios, including pandemics. WEBB: The type of work that we do results in very big bets, you know, sometimes involving billions or multiple billions of dollars that chief executives and their teams have to place. And we want to make sure that they're prepared. ZOMORODI: But Amy says her research into scientific innovation and technology trends, well, more just regular people need to know about them as well. WEBB: Manoush, like you, I'm a regular person, too. And. . . (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)WEBB: . . . Here's the plight of the regular person. The problem is that we're living through this great transformation. And every one of us who's living today, we're going to have to start making some really difficult choices that impact how we spend our time and what we want our kids to do and the people that we vote for. You know, these are going to be complex decisions. And the good news is that on the horizon, there's a lot of opportunity for, you know, personal growth, for economic growth. But that opportunity comes with some serious associated risks. ZOMORODI: So today on the show, Amy Webb talks us through four categories of innovation and explains how these inventions and ideas could upend the future of travel, wellness and what we value in the world. Amy has actually been on the show before talking about her memoir and TED Talk - both called \"Data, A Love Story\" - about how she hacked an online dating platform. But today, she is back to give us A Glimpse Into the Future. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ZOMORODI: OK. So Amy, you have generously agreed to return to the show. But we are going to do something completely different. You are going to guide us through a selection of TED Talks about some of the big trends in technology. But they're very specific innovations. And you're going to help us put these innovations into context, break down the hype from the real change that could stem from them, and help us understand the impact that they might have on the way that the internet and our lives work. So lots to talk about. WEBB: It'll be fun. ZOMORODI: And I want to start with a category that truly does affect us all, transportation. We can't teleport yet, Amy, but we still need to move our bodies from point A to point B. And this first speaker thinks that one way we will do that is with something called the hyperloop. Josh Giegel is the CEO and co-founder of the Virgin Hyperloop. His 2021 talk is called \"Super Speed, Magnetic Levitation And The Vision Behind The Hyperloop. \" And if you've never heard of the hyperloop - I had not - here is how he describes it. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)JOSH GIEGEL: So hyperloop is a transit system that has a vehicle called a pod inside of a tube about the same size as a subway tunnel, where we suck most but not all of the air out of it - be the equivalent of flying at about 200,000 feet of altitude. This allows us to glide at airline speeds without turbulence for a fraction of the energy consumption - about one-tenth, to be precise, of an aircraft. And that's important because we, as humans, have an innate need for speed. But this obsession with speed and volume is destroying the planet around us. In fact, in the United States, the transportation industry is the single largest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. A hyperloop system can begin to change this trend before the end of the decade by transforming short haul journeys and commutes from hours to minutes. ZOMORODI: OK. This sounds amazing. I'm levitating. I'm getting sucked through a kind of more efficient subway tunnel, essentially, but going as fast as a plane, using one-tenth of the energy that airline travel uses. Amy, tell us more about how it actually works. WEBB: Yeah. OK. So do you remember pneumatic tubes at banks? You put your money in that little canister thing. And then it gets sucked up and delivered to the teller on the inside of the building. So this is not entirely how hyperloop works. But, you know, it gives you at least a visual. ZOMORODI: Yeah. WEBB: So imagine being inside of a very comfortable pod, a closed container, that's capable of traveling, you know, at very, very fast speeds. So if you've ever been at the bank drive-through and you've seen what that tube looks like and how fast things are going, it's kind of the same thing. So we're talking about sort of a pod that is hovering inside of a vacuum tube. And using electric propulsion, it can accelerate gradually, pick up speed and then really take off. And the pods are able to glide along the track using magnetic levitation, which is actually already in use in some train systems, just in a different way around the world - so, like, maglev trains in Japan and China, for example. ZOMORODI: So is it kind of like a subway? Like, would there be stops along the way? What kind of travel or commute would the Hyperloop be best suited for? WEBB: Well, you know, a lot of these plans project speeds of between 700 and 800 miles an hour. ZOMORODI: Holy moly. WEBB: So that's pretty fast. So by the time you get one of these things up to speed, you know, you're not going to want to make a stop every couple of blocks. So instead, this would be more of an equivalent of a - like, a round trip between San Francisco and Los Angeles, which would normally take 12 hours on the road but being able to do it in just one hour. ZOMORODI: It's interesting to me that, like, what you're describing sounds really futuristic. But Josh Giegel says the idea of a hyperloop has actually been around for a while. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)GIEGEL: And 118 years ago, before the Wright brothers' first flight, the thought of humans flying was inconceivable. It was crazy, even. Yet today, we get into a plane 30,000 feet above the ground and think nothing of it. A year after the Wright brothers' historic first flight, another inventor, an American physicist named Robert Goddard, proposed an entirely new form of transportation - the vactrain. He envisioned a high-speed mass transit system where people would travel on the ground, with little to no air resistance, inside of a tube. And today, these renderings of some of the earliest renderings what we call a hyperloop. ZOMORODI: (Laughter) The vactrain. OK, so we've been thinking about zipping our bodies around the Earth for decades. But I got to say, Amy, the newest mode of transport that I have taken recently is, like, a motorized scooter. Have we kind of been at a lull when it comes to innovating transportation? I'm not ready to sign up for Jeff Bezos's visit to the outer edge of the atmosphere. I just want to get places on the planet. And, you know, I feel like we've heard a lot about making all our cars electric, but that's not terribly futuristic. So where are we when it comes to innovating in transportation? WEBB: You know, historically, when we think about the future of transportation, we tend to think of things in the air, not things above the ground slightly or even under the ground. And, you know, we tend to reference \"The Jetsons. \"ZOMORODI: Right. WEBB: Now, when we think about transportation and the future, we tend to reference \"The Jetsons\" because of that scene with the flying car at the beginning, right? ZOMORODI: Right. Yes. WEBB: And, you know - and even if you haven't watched an episode of \"The Jetsons,\" if somebody says Jetsons car, everybody immediately knows what you mean. But here's what's interesting. It was 1917 when a guy named Glenn Curtiss filed a patent for an autoplane (ph), and it was a car with some wings attached to it. So it hopped in the air kind of a few times, and it never really, really flew. But every decade since then, there have been multiple flying car patents and actual flying cars that got designed. ZOMORODI: Wow. WEBB: So the question is, why are we stuck in this vicious cycle of the future of transportation being a thing we already have that happens to be up in the air that doesn't really solve any problems? ZOMORODI: And I - just to get back to the Hyperloop. The - not only have the plans been drawn up, but I was intrigued to hear that the - that they're testing it now with, like, real humans in it, including Josh Giegel himself. Its first ride with real passengers was in November of 2020, and here's him describing what happened. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)GIEGEL: We've created a test track in the deserts outside of Las Vegas. We've operated the system over 500 times and had countless other tests on our subsystems. So by October of 2020, we had run hundreds of tests. We had an independent safety auditor give us the green light, but still, it was nerve-wracking. And on November 8, 2020, we made our first attempt. So at our test site, my colleague Sara and I climbed into that can-like vehicle, suspended by magnetic levitation, at a near-vacuum environment, and the countdown began. In those 15 seconds, we showed the world that what was deemed ludicrous over a hundred years ago was, in fact, possible. This is the start of a systemic change in the way we travel. ZOMORODI: So, Amy, you've watched the video. It's pretty fun to watch because it's Josh and a colleague, like, zipping around at whatever - 700 miles per hour with their cheeks, like, flapping in the wind. They look like they're on a roller coaster ride. Is this the start of a systemic change in the way we travel? I'm not so sure I want to travel like that. WEBB: (Laughter) Listen, I hope it is. I hope it's the start of systemic change. Why can't we be open to alternative options for the future? The real future of a hyperloop isn't necessarily people with their cheeks flapping in the wind, looking pretty uncomfortable, moving at speeds that are absolutely terrifying. This is the beginning, right? The very first plane that took flight, the very first car, the very first Sumerians who invented, millennia ago, a way to get around on a cart using horses - you know, these are technologies that - they evolve over longer periods of time. So I, for one, welcome our Hyperloop future, but it's going to take us some time to get there. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ZOMORODI: In a minute, more glimpses into the future with Amy Webb, including looking at a new kind of bra that could change health care for women. I'm Manoush Zomorodi, and you're listening to the TED Radio Hour from NPR. Stay with us. It's the TED Radio Hour from NPR. I'm Manoush Zomorodi. On the show today, A Glimpse Into the Future. We are talking to futurist Amy Webb about where science and technology are headed next, including some fascinating and unusual inventions from TED speakers. And one of the categories where Amy sees some of the most innovation is in health and wellness. WEBB: We're looking at sort of a vast constellation of things that range from devices that connect to our personal data - so that would be a smartwatch like a Fitbit or an Apple Watch - to the onslaught of wearable devices that are coming to market - smart glasses. ZOMORODI: Yeah. WEBB: You can buy a ring that has a digital assistant and a speaker and a microphone built in that you wear on your finger that let you know if you're getting enough oxygen, wristbands that detect your emotion, your stress, your exercise habits. There are smart yoga pants that you can wear that will reveal whether or not you're doing postures correctly during the poses. So it's just all of these different devices that are collecting our data, helping us understand ourselves better and, in some cases, connecting your body directly to your physician for remote patient monitoring. ZOMORODI: I mean, some of those sound really cool. The example that we have got in this health and wellness category is, again, an old technology updated for the digital age, something specifically for women. In 2021 engineer and entrepreneur Alicia Chong Rodriguez - she gave a talk about her invention, a smart bra for better heart health. And she started her talk by explaining that there is a big problem for women in health care right now because of the way that research is done. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)ALICIA CHONG RODRIGUEZ: Heart disease and stroke are the leading causes of death and disability worldwide, and for women, it is not only harder to recognize, diagnose and treat. But after a heart attack or a stroke, women also face higher mortality. There are about 44 million women living in the U. S. with heart disease, and the incidences for women under 65 are on the rise. So what's going on? The answer lies at the intersection of two areas - data and medical devices. When I was doing cardiovascular research at MIT, I had access to huge datasets. Realizing that women were one of the largest subgroups underrepresented was eye-opening. In fact, women were basically excluded from cardiovascular clinical trials until the NIH mandated inclusion in 1993. This is why existing technologies and therapies often fall short - because most of them have been designed using data primarily from male animals and men. And as artificial intelligence helps turbocharge digital health, there's a danger that algorithms mostly trained with male data and biases will actually perpetuate the problem. ZOMORODI: Amy, hearing Alicia explain the huge gap that exists in data about women's health simply because their data was not being collected - also, that data sounds really old. I mean, I guess I shouldn't be surprised, but I was. What was your reaction? WEBB: Well, I'm not surprised. This TED talk really resonated with me because I do a lot of long distance bike riding on the weekends. And, you know, you can buy a heart rate monitor to track your heart rate and all the metrics that you would want to be tracking. And those monitors are best when they are attached to your chest and basically, like, pretty close to your heart. For those of you who are women who wear sports bras, you know that that is impractical. The way that sports bras are designed, the way that these chest monitors are designed - they're just - they don't work together very well. They're uncomfortable. They move around. You know, these are devices that are clearly designed for men by men. So this is a tiny, small example of a way that, as a woman, I'm being left out. And I'm somebody who desperately wants to and knows how to mine and refine my own data. There's a biometric data divide. ZOMORODI: And it's not just women, right? I mean, I've heard of dermatologists who say that a lot of the data being collected is only on white skin and not Black skin. And therefore, new treatments are biased in some ways because not only do they not know how they work; they don't know if they work on different kinds of skin. WEBB: That's absolutely correct. And the trick here is that as we ask artificial intelligence AI systems to play a greater role in pattern recognition and precision medicine and rapid drug discovery, unfortunately, we are making, in some cases, life and death decisions based on a very narrow dataset. And that's something that should concern everybody. ZOMORODI: So let's go back to Alicia. Her solution to one of the problems is collecting the right data with something she calls the smart bra. Here's how it works. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)CHONG RODRIGUEZ: Our idea is to turn the everyday bra into an actual lifesaver. This is our augmented garment platform. It gives women the ability to continuously and remotely acquire physiological data. By wearing this bra, a woman can view insights and patterns and keep an automated journal in her phone, giving her a simple way to track symptoms and collect lifesaving data to share with her doctor for early detection and targeted management. It can even track the safety and efficacy of certain therapies. We've built medical-grade textile sensors that can adapt to multiple bra styles and sizes for continuous, reliable and repeatable data all around her torso and her heart. We can track heart rhythm, breathing, temperature, posture and movement. And by applying algorithms, we can use this data to decode symptoms, articulate arrhythmia triggers and generate personalized digital biomarkers. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)ZOMORODI: What do you think of this, Amy? What do you think of her promise that this is an easy way to collect a lot of data on a personal level, but also a collective level - right? - that if you get enough women wearing these bras, then we can start to create new data sets and really understand what is happening for women and their cardiovascular health? WEBB: Well, obviously, if you have better sources of data to start and you're able to use those data, then you're going to get better outcomes on the other side. This is the beginning of a different path. And I think that's important because, you know, we're moving into an era where algorithms are making more and more decisions about us and, in fact, optimizing our health for us on a daily basis. And we want to make sure that we're optimizing for everybody, which means we need bigger pools of data. We need more opportunities for people to contribute data. And importantly, we need trust. Because without trust and faith in the systems that are collecting, housing and protecting these data, you know, then we create more problems down the road. ZOMORODI: Yeah. I mean, that concerns me. Like, well, you're collecting pretty intimate data here. What are you going to do with it? Who's in charge of it? All of those things. But on the flip side, if you tell me that by wearing this, I am contributing to an anonymized set of information that could maybe get more funding for research into how to treat cardiovascular problems for women, like that's intriguing to me. I'm excited by that. WEBB: Yeah. But again, this comes down to trust. I can give you a. . . ZOMORODI: Right. WEBB: . . . Quick example of what happens when you misplace or abuse trust. So there's. . . ZOMORODI: Yeah. WEBB: . . . A tribe that has lived in what is now Arizona for centuries, the Havasupai tribe. This tribe has had some issues with diabetes over time, and so they allowed researchers from Arizona State University in to conduct a study in 1990. And the idea was to collect health data, learn and eventually help the tribe eradicate diabetes. But then, unbeknownst to the tribe, the researchers changed the scope of their project to encompass a lot more data; so genetic markers for alcoholism, for different disorders like schizophrenia. And the researchers went on to publish a whole bunch of papers in academic journals highlighting these results. And the articles resulted in news stories. And the news stories really reflected badly on this tribe. They were completely, understandably, horrified and humiliated, which led to the Navajo Nation, which was the second - or, I guess, is the second largest group of indigenous people in the United States, to ban all genetic sequencing, all analysis; basically, all related research on its members. And that makes sense, right? Because nobody wants to be exploited in that way. But that caused this other problem, which is that the pool of genetic data in the U. S. doesn't really include indigenous people. And, you know, there are similar stories that I could tell you about America's Black population, you know, about various populations in the United States. And this all goes back to trust. So I think it's a good idea that we have more, better data, but we also have to do so in a way that is traceable and accountable, and we have to be good custodians of people's personal private data. ZOMORODI: Yeah. We need to remember that when we - remember why some people are vaccine hesitant. From what I understand, Alicia hopes to bring her smart bra to the market, like, pretty soon, actually. What are some other personal health devices that you think are going to be out there pretty soon? WEBB: Well, I got to tell you, the thing that I'm looking forward to is a toilet. ZOMORODI: (Laughter). WEBB: So this is, like, a weird turn that we're about to take, but. . . ZOMORODI: Do it, Amy. WEBB: . . . Do it. So, like, in the 2010s, there was some research at Stanford University on a device that you would have in your home. So this is a smart toilet, which was outfitted with litmus strips and some pressure sensors and things. And the idea was to be able to more effectively monitor patients in living facilities, in their homes. Now, there's actually a lot of very valuable data that you can retrieve that you, let's say, leave behind, right? ZOMORODI: (Laughter). WEBB: So with one brief trip to the bathroom, we can tell a lot about you, like whether you have prostate inflammation or your blood sugar level is high or whether, you know, you've got certain inflammation in your gut. And these data tell a story about your gut health and about your overall health. The problem is that we tend not to collect those data unless there is something wrong, when we show up at a doctor's office. Wouldn't it be awesome if we were able to collect those data every day? I mean, can you imagine knowing what your gut flora baseline is the way that you know what your normal temperature is? ZOMORODI: Oh, I'm in. WEBB: Yeah. That would be incredibly useful, actionable information. And then, interestingly enough, earlier this year, Toto, which is a Japanese company famous for making toilets, debuted its own wellness toilet. And this is a toilet outfitted with sensors, collection tools, you know, basically all the type of technology that you really don't want recognizing you in that particular place, you know what I mean? ZOMORODI: So not only would it be like, wow, I should eat more sauerkraut, but also could it potentially - like, I'm thinking of last - when the pandemic began and people started - there was a collection from sewer systems and they started to be able to tell, you know, from fecal matter where there was about to be a coronavirus outbreak. Is that another way that this could be sort of collectively? WEBB: Yeah, totally. I mean, you could pool - two things with the beginnings of the outbreak. You know, a lot of men, men of a certain age, they get a lot of prostate infections, and a prostate infection, in some ways, mirrors the symptoms of COVID-19. You get all-over body aches. You run a fever. You feel kind of achy, right? And I would imagine at the beginning of the crisis, there were probably a lot of men out there who were at the beginning stages of a prostate infection worrying that they had COVID and also probably without the ability to easily get into a doctor's office to take a test. So a smart toilet would have alleviated, you know, some of that challenge - right? - because you would have known, oh, I've got a prostate infection. My toilet is going to connect to my local pharmacy and shoot over a prescription for Cipro, right? And that'll be that. And yeah, if we were able to anonymize and pull those data in a way that protected privacy, then yeah, we would probably have been able to track pockets of outbreak. In the future, we'll be able to track pockets of poor nutrition or areas where diabetes is starting to spike, and you'll be able to do a lot on a micro-community level. ZOMORODI: OK. I want to switch gears now, and I want to talk about something in a realm that has largely been devoid of technological innovation. The next speaker gave a talk in 2021. Her name is Karoli Hindriks. She's an entrepreneur, and her talk is called Why The Passport Needs An Upgrade. Karoli thinks they are cumbersome, bureaucratic, essentially logistical nightmares for people who live in the global economy. And, you know, this is not a problem that she thinks is new. She started thinking about the issues that come with passports while she was growing up in Estonia under Soviet occupation. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)KAROLI HINDRIKS: Having lived in that level of darkness made me wonder why are borders and movement between countries constructed the way they are? According to the World Economic Forum, human capital is the driving force for economic growth. So why are the barriers to global mobility so high? Why is the process so time-consuming, so dreadful and taunting, so very scary? And I know it's scary because I was detained at San Francisco Airport for two hours just to get on this stage. In 2020, the World Economic Forum reported that the top three countries where the highly educated migrants came from were India, China and Philippines, which, according to 2021 Henley Passport Index, ranked among the least travel-friendly passports in the world, ranking respectively 85th, 70th and 77th out of 110. The problem starts from what we call a passport. ZOMORODI: OK, so Karoli is wondering, why? If we need mobility to get human labor and capital to the places that need it, what is the point in making it so hard to do so? And the way that we currently track people is essentially based on nationality rather than the idea that people exist as part of an international, I guess, workforce is what she's saying. WEBB: Yeah, I mean, if you stop and think what is a passport really - right? - it's just a number that's tied to a database. And it represents us, I guess, in a way, but it doesn't do much more than that. And most of us now are global. You know, we work in different places. We move around to different places. And the value sometimes that we place on a person and therefore their ability to move around is very much hindered by wherever that passport came from. So she absolutely has a point. ZOMORODI: She gives another example of a highly skilled specialist from Yemen, a divorced single mother of two who's working for a Malaysian tech company. And the company wants to transfer her to their European office. But because she has a Yemeni passport, she has to fly thousands of miles back and forth multiple times, different embassies to get visas for her and her kids - I mean, clearly not good for her family, not good for the company, not good for the environment. So why does it continue to work this way if none of us like it? WEBB: Well, we tend to keep things in motion - right? - and we don't like to make huge or big changes. The passport was first introduced as a globally required travel document during World War I, just after Henry Ford introduced affordable automobiles. And today, our passports are still pretty much the same way that they were a century ago. I think there was a flaw in the way that the passport system was built. The modern passport system was designed by a Western-centric organization. ZOMORODI: Right. WEBB: And it became an object for people in Western countries, but it became a burden for others. ZOMORODI: When we come back, how Karoli wants to fix the passport problem and whether futurist Amy Webb thinks it will work. On the show today, A Glimpse Into the Future. I'm Manoush Zomorodi, and you're listening to the TED Radio Hour from NPR. We'll be right back. It's the TED Radio Hour from NPR. I'm Manoush Zomorodi. And on the show today, glimpses into the future. We are spending the hour with futurist Amy Webb, talking about innovations that could revolutionize how we live, interact and travel. Amy, we were just talking about how outmoded the paper passport is in a global economy. And we were hearing from entrepreneur Karoli Hindriks, who believes that digital passports are the answer. And she came to this by experience, by growing up in Estonia, a country which has put all of its citizens' information online. WEBB: Yeah. It's really difficult to overstate just what a quantum leap Estonia has made when it comes to digitalization. You know, from creating e-passports and electronic registry systems to even creating a system like a national registry for genetic data to make it easier to run experiments in a totally ethical way, you know, Estonia is just leaps and bounds ahead of most of the rest of the world when it comes to digitalization and creating decentralized systems that are fair and equitable and serve its citizens. Now, to be fair, Estonia is also a teeny, tiny country, very - you know, like, a few million people in north central Europe. So, you know, how that might scale in Western Europe or in a place like the United States is a little bit more complicated. But the story of Estonia and the story that she's telling is a fascinating example of an alternative future. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)HINDRIKS: One of the keys to Estonia's success in digitalization was the focus to build one digital identity for each individual that allows public and private databases to link up and operate in harmony. Estonia is going to do everything online other than get married or divorced. The digitalization saves Estonia a stack of paper as high as the Eiffel Tower every month. On top of that, the digital signature alone enables Estonia to save 2% of its GDP every year. That's a whole lot of money being wasted because public sectors are not adapting to existing technologies. We can tackle that by creating a secure, universal digital identity where all the users need to do is upload their data and documents such as passport, marriage and education certificates into our smart system, which then converts that data into pieces that can be matched to relevant government forms in different countries. The beauty of it is the once-only rule. The user needs to add that data once, as it is then stored for the future use. ZOMORODI: So what she means by universal identity is that all of our important information would exist online in a single system not controlled by any one country and eliminating the current bureaucracy of travel and working in other countries. But, Amy, Karoli kind of skims over the technology that would be needed to make this even possible. She refers to it as a smart system. What is that? WEBB: Right. So she's talking about - and please stay with me as I say this - the blockchain. ZOMORODI: Oh, that word, right? WEBB: I know. I know. It's horrible, right? But here's what's important. We're talking about something akin to, like, a huge, public spreadsheet where anybody can write information to it. And it's authenticated, and it's accurate, and it's anonymous. So you don't know whose stuff is what. But it also can't be erased or modified. And here's why this matters - because she's talking about forums. But this is not just about forms. You know, the average person has I don't know how many passwords and documents. Manoush, when I got married, I legally changed my last name to my husband's last name. ZOMORODI: Oh. WEBB: And I cannot begin - like, some ladies who are listening here know the apocalyptic horror of what it's like before and after you change your name. It's like I had to carry around a marriage certificate with me for a year because of, you know, trying to get on planes and, you know, waiting for this, like, cascade of correct documentation to arrive. It was horrible. I'm still me, right? I've just adopted a different last name. So what she's talking about here is making this easier so that the set of credentials that is you - that they're stored in a place, and they can't be altered. But they can be authenticated and used by a trusted third party. We already have sort of parts of this in existence today in the form of, you know, a credit card or a bank account, things like that. What she's talking about here is something much more bigger. It's much more comprehensive. And it's part of the blockchain. . . ZOMORODI: Yeah, yeah. WEBB: . . . Like a smart contract. ZOMORODI: I mean, there are lots of things still being worked out with blockchain, like who governs it, who authenticates it. But the case that I keep thinking about is my vaccine card because right now I have this little slip of paper from Walgreens that says I've been vaccinated. And here in New York, we have an app on our phones that shows our vaccination status, but that only works here in New York City. I went to California, and they were like, cool. Can I see your piece of paper? WEBB: Yep. ZOMORODI: Anyone can fake a little piece of paper. This - in a global pandemic, don't we need a global way of tracking vaccinations? WEBB: So something like a centralized digital ID solves a lot of these problems. And I will tell you that because the work that we do, you know, there's a lot of governments that are in progress on building singular digital identities. And I think the challenge going forward is we're going to have competing systems, which, I think, presents some new types of problems. ZOMORODI: So we're coming in for the finish here. Most of the innovations that we've discussed so far are in testing or prototype form. They're not necessarily available to the average person. But the last thing we're going to talk about - and there are going to be people who groan when I say this. . . WEBB: (Laughter). ZOMORODI: . . . And other people who say, wait, what? It's NFTs. That stands for non-fungible tokens. And this is a digital way of buying ephemeral things like artwork. Any of us can use them. And one believer in this new technology is Kayvon Tehranian. He's a technologist and entrepreneur. And his talk is called \"How NFTs Are Building The Internet Of The Future. \"(SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)KAYVON TEHRANIAN: We've uploaded trillions of photos and videos and even cat memes to the internet for free. And what business model has allowed this information to be free? Advertising. Advertising is the internet's default business model, not because that's what we want, but because that's what pays the bills. Right now, the few large corporations that run the most effective ad networks control most of the value on today's internet, not the people creating its content. On today's internet, we don't get paid for the work we do with our minds. And what's more, the content we upload to these services is trapped there. These services not only make money from our content, they control it - until NFTs. NFTs are a technological breakthrough. They offer us the opportunity to break away from that broken system. It's a certificate of ownership registered on the blockchain for everyone to see. It's not too dissimilar to the deed you get when you buy a house in the physical world. But instead of a house, an NFT denotes ownership of a file on the internet. ZOMORODI: OK. So let's say it again. NFTs stand for non-fungible tokens. Kayvon describes it like a deed to a house. But, I mean, is it really like a deed to a house? Amy, help me out. What is the right analogy here? And I think we need to use the word blockchain again. WEBB: (Laughter). ZOMORODI: Lord, help us. WEBB: All right. So non-fungible basically means that whatever it is is unique. You can't make another one, right? So a dollar bill is fungible because if you have one dollar bill, you could trade it in for another dollar bill and get the same value, unless there's extenuating circumstances like you've got an ultra-rare dollar bill or something. OK. Here's where this actually becomes practical. So if you've bought a super-expensive collectible item, like a fancy handbag, it comes with a certificate of authenticity. But there have been some problems with things that look real but aren't. Or paper certificates have a habit of getting lost. So let's say you get your physical, fancy handbag. But in addition to that, you also get a non-fungible token, which is sort of a registration that you yourself own this particular bag, right? Now, people could take snapshots of that handbag. They could sell those handbag pictures to other people. It doesn't preclude somebody else from sharing it. But legally, you own both the object and the rights or the certificate to it. Now, let's say that you've bought a digital collectible, like a super-rare baseball card or something that happens to be a digital versus a physical one, this is an asset. It's money at rest that you can hold that may accumulate value over time if somebody else wants to purchase it from you. ZOMORODI: And I guess it'll increase value. Like, let's say I post on my Instagram or my other social media and I'm like, look at this. This thing is cool. And lots of people are like, whoa, that digital baseball card is really beautiful. Lots of likes, lots of likes, lots of likes. So now if somebody else wants to buy it from me, the price goes up, potentially. WEBB: Right. Volatility is a piece of that story. And that's because this is a very emotionally driven area right now. People are throwing money at NFTs. They're throwing money at all different types of new, digital assets. And the values of these things are swinging wildly. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)TEHRANIAN: Let's take an example, Nyan Cat, a wildly popular, instantly recognizable cat meme. Since it was uploaded to the internet a decade ago, it has accumulated hundreds of millions of views. And precisely because of that virality, when it was auctioned as an NFT, it sold for 300 eth - or the equivalent of over $600,000. And the person who now owns this NFT, they're not preventing anyone from liking, resharing or remixing Nyan Cat. Nyan Cat is free to travel the internet as it always has. What's different now is that as Nyan Cat's popularity continues to grow, so can the value of the NFT. ZOMORODI: So the example that we heard was about Nyan Cat. I mean, who cares, Amy? WEBB: (Laughter). ZOMORODI: I'm sorry. But, like, what is the point? Why do NFTs matter? WEBB: Well, I also don't care. But here - at least about the cat. ZOMORODI: (Laughter). WEBB: But we need to update our systems, you know, whether that's how artists get compensated for their work as their work scales, or how we shop for things and how we sell things. You know, a lot of our current systems were created in the days before the internet, before, with a simple click of a button, you could mint an infinite number of copies of things. And if you're an artist and your work is suddenly shared infinite ways, you know, that work loses value. So what we're talking about here is something called provenance. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)WEBB: And that's being able to prove the origin of whatever it might be - whether it's a TED Talk or a digital copy of a fancy handbag - and making sure that the people who should be compensated are fairly compensated and that the records associated with whatever it is are also very clear and available, you know, to bring better transparency to the systems that we have. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)TEHRANIAN: Because of NFTs, Chris Torres, Nyan Cat's creator, has received direct compensation for his creation. But what's more is he'll continue to receive compensation every single time the NFT is resold. This is because of the royalty system baked into the smart contracts that govern NFTs. NFTs are software. They can be programmed. And with something as complicated as royalties, which require enormous amounts of legal and manual labor to implement in our analog world, we can now express them in a few simple lines of code. This represents a breakthrough innovation for any industry predicated on royalty payments, such as publishing or music. And just as blogs and MP3s re-architected these industries in decades past, NFTs will catalyze their next evolution. The internet dissolved our geographic boundaries. NFTs dissolve economic boundaries. ZOMORODI: OK, so those are some big promises, especially for a technology that many people think is just a fad, maybe even a scam, a way to get rich. I mean, Amy, there is a lot of fraud out there when it comes to cryptocurrencies, blockchain projects. But there are also a lot of believers. Is that just how innovation works - you get the dark side with the early adopters? WEBB: So again, with everything, you know, this is the beginning of a transformation. And the trick here is to figure out what's trendy versus what's the trend, right? As a futurist, there are some rules that I use to sort of figure this out, and that represents a long-term movement into the future. You know, is an NFT meeting sort of basic human needs, and is this catalyzed by new technology? Yes, probably. Is it timely and going to persist over a long period of time? The NFT itself - probably not. But what it represents - and blockchain, that's probably here to stay. And finally, is this likely to evolve as it emerges? Because the long-term trends that matter tend not to be static. So, you know, we think about NFT and art and collectibles. That's trendy. The real trend is evolving from our current systems, from our current ways to authenticate people and the way that we're doing contracts, to more modern systems that represent the world as it is today. And that implies new types of authorities, new types of contracts, new types of authentication. It also probably means we're looking at a whole bunch of new types of cybercrime, right? Because any time you get a technology that's helpful, people find harmful uses for it. ZOMORODI: OK. So I think that brings me to my last question. A big part of your job, which you described earlier, is advising governments and corporations on the state of innovation. But, Amy, just remind us - like, why should we care about all this stuff? Why should we pay attention? Because it does sometimes feel like these topics - NFTs, blockchain, smart technology - they're kind of removed from our day-to-day lives. And some of them won't necessarily be ready for years to come, but I find it really exciting. So I'm just kind of curious about what you think. WEBB: The problem is that these are tricky subjects, and sometimes they really feel inaccessible. And I know that we all have - I'm a - you know, I think you and I are both very busy parents. The last thing I want to do at the end of a workday and dealing with homework and cooking dinner and everything else is, like - now I'm supposed to have any brainpower left to, like, talk about blockchain? Are you crazy? (LAUGHTER)WEBB: That is not what I want to do right now. I want to tuck in and, like - I want to go read a book or watch \"The Real Housewives. \"ZOMORODI: Yes. WEBB: For real, that's like - you know. But we can't close our eyes and sleep through this great awakening that's happening around us because we have fundamental technologies coming online that are going to reshape what the rest of humanity looks like. So I totally get it, but I also really care about our futures. And we all have a stake in it. ZOMORODI: That's Amy Webb. She's the founder and CEO of the Future Today Institute. Her new book is called \"The Genesis Machine: Our Quest To Rewrite Life In The Age Of Synthetic Biology. \" You can see her TED Talk and all the talks that we discussed at TED. com.

I'm Manoush Zomorodi, and you've been listening to the TED Radio Hour from NPR. MANOUSH ZOMORODI, HOST:   It's the TED Radio Hour from NPR. I'm Manoush Zomorodi. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ZOMORODI: And ask anyone to predict the future these days, they will likely decline. (SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE) ANTHONY FAUCI: You know, I'm not going to speculate on that. I want to see what happens right now. ANTHONY MASON: No one can forecast exactly how 2021 will unfold. ELON MUSK: Well, I think this is one of those things that's quite difficult to predict. FAUCI: We just can't predict that. We don't know. ZOMORODI: For many of us, the world feels erratic, volatile. Trying to guess what will happen next seems futile unless you're Amy Webb. AMY WEBB: I'm Amy Webb. I am the CEO of the Future Today Institute and a professor of strategic foresight at the NYU Stern School of Business. ZOMORODI: And, Amy, is it fair to say you're a futurist? WEBB: I am. I'm a quantitative futurist. ZOMORODI: Coolest job title, but can you explain what a quantitative futurist is? Do you see, like - I don't know - spreadsheets in your crystal ball? WEBB: So futurists do not make predictions. Instead, we collect signal data. We model those data, looking for patterns and try to anticipate many plausible futures. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ZOMORODI: Big corporations and governments use Amy's projections to prepare for all kinds of scenarios, including pandemics. WEBB: The type of work that we do results in very big bets, you know, sometimes involving billions or multiple billions of dollars that chief executives and their teams have to place. And we want to make sure that they're prepared. ZOMORODI: But Amy says her research into scientific innovation and technology trends, well, more just regular people need to know about them as well. WEBB: Manoush, like you, I'm a regular person, too. And. . . (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) WEBB: . . . Here's the plight of the regular person. The problem is that we're living through this great transformation. And every one of us who's living today, we're going to have to start making some really difficult choices that impact how we spend our time and what we want our kids to do and the people that we vote for. You know, these are going to be complex decisions. And the good news is that on the horizon, there's a lot of opportunity for, you know, personal growth, for economic growth. But that opportunity comes with some serious associated risks. ZOMORODI: So today on the show, Amy Webb talks us through four categories of innovation and explains how these inventions and ideas could upend the future of travel, wellness and what we value in the world. Amy has actually been on the show before talking about her memoir and TED Talk - both called \"Data, A Love Story\" - about how she hacked an online dating platform. But today, she is back to give us A Glimpse Into the Future. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ZOMORODI: OK. So Amy, you have generously agreed to return to the show. But we are going to do something completely different. You are going to guide us through a selection of TED Talks about some of the big trends in technology. But they're very specific innovations. And you're going to help us put these innovations into context, break down the hype from the real change that could stem from them, and help us understand the impact that they might have on the way that the internet and our lives work. So lots to talk about. WEBB: It'll be fun. ZOMORODI: And I want to start with a category that truly does affect us all, transportation. We can't teleport yet, Amy, but we still need to move our bodies from point A to point B. And this first speaker thinks that one way we will do that is with something called the hyperloop. Josh Giegel is the CEO and co-founder of the Virgin Hyperloop. His 2021 talk is called \"Super Speed, Magnetic Levitation And The Vision Behind The Hyperloop. \" And if you've never heard of the hyperloop - I had not - here is how he describes it. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) JOSH GIEGEL: So hyperloop is a transit system that has a vehicle called a pod inside of a tube about the same size as a subway tunnel, where we suck most but not all of the air out of it - be the equivalent of flying at about 200,000 feet of altitude. This allows us to glide at airline speeds without turbulence for a fraction of the energy consumption - about one-tenth, to be precise, of an aircraft. And that's important because we, as humans, have an innate need for speed. But this obsession with speed and volume is destroying the planet around us. In fact, in the United States, the transportation industry is the single largest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. A hyperloop system can begin to change this trend before the end of the decade by transforming short haul journeys and commutes from hours to minutes. ZOMORODI: OK. This sounds amazing. I'm levitating. I'm getting sucked through a kind of more efficient subway tunnel, essentially, but going as fast as a plane, using one-tenth of the energy that airline travel uses. Amy, tell us more about how it actually works. WEBB: Yeah. OK. So do you remember pneumatic tubes at banks? You put your money in that little canister thing. And then it gets sucked up and delivered to the teller on the inside of the building. So this is not entirely how hyperloop works. But, you know, it gives you at least a visual. ZOMORODI: Yeah. WEBB: So imagine being inside of a very comfortable pod, a closed container, that's capable of traveling, you know, at very, very fast speeds. So if you've ever been at the bank drive-through and you've seen what that tube looks like and how fast things are going, it's kind of the same thing. So we're talking about sort of a pod that is hovering inside of a vacuum tube. And using electric propulsion, it can accelerate gradually, pick up speed and then really take off. And the pods are able to glide along the track using magnetic levitation, which is actually already in use in some train systems, just in a different way around the world - so, like, maglev trains in Japan and China, for example. ZOMORODI: So is it kind of like a subway? Like, would there be stops along the way? What kind of travel or commute would the Hyperloop be best suited for? WEBB: Well, you know, a lot of these plans project speeds of between 700 and 800 miles an hour. ZOMORODI: Holy moly. WEBB: So that's pretty fast. So by the time you get one of these things up to speed, you know, you're not going to want to make a stop every couple of blocks. So instead, this would be more of an equivalent of a - like, a round trip between San Francisco and Los Angeles, which would normally take 12 hours on the road but being able to do it in just one hour. ZOMORODI: It's interesting to me that, like, what you're describing sounds really futuristic. But Josh Giegel says the idea of a hyperloop has actually been around for a while. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) GIEGEL: And 118 years ago, before the Wright brothers' first flight, the thought of humans flying was inconceivable. It was crazy, even. Yet today, we get into a plane 30,000 feet above the ground and think nothing of it. A year after the Wright brothers' historic first flight, another inventor, an American physicist named Robert Goddard, proposed an entirely new form of transportation - the vactrain. He envisioned a high-speed mass transit system where people would travel on the ground, with little to no air resistance, inside of a tube. And today, these renderings of some of the earliest renderings what we call a hyperloop. ZOMORODI: (Laughter) The vactrain. OK, so we've been thinking about zipping our bodies around the Earth for decades. But I got to say, Amy, the newest mode of transport that I have taken recently is, like, a motorized scooter. Have we kind of been at a lull when it comes to innovating transportation? I'm not ready to sign up for Jeff Bezos's visit to the outer edge of the atmosphere. I just want to get places on the planet. And, you know, I feel like we've heard a lot about making all our cars electric, but that's not terribly futuristic. So where are we when it comes to innovating in transportation? WEBB: You know, historically, when we think about the future of transportation, we tend to think of things in the air, not things above the ground slightly or even under the ground. And, you know, we tend to reference \"The Jetsons. \" ZOMORODI: Right. WEBB: Now, when we think about transportation and the future, we tend to reference \"The Jetsons\" because of that scene with the flying car at the beginning, right? ZOMORODI: Right. Yes. WEBB: And, you know - and even if you haven't watched an episode of \"The Jetsons,\" if somebody says Jetsons car, everybody immediately knows what you mean. But here's what's interesting. It was 1917 when a guy named Glenn Curtiss filed a patent for an autoplane (ph), and it was a car with some wings attached to it. So it hopped in the air kind of a few times, and it never really, really flew. But every decade since then, there have been multiple flying car patents and actual flying cars that got designed. ZOMORODI: Wow. WEBB: So the question is, why are we stuck in this vicious cycle of the future of transportation being a thing we already have that happens to be up in the air that doesn't really solve any problems? ZOMORODI: And I - just to get back to the Hyperloop. The - not only have the plans been drawn up, but I was intrigued to hear that the - that they're testing it now with, like, real humans in it, including Josh Giegel himself. Its first ride with real passengers was in November of 2020, and here's him describing what happened. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) GIEGEL: We've created a test track in the deserts outside of Las Vegas. We've operated the system over 500 times and had countless other tests on our subsystems. So by October of 2020, we had run hundreds of tests. We had an independent safety auditor give us the green light, but still, it was nerve-wracking. And on November 8, 2020, we made our first attempt. So at our test site, my colleague Sara and I climbed into that can-like vehicle, suspended by magnetic levitation, at a near-vacuum environment, and the countdown began. In those 15 seconds, we showed the world that what was deemed ludicrous over a hundred years ago was, in fact, possible. This is the start of a systemic change in the way we travel. ZOMORODI: So, Amy, you've watched the video. It's pretty fun to watch because it's Josh and a colleague, like, zipping around at whatever - 700 miles per hour with their cheeks, like, flapping in the wind. They look like they're on a roller coaster ride. Is this the start of a systemic change in the way we travel? I'm not so sure I want to travel like that. WEBB: (Laughter) Listen, I hope it is. I hope it's the start of systemic change. Why can't we be open to alternative options for the future? The real future of a hyperloop isn't necessarily people with their cheeks flapping in the wind, looking pretty uncomfortable, moving at speeds that are absolutely terrifying. This is the beginning, right? The very first plane that took flight, the very first car, the very first Sumerians who invented, millennia ago, a way to get around on a cart using horses - you know, these are technologies that - they evolve over longer periods of time. So I, for one, welcome our Hyperloop future, but it's going to take us some time to get there. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ZOMORODI: In a minute, more glimpses into the future with Amy Webb, including looking at a new kind of bra that could change health care for women. I'm Manoush Zomorodi, and you're listening to the TED Radio Hour from NPR. Stay with us. It's the TED Radio Hour from NPR. I'm Manoush Zomorodi. On the show today, A Glimpse Into the Future. We are talking to futurist Amy Webb about where science and technology are headed next, including some fascinating and unusual inventions from TED speakers. And one of the categories where Amy sees some of the most innovation is in health and wellness. WEBB: We're looking at sort of a vast constellation of things that range from devices that connect to our personal data - so that would be a smartwatch like a Fitbit or an Apple Watch - to the onslaught of wearable devices that are coming to market - smart glasses. ZOMORODI: Yeah. WEBB: You can buy a ring that has a digital assistant and a speaker and a microphone built in that you wear on your finger that let you know if you're getting enough oxygen, wristbands that detect your emotion, your stress, your exercise habits. There are smart yoga pants that you can wear that will reveal whether or not you're doing postures correctly during the poses. So it's just all of these different devices that are collecting our data, helping us understand ourselves better and, in some cases, connecting your body directly to your physician for remote patient monitoring. ZOMORODI: I mean, some of those sound really cool. The example that we have got in this health and wellness category is, again, an old technology updated for the digital age, something specifically for women. In 2021 engineer and entrepreneur Alicia Chong Rodriguez - she gave a talk about her invention, a smart bra for better heart health. And she started her talk by explaining that there is a big problem for women in health care right now because of the way that research is done. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) ALICIA CHONG RODRIGUEZ: Heart disease and stroke are the leading causes of death and disability worldwide, and for women, it is not only harder to recognize, diagnose and treat. But after a heart attack or a stroke, women also face higher mortality. There are about 44 million women living in the U. S. with heart disease, and the incidences for women under 65 are on the rise. So what's going on? The answer lies at the intersection of two areas - data and medical devices. When I was doing cardiovascular research at MIT, I had access to huge datasets. Realizing that women were one of the largest subgroups underrepresented was eye-opening. In fact, women were basically excluded from cardiovascular clinical trials until the NIH mandated inclusion in 1993. This is why existing technologies and therapies often fall short - because most of them have been designed using data primarily from male animals and men. And as artificial intelligence helps turbocharge digital health, there's a danger that algorithms mostly trained with male data and biases will actually perpetuate the problem. ZOMORODI: Amy, hearing Alicia explain the huge gap that exists in data about women's health simply because their data was not being collected - also, that data sounds really old. I mean, I guess I shouldn't be surprised, but I was. What was your reaction? WEBB: Well, I'm not surprised. This TED talk really resonated with me because I do a lot of long distance bike riding on the weekends. And, you know, you can buy a heart rate monitor to track your heart rate and all the metrics that you would want to be tracking. And those monitors are best when they are attached to your chest and basically, like, pretty close to your heart. For those of you who are women who wear sports bras, you know that that is impractical. The way that sports bras are designed, the way that these chest monitors are designed - they're just - they don't work together very well. They're uncomfortable. They move around. You know, these are devices that are clearly designed for men by men. So this is a tiny, small example of a way that, as a woman, I'm being left out. And I'm somebody who desperately wants to and knows how to mine and refine my own data. There's a biometric data divide. ZOMORODI: And it's not just women, right? I mean, I've heard of dermatologists who say that a lot of the data being collected is only on white skin and not Black skin. And therefore, new treatments are biased in some ways because not only do they not know how they work; they don't know if they work on different kinds of skin. WEBB: That's absolutely correct. And the trick here is that as we ask artificial intelligence AI systems to play a greater role in pattern recognition and precision medicine and rapid drug discovery, unfortunately, we are making, in some cases, life and death decisions based on a very narrow dataset. And that's something that should concern everybody. ZOMORODI: So let's go back to Alicia. Her solution to one of the problems is collecting the right data with something she calls the smart bra. Here's how it works. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) CHONG RODRIGUEZ: Our idea is to turn the everyday bra into an actual lifesaver. This is our augmented garment platform. It gives women the ability to continuously and remotely acquire physiological data. By wearing this bra, a woman can view insights and patterns and keep an automated journal in her phone, giving her a simple way to track symptoms and collect lifesaving data to share with her doctor for early detection and targeted management. It can even track the safety and efficacy of certain therapies. We've built medical-grade textile sensors that can adapt to multiple bra styles and sizes for continuous, reliable and repeatable data all around her torso and her heart. We can track heart rhythm, breathing, temperature, posture and movement. And by applying algorithms, we can use this data to decode symptoms, articulate arrhythmia triggers and generate personalized digital biomarkers. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ZOMORODI: What do you think of this, Amy? What do you think of her promise that this is an easy way to collect a lot of data on a personal level, but also a collective level - right? - that if you get enough women wearing these bras, then we can start to create new data sets and really understand what is happening for women and their cardiovascular health? WEBB: Well, obviously, if you have better sources of data to start and you're able to use those data, then you're going to get better outcomes on the other side. This is the beginning of a different path. And I think that's important because, you know, we're moving into an era where algorithms are making more and more decisions about us and, in fact, optimizing our health for us on a daily basis. And we want to make sure that we're optimizing for everybody, which means we need bigger pools of data. We need more opportunities for people to contribute data. And importantly, we need trust. Because without trust and faith in the systems that are collecting, housing and protecting these data, you know, then we create more problems down the road. ZOMORODI: Yeah. I mean, that concerns me. Like, well, you're collecting pretty intimate data here. What are you going to do with it? Who's in charge of it? All of those things. But on the flip side, if you tell me that by wearing this, I am contributing to an anonymized set of information that could maybe get more funding for research into how to treat cardiovascular problems for women, like that's intriguing to me. I'm excited by that. WEBB: Yeah. But again, this comes down to trust. I can give you a. . . ZOMORODI: Right. WEBB: . . . Quick example of what happens when you misplace or abuse trust. So there's. . . ZOMORODI: Yeah. WEBB: . . . A tribe that has lived in what is now Arizona for centuries, the Havasupai tribe. This tribe has had some issues with diabetes over time, and so they allowed researchers from Arizona State University in to conduct a study in 1990. And the idea was to collect health data, learn and eventually help the tribe eradicate diabetes. But then, unbeknownst to the tribe, the researchers changed the scope of their project to encompass a lot more data; so genetic markers for alcoholism, for different disorders like schizophrenia. And the researchers went on to publish a whole bunch of papers in academic journals highlighting these results. And the articles resulted in news stories. And the news stories really reflected badly on this tribe. They were completely, understandably, horrified and humiliated, which led to the Navajo Nation, which was the second - or, I guess, is the second largest group of indigenous people in the United States, to ban all genetic sequencing, all analysis; basically, all related research on its members. And that makes sense, right? Because nobody wants to be exploited in that way. But that caused this other problem, which is that the pool of genetic data in the U. S. doesn't really include indigenous people. And, you know, there are similar stories that I could tell you about America's Black population, you know, about various populations in the United States. And this all goes back to trust. So I think it's a good idea that we have more, better data, but we also have to do so in a way that is traceable and accountable, and we have to be good custodians of people's personal private data. ZOMORODI: Yeah. We need to remember that when we - remember why some people are vaccine hesitant. From what I understand, Alicia hopes to bring her smart bra to the market, like, pretty soon, actually. What are some other personal health devices that you think are going to be out there pretty soon? WEBB: Well, I got to tell you, the thing that I'm looking forward to is a toilet. ZOMORODI: (Laughter). WEBB: So this is, like, a weird turn that we're about to take, but. . . ZOMORODI: Do it, Amy. WEBB: . . . Do it. So, like, in the 2010s, there was some research at Stanford University on a device that you would have in your home. So this is a smart toilet, which was outfitted with litmus strips and some pressure sensors and things. And the idea was to be able to more effectively monitor patients in living facilities, in their homes. Now, there's actually a lot of very valuable data that you can retrieve that you, let's say, leave behind, right? ZOMORODI: (Laughter). WEBB: So with one brief trip to the bathroom, we can tell a lot about you, like whether you have prostate inflammation or your blood sugar level is high or whether, you know, you've got certain inflammation in your gut. And these data tell a story about your gut health and about your overall health. The problem is that we tend not to collect those data unless there is something wrong, when we show up at a doctor's office. Wouldn't it be awesome if we were able to collect those data every day? I mean, can you imagine knowing what your gut flora baseline is the way that you know what your normal temperature is? ZOMORODI: Oh, I'm in. WEBB: Yeah. That would be incredibly useful, actionable information. And then, interestingly enough, earlier this year, Toto, which is a Japanese company famous for making toilets, debuted its own wellness toilet. And this is a toilet outfitted with sensors, collection tools, you know, basically all the type of technology that you really don't want recognizing you in that particular place, you know what I mean? ZOMORODI: So not only would it be like, wow, I should eat more sauerkraut, but also could it potentially - like, I'm thinking of last - when the pandemic began and people started - there was a collection from sewer systems and they started to be able to tell, you know, from fecal matter where there was about to be a coronavirus outbreak. Is that another way that this could be sort of collectively? WEBB: Yeah, totally. I mean, you could pool - two things with the beginnings of the outbreak. You know, a lot of men, men of a certain age, they get a lot of prostate infections, and a prostate infection, in some ways, mirrors the symptoms of COVID-19. You get all-over body aches. You run a fever. You feel kind of achy, right? And I would imagine at the beginning of the crisis, there were probably a lot of men out there who were at the beginning stages of a prostate infection worrying that they had COVID and also probably without the ability to easily get into a doctor's office to take a test. So a smart toilet would have alleviated, you know, some of that challenge - right? - because you would have known, oh, I've got a prostate infection. My toilet is going to connect to my local pharmacy and shoot over a prescription for Cipro, right? And that'll be that. And yeah, if we were able to anonymize and pull those data in a way that protected privacy, then yeah, we would probably have been able to track pockets of outbreak. In the future, we'll be able to track pockets of poor nutrition or areas where diabetes is starting to spike, and you'll be able to do a lot on a micro-community level. ZOMORODI: OK. I want to switch gears now, and I want to talk about something in a realm that has largely been devoid of technological innovation. The next speaker gave a talk in 2021. Her name is Karoli Hindriks. She's an entrepreneur, and her talk is called Why The Passport Needs An Upgrade. Karoli thinks they are cumbersome, bureaucratic, essentially logistical nightmares for people who live in the global economy. And, you know, this is not a problem that she thinks is new. She started thinking about the issues that come with passports while she was growing up in Estonia under Soviet occupation. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) KAROLI HINDRIKS: Having lived in that level of darkness made me wonder why are borders and movement between countries constructed the way they are? According to the World Economic Forum, human capital is the driving force for economic growth. So why are the barriers to global mobility so high? Why is the process so time-consuming, so dreadful and taunting, so very scary? And I know it's scary because I was detained at San Francisco Airport for two hours just to get on this stage. In 2020, the World Economic Forum reported that the top three countries where the highly educated migrants came from were India, China and Philippines, which, according to 2021 Henley Passport Index, ranked among the least travel-friendly passports in the world, ranking respectively 85th, 70th and 77th out of 110. The problem starts from what we call a passport. ZOMORODI: OK, so Karoli is wondering, why? If we need mobility to get human labor and capital to the places that need it, what is the point in making it so hard to do so? And the way that we currently track people is essentially based on nationality rather than the idea that people exist as part of an international, I guess, workforce is what she's saying. WEBB: Yeah, I mean, if you stop and think what is a passport really - right? - it's just a number that's tied to a database. And it represents us, I guess, in a way, but it doesn't do much more than that. And most of us now are global. You know, we work in different places. We move around to different places. And the value sometimes that we place on a person and therefore their ability to move around is very much hindered by wherever that passport came from. So she absolutely has a point. ZOMORODI: She gives another example of a highly skilled specialist from Yemen, a divorced single mother of two who's working for a Malaysian tech company. And the company wants to transfer her to their European office. But because she has a Yemeni passport, she has to fly thousands of miles back and forth multiple times, different embassies to get visas for her and her kids - I mean, clearly not good for her family, not good for the company, not good for the environment. So why does it continue to work this way if none of us like it? WEBB: Well, we tend to keep things in motion - right? - and we don't like to make huge or big changes. The passport was first introduced as a globally required travel document during World War I, just after Henry Ford introduced affordable automobiles. And today, our passports are still pretty much the same way that they were a century ago. I think there was a flaw in the way that the passport system was built. The modern passport system was designed by a Western-centric organization. ZOMORODI: Right. WEBB: And it became an object for people in Western countries, but it became a burden for others. ZOMORODI: When we come back, how Karoli wants to fix the passport problem and whether futurist Amy Webb thinks it will work. On the show today, A Glimpse Into the Future. I'm Manoush Zomorodi, and you're listening to the TED Radio Hour from NPR. We'll be right back. It's the TED Radio Hour from NPR. I'm Manoush Zomorodi. And on the show today, glimpses into the future. We are spending the hour with futurist Amy Webb, talking about innovations that could revolutionize how we live, interact and travel. Amy, we were just talking about how outmoded the paper passport is in a global economy. And we were hearing from entrepreneur Karoli Hindriks, who believes that digital passports are the answer. And she came to this by experience, by growing up in Estonia, a country which has put all of its citizens' information online. WEBB: Yeah. It's really difficult to overstate just what a quantum leap Estonia has made when it comes to digitalization. You know, from creating e-passports and electronic registry systems to even creating a system like a national registry for genetic data to make it easier to run experiments in a totally ethical way, you know, Estonia is just leaps and bounds ahead of most of the rest of the world when it comes to digitalization and creating decentralized systems that are fair and equitable and serve its citizens. Now, to be fair, Estonia is also a teeny, tiny country, very - you know, like, a few million people in north central Europe. So, you know, how that might scale in Western Europe or in a place like the United States is a little bit more complicated. But the story of Estonia and the story that she's telling is a fascinating example of an alternative future. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) HINDRIKS: One of the keys to Estonia's success in digitalization was the focus to build one digital identity for each individual that allows public and private databases to link up and operate in harmony. Estonia is going to do everything online other than get married or divorced. The digitalization saves Estonia a stack of paper as high as the Eiffel Tower every month. On top of that, the digital signature alone enables Estonia to save 2% of its GDP every year. That's a whole lot of money being wasted because public sectors are not adapting to existing technologies. We can tackle that by creating a secure, universal digital identity where all the users need to do is upload their data and documents such as passport, marriage and education certificates into our smart system, which then converts that data into pieces that can be matched to relevant government forms in different countries. The beauty of it is the once-only rule. The user needs to add that data once, as it is then stored for the future use. ZOMORODI: So what she means by universal identity is that all of our important information would exist online in a single system not controlled by any one country and eliminating the current bureaucracy of travel and working in other countries. But, Amy, Karoli kind of skims over the technology that would be needed to make this even possible. She refers to it as a smart system. What is that? WEBB: Right. So she's talking about - and please stay with me as I say this - the blockchain. ZOMORODI: Oh, that word, right? WEBB: I know. I know. It's horrible, right? But here's what's important. We're talking about something akin to, like, a huge, public spreadsheet where anybody can write information to it. And it's authenticated, and it's accurate, and it's anonymous. So you don't know whose stuff is what. But it also can't be erased or modified. And here's why this matters - because she's talking about forums. But this is not just about forms. You know, the average person has I don't know how many passwords and documents. Manoush, when I got married, I legally changed my last name to my husband's last name. ZOMORODI: Oh. WEBB: And I cannot begin - like, some ladies who are listening here know the apocalyptic horror of what it's like before and after you change your name. It's like I had to carry around a marriage certificate with me for a year because of, you know, trying to get on planes and, you know, waiting for this, like, cascade of correct documentation to arrive. It was horrible. I'm still me, right? I've just adopted a different last name. So what she's talking about here is making this easier so that the set of credentials that is you - that they're stored in a place, and they can't be altered. But they can be authenticated and used by a trusted third party. We already have sort of parts of this in existence today in the form of, you know, a credit card or a bank account, things like that. What she's talking about here is something much more bigger. It's much more comprehensive. And it's part of the blockchain. . . ZOMORODI: Yeah, yeah. WEBB: . . . Like a smart contract. ZOMORODI: I mean, there are lots of things still being worked out with blockchain, like who governs it, who authenticates it. But the case that I keep thinking about is my vaccine card because right now I have this little slip of paper from Walgreens that says I've been vaccinated. And here in New York, we have an app on our phones that shows our vaccination status, but that only works here in New York City. I went to California, and they were like, cool. Can I see your piece of paper? WEBB: Yep. ZOMORODI: Anyone can fake a little piece of paper. This - in a global pandemic, don't we need a global way of tracking vaccinations? WEBB: So something like a centralized digital ID solves a lot of these problems. And I will tell you that because the work that we do, you know, there's a lot of governments that are in progress on building singular digital identities. And I think the challenge going forward is we're going to have competing systems, which, I think, presents some new types of problems. ZOMORODI: So we're coming in for the finish here. Most of the innovations that we've discussed so far are in testing or prototype form. They're not necessarily available to the average person. But the last thing we're going to talk about - and there are going to be people who groan when I say this. . . WEBB: (Laughter). ZOMORODI: . . . And other people who say, wait, what? It's NFTs. That stands for non-fungible tokens. And this is a digital way of buying ephemeral things like artwork. Any of us can use them. And one believer in this new technology is Kayvon Tehranian. He's a technologist and entrepreneur. And his talk is called \"How NFTs Are Building The Internet Of The Future. \" (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) KAYVON TEHRANIAN: We've uploaded trillions of photos and videos and even cat memes to the internet for free. And what business model has allowed this information to be free? Advertising. Advertising is the internet's default business model, not because that's what we want, but because that's what pays the bills. Right now, the few large corporations that run the most effective ad networks control most of the value on today's internet, not the people creating its content. On today's internet, we don't get paid for the work we do with our minds. And what's more, the content we upload to these services is trapped there. These services not only make money from our content, they control it - until NFTs. NFTs are a technological breakthrough. They offer us the opportunity to break away from that broken system. It's a certificate of ownership registered on the blockchain for everyone to see. It's not too dissimilar to the deed you get when you buy a house in the physical world. But instead of a house, an NFT denotes ownership of a file on the internet. ZOMORODI: OK. So let's say it again. NFTs stand for non-fungible tokens. Kayvon describes it like a deed to a house. But, I mean, is it really like a deed to a house? Amy, help me out. What is the right analogy here? And I think we need to use the word blockchain again. WEBB: (Laughter). ZOMORODI: Lord, help us. WEBB: All right. So non-fungible basically means that whatever it is is unique. You can't make another one, right? So a dollar bill is fungible because if you have one dollar bill, you could trade it in for another dollar bill and get the same value, unless there's extenuating circumstances like you've got an ultra-rare dollar bill or something. OK. Here's where this actually becomes practical. So if you've bought a super-expensive collectible item, like a fancy handbag, it comes with a certificate of authenticity. But there have been some problems with things that look real but aren't. Or paper certificates have a habit of getting lost. So let's say you get your physical, fancy handbag. But in addition to that, you also get a non-fungible token, which is sort of a registration that you yourself own this particular bag, right? Now, people could take snapshots of that handbag. They could sell those handbag pictures to other people. It doesn't preclude somebody else from sharing it. But legally, you own both the object and the rights or the certificate to it. Now, let's say that you've bought a digital collectible, like a super-rare baseball card or something that happens to be a digital versus a physical one, this is an asset. It's money at rest that you can hold that may accumulate value over time if somebody else wants to purchase it from you. ZOMORODI: And I guess it'll increase value. Like, let's say I post on my Instagram or my other social media and I'm like, look at this. This thing is cool. And lots of people are like, whoa, that digital baseball card is really beautiful. Lots of likes, lots of likes, lots of likes. So now if somebody else wants to buy it from me, the price goes up, potentially. WEBB: Right. Volatility is a piece of that story. And that's because this is a very emotionally driven area right now. People are throwing money at NFTs. They're throwing money at all different types of new, digital assets. And the values of these things are swinging wildly. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) TEHRANIAN: Let's take an example, Nyan Cat, a wildly popular, instantly recognizable cat meme. Since it was uploaded to the internet a decade ago, it has accumulated hundreds of millions of views. And precisely because of that virality, when it was auctioned as an NFT, it sold for 300 eth - or the equivalent of over $600,000. And the person who now owns this NFT, they're not preventing anyone from liking, resharing or remixing Nyan Cat. Nyan Cat is free to travel the internet as it always has. What's different now is that as Nyan Cat's popularity continues to grow, so can the value of the NFT. ZOMORODI: So the example that we heard was about Nyan Cat. I mean, who cares, Amy? WEBB: (Laughter). ZOMORODI: I'm sorry. But, like, what is the point? Why do NFTs matter? WEBB: Well, I also don't care. But here - at least about the cat. ZOMORODI: (Laughter). WEBB: But we need to update our systems, you know, whether that's how artists get compensated for their work as their work scales, or how we shop for things and how we sell things. You know, a lot of our current systems were created in the days before the internet, before, with a simple click of a button, you could mint an infinite number of copies of things. And if you're an artist and your work is suddenly shared infinite ways, you know, that work loses value. So what we're talking about here is something called provenance. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) WEBB: And that's being able to prove the origin of whatever it might be - whether it's a TED Talk or a digital copy of a fancy handbag - and making sure that the people who should be compensated are fairly compensated and that the records associated with whatever it is are also very clear and available, you know, to bring better transparency to the systems that we have. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) TEHRANIAN: Because of NFTs, Chris Torres, Nyan Cat's creator, has received direct compensation for his creation. But what's more is he'll continue to receive compensation every single time the NFT is resold. This is because of the royalty system baked into the smart contracts that govern NFTs. NFTs are software. They can be programmed. And with something as complicated as royalties, which require enormous amounts of legal and manual labor to implement in our analog world, we can now express them in a few simple lines of code. This represents a breakthrough innovation for any industry predicated on royalty payments, such as publishing or music. And just as blogs and MP3s re-architected these industries in decades past, NFTs will catalyze their next evolution. The internet dissolved our geographic boundaries. NFTs dissolve economic boundaries. ZOMORODI: OK, so those are some big promises, especially for a technology that many people think is just a fad, maybe even a scam, a way to get rich. I mean, Amy, there is a lot of fraud out there when it comes to cryptocurrencies, blockchain projects. But there are also a lot of believers. Is that just how innovation works - you get the dark side with the early adopters? WEBB: So again, with everything, you know, this is the beginning of a transformation. And the trick here is to figure out what's trendy versus what's the trend, right? As a futurist, there are some rules that I use to sort of figure this out, and that represents a long-term movement into the future. You know, is an NFT meeting sort of basic human needs, and is this catalyzed by new technology? Yes, probably. Is it timely and going to persist over a long period of time? The NFT itself - probably not. But what it represents - and blockchain, that's probably here to stay. And finally, is this likely to evolve as it emerges? Because the long-term trends that matter tend not to be static. So, you know, we think about NFT and art and collectibles. That's trendy. The real trend is evolving from our current systems, from our current ways to authenticate people and the way that we're doing contracts, to more modern systems that represent the world as it is today. And that implies new types of authorities, new types of contracts, new types of authentication. It also probably means we're looking at a whole bunch of new types of cybercrime, right? Because any time you get a technology that's helpful, people find harmful uses for it. ZOMORODI: OK. So I think that brings me to my last question. A big part of your job, which you described earlier, is advising governments and corporations on the state of innovation. But, Amy, just remind us - like, why should we care about all this stuff? Why should we pay attention? Because it does sometimes feel like these topics - NFTs, blockchain, smart technology - they're kind of removed from our day-to-day lives. And some of them won't necessarily be ready for years to come, but I find it really exciting. So I'm just kind of curious about what you think. WEBB: The problem is that these are tricky subjects, and sometimes they really feel inaccessible. And I know that we all have - I'm a - you know, I think you and I are both very busy parents. The last thing I want to do at the end of a workday and dealing with homework and cooking dinner and everything else is, like - now I'm supposed to have any brainpower left to, like, talk about blockchain? Are you crazy? (LAUGHTER) WEBB: That is not what I want to do right now. I want to tuck in and, like - I want to go read a book or watch \"The Real Housewives. \" ZOMORODI: Yes. WEBB: For real, that's like - you know. But we can't close our eyes and sleep through this great awakening that's happening around us because we have fundamental technologies coming online that are going to reshape what the rest of humanity looks like. So I totally get it, but I also really care about our futures. And we all have a stake in it. ZOMORODI: That's Amy Webb. She's the founder and CEO of the Future Today Institute.

All of its mirrors and instruments sit on what looks like a shiny trampoline. As NPR's Rebecca Ramirez reports, this is the vital sunshield that has to keep the telescope cold. REBECCA RAMIREZ, BYLINE: Not just cold - really, really, really cold. Because scientists don't want the telescope's own heat to overwhelm what it's trying to see - faint infrared signals from the first distant galaxies that formed after the Big Bang. JANE RIGBY: It's going to be amazing, and it's still a little mind-blowing to think about it, right? RAMIREZ: Jane Rigby is a project scientist for operations of the telescope. She spoke to NPR recently. RIGBY: We're looking back so far out into space that we're seeing galaxies where the light's been traveling for almost all of the history of the universe. RAMIREZ: And as light from those galaxies travels through space. . . BILL OCHS: It elongates. The light waves elongate, and it shifts into the infrared, which is heat. So to observe the heat, you actually have to get really, really cold. RAMIREZ: That's Bill Ochs. He's the NASA project manager, and the actual huge telescope is all folded up and packed into a rocket ready to launch from French Guiana. But I met Ochs just outside of LA at a Northrop Grumman facility. That company has been developing the sunshield with NASA, and they've built an exact replica of it to help them troubleshoot any problems after launch. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Hi. RAMIREZ: Hello. The clean room it's in for safekeeping is massive. And to get a good look, you got to suit up because the point of a clean room is to keep out any contaminants like dust. OCHS: So for these, you just put on the hair nets like this. RAMIREZ: You got to put on a beard net, even if you don't have a beard, a hair net. . . (SOUNDBITE OF VACUUM RUNNING)RAMIREZ: . . . Clean your shoes and then put booties on your shoes, a smock, wipe down your recording equipment. You get the gist. And anyway, we finally get into the room, and the sunshield's the size of a tennis court - five kite-shaped hair-thin layers of a material called Kapton coated in aluminum. And it's really light. Like, I'm almost afraid it'll rip. In fact, Ochs tells me rips in space are something that they account for. It's why each of the sunshield's layers is made up of 50 pieces stitched together - think super high-tech quilting. OCHS: And that stitching is also ripstop. So, for example, if a micrometeorite were to hit a layer, it will only tear a little bit. It'll hit a ripstop and it'll stop. RAMIREZ: The sunshield starts to deploy about three days after launch, once the telescope swooshes past the moon. And the process is methodical. OCHS: As we go through each of the steps of the unfolding of the sunshield on orbit, we will match that here. So if we have any problems along the way, we actually can come in here and start looking at things in here. RAMIREZ: It takes a few days for the five layers to unfold. They separate so that there's a gap of several inches between each layer. OCHS: Once you get them fully separated, that will cool the telescope down to its operating temperatures, you know, tens of degrees above absolute zero when molecules stop. RAMIREZ: That's around negative 370 degrees Fahrenheit. And getting it that cold is a tough job because the top layer of the sunshield, which gets hit by the sunlight, is a toasty 230 degrees Fahrenheit. The sunshield's designed so that heat dissipates out into space in the gaps between the layers, so the temperature gradually gets colder and colder down to where the telescope's delicate instruments sit in the sunshield's shadow. OCHS: So you have a more than 600-degree Fahrenheit difference between the bottom and the top, all done by the sunshield. RAMIREZ: Now, the telescope will be about a million miles away from the Earth - so far away, it cannot be fixed in person, which is why scientists have spent years gaming out what could go wrong. OCHS: We've developed about 340 or 350 contingency procedures for the spacecraft, but there's always the thing that happens that you haven't thought of. RAMIREZ: And if something does go wrong with the sunshield, they'll be here in this clean room using this replica of the giant high-tech umbrella to try to figure out a fix.

But as NPR's Anya Kamenetz reports, some schools are innovating to meet those challenges, like in Guilford County, N. C. , where students are finding their way back to learning even after school hours. ANYA KAMENETZ, BYLINE: It's a beautiful fall afternoon. Sophomore Dreshon Robinson is headed to his high school cafeteria. DRESHON ROBINSON: I come here every day. KAMENETZ: He wants to be a music engineer someday. ROBINSON: I just like Adele, really. KAMENETZ: But right now, he's working evenings in a restaurant. And Monday through Thursday after school, he and dozens of his classmates come to Grimsley High School's learning hub. CHRISTOPHER BURNETTE: What you working on today? UNIDENTIFIED STUDENT #1: Science. BURNETTE: Science? Science is in this middle here. You got Ms. Moore-Lyons (ph). You see her? KAMENETZ: Here, from 4:30 to 6:00 p. m. , there are certified teachers to help students with any subject. One of the most popular is math. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: A negative ten is greater than a negative 11. UNIDENTIFIED STUDENT #2: Yep. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: So it has to be less than. (CROSSTALK)UNIDENTIFIED STUDENT #2: Appreciate it. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: You want veggie or meat? KAMENETZ: Tuesdays and Thursdays, there's free dinner, too. . . UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Tell me when. I'm just going to keep going till you tell me to stop. (SOUNDBITE OF BUS REVVING)KAMENETZ: . . . And a bus to take you home. These learning hubs first opened last fall in Guilford County, a large district in north-central North Carolina that includes Greensboro. They started off simply, as a way to connect to remote learning for the 1 in 5 families in the district who had no high-speed internet. Then, superintendent Sharon Contreras says, they saw another need, too. SHARON CONTRERAS: The high school students began working when their parents were losing their jobs, losing employment. KAMENETZ: So the district opened up the hubs on Saturdays. They served meals and offered students incentives, like a gift card to Sheetz for gas. CONTRERAS: So we had to find ways to keep them engaged and keep them moving forward toward graduation. KAMENETZ: It worked. In fact, with the help of increased flexibility from the state, Guilford County posted the highest high school graduation rate in its history in the spring of 2021 - 91. 4% - that in a district where two-thirds of students are living in poverty. CONTRERAS: We visited shelters. We were very concerned that we could not place our eyes on students, did not know if they were OK. KAMENETZ: This school year, when they came back in person, Contreras, the superintendent, says they did not want to leave any student behind. CONTRERAS: We already knew that academically they were suffering, but there are many more concerns that go beyond academic concerns. And that kept me up at night. It kept my staff up at night. It kept the board members up at night. So we just knocked on doors saying, please come back. It's safe to come back to school. KAMENETZ: Like districts all over the country, Guilford County has seen falling test scores after months of remote and hybrid learning and all of the stresses and traumas of the pandemic. The Walton Family Foundation, which is also a supporter of NPR, and the Michael and Susan Dell Foundations funded these learning hubs this fall to help students catch up. It's completely voluntary. And so far, numbers are small, but it does seem to be helping the students who do show up. BURNETTE: We have got a lot of kids who typically would have tapped out at this particular point in the year. KAMENETZ: That's assistant principal at Grimsley High School Christopher Burnette. He runs the learning hub. And he says when students have low grades in their first quarter. . . BURNETTE: They realize that this is a no-win situation, and then they start to fade back. KAMENETZ: Attendance drops. They're turning less work in. Grades plummet. That could have been Dreshon. He lost 15 days this fall to COVID quarantine. ROBINSON: OK, so we actually doing purines? SIERRA HANNIPOLE: Pyrimidines, yeah. So what goes with the T? ROBINSON: A. HANNIPOLE: You know it. KAMENETZ: We caught up with him in biology class. Today's lesson - DNA replication. HANNIPOLE: Biology is hard to teach from a computer. KAMENETZ: That's Dreshon's favorite teacher, his biology teacher, Sierra Hannipole. HANNIPOLE: When he got behind, it was a struggle to pick him back up. And that's unfair to him 'cause he does try. He tries really hard. ROBINSON: I don't want to ever go fall behind again because it was really hard. Like, you come in, and you look at everybody like, oh, Dre's back. And then you be like, oh, what are we doing? Oh, we doing this? I'm like, oh, I don't know what that is. KAMENETZ: Ms. Hannipole says since Dreshon has been going to the hub, he's more focused, more on top of the deadlines, and he speaks up in class. ROBINSON: What do we do? HANNIPOLE: What do we do? We read the instructions. OK. ROBINSON: Like, we understand it until the part where it gets. . . KAMENETZ: Dreshon says the learning hubs have changed his perspective on schoolwork. ROBINSON: I always felt like - I was like, man, studying is whack, like - but then you get to high school, and you like, dang, maybe I do need to study. But I'm like, I don't know how to study. So you go to the learning hub. They help you - you know, help you study. KAMENETZ: He's happy to be back at school in person. He says he wants to go to college and pursue his dreams.

NPR health correspondent Rob Stein joins us now with the latest. Hi, Rob. ROB STEIN, BYLINE: Hey there, Ailsa. CHANG: So it seems like fears about omicron are intensifying, I mean, just as millions of people are traveling and gathering for the holidays. Can you just talk about what the projections look like right now? STEIN: Yeah, sure. If you look at the trajectory of the outbreak in the U. S. , you'll see the number of people catching the virus has been shooting almost straight up for at least a week as the omicron variant has taken hold. And a flurry of new research released today projects that breathtaking tsunami of infections could rapidly dwarf previous surges. Here's Julie Swann from the North Carolina State University. She runs one of five teams of pandemic modelers making projections for the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists. JULIE SWANN: I've seen enough about omicron that I am worried that we could be getting into a situation that is really quite terrible. This could be the worst surge yet. STEIN: Swann's group and another consortium of modellers advising the CDC are so worried that they released preliminary projections today as part of an urgent warning that the nation needs to act quickly before it's too late. Both warn the omicron wave could swamp the health care system. A third new analysis from the University of Washington released today projects the number of people catching the virus every day in the U. S. could top 400,000 by the end of January. That's far above the worst days of last winter's horrible surge. CHANG: Wow. OK, all of this sounds really concerning. How bad are we talking exactly? STEIN: Yeah, you know, it could get bad, but the big question is how sick will omicron make people? CHANG: Right. STEIN: Because omicron is so incredibly contagious, it seems inevitable that the number of people catching the virus could be mind-boggling. But some of the early indications are that omicron may not make people as sick as the delta variant. If that turns out to be true, then things won't get nearly as bad as they would have if, you know, it had made people as sick as delta. The University of Washington group estimates omicron is far less nasty - at least 90% less likely to send people to the hospital and at least 97% less likely to kill them. But there's still a lot of skepticism about those estimates. Another new estimate from the Imperial College London out today suggests omicron is maybe 15% to 45% less likely to make people so sick they need to be hospitalized. But the bottom line is, no one really knows yet how serious a threat omicron poses. CHANG: Right. Well, the thing is a lot of hospitals are already overwhelmed now. So even if omicron is more benign, will hospitals be able to keep up? STEIN: Yeah, yeah. That's the big fear, that they won't. You know, even in the best-case scenario where omicron turns out to be milder, the lightning speed at which it's spreading means the number of people who are likely to catch it will be staggering. Dr. Anthony Fauci talked about this today at the White House briefing. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)ANTHONY FAUCI: Even if you have a diminution in severity, if you have a much larger number of individual cases, the fact that you have so many more cases might actually obviate the effect of it being less severe. STEIN: Because lots of people will still get sick, overwhelming hospitals that already can't keep up in many places. CHANG: Right. OK, Rob, is there anything to be optimistic about? I mean, help us out here. STEIN: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, you know, because the omicron wave looks like it tends to hit so hard and so fast, the models indicate that it could pass pretty quickly, too, you know, like a fast-moving hurricane. And it looks like that could already be happening in South Africa, but, of course, the U. S. is a very different country than South Africa, and the chances are that the wave will hit different parts of the country at different times and with different intensities, depending on all sorts of things, like how many people are vaccinated and boosted and wearing masks and taking other precautions. So public health experts I talked to are pleading with people to, you know, do all those things because they really can make a huge difference. CHANG: All right.

NASA is finally about to launch the most powerful space telescope ever - the James Webb Space Telescope. It's named after a former NASA administrator. Scientists have been waiting decades for this moment, and as NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce reports, there was a time when it seemed like this telescope might not even make it. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE, BYLINE: In the late 1980s, astronomer Garth Illingworth was deputy director of the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore. Its first big project, the Hubble Space Telescope, was still a few years away from launching. But one morning, his boss told him, look, you've got to start work planning for the next great space telescope, the one that will come after Hubble. GRANT ILLINGWORTH: And I said, ah, no, we can't do that. We're all flat-out working on Hubble. And he said, trust me - it's going to take a long time. GREENFIELDBOYCE: A long time. ILLINGWORTH: You know, we started out with a little group of, like, three people talking about this and sketching concepts on bits of paper and then putting simple things in the rudimentary computers we had back in the '80s. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Over 30 years later, what's now called the James Webb Space Telescope is waiting at a launch site in French Guiana. The telescope is three stories tall and has a mirror that's 21 feet across. It has a sunshield the size of a tennis court. But to fit inside the rocket, this massive telescope had to be designed to fold up and then unfold itself out in space. Illingworth says building it was a challenge. ILLINGWORTH: Because we're doing one-off technologies here in many cases. You know, there may be a lot of experience launching other missions and surveillance satellites and all the rest, but nothing is like James Webb. James Webb is unique. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Illingworth says, back in the beginning, there was a lot of pressure to keep costs down at NASA. So the telescope started out with a budget of only around a billion dollars or so. But that amount of money wasn't realistic. ILLINGWORTH: And that haunted the project for eight years and caused a lot of political anguish, I would say. GREENFIELDBOYCE: NASA kept asking Congress for more money, and the launch date kept getting pushed back. Things really came to a head about a decade ago in 2011. The House of Representatives moved to kill it. There was a political fight. ILLINGWORTH: We had teachers and schoolchildren writing, saying, you know, this is - Hubble's been amazing. This is our future. We want this mission. GREENFIELDBOYCE: NASA did a technical review that concluded the telescope was technologically feasible - just expensive - and so the project went forward. In the end, the final price tag ended up being around $10 billion. Lisa Storrie-Lombardi is an astronomer who serves as the director of the Las Cumbres Observatory. She says some scientists resented how much money was going to this one project. But now that it's a done deal. . . LISA STORRIE-LOMBARDI: I can't imagine that most of the astronomical community isn't actually just waiting to see it launch and really, really hopes that it works because if it works, it'll be a really spectacular scientific instrument. GREENFIELDBOYCE: The telescope will be so powerful it will be able to detect light sent out by some of the first galaxies to form after the Big Bang, helping to reveal how the universe evolved into what it is today. But first, this complicated instrument has to unfold itself perfectly. Storrie-Lombardi says there's a lot that could go wrong. STORRIE-LOMBARDI: It is a worry, I'm sure, for every astronomer in the world who's paying attention because space is hard. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Even as they worry, the community is already talking about the next major space telescope. They're thinking about a behemoth designed to study planets around distant stars to search for signs of life. If that one goes ahead, it could launch 20 years from now in the 2040s.

S. It finds that the death rate in the country went up dramatically in 2020 compared to the year before, primarily because of the COVID pandemic. As NPR's Rhitu Chatterjee reports, that led to the biggest drop in life expectancy seen in decades. RHITU CHATTERJEE, BYLINE: The overall mortality rate in the United States went up by nearly 17% last year. BOB ANDERSON: And that corresponded to a drop in life expectancy of 1. 8 years. CHATTERJEE: Bob Anderson is the chief of the mortality statistics branch at the CDC. He says all age groups 15 and up saw a rise in deaths last year. ANDERSON: Obviously, we have a large number of deaths that are directly attributable to COVID. CHATTERJEE: Ten percent of all deaths were due to COVID-19, making it the third-largest cause of death in the country. But there were rises in deaths from other causes, too, like heart disease and stroke. ANDERSON: We do know that COVID can cause circulatory complications, and so some of these might actually be COVID related. CHATTERJEE: And some, he says, were likely because people had trouble accessing care because of the pandemic. The report also documents a big jump in deaths from unintentional injuries, mostly drug overdose deaths, which had already started to climb up by the end of 2019. ANDERSON: As the pandemic arose, the increases got steeper, so the pandemic certainly, I think, had an impact, even though it's not the sole driver of what's going on. JOSE MANUEL ABURTO: Given the impact of the pandemic, specifically in the U. S. , it is not surprising that we see this drop in life expectancy. CHATTERJEE: Jose Manuel Aburto is a demographer at the University of Oxford. ABURTO: What I do find very surprising is the magnitude of the loss. CHATTERJEE: The report finds that the drop in life expectancy in the U. S. is the largest single-year decrease in more than 75 years. And Aburto and his colleagues' research shows that among 29 developed countries, American males experienced the biggest drop in life expectancy last year. Dr. Steven Woolf is director emeritus at the Center of Society and Health at Virginia Commonwealth University. He says even before the pandemic, the U. S. was already lagging behind other rich countries in health outcomes. STEVEN WOOLF: So there's a complex set of reasons why, in general, the health of Americans is inferior to people in other countries, and all of those issues rolled into the pandemic. CHATTERJEE: Lack of access to care and socioeconomic disparities are big factors, he says, and only exacerbated by the pandemic, causing disproportionate impacts on underprivileged communities - something that's documented in the new CDC report. WOOLF: The increase in mortality was twice as high for the Black population and three times as high for the Hispanic population. This is the product of our society and the barriers it places to access to health and good opportunity. CHATTERJEE: And those barriers will need to be addressed, he says, for the U. S. to see a drop in death rates in the long run, but with the pandemic still raging, we can bring down deaths in the short term by following public health guidelines. Rhitu Chatterjee, NPR News.

S. , there's news today on the vaccine front. First, the FDA is expected to authorize a booster dose of Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine for children ages 12 to 15 sometime next week. And two new studies out today suggest the Johnson & Johnson vaccine should be helpful in fighting omicron. NPR's Joe Palca is here to sort through this with us. Hi, Joe. JOE PALCA, BYLINE: Hi, Ari. SHAPIRO: What's in these two new J&J studies? PALCA: Well, the news we have from these studies comes, I'm afraid, from press releases. They haven't really been peer-reviewed yet, so we don't have the kind of scientific scrutiny on them that we would like or that should be. But what they do suggest is that the J&J booster dose may be able to prevent hospitalization of people exposed to omicron. That comes from a study in some 69,000 health care workers in South Africa. The researchers compared people who had two doses of J&J spaced six to nine months apart with people who had only one shot. And the results showed that the vaccine reduced hospitalizations by up to 85% when comparing people who got the booster and those who didn't. The study was done at a time when omicron was the dominant variant in South Africa. So the implication is it was doing something to prevent severe disease from omicron. SHAPIRO: And I said there were two studies about the J&J vaccine. What about the other one? PALCA: Right. The second one was a study in the laboratory from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston that looked at the blood from people who'd been fully vaccinated with the Pfizer vaccine and then given a booster, either the J&J vaccine as a booster or the Pfizer vaccine as a booster. Both enhanced the immune response against omicron in the lab, both antibodies and the what's called cellular immunity. But the J&J booster seemed to be doing a slightly better job. SHAPIRO: Why might that be the case? PALCA: Well, there's evidence that getting two different vaccine types might give a more robust immune response than just one. J&J is a viral vector vaccine. Pfizer and Moderna are mRNA vaccines. So that may be the difference. And these are numbers in the lab, so it's not entirely clear how they'll behave in the real world. SHAPIRO: So is this a game-changer? Should people rush out to try to get a Johnson & Johnson booster? PALCA: Well, no. I think it's premature for that. It's something that health officials will want to take a close look at. But mostly, what I'd say is this is positive news for Johnson & Johnson. That vaccine - it's a single-dose vaccine. It didn't have the kind of protection initially that the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines did. And there were reports about rare but life-threatening blood clots with J&J. So I think the company has been very eager to find some good news to report, and this seems to be it. SHAPIRO: Finally, tell us about the FDA's expected move to authorize Pfizer booster shots for kids ages 12 to 15. PALCA: Well, scientists know that children at that age can get COVID, and they know the vaccine can help prevent severe disease. And they know without omicron-specific - without an omicron-specific vaccine, the best thing they can do is to boost people's immune system so they are at peak - so that system is peak performance, so to speak. So boosters for 12 to 15 year olds is a logical next step. And there's some evidence that people have been boosted are less likely to transmit the disease to other people who are unvaccinated. So probably even people who've had only two shots - it would probably be a good thing to get a booster. The agency is also expected to authorize a Pfizer booster in children 5 to 11 with immunodeficiencies. SHAPIRO: NPR's Joe Palca. Thanks a lot. PALCA: You're welcome.
