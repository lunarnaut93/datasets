I'm Audie Cornish. If you've every straightened out a wire coat hanger, you know that once it's unbent, it doesn't bend back up on its own. But certain mixtures of metals remember their original shape and will re-bend themselves under the right conditions. Scientists at a Department of Energy National Laboratory have developed a new class of these materials with some remarkable properties. NPR's Joe Palca is always looking around for interesting inventions, as part of a project we're calling Joe's Big Idea, he found this one in New Mexico. JOE PALCA, BYLINE: The metal mixtures that have this memory property are called shape memory alloys. Here's how they work. Let's say you have a wire made out of one these alloys to set its memory you heat the wire up and give it to the shape you want. Let's say you just want a simple, straight wire. When it cools down you twist the wire, coil it, fold it - whatever. And then. . . DON SUSAN: When it heats back up, it remembers the high temperature shape that you set in it originally. PALCA: Don Susan is a material scientist at the Sandia National Laboratory in Albuquerque. He's set up a little demo for me at this lab bench. There's some wires and a glass beaker with boiling water. SUSAN: Here's a shape memory allow wire that the remembered shape is straight. And we can make it into whatever we want. PALCA: Don Susan starts bending the wire. SUSAN: Coil it up. PALCA: Then he holds the coiled up wire over boiling water. . . SUSAN: It happens pretty fast. PALCA: . . and dips the wire in. I don't know if you can hear that, but that clink is the wire smacking against the side of the beaker as it returns to its straight shape. Don Susan says the shape change occurs with considerable force, force you can use to flip a switch or pull a pin. These shape memory alloys are used today in medical devices, plumbing fixtures, even household appliances. The materials they're developing in New Mexico are different. SUSAN: The new alloys that we're working on, they transform at higher temperatures. PALCA: Commercially available memory alloys are made of nickel and titanium. They transform shape at room temperatures or body temperature, by adding one of three other metals. . . SUSAN: Platinum, palladium or hafnium. PALCA: . . . Don Susan and his colleagues are raising the shape changing temperature considerably - hundreds of degrees. And what does he plan to do with these high temperature shape memory alloys? SUSAN: We like the idea of using these alloys in safety devices, fail-safe devices. PALCA: Here's how that would work. Let's say you want to make sure that a bomb on a fighter jet won't go off accidentally. You could make a shape that would let the bomb function under normal circumstances. But if the plane caught fire, the shape would change all on its own - maybe pulling out a pin or breaking an electrical connection. SUSAN: Because these alloys will do their function in the fire perform and saving function. And so we like that. PALCA: What's not to like? Don Susan says fail-safe weapons are just the start. He sees thousand of potential uses for these high temperature shape memory alloys. Joe Palca, NPR News. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:  From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Audie Cornish.

They dance for Mary Poppins and play dumb commandos in DreamWorks' \"Madagascar. \"(SOUNDBITE OF MOVIE, \"MADAGASCAR\")COLE: And a visit to real, live African penguins at the Maryland Zoo doesn't do much to shake the stereotype.

JEN KOTTYAN: Her name is Peanut. COLE: That's avian manager Jen Kottyan. She knows all the penguins by name. There's Peanut, Winnie, Tux and dozens more. KOTTYAN: They are very, very awkward, and kind of clumsy out on land. COLE: But when Peanut dives into the water. . . (SOUNDBITE OF SPLASH)COLE: . . . she becomes sleek and graceful. And those little wings that seemed so silly on land suddenly become extremely useful. KOTTYAN: Their wings are small, in proportion to their body. But they are very, very powerful. COLE: They help Peanut reach 12 miles per hour in the water. She can make sharp turns, move side to side, and accelerate suddenly. It's this maneuverability - hard to achieve in human craft - that so impressed physicist Flavio Noca. FLAVIO NOCA: I was just amazed by their performance. And that's when, basically, I decided, OK, I want to work on penguins. COLE: Noca is works at Switzerland's University of Applied Sciences. He says that very little is known about how these champion swimmers manage their underwater acrobatics. NOCA: There are just, for some reason, only two basic papers. COLE: So, Noca set out to learn more. He started by filming zoo penguins to track the exact movement of their wings. NOCA: It was very hard, because penguins have their own mind, so they're not going to go where you want them to go. COLE: But after watching lots of underwater videos, Noca was able to figure out the exact angle and position of the penguin wing as it completes a stroke. But he still needed a way to model and control that movement in the lab, to understand how it generates its power. So, this year, one of his research assistants built an entirely novel joint mechanism that can perfectly mimic a penguin's flipper stroke. (SOUNDBITE OF SPLASHING)COLE: With the mechanical flipper churning in the water, Noca can better measure the flows and forces involved. He says someday, this mechanism could help underwater craft dart through ocean. When Noca presented his work at the American Physical Society's conference in Pittsburgh this winter, he wasn't the only one there talking about animals.

And over the past decade the government has paid out huge sums of money after floods, pushing the flood insurance program deeply into the red. Congress aimed to fix that by authorizing higher premiums, which created such an uproar that Congress is now trying to backtrack. NPR's Christopher Joyce reports. CHRISTOPHER JOYCE, BYLINE: After a natural disaster, it's FEMA - the Federal Emergency Management Agency - that provides food, shelter, money - pretty much whatever people need. But before a disaster, FEMA can help too, with flood insurance - cheap flood insurance. You can buy a FEMA policy for 40 percent less than the price private insurers would offer. But now, FEMA has a problem. CRAIG FUGATE: We are $24 billion in debt. JOYCE: FEMA director Craig Fugate recently sat before a congressional committee in Washington, D. C. , and made the case for raising insurance rates. A string of hurricanes and floods over the past decade has drained FEMA's insurance fund. And then people rebuild in flood zones, in part because FEMA offers cut-rate prices on one-fifth of its policies. FUGATE: The moral hazard of subsidizing risk is we're going to rebuild right where we were, just the way it was - and we're going to get wiped out. JOYCE: But here's the weird thing. FEMA already has the right to raise rates.  In 2012, Congress passed a law directing FEMA to charge real-life premiums, the kind of insurance rates that private companies would charge. Congress said you can stop subsidizing people, and FEMA did just that. In 2013, the first rate hikes were applied to second homes and properties that changed hands. In some cases, premiums went up by thousands of dollars. And right away, the phones in Congress started ringing - so much so that Congress called Fugate in to demand a stop to the very law it passed. Here's Congresswoman Maxine Waters, who actually sponsored the 2012 law that raised rates. The law is named after her. REP. MAXINE WATERS: Let me just say, all of the harm that has been caused to thousands of people across this country that are calling us, that are going to lose their homes, that are placed in this position, is just unconscionable. JOYCE: Now, Waters and other members want a lengthy affordability study to see just how high rates might go. They also want FEMA to finish updating its flood maps to see if people who are not in a flood zone now will end up in one. FEMA's Fugate doesn't think much of this idea. FUGATE: If we are going to continue to do this, if we wait until all the maps are updated, it will indefinitely delay implementation. STEPHEN ELLIS: It is buyer's remorse by the lawmakers. JOYCE: Stephen Ellis monitors the ups and downs of flood insurance for a group called Taxpayers for Common Sense. ELLIS: I mean they did the right thing and then that kind of outraged some of their constituents, who have howled quite loudly, and so now they're talking about undoing those reforms. JOYCE: He says subsidized insurance from FEMA means taxpayers are footing part of the bill for people who live in flood zones. Moreover, he says, artificially low premiums actually encourage people to rebuild where they probably shouldn't. ELLIS: Basically Congress is saying why didn't you protect us from ourselves? Why didn't you tell us that we were doing responsible reforms that were actually going to cost people money and have a bit of pain? Because that's what has to happen. It's the necessary medicine if this program is going to survive. JOYCE: There's another way to look at this, though - the way Gerald Galloway does. He's an engineering professor at the University of Maryland who studies floods and advises the government on how to deal with them. He says yes, there are flood-prone places - like Louisiana - that suck up a big share of FEMA's flood money. GERALD GALLOWAY: But wait a second. Thirty-five percent of our nation's oil and gas comes from the Gulf Coast, and these people are - live in some form of risk. JOYCE: Galloway says they need to live there, to keep the oil and gas business running. He favors a step back from raising rates now for most homeowners, to devise ways to cushion the impact of higher rates in flood-prone places. GALLOWAY: Recognize that it is not a flood insurance program. It is a program to maintain the viability of communities and their economy. JOYCE: So Congress is now drafting a new law to delay the one it passed in 2012. That delay could last as much as four years, at which point the 2012 law will expire. Christopher Joyce, NPR News.

I'm Linda Wertheimer. It's that time of year when you see Christmas trees lying on the curb looking a bit worse for wear. Many of those trees will be chipped into mulch, but a few will make it back to nature as trees, thanks to some unusual recycling programs. NPR's Adam Cole has a few stories of tree rebirth from around the country, and he delivers them in rhyming verse. ADAM COLE, BYLINE: It's the week after Christmas, and in every town, you'll see Christmas trees dying, their needles turned brown. Thirty million dead trees, that's what you'll find. RICK DUNGEY: Just some more numbers to boggle your mind. COLE: That's good old Rick Dungey, head of public relations, for the National Christmas Tree Association. He fields lots of calls and often they're dumb, or perhaps fueled by eggnog with way too much rum. DUNGEY: My tree's doing great. It's still taking up water. COLE: The calls start OK, but then they get odder. DUNGEY: Will it regrow roots and continue to live? COLE: Well, no, is the answer that Rick has to give. But there is still hope for all cross the nation, there's a sort of arboreal tree-incarnation. When everyone's done with their O Tannebaum - and Rick Dungey explains. . . DUNGEY: Mulching programs are common - but there have been some creative ones out there. COLE: He adds, some trees get a new life that isn't half bad. Down in Louisiana, where the land meets the ocean. . . JASON SMITH: We place them out in the marsh to combat coastal erosion. COLE: At the Department of Environmental Affairs, Jason Smith uses trees to make coastal repairs. The trees trap the soil, and make the waves slow. . . SMITH: And aquatic vegetation can begin to grow. (SOUNDBITE OF ELEPHANT)COLE: At Oakland's fine zoo, the word trunk is a term, that applies to both Christmas trees and pachyderms. The beasts lumber past, pining for treats, rooting around for a new thing to eat. Gina Kinzley, their keeper, says they prefer the sweet evergreens. GINA KINZLEY: The noble firs. COLE: The trees are both playthings and part of their diet. And they're not alone, other animals try it. KINZLEY: Giraffe and Zebra . . . COLE: . . . also give it a try. KINZLEY: Lions, tigers, the bears. . . COLE: Oh, my. KINZLEY: The elephants really enjoy the bark. COLE: It looks just like Christmas aboard Noah's Ark. (SOUNDBITE OF WATER FLOWING)COLE: The fishermen up north in Portland were stumped. The fish population has recently slumped. And part of the reason, says Mr. Mike Gentry, is that some of the streams are deplorably empty, of woody debris for the Coho and trout. There's no habitat. So, it's time to branch out. MIKE GENTRY: They need cover from predators. . . COLE: . . . to hide out below. GENTRY: They need a calm place to rest and grow. They also need a food source. COLE: So Gentry and his team sink dead Christmas trees in their swift local streams. (SOUNDBITE OF WATER FLOWING)COLE: In the east, Mitchell Mann and Dominic Esposito are two Jersey boys who live by one credo:MITCHELL MANN: To save the environment. DOMINIC ESPOSITO: Pretty much, being green. COLE: So, they drummed up a posse of like-minded teens. They'll grab all the trees - every one within reach, and they'll bring them all down to nearby Bradley Beach. MANN: Once the trees are on the beach, they're laid down against a fence. COLE: Where they form the foundation of coastal defense. ESPOSITO: And as the wind blows, the trees capture the sand. COLE: And soon dunes will form - at least that's the plan. And in future years. . . ESPOSITO: When a storm comes through, it protects all the houses. . . COLE: . . . and habitat too. Though their life has been sapped and their trunks have been hewn, these trees might form forests in marshes and dunes. And dead groves will grow in the rivers and zoos. I'm Adam Cole, NPR News.

Down in Louisiana, where the land meets the ocean. . . JASON SMITH: We place them out in the marsh to combat coastal erosion. COLE: At the Department of Environmental Affairs, Jason Smith uses trees to make coastal repairs. The trees trap the soil, and make the waves slow. . . SMITH: And aquatic vegetation can begin to grow. (SOUNDBITE OF ELEPHANT) COLE: At Oakland's fine zoo, the word trunk is a term, that applies to both Christmas trees and pachyderms. The beasts lumber past, pining for treats, rooting around for a new thing to eat. Gina Kinzley, their keeper, says they prefer the sweet evergreens. GINA KINZLEY: The noble firs. COLE: The trees are both playthings and part of their diet. And they're not alone, other animals try it. KINZLEY: Giraffe and Zebra . . . COLE: . . . also give it a try. KINZLEY: Lions, tigers, the bears. . . COLE: Oh, my. KINZLEY: The elephants really enjoy the bark. COLE: It looks just like Christmas aboard Noah's Ark. (SOUNDBITE OF WATER FLOWING) COLE: The fishermen up north in Portland were stumped. The fish population has recently slumped. And part of the reason, says Mr. Mike Gentry, is that some of the streams are deplorably empty, of woody debris for the Coho and trout. There's no habitat. So, it's time to branch out. MIKE GENTRY: They need cover from predators. . . COLE: . . . to hide out below. GENTRY: They need a calm place to rest and grow. They also need a food source. COLE: So Gentry and his team sink dead Christmas trees in their swift local streams. (SOUNDBITE OF WATER FLOWING) COLE: In the east, Mitchell Mann and Dominic Esposito are two Jersey boys who live by one credo: MITCHELL MANN: To save the environment. DOMINIC ESPOSITO: Pretty much, being green. COLE: So, they drummed up a posse of like-minded teens. They'll grab all the trees - every one within reach, and they'll bring them all down to nearby Bradley Beach. MANN: Once the trees are on the beach, they're laid down against a fence. COLE: Where they form the foundation of coastal defense. ESPOSITO: And as the wind blows, the trees capture the sand. COLE: And soon dunes will form - at least that's the plan. And in future years. . . ESPOSITO: When a storm comes through, it protects all the houses. . . COLE: . . . and habitat too. Though their life has been sapped and their trunks have been hewn, these trees might form forests in marshes and dunes. And dead groves will grow in the rivers and zoos.

For example, this note on a piano. (SOUNDBITE OF PIANO NOTE)WERTHEIMER: Now, someone with perfect pitch would be able to recognize that note as middle C, and they wouldn't need to refer to any other reference but their brain. The story goes that Ella Fitzgerald's band would use her perfect pitch to tune their own instruments. But is it something you are born with or is it something you can learn? Harvard professor of molecular and cellular biology Takao Hensch joins us to talk about his study on a pill that might give us the answer. Takao Hensch, thanks so much for joining us. TAKAO HENSCH: Thank you for having me. WERTHEIMER: So, can you just begin by explaining why people have perfect pitch in the first place? Is it in their genes? HENSCH: Well, there are a lot of thoughts about this. There seems to be some relationship to genetics, perhaps. But primarily, people believe it's a function of early life experience or training or exposure to music. WERTHEIMER: Could you just walk us through how your study worked? What did you actually do? HENSCH: This study was an investigation of adult brain plasticity and whether we could reopen it through the use of a drug called valproic acid. It's a mood-stabilizing drug. But we found that it also restores the plasticity of the brain to a juvenile state. And during a two-week period on this pill or a controlled substance, a healthy cohort of young adult male subjects who were carefully screened not to have had musical experience early in life, they were asked to undertake a number of training tests online. And at the end of this two-week period, they were then tested on their ability to discriminate tones to see if the training had more effect than it normally would at this age. WERTHEIMER: So, you actually gave people a pill and then you taught them to have perfect pitch? HENSCH: This is the result and it's quite remarkable, since there are no known reports of adults acquiring absolute pitch. WERTHEIMER: Now, I understand that you also studied that you might be able to use this plasticity to teach language. HENSCH: Yes. In fact, there are a number of examples of critical period-type development; language being one of the most obvious ones. And so the idea here was could we come up with a way that would reopen plasticity, paired with the appropriate training, allow adult brains to become young again. WERTHEIMER: What an extraordinary idea. What do you think the chances are that, say, 10 years, 20 years down the road that it might actually be possible to suddenly be able to teach people who don't speak French to speak French or people who never even heard Chinese to speak it? HENSCH: I think we're getting closer to this day because we are able to understand at greater cellular detail how the brain changes throughout development. But I should caution that critical periods have evolved for a reason. And it is a process that one probably would not want to tamper with carelessly. WERTHEIMER: What does that mean? HENSCH: Well, if we've shaped our identities through development, through a critical period and have matched our brain to the environment in which we were raised, acquiring language, culture, identity, then if we were to erase that by reopening a critical period, we run quite a risk as well. WERTHEIMER: And are you convinced that it might be possible to do it without erasing anything you wanted to keep? HENSCH: I think the results of this study are quite encouraging from that point of view. What the pill provides is an opportunity. WERTHEIMER: Thank you so much for joining us. Takao Hensch.

Here are the voices of some meteorologists around the country. This was in Indianapolis. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: This is the coldest wind chill I've ever reported in on the Weather Channel. It's 41 below zero. The air temperature is 13. In fact, it has dropped eight degrees in four hours this morning, as that wind just eats right through you. GREENE: And no surprise, it is also cold in Green Bay, Wisconsin. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: Could be so cold the National Weather Service is calling them life threatening, saying wind chill temperatures could dip as low as negative 50 today. GREENE: It is cold as far South as Baton Rouge. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: I don't know if we've ever really talked about having a wind chill advisory in effect in our area, but indeed. . . GREENE: The bitter weather is a result of the ominous sounding polar vortex. And joining to explain this vortex is Andrew Freedman, senior science writer for Climate Central, an independent non-profit organization that researches and reports on the science and impact of climate change. Andrew, welcome to the program. ANDREW FREEDMAN: Thanks for having me. GREENE: So, let me start with the question that's on the minds of a lot of Americans right now, and that is why is it so cold? FREEDMAN: Well, it's so cold because we have this polar air, this polar vortex, which is this area of low pressure and fast-moving winds over the Arctic that normally stays pretty friendly and up over Canada. GREENE: Friendly to us, at least. Not to Canada, I guess. FREEDMAN: Friendly to the U. S. , at least. This is air that is circulating the Arctic. And in the last couple of days, it's sort of become lopsided, sort of like a figure skater that has extended their arms, and then tripped. You know, when a figure skater pulls their arms in, they spin tighter and tighter and faster and faster. But when they put their arms out, they are a little bit slower and a little bit more wobbly and more prone to fall or stop skating at the end of their routine. And what's happening now is that a piece of it is down on the other side of the globe, and a piece of it kind of got lopsided and came down on top of us. It just is a weather pattern that we don't see very often. GREENE: Well, I wanted to ask you: How often do we see it? How rare is it for one of these things to come down onto the lower 48 of the U. S. ? FREEDMAN: Well, it's not all that rare to get pieces of the polar vortex to break off and affect parts of the U. S. What's rare is that this is sort of a huge part of the vortex that has descended on us and a huge area of the U. S. that's being affected. We have single-digit temperatures, overnight lows all the way from the Deep South near the Gulf Coast to the U. S. -Canadian border, all the way up to Maine and Minnesota. I mean, this is a huge expanse. You can say that it's the coldest that it's been since at least the early '90s, and in some places since the early '80s and late '70s. Thankfully, it's kind of this brief taste of how bad it can get, and then we go back to average, to slightly above average temperatures. GREENE: I mean, is climate change playing some sort of role here in the cold we're seeing this week? FREEDMAN: We actually have these possible connections between the Arctic - which is warming rapidly, and which is losing sea ice - and these perturbations, these shifts in the jet stream over North America and over Europe. And many scientists are convinced that there's enough circumstantial evidence to potentially convince a jury that there is this link, and that the weather patterns are becoming more and more suspicious as being influenced by human activities. But the physical connections, the actual smoking gun that would link Arctic warming to weather patterns that we see right now - like this one - isn't quite there yet. It hasn't quite been proven. So whether or not it would convince a jury of scientific peers in this case is unclear. And I think in the next few years, we'll know a lot more. But certainly, climate change is influencing every weather pattern that occurs today, in some ways large and small. GREENE: Andrew Freedman, stay warm and thanks so much for talking to us.

I just want to run that through Google here. Minus 55 C to F. Minus 67? MAYEWSKI: Yep, and that's without the wind chill.

It's a great time to crack your teeth if you don't remember to warm up some of the things you're going to eat. BRUMFIEL: OK. So that's cold for Earth. But it's toasty compared to other parts of the solar system. Check out the forecast on Saturn's moon Titan. ELIZABETH TURTLE: Titan's surface temperature is 94 Kelvin which is -290 Fahrenheit.

SARA HARAVIFARD: You know, (unintelligible) without too much trouble, we can get to minus 459. 13 Fahrenheit. BRUMFIEL: In some sense, temperature is just the jiggling of molecules and atoms.

If you stir a cup of liquid helium, it will keep whirling forever. Haravifard studies materials at these low temperatures in order to figure out how they work. Well, normally she does anyway.

And there is little relief in sight. From member station KQED, Lauren Sommer reports that water managers are trying to squeeze every last raindrop out of Mother Nature with an old technology: cloud seeding. LAUREN SOMMER, BYLINE: Droughts tend to produce a lot of wishful thinking and Jeff Tilley says, as a cloud-seeder, it definitely comes his direction. JEFF TILLEY DESERT RESEARCH INSTITUTE PROFESSOR: There's only so much we can do. If we could make the clouds appear out of thin air we would, but we can't do that yet. SOMMER: Tilley runs the cloud seeding program at the Desert Research Institute in Reno, Nevada. And he says weather modification, as it's called, is about making rain, not making clouds. (SOUNDBITE OF FOOTSTEPS)SOMMER: It happens at the summit of the Alpine Meadows Ski Area, north of Lake Tahoe, right where the chairlift drops off. (SOUNDBITE OF CHEERING)SOMMER: Most skiers don't notice the large metal bunker with a chimney on top. (SOUNDBITE OF MACHINERY)SOMMER: So it's going? PROFESSOR: It's going. SOMMER: This isn't a snow-making machine, like the ones ski areas are relying on this winter. The chimney is releasing tiny particles of silver iodide. These are the seeds in cloud seeding, rising thousands of feet up into the air. How do they work? Well, clouds are made of millions of tiny water droplets, but those drops don't automatically fall as rain or snow. PROFESSOR: Water needs some sort of substance to condense upon. SOMMER: It needs something to stick to, tiny particles like dust. If a cloud doesn't have enough dust, Tilley says. . . PROFESSOR: You have these very static, dead clouds that don't precipitate, don't produce any water and just keep moving right through. SOMMER: That's where the silver iodide comes in. Tilley says it's the right shape and size to help snowflakes form. Cloud seeding only works in certain conditions - you have to have clouds, of course - and it has to be colder than 20 degrees. But over a season, Tilley says it can make a difference. PROFESSOR: What we find is a range of anywhere between eight and 15 percent increase in water. SOMMER: The silver iodide ends up in the local environment where some worry it's a contaminant, though Tilley says tests show only trace amounts. Cloud seeding in California started more than 50 years ago. Though back then, it was a closer to magical thinking, an idea Tilley says has stuck around. PROFESSOR: We get voodoo. We get, you know, Dr. Frankenstein. We get all sorts of things. But we've been able to refine the technology. PETER GLEICK: For a long time there's been hope that we could somehow figure out a way to squeeze more water out of nature. SOMMER: Peter Gleick is president of The Pacific Institute, a water policy think tank. He says it's hard to verify exactly how much water cloud-seeding produces, and if it's worth the money. A review by the National Academy of Sciences, in 2003, found that more research needs to be done to prove its effectiveness. GLEICK: But even more importantly, it's limited no matter what. We get a certain number of clouds with moisture in them. If we can wring a little more out of those clouds, that's sort of the idea behind cloud seeding. But we're not going to wring a lot more out of those clouds. And so it's not a silver bullet. There is no silver bullet for California's water problems. SOMMER: Across the state, water agencies spend three to $5 million a year on seeding, which is estimated to boost runoff by about four percent. That might not sound like much, but as water resources get tighter, cloud seeder Jeff Tilley says his field is getting a second wind. Nine other Western states also use seeding, including Colorado, Texas and Utah, where it's commonly done with airplanes. PROFESSOR: I think for the entire inner Mountain West, it's becoming more important. It's not going to be the whole answer but it can be one tool in the toolkit. And it's a cost-effective one. SOMMER: Tilley says cloud seeders are looking to cut costs further by using drones instead of planes. The demand is on the rise, he says, as the West relies more than ever on every last raindrop. For NPR News, I'm Lauren Sommer in San Francisco. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: You're listening to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:  The snow pack in the Mountain West is down, way down from previous years. 2013 was the driest year ever recorded in many parts of California. And there is little relief in sight. From member station KQED, Lauren Sommer reports that water managers are trying to squeeze every last raindrop out of Mother Nature with an old technology: cloud seeding. LAUREN SOMMER, BYLINE: Droughts tend to produce a lot of wishful thinking and Jeff Tilley says, as a cloud-seeder, it definitely comes his direction. JEFF TILLEY DESERT RESEARCH INSTITUTE PROFESSOR: There's only so much we can do. If we could make the clouds appear out of thin air we would, but we can't do that yet. SOMMER: Tilley runs the cloud seeding program at the Desert Research Institute in Reno, Nevada. And he says weather modification, as it's called, is about making rain, not making clouds. (SOUNDBITE OF FOOTSTEPS) SOMMER: It happens at the summit of the Alpine Meadows Ski Area, north of Lake Tahoe, right where the chairlift drops off. (SOUNDBITE OF CHEERING) SOMMER: Most skiers don't notice the large metal bunker with a chimney on top. (SOUNDBITE OF MACHINERY) SOMMER: So it's going? PROFESSOR: It's going. SOMMER: This isn't a snow-making machine, like the ones ski areas are relying on this winter. The chimney is releasing tiny particles of silver iodide. These are the seeds in cloud seeding, rising thousands of feet up into the air. How do they work? Well, clouds are made of millions of tiny water droplets, but those drops don't automatically fall as rain or snow. PROFESSOR: Water needs some sort of substance to condense upon. SOMMER: It needs something to stick to, tiny particles like dust. If a cloud doesn't have enough dust, Tilley says. . . PROFESSOR: You have these very static, dead clouds that don't precipitate, don't produce any water and just keep moving right through. SOMMER: That's where the silver iodide comes in. Tilley says it's the right shape and size to help snowflakes form. Cloud seeding only works in certain conditions - you have to have clouds, of course - and it has to be colder than 20 degrees. But over a season, Tilley says it can make a difference. PROFESSOR: What we find is a range of anywhere between eight and 15 percent increase in water.

One contender for the world's oldest map was found in Turkey in an ancient city that dates back 9,000 years. Some archaeologists say the map shows an erupting volcano looming over what looks like a schematic plan of the city. Others aren't so sure it's even a map at all. NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce reports that a study of volcanic rocks provides a new clue. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE, BYLINE: The prehistoric settlement in central Turkey is known as Catalhoyuk. Thousands of people once lived there in mud-brick houses that were crammed together like honeycombs. It was a huge town for a time when people were first transitioning from hunter-gatherer to agricultural societies. The British archaeologist who was excavating the site in the early 1960s made a dramatic find - a mural. He said it showed a bird's eye view of the settlement's houses plus a distinctive volcano with two peaks, just like the one that lies about 80 miles away. This mural has often been called the world's oldest known map. AXEL SCHMITT: In volcano textbooks or textbooks about cartography and mapping, they would always in their introduction mention this mural and that it's potentially, you know, the oldest map, and the oldest depiction of a volcanic eruption. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Axel Schmitt is a geologist at the University of California, Los Angeles. He studies volcanoes, and he was doing fieldwork in Turkey when he first learned of this mural. He also learned there was a controversy - that this may not be a map at all. The image of the so-called erupting volcano, which is covered with dots, looks a lot like paintings of leopard skins seen elsewhere at the site. Plus, the so-called map of the city could be just a repeating abstract pattern, like the ones painted on other walls. Schmitt says, how could we ever really know? SCHMITT: You know, these people that lived in Catalhoyuk 9,000 years ago, they are - you know, they're fascinatingly strange to us. There's always a danger in taking our views and knowledge and trying to impose it onto, you know, a culture that is that different from ours. GREENFIELDBOYCE: But he knew at least one thing could be tested scientifically. If this was supposedly an image of the twin-peaked volcano erupting, it would be good to know if the volcano actually had erupted while people were living at the site. To find out, his team collected samples of pumice from the volcano's summit and flanks. They used two different dating techniques to determine when those rocks formed in an explosive volcanic eruption. And lo and behold, they found that there was an eruption about 9,000 years ago. SCHMITT: There was an eruption, you know, at the time people lived in Catalhoyuk. I think that is without doubt. GREENFIELDBOYCE: The uncertainty in all the measurements means they don't know whether the person who painted the mural was alive when it happened, but stories of a dramatic eruption could have been passed down for generations. SCHMITT: You know, volcanic eruptions are very impressive events. Maybe there was some idea that the mountain was a volcano that's part of the lore of the people of Catalhoyuk. GREENFIELDBOYCE: The results are reported in a scientific journal called PLOS ONE and they have impressed Keith Clarke. He's a cartographer at the University of California, Santa Barbara who has a special interest in the world's earliest maps. KEITH CLARKE: I can't say with 100 percent certainty but I would believe that the evidence is now in the favor of it actually being a map.

But top predators are now so rare, that many are in danger of disappearing. NPR's Christopher Joyce reports that is creating ripple effects throughout the natural world. CHRISTOPHER JOYCE, BYLINE: People who study ecology - the interplay of animals and plants in nature - say it's not rocket science. It's harder. ROLF PETERSON: We're dealing with the most complicated systems in the universe, and we hardly even know what the moving parts are. JOYCE: Rolf Peterson studies large carnivores. He and scientists like him are finding that as the number of big predators dwindles, everything around them changes. It's like a cascade down the food chain. Take cougars and wolves, for example. Fewer of them means their prey - deer and elk, mostly - multiply. More plant eaters means more plants get eaten, and everything that depends on those plants, from birds to butterflies, is affected. Carnivore biologist William Ripple from Oregon State University says even streams are affected, because armies of deer and elk can eat all the vegetation along the banks. WILLIAM RIPPLE: The stream actually changes course. So, we're finding that the predator can actually affect the shape of the stream. JOYCE: These cascade effects take all sorts of paths. Bears, for example, grab salmon out of rivers and eat them on the banks. The leftovers decay and add nutrients to the soil that help plants grow. RIPPLE: It's just a type of connecting-the-dots in nature. And it shows the inter-connectedness. JOYCE: Ripple and other carnivorists have published a study in the journal Science today that lists the benefits that predators provide. They note that where predators are reintroduced - such as in Yellowstone National Park - deer and elk and vegetation return to a more natural state. That may seem obvious. But Peterson, a biologist at Michigan Tech, says the extent of so-called carnivore benefits is not well-known, even as big carnivores disappear. PETERSON: You know, we have trashed the large carnivores for sure, and they're becoming more and more scarce. And we don't even have the science to tell us what we're losing. JOYCE: Scientific questions, such as: How many wolves or cougars or grizzlies do you need in, say, a national park to keep the other animals and plants under control? Peterson says the wolf has been an especially difficult case. It's made a comeback in the U. S. and Canada, but wolves sometimes prey on livestock. They compete with hunters for deer and elk. Many people have a deep-seated fear of them. PETERSON: How do we live with these creatures, and how will we accommodate them? And what will stop their increase once we put them back? So, we are in the driver's seat. JOYCE: Scientists are now calling for a global Large Carnivore Initiative to organize research on carnivore ecology, and, as Peterson points out, to illustrate just how predators has shaped our world.

GEOFF BRUMFIEL, BYLINE: You may have heard that birds fly in V's to save energy, that they're drafting like bicycle racers. And for a long time, scientists have thought the same thing. But they didn't have any proof. STEVEN PORTUGAL: All it was was theory. No one ever actually was able to measure anything. BRUMFIEL: That's Steve Portugal from the Royal Veterinary College in the U. K. Portugal is part of a lab that's built special devices that can fit on a bird's back and record the stuff you need to know if you're into bird physics. These gadgets have GPS and accelerometers. But they don't have transmitters. The only way to get hold of the measurements is to take the device off the bird's back. And this meant Portugal needed just the right birds to study formation flying: birds that fly in a V, take off and land in a predictable place, who don't mind getting handled by people. And that's where these guys come in. (SOUNDBITE OF NORTHERN BALD IBIS)BRUMFIEL: Meet the Northern bald ibis. That's its mating call, and it looks about as ugly as it sounds. PORTUGAL: Only a mother could love them, perhaps. But they are - they're very endearing. And they're just a bit different.

And the birds then follow the Microlite because they're following their foster parent. And they teach them the migration routes that they would have done historically. BRUMFIEL: OK. So these birds are the perfect test birds. And, as it turns out, they naturally organize themselves into a V formation. PORTUGAL: When they first start flying around, they will naturally put themselves into a V formation, but it won't be great. But it seems like with practice, they gradually get better and better at flying in a good V. BRUMFIEL: Portugal and his colleagues put their gadgets on the ibises. Then they compared the data to computer simulations. And the birds are drafting. They catch an uprush of air from the wing tip of the bird ahead. What's more, the birds were synchronizing their wing beats to maximize the effect. Portugal thinks there's a very good reason why the ibises do this. Flying is harder work than, say, running. PORTUGAL: When we get exercising, our heart rate goes up to about 180 beats per minute on a good day. When birds are flying, it goes up to 400 beats per minute.

C. is a pretty old city by American standards. It dates back to the late 18th century. Despite frequent facelifts, parts of it are wearing out - for example, its underground gas pipelines. NPR's Christopher Joyce reports on new research that reveals thousands of natural gas leaks in the nation's capital. (SOUNDBITE OF MACHINERY)CHRISTOPHER JOYCE, BYLINE: Washington, D. C. is a city in a constant state of reconstruction. That includes the streets, like the one I'm standing on, First Street Northeast, about a mile from the Capitol. Two blocks of asphalt have been opened up like a gutted fish. Somewhere in there, a gas pipeline has been leaking. It turns out a lot of old gas lines have been leaking here. Washington, as scientists have just discovered, is a pretty gassy city. And here's how the scientists found that out. ROBERT JACKSON: We drove 1,500 road miles in Washington, D. C. and found about 6,000 leaks. That's roughly four leaks every mile. JOYCE: Robert Jackson is an environmental scientist at Duke University. Four leaks a mile is even more than this team found in Boston, where they did the same thing - drive the streets with a special instrument that detects methane, that's natural gas. In fact, the average amount of gas lost to leaks in Washington is over twice the national average for cities. And not only were there more leaks. . . JACKSON: But in Washington, D. C. , the leaks were higher concentrations than anything we saw in Boston in a lot of cases. JOYCE: In 12 cases, the gas concentration was potentially explosive. Jackson says he informed the local gas company about those early last year. JACKSON: The really surprising thing was, when we went back four months later - after calling these leaks in - nine of the 12 hadn't been fixed. And that really shocked me. JOYCE: The city's gas company, Washington Gas Light Company, declined an interview request about this study, which appears in the journal Environmental Science and Technology. In a written response, the company said it, quote, \"immediately responds to every report of natural gas odor and repairs leaks seven days a week, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. \"Jackson notes that leaks can be hard to trace. Sometimes whole blocks have to be investigated to find one leak. Also, one-third of Washington's gas mains are cast iron, old technology that's prone to leaks. Washington Gas is replacing many of these. But plugging leaks is like plugging holes in a dike. DOUG JOHNSON: We have been plagued by a series of ongoing gas leaks. JOYCE: Doug Johnson lives in an old neighborhood of Washington. Like much of the city, though, there's remodeling going on, lots of new construction and truck traffic. Johnson says gas company workers return over and over to fix leaks on his block. He always asks the foreman, what's going on? JOHNSON: Basically these streets weren't really built to handle the large construction, the cranes. And he says, look, you know, the pipes are old, they're being put under enormous stress, that probably is your answer right there. JOYCE: Besides the inconvenience and the cost, methane leaks contribute to global warming. Duke's Jackson is one of many scientists measuring how much comes from cities, industry, farms - wherever. But it's been hard to get consistent numbers. JACKSON: The scientific community is still trying to figure out, you know, why those differences occur, and what the differences are in practices that might explain them. JOYCE: Even within Washington, there was a lot of variation. One area that turned out to be fairly gas-free was the National Mall, with the White House at one end and Congress at the other. Science is full of surprises. Christopher Joyce, NPR News. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:  Washington, D. C. is a pretty old city by American standards. It dates back to the late 18th century. Despite frequent facelifts, parts of it are wearing out - for example, its underground gas pipelines. NPR's Christopher Joyce reports on new research that reveals thousands of natural gas leaks in the nation's capital. (SOUNDBITE OF MACHINERY) CHRISTOPHER JOYCE, BYLINE: Washington, D. C. is a city in a constant state of reconstruction. That includes the streets, like the one I'm standing on, First Street Northeast, about a mile from the Capitol. Two blocks of asphalt have been opened up like a gutted fish. Somewhere in there, a gas pipeline has been leaking. It turns out a lot of old gas lines have been leaking here. Washington, as scientists have just discovered, is a pretty gassy city. And here's how the scientists found that out. ROBERT JACKSON: We drove 1,500 road miles in Washington, D. C. and found about 6,000 leaks. That's roughly four leaks every mile. JOYCE: Robert Jackson is an environmental scientist at Duke University. Four leaks a mile is even more than this team found in Boston, where they did the same thing - drive the streets with a special instrument that detects methane, that's natural gas. In fact, the average amount of gas lost to leaks in Washington is over twice the national average for cities. And not only were there more leaks. . . JACKSON: But in Washington, D.

But this turns out not to be a universal rule of nature. Scientists have discovered that trees keep growing faster the older they get. NPR's Richard Harris reports on this unexpected twist of nature. RICHARD HARRIS, BYLINE: Talk to any forester and you'll hear that trees seem to be a lot like people. They grow to a certain height, and then they stop getting taller. So it's easy to assume that their overall growth stops when trees reach that stage of maturity. NATE STEPHENSON: A very common assumption has been their growth rate declines with increasing size. HARRIS: Nate Stephenson, a forest ecologist with the U. S. Geological Survey, decided to challenge that common assumption. He rounded up dozens of colleagues from 16 countries and asked them to look back at the growth rate of nearly 700,000 trees that have been the subject of long-term studies. And according to results published in Nature magazine, the growth didn't slow down as these big trees got old and mighty. STEPHENSON: What we found was the exact opposite, that tree growth rate increases continuously as trees get bigger and bigger. HARRIS: Trees eventually stop getting taller, but they keep getting wider. And when scientists measured that extra girth, they discovered that these trees packed on more and more mass the older they got. STEPHENSON: It's as if on your favorite sports team you find out that the star players are a bunch of 90-year-olds. They're the most active. They're the ones scoring the most points. That's an important thing to know. HARRIS: Because in the world of trees, that means the oldest trees in the forest are doing the most to pull carbon dioxide out of the air and store it as carbon in their wood. Stephenson says that's another argument for preserving old-growth forests. STEPHENSON: Not only do they hold a lot carbon, but they're adding carbon at a tremendous rate. And that's going to be really important to understand when we're trying to predict how forests will change in the future, in the face of a changing climate or other environmental changes. HARRIS: Some ecologists have argued that young forests are more important than old forests for combating climate change. That's because the thousands of small trees that replace the few big ones collectively do pull more carbon dioxide out of the air than the mature forest does. But Stevenson says that doesn't give full credit to the importance of old, mature trees. Previous studies have suggested that old trees grow faster than young ones, but this huge study really makes that point. And Nathan Phillips, at Boston University, says the study's results have implications that go beyond conservation strategies. The findings challenge an assumption that seemingly applied to all of biology. NATHAN PHILLIPS: We didn't think that things could have unlimited growth potential at some level, at the organismal level. So there's been a long history of that kind of thinking. HARRIS: But the new study shows that when it comes to growth in trees, well, the sky's the limit. And this leaves Phillips wondering whether trees might in fact have the potential to live forever. He tries to imagine what would happen to a tree if you could prevent it from being blown down or succumbing to drought or disease. PHILLIPS: How long could it go? And I think that it could go for a long, long time - basically indefinitely. HARRIS: He's seen 500-year-old Douglas fir trees that are still producing scads of pinecones, which means they're still reproducing. So when it comes to aging, trees have something very special going on. Richard Harris, NPR News.

I'm Arun Rath. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)RATH: A few months before astrophysicist Carl Sagan died in 1996, he recorded a message to the future human inhabitants of Mars. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)RATH: Some of the earliest science fiction, back in the 19th century, imagined voyages to the Red Planet. We have spacefaring technology today. And getting to Mars actually seems within reach. But it would involve massive resources and a lot of danger. There are a lot of people, though, willing to risk it all for that chance. LIEUTENANT HEIDI BEEMER: Everything I have done academically and professionally has been for one reason: to leave this Earth and represent humanity on Mars. RATH: Army Lieutenant Heidi Beemer. To get to Mars sooner, she's willing to forgo the return trip. That's right, a one-way ticket to the Red Planet. We'll hear more from her later. A private organization wants to start a permanent human colony with volunteers like Beemer by 2025. That's our cover story for today: Humans on Mars. The risks and the reward. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RATH: A few years ago, President Barack Obama set out a more conventional goal for the mid-2030s. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH)RATH: Earthlings have actually been visiting Mars since the 1960s, or at least our machines have. First, there were flyby missions, then orbiters. Early primitive landers in the 1970s sent back the first pictures from the surface. But the real excitement began with the robotic rovers that started exploring the surface of Mars in the 1990s. NASA took a big leap forward when it landed the rovers Spirit and Opportunity on opposite sides of the planet. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)RATH: John Grant is a planetary geologist at the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum and part of NASA's rover mission team. DR. JOHN GRANT: I don't want to admit that I pretend that I'm a robot on Mars, but clearly, the science team kind of places themselves in the eyes and body of the rover when we look around, almost like we're there. RATH: So we've learned so much about Mars in recent decades, you know, from the rovers and also from the orbiters that have been mapping the surface of the planet. But I imagine there's probably still a ton that we don't know. GRANT: So think if you had all the continents on the Earth to explore and you've only been to a handful of places, would you say that you really kind of understand the Earth? And, of course, the answer would be no. And that's the situation on Mars. The surface area on Mars is about the same as the land area on the Earth. We feel like in some cases, we've been to a couple of national parks, but there's a bunch more we need to get under our belt. RATH: You must be familiar with the old unsettled debate that, is it worth sending humans into deep space beyond Earth orbit when robots can do so much - and we've seen them do so much. Am I wrong to assume that you're with the robots? GRANT: No. Actually, I'm, you know, I'm in both camps. I think that the robots are critical to setting the stage to understanding what's there and to doing the sort of precursor. But let's consider that Opportunity in 10 years has gone about a little over 38 kilometers, you know, a bit more than running a marathon on the Earth. You know, I'm no Olympic athlete, but over 10 years, I could certainly walk even very slowly many, many times that many marathons. With the rovers, it's much more sort of dragged-out process simply because we have to tell them every day what to do. It just takes longer. RATH: Even John Grant, a member of NASA's robotic rover team, thinks a manned missions is necessary. But there are a ton of concerns about sending people to Mars, not the type of stuff you can sort out after launch. And once you're off, it's a long trip. The shortest Mars trip would take more than a year roundtrip. So here on Earth, scientists are conducting experiments at sites built to simulate these long-duration missions. Kim Binsted is the principal investigator at one of these sites, located on one of Hawaii's volcanoes. KIM BINSTED: It's not the Hawaii you're used to thinking of and seeing ads for tourism. RATH: Binsted, a professor at the University of Hawaii, says there's no plant life around, no human activity visible. For the studies, crews live inside of a geodesic dome for months at a time. BINSTED: It's very small. It's about 1,000 square feet for six people, and that includes their workspace, their sleeping space, kitchen, laboratory and so on. And the crew can only go outside in spacesuits, mock-up spacesuits. So they really are in those tight quarters without a lot of relief for quite a long time. RATH: And for a long duration missions such as that, one of the first things you think about is how do people eat. So how do they manage the food situation? BINSTED: Right. Well, our first mission, which finished in August, was all about the food. We had both the completely pre-prepared food, which is similar to what NASA uses now, and we allowed the crew to do some basic cooking using shelf-stable foods. RATH: I know another one of the big concerns when talking about a mission like this is the psychological concerns about having people being stuck in the same environment with the same people for a very extended period of time. BINSTED: Right. And that's what our next three missions are looking at. We've got funding from NASA to do three more missions. And those missions are all going to be about psychology, crew cohesion, crew performance, basically how do you support a crew and pick a crew so that they don't end up wanting to kill each other. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RATH: And getting to Mars is only half the problem. Getting back is another thing entirely. Just think about all it takes to get a simple satellite into Earth orbit. Now, imagine launching a trip home from Mars. How do you pack your own launchpad, rocket, and the ridiculous quantity of fuel it takes to get home? One group of Mars enthusiasts is getting around all of that by saying forget going home. Mars One is a Netherlands-based nonprofit. They have the goal of establishing a permanent, sustainable human settlement on Mars by 2025. First, they'd send a series of robots to build a habitat and stockpile water. But their plan still faces a ton of serious problems, like potentially lethal levels of radiation on the Martian surface and the extreme Martian weather. There's still a lot of money to be raised, and the company is looking to crowd-funding for some of it. John Logsdon is the former director the Space Policy Institute, and he says the idea is more fantasy that fact in his mind. JOHN LOGSDON: It's not clear what they would do once they get there except be there. You know, it's not impossible, but I think it's very highly implausible. RATH: But that has not deterred more than 200,000 people from around the world from applying. Just over 1,000 made it to the second round. Twenty-five-year-old Heidi Beemer is one of them. BEEMER: I actually decided and told my parents when I was 8 years old that I was going to be an astronaut and I was going to go to Mars. RATH: Heidi Beemer is in the Army. She's a lieutenant and chemical defense officer with Fort Campbell's 63rd Chemical Company in Kentucky. To most, the concept of a one-way trip to another planet seems daunting and disturbing, even crazy. Beemer's mind is made up. BEEMER: The thought of being afraid or having the fear of the fact that I'm going to die on a different planet, it doesn't really bother me because this is something that will help out humanity for years and years and years to come. So if I'm going to die anywhere on Earth or anywhere, I might as well die doing something that's going to help out future generations. RATH: Her passion for the Red Planet goes back to an article she read in 1997 about the landing of NASA's Sojourner rover. BEEMER: From this newspaper article on the top was this giant panorama that was taken of just the Mars surface. And as a little 8-year-old kid, I'm looking at this going, wow. Like, this is awesome. We need to continue to explore this. And this little rover can only do so much. We need to send people. RATH: Mars One still has a lot of details to work out. But here's the plan for now: The final round of astronauts will be selected in 2015. Forty to 50 astronauts will be selected. They'll spend the next decade training at stations just like the one in Hawaii. Starting in 2024, the first set of four astronauts will set off on the one-way journey. Beemer says she's already connected with some of the other applicants. BEEMER: So there's a Facebook group called the Aspiring Martians Group. And this is a community of over 3,000, 4,000 people that all have aspirations of one day going to Mars. We've been talking, we've been communicating, we've been discussing what-if situations. We've been kind of being really supportive of each other. RATH: And these people seem a lot like the type of people that you would literally like to spend the rest of your life with. What do you think about the social aspect of this about, you know, having a life and a family eventually? BEEMER: I think moving forward, I'm OK with it. Creating a new family that I am ultimately going to bond with for the rest of my life is kind of a good consolation to just settling down with one person and having a family of my own. I'm really looking forward to it kind of growing into a giant extended family. RATH: How does your family feel about the prospect of you going to Mars and never coming back? BEEMER: They're super supportive. They, of course, are nervous, and they're a little afraid. But my senior of high school, I told my family, hey, I've decided that I'm going to go to a military school. And then after my senior year, I came home and said, mom and dad, I've decided that I'm going to serve my country and I'm going to be joining the Army. So once I finally sat down and said, mom and dad, I've applied to go to Mars on a one-way trip, I think this is kind of the point where they realize, OK, this kid's going to continue to surprise us and continue to do great things. So they're coming to realization with that. RATH: So even though you've got through to this cut, it's still pretty long odds at this stage. If Mars One doesn't work out, do you have a plan B? BEEMER: If this doesn't work out, it's just a matter of time before more opportunities come across. Regardless, my goal is to continue getting people excited about space. For me, just spreading the word about it and getting the younger generations excited about the project is something that I'm going to continue doing for the rest of my life, whether I'm on Earth or on Mars. RATH: Heidi Beemer is one of 158 applicants still in the running for a one-way trip to Mars. And by the way, Kim Binsted, the scientist from the Mars simulation habitat in Hawaii, is also a finalist for Mars One. As she put it, how could she not apply? With all of the unknowns, engineering and funding challenges, and safety risks, there's still a hope pulsing through the scientific community that humans will soon walk on Mars.

RATH: But that has not deterred more than 200,000 people from around the world from applying. Just over 1,000 made it to the second round. Twenty-five-year-old Heidi Beemer is one of them. BEEMER: I actually decided and told my parents when I was 8 years old that I was going to be an astronaut and I was going to go to Mars. RATH: Heidi Beemer is in the Army. She's a lieutenant and chemical defense officer with Fort Campbell's 63rd Chemical Company in Kentucky. To most, the concept of a one-way trip to another planet seems daunting and disturbing, even crazy. Beemer's mind is made up. BEEMER: The thought of being afraid or having the fear of the fact that I'm going to die on a different planet, it doesn't really bother me because this is something that will help out humanity for years and years and years to come. So if I'm going to die anywhere on Earth or anywhere, I might as well die doing something that's going to help out future generations. RATH: Her passion for the Red Planet goes back to an article she read in 1997 about the landing of NASA's Sojourner rover. BEEMER: From this newspaper article on the top was this giant panorama that was taken of just the Mars surface. And as a little 8-year-old kid, I'm looking at this going, wow. Like, this is awesome. We need to continue to explore this. And this little rover can only do so much. We need to send people. RATH: Mars One still has a lot of details to work out. But here's the plan for now: The final round of astronauts will be selected in 2015. Forty to 50 astronauts will be selected. They'll spend the next decade training at stations just like the one in Hawaii. Starting in 2024, the first set of four astronauts will set off on the one-way journey. Beemer says she's already connected with some of the other applicants. BEEMER: So there's a Facebook group called the Aspiring Martians Group. And this is a community of over 3,000, 4,000 people that all have aspirations of one day going to Mars. We've been talking, we've been communicating, we've been discussing what-if situations. We've been kind of being really supportive of each other. RATH: And these people seem a lot like the type of people that you would literally like to spend the rest of your life with. What do you think about the social aspect of this about, you know, having a life and a family eventually? BEEMER: I think moving forward, I'm OK with it. Creating a new family that I am ultimately going to bond with for the rest of my life is kind of a good consolation to just settling down with one person and having a family of my own. I'm really looking forward to it kind of growing into a giant extended family. RATH: How does your family feel about the prospect of you going to Mars and never coming back? BEEMER: They're super supportive. They, of course, are nervous, and they're a little afraid. But my senior of high school, I told my family, hey, I've decided that I'm going to go to a military school. And then after my senior year, I came home and said, mom and dad, I've decided that I'm going to serve my country and I'm going to be joining the Army. So once I finally sat down and said, mom and dad, I've applied to go to Mars on a one-way trip, I think this is kind of the point where they realize, OK, this kid's going to continue to surprise us and continue to do great things. So they're coming to realization with that. RATH: So even though you've got through to this cut, it's still pretty long odds at this stage. If Mars One doesn't work out, do you have a plan B? BEEMER: If this doesn't work out, it's just a matter of time before more opportunities come across. Regardless, my goal is to continue getting people excited about space. For me, just spreading the word about it and getting the younger generations excited about the project is something that I'm going to continue doing for the rest of my life, whether I'm on Earth or on Mars. RATH: Heidi Beemer is one of 158 applicants still in the running for a one-way trip to Mars. And by the way, Kim Binsted, the scientist from the Mars simulation habitat in Hawaii, is also a finalist for Mars One. As she put it, how could she not apply? With all of the unknowns, engineering and funding challenges, and safety risks, there's still a hope pulsing through the scientific community that humans will soon walk on Mars.", "section": "Space", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2014 NPR.

For the past 31 months, the spacecraft has effectively been asleep. Most of its instruments were shut off to save energy, including the radio for communicating with Earth. Mission managers can now start preparing Rosetta for a rendezvous with a comet later this year. NPR's Joe Palca has more. JOE PALCA, BYLINE: Rosetta went into hibernation in June 2011. There was an automated timer on board that had specific instructions to wake the spacecraft up two and a half years later, and send a radio signal back to Earth. There was no reason to think Rosetta wouldn't wake back up - it was operating just fine when it went to sleep. But still you can imagine the relief at mission control in Darmstadt, Germany when the signal came in. (SOUNDBITE OF CHEERING, APPLAUSE AT MISSION CONTROL)PALCA: Paolo Ferri was one of the people cheering. He's head of mission operations for the European Space Agency. PAOLO FERRI: Two and a half years were tough enough, but the last 45 minutes were very, very, very tough. I think I don't want to repeat that again. PALCA: So why did Rosetta have to hibernate? Well, the spacecraft gets its power from solar rays that convert light from the sun into electrical energy. But in order to catch up with the comet it's chasing, Rosetta had to go out nearly half a million miles from the sun. [POST-BROADCAST CORRECTION: It was nearly half a billion miles from the sun. ] And Ferri says that far away, the sun isn't very bright. FERRI: Although we have larger rays, we didn't have enough energy, electrical energy to keep all systems active. PALCA: So they left on the automated timer, of course, but they also left on some heaters. FERRI: Because you can imagine at those distances from the sun, we had to keep the unit from freezing. And so the little energy that remained on the solar rays, which was of the order of a few hundred watts, was used to operate the thermostatic heaters to keep the spacecraft as warm as possible. PALCA: Rosetta's main scientific mission starts this August, when it catches up with the comet it's been chasing since 2004, a comet with a name that doesn't exactly roll off the tongue - or at least, not my tongue. FERRI: Well, we pronounce it, Churyumov-Gerasimenko. PALCA: Churyumov-Gerasimenko. FERRI: Right. PALCA: Anyway, if everything goes according to plan, once Rosetta catches Churyumov-Gerasimenko, it will fly alongside for two years as the comet swings around the sun. It will also release a probe that is intended to land gently on the comet's surface. But before any of that can happen, Ferri says, in May Rosetta will have to make some crucial maneuvers. FERRI: At the moment, we are still flying very, very fast compared to the comet. We have to brake. PALCA: So that means Rosetta will have to fire its rocket engine, and it needs to change course slightly. Right now, Rosetta is not pointed in exactly the right direction, and that means a second rocket firing. FERRI: If something goes wrong with those and we can't, for whatever reason, deform them, then we don't have a mission. PALCA: Not that there's any reason to think the rocket engine won't work properly. It has in the past. But until it does, Ferri and his Rosetta colleagues will have to suffer through a few more tense moments. Joe Palca, NPR News.

Of the thousand-plus species of sharks and rays in the world, a new study finds nearly a quarter are threatened with extinction, making these ancient fish among the most endangered animals in the world. NPR's Richard Harris reports on the latest assessment of these feared, yet vulnerable creatures. RICHARD HARRIS, BYLINE: A group called the International Union for the Conservation of Nature maintains the so-called Red List of species threatened with extinction. They've been worried about sharks, rays and related species for more than 20 years. And the IUCN has finally totaled up the risk to these species, and published the results in the online journal eLife. SONJA FORDHAM: It's quite bad, I'm sorry to say. HARRIS: Sonja Fordham, who helps run the assessment, says it's not news that a lot of shark species were in trouble, but 25 percent of species at risk of extinction? That's a big number. FORDHAM: And of those, the rays are actually worse off than the sharks. HARRIS: Rays include mantas and skates, but also fish that look more like sharks, such as the sawfish, with a snout that looks like a double-sided saw. FORDHAM: So, the sawfishes are the most endangered of the group, by far. HARRIS: Fordham, who is president of Shark Advocates International, says some sawfish populations have already been driven to extinction. They're critically endangered elsewhere because they live along fragile coastlines, and because they're a prize catch for the Asian market. FORDHAM: People know about the global trade in shark fins, but few know that some of the most valuable fins that are used in shark fin soup come from the shark-like rays, species like sawfishes and wedgefishes and guitarfishes. HARRIS: Rays are also often snagged by fishermen actually trying to catch other species. For instance, the ironically named common skate is now extinct in some European waters because it was wiped out by fishermen angling for other species. When Fordham and her colleagues dug into the fisheries' catch data, they discovered that more rays had been fished out of the water than sharks. FORDHAM: They're also not getting much conservation attention. They tend to be a little underappreciated. HARRIS: The scale of the problem is breathtaking to Boris Worm, who was not involved in the IUCN study, but who has been studying the plight of sharks and related species at Dalhousie University in Canada. BORIS WORM: It's shocking to me, one in four sharks and rays. HARRIS: One reason he's surprised is information about these species is often hard to come by. Worm's group has been scouring global fishing records to get a sense of the magnitude of the problem. WORM: We estimated that, globally, we're catching at least 100 million sharks a year. That's 11,000 each hour, every day, 365 days a year. So that's a lot of sharks. HARRIS: Overall, he estimates that 6 to 8 percent of the global population of sharks and rays gets caught each year. And they simply can't reproduce fast enough to keep pace. These species evolved before the dinosaurs were on Earth 400 million years ago. WORM: And they're like a, you know, version-one model of a fish, if you will. So, they have an extremely slow life history. They grow very slowly, and their populations are depleted very quickly. HARRIS: The good news is that there are a few conservation success stories for certain species of sharks. Sonja Fordham says the challenge now is to spread those practices around the world and to include many more species that are currently heading toward oblivion. Richard Harris, NPR News.

Geologically speaking, it's the New Madrid fault zone. \tSince then there's been some small seismic activity. And scientists have gone back and forth on whether this area still poses a threat for another major earthquake. Some say it's seismically dead or at least in a deep sleep. Well, now research suggests that the New Madrid fault zone is alive and kicking. Joining me to talk about that is geologist Susan Hough. She's with the U. S. Geological Survey. She's coauthor of the study published this week in the journal Science. Ms. Hough, welcome to the program. SUSAN HOUGH: Thank you. BLOCK: And let's talk a bit about these big earthquakes in the Midwest over several months in 1811 and 1812. How big were they and how far away were they felt? HOUGH: Well, we don't know the magnitudes precisely because we didn't have seismometers, but we've estimated magnitudes of at least 7. 0 for the four largest earthquakes. They were felt all the way to the east coast. They rang church bells in Charleston, South Carolina. One of the documented fatalities was actually near Louisville, Kentucky, which is relatively far from the New Madrid zone. But as we know, in the east coast, the seismic waves travel quite efficiently. So, the effects of any one earthquake are felt more broadly. BLOCK: Now, I mentioned thought that the New Madrid faults were dead, even though there were some smaller earthquakes since those big ones. So, why the thinking that the fault zone was, if not dead, at least really sleeping? HOUGH: Right. Well, it has been assessed as a high-hazard zone, so this isn't entirely new. But there were really two arguments that it might in fact be dead. One was that you don't observe a lot of warping at the surface from GPS measurements and the other is the argument that the earthquakes we observe at the surface in present daytimes are actually aftershocks of the earthquakes 200 years ago. BLOCK: And your research seems to be saying otherwise, right? You're saying this fault zone is alive and kicking. HOUGH: Right. So, that was the part of the story that we focused on. If you sort of look at the activity that we know about, it kind of looks like an aftershock sequence, but we really tested that hypothesis very rigorously. And when you do that, the hypothesis just fails, because we know it's not a plate boundary, where big plates are moving past each other. Every indication is that there's active processes going on deep in the crust and we're not sure what they are and why they're happening. But our results tell us that something is alive and kicking down there to keep generating these small earthquakes, which we conclude are not aftershocks. BLOCK: Well, for folks who hare living in the New Madrid fault zone area, they're going to be wondering, you know, what's the likelihood, what's the probabilities that a really big earthquake could strike here again. Is there any way to answer that question? HOUGH: We can just sort of give an assessment of the overall probabilities. And what we know about New Madrid, the expectation is that a magnitude 7. 0-ish earthquake might happen once every 500 years. And a magnitude 6. 0-ish event might happen, on average, once every 50 years. It's been 1895 since we've seen the last event close to magnitude 6. 0. BLOCK: Susan Hough is a seismologist with the U. S. Geological Survey in Pasadena. Thanks so much for talking with us. HOUGH: Thank you. Glad to be here. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)BLOCK: This is NPR News.

BLOCK: And your research seems to be saying otherwise, right? You're saying this fault zone is alive and kicking. HOUGH: Right. So, that was the part of the story that we focused on. If you sort of look at the activity that we know about, it kind of looks like an aftershock sequence, but we really tested that hypothesis very rigorously. And when you do that, the hypothesis just fails, because we know it's not a plate boundary, where big plates are moving past each other. Every indication is that there's active processes going on deep in the crust and we're not sure what they are and why they're happening. But our results tell us that something is alive and kicking down there to keep generating these small earthquakes, which we conclude are not aftershocks. BLOCK: Well, for folks who hare living in the New Madrid fault zone area, they're going to be wondering, you know, what's the likelihood, what's the probabilities that a really big earthquake could strike here again. Is there any way to answer that question? HOUGH: We can just sort of give an assessment of the overall probabilities. And what we know about New Madrid, the expectation is that a magnitude 7. 0-ish earthquake might happen once every 500 years. And a magnitude 6. 0-ish event might happen, on average, once every 50 years. It's been 1895 since we've seen the last event close to magnitude 6. 0. BLOCK: Susan Hough is a seismologist with the U. S. Geological Survey in Pasadena. Thanks so much for talking with us. HOUGH: Thank you. Glad to be here.

I'm Melissa Block. A team of scientists claims they've created the most advanced clock ever. They say this clock is so precise it would neither lose nor gain one second in about five billion years of continuous operation. NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce reports on why anyone would want a timekeeping device this powerful. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE, BYLINE: At the most basic level, to make a clock you just need something that repeats itself over and over in a way that lets you count off equal increments of time. Like, say, the sun rising and moving across the sky or the phases of the moon. ADAM FRANK: Those were literally the first clocks for people. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Adam Frank is an astrophysicist at the University of Rochester who wrote a book called \"About Time. \" He says for ages telling time by the sun was good enough. FRANK: If you asked somebody a thousand years ago what time is it, the best they'd be able to do is say lunch maybe? GREENFIELDBOYCE: But when societies got more complicated, mechanical clocks took off. They were in bell towers, then in homes. Clock technology advanced from merely ticking off the hours to keeping track of every minute. It was a huge change for humanity that today we take utterly for granted. FRANK: When you're waiting for the bus and the bus is late, you feel those five minutes. The bus was supposed to be here at 9:55. It's 10 - oh my God, what's wrong this system, right? You feel those minutes as boredom, as anger, but that's only because you have a device that allows you to count off those minutes. GREENFIELDBOYCE: These days, though, we can do way better than count off minutes or even seconds. Since the 1960s, official timekeeping has been based on the natural oscillations of atoms. And so-called atomic clocks just continue to improve. A few years ago, a team unveiled a clock that would neither gain nor lose one second in about 3. 7 billion years. You'd think that would be good enough, but physicist Jun Ye says no, it's not. He works at the National Institute of Standards and Technology. This week, he and his colleagues published a report in Nature that describes an even more precise clock - one that would neither gain nor lose a second in five billion years. JUN YE: Many people would say, well, one second in five billion years - how is that going to impact our life? It's not. It's going to be irrelevant to what we are doing in daily life or in the society. Well, that's actually not true. GREENFIELDBOYCE: He says all kinds of technology we depend on - computer networks, GPS systems - is only possible because of the precision timekeeping of atomic clocks, even though the first atomic clock makers could not have predicted where their inventions would lead. YE: Nobody would have imagined everybody can have a cell phone and know exactly where you are. GREENFIELDBOYCE: His team's new clock is the most precise and stable in the world. It uses laser light to trap a few thousand atoms of a metallic element called strontium. Scientists can detect the oscillations or ticks of these atoms - 430 trillion per second. The team already has upgrades in mind to improve the clock's performance. Ye says maybe they'll be able to build a clock that is accurate to one second in 50 billion years or even way better than that. YE: Where does it end? Does nature place a fundamental limit of how good you can keep up, you know, you can keep the time? And as far I can tell at the moment, I don't see the limit. GREENFIELDBOYCE: He says future super clocks could help scientists explore the bizarre quantum world or probe the space-time fabric of the universe. He says imagine a network of immensely powerful clocks distributed around the Earth. If a black hole explodes in a distant galaxy. . . YE: . . . there will space-time ripples - they'll call it gravitational waves - will propagate. And we can actually just listen to the clock and they would know the heartbeat of the universe. GREENFIELDBOYCE: That's the kind of thrill that keeps clockmakers ticking. Nell Greenfieldboyce, NPR News. MELISSA BLOCK, HOST:  This is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. I'm Melissa Block.

So deeper than the Grand Canyon. MCEVERS: The crazy thing about this story is Ross found the valley by accident. He was on a routine research trip to Antarctica measuring the thickness of the ice.

It starts with a kindergarten teacher who we'll call by her first initial, M. We're not using her full name to protect her privacy. M. taught reading to 4- and 5-year-olds. But a few years ago, something happened that changed her life. She lost the ability to read. NPR's Rebecca Hersher reports. REBECCA HERSHER, BYLINE: M. always knew she wanted to be a teacher. M. : A teacher is all I ever knew how to do. It's all I ever wanted to do. I wanted to work with the younger children. HERSHER: M. taught reading at a kindergarten outside Chicago. She had walked the 4- and 5-year-olds in her class through their first sight words, the dog is brown. She had her own condo and taught Sunday school on weekends. M. : I'm a single person. I was living independently, lots of friends. I thought I had a pretty good life. I don't know, I loved teaching. I loved what I did, and it just made life very fulfilling. HERSHER: But in the fall of 2011, a week before Halloween, weird things started to happen. M. : There was a Halloween party at the park district, and I was taking money. And I remember, oh, there's three people here, that will be $9. And the woman looked at me and said, there are six of us. I didn't realize I had lost vision. I just knew that there was something weird. HERSHER: And other strange things were happening. M. got lost driving in her own neighborhood. She was confused about dates and times. And about a week after it began, she was trying to take attendance at school when she realized she couldn't type the numbers and letters of her computer password. Something was wrong. Dr. Murray Flaster is one of the doctors who's treated M. DR. MURRAY FLASTER: We believe that she had an inflammation of blood vessels in the brain. And that inflammation led to the cutoff of blood flow to a few areas in the brain. HERSHER: When blood doesn't get to the brain, that's a stroke. M. had had many, maybe even dozens of little strokes. And as she recovered, her most striking symptom was this: M. could write but she couldn't read. FLASTER: So if you give her a book and you ask her to read it, she knows it's a book. She knows there must be letters on the page. She knows there's words there, but she cannot recognize letters and put letters into words because of the exquisite nature of the brain damage. HERSHER: The strokes damaged the connection between the part of M. 's brain that takes visual information from the eyes and delivers it to the part of the brain that deciphers words. In a healthy brain, when you open a book, one part of your brain says, hey, those are words you're seeing. And it sends the words to be decoded in another part of the brain. In M. , that connection, which she built when she first learned to sound out words as a little kid, it's gone, which means she can't read anymore. M. : I miss the normalcy of it. There's so many things in the world that you take for granted. I never thought that I would say that reading was something that I took for granted. HERSHER: But here's where M. 's story goes from pretty dismal to kind of beautiful. Remember, M still knows how to write. In fact, she can understand language using other senses, just not sight. So she can listen to audio books, write stories and even transcribe words as they're said to her, which gave M. an idea. Instead of relying on her eyes, she would use touch and hearing to read. It works like this. When M. sees a jumble of shapes that look like a word, she begins by tracing each letter with her finger. M. : Let's say pit is the word that I'm looking at. So I would start M, N, O, OK, P. And I would keep tracing the P. Then I would go to the next letter, and I would trace A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I. OK. The first letter was a - and I would forget the first letter by this time. HERSHER: It's a maddeningly slow way to do it, but it's reading. Dr. Flaster says without knowing it, M. came up with a genius way to work around the damaged parts of her brain. FLASTER: She discovered that all by herself. And we speculate that the fact that she was an expert in teaching children how to read perhaps made her more likely to discover that than someone else who might otherwise be stricken similarly. Of course, I can't prove that, but it seems to make sense. HERSHER: M. isn't the first person to come up with the tracing method. It's actually worked for other patients too. But it's a long road. Two years after her strokes, M. 's reading is still laborious. On a good day, she can decipher about one word every two seconds. But she's not letting it slow her down too much. She has a new job, working at the community gym. And she wants to tell her story. In her free time, M. is writing a book, typing it word by word and getting friends to help her read it.

Some scientists say the Grand Canyon is young, in relative terms, just six million years old, while others argue that it dates back to the days of the dinosaurs, much earlier. NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce reports that one group now thinks it has the answer. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE, BYLINE: At the south rim of the Grand Canyon, there's a walking path called the Trail of Time. It uses the Grand Canyon's awesome scenery and rocks to try to convey the vastness of geologic time. And it tells tourists that the Colorado River carved the Grand Canyon in the last six million years. KARL KARLSTROM: The trail of time exhibit has what we considered at the time, in 2010, to be the scientific consensus on the age of Grand Canyon, and that's five to six million years old. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Karl Karlstrom is a geologist at the University of New Mexico who worked on the exhibit. He hiked the canyon as a kid and has studied it professionally for 30 years. He says figuring out when a canyon was carved is not easy because rivers carve canyons through erosion. KARLSTROM: And erosion takes away material and so geologists are left without the rock record, without the physical evidence of the carving. What you are left with is a landscape, a land form. GREENFIELDBOYCE: In recent years, scientists have started using sophisticated new techniques that can reconstruct the history of erosion by analyzing the chemistry of one of the minerals that make up canyon rocks. And in 2012, one research team concluded that the Grand Canyon was actually cut about 70 million years ago, in the late Cretaceous, which startled experts like Karlstrom. KARLSTROM: That whole episode - is it old, is it young - caused my group to rethink what we meant by old and young and what is the evidence. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Now, in the journal Nature Geoscience, he and some colleagues describe a new creation story for the Grand Canyon. They say it is neither old nor young; rather, it's both. They think that about six million years ago, a river forging a zigzagging path across the Colorado plateau found part of its way through old canyons that already existed which means that although the Grand Canyon as a whole is relatively young, a couple of sections are more ancient. KARLSTROM: We're making a major leap from thinking of a canyon that has a simple history, it was all carved at once either at 70 or at five to six, to a more sophisticated understanding of how landscapes actually evolve through time. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Not everyone thinks this will be the last word. Brian Wernicke is a geologist at Caltech who is in the more ancient Grand Canyon camp. He doesn't buy all the arguments in this new paper. But to him, the important thing is that it shows a real shift in people's thinking. BRIAN WERNICKE: In the mid-2000s there was this monolithic view that oh, yeah, the Grand Canyon is very young and it was cut six million years ago by the Colorado River which was born six million years ago. OK? That's not the discussion right now. We've all learned that it's a lot more complicated than that. GREENFIELDBOYCE: He expects that over the next year, there will be more data and more debate. Karl Karlstrom says, for a scientist, all this is exciting. It's spectacular. You know, if you're willing to change your mind, based on evidence, it's great fun. He says now, when he takes river trips through the canyon, he sees it with new eyes. Nell Greenfieldboyce, NPR News. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)INSKEEP: This is NPR News.

KARLSTROM: And erosion takes away material and so geologists are left without the rock record, without the physical evidence of the carving. What you are left with is a landscape, a land form. GREENFIELDBOYCE: In recent years, scientists have started using sophisticated new techniques that can reconstruct the history of erosion by analyzing the chemistry of one of the minerals that make up canyon rocks. And in 2012, one research team concluded that the Grand Canyon was actually cut about 70 million years ago, in the late Cretaceous, which startled experts like Karlstrom. KARLSTROM: That whole episode - is it old, is it young - caused my group to rethink what we meant by old and young and what is the evidence. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Now, in the journal Nature Geoscience, he and some colleagues describe a new creation story for the Grand Canyon. They say it is neither old nor young; rather, it's both. They think that about six million years ago, a river forging a zigzagging path across the Colorado plateau found part of its way through old canyons that already existed which means that although the Grand Canyon as a whole is relatively young, a couple of sections are more ancient. KARLSTROM: We're making a major leap from thinking of a canyon that has a simple history, it was all carved at once either at 70 or at five to six, to a more sophisticated understanding of how landscapes actually evolve through time. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Not everyone thinks this will be the last word. Brian Wernicke is a geologist at Caltech who is in the more ancient Grand Canyon camp. He doesn't buy all the arguments in this new paper. But to him, the important thing is that it shows a real shift in people's thinking. BRIAN WERNICKE: In the mid-2000s there was this monolithic view that oh, yeah, the Grand Canyon is very young and it was cut six million years ago by the Colorado River which was born six million years ago. OK? That's not the discussion right now. We've all learned that it's a lot more complicated than that. GREENFIELDBOYCE: He expects that over the next year, there will be more data and more debate. Karl Karlstrom says, for a scientist, all this is exciting. It's spectacular. You know, if you're willing to change your mind, based on evidence, it's great fun. He says now, when he takes river trips through the canyon, he sees it with new eyes. Nell Greenfieldboyce, NPR News. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) INSKEEP: This is NPR News.

That's one trend noted in a new book by my guest, journalist McKenzie Funk, who has looked into how some entrepreneurs - and even sound nations - stand to benefit from climate change. His subjects range from investors buying water rights and farmland around the world, to private wildfire protection services for affluent American homeowners, to the nation of Greenland, which will be able to exploit new mineral deposits as its ice melts. McKenzie Funk's work has appeared in Harper's, National Geographic and The New York Times. His new book is called \"Windfall: The Booming Business of Global Warming. \"Well, McKenzie Funk, welcome to FRESH AIR. You begin the book with describing being on a Canadian military vessel which is firing weapons into the water. What on earth was going on? (LAUGHTER)MCKENZIE FUNK: I think the Canadians were trying to look tough for everyone defending the Northwest Passage, which they would like to claim as their own internal waters. It's a disagreement over basically who owns that patch of the Arctic and it matters because of, well, the shipping lanes that are opening up as the ice pulls back. There's also oil. DAVIES: Right. So we're talking about new shipping routes that are now going to be open to commercial shipping because the melting of ice in the Arctic. Give us a sense of sort of the scale of the melt and the shipping opportunities it presents. FUNK: I started reporting this book in 2006. At that point, they were saying, you know, maybe 20-30 years in the future we will see an ice free Arctic in summer. We might be able to use the Northwest Passage then. And point of fact, by the next summer, there was an opening seen by satellites in the Northwest Passage. The summer of 2007 was a massive ice loss; I want to say it was the size of Texas was missing from the usual summertime shrinkage, and it has only accelerated, I think. There are three different ways you can ship over the top of the world. You could go through the Northwest Passage, which is through the Canadian archipelago, north of Canada, North of North America. It leads to. . . DAVIES: And we're talking about a passage from where to where? FUNK: It would go from the Eastern Seaboard, basically, from the Atlantic to the Pacific over the top of the world. This is something that explorers had tried to find for centuries - 1700s, 1800s, everyone wanted to find a way that wasn't the Panama Canal to go to the Pacific and they hoped this would be it. And until now it wasn't. The other main shipping route across the top of the Arctic would be the Northeast Passage or the Northern Sea Route, which goes across the top of Russia, and this one's proven to be the most viable economically. We've seen a massive growth in shipping already - 20-fold, 30-fold since 2007. DAVIES: And again, we're talking about vessels that go from where, the Atlantic ports of the U. S. ? FUNK: These vessels are mostly going to and from Western Europe - or Northern Europe and Asia, China. The big excitement over the shipping routes is that they'll save a ton of time versus the Suez Canal for the Panama Canal. And so that most of the big shipments that it happened now have come from basically northern ports within China, and they'll go over the top of Russia and they'll end up in Europe or Northern Europe. And eventually, we may see the same thing happening in the Northwest Passage, which so far hasn't been used as much commercially. DAVIES: So when the Canadian government asserts some military authority over the Northwest Passage, the sea route across the top of the ocean from the Atlantic to the Pacific, what are they saying, that they want to charge folks for going there or they want to restrict it in some way? FUNK: I think it's both of those. I think there could be some real economic benefits. Russia does charge fees to have icebreakers help you along the way. Canada can conceivably do that same thing. But in the case of the Canadians, I think it's mostly about not being pushed around and having this part of their country that they find to be very important to them and wanting the U. S. to not use it when we feel like it. DAVIES: So if you have a circumstance where the melting of the Arctic ice which, you know, to many is a catastrophic development, in fact, opens commercial possibilities for some countries in the Arctic, it raises another question which is what are some other ways that this would benefit countries in the Arctic? What are some of the ways that Arctic countries may stand to benefit economically from climate change, from global morning? FUNK: I think the main benefit for the North - there is some question to whether fishing will help and a lot of those economies and right now are based on fishing, whether fish docks will in fact move further north, and if fishing will be better. But I think that is an open question scientifically. The main benefit right now is oil and gas. Up to a quarter of the world's remaining oil and gas is in the Arctic and there's been a major push to go get it. DAVIES: So we're talking about oil and gas deposits which were inaccessible when they were frozen over, is that right? And now they're going to be reachable? FUNK: I think that's right. The oil companies will say, look, we've drilled for oil in the Arctic before; it's not just that the ice is pulling back, that's not the only thing that's happening. And I think that's true. You know, one thing that's happened is we've kind of gotten all the easy oil everywhere else in the world, and what's left is the Arctic. At the same time, there's no question that the ice pulling back helps for exploration and it helps for drilling. It allows them to have a longer summer season, you know, no one's going to be doing ice exploration or oil exploration when the Arctic is covered in thick ice. But if you look at Shell's case in Alaska, they had a longer season because the, you know, the ice wasn't there. DAVIES: You write that Royal Dutch Shell did some thinking and planning about the prospects for and consequences of climate change and came up with two scenarios, one called Blueprint, the other Scramble. Let's go through them. What's the Blueprint scenario and what does it dictate in terms of their activity? FUNK: In 2007, they came out with these scenarios, and they said these are how we're thinking the world could turn out over the next 40 years. And Blueprints is the world sort of what we want it to be. We want the governments of the world, especially at a local level, to start putting a price on carbon. We want there to be carbon taxes or cap-and-trade. We want that to push innovation to move to a greener economy. There'll be wind. There'll be solar energy. That'll be a big mix of energies certainly, because in both of these scenarios they draw out and they think that the world will be using more energy. And at the same time, they think there will be more natural gas than, say, coal. DAVIES: So that scenario, which they called Blueprints, essentially posits that the world responds aggressively to climate change and begins to change the way we do things. If the world does that, how did Shell think its business model would change? FUNK: Well, it was already positioning itself to be heavier in natural gas than it was in oil. And so it assumed that its business would move toward a higher natural gas mix. It had invested in things like the London Array, which is a giant wind farm off the coast of the U. K. It was looking at all sorts of advanced biofuels, things down in Brazil. And at the same time, it didn't think that its fundamental business would change, it would still be an energy company, it would still be an oil and gas company. It would just be one that was perhaps smarter and ahead of the curve than the other one. It basically assumed that regulations would and should come and then at some point its business would be undermined by the fact that the world is worried about climate change, and so it might as well get ahead of this curve. DAVIES: And then there was this other scenario that it's, you know, think tank came up with called Scramble. Well, what the Scramble predict for the world? FUNK: Well, I think the description of it was to say that events would outpace actions in Scramble. That we basically wouldn't do anything about climate change, we wouldn't do anything about the coming energy shortage, that we would sort of just let things happen and we would have a bunch of band-aids. We would scramble for coal when we needed coal and we would scramble to find more oil. And we wouldn't really sort of at a governmental level - or even especially international level - have some sort of way to get to where we need to go in terms of the energy system. DAVIES: And so if that's the world we're heading into, the company sees its business model differently too, right? FUNK: Yeah. I think that means being part of this scramble. Also, sort of trying to gobble up the world's oil, also trying to kind of go ahead and do what they're doing. DAVIES: And so when you looked at what the company is up to and talked to some of its executives, what was your sense of which they see coming true? FUNK: Well, I asked, Jeremy Bentham is the head of their Scenario team now. He's their sort of in-house futurist. And I asked him, is it the view that the Scramble scenario is the one that's come true so far? And he said, yes. Absolutely. That's what's been happening. You know, nothing really happened at the Copenhagen Climate Accords in 2009. They were expecting that the world would come up with a treaty and would start moving toward arresting climate change. There was a push around that same time to do a climate bill in Congress and that died on the vine. And so all these sort of top-level regulatory actions that they thought would push this - push this more blueprintsy(ph) kind of scenario didn't happen. And because of that it, yeah, it does look like a scramble. It doesn't look like any action is being taken at an international or a national level to arrest climate change. And because of that, you know, Shell thinks, well, we're not being regulated in the way we thought we were. This looks more like a scramble. DAVIES: So go get the oil. FUNK: Yeah. DAVIES: McKenzie Funk's book is called \"Windfall: The Booming Business of Global Warming. \" We'll continue our conversation after a short break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, we're speaking with journalist McKenzie Funk. His new book, \"Windfall\" is about new commercial opportunities that have been opened up by climate change. It's called \"The Booming Business of Global Warming. \"Greenland is particularly an interesting case. You traveled to Greenland. Tell us about what you saw there in terms of the effects of climate change and what its - how its future seems to be changing. FUNK: I think Greenland is the most interesting case of all here because it's hard not to root for them. You know, it's a very massive country with a tiny population. It has about 57,000 people and it's beautiful. And then they were longtime, they've longtime been dependent on Denmark, which as colonists goes, been a benevolent country. And yet, Greenland wants to have its own independence. It wants to be in charge of what it does. And they think their path forward is to earn enough money from oil and gas and from mining that they don't have to get their annual subsidy from Denmark. And Denmark says, well, if you can pay your own way you're free to go, you're free to be free. So I went there on a road show with most of the leading politicians in Greenland. In advance of a vote - they were going to have what they call self-governance, which was a degree of independence that they hope will lead to full independence. This involved getting in helicopters, flying from village to village and having meetings with all these citizens who were wondering about this upcoming vote and saying. OK, what's this mean for us? How much money are we going to get from minerals if we do this? Who is going to be in charge of defense? And all the politicians from the main four parties - including the premier - and the leaders of the other parties would sit there and answer questions. And three out of four were very much in favor of this self-governance and eventual independence. Along the way, we spent a lot of time with citizens, you know, your average Greenlanders who by and large didn't seem too concerned with what was happening with climate change. And I don't mean that they were happy about not being able to hunt in the winter, probably because the ice was too brittle, but new fish stocks were moving in and they did seem to want independence. The vote wasn't even close. In some of the villages I went to, I think they voted 97 percent in favor of self-governance. And the country as a whole, it does now have self-governance, which means almost everything but defense is being handled by Greenland itself. DAVIES: And did the citizens of Greenland that you spoke to, and did you see, I mean physical changes in the landscape from climate change? What's actually happening there? FUNK: Yeah, absolutely. The most stark examples where it came from, one fisherman who told me about some new fish species that had freaked everyone out when it appeared five years ago and now it was the basis of their economy. It's because the waters had warmed and the species was moving, moving up. Another friend lived in a village that in wintertime they used to be able to travel to and from a larger city via taxi on the ice. It would get so frozen in the sound that they would have an ice road, it would go to and from and it was much cheaper. And some. . . DAVIES: This was crossing a body of water on a taxi? (LAUGHTER)FUNK: Exactly. Well, which really isn't that scary when they're, you know, 20 feet thick of ice below you. But this, I think two winters ago, they had such a warm winter that there was no ice and they had to get to and from the village they had to take helicopters. It was still too dangerous to do boats because there would be little icebergs and that's obviously horrible. The seal hunters have a harder time because they're going out on the ice. If the ice is brittle, they can't hunt as they traditionally did. But the other big example was one of the mines called the Black Angel. Black Angel has what was once the highest grade zinc in the world and may still be. It did run up in the '70s and then shut down because they thought they'd gotten all the good stuff. And maybe five years ago, some British geologists were out there walking around the defunct mine and they saw that a glacier had pulled back and they sampled some of the rocks below that glacier and they found a zinc deposit just as good as the first one. Just as big. It was enough to open up the mine. And they now have a shipping season that's two months longer to and from that mine because the ice isn't there in the fjord as much. So a very clear case of climate change causing the ice to go away and that helping the local economy. And for Greenlanders who have been very well educated by Denmark and who are remarkably worldly, who have a very good Internet connection and have better fashion sense than I do, you know, these were all good things. They're excited to have their independence. DAVIES: Yeah. Does anybody worry about, you know, having a zinc mine expand? I mean, that may not be the most pleasant neighbor. FUNK: Yeah. And this is a big issue. They just had an election, in fact, and one of the big questions in the election was how much should be endanger our environment which we've depended on forever in order to fund this independence? And there was a big protest vote. A lot of people said, no, we can't just say yes to any oil company that comes. And at the same time, the party that was voted back into power, the prime minister, she's pushing for allowing uranium mining. And that's because that's the way she sees forward to independence. But, you know, they are very aware of the dangers of particularly the zinc mine. That mine had left a bunch of tailings in the fjord before and they said any mine that comes in now, we need to have strong regulations to stop that. They are very worried about the oil companies and about what could happen in a spill. Oil spills are extremely hard to clean up in ice. It's very remote. You know, you can't respond to a spill up there like you could in the Gulf of Mexico. And they're aware of that. But it's a small country and they need money, so I think there's an open question still. DAVIES: We're speaking with McKenzie Funk. His book \"Windfall\" is about commercial interests that see possibilities for profit in global warming. We'll continue our conversation after a short break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR, and if you're just joining us, we're speaking with journalist McKenzie Funk. He has a book about new commercial opportunities that are being exploited with climate change. It's called \"Windfall: The Booming Business of Global Warming. \" You know, one country that's been dealing with rising seas for centuries is the Netherlands, and, you know, you write about some Dutch companies that see opportunities to export their water management technology around the world as the seas rise. And you describe a visit to Rotterdam and this enormous storm surge barrier there. Can you just describe it? FUNK: Sure. You've done well by calling it enormous. It's called the Maeslantkering or Maeslant Storm Surge Barrier and it's these two Eiffel Tower-sized gates. They swing open - or, rather, swing closed and close the Port of Rotterdam which is the most important port in all of Europe. It's where most of the oil and gas come in and most of everything leaves. And they have a huge warning system. It's this computer warning system that says, OK, the tides are surging, we need to close the barrier. And that actually happened for the second time in history late in 2013, just a few months ago. DAVIES: So we're talking about a huge metal gate that's as long as the Eiffel Tower is wide but it moves through the water on hinges so that in effect it kind of closes off the water, closes off the port. FUNK: Yeah. And there's also something that comes up from the bed of the canal there, the passage there. And so it basically just swings closed from both sides and they meet in the middle, these two massive gates. And then this piece comes up from below and it closes it off the entire harbor. Water can't get in, water can't get out. DAVIES: And the company that built this took a look at New York. What would it take to protect New York, right? Now, tell us what they came up with. FUNK: They did. Well, a few companies have worked on these. The company that worked in New York was Aracdis, the Dutch company that made, I think, the most amazing presentation at one of these meetings I went to with a bunch of engineers. And it's basically the Maeslantkering, the Maeslant Barrier, modified for New York. And it would go across the narrows. That's the area below the barriers on a bridge. And it would do the same thing. It would swing closed. Now, that gap across the narrows is actually larger than what they had to span in Rotterdam and, you know, the basic mechanism is the same, though. Storm comes, warning system warns, and the gates swing closed, and Manhattan is protected. DAVIES: And how big would these gates be? FUNK: I don't know the exact numbers but they're, again, we're talking Statue of Liberty or more. And that's just for the gates. I mean, if you've ever driven across the Verrazano Bridge you know that it's a massive span and especially if there's traffic it takes a long time to go across. And these are gates that have to swing across and close most of that gap. DAVIES: And what would it cost, do we know? FUNK: Estimates are pretty varied at the moment but in the order of $10 billion. DAVIES: Right. Now, there's a downside. If you have something like, say, Superstorm Sandy or something worse and a storm surge coming, you close the gates, the gates work. The water doesn't disappear, right? FUNK: Yeah. And I think that that was something that the engineers at Arcadis and in general in Holland they are not slow to point out. I think they're very aware of the fact that when water hits something like this, it spreads out. So if you build gates that block off the Verrazano, then those areas in Brooklyn and Staten Island on either side - on, basically, on the wrong side of that gate - they're going to get a bigger storm surge, I think about two feet or more. It means that you're protecting Manhattan but you're flooding these generally poorer areas on the outside. I mean, it's sort of a metaphor for a lot of these things with climate change. DAVIES: Right. But it's one thing to offer an idea to New York which would save Manhattan at the risk of flooding Staten Island. I mean, that would be politically problematic and they haven't put money into that. Are there places in the world where people have bought the technology and are installing it? FUNK: There are storm surge barriers already in St. Petersburg, Russia. There's one helping protect London. There's - Singapore has something of the sort. There are sea walls outside of Shanghai, although not something quite like this. So - and then of course Venice. That one's quite well known, although that's more because Venice is sinking than because sea levels are rising. But, yeah, these are being installed. Arcadis, this same company we've talked about, has done a lot of work in New Orleans, in fact, on levies and smaller storm surge barriers. And so this, you know, in recent storms it's worked quite well. DAVIES: You know, your book describes, you know, private interests that see a chance to make money from the effects of climate change and sovereign states that appear to be positioned to profit. Do you see either the private interests or the governments deliberately influencing public policy to discourage efforts to halt global warming? Are we seeing people who will, you know, happily destroy the planet to make a buck? FUNK: I have not seen that, no. I think it's an important point to say that the people I have talked to, I don't think they were necessarily bad people. Now, they were looking to make a buck but I don't think many of them were wanting, OK, let's let the planet burn so I can make this buck. It's more that they were sort of hopeless about the prospects. And I don't think there's any lobbying against sort of climate action. But I wouldn't doubt that the fact that many of us are not going to be as bad off as, say, your average Bangladeshi slows action on climate change. There's - the charge levied at, say, Halliburton that it likes war. I always find that a bit dubious. I think that's the same for these companies. I don't think that they like climate change. I think they're looking to make money in it and I think if there was more of their bottom line at risk that maybe they'd be more pro-climate action. Maybe they'd be pushing harder to stop it. But actively working against it, I never saw any evidence of that. No. That, for me, after years working on this book was the major takeaway, was this sort of imbalance, the idea of this unevenness of the effects. You know, some of us will get rich off climate change. Some of us will at least be able to pay for the technologies that can protect us. You know, Manhattan versus Staten Island. That, on a global scale, is pretty important if you want to understand why are we not doing anything about climate change. Sure, there are skeptics but there's also the fact that we in the north and in the west are either going to be fine or even better off, in some rare cases with climate change, or we're going to be able to protect ourselves with these technologies and we can pay for them. But you're not going to see a lot of the world being able to afford a giant $10 billion sea barrier. You're not going to see a lot of the world being able to afford desalination plants to get water if they're running dry. And you're not going to see all the world being able to buy up farmland if theirs goes fallow. And I think that explains a lot about climate inaction and really raises the moral stakes. DAVIES: Well, McKenzie Funk, I want to thank you so much for spending some time with us. FUNK: Well, thank you.

DAVIES: So we're talking about oil and gas deposits which were inaccessible when they were frozen over, is that right? And now they're going to be reachable? FUNK: I think that's right. The oil companies will say, look, we've drilled for oil in the Arctic before; it's not just that the ice is pulling back, that's not the only thing that's happening. And I think that's true. You know, one thing that's happened is we've kind of gotten all the easy oil everywhere else in the world, and what's left is the Arctic. At the same time, there's no question that the ice pulling back helps for exploration and it helps for drilling. It allows them to have a longer summer season, you know, no one's going to be doing ice exploration or oil exploration when the Arctic is covered in thick ice. But if you look at Shell's case in Alaska, they had a longer season because the, you know, the ice wasn't there. DAVIES: You write that Royal Dutch Shell did some thinking and planning about the prospects for and consequences of climate change and came up with two scenarios, one called Blueprint, the other Scramble. Let's go through them. What's the Blueprint scenario and what does it dictate in terms of their activity? FUNK: In 2007, they came out with these scenarios, and they said these are how we're thinking the world could turn out over the next 40 years. And Blueprints is the world sort of what we want it to be. We want the governments of the world, especially at a local level, to start putting a price on carbon. We want there to be carbon taxes or cap-and-trade. We want that to push innovation to move to a greener economy. There'll be wind. There'll be solar energy. That'll be a big mix of energies certainly, because in both of these scenarios they draw out and they think that the world will be using more energy. And at the same time, they think there will be more natural gas than, say, coal. DAVIES: So that scenario, which they called Blueprints, essentially posits that the world responds aggressively to climate change and begins to change the way we do things. If the world does that, how did Shell think its business model would change? FUNK: Well, it was already positioning itself to be heavier in natural gas than it was in oil. And so it assumed that its business would move toward a higher natural gas mix. It had invested in things like the London Array, which is a giant wind farm off the coast of the U. K. It was looking at all sorts of advanced biofuels, things down in Brazil. And at the same time, it didn't think that its fundamental business would change, it would still be an energy company, it would still be an oil and gas company. It would just be one that was perhaps smarter and ahead of the curve than the other one. It basically assumed that regulations would and should come and then at some point its business would be undermined by the fact that the world is worried about climate change, and so it might as well get ahead of this curve. DAVIES: And then there was this other scenario that it's, you know, think tank came up with called Scramble. Well, what the Scramble predict for the world? FUNK: Well, I think the description of it was to say that events would outpace actions in Scramble. That we basically wouldn't do anything about climate change, we wouldn't do anything about the coming energy shortage, that we would sort of just let things happen and we would have a bunch of band-aids. We would scramble for coal when we needed coal and we would scramble to find more oil. And we wouldn't really sort of at a governmental level - or even especially international level - have some sort of way to get to where we need to go in terms of the energy system. DAVIES: And so if that's the world we're heading into, the company sees its business model differently too, right? FUNK: Yeah. I think that means being part of this scramble. Also, sort of trying to gobble up the world's oil, also trying to kind of go ahead and do what they're doing. DAVIES: And so when you looked at what the company is up to and talked to some of its executives, what was your sense of which they see coming true? FUNK: Well, I asked, Jeremy Bentham is the head of their Scenario team now. He's their sort of in-house futurist. And I asked him, is it the view that the Scramble scenario is the one that's come true so far? And he said, yes. Absolutely. That's what's been happening. You know, nothing really happened at the Copenhagen Climate Accords in 2009. They were expecting that the world would come up with a treaty and would start moving toward arresting climate change. There was a push around that same time to do a climate bill in Congress and that died on the vine. And so all these sort of top-level regulatory actions that they thought would push this - push this more blueprintsy(ph) kind of scenario didn't happen. And because of that it, yeah, it does look like a scramble. It doesn't look like any action is being taken at an international or a national level to arrest climate change. And because of that, you know, Shell thinks, well, we're not being regulated in the way we thought we were. This looks more like a scramble. DAVIES: So go get the oil. FUNK: Yeah. DAVIES: McKenzie Funk's book is called \"Windfall: The Booming Business of Global Warming. \" We'll continue our conversation after a short break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, we're speaking with journalist McKenzie Funk. His new book, \"Windfall\" is about new commercial opportunities that have been opened up by climate change. It's called \"The Booming Business of Global Warming. \" Greenland is particularly an interesting case. You traveled to Greenland. Tell us about what you saw there in terms of the effects of climate change and what its - how its future seems to be changing. FUNK: I think Greenland is the most interesting case of all here because it's hard not to root for them. You know, it's a very massive country with a tiny population. It has about 57,000 people and it's beautiful. And then they were longtime, they've longtime been dependent on Denmark, which as colonists goes, been a benevolent country. And yet, Greenland wants to have its own independence. It wants to be in charge of what it does. And they think their path forward is to earn enough money from oil and gas and from mining that they don't have to get their annual subsidy from Denmark. And Denmark says, well, if you can pay your own way you're free to go, you're free to be free. So I went there on a road show with most of the leading politicians in Greenland. In advance of a vote - they were going to have what they call self-governance, which was a degree of independence that they hope will lead to full independence. This involved getting in helicopters, flying from village to village and having meetings with all these citizens who were wondering about this upcoming vote and saying. OK, what's this mean for us? How much money are we going to get from minerals if we do this? Who is going to be in charge of defense? And all the politicians from the main four parties - including the premier - and the leaders of the other parties would sit there and answer questions. And three out of four were very much in favor of this self-governance and eventual independence. Along the way, we spent a lot of time with citizens, you know, your average Greenlanders who by and large didn't seem too concerned with what was happening with climate change. And I don't mean that they were happy about not being able to hunt in the winter, probably because the ice was too brittle, but new fish stocks were moving in and they did seem to want independence. The vote wasn't even close. In some of the villages I went to, I think they voted 97 percent in favor of self-governance. And the country as a whole, it does now have self-governance, which means almost everything but defense is being handled by Greenland itself. DAVIES: And did the citizens of Greenland that you spoke to, and did you see, I mean physical changes in the landscape from climate change? What's actually happening there? FUNK: Yeah, absolutely. The most stark examples where it came from, one fisherman who told me about some new fish species that had freaked everyone out when it appeared five years ago and now it was the basis of their economy. It's because the waters had warmed and the species was moving, moving up. Another friend lived in a village that in wintertime they used to be able to travel to and from a larger city via taxi on the ice. It would get so frozen in the sound that they would have an ice road, it would go to and from and it was much cheaper. And some. . . DAVIES: This was crossing a body of water on a taxi? (LAUGHTER) FUNK: Exactly. Well, which really isn't that scary when they're, you know, 20 feet thick of ice below you. But this, I think two winters ago, they had such a warm winter that there was no ice and they had to get to and from the village they had to take helicopters. It was still too dangerous to do boats because there would be little icebergs and that's obviously horrible. The seal hunters have a harder time because they're going out on the ice. If the ice is brittle, they can't hunt as they traditionally did. But the other big example was one of the mines called the Black Angel. Black Angel has what was once the highest grade zinc in the world and may still be. It did run up in the '70s and then shut down because they thought they'd gotten all the good stuff. And maybe five years ago, some British geologists were out there walking around the defunct mine and they saw that a glacier had pulled back and they sampled some of the rocks below that glacier and they found a zinc deposit just as good as the first one. Just as big. It was enough to open up the mine. And they now have a shipping season that's two months longer to and from that mine because the ice isn't there in the fjord as much. So a very clear case of climate change causing the ice to go away and that helping the local economy. And for Greenlanders who have been very well educated by Denmark and who are remarkably worldly, who have a very good Internet connection and have better fashion sense than I do, you know, these were all good things. They're excited to have their independence. DAVIES: Yeah. Does anybody worry about, you know, having a zinc mine expand? I mean, that may not be the most pleasant neighbor. FUNK: Yeah. And this is a big issue. They just had an election, in fact, and one of the big questions in the election was how much should be endanger our environment which we've depended on forever in order to fund this independence? And there was a big protest vote. A lot of people said, no, we can't just say yes to any oil company that comes. And at the same time, the party that was voted back into power, the prime minister, she's pushing for allowing uranium mining. And that's because that's the way she sees forward to independence. But, you know, they are very aware of the dangers of particularly the zinc mine. That mine had left a bunch of tailings in the fjord before and they said any mine that comes in now, we need to have strong regulations to stop that. They are very worried about the oil companies and about what could happen in a spill. Oil spills are extremely hard to clean up in ice. It's very remote. You know, you can't respond to a spill up there like you could in the Gulf of Mexico. And they're aware of that. But it's a small country and they need money, so I think there's an open question still. DAVIES: We're speaking with McKenzie Funk. His book \"Windfall\" is about commercial interests that see possibilities for profit in global warming. We'll continue our conversation after a short break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR, and if you're just joining us, we're speaking with journalist McKenzie Funk. He has a book about new commercial opportunities that are being exploited with climate change. It's called \"Windfall: The Booming Business of Global Warming. \" You know, one country that's been dealing with rising seas for centuries is the Netherlands, and, you know, you write about some Dutch companies that see opportunities to export their water management technology around the world as the seas rise. And you describe a visit to Rotterdam and this enormous storm surge barrier there. Can you just describe it? FUNK: Sure. You've done well by calling it enormous. It's called the Maeslantkering or Maeslant Storm Surge Barrier and it's these two Eiffel Tower-sized gates. They swing open - or, rather, swing closed and close the Port of Rotterdam which is the most important port in all of Europe. It's where most of the oil and gas come in and most of everything leaves. And they have a huge warning system. It's this computer warning system that says, OK, the tides are surging, we need to close the barrier. And that actually happened for the second time in history late in 2013, just a few months ago. DAVIES: So we're talking about a huge metal gate that's as long as the Eiffel Tower is wide but it moves through the water on hinges so that in effect it kind of closes off the water, closes off the port. FUNK: Yeah. And there's also something that comes up from the bed of the canal there, the passage there. And so it basically just swings closed from both sides and they meet in the middle, these two massive gates. And then this piece comes up from below and it closes it off the entire harbor. Water can't get in, water can't get out. DAVIES: And the company that built this took a look at New York. What would it take to protect New York, right? Now, tell us what they came up with. FUNK: They did. Well, a few companies have worked on these. The company that worked in New York was Aracdis, the Dutch company that made, I think, the most amazing presentation at one of these meetings I went to with a bunch of engineers. And it's basically the Maeslantkering, the Maeslant Barrier, modified for New York. And it would go across the narrows. That's the area below the barriers on a bridge. And it would do the same thing. It would swing closed. Now, that gap across the narrows is actually larger than what they had to span in Rotterdam and, you know, the basic mechanism is the same, though. Storm comes, warning system warns, and the gates swing closed, and Manhattan is protected. DAVIES: And how big would these gates be? FUNK: I don't know the exact numbers but they're, again, we're talking Statue of Liberty or more. And that's just for the gates. I mean, if you've ever driven across the Verrazano Bridge you know that it's a massive span and especially if there's traffic it takes a long time to go across. And these are gates that have to swing across and close most of that gap. DAVIES: And what would it cost, do we know? FUNK: Estimates are pretty varied at the moment but in the order of $10 billion. DAVIES: Right. Now, there's a downside. If you have something like, say, Superstorm Sandy or something worse and a storm surge coming, you close the gates, the gates work. The water doesn't disappear, right? FUNK: Yeah. And I think that that was something that the engineers at Arcadis and in general in Holland they are not slow to point out. I think they're very aware of the fact that when water hits something like this, it spreads out. So if you build gates that block off the Verrazano, then those areas in Brooklyn and Staten Island on either side - on, basically, on the wrong side of that gate - they're going to get a bigger storm surge, I think about two feet or more. It means that you're protecting Manhattan but you're flooding these generally poorer areas on the outside. I mean, it's sort of a metaphor for a lot of these things with climate change. DAVIES: Right. But it's one thing to offer an idea to New York which would save Manhattan at the risk of flooding Staten Island. I mean, that would be politically problematic and they haven't put money into that. Are there places in the world where people have bought the technology and are installing it? FUNK: There are storm surge barriers already in St. Petersburg, Russia. There's one helping protect London. There's - Singapore has something of the sort. There are sea walls outside of Shanghai, although not something quite like this. So - and then of course Venice. That one's quite well known, although that's more because Venice is sinking than because sea levels are rising. But, yeah, these are being installed. Arcadis, this same company we've talked about, has done a lot of work in New Orleans, in fact, on levies and smaller storm surge barriers. And so this, you know, in recent storms it's worked quite well. DAVIES: You know, your book describes, you know, private interests that see a chance to make money from the effects of climate change and sovereign states that appear to be positioned to profit. Do you see either the private interests or the governments deliberately influencing public policy to discourage efforts to halt global warming? Are we seeing people who will, you know, happily destroy the planet to make a buck? FUNK: I have not seen that, no. I think it's an important point to say that the people I have talked to, I don't think they were necessarily bad people. Now, they were looking to make a buck but I don't think many of them were wanting, OK, let's let the planet burn so I can make this buck. It's more that they were sort of hopeless about the prospects. And I don't think there's any lobbying against sort of climate action. But I wouldn't doubt that the fact that many of us are not going to be as bad off as, say, your average Bangladeshi slows action on climate change. There's - the charge levied at, say, Halliburton that it likes war. I always find that a bit dubious. I think that's the same for these companies. I don't think that they like climate change. I think they're looking to make money in it and I think if there was more of their bottom line at risk that maybe they'd be more pro-climate action. Maybe they'd be pushing harder to stop it. But actively working against it, I never saw any evidence of that. No. That, for me, after years working on this book was the major takeaway, was this sort of imbalance, the idea of this unevenness of the effects. You know, some of us will get rich off climate change. Some of us will at least be able to pay for the technologies that can protect us. You know, Manhattan versus Staten Island. That, on a global scale, is pretty important if you want to understand why are we not doing anything about climate change. Sure, there are skeptics but there's also the fact that we in the north and in the west are either going to be fine or even better off, in some rare cases with climate change, or we're going to be able to protect ourselves with these technologies and we can pay for them. But you're not going to see a lot of the world being able to afford a giant $10 billion sea barrier. You're not going to see a lot of the world being able to afford desalination plants to get water if they're running dry. And you're not going to see all the world being able to buy up farmland if theirs goes fallow. And I think that explains a lot about climate inaction and really raises the moral stakes.

I'm Dave Davies in for Terry Gross, who's off this week. On January 9, people in the area around Charleston, West Virginia began showing up in hospitals with nausea, vomiting and eye infections. It was later discovered that toxic chemicals had leaked into the Elk River, just upstream from the main water processing plant. A storage tank owned by Freedom Industries had leaked what is now believed to be 10,000 gallons of a coal-processing chemical into the water supply that serves 300,000 people. They were told not to drink or bathe in the water. Though some people are now using water from their taps, many still don't trust the water or the information they're hearing from public officials. For our guest, reporter Ken Ward, the episode is far more than the story of an accident and a cleanup. Ward says the spill and the sometimes confusing information authorities have provided about the risks to citizens reflect longstanding regulatory failures in West Virginia and across the nation. Ward is a native of West Virginia who's been covering energy and environmental issues for the Charleston Gazette for more than 20 years. He's won many awards, including the Investigative Reporters and Editors Medal and an Alicia Patterson Fellowship. He spoke with me yesterday from West Virginia Public Broadcasting in Charleston. Well, Ken Ward, welcome to FRESH AIR. Let's start with some of the basics about this accident. What was the chemical that was released? KEN WARD: It was a chemical called Crude MCHM, which was sold by a company called Freedom Industries, sold to coal companies for use in the process of cleaning and washing the impurities out of coal before they ship they coal to market. DAVIES: And what were its effects when it got into the water supply? WARD: Well, there was a spill into the Elk River from a storage tank at a tank farm that was a mile and a half up the Elk River from West Virginia American Water Company's regional intake for their water treatment and distribution plant just right here in Charleston, the state capital. And that's a plant that serves about 300,000 people in and around the Charleston area (unintelligible) county area around here. Initially when we heard about this, everyone was giving us the sorts of statements saying, well, there's no threat to public health, everything's fine, keep going, nothing to see here. But by 5 or 6 o'clock that evening, the governor and West Virginia American Water Company had announced a very broad do-not-use order, telling people in that region to only use their tap water for flushing toilets or putting out fires, not to drink it or bathe in it or cook with it. DAVIES: And so this was 300,000 people, roughly, including the state capital, right? WARD: Correct. DAVIES: Now, the company that owned the tank that leaked was called Freedom Industries. Tell us a little bit about what kind of company they are. WARD: A couple of people from Charleston that kind of have a long history of doing some business together, at one point they owned a bar together, one of the people who was previously involved in the company was a convicted felon for some tax charges. Another guy who became involved in the company later on also owns a coal company in Pennsylvania that ran into some problems with federal regulators for trying to circumvent the notion of surprise inspections at their mines. There's been a lot of focus here on whether or not this was a small operation that was run by some people who maybe didn't really know what they were doing or were undercapitalized. The mayor of Charleston, Danny Jones, has referred to them as renegades and outlaws and all of those sorts of things. DAVIES: There was some dispute about exactly how the leak was discovered. I guess the company said it discovered it. Tell us about that. WARD: What we know at this point about how it was discovered is that early that morning, on January 9, which was a Thursday, around 8:00, 8:15 in the morning, some people who live in that part of town called in both to the Metro 911, the county emergency operation center, and to the state Department of Environmental Protection, complaints of an odor, that they smelled some sort of a strong licorice odor in the air. And the Department of Environmental Protection sent a couple of air quality inspectors out, and they kind of went around and sniffed themselves, and apparently it had some previous experience with this particular substance, and we learned later with this particular site. So they kind of had an idea where they thought the odor was going to. So they, these two DEP inspectors went to this - air quality inspectors went to the site, and when they first went there, they were told by company officials, no, we're not having any problems, you know, what are you talking about? They asked to tour the site. The inspectors went out and they noticed that there was a problem at one of the tanks. They described to me a 400-square-foot, three to four-inch-deep pool of this chemical that had leaked out of a hole in the tank, and a four-foot-wide stream of this stuff that was pouring across the containment area to kind of the right angle where the wall and the floor of this containment dike would meet. And it was kind of disappearing into that joint, which apparently had some cracks and it was disappearing into that joint and going down the riverbank into the river. Interestingly enough, the inspectors didn't initially know that it was going into the river because we had had a very cold stretch that week, and much of the Elk River was frozen over, so you couldn't immediately see that it was in the river. But - so the problem that arises from that is that the Freedom Industries had a permit from the state Department of Environmental Protection, a stormwater permit, a permit to govern runoff from its facility. And one of the requirements of that permit was that they immediately report any spills. And the Department of Environmental Protection says they didn't report the spill to the state and that the fact that they didn't report it immediately delayed some efforts at containing the spill and certainly affected the size of it and made the situation worse than it necessarily had to be. DAVIES: So how long did the government advise people not to use this water? When did they get the all-clear? How long did it last? WARD: Well, the do-not-use advisory went out late on a Thursday afternoon, early Thursday evening, the 9th, and it ran through that weekend. And then starting on Monday evening, the following Monday, four days later, the people here started getting these rounds of all clear. There was an Internet map the water company had on its website showing red areas and blue areas, and the blue area map that you were supposed to start flushing the plumbing in your house. They told us to run our hot water for 15 minutes and our cold water for five minutes and our outside spigots for five minutes, and then our water would be OK to use. And that process, they kind of ran through that in zones because they said if everybody tried to flush their pipes all at once, the plant would run out of water, and there wouldn't be pressure for firefighting if there was a fire, or there wouldn't be enough pressure for everyone to flush. And that process ran through, oh gosh, most of that week. It took the better part of a week to kind of get everybody into the blue on the Internet map and get everybody cleared to use their water. The problem was that about the middle of that week, you know, a week into this incident, after a lot of people had been told they could use their water again, all of a sudden the CDC, the Centers for Disease Control, the federal government, and the Department of Health and Human Resources on the state level, both issued this warning saying, oops, by the way, pregnant women shouldn't drink the water at all, even after their do-not-use order is lifted. They should only drink bottled water out of an abundance of caution. So, you know, we don't know whether for three or four days there were pregnant women that were drinking the tap water after being told it was safe, only to find out later there was this warning that they not drink it. DAVIES: Did people get sick? I mean, do we know how many people reported for and received medical attention? WARD: The last numbers I saw, we've been getting these kind of periodically. We've been asking for them every day, and we don't always get them every day, but it was between 450 and 500 people had sought medical attention. The government, when they give us that number, is very insistent on pointing out that none of the people who went to the hospitals were listed in critical condition, as if somehow being critically injured is the test for whether or not something hurt you. You know, we had a member of the House of Delegates, one of the two legislative bodies in our legislature here, who gave a speech saying, you know, our legislature is in town, so all these lawmakers from all over the state are here staying in hotels. And after the water was cleared as OK at her hotel, she took a shower and had a terrible burning of her eyes and developed a terrible eye infection and was out for several days, hospitalized because of this. DAVIES: All right, so people had this licorice smell associated with their water. They don't use it for several days. They're given the all-clear. And then there's this advisory that pregnant women shouldn't still be drinking it. And it raises the question of what do we know about the potential health effects of this substance for MCHM. WARD: Well, Eastman Chemical, which makes it, puts out what's called a material safety data sheet, an MSDS. It's something that's required under the Occupational Safety and Health Act. It's supposed to be kept onsite for workers to look at. It's supposed to be filed with emergency responders and local environmental authorities. It's supposed to, you know, list the properties of the chemical, its flash point, and it's - you know, what's the toxicity of it. And the problem with this particular substance, if you read the MSDS for it, where it lists, you know, toxological effects, you know, is it a carcinogen? No data. Does it cause developmental problems? No data. Most of the basic health effects that you would want to know about, there's no data available, is what's listed on the MSDS for this material. DAVIES: There was a standard, one part per million is considered safe. Did somebody make that up? WARD: Well, that was - I don't know that the one part per million number was really a standard. And I think that the Centers for Disease Control, if it were speaking very carefully, would want to say, well, that's not really a standard because, you know, there's not a water quality standard under the Clean Water Act for this material. There's not a maximum contaminant level under the Safe Drinking Water Act for this material. There aren't any regulatory standards. There's not a limit for how much of this can be put into the water. The one part per million number was something that was devised kind of on the fly by the Centers for Disease Control, the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, the CDC and the ATSDR, you know, the kind of alphabet-soup agencies that deal with these sorts of things. And the first that we heard of this one part per million number was the Friday, the day after the incident, in a very late afternoon press conference with the governor. General James Hoyer, the head of our National Guard, mentioned this one part per million number kind of in passing. And the context was they were being asked, well, you know, what's being done about this, and they were talking about how long they thought it would take for the water company to flush out the plant and flush out all its distribution lines and get things clear so people could flush out their homes. And he said, well, you know, we're not going to start that process until the level reaches less than one part per million because the CDC has told us that was safe. So I started asking, where did that number come from, because it's not on the MSDS sheet, it's not on any government list. Where did this come from? And we had just a heck of a time getting anybody to really explain it to us. At one point I was basically told, well, you know, we're not really going to explain that. It's too complicated, and you might not really understand it. You know, even if you did understand it, your readers might not understand it. And so we don't want to confuse people by trying to actually explain it to them. DAVIES: We're speaking with Ken Ward. He's a reporter for The Charleston West Virginia Gazette. And we'll continue our conversation in a moment. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR, and if you're joining us, our guest is Ken Ward. He's a veteran reporter for The Charleston West Virginia Gazette and has been covering the chemical leak into the water supply of Charleston and the surrounding area earlier this month. So we have a situation where government officials are confronted with, you know, this - 7,500 gallons of this chemical is leaked by a company that doesn't report it. It's discovered. They don't really have hard information about the effects of the chemical. And there is this, you know, don't-use order that's in effect for several days. It's now been lifted. What are folks doing? Are you drinking this water? Are you washing with this water? What are citizens doing in response to the situation now? WARD: Well, we don't really have hard data on that to say, you know, in some sweeping manner. You know, you asked about me. My family and I are not drinking this water. I know a lot of people that aren't. When you go to the grocery stores here, you still see people buying pretty significant quantities of bottled water, filling up their carts. When you go to restaurants, you heard people asking, you know, are you using bottled water or are you using tap water, and restaurants are putting out press releases and they have signs outside saying, you know, we're using only bottled water. And, you know, there was an interesting thing that happened on Monday this week. We'd been getting shipments of water through FEMA that have been handed out by the state and local authorities to people, because, of course, you know, everybody can't afford to go buy bottled water all the time to bathe their kids in. Well, the last of that water was handed out on Monday at our county courthouse here in Kanawha County in Charleston, and there's a little bit of convoluted information. We don't know exactly what's going, that FEMA isn't sending any more, and we don't know if FEMA cut us off or if the state didn't ask for more, exactly what's going on. But very late that day, the governor's office put out a press release and announced that Governor Earl Ray Tomblin of West Virginia had written to FEMA asking for some changes in the emergency declaration that the president had issued to allow a broader reimbursement to state and local agencies for money spent on relief for people during this water crisis here. And there was a very interesting - the letter to FEMA is one of these things where everybody read the press release, and I'm not sure that everybody read the letter that the governor sent to FEMA, but there's a truly - what I think is a remarkable couple of sentences in it I wanted to read. The governor told FEMA: Despite the best efforts of the company and government, many people no longer view their tap water as safe and are continuing to demand bottled water to meet their potable water needs. It is impossible to predict when this will change, if ever. So that's not some flip, off-the-cuff remark that the governor made in a press conference to a reporter. You know, somebody wrote that down and told FEMA that. DAVIES: Before this leak, were you even aware that there was this tank farm upriver that had all these chemicals that could affect the water supply? WARD: Well, I will tell you, when you drive into Charleston on Interstate 79 or 77 coming south into the city, you pass what we call the interstate split, where those two interstates divide. And you see these big white tanks sitting over on the other side of the Elk River, right as you drive into town. And the next thing you see is a big brown building that has letters on it that say West Virginia American Water Company. So I think that it - Kent Carper(ph), a county commissioner here, said, you know, this was a hazard that was - it was hidden in plain sight, and I think all of us, including me and the rest of the media here, probably haven't done a very good job of looking into what was there. DAVIES: Two days after this leak occurred, you wrote about a plan for tougher oversight for chemical use in storage, which was recommended by federal experts and by the U. S. Chemical Safety Board. Now, this was long before this incident. When was that plan offered, and what prompted it? WARD: Three years ago this month, the U. S. Chemical Safety Board first made that recommendation. The Chemical Safety Board has been to West Virginia quite a few times, and they came here in 2008 after an explosion at a Bayer CropScience chemical plant in Institute, West Virginia, which is 15 miles or so to the west and located right next to a historically black college. And there was - there had been a series of terrible chemical accidents at that facility, and this one in 2008 was an explosion that killed two workers. It came very close to damaging a tank that contained methyl isocyanate, MIC, which is the chemical that was involved in 1984 in a terrible disaster at a Union Carbide plant in Bhopal, India. The Chemical Safety Board came in and investigated that and found a lot of problems at the plant and found a dearth of regulation of that sort of a plant, and one of the things the Chemical Safety Board said was that our state, the Department of Health and Human Resources, which is run by the governor, should work with Kanawha, Charleston Health Department to create a new chemical accident prevention program through which government inspectors would more frequently go into these plants, would ensure that they were being operated safely. And the Chemical Safety Board came back again after a series of accidents at a DuPont chemical plant in Bell, West Virginia, which is to the east of Charleston, kind of the other end of the Kanawha Valley, a series of accidents there in January of 2010, ended up with one worker being killed. And the Chemical Safety Board repeated its recommendation after that incident. DAVIES: So what's been the reaction? Has anything happened? WARD: The state has really done absolutely nothing to implement that recommendation. Kanawha County officials have encouraged the state to work with them. The trouble is that the state is the entity which has the authority under West Virginia law to be able to do this. So the state would have to work with the county to do this, and the state has just basically ignored the recommendation. In the last several weeks, since this chemical spill, whenever I've asked anybody from the state were you going to go back and look at that Chemical Safety Board recommendation, they frankly, they look at me like I'm from Mars. DAVIES: Why? WARD: They're either unaware of this recommendation, or they think the notion that they would create a new program to prevent this sort of thing is just ludicrous. DAVIES: So what were the recommendations that, you know, the officials found troubling? Was it hiring more inspectors? Was it demanding more of industry? WARD: Well, the industry officials didn't like the Chemical Safety Board recommendations. They insisted there's enough regulation already and that agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration do enough already. And I think there seems to be this idea that industry pushes, and that some lawmakers push, that somehow these agencies like EPA and OSHA are these jackbooted thugs that are kicking down the gates of manufacturing facilities and stomping out jobs, when in fact a lot of these facilities will go for years and years without ever seeing an OSHA inspector coming in and checking on the workplace conditions, without ever seeing an EPA inspector who's looking at their environmental conditions. You know, the notion that these places are just terribly over-regulated is widely exaggerated. DAVIES: Ken Ward covers energy and environmental issues for the Charleston Gazette. He'll be back in the second half of the show. I'm Dave Davies, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies in for Terry Gross, who's off this week. We're speaking with Ken Ward of The Charleston Gazette about the contamination of the Charleston water supply earlier this month, after an estimated 10,000 gallons of a coal processing chemical leaked into the Elk River. Though authorities now say the water is safe for drinking for all but pregnant women, many of the 300,000 citizens affected by the crisis are still drinking only bottled water. Ken Ward has covered energy and environmental issues in West Virginia for more than 20 years, and he says the episode reflects long-standing regulatory failures in the state and around the country. When we left off, Ward said state officials had failed to implement tougher regulations for handling chemicals at industrial sites recommended by the Chemical Safety Board after a series of accidents. Well, let's look at Freedom Industries, the plant that operated this tank facility that was responsible for this leak; had they seen an inspector in a while? WARD: The Occupational Safety and Health Administration had at one point a few years ago planned an inspection of Freedom Industries. It was a particular sort of inspection that was aimed at looking to see if they had the sorts of accidents or safety conditions that would cause workers to end up losing a limb. But when they showed up at the facility, they figured out that this facility wasn't in the correct industrial sector, so they never went inside and never inspected it. So OSHA had never inspected this facility. It's unclear yet whether EPA ever inspected it. It's unclear, by the way, because EPA generally just won't answer any questions about what's going on here. Initially we were told that the State Department of Environmental Protection had not inspected the facility since 1991. It turns out that they actually have been there more frequently than that and they've done a number of odor inspections, looking at air quality issues, but these air quality inspectors, they're coming in to see if something smells, they're not necessarily going and looking to see if the tanks are leaking. DAVIES: I know that you've written quite a bit about the regulatory environment in West Virginia and nationally. You know, clearly you had a circumstance here where you had a company that maintained a lot of chemicals that could do harm if they leaked - and they did. What were they required to do under existing state regulations? Were there regular inspection reports? Did they have to, you know, submit any kind of particular monitoring? WARD: Under their storm water permit, under the Clean Water Act, it's the permit governing storm runoff from the facility, they were supposed to submit a groundwater protection plan that would detail their - it's exactly what it sounds like - it would detail how they plan to ensure that their operation didn't pollute the groundwater. They were required to submit to the state a storm water pollution prevention plan showing what they would do to prevent storm water polluting the river. And so far the state has not produced copies of those reports. We know that they had a permit, but when I asked state officials for copies of those pollution prevention plans, they just kind of shrug and say, you know, we're looking, we haven't found them yet. So it's not clear that the company ever followed those requirements and it's not clear that the state ever made them. DAVIES: Now, since the accident there have been some proposals in the legislature, the governor has offered a plan to prevent a recurrence of this. Give us a sense of what they're proposing and whether they would be effective. WARD: The governor has proposed a bill that he has touted and his staff have touted as very narrowly tailored to creating new regulatory program for above ground chemical storage tanks. Now, the thing is that the environmental community here is saying, you know, what we really need isn't - they don't mind that bill, they don't think that that bill is a bad thing, but they think that we're not going to really see any kind of change until the tone and the tenor and the rhetoric around environmental regulation in West Virginia changes. You know, West Virginia political leaders are very big on pounding on the table and talking about the Obama administration's war on coal, and how burdensome government regulation is. Now we need to get government off our backs. And you know, the thing about that is, is it permeates down into these agencies - like the DEP. You know, Senator Manchin, who used to be our governor, said a few years ago after the Upper Big Branch coal mine disaster, which killed 29 workers, when information started coming out that that mine was just a mess, Senator Manchin said, well, if that mine was such a mess, why didn't MSHA, the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration, shut it down? And really, the problem with that line of thinking is that if prior to that April 5, 2010 explosion a regulatory agency had shut down a coal mine, my guess is that Senator Manchin would have been pounding his fist on the table complaining that the Obama administration was costing our state jobs. So this hyper-rhetoric against public health and safety regulations really plays an important part in this. And what the environmental community here says is, is until we change that way of thinking, and till politicians stop talking as if they are putting jobs ahead of public safety, then we're not really going to protect the public. DAVIES: Let's talk a little bit about the federal responsibility. You know, I read that there is something like 84,000 chemicals in the United States. What's the state of federal regulation about what kind of information is required about their properties and potential risks? WARD: Well, those things are governed. The safety of chemicals is governed by a law called the Toxic Substances Control Act - TSCA. And it's an old law. Pretty much everyone from the chemical industry to the most strident environmentalist to government regulators agree it's an outdated piece of legislation. When it was passed, it grandfathered in thousand of existing chemicals. And the result of the law really, when you get right down to it, is that a very small minority of the thousands of chemicals that are used in commerce every day and stored at places like Freedom Industries, are really tested adequately to see what their toxicity is and how they should be regulated, or whether they should be allowed to be used at all. And like so many things, that - efforts to kind of reform that law don't really seem to be going anywhere. There's been kind of a renewal that this chemical spill here in West Virginia of that, but it remains to be seen if anybody is going to really, really move on that. Where the rubber hits the road, you can bring a bunch of people together to debate TSCA and, you know, you and I won't understand what the heck they're talking about, probably. But where the rubber hits the road is that people in West Virginia - everyone from me to my neighbors to the emergency response people to our - the director of our Bureau of Public Health - didn't know how bad this stuff might be or might not be. And the reason they didn't know that is because TSCA doesn't work very well. DAVIES: That's the Toxic Substances Control Act. WARD: Yes. DAVIES: What about apart from action by Congress? What authority does the Obama administration have to deal with issues like this and have they used it? WARD: Well, they certainly have broad rule-making authority that EPA and the Environmental Protection Agency can make rules about all sorts of things about this. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration can make rules about these things. You know, one example, you know, the coal industry here likes to complain about how tough the Obama administration is on them. But a few years ago we had a major spill of toxic coal ash from an impoundment in East Tennessee. And the Obama administration promised after that we're going to write new rules to govern toxic coal ash and ensure that it's handled and disposed of safely. Well, they still haven't done that. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration knows that combustible dust is a big problem; they haven't unwritten rules about that. We know that coal miners continue to die in an alarming rate from black lung disease. But the Mine Safety and Health Administration has yet to finalize its promised rule to do something about that. One of the political problems there is that Democrats in Congress don't really want to put the hammer on the Democratic administration's appointees at these agencies and labor unions don't want to do that either. So, you know, inaction by Obama administration agencies, you get a few people in the press that write about it and you get the Chemical Safety Board that points it out, but it mostly kind of goes under the radar. DAVIES: We're speaking with Ken Ward. He's a reporter for \"The Charleston West Virginia Gazette. \" And we'll continue our conversation after a short break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR, and if you're just joining us, we're speaking with Ken Ward. He is a veteran reporter for \"The Charleston West Virginia Gazette. \" He's covered the coal industry and environmental issues for many years. He's done reporting recently on the chemical spill that contaminated the water supply for Charleston, West Virginia and nine other counties. You know, when Governor Tomblin, the governor of West Virginia, was talking to the media about this spill, he made a point early in the crisis that this was not a coal company incident. Why was that such an important point to him? WARD: Well, Governor Tomblin made that point several times. In several press briefings people asked questions that had the word coal in them, and he reacted very stridently, I thought, and was very insistent that this wasn't a coal company. There wasn't a mine anywhere near here. When, you know, I mean the fact is this particular chemical was one that was being brought to that location so that it could be sold to coal companies. The connection with coal was very clear. You know, I think that so many political leaders here are so tied to the coal industry. Not, you know, I don't mean tied in terms of political contributions and those sorts of things. I mean kind of culturally tied. Governor Tomblin is from Logan County, which is a big coalmining community, he grew up around coal mines. Probably most of the people he knows back home, you know, were somehow in the coal business. And I think it's very difficult for West Virginians to kind of break that connection. And, you know, one of the things that always strikes me is when I first started working at The Gazette, when you would talk to coal miners, they would almost to a man say they were doing what they were doing so that their kids could go to college and go do something else. But now kind of the mantra from the coal industry and its public relations machine is that coal is our way of life and it's the only thing we know and it's the only thing we ever will know. Senator Manchin was quoted in The New York Times talking about how we're not afraid to do the heavy lifting in West Virginia. And I think that those kind of remarks leave a lot of West Virginians wondering if dealing with these kinds of spills, is that what he means? We have to suffer these sorts of things in order to have jobs? You know, one of the remarkable things that's happening here that I think isn't being noticed very clearly, certainly by the outside media, is that what people in Charleston - my neighbors and I dealt with for a few days - is what people in coal field communities here deal with every day - not knowing if their water is clean, dealing with black water running out of their faucet, or their well going dry, or what have you. Those are things that people in Boone County and Raleigh County and Mingo County, McDowell County, they live with all of the time. That's not to say everybody there lives with them, but lots of places there, in those communities, people live with those problems. Well, this chemical spill has visited those problems upon a different group of people. Charleston is the state capital, we have a lot of big law firms, we have a lot of lobbying firms, we have a lot of PR firms, and a lot of white-collar people who make their livings off of doing work for the coal industry - be it PR, be it lawyering, be it lobbying, saw what those folks in the coal fields have to deal with. And if you follow some of these, if you look at these folks on social media or you run into them at the grocery store, they're all very concerned now because it's not somebody else's kids, it's their kids. And you know, it's possible that this will be an eye-opening thing for a lot of people, that they'll come to understand that all of this talk about balance between the environment and jobs, that the scales are pretty tilted in one direction sometimes. And you know, that might be something that could change the politics here. DAVIES: We're speaking with Ken Ward. He is a reporter for \"The Charleston West Virginia Gazette\" and has covered the recent chemicals spill that contaminated the water supply of Charleston and nine counties there. You did a piece that looked carefully at fatalities in coal mines and to what extent safety violations were found to be associated with those deaths and what kinds of fines were paid by the coal operators. This was quite a project. You had to build your own database. What did you find? WARD: We did a project after the Sago mine disaster in 2006, when everybody's attention was kind of on mining disasters again, big explosions that killed lots of people. And having tried very hard to keep up with mining deaths over the years, I knew that disasters weren't where the majority of the deaths were, that most miners died, you know, alone. There weren't, you know, satellite TV trucks waiting to see if they got out of the mine alive. It was just, you know, their wife, you know, getting a call in the middle of the night. And so we read - I read the reports for every mining death for a 10 year period and found that nine out of 10 times those deaths were caused by violations by the company - that those deaths were preventable if only the companies that those folks worked for had followed the law. DAVIES: And you looked at what kind of fines people paid for the violations. WARD: It was very small fines. I don't recall the exact number off the top of my head, but it was, you know, it was a couple thousand dollars was the average fine that was paid. You know, and for major coal company those kinds of fines just aren't much of a deterrent. DAVIES: Well, you know, when I looked at it, it seemed that there would be fines of several hundred dollars. But then if the company appealed, the regulators would settle rather than going to court. I think you said it was a median figure of $250 per death. WARD: Well, what tends to happen in these cases is, you know, not just with citations for deaths but almost - you know, this came out after the Upper Big Branch disaster. Mining companies routinely appeal the vast majority of the citations that are issued to them and that ties these citations up in litigation. You know, those are some of the people I'm talking about here when I talk about the people who live here in Charleston who are blissfully unaware of the water pollution that people in the coal fields live with. One of the things those people do is they make their living, you know, defending coal companies against safety violations. So it's often easier for a company to fight that violation than to just fix the problem. DAVIES: You know, you're known as a really dogged investigative reporter and you've won a lot of awards for the reporting you've done on the coal industry and other things in West Virginia. And I have to believe you've had opportunities to move to bigger papers and bigger markets. But you've stayed. Why? WARD: I think that one of the things that I always kind of say to people who offer me those sorts of opportunities is I say well, you know, what are you going to have me do? Can I come there and write whatever I want, whatever I think is important? Can I focus on this or focus on that? And, you know, it always seems like to me at these big papers there's this awesome bureaucracy and there's too much politics. And, you know, I work at this pretty small operation where I can actually go sit down and talk with a couple of my editors about a story that I think is important. And they listen to me and they let me do the things that I think are important. But the other thing is I think that a sense of place is something that's often lost on journalists. You see all these people parachuting in and out of places to do quick-get stories and I have to think that most of those people have their minds made up about what, you know, what the place is like before they get there because they can't possibly have been there long enough to really understand it. And I, you know, will admit that sometimes we in Charleston do a little bit of parachuting like that into other places like West Virginia that we're not from and that we don't really understand. But, you know, I really can't imagine that there are many places in the United States that need good journalism more than West Virginia does. And it's my home. And, you know, if you talk to West Virginians, I think certainly one thing that I'm guessing that Governor Tomblin and I do have in common is that West Virginia is our home and we both love it and don't want to have to leave. And I think that that's why. DAVIES: Ken Ward, thanks so much for speaking with us. WARD: Thank you. DAVIES: Ken Ward is an award-winning investigative reporter for the Charleston Gazette. He's covered energy and environmental issues in West Virginia for more than 20 years. Coming up, Ken Tucker talks about the new music trend known as bro country and reviews two new albums. This is FRESH AIR. DAVE DAVIES, HOST:  This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies in for Terry Gross, who's off this week. On January 9, people in the area around Charleston, West Virginia began showing up in hospitals with nausea, vomiting and eye infections. It was later discovered that toxic chemicals had leaked into the Elk River, just upstream from the main water processing plant. A storage tank owned by Freedom Industries had leaked what is now believed to be 10,000 gallons of a coal-processing chemical into the water supply that serves 300,000 people. They were told not to drink or bathe in the water. Though some people are now using water from their taps, many still don't trust the water or the information they're hearing from public officials. For our guest, reporter Ken Ward, the episode is far more than the story of an accident and a cleanup. Ward says the spill and the sometimes confusing information authorities have provided about the risks to citizens reflect longstanding regulatory failures in West Virginia and across the nation. Ward is a native of West Virginia who's been covering energy and environmental issues for the Charleston Gazette for more than 20 years. He's won many awards, including the Investigative Reporters and Editors Medal and an Alicia Patterson Fellowship. He spoke with me yesterday from West Virginia Public Broadcasting in Charleston. Well, Ken Ward, welcome to FRESH AIR. Let's start with some of the basics about this accident. What was the chemical that was released? KEN WARD: It was a chemical called Crude MCHM, which was sold by a company called Freedom Industries, sold to coal companies for use in the process of cleaning and washing the impurities out of coal before they ship they coal to market. DAVIES: And what were its effects when it got into the water supply? WARD: Well, there was a spill into the Elk River from a storage tank at a tank farm that was a mile and a half up the Elk River from West Virginia American Water Company's regional intake for their water treatment and distribution plant just right here in Charleston, the state capital. And that's a plant that serves about 300,000 people in and around the Charleston area (unintelligible) county area around here. Initially when we heard about this, everyone was giving us the sorts of statements saying, well, there's no threat to public health, everything's fine, keep going, nothing to see here. But by 5 or 6 o'clock that evening, the governor and West Virginia American Water Company had announced a very broad do-not-use order, telling people in that region to only use their tap water for flushing toilets or putting out fires, not to drink it or bathe in it or cook with it. DAVIES: And so this was 300,000 people, roughly, including the state capital, right? WARD: Correct. DAVIES: Now, the company that owned the tank that leaked was called Freedom Industries. Tell us a little bit about what kind of company they are. WARD: A couple of people from Charleston that kind of have a long history of doing some business together, at one point they owned a bar together, one of the people who was previously involved in the company was a convicted felon for some tax charges. Another guy who became involved in the company later on also owns a coal company in Pennsylvania that ran into some problems with federal regulators for trying to circumvent the notion of surprise inspections at their mines. There's been a lot of focus here on whether or not this was a small operation that was run by some people who maybe didn't really know what they were doing or were undercapitalized. The mayor of Charleston, Danny Jones, has referred to them as renegades and outlaws and all of those sorts of things. DAVIES: There was some dispute about exactly how the leak was discovered. I guess the company said it discovered it. Tell us about that. WARD: What we know at this point about how it was discovered is that early that morning, on January 9, which was a Thursday, around 8:00, 8:15 in the morning, some people who live in that part of town called in both to the Metro 911, the county emergency operation center, and to the state Department of Environmental Protection, complaints of an odor, that they smelled some sort of a strong licorice odor in the air. And the Department of Environmental Protection sent a couple of air quality inspectors out, and they kind of went around and sniffed themselves, and apparently it had some previous experience with this particular substance, and we learned later with this particular site. So they kind of had an idea where they thought the odor was going to. So they, these two DEP inspectors went to this - air quality inspectors went to the site, and when they first went there, they were told by company officials, no, we're not having any problems, you know, what are you talking about? They asked to tour the site. The inspectors went out and they noticed that there was a problem at one of the tanks. They described to me a 400-square-foot, three to four-inch-deep pool of this chemical that had leaked out of a hole in the tank, and a four-foot-wide stream of this stuff that was pouring across the containment area to kind of the right angle where the wall and the floor of this containment dike would meet. And it was kind of disappearing into that joint, which apparently had some cracks and it was disappearing into that joint and going down the riverbank into the river. Interestingly enough, the inspectors didn't initially know that it was going into the river because we had had a very cold stretch that week, and much of the Elk River was frozen over, so you couldn't immediately see that it was in the river. But - so the problem that arises from that is that the Freedom Industries had a permit from the state Department of Environmental Protection, a stormwater permit, a permit to govern runoff from its facility. And one of the requirements of that permit was that they immediately report any spills. And the Department of Environmental Protection says they didn't report the spill to the state and that the fact that they didn't report it immediately delayed some efforts at containing the spill and certainly affected the size of it and made the situation worse than it necessarily had to be. DAVIES: So how long did the government advise people not to use this water? When did they get the all-clear? How long did it last? WARD: Well, the do-not-use advisory went out late on a Thursday afternoon, early Thursday evening, the 9th, and it ran through that weekend. And then starting on Monday evening, the following Monday, four days later, the people here started getting these rounds of all clear. There was an Internet map the water company had on its website showing red areas and blue areas, and the blue area map that you were supposed to start flushing the plumbing in your house. They told us to run our hot water for 15 minutes and our cold water for five minutes and our outside spigots for five minutes, and then our water would be OK to use. And that process, they kind of ran through that in zones because they said if everybody tried to flush their pipes all at once, the plant would run out of water, and there wouldn't be pressure for firefighting if there was a fire, or there wouldn't be enough pressure for everyone to flush. And that process ran through, oh gosh, most of that week. It took the better part of a week to kind of get everybody into the blue on the Internet map and get everybody cleared to use their water. The problem was that about the middle of that week, you know, a week into this incident, after a lot of people had been told they could use their water again, all of a sudden the CDC, the Centers for Disease Control, the federal government, and the Department of Health and Human Resources on the state level, both issued this warning saying, oops, by the way, pregnant women shouldn't drink the water at all, even after their do-not-use order is lifted. They should only drink bottled water out of an abundance of caution. So, you know, we don't know whether for three or four days there were pregnant women that were drinking the tap water after being told it was safe, only to find out later there was this warning that they not drink it. DAVIES: Did people get sick? I mean, do we know how many people reported for and received medical attention? WARD: The last numbers I saw, we've been getting these kind of periodically. We've been asking for them every day, and we don't always get them every day, but it was between 450 and 500 people had sought medical attention. The government, when they give us that number, is very insistent on pointing out that none of the people who went to the hospitals were listed in critical condition, as if somehow being critically injured is the test for whether or not something hurt you. You know, we had a member of the House of Delegates, one of the two legislative bodies in our legislature here, who gave a speech saying, you know, our legislature is in town, so all these lawmakers from all over the state are here staying in hotels. And after the water was cleared as OK at her hotel, she took a shower and had a terrible burning of her eyes and developed a terrible eye infection and was out for several days, hospitalized because of this. DAVIES: All right, so people had this licorice smell associated with their water. They don't use it for several days. They're given the all-clear. And then there's this advisory that pregnant women shouldn't still be drinking it. And it raises the question of what do we know about the potential health effects of this substance for MCHM. WARD: Well, Eastman Chemical, which makes it, puts out what's called a material safety data sheet, an MSDS. It's something that's required under the Occupational Safety and Health Act. It's supposed to be kept onsite for workers to look at. It's supposed to be filed with emergency responders and local environmental authorities. It's supposed to, you know, list the properties of the chemical, its flash point, and it's - you know, what's the toxicity of it. And the problem with this particular substance, if you read the MSDS for it, where it lists, you know, toxological effects, you know, is it a carcinogen? No data. Does it cause developmental problems? No data. Most of the basic health effects that you would want to know about, there's no data available, is what's listed on the MSDS for this material. DAVIES: There was a standard, one part per million is considered safe. Did somebody make that up? WARD: Well, that was - I don't know that the one part per million number was really a standard. And I think that the Centers for Disease Control, if it were speaking very carefully, would want to say, well, that's not really a standard because, you know, there's not a water quality standard under the Clean Water Act for this material. There's not a maximum contaminant level under the Safe Drinking Water Act for this material. There aren't any regulatory standards. There's not a limit for how much of this can be put into the water. The one part per million number was something that was devised kind of on the fly by the Centers for Disease Control, the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, the CDC and the ATSDR, you know, the kind of alphabet-soup agencies that deal with these sorts of things. And the first that we heard of this one part per million number was the Friday, the day after the incident, in a very late afternoon press conference with the governor. General James Hoyer, the head of our National Guard, mentioned this one part per million number kind of in passing. And the context was they were being asked, well, you know, what's being done about this, and they were talking about how long they thought it would take for the water company to flush out the plant and flush out all its distribution lines and get things clear so people could flush out their homes. And he said, well, you know, we're not going to start that process until the level reaches less than one part per million because the CDC has told us that was safe. So I started asking, where did that number come from, because it's not on the MSDS sheet, it's not on any government list. Where did this come from? And we had just a heck of a time getting anybody to really explain it to us. At one point I was basically told, well, you know, we're not really going to explain that. It's too complicated, and you might not really understand it. You know, even if you did understand it, your readers might not understand it. And so we don't want to confuse people by trying to actually explain it to them. DAVIES: We're speaking with Ken Ward. He's a reporter for The Charleston West Virginia Gazette. And we'll continue our conversation in a moment. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR, and if you're joining us, our guest is Ken Ward. He's a veteran reporter for The Charleston West Virginia Gazette and has been covering the chemical leak into the water supply of Charleston and the surrounding area earlier this month. So we have a situation where government officials are confronted with, you know, this - 7,500 gallons of this chemical is leaked by a company that doesn't report it. It's discovered. They don't really have hard information about the effects of the chemical. And there is this, you know, don't-use order that's in effect for several days. It's now been lifted. What are folks doing? Are you drinking this water? Are you washing with this water? What are citizens doing in response to the situation now? WARD: Well, we don't really have hard data on that to say, you know, in some sweeping manner. You know, you asked about me. My family and I are not drinking this water. I know a lot of people that aren't. When you go to the grocery stores here, you still see people buying pretty significant quantities of bottled water, filling up their carts. When you go to restaurants, you heard people asking, you know, are you using bottled water or are you using tap water, and restaurants are putting out press releases and they have signs outside saying, you know, we're using only bottled water. And, you know, there was an interesting thing that happened on Monday this week. We'd been getting shipments of water through FEMA that have been handed out by the state and local authorities to people, because, of course, you know, everybody can't afford to go buy bottled water all the time to bathe their kids in. Well, the last of that water was handed out on Monday at our county courthouse here in Kanawha County in Charleston, and there's a little bit of convoluted information. We don't know exactly what's going, that FEMA isn't sending any more, and we don't know if FEMA cut us off or if the state didn't ask for more, exactly what's going on. But very late that day, the governor's office put out a press release and announced that Governor Earl Ray Tomblin of West Virginia had written to FEMA asking for some changes in the emergency declaration that the president had issued to allow a broader reimbursement to state and local agencies for money spent on relief for people during this water crisis here. And there was a very interesting - the letter to FEMA is one of these things where everybody read the press release, and I'm not sure that everybody read the letter that the governor sent to FEMA, but there's a truly - what I think is a remarkable couple of sentences in it I wanted to read. The governor told FEMA: Despite the best efforts of the company and government, many people no longer view their tap water as safe and are continuing to demand bottled water to meet their potable water needs. It is impossible to predict when this will change, if ever. So that's not some flip, off-the-cuff remark that the governor made in a press conference to a reporter. You know, somebody wrote that down and told FEMA that. DAVIES: Before this leak, were you even aware that there was this tank farm upriver that had all these chemicals that could affect the water supply? WARD: Well, I will tell you, when you drive into Charleston on Interstate 79 or 77 coming south into the city, you pass what we call the interstate split, where those two interstates divide. And you see these big white tanks sitting over on the other side of the Elk River, right as you drive into town. And the next thing you see is a big brown building that has letters on it that say West Virginia American Water Company. So I think that it - Kent Carper(ph), a county commissioner here, said, you know, this was a hazard that was - it was hidden in plain sight, and I think all of us, including me and the rest of the media here, probably haven't done a very good job of looking into what was there. DAVIES: Two days after this leak occurred, you wrote about a plan for tougher oversight for chemical use in storage, which was recommended by federal experts and by the U. S. Chemical Safety Board. Now, this was long before this incident. When was that plan offered, and what prompted it? WARD: Three years ago this month, the U. S. Chemical Safety Board first made that recommendation. The Chemical Safety Board has been to West Virginia quite a few times, and they came here in 2008 after an explosion at a Bayer CropScience chemical plant in Institute, West Virginia, which is 15 miles or so to the west and located right next to a historically black college. And there was - there had been a series of terrible chemical accidents at that facility, and this one in 2008 was an explosion that killed two workers. It came very close to damaging a tank that contained methyl isocyanate, MIC, which is the chemical that was involved in 1984 in a terrible disaster at a Union Carbide plant in Bhopal, India. The Chemical Safety Board came in and investigated that and found a lot of problems at the plant and found a dearth of regulation of that sort of a plant, and one of the things the Chemical Safety Board said was that our state, the Department of Health and Human Resources, which is run by the governor, should work with Kanawha, Charleston Health Department to create a new chemical accident prevention program through which government inspectors would more frequently go into these plants, would ensure that they were being operated safely. And the Chemical Safety Board came back again after a series of accidents at a DuPont chemical plant in Bell, West Virginia, which is to the east of Charleston, kind of the other end of the Kanawha Valley, a series of accidents there in January of 2010, ended up with one worker being killed. And the Chemical Safety Board repeated its recommendation after that incident. DAVIES: So what's been the reaction? Has anything happened? WARD: The state has really done absolutely nothing to implement that recommendation. Kanawha County officials have encouraged the state to work with them. The trouble is that the state is the entity which has the authority under West Virginia law to be able to do this. So the state would have to work with the county to do this, and the state has just basically ignored the recommendation. In the last several weeks, since this chemical spill, whenever I've asked anybody from the state were you going to go back and look at that Chemical Safety Board recommendation, they frankly, they look at me like I'm from Mars. DAVIES: Why? WARD: They're either unaware of this recommendation, or they think the notion that they would create a new program to prevent this sort of thing is just ludicrous. DAVIES: So what were the recommendations that, you know, the officials found troubling? Was it hiring more inspectors? Was it demanding more of industry? WARD: Well, the industry officials didn't like the Chemical Safety Board recommendations. They insisted there's enough regulation already and that agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration do enough already. And I think there seems to be this idea that industry pushes, and that some lawmakers push, that somehow these agencies like EPA and OSHA are these jackbooted thugs that are kicking down the gates of manufacturing facilities and stomping out jobs, when in fact a lot of these facilities will go for years and years without ever seeing an OSHA inspector coming in and checking on the workplace conditions, without ever seeing an EPA inspector who's looking at their environmental conditions. You know, the notion that these places are just terribly over-regulated is widely exaggerated. DAVIES: Ken Ward covers energy and environmental issues for the Charleston Gazette. He'll be back in the second half of the show. I'm Dave Davies, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies in for Terry Gross, who's off this week. We're speaking with Ken Ward of The Charleston Gazette about the contamination of the Charleston water supply earlier this month, after an estimated 10,000 gallons of a coal processing chemical leaked into the Elk River. Though authorities now say the water is safe for drinking for all but pregnant women, many of the 300,000 citizens affected by the crisis are still drinking only bottled water. Ken Ward has covered energy and environmental issues in West Virginia for more than 20 years, and he says the episode reflects long-standing regulatory failures in the state and around the country. When we left off, Ward said state officials had failed to implement tougher regulations for handling chemicals at industrial sites recommended by the Chemical Safety Board after a series of accidents. Well, let's look at Freedom Industries, the plant that operated this tank facility that was responsible for this leak; had they seen an inspector in a while? WARD: The Occupational Safety and Health Administration had at one point a few years ago planned an inspection of Freedom Industries. It was a particular sort of inspection that was aimed at looking to see if they had the sorts of accidents or safety conditions that would cause workers to end up losing a limb. But when they showed up at the facility, they figured out that this facility wasn't in the correct industrial sector, so they never went inside and never inspected it. So OSHA had never inspected this facility. It's unclear yet whether EPA ever inspected it. It's unclear, by the way, because EPA generally just won't answer any questions about what's going on here. Initially we were told that the State Department of Environmental Protection had not inspected the facility since 1991. It turns out that they actually have been there more frequently than that and they've done a number of odor inspections, looking at air quality issues, but these air quality inspectors, they're coming in to see if something smells, they're not necessarily going and looking to see if the tanks are leaking. DAVIES: I know that you've written quite a bit about the regulatory environment in West Virginia and nationally. You know, clearly you had a circumstance here where you had a company that maintained a lot of chemicals that could do harm if they leaked - and they did. What were they required to do under existing state regulations? Were there regular inspection reports? Did they have to, you know, submit any kind of particular monitoring? WARD: Under their storm water permit, under the Clean Water Act, it's the permit governing storm runoff from the facility, they were supposed to submit a groundwater protection plan that would detail their - it's exactly what it sounds like - it would detail how they plan to ensure that their operation didn't pollute the groundwater. They were required to submit to the state a storm water pollution prevention plan showing what they would do to prevent storm water polluting the river. And so far the state has not produced copies of those reports. We know that they had a permit, but when I asked state officials for copies of those pollution prevention plans, they just kind of shrug and say, you know, we're looking, we haven't found them yet. So it's not clear that the company ever followed those requirements and it's not clear that the state ever made them. DAVIES: Now, since the accident there have been some proposals in the legislature, the governor has offered a plan to prevent a recurrence of this. Give us a sense of what they're proposing and whether they would be effective. WARD: The governor has proposed a bill that he has touted and his staff have touted as very narrowly tailored to creating new regulatory program for above ground chemical storage tanks. Now, the thing is that the environmental community here is saying, you know, what we really need isn't - they don't mind that bill, they don't think that that bill is a bad thing, but they think that we're not going to really see any kind of change until the tone and the tenor and the rhetoric around environmental regulation in West Virginia changes. You know, West Virginia political leaders are very big on pounding on the table and talking about the Obama administration's war on coal, and how burdensome government regulation is. Now we need to get government off our backs. And you know, the thing about that is, is it permeates down into these agencies - like the DEP. You know, Senator Manchin, who used to be our governor, said a few years ago after the Upper Big Branch coal mine disaster, which killed 29 workers, when information started coming out that that mine was just a mess, Senator Manchin said, well, if that mine was such a mess, why didn't MSHA, the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration, shut it down? And really, the problem with that line of thinking is that if prior to that April 5, 2010 explosion a regulatory agency had shut down a coal mine, my guess is that Senator Manchin would have been pounding his fist on the table complaining that the Obama administration was costing our state jobs. So this hyper-rhetoric against public health and safety regulations really plays an important part in this. And what the environmental community here says is, is until we change that way of thinking, and till politicians stop talking as if they are putting jobs ahead of public safety, then we're not really going to protect the public. DAVIES: Let's talk a little bit about the federal responsibility. You know, I read that there is something like 84,000 chemicals in the United States. What's the state of federal regulation about what kind of information is required about their properties and potential risks? WARD: Well, those things are governed. The safety of chemicals is governed by a law called the Toxic Substances Control Act - TSCA. And it's an old law. Pretty much everyone from the chemical industry to the most strident environmentalist to government regulators agree it's an outdated piece of legislation. When it was passed, it grandfathered in thousand of existing chemicals. And the result of the law really, when you get right down to it, is that a very small minority of the thousands of chemicals that are used in commerce every day and stored at places like Freedom Industries, are really tested adequately to see what their toxicity is and how they should be regulated, or whether they should be allowed to be used at all. And like so many things, that - efforts to kind of reform that law don't really seem to be going anywhere. There's been kind of a renewal that this chemical spill here in West Virginia of that, but it remains to be seen if anybody is going to really, really move on that. Where the rubber hits the road, you can bring a bunch of people together to debate TSCA and, you know, you and I won't understand what the heck they're talking about, probably. But where the rubber hits the road is that people in West Virginia - everyone from me to my neighbors to the emergency response people to our - the director of our Bureau of Public Health - didn't know how bad this stuff might be or might not be. And the reason they didn't know that is because TSCA doesn't work very well. DAVIES: That's the Toxic Substances Control Act. WARD: Yes. DAVIES: What about apart from action by Congress? What authority does the Obama administration have to deal with issues like this and have they used it? WARD: Well, they certainly have broad rule-making authority that EPA and the Environmental Protection Agency can make rules about all sorts of things about this. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration can make rules about these things. You know, one example, you know, the coal industry here likes to complain about how tough the Obama administration is on them. But a few years ago we had a major spill of toxic coal ash from an impoundment in East Tennessee. And the Obama administration promised after that we're going to write new rules to govern toxic coal ash and ensure that it's handled and disposed of safely. Well, they still haven't done that. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration knows that combustible dust is a big problem; they haven't unwritten rules about that. We know that coal miners continue to die in an alarming rate from black lung disease. But the Mine Safety and Health Administration has yet to finalize its promised rule to do something about that. One of the political problems there is that Democrats in Congress don't really want to put the hammer on the Democratic administration's appointees at these agencies and labor unions don't want to do that either. So, you know, inaction by Obama administration agencies, you get a few people in the press that write about it and you get the Chemical Safety Board that points it out, but it mostly kind of goes under the radar. DAVIES: We're speaking with Ken Ward. He's a reporter for \"The Charleston West Virginia Gazette. \" And we'll continue our conversation after a short break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR, and if you're just joining us, we're speaking with Ken Ward. He is a veteran reporter for \"The Charleston West Virginia Gazette. \" He's covered the coal industry and environmental issues for many years. He's done reporting recently on the chemical spill that contaminated the water supply for Charleston, West Virginia and nine other counties. You know, when Governor Tomblin, the governor of West Virginia, was talking to the media about this spill, he made a point early in the crisis that this was not a coal company incident. Why was that such an important point to him? WARD: Well, Governor Tomblin made that point several times. In several press briefings people asked questions that had the word coal in them, and he reacted very stridently, I thought, and was very insistent that this wasn't a coal company. There wasn't a mine anywhere near here. When, you know, I mean the fact is this particular chemical was one that was being brought to that location so that it could be sold to coal companies. The connection with coal was very clear. You know, I think that so many political leaders here are so tied to the coal industry. Not, you know, I don't mean tied in terms of political contributions and those sorts of things. I mean kind of culturally tied. Governor Tomblin is from Logan County, which is a big coalmining community, he grew up around coal mines. Probably most of the people he knows back home, you know, were somehow in the coal business. And I think it's very difficult for West Virginians to kind of break that connection. And, you know, one of the things that always strikes me is when I first started working at The Gazette, when you would talk to coal miners, they would almost to a man say they were doing what they were doing so that their kids could go to college and go do something else. But now kind of the mantra from the coal industry and its public relations machine is that coal is our way of life and it's the only thing we know and it's the only thing we ever will know. Senator Manchin was quoted in The New York Times talking about how we're not afraid to do the heavy lifting in West Virginia. And I think that those kind of remarks leave a lot of West Virginians wondering if dealing with these kinds of spills, is that what he means? We have to suffer these sorts of things in order to have jobs? You know, one of the remarkable things that's happening here that I think isn't being noticed very clearly, certainly by the outside media, is that what people in Charleston - my neighbors and I dealt with for a few days - is what people in coal field communities here deal with every day - not knowing if their water is clean, dealing with black water running out of their faucet, or their well going dry, or what have you. Those are things that people in Boone County and Raleigh County and Mingo County, McDowell County, they live with all of the time. That's not to say everybody there lives with them, but lots of places there, in those communities, people live with those problems. Well, this chemical spill has visited those problems upon a different group of people. Charleston is the state capital, we have a lot of big law firms, we have a lot of lobbying firms, we have a lot of PR firms, and a lot of white-collar people who make their livings off of doing work for the coal industry - be it PR, be it lawyering, be it lobbying, saw what those folks in the coal fields have to deal with. And if you follow some of these, if you look at these folks on social media or you run into them at the grocery store, they're all very concerned now because it's not somebody else's kids, it's their kids. And you know, it's possible that this will be an eye-opening thing for a lot of people, that they'll come to understand that all of this talk about balance between the environment and jobs, that the scales are pretty tilted in one direction sometimes. And you know, that might be something that could change the politics here. DAVIES: We're speaking with Ken Ward. He is a reporter for \"The Charleston West Virginia Gazette\" and has covered the recent chemicals spill that contaminated the water supply of Charleston and nine counties there. You did a piece that looked carefully at fatalities in coal mines and to what extent safety violations were found to be associated with those deaths and what kinds of fines were paid by the coal operators. This was quite a project. You had to build your own database. What did you find? WARD: We did a project after the Sago mine disaster in 2006, when everybody's attention was kind of on mining disasters again, big explosions that killed lots of people. And having tried very hard to keep up with mining deaths over the years, I knew that disasters weren't where the majority of the deaths were, that most miners died, you know, alone. There weren't, you know, satellite TV trucks waiting to see if they got out of the mine alive. It was just, you know, their wife, you know, getting a call in the middle of the night. And so we read - I read the reports for every mining death for a 10 year period and found that nine out of 10 times those deaths were caused by violations by the company - that those deaths were preventable if only the companies that those folks worked for had followed the law. DAVIES: And you looked at what kind of fines people paid for the violations. WARD: It was very small fines. I don't recall the exact number off the top of my head, but it was, you know, it was a couple thousand dollars was the average fine that was paid. You know, and for major coal company those kinds of fines just aren't much of a deterrent. DAVIES: Well, you know, when I looked at it, it seemed that there would be fines of several hundred dollars. But then if the company appealed, the regulators would settle rather than going to court. I think you said it was a median figure of $250 per death. WARD: Well, what tends to happen in these cases is, you know, not just with citations for deaths but almost - you know, this came out after the Upper Big Branch disaster. Mining companies routinely appeal the vast majority of the citations that are issued to them and that ties these citations up in litigation. You know, those are some of the people I'm talking about here when I talk about the people who live here in Charleston who are blissfully unaware of the water pollution that people in the coal fields live with. One of the things those people do is they make their living, you know, defending coal companies against safety violations. So it's often easier for a company to fight that violation than to just fix the problem. DAVIES: You know, you're known as a really dogged investigative reporter and you've won a lot of awards for the reporting you've done on the coal industry and other things in West Virginia. And I have to believe you've had opportunities to move to bigger papers and bigger markets. But you've stayed. Why? WARD: I think that one of the things that I always kind of say to people who offer me those sorts of opportunities is I say well, you know, what are you going to have me do? Can I come there and write whatever I want, whatever I think is important? Can I focus on this or focus on that? And, you know, it always seems like to me at these big papers there's this awesome bureaucracy and there's too much politics. And, you know, I work at this pretty small operation where I can actually go sit down and talk with a couple of my editors about a story that I think is important. And they listen to me and they let me do the things that I think are important. But the other thing is I think that a sense of place is something that's often lost on journalists. You see all these people parachuting in and out of places to do quick-get stories and I have to think that most of those people have their minds made up about what, you know, what the place is like before they get there because they can't possibly have been there long enough to really understand it. And I, you know, will admit that sometimes we in Charleston do a little bit of parachuting like that into other places like West Virginia that we're not from and that we don't really understand. But, you know, I really can't imagine that there are many places in the United States that need good journalism more than West Virginia does. And it's my home. And, you know, if you talk to West Virginians, I think certainly one thing that I'm guessing that Governor Tomblin and I do have in common is that West Virginia is our home and we both love it and don't want to have to leave. And I think that that's why. DAVIES: Ken Ward, thanks so much for speaking with us. WARD: Thank you. DAVIES: Ken Ward is an award-winning investigative reporter for the Charleston Gazette.

The state sits atop one of the world's largest oil deposits. The industry employs some 60,000 workers there, and every day people flock to the Williston Basin, as it's known, looking for work. The boom is also causing growing pains. Long time residents hardly recognize their own home towns. NPR's Kirk Siegler has the first story in our series on the Great Plains oil rush. KIRK SIEGLER, BYLINE: Jennifer Brown is watching the snowy plains of northern Montana pass by outside the frosty windows of the Amtrak empire builder. On a Sunday at dusk, this eastbound train is jam-packed. People are heading to their jobs in North Dakota towns like Minot, Williston and Watford City. Brown is moving there from Idaho to join her husband, who's been working in the oil fields since the summer. JENNIFER BROWN: I haven't seen him in two months. SIEGLER: Are you kidding? BROWN: No. It's been really hard. SIEGLER: The Browns ran a logging truck business in northern Idaho, but work was hard to come by. And out here they've heard you can make a hundred grand or more just starting out in the oil fields. Jennifer Brown says they had no other choice. BROWN: So we've been financially living paycheck to paycheck. We've been married for 20 years, living paycheck to paycheck in that area. So we're going to try something different and basically start all over. SIEGLER: Start all over in this remote corner of Northwestern North Dakota. Just a few years ago that would've been laughable. A hundred grand in wages out here? Believe it. And more and more people like Jennifer Brown are moving here every day. This frozen frontier now boasts the nation's lowest unemployment rate. Help wanted signs are everywhere - in the oil fields, the hotels and restaurants that support them, in construction, hospitals, you name it. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: (Unintelligible) station stop, Williston, North Dakota, will be coming up in about 10 to 12 minutes. SIEGLER: At the heart of it all is the rough-and-tumble boomtown of Williston. The first thing you see leaving the Amtrak station are two strip clubs, Heartbreakers and Whispers, that cater to the wave of men coming into town from the oil fields, their pockets stuffed with cash. Oil workers with the smell of diesel still fresh on their Carhartt overalls also pack watering holes further up the street, downing Buds and burgers after work. Every gas station here has a special on 5-Hour Energy. The local Wal-Mart can't keep its shelves fully stocked. Forty miles to the south, in the once-sleepy farming hamlet of Watford City, a line of trucks clogs snowy Main Street. New hotels, grocery stores and man camps - that's oil-field slang for cheap temp housing - sprout up on the prairie overnight. The 2010 census counted 1,500 people here; today there are an estimated 10,000. A fivefold increase in just over three years. ALICIA DEEDEE: The example I always give people of how it's changed, my little sister and I used to be able to walk all over town. Our parents didn't worry. And I have a daughter of my own, and my husband and I won't let her outside by herself anymore. SIEGLER: From behind the cash register at Larson's Drug, Alicia Deedee says a lot of these changes are bittersweet. While she welcomes the money, she doesn't like all the trucks and the big city traffic and the crime that's come with the boom. DEEDEE: At the same time I'm thankful, you know, we have good jobs and we have jobs. A lot of people in the country don't. SIEGLER: The boom brings money to local coffers while straining infrastructure. Town leaders say they only have enough water to sustain about 7,000 people. Good luck finding a one-bedroom apartment for less than 1,500 a month. And then there's the crime. JESSE WELLEN: Hi. I apologize for being so late. . . SIEGLER: Watford City's police chief Jesse Wellen offers me a seat in his cramped 28 by 28 foot station. His force has also grown fivefold. There are now 10 officers sharing these four desks, but they're usually out on patrol or calls. WELLEN: Our domestic violence calls have definitely increased; alcohol-related calls have drastically increased as well. We seem to go to quite a few assaults. SIEGLER: Wellen says they responded to an unprecedented 18 domestic violence calls in December alone, and his officers are arresting about one person a day now for drunk driving. These are stats nobody in a town of 10,000 people can be proud of. WELLEN: It's basically call to call, I mean instead of kind of a proactive, going out there and trying to get stuff, you're jumping from call to call all the time, crashes and, you know, bar fights. SIEGLER: Chief Wellen, who's 28 and new here, got some help from the state lately and will be able to hire four more officers. Watford City has seen oil booms before, most recently in the 1980s. That boom ended in a bust, and those memories are still fresh for some people here. Still, you get the sense that this boom may be different. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: Ready? UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: We're ready to rock and roll. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: Okay. Here we go. . . SIEGLER: Steve Holen is counting on that, because he has to plan for it. He's the superintendent of the local school district. STEVE HOLEN: We know we are probably in about the second or third inning of a nine-inning game here. Our demographic studies say they'll expect about 1,600 kids by 2017, '18. SIEGLER: Holen is watching a line of kindergartners bundling up in their snow pants, face masks and hats, as school is about to let out. Since 2010, enrollment here has more than doubled to 1,000 kids. HOLEN: And even just today is a good example. We probably picked up another 15 kids today after the post-Christmas little push. SIEGLER: Holen plans to ask voters to approve a property tax hike to pay for building a new high school, but he knows that won't be an easy sell. HOLEN: Some of our community members do believe that the industry, the state, somebody else should be paying for this. It shouldn't be me. And so getting a bond passed in that environment can be a real challenge. SIEGLER: And even if the school bond passes, there's another challenge weighing heavily on Holen's mind. His district has lately had to get into the real estate business. So far it's bought about 20 housing units, but they need a lot more. After all, how do you recruit teachers to come all the way out here to this boomtown when there's no place to live? Kirk Siegler, NPR News. INSKEEP: The oil rush series continues tonight on ALL THINGS CONSIDERED with a report on the tensions between oil production and the state's largest industry, agriculture. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  Hey, this week we're reporting on the drilling boom in North Dakota, which is transforming just about everything it touches. The state sits atop one of the world's largest oil deposits. The industry employs some 60,000 workers there, and every day people flock to the Williston Basin, as it's known, looking for work. The boom is also causing growing pains. Long time residents hardly recognize their own home towns. NPR's Kirk Siegler has the first story in our series on the Great Plains oil rush. KIRK SIEGLER, BYLINE: Jennifer Brown is watching the snowy plains of northern Montana pass by outside the frosty windows of the Amtrak empire builder. On a Sunday at dusk, this eastbound train is jam-packed. People are heading to their jobs in North Dakota towns like Minot, Williston and Watford City. Brown is moving there from Idaho to join her husband, who's been working in the oil fields since the summer. JENNIFER BROWN: I haven't seen him in two months. SIEGLER: Are you kidding? BROWN: No. It's been really hard. SIEGLER: The Browns ran a logging truck business in northern Idaho, but work was hard to come by. And out here they've heard you can make a hundred grand or more just starting out in the oil fields. Jennifer Brown says they had no other choice. BROWN: So we've been financially living paycheck to paycheck. We've been married for 20 years, living paycheck to paycheck in that area. So we're going to try something different and basically start all over. SIEGLER: Start all over in this remote corner of Northwestern North Dakota. Just a few years ago that would've been laughable. A hundred grand in wages out here? Believe it. And more and more people like Jennifer Brown are moving here every day. This frozen frontier now boasts the nation's lowest unemployment rate. Help wanted signs are everywhere - in the oil fields, the hotels and restaurants that support them, in construction, hospitals, you name it. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: (Unintelligible) station stop, Williston, North Dakota, will be coming up in about 10 to 12 minutes. SIEGLER: At the heart of it all is the rough-and-tumble boomtown of Williston. The first thing you see leaving the Amtrak station are two strip clubs, Heartbreakers and Whispers, that cater to the wave of men coming into town from the oil fields, their pockets stuffed with cash. Oil workers with the smell of diesel still fresh on their Carhartt overalls also pack watering holes further up the street, downing Buds and burgers after work. Every gas station here has a special on 5-Hour Energy. The local Wal-Mart can't keep its shelves fully stocked. Forty miles to the south, in the once-sleepy farming hamlet of Watford City, a line of trucks clogs snowy Main Street. New hotels, grocery stores and man camps - that's oil-field slang for cheap temp housing - sprout up on the prairie overnight. The 2010 census counted 1,500 people here; today there are an estimated 10,000. A fivefold increase in just over three years. ALICIA DEEDEE: The example I always give people of how it's changed, my little sister and I used to be able to walk all over town. Our parents didn't worry. And I have a daughter of my own, and my husband and I won't let her outside by herself anymore. SIEGLER: From behind the cash register at Larson's Drug, Alicia Deedee says a lot of these changes are bittersweet. While she welcomes the money, she doesn't like all the trucks and the big city traffic and the crime that's come with the boom. DEEDEE: At the same time I'm thankful, you know, we have good jobs and we have jobs. A lot of people in the country don't. SIEGLER: The boom brings money to local coffers while straining infrastructure. Town leaders say they only have enough water to sustain about 7,000 people. Good luck finding a one-bedroom apartment for less than 1,500 a month. And then there's the crime. JESSE WELLEN: Hi. I apologize for being so late. . . SIEGLER: Watford City's police chief Jesse Wellen offers me a seat in his cramped 28 by 28 foot station. His force has also grown fivefold. There are now 10 officers sharing these four desks, but they're usually out on patrol or calls. WELLEN: Our domestic violence calls have definitely increased; alcohol-related calls have drastically increased as well. We seem to go to quite a few assaults. SIEGLER: Wellen says they responded to an unprecedented 18 domestic violence calls in December alone, and his officers are arresting about one person a day now for drunk driving. These are stats nobody in a town of 10,000 people can be proud of. WELLEN: It's basically call to call, I mean instead of kind of a proactive, going out there and trying to get stuff, you're jumping from call to call all the time, crashes and, you know, bar fights. SIEGLER: Chief Wellen, who's 28 and new here, got some help from the state lately and will be able to hire four more officers. Watford City has seen oil booms before, most recently in the 1980s. That boom ended in a bust, and those memories are still fresh for some people here. Still, you get the sense that this boom may be different. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: Ready? UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: We're ready to rock and roll. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: Okay. Here we go. . . SIEGLER: Steve Holen is counting on that, because he has to plan for it. He's the superintendent of the local school district. STEVE HOLEN: We know we are probably in about the second or third inning of a nine-inning game here. Our demographic studies say they'll expect about 1,600 kids by 2017, '18. SIEGLER: Holen is watching a line of kindergartners bundling up in their snow pants, face masks and hats, as school is about to let out. Since 2010, enrollment here has more than doubled to 1,000 kids. HOLEN: And even just today is a good example. We probably picked up another 15 kids today after the post-Christmas little push. SIEGLER: Holen plans to ask voters to approve a property tax hike to pay for building a new high school, but he knows that won't be an easy sell.

It's called Punta Tombo. Science correspondent Christopher Joyce went there in 2003 for NPR's Radio Expeditions program. He visited a biologist who's been studying the penguins who now says our changing climate is threatening the colony. CHRISTOPHER JOYCE, BYLINE: When I visited Dee Boersma in 2003, she was living in the midst of the world's largest colony of magellanic penguins. And she was worried. Their numbers were dropping by 20 percent that year. You wouldn't have known it, though, on the beach at Punta Tombo. Once you walked over a big dune, it was all penguins. (SOUNDBITE OF PENGUINS)JOYCE: A stunning army of fluffy, two-foot-tall birds. They're also called jackass penguins, for obvious reasons. (SOUNDBITE OF PENGUINS)JOYCE: Nearby was a ragged, double-wide trailer, at the time, Boersma's temporary home away from the University of Washington. DEE BOERSMA: We get to live really close to the penguins. See right here, right underneath the trailer? JOYCE: Oh, there's, there's a penguin right under the trailer. BOERSMA: That's right. And, in fact, last night, there were fights under the trailers. JOYCE: That was Boersma's 20th year at Punta Tombo. BOERSMA: One of the things that I certainly didn't anticipate when I started this is that these penguins could tell us as much as I think they are starting to tell us about the environment. JOYCE: What they were saying was things weren't going well. The colony had shrunk and Boersma didn't know why. She had electronic tags on some penguins, and she knew they were swimming farther than normal to find food. She suspected that something in the environment was changing. BOERSMA: It could well have something to do with the long-term climate changes or the variation in climate changes. JOYCE: It wasn't until around 2010 that Boersma figured it out: bigger, stronger, wetter rainstorms. BOERSMA: When you get three years in a row where lots of chicks die because they get wet, it hits you pretty hard. JOYCE: Now, wait a minute. Penguins swim. They live in cold places. And they were dying from hypothermia after a heavy rain? How can that be? BOERSMA: Chicks are covered in down and they don't get their juvenile plumage. It doesn't even really, you know, come in to protect them at all until they're older than 40 days. So until they get some of their juvenile plumage, they're not waterproof at all. JOYCE: And local weather records showed that things had been changing for years. BOERSMA: There's more rainfall and more of these severe storms. And that's what can kill penguin chicks, if the storm comes when they're vulnerable. JOYCE: And they are more vulnerable. Here's why. Usually, the penguins hatch their young at the same time - over about two weeks in December. But now, for some reason, they're hatching over a six-week period. So the period of time when chicks are vulnerable to storms has increased. Moreover, the hatch is now later in the year, when there are more storms. The penguins are struggling with this new climate. In one year, half the chicks born died in storms. On a few occasions, chicks have also died from heat waves. BOERSMA: It's these climate change events that penguins didn't have in the past, and it's not like penguins can adapt. JOYCE: Boersma published her findings in the journal PLOS One. She got research funding from the Wildlife Conservation Society. The society's South American expert, Martin Mendez, says when things go wrong with wildlife, it's hard to track down the cause. There are so many potential culprits. MARTIN MENDEZ: This show you the value of being on the ground for a long time, especially as it relates to climate change. JOYCE: Boersma has 30 years of data on her colony. Mendez says one other project in the region has that kind of history - in the Patagonian Mountains. There, there's less rainfall on average now. And that's changing the mountain lakes, where Argentina's flamingos live. MENDEZ: And the less water, they become more salty and more suitable for flamingos. JOYCE: For wildlife, a changing climate is a crap shoot. Christopher Joyce, NPR News.

I'm Steve Inskeep. Good morning. This week, NPR News is taking a close look at the North Dakota oil rush. The oil boom is also producing a lot of natural gas, but there's a problem with that. North Dakota does not have the pipelines that are necessary to transport all that gas to market. There's also no place to store it. So in many cases drillers are just having to burn it. NPR's Jeff Brady reports. (SOUNDBITE OF FLAMES)JEFF BRADY, BYLINE: I'm in Western North Dakota just south of Watford City. And that sound you hear in the background, that is a huge flame - bright orange, about 15 to 20 feet high. You see flames like this all over the region. And they burn all day and all night. MARCUS STEWART: People are estimating it's about a million dollars a day, just being thrown into the air. BRADY: Marcus Stewart is an analyst with Bentek Energy, where he tracks the amount of gas burned off - or flared - in North Dakota. His latest figures show drillers are burning about 27 percent of the gas they produce. Stewart says while that percentage has been declining, the overall amount of wasted gas is still rising as more oil wells are drilled. STEWART: I mean it's significant just because we don't really see anything like that anywhere else in the country. BRADY: Part of the problem is the industry's focus. As drillers arrive to tap the riches of the Bakken Shale formation under Western North Dakota, they were looking for oil, not natural gas. Now that they found gas, it's taking time and money to build the pipelines and processing plants to use it. Meanwhile, infrastructure for the oil rush needs to be built too. Oil prices are relatively high while natural gas prices are really low. Ron Ness with the North Dakota Petroleum Council says it's commodity prices that determine where companies invest first. RON NESS: Where would your emphasis be if you've got a barrel of oil that's worth $95 and you've got an MCF of gas, because that's usually kind of the ratio, that's worth $4. 25? Which infrastructure would you build first? BRADY: Ness says $6 billion has been spent on new plants and equipment so far but it's not enough to keep up. Oil industry critics suggest a solution: slow down the drilling boom until that infrastructure is in place. Don Morrison heads the Dakota Resource Council. DON MORRISON: The flaring problem wouldn't have been a problem had we had a state government who was going to make sure that oil was developed in a way that didn't impact the people who live here and the land and the water. BRADY: Drilling in North Dakota is regulated by the state's Industrial Commission, made of up Republican Governor Jack Dalrymple, the attorney general and the agriculture commissioner. Critics say Dalrymple is too cozy with the oil industry, but even the governor thinks burning more than a quarter of the natural gas is a problem here. GOVERNOR JACK DALRYMPLE: That's more flaring than we would like and we are working very, very hard to get the percentage of flaring down. BRADY: An industry task force released a plan this week designed to reduce flaring to 10 percent within six years. Now another interest group is weighing in -royalty owners. These are the people who own the rights to the underground oil and gas. When gas is wasted, they lose money. Some of them have filed class action lawsuits against oil companies. NPR contacted four of those companies but all declined interview requests. Sarah Vogel is one of those plaintiffs and also is a former agriculture commissioner in North Dakota. Vogel owns a farm on the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation. SARAH VOGEL: It is fabulously beautiful and windswept. And we just got electricity last year and running water. (LAUGHTER)BRADY: Vogel says the oil rush has changed her experience. VOGEL: It used to be extraordinarily quiet. And it used to be extraordinarily dark at night. We'd just see the stars. Now at night we see flares. BRADY: Attorney Derrick Braaten is representing Vogel. DERRICK BRAATEN: Essentially the lawsuit is requesting that the royalty owners be paid their royalties on the gas that has been flared. BRADY: Braaten says that could amount to tens of millions of dollars in gas that is now just being wasted amid North Dakota's rush for oil instead. Jeff Brady, NPR News.

The proposed Keystone XL pipeline cleared another hurdle today with this assessment: There are a lot of environmental impacts associated with the crude oil from the tar sands in Alberta, Canada, but the pipeline would not necessarily make them worse. That's the conclusion of the State Department's final report on the environmental impact of the proposed pipeline. The Keystone would carry crude from Alberta to refineries in Texas. NPR's Elizabeth Shogren has been looking at the report. ELIZABETH SHOGREN, BYLINE: The Keystone XL has been so contentious because the kind of oil it would carry has a significantly bigger greenhouse gas footprint. To produce it, companies scrape the tarry stuff out of the Earth with huge machines or inject steam under ground to force it out. The State Department says because it take so much energy to produce the stuff, in the end, this fuel releases 17 percent more greenhouse gases than the average crude. Still, Assistant Secretary of State Kerri-Ann Jones says rejecting the pipeline won't stop the oil from getting to market. KERRI-ANN JONES: Approval of any single project is unlikely to significantly affect the rate of extraction of the oil from the oil sands or the refining of heavy crude oil on the U. S. Gulf Coast. SHOGREN: That's because the oil could travel by rail or through another pipeline. This key conclusion is part of an environmental assessment that fills 11 volumes. There are other environmental impacts. The assessment says this heavy oil is harder to clean up when it spills. The Kalamazoo River in Michigan is still being dredged three and a half years after a big pipeline spill of this heavy crude. But the big issue is greenhouse gases. President Obama has said the project won't go ahead if it significantly exacerbates the problem of carbon pollution. The assessment ends more than five years of environmental research. But Jones says it leaves many questions unanswered. JONES: The broader question about how the decision on this pipeline would fit with our broader national and international efforts to address climate change. SHOGREN: Environmental groups are scrambling to review the assessment. But they were encouraged by changes from previous ones. MICHAEL BRUNE: The State Department is saying that the oil is both more toxic and more corrosive, as well as more carbon intensive than conventional oil. SHOGREN: Michael Brune is the executive director of the Sierra Club. BRUNE: And so this is a document that actually gives Secretary Kerry complete latitude. SHOGREN: Secretary Kerry will also weigh other factors such as energy needs and national security to determine if the pipeline is in the country's interest. There's no deadline for Kerry's decision.

SHOGREN: Secretary Kerry will also weigh other factors such as energy needs and national security to determine if the pipeline is in the country's interest. There's no deadline for Kerry's decision.

I'm Guy Raz. And on the show today, the end of privacy. So John Wilbanks believes that we will all be a lot healthier and that we could potentially conquer big diseases like cancer if we just stop obsessing so much about medical privacy. And start to understand that the things that were designed to protect our privacy are actually making medical breakthroughs a lot harder to achieve. And it starts with a concept called informed consent. Here's John's explanation from the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)JOHN WILBANKS: Informed consent is an idea that we should be very proud of as a society, right. It's something that separates us from the Nazis in Nuremberg and forced medical experimentation. It's the idea that agreement to join a study without understanding isn't agreement. It's something that protects us from harm, from hucksters, from people that would try to hoodwink us into a clinical study that we don't understand or that we don't agree to. And so you put together the thread of narrative, hypothesis, experimentation in human and informed consent and you get what we call clinical study. And it's how we do the vast majority of medical work. It doesn't really matter if your in the north, the south, the east, the west. Clinical studies form the basis of how we investigate. So if we're going to look at a new drug, right, we test it in people. We draw blood, we do experiments and we gain consent for that study to make sure that we're not screwing people over as part of it. And the way we gain informed consent - this tool that was created to protect us from harm - now creates silos. So the data we collect for prostate cancer or for Alzheimer's trials goes into silos where it can only be used for prostate cancer or for Alzheimer's research, right. It can't be networked. It can't be integrated. It cannot be used by people who aren't credentialed. So a physicist can't get access to it without filing paperwork. A computer scientist can't get access to it without filing paperwork. And this is an accident. These are tools that we created to protect us from harm, but what they're doing is protecting us from innovation now. What really depresses me is that all these studies on prostate cancer and all these studies on skin cancer can't be combined. The answer to prostate cancer may be in skin cancer and vice versa. We don't know. I mean, the chief argument for sharing this information, to me, is the ability to make unanticipated discoveries. RAZ: And this is all because of our misreading of privacy? WILBANKS: Privacy is a piece of it. It's an attempt to protect us from harms that are far less potent than the benefits that we could receive. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)WILBANKS: And that wasn't the goal. It wasn't the point, right. It's a side effect, if you will, of a power we created to take us for good. We cannot take the information from past trials and put them together to form statistically significant samples. And that sucks, right. So 45 percent of men develop cancer. Thirty-eight percent of women develop cancer. One in four men dies of cancer. One in five women dies of cancer, at least in the United States. And three out of the four drugs we give you, if you get cancer, fail. And this is personal to me. My sister is a cancer survivor. My mother-in-law is a cancer survivor. Cancer sucks. And when you have it, you don't have a lot of privacy in the hospital. You're naked the vast majority of the time. People you don't know come in and look at you and poke you and prod you. And when I tell cancer survivors that this tool we created to protect them is actually preventing their data from being used, especially when only three to four percent of people who have cancer ever even sign up for a clinical study, their reaction is not thank you, God, for protecting my privacy - it's outrage that we have this information and we can't use it, and it's an accident. So the cost in blood and treasure of this is enormous - 226 billion a year is spent on cancer in the United States, 1,500 people a day die in the United States, and it's getting worse. RAZ: So how would that change, you know, if, like, more of that information was available to researchers, like, if more of that data from cancer patients wasn't kept behind walls? WILBANKS: What I hope would happen is that we would be able to find some of the patterns that are driving cancer. And we're studying it in such small sample sizes right now. You know, when we have to go out and enroll people with skin cancer, it costs, anywhere from $500 to $5,000 per patient just to enroll them in the study. And at the same time, we've got, you know, tens of thousands of people a day with melanoma and others kinds of skin cancer about whom very valuable data is being generated that could form a natural study. And we're basically throwing that data away. And so what I'm hoping we could do is is basically explode the number of people who participate in clinical studies by not having them be forced to enroll in some sort of complex study that they see on the subway, but be able to join a clinical study by routing a copy of their data to someone doing the research. RAZ: But, I mean, if more of this medical data was available and, like, easy to combine and cross reference, I mean, do you think we would have made, like, more progress on finding out better treatments for cancer and other diseases? WILBANKS: I do. I do. At a minimum, we'd be able to figure out who shouldn't be taking cancer drugs. Cancer drugs have an astonishingly high failure rate, right. Anywhere between 50 percent and 80 percent of the time when we give a cancer drug to a person, all they get is the toxicity. If we knew, right, what the genetic variation were of those people and we could run complex math on it like we run on NSA data, like we run on Google data, like we run on Amazon data, we could probably come up with a list of a thousand rare variations that strongly correlate with the drug failing. RAZ: So you want people to give this information over voluntarily like they give information over to Facebook or any other social media platform. WILBANKS: I do. But I want them to have more agency involved in the decision. And what I want is for people with their eyes open, right, understanding the choice they're making to begin contemplating whether or not to make the choice to share. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)WILBANKS: So the thing that I'm proposing we do here is that we reach into our bodies and we grab the genotype. And to reach into the medical system and we grab our records, and we use it to build something together, which is a commons. We do it voluntarily. We do it through standardized legal tools. We do it through standardized technologies, right. That's all a commons is. It's something that we build together because we think it's important. So that's what I do. I've actually started what we think is the world's first fully digital, fully self-contributed, unlimited in scope, global in participation, ethically approved clinical research study where you contribute the data. And you can actually upload your information and have it syndicated to the mathematicians who will do this sort of big data research. And the goal is to get a hundred thousand in the first year and a million. . . RAZ: OK, this sounds incredible, right. But, I mean, you could see how all that information could be abused, right, 'cause, like, information is control. WILBANKS: Right. There are all sorts of great science fiction scenarios for the bad things that could happen if your genetic information becomes available. And I don't particularly think that those are very likely. I worry more about bullying. I worry more about trolling 'cause these are things that we know people do anyway. And that's why it's so important not to take the informed consent issue and throw it out with the bathwater, but to find a way to harmonize it so that the people who are in this vast database, about whom we're collecting lots of information, understand and agree to the risks that they're running. And so one of the great ironies, to me, of the Snowden era is that it has illustrated the value of meta-data to people that aren't nerds. The exact same thing that makes you identifiable makes your data scientifically valuable. RAZ: John Wilbanks. He's on a crusade to change medical research.

I'm Melissa Block. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: And I'm Audie Cornish. Now, the strange story of Tyrone Hayes. The biologist has devoted much of his career to studying a common herbicide used on corn, called atrazine; specifically, its effects on amphibians. Hayes believes the chemical impedes the sexual development of frogs, and he's publicly argued against the use of atrazine and criticized the corporation that makes it, Syngenta. For years, Hayes told friends and colleagues that because of his opposition, Syngenta was also waging a campaign against him - monitoring his correspondence, following him to speaking engagements, and trying to undermine him in public, even investigating his wife. Now, some of his colleagues believed him, others thought he was losing his grip. The story unfolds in this week's New Yorker magazine. We're joined now by reporter Rachel Aviv. And Rachel, let's start briefly at the beginning. Give us a sketch of who Tyrone Hayes is, and how he first crossed paths with Syngenta. RACHEL AVIV: So Tyrone Hayes is a scientist at Berkeley, a professor in the integrative biology department at Berkeley. And he studies the endocrinology of amphibians, and he was asked in the late '90 by Syngenta to examine atrazine and its ecological effects. And he did experiments that showed that atrazine caused tadpoles to develop both ovaries and testes. He called these frog hermaphrodites. And his relations with Syngenta became strained once he reported these results. And eventually, he resigned from the job; and he accused Syngenta of stalling his research, of trying to critique trivial aspects of his work. And in his resignation letter, he said that he was worried that his colleagues would think he had been part of a plan to bury important data. CORNISH: And the relationship between Hayes and Syngenta, it's not just strained, right? It gets much, much worse. Tyrone Hayes comes to think he's essentially under surveillance from the company. What kinds of things is he doing to avoid that? Why does he come to believe that? AVIV: He starts to notice at conferences that he attends there is someone in the audience dressed a little bit better than everyone else, and this person is asking questions that cast doubt on the credibility of his work. And he also begins to think that other scientists are remembering events differently than he does. So he begins to carry an audio recorder. And eventually, he starts to tell his colleagues that he thinks Syngenta is orchestrating a campaign to destroy his reputation and is trying to figure out his vulnerabilities so they can exploit them. CORNISH: Now, soon, it seems as though Tyrone Hayes falls in that category of people who say, you know, just because you're paranoid doesn't mean they're not out to get you, right? In 2012, two massive class action lawsuits around atrazine reveal hundreds of internal Syngenta documents that shed light on their side of Tyrone Hayes' story. What did they reveal? AVIV: The documents showed that Syngenta was probably just as preoccupied by Hayes as he was by them. They had drafted a list of goals, and the first was to discredit Hayes. They had also created a long list of possible methods for discrediting him; and that included investigating his wife, investigating his funding, conducting third-party audit of his research, asking the journals where he published to retract his papers, and conducting what they called systematic rebuttals of all of his public appearances. CORNISH: And if you do an Internet search of Hayes, you turn up this world of conflicting information - of studies and counter studies - even though lots of other people were doing similar research, correct? AVIV: Mm-hmm. The first thing that pops up when I do a search is Tyrone Hayes: not credible. And there are notes taken by Syngenta's public relations staff that explicitly recommend purchasing \"Tyrone Hayes\" as a search word on the Internet so that when people search for his research, they can control what we see. CORNISH: Now, stepping back for a moment, in your article, you write that this is reflective of a much broader kind of campaign, the sound science movement. Talk a little bit about what that means, and what that involves. AVIV: One of the interesting things is, I think that industries have recognized that if they want to delay regulation on a particular product, it is more effective to critique the science rather than to get into a debate about the policy. And what has been named the sound science campaign is this effort to delay regulation by kind of picking apart the science that would be used to support the regulation. CORNISH: Would you talk about - meaning their paid studies, right? - to consultants, to people who write op-eds. Is that a part of this? AVIV: So Syngenta had a - what they called a list of supportive third-party stakeholders. And these were people - they were scientists, journalists, writers, directors of nonprofits - who could be called upon to defend atrazine. In some cases, the public relations staff of Syngenta would write editorials and then give them to these third-party allies, as they called them. The third-party allies would sign the editorials, and then they would be placed in regional newspapers. In that sense, they looked like journalism rather than public relations documents. CORNISH: Critics of what you're saying would argue that, what's wrong with higher standards? You know, if you're going to regulate something, why not make sure that the science is sound, and that every method is the right one? I mean, what do you say to that? AVIV: I think at some point, there has to be an acknowledgement that the science is never going to be ideal. We can only get so far, particularly when we're looking at the effects of chemicals on humans - because we can never test them in the perfect way, which would be to feed the chemical to humans and see what happens. So there's always going to be this zone of uncertainty. And I think that the way that Europe has dealt with this is to acknowledge that when there's - when we reach a certain degree of uncertainty, maybe we should slow down whereas in the U. S. , the general approach has been to keep going until we have absolute proof that a chemical has harms. CORNISH: In the end, where do things stand with Professor Hayes, with Syngenta? AVIV: Syngenta is - now, the EPA is conducting another review of atrazine, this coming year. And Hayes is still giving all of his lectures - 50 lectures a year. But he is doing it, I think, with the knowledge that he is not this paranoid extremist. He - his fears were real. CORNISH: Rachel Aviv, thanks so much for talking with us. AVIV: Thank you for having me. CORNISH: Rachel Aviv is a staff writer with The New Yorker.

AMIN AZZAM: I think it's important to acknowledge that there's a lot of information on Wikipedia in the medical space or the health care space that is currently still low quality, lots of gaps in the information or lots of sentences that are unreferenced. So we don't know if somebody has just merely put that there because they believe it or because there's scientific knowledge behind it. So there is a lot of room for improving the quality of Wikipedia, particularly in the medical domain. We're sort of latecomers to Wikipedia. RATH: Why do you think that is? AZZAM: I think it's because in the health care community, we're used to learning from wisened professors above us. And those generations above us didn't look favorably on Wikipedia or social media or even the concept of crowdsourcing as the wisdom of the crowd. So my generation absolutely pooh-poohed Wikipedia, and now I'm finding that all my med students go there first because it's written in a way they can understand as they are learning to become doctors. RATH: What were some of the examples of bad medical information on Wikipedia? AZZAM: This came from one of my former medical students who first adjusted the idea to me over a coffee. An example that he used was that a friend asked him about when you go and get an HIV test, how long could it possibly be a false negative result? And so he looked that up on Wikipedia and saw a number, and then looked it up in a more reliable medical source and saw that those two were not in agreement with one another. So he went and fixed it on Wikipedia immediately. So that's an example of where the quality of information that is or was then on Wikipedia was inaccurate. RATH: Now, this being Wikipedia, isn't the problem, though, that just any old person could come on then and take down that good information and put up bad stuff? AZZAM: That's true, and I think that's the double-edged sword of Wikipedia. Because anyone can edit, we don't necessarily know the expertise of the people doing the editing. On the other hand, the reason it's so popular is because everyone can contribute. What I think we're doing is bringing medical students who have a certain amount of expertise to the table to be adding to the wisdom of the crowd, if you will. They have certain (unintelligible) knowledge so they're reading other reliable sources and adding information that's missing from the Wikipedia pages. But, for example, if we think about a diagnosis that has a list of symptoms, when the students would write those symptoms, they may add the missing symptoms. Then they had to think, well, what order shall we put the symptoms list - should it be most serious first, should it be alphabetical, should it be most common first? And those kinds of decision-making things are where their emerging expertise, I think, adds value. It's not just adding references and not just improving the gaps, but thinking about how to make it more readable and more digestible for the people that are reading Wikipedia. RATH: That's Dr. Amin Azzam. He teaches a course at the University of California, San Francisco, that enlists knowledge of medical students to improve Wikipedia. Amin, thank you. AZZAM: My pleasure. ARUN RATH, HOST:  You're listening to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR West. I'm Arun Rath. It's hard for me to imagine life without Wikipedia, and I'm not alone. It's the sixth most visited Web page on the planet. Along with everything else, Wikipedia has become a major source of medical information. A recent study names Wikipedia as the single leading source of health care information for both patients and their doctors. Unfortunately, some of that information is wrong. Dr. Amin Azzam is a professor of psychiatry at the University of California, San Francisco. He teaches a course that encourages medical students to use their knowledge to improve Wikipedia, one article at a time. DR.

I'm Arun Rath. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: The debate is settled. Climate change is a fact. And when our children's children look us in the eye and ask if we did all we could to leave them a safer, more stable world with new sources of energy, I want us to be able to say, yes, we did. (APPLAUSE)RATH: President Obama from the State of the Union address. Of course, in politics, and it seems especially when it comes to climate change, talk is cheap. Climate change or global warming, as we used to call it, has been part of our national discussion for over 20 years. But with today's political polarization and divided government, it seems harder than ever for the government to actually do anything. That's our cover story today: With the president and Congress at odds over how to address climate change, where does that leave the American people? (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RATH: The president has made it clear that he intends to set strict limits on power plant emissions through the Environmental Protection Agency. Republicans in Congress have made it clear that they want to find a way to stop that. But NPR White House correspondent Scott Horsley says the president is already moving forward with another part of his plan without help from Congress. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: The president's plan is partly about reducing changes to the Earth's climate mainly by cutting back on greenhouse gases, but it's also about adapting to those changes we can't stop. And that means getting more resilient to floods or droughts or wildfires or invasive insects, all the sort of biblical plagues that come along with climate change. And this week, his Agriculture secretary announced a creation of seven climate hubs around the country. These will be national research centers that will focus on helping farmers and ranchers and others in rural communities to cope with climate change. RATH: Of course, we've heard Republicans are not on board with most of the president's plan, most notably his intention to impose stricter regulations on power plant emissions. So are we headed toward a political showdown on this issue? HORSLEY: Well, it doesn't look as if Congress itself is going to tackle climate change. So one of the big tools in the president's toolbox now is the EPA. And that agency has been working on rules that would limit carbon pollution from power plants, especially coal-fired plants. They're responsible for about 40 percent of the greenhouse gases in this country. So there will be a fight over those rules, which the president wants to see finalized next year. The EPA is acting under the Clean Air Act, so it doesn't take affirmative action by the Congress to authorize this. But the critics in Congress will try to challenge that. Perhaps more importantly, the EPA authority's being challenged in the Supreme Court, and the high court is set to hear arguments later this month. RATH: NPR's White House correspondent Scott Horsley. Thanks, Scott. HORSLEY: My pleasure. RATH: One of the congressmen leading the fight against regulating power plants is Ed Whitfield, Republican representative from Kentucky. He says just because climate change is real shouldn't mean the government can hit power companies with overly strict regulations. REPRESENTATIVE ED WHITFIELD: We have legislation that's been reported out of the Energy and Commerce Committee that basically says to EPA when you set the emission standards, you have to set a standard that has been adequately demonstrated in the marketplace. RATH: His proposal would prevent the EPA from setting drastically lower emission standards for coal-fired power plants. He says the president's plan to limit carbon emissions is rash and will hurt the economy. WHITFIELD: He is moving quickly to transform the way electricity can be produced in America at a time when we do not have enough renewable power to come close to meeting the requirements. RATH: That's Congressman Ed Whitfield of Kentucky. In Washington, the debate over what to do about climate change is split largely down party lines. But it hasn't always been that way. Senator John McCain actually campaigned on the issue in his presidential runs. Here he is in 2007. (SOUNDBITE OF POLITICAL AD)RATH: Climate change was on the country's mind that spring because deadly storms were ripping through the Midwest. (SOUNDBITE OF NEWS REPORTS)RATH: The worst tornado came on the night of May 4, 2007. It was the most intense storm of a season that itself was the worst in 50 years. (SOUNDBITE OF NEWS REPORT)MAYOR BOB DIXSON: Oh, tornado to the east. Huge tornado. Look at that. RATH: Bob Dixson is a longtime resident of Greensburg, Kansas. He remembers that night vividly. DIXSON: On May 4, 2007, at 9:40 at night, we lost everything, my wife and I, as did everyone in town. Our home was sucked off the top of the foundation. And there was no walls, there was no floor. We were in the basement, and it just took everything. What we had left was the clothes we had on our back. It's those little intrinsic things that you lose like family recipes, like heirlooms. RATH: Eleven people died, and 95 percent of the town was destroyed. In the aftermath of the storm, some people said the town itself was one of the casualties. Bob Dixson didn't think so. He ran for mayor, promising to rebuild the town. Now, Dixson is a Republican, but his approach: attack climate change head-on. His plan: rebuilt Greensburg green to make it a safe, sustainable city. He won the election in a landslide. Now halfway through his second term, Dixson has delivered. Greenburg has a new hospital and a new school built using sustainable architecture. There are wind turbines and solar panels all over town. DIXSON: Well, right off the bat - and I'm going to be very candid with you and especially with me - whenever I hear the term green, all I could think of was the liberal left wing, new age movement that we in rural America felt was just not appropriate. But when we drilled down closer to it and looked at everything, we realize that our heritage and our ancestors was based on those sustainable green principles. Our grandparents and our parents always taught us if you take care of the land, it will take care of you. RATH: People obviously would want to know looking at Greensburg why you've been able to have this be less of a partisan debate. Is it as simple as the fact that you've experienced that extreme weather that was so devastating? DIXSON: Well, it banded us together. You can build the greenest community in the world. You can eliminate as much carbon emissions as you want. But if you don't have the people to inhabit that community and a vibrant economy that they can live and work and feed their families, you're not a sustainable community. RATH: Did you feel like these policies put you at odds with national Republicans - with, say, Republicans in Congress? DIXSON: We perceive certain things when we hear Republican or Democrat - preconceived ideas of what Republicans and Democrats think on issues - when, in fact, it should come down to what do we as citizens think about these issues, not what we're being told, but what we've investigated and how they can be implemented at the lowest level possible, which is our local level. It's about us as a society surviving and the ability to endure, and that's what true sustainability is. RATH: Bob Dixson is the Republican mayor of Greensburg, Kansas. He's also one of the local leaders on the president's Task Force for Climate Preparedness. The U. N. panel on climate change warns storms will continue to get more severe and more frequent. Mayor Dixson is hoping Greenburg's approach can be instructive to other communities across the county as they brace for more extreme weather.

That's an acoustic wave you can actually hear. ELLSWORTH: The other wave is called the S-wave, or shear wave. It's the wave that carries most of the energy and it's the one that we typically feel.

They mate for life, sharing nest-building duties, and they share an equal role in raising their young. It looks a lot like a relationship many of us would like to have. Prairie voles have long been of interest to scientists, looking at the neurobiology of bonding and monogamy. Larry Young is one of those scientists, from the Yerkes National Primate Research Center in Atlanta, Georgia. He joins me now. Welcome to the program, Larry. LARRY YOUNG: Thank you. MARTIN: Let's start with the courtship phase of this relationship. What happens when a male prairie vole spots an eligible female? YOUNG: Well, the first thing he has to do is to get her interested in him and he does that by kind of just courting her. And the smell of her pheromones gets her brain activated and she starts turning out steroid hormones, like estrogen. And after about 24 hours she's ready to mate. MARTIN: OK. So, in the wild, prairie voles don't have a long life expectancy. But in the lab, where they're under the conditions where they can have longer lives, I understand that bond is strong enough to keep them together for a long time. YOUNG: Absolutely. They'll stay together for the rest of their life, which in the lab is around two or three years. But even in the wild, they're known as the potato chip of the prairie because they are preyed upon by hawks and other things. But, you know, they can live for a year or so. And in about 80 percent of the cases where a male or a female loses their partner, they never take on another partner. So, they really do stay together for life. MARTIN: Wow. That's amazing. They're not always faithful though. YOUNG: Yes. Actually, this is one of the features that actually I think makes it an even better model for humans than you might think. Because even though they are together, if a male is wandering through the prairie and a female who's in estrous comes by, he may mate with her. But the important thing is he comes back to his partner at night. And that's what we're really studying here. We're studying the bond between the two. MARTIN: That's not enough, Larry. That's not enough. . . YOUNG: I'm sorry. That's. . . MARTIN: . . . to just come home. (LAUGHTER)YOUNG: . . . that's the best that we can do with these animals. And in fact, most monogamous species - only about 3 percent of mammals exhibit this kind of monogamy. But in almost all of those species, there is some cheating that occurs. MARTIN: Does all this mean that one day there will be some kind of infidelity vaccine? I mean, is that possible? Is that why you're studying the voles? YOUNG: No, we're not studying the voles to try to find an infidelity vaccine or even a love vaccine. No, I think the importance of this work is, you know, if we understand the biology underlying relationships, maybe we can help get better ideas about how to improve those relationships, how to change our behaviors to help spark that neurochemistry in our brain that will help us maintain lifelong relationships with our partner. MARTIN: A lot to learn from the romantic patterns of voles. Larry Young. He's the author of \"The Chemistry Between Us. \" Thanks so much for talking with us, Larry. YOUNG: Thank you for having me. It's been wonderful. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)MARTIN: This is NPR News. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:  Most mammals have love 'em and leave 'em relationships, but not the prairie vole. They mate for life, sharing nest-building duties, and they share an equal role in raising their young. It looks a lot like a relationship many of us would like to have. Prairie voles have long been of interest to scientists, looking at the neurobiology of bonding and monogamy. Larry Young is one of those scientists, from the Yerkes National Primate Research Center in Atlanta, Georgia. He joins me now. Welcome to the program, Larry. LARRY YOUNG: Thank you. MARTIN: Let's start with the courtship phase of this relationship. What happens when a male prairie vole spots an eligible female? YOUNG: Well, the first thing he has to do is to get her interested in him and he does that by kind of just courting her. And the smell of her pheromones gets her brain activated and she starts turning out steroid hormones, like estrogen. And after about 24 hours she's ready to mate. MARTIN: OK. So, in the wild, prairie voles don't have a long life expectancy. But in the lab, where they're under the conditions where they can have longer lives, I understand that bond is strong enough to keep them together for a long time. YOUNG: Absolutely. They'll stay together for the rest of their life, which in the lab is around two or three years. But even in the wild, they're known as the potato chip of the prairie because they are preyed upon by hawks and other things. But, you know, they can live for a year or so. And in about 80 percent of the cases where a male or a female loses their partner, they never take on another partner. So, they really do stay together for life. MARTIN: Wow. That's amazing. They're not always faithful though. YOUNG: Yes. Actually, this is one of the features that actually I think makes it an even better model for humans than you might think. Because even though they are together, if a male is wandering through the prairie and a female who's in estrous comes by, he may mate with her. But the important thing is he comes back to his partner at night. And that's what we're really studying here. We're studying the bond between the two. MARTIN: That's not enough, Larry. That's not enough. . . YOUNG: I'm sorry. That's. . . MARTIN: . . . to just come home. (LAUGHTER) YOUNG: . . . that's the best that we can do with these animals. And in fact, most monogamous species - only about 3 percent of mammals exhibit this kind of monogamy. But in almost all of those species, there is some cheating that occurs. MARTIN: Does all this mean that one day there will be some kind of infidelity vaccine? I mean, is that possible? Is that why you're studying the voles? YOUNG: No, we're not studying the voles to try to find an infidelity vaccine or even a love vaccine. No, I think the importance of this work is, you know, if we understand the biology underlying relationships, maybe we can help get better ideas about how to improve those relationships, how to change our behaviors to help spark that neurochemistry in our brain that will help us maintain lifelong relationships with our partner.

He's a professor of acoustic engineering at the University of Salford in England. And now, he's written a book based on what he has found. The book is called \"The Sound Book: The Science of the Sonic Wonders of the World. \" He's gone to creaking glaciers, humming dunes, and a Mayan pyramid that chirps like a bird. In his book, Cox explores natural environments with surprising acoustical characteristics and also man-made environments. For example, accidental whispering galleries. TREVOR COX: In Britain, probably the most famous whispering gallery is in St. Paul's Cathedral. And you can go up into the base of the dome and you whisper into one side of the dome and the sound skims around the inside. And your friend can hear it on the other side, you know, 30, 35 meters away, and it sounds like this whisper's emerging from the wall remarkably loud. SIEGEL: But it wasn't built that way. No one said, let's have a whisper gallery. COX: No. It's just pure accident. You can get it out of lots of curved surfaces. There's a dam in Australia which acts like a whispering wall. Well, they didn't build a dam in Australia to give you this acoustic effect but it's a tourist attraction. They obviously built it to hold back water. SIEGEL: You provided us with the sound of - actually, it's a balloon bursting in the whispering gallery. I gather balloons bursting are - it's a stock in trade for you. (SOUNDBITE OF BALLOON BURSTING)COX: I do seem to be spending a lot of time bursting balloons. This is not the one in St. Paul's Cathedral because, funny enough, the attendants wouldn't let me burst a balloon. But this is actually up in a radar dome in Germany called war listening station, which has this perfectly spherical dome at the top, which has this most amazing effect because the normal whispering gallery, you whisper and the sound just goes around the dome once. When you make a big sound, it goes around many times. You can hear it during many circuits of the whispering gallery. (SOUNDBITE OF BALLOON BURSTING)SIEGEL: You do write about one example where people made interesting use of the acoustic accident of architecture. There's a church where the whisper function was used for priests taking the confession of lepers. COX: I'm not sure how true it is but it certainly is told lots. You go and visit Clonmacnoise in Ireland there, you'll certainly get told the story. It's a sort of ornate, sort of Gothic archway, with a nice round sort of pipe work, you know, coming around the top of the arch. And the idea is the priest would stand in one side of the doorway, and the leper would stand in the other. And they'd whisper into this tunnel effectively, and the sound would whiz around. And that would mean the priest wouldn't have to get too near the leper when taking confession. SIEGEL: It's such a good story, I'm inclined to have you tell it on the air even if it isn't true, it's so good. COX: I just thought, being a scientist, I ought to just put the skeptical point. (LAUGHTER)SIEGEL: That's very good. One of the sonic wonders of the world that you sought out for this book was the place with the - I guess it's the longest reverberation in the world. And I want you to tell us about what you think at least would qualify as the most reverberating site on Earth. COX: Yeah. I mean, Guinness has acknowledged it. It's the most - well, they call it the longest echo. It was a bit of an argument about terminology because it's actually reverberation. But it's Guinness' record. They can call it what they like, I guess. I was told about this place. It was an old oil storage depot. This is up in Scotland and it was - it supplied the navy with shipping oil. They're the size of a small cathedral on the inside, but there are really smooth walls. So we went to measure it. We fired a starting pistol, which is a normal measurement way of doing it, and the sound - the recordings last about 60, 70 seconds. (SOUNDBITE OF GUNSHOT)SIEGEL: I don't think we have enough time to wait for this sound to stop reverberating. COX: Yeah. I mean, it's quite amazing. I stood there because I was watching the time on the digital recorder ticking up and I just could not believe how long it was. SIEGEL: At the opposite extreme of the sounds that you sample for the book is being inside an anechoic chamber. Unlike the other places that you report on, it's actually built not to have an echo. COX: You know, when you're doing acoustic engineering, at some point you've got to measure, let's say, a loudspeaker or a microphone, you don't want the effect of rooms or whatever noise. So you go into an isolated room where there's no effect, acoustically, of a room. And that's what an anechoic chamber provides. So big acoustic labs have them. SIEGEL: Well, we heard the sound of a balloon bursting inside that amazingly reverberant tank in Inchindown. (SOUNDBITE OF BALLOON BURSTING)SIEGEL: Here's the sound you recorded of a balloon bursting inside the anechoic chamber. Boy, was that a letdown. COX: But actually it kind of isn't. I think it's sort of underwhelmingly magnificent, really, because you expect to hear a bang like you would at a kid's party when the balloon bursts, and it goes phut(ph). It doesn't really do very much. SIEGEL: Do you have a favorite noise of all the ones that you recorded for \"The Sound Book\"? COX: I guess the one which gave me the biggest smile was probably the musical road in California, which plays the \"William Tell Overture\" rather badly as you drive over it. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)COX: That gave me quite a laugh. SIEGEL: You have to explain how that is that you hear the \"William Tell Overture. \"COX: Well, when you drive down the highway, often there's rumble strips down the side which stop you driving, you know, if you were to veer off the highway, you'd make a buzzing sound. Well, a musical road takes that a step further by changing the spacing of the corrugations so that you get a tune out of it. So sometimes the corrugations are close together. You get a high frequency. Sometimes they're far apart. You get a low frequency. And the musical road in Lancaster, in California is - all these ridges or actually grooves are spaced out on the second lane, and it actually will play the entire first phrase from the theme from \"The Lone Ranger. \"(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)COX: They got the spacing of the rumble strip wrong. It's got, you know, it would be amusing if it wasn't tragic. And so it should be - the last note should go up to an octave above the first note, but it doesn't. It goes up - for those that are musical, it goes up about a fifth. So it could sound a lot better. SIEGEL: Trevor Cox, thank you very much for talking with us today. COX: It was a pleasure.

I'm Melissa Block. ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: And I'm Robert Siegel. We often talk about climate change as a matter of science, but the biggest questions are really about money: How much would it cost to fix it and what price we will pay if we don't. Well, we're about to meet the man who invented the field of climate economics. And he says the best way to tackle climate change is also through dollars and cents. William Nordhaus wrote a book that lays out his idea in simple terms. NPR's Richard Harris took a trip to Yale University to talk to this celebrated economist. RICHARD HARRIS, BYLINE: The buzz here on the Yale campus is that it's only a matter of time before Bill Nordhaus lands the Nobel Prize. But there's not a trace of haughtiness in the gentle, 72-year-old's demeanor. BILL NORDHAUS: Come on upstairs. HARRIS: He tromps up the staircase of this 19th century building in his mud boots. Silver hair sweeps across his high brow. Nordhaus' expansive suite is part parlor, part library and part office. He's been at Yale since 1967. And as we settle into a couple of chairs, he says his ideas about climate change date back to 1974, when he was a research scholar in Austria. NORDHAUS: And I happened to share an office with a climatologist. And I was doing energy research. And he said: Well, you know, this is where energy research is going to be going. And I said, well, OK, tell me about it. And that's how it started. HARRIS: Some scientists were starting to think about climate change back in the early '70s, but Nordhaus says not so in the world of economics. NORDHAUS: It was a zero on the intellectual Kelvin scale in economics. There was nothing at that point. HARRIS: Nordhaus started to grapple with the basic question. Climate change was looming because people were burning cheap fossil fuels. Carbon dioxide is building up in the atmosphere and each ton increases the risk of sea level rise, shifting climate, and other changes that are likely to cost a huge amount of money to address in the future. Right now, nobody pays for that, and it wasn't even clear what the price should be. NORDHAUS: When we did our first calculations they actually spun out these shadow prices. And I remember looking at them and trying to think of what in the world does that mean. HARRIS: He realized that those shadow prices actually represented the cost of putting carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. And with that, climate change suddenly became a problem that could be attacked with the tools of economics. NORDHAUS: Actually from an economic point of view, it's a pretty simple problem. HARRIS: If people would simply pay the cost of using the atmosphere as a dump for carbon dioxide, that would create a powerful incentive to dump less and invest in cleaner ways to generate energy. But how do you do that? NORDHAUS: We need to put a price on carbon so that when anyone, anywhere, any time does something that puts carbon dioxide in the atmosphere there's a price tag on that. HARRIS: After that initial inspiration, a lot of Nordhaus' work has been figuring out how big a price we should pay and what form it should take. It could be a carbon tax, preferably in place of other taxes. Or it could be a cap-and-trade system, where polluters buy and trade the rights to put carbon in the air. California and Europe are starting to put policies like this in place. NORDHAUS: The real point of the pricing is not to gouge people, not to extract resources from people. It's to tilt the playing field in such a way that people, firms, governments, everybody move toward carbon free or low carbon activities. HARRIS: Nordhaus has laid out how to do this in a book, called the \"Climate Casino. \" The not-so-subtle point of the title is that we're gambling with our future if we don't do anything about climate change. And Nordhaus knows the challenge isn't the economics, it's us. His studies show that it makes economic sense to start paying the price now, even though the benefits would be decades away. NORDHAUS: That's a pretty tough one because we're going to have to be grownups, I think. There are lots of things we do where the investments come way, way in the future. Educating four-year-olds, I mean that's an investment that goes way in the future as well. HARRIS: But for this to affect the climate, he finds that at least half of the planet needs to work together, or it will be all pain and no gain. Nordhaus is hardly a saber-rattler on this subject. Though he sees the potential for very serious problems down the road, he still says that global warming can actually be good for agriculture, at least up to a point. And he says we shouldn't do any more to address climate change than what makes economic sense, even if that means letting the planet warm up more than the international target of two degrees Celsius. I now that sometimes environmentalists get frustrated that you sound calm and they don't feel calm. (LAUGHTER)NORDHAUS: Well, what can I say about calm? What I like to think of the economics as a cool head in the service of a warm heart, and that's my approach to this. HARRIS: People who have been dubious about climate change have, over the years, quoted Nordhaus' work to argue that it doesn't require urgent action. But lately, urgency has been creeping into Nordhaus' voice. NORDHAUS: At some point you move from calm to concerned. I'm not at panic, but I'd say there are some pretty deep concerns about what's going on, particularly at the slow pace of the steps that countries are taking to deal with climate change. HARRIS: His numbers show that the world can actually afford to take the steps we need to rein in climate change, provided that we make smart choices about how to do it. Richard Harris, NPR News.

He says the slow gears of economics won't save us. Instead, he was in town to warn that we are in a perilous path toward attempting a technological fix - engineering the climate. We'll get back to that in a few minutes but first, a bit of context. Hamilton is a Deep Green progressive. A few years back, he wrote a book called \"Requiem for a Species. \" And that title pretty well sets the tone for his glum outlook on life at the precipice of climate change. HAMILTON: Well, I think anyone who looks at the science and the severity of what we face and takes a realistic view of the prospects of political action over the next decade or so, anyone who understands that has to be glum. HARRIS: As we settle into an interview, Hamilton digs back into intellectual history. He puts our current plight into the context of the Age of Reason, the Enlightenment. HAMILTON: For some 300 years or so, we've imagined that we are rational creatures who gather evidence, assess it and change our behavior in order to ensure our future. Well, we're not doing that. HARRIS: He says human beings have never had to face a challenge of this magnitude that calls for both rapid action and the cooperation of many nations all around the world. HAMILTON: But I think there are some deeper things going on to do, you know, deep within the human psyche, to do with an unwillingness to face up to the severity of what the climate scientists are saying is going to unfold, is already unfolding but will unfold over the next decades. HARRIS: There's a huge gap between what need to be done and what's considered doable from an economic and political point of view. HAMILTON: You see this bizarre thing that goes on. HARRIS: People who frame the question by asking what's practical end up with proposed solutions that will be hopelessly inadequate. Here's how Hamilton hears their internal monologue. HAMILTON: The scientists are saying that we have to cut our greenhouse gas emissions extremely quickly, which is unprecedented in policy terms. Therefore, let's just take the scientists in a small dose and think about what's politically possible. Well, you can do that. And that's what we've done for 20 years. But we're screwed as a result. HARRIS: And this is where the topic of manipulating the atmosphere in order to cool the planet comes into play. HAMILTON: As the climatic emergencies unfold over the next decade, there is going to be a call on political leaders to do something. Desperate times call for desperate measures. HARRIS: And for example if you spray sulfur particles high into the atmosphere, scientists are confident that that will cool the planet. It will doubtless have other unanticipated effects as well, and those could cause political conflict and ecological harm. But Hamilton says if there is some sort of a climate crisis, we're likely to reach for that risky, technological fix. HAMILTON: I think the pressures for it are really going to be overwhelming. HARRIS: Hamilton says that's in part because the same people and think tanks, who now deny the overwhelming scientific evidence for climate change, are at the same time starting to talk about engineering the Earth's atmosphere. HAMILTON: The politics of it are, for conservatives, extremely attractive. You don't have to put taxes on gas or on electricity. You don't have to ask consumers to change their lifestyles. You don't have to take on fossil fuel corporations. And on the other hand, it's a kind of vindication of man's technological supremacy. HARRIS: Clive Hamilton frets about the consequences of running that global experiment, but he holds out slim hope for a less risky path forward. Richard Harris, NPR News. ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:  From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Robert Siegel. MELISSA BLOCK, HOST:  And I'm Melissa Block. Yesterday on the program, we heard from a prominent economist who argues we can rein in climate change by putting a real price on dumping carbon into the air. Simply put, economic strategies can steer us away from a potential climate crisis. But those strategies have so far gained very little traction. Today, NPR's Richard Harris reports on another big thinker who warns by doing too little about climate change in the past, decision-makers are now careening toward desperate measures.

I'm Terry Gross. We're living in an epoch many scientists describe as the sixth extinction. The fifth extinction was the one that killed off the dinosaurs. Scientists now think an asteroid was responsible for that mass extinction, but this time around, human activity is responsible, or as one scientist put it, this time we're the asteroid. My guest, Elizabeth Kolbert, is the author of the new book \"The Sixth Extinction. \" It begins with a history of the big five extinctions of the past and goes on to explain how human behavior is creating the sixth, including our use of fossil fuels, which has led to climate change. Climate change was the subject of Kolbert's previous book, \"Field Notes from a Catastrophe. \"Her research for the new book took her around the world to oceans, rainforests and mountains, as well as a place nearly in her backyard, where scientists are studying die-offs of plants and animals. Elizabeth Kolbert, welcome to FRESH AIR. So when we're talking about the sixth extinction, what are we talking about? What are the species that are likely to become extinct or that have already become extinct? What is dying off? ELIZABETH KOLBERT: Well, when you're talking about an extinction event, the definition I suppose would be many, many organisms across many, many different groups. And, you know, that is really what we are seeing, and that is what make scientists fear, I suppose you'd say the word, that we're in a mass extinction. You're seeing mammals, about a quarter of all mammals are considered endangered, for example; about 40 percent of amphibians are considered endangered, but we're also seeing organisms - invertebrates for example, are endangered; for example reef-building corals, many species of reef-building corals are now considered very, very endangered. So you're seeing extinctions across a wide variety of groups, and that I think would have to be, you know, one of the defining characteristics of a mass extinction. GROSS: I think of carbon emissions as affecting the atmosphere. But you write about how it's also affecting the oceans and life within oceans. How are greenhouse gases affecting the acidity of oceans? KOLBERT: Well that's (unintelligible) that I think is not as fully appreciated as it should be, and it's sort of one of the reasons, even, you could say that I wrote the book. And that is people are pretty aware now of what CO2 emissions, you know, tailpipe emissions do to the atmosphere. They warm the atmosphere. The Earth is getting warmer. There's, you know, no doubt about that. But what happens when you put CO2 into the air is that you're also effectively pumping it into the oceans because wherever the surface of the oceans and atmosphere meet, there's just an exchange of gases. So about a third of the CO2 that we put up every year, and that's on the order of, you know, 10 billion metric tons, is making its way into the oceans. And when CO2 dissolves in water, it forms an acid. It's called carbonic acid. It's a very weak acid, and you're drinking it, for example, when you drink a Coke. And it's that little bit of acidity that give soft drinks what's sometimes called their zest. You know, and it's one of the reasons we don't like to drink soft drinks that are flat, that they taste very treacley(ph). But you do that on a massive enough scale, and you are changing the chemistry of the ocean. You're turning the water more and more acidic, for those who remember their high school chemistry lowering the pH of the water. And that's exactly what we're doing. And if you're a marine organism, and you think about it, you're in the water, you're completely - everything that - your whole environment is the water. And then when you change the chemistry of the water, that can have very, very profound effects. GROSS: Which is why you say ocean acidification is sometimes referred to as global warming's evil twin. KOLBERT: Yeah, global warming's equally evil twin, exactly. And from the perspective of, you know, the broad expanse of life, there have been a few moments in time where the oceans have become acidified, not necessarily acidic but acidified, so more and more acidified, and they are associated with some of the major crises in the history of life. GROSS: To help you understand the impact of the acidification of the oceans, you went to a tiny island that has naturally occurring gas bubbles, and there's carbon dioxide in those gas bubbles. So what kinds of experiments are going on in this island? KOLBERT: Well that's a really interesting story, and it involves a great guy whom I went out with named Jason Hall-Spencer, who's a British marine biologist. And he came to this idea, just sort of almost by chance. He went swimming off of this tiny island, as you say, and it - which is in the Bay of Naples. It's off of Ischia in Italy. And their CO2, this is an area of a lot of volcanic activity, and their CO2 just coming naturally out of the bottom of the water, just bubbling up. And people like to go swimming there because it's very cool, and it's like sort of swimming in fizzy water or champagne. And some people took him swimming there, and he realized wow, this is a natural experiment in ocean acidification. This is CO2 being pumped into the water from below, and it's very similar to what we're doing, sort of effectively pumping CO2 into the water from above. And if I look at what's happening around here, I will be able to look -effectively look into the future and see what's going to happen if we continue to pump CO2 into the air. And so he did a census around this island of marine creatures as you were far away from these CO2 bubbles and as you got closer and closer. And what he found, and I went out with him, and we went swimming in this frigid water, and you see this amazing tableau where when you're far away from the vents, you're seeing a very vivid, you know, underwater world with sea urchins and barnacles and corals and all - fish and all sorts of things that you expect to see in the Mediterranean. And then as you get closer and closer to the vents, you see less and less until you get to this landscape that looks really like a lunar landscape, where very, very little can survive. So this is sort of like this interesting underwater time machine where we can look into the future of the oceans. GROSS: So if our oceans ended up looking like the area where there's these naturally occurring gas vents are, what would our oceans end up looking like? KOLBERT: Well, his experiments suggest that if we continue, you know, at our present rate of CO2 emissions, then by the end of this century, ocean pH, ocean - will have dropped, or ocean acidity will have increased, depending on how you want to say it, to the point where roughly a third, in his - in this particular ecosystem roughly a third of the organisms drop out when you get to that pH. So you're looking at eliminating a third of the creatures in the ocean for - as a very, very rough estimate. And then as you go on, as you get closer and closer to the vents, so even beyond, you know, what we expect at the end of this century if we just sort of continue beyond that point, then you're getting to a point where, you know, your oceans really start to look sort of like the underwater equivalent of a vacant lot. GROSS: So, you know, if we just want to look at it in a very selfish way, this is going to affect what we eat. KOLBERT: Well, I think that, you know, already, obviously, long before you get to sort of the end of this century and the effects of ocean acidification that he saw, we're already seeing tremendous effects to the ocean from a variety of causes, you know, overfishing, bottom trawling. Global warming is really changing where the oceans are warming very quickly. It's really changing where things can live, what things can live. So yeah, we're definitely seeing changes to what we as people can eat, absolutely. GROSS: Now you also went to the Great Barrier Reef, off the coast of Australia. What were you looking for there? KOLBERT: Well, that was an amazing place, perhaps the most amazing place I've ever been in my life, and I also went with a great group of scientists there. A scientist out of Stanford named Ken Caldeira was running a series of  experiments off of this tiny, tiny little island that just sort of pokes up out of the reef. You're essentially on the reef, and every 12 hours, basically at low tide, people would walk across the reed and just go to collect water samples, from which they were trying to tease out the question of how corals are responding to these changes in ocean chemistry. And to walk across the Great Barrier Reef in the middle of the night is a wonderful, wonderful experience. So one of the sort of ironies of writing this whole book and of this whole project was I got to go to these amazing places and see the most amazing creatures in the process of looking at how humans are affecting the world. So you'd sort of go to the ends of the Earth, and yet still what you were looking at was how humans are affecting this place. GROSS: So how are humans affecting the Great Barrier Reef? KOLBERT: Well, humans are affecting the Great Barrier Reef. In this particular case what they were looking at was how this input of CO2, so how the changes in ocean chemistry, people had measured the rate at which the reef was sort of you could say putting on weight, so growing, a couple decades ago, back in the '70s. And they were looking at the rate at which the reef was growing now. And one of the impacts that's predicted from ocean acidification, just due to sort of basic, you know, chemistry, you don't even have to do any experiments really, is that it's going to be harder and harder for any organism that makes a shell or an external skeleton like a coral out of the mineral calcium carbonate. It's going to get harder and harder for them to do that. And that is exactly what people are finding. That's what they found on One Tree Island, that the rate at which the reef was growing has declined substantially. And as this process continues, so as the ocean acidification increases, that rate is going to slow and slow until the point, which is unfortunately not very far in the future, where it seems that corals will no longer be able to keep up with basically the forces that are trying to wear them down, which is everything from organisms that eat away, fish that eat away at the reef and just wave action. And then you're looking at the basically collapse of the whole ecosystem, the reef ecosystem, which supports an extraordinary array of creatures, as anyone who's ever seen, you know, any underwater footage of a coral reef knows, and as I saw when I was out on the Great Barrier Reef, it's just this extraordinary, you know, Jacques Cousteau-esque picture that unfolds under your eyes when you're looking down into the water. GROSS: So this is going to sound like a horrible question, but, you know, I don't get to see barrier reefs, I don't get to see coral, I live in the city. What impact does it have on my life if coral reefs can't grow anymore and if they start declining because of the acidification of the oceans? KOLBERT: Well, I guess I'd give you two answers. The first answer is, you know, we are effectively undoing, you know, the beauty and the variety and the richness of the world, which has taken tens of millions of years to reach this point. We're sort of unraveling that. And if that is something that you just say, well, I don't care about, then I guess I'd say, well, what do you care about. (LAUGHTER)KOLBERT: But on another, on a more, you know, personal sort of like I want to know how - you know, what's it mean to me, I guess my answer would be we're not sure. You know, no one's - we haven't done this before. You don't get to sort of see this experiment run over and over again. So we're doing, it's often said, a massive experiment on the planet, and we really don't know what the end point's going to be. GROSS: OK, that's actually a very impressive answer because who knows, right. KOLBERT: Right, exactly. And I think one of the lessons and one of the points of writing the book, as well, is one of the lessons of the mass extinctions of the past is that very dominant organisms - I mean, the dinosaurs, as people point out, we like to think of the dinosaurs, you know, we even use the word dinosaur to mean some sort of lumbering idiot, you know, something that's obsolete. The dinosaurs were not obsolete. The dinosaurs were not doing anything wrong. They were just unfortunate. And the rules of the game changed very suddenly, and they were gone. And we're not sure why dinosaurs are gone, but they seem to have had some vulnerability to what happened in this extinction event. And we don't know what the end result of what we're doing is. But the rules - if the rules of the game change, you know, then you could sort of - I guess you could say all bets are off at that point. GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is Elizabeth Kolbert. She writes about science for the New Yorker. Her new book is called \"The Sixth Extinction: An Unnatural History,\" and it's about how global change and other manmade changes to the environment are, scientists say, creating a new mass extinction. Let's take a short break here; then we'll talk some more. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)GROSS: This is FRESH AIR, and if you're just joining us, my guest is Elizabeth Kolbert. She writes about science for the New Yorker. Her previous book was about global warming. Her new book is about how the impact of global warming and other manmade changes to the earth and the atmosphere are creating what scientists are calling a sixth extinction, a mass number of species has become or is on the verge of becoming extinct. No one knows exactly where this will lead, but her book is about ongoing experiments and studies to try to understand this new extinction. And it's also about the histories of the previous mass extinctions. You write that amphibians are the world's most endangered class of animals and that some scientists argue that an extinction that is catastrophic for amphibians is already underway. So let's start with a real basic question here. Like explain what comes under the category of amphibian. KOLBERT: Well, frogs, toads, salamanders and this very, very interesting, weird, limbless class of creatures that we very rarely see in the temperate zone and that in fact you very rarely see even in the tropics called caecilians. Those are the three groups of amphibians. GROSS: And I've been reading about, like, frog extinctions, mysterious, like, mass frog deaths for years. And were frogs among the first of the amphibians to really be noticed as dying off? KOLBERT: Yes, absolutely, what's become known as the amphibian crisis first came to the notice of scientists when people went out in places that they had always found, you know, huge numbers of frogs and toads, who are, you know, related, and just couldn't find them, just literally could not find them, places where - you know, in for example in the Sierras, one scientist told me that he went to a place where in his own youth, in his own graduate student days, you could go up there, and you couldn't avoid these frogs. You could practically not avoid stepping on them. And they went up there, and they just couldn't find any. GROSS: In fact you went to a place that used to be filled with golden frogs, and they've disappeared. KOLBERT: Yeah, that's a very fascinating and amazing story, which is this is in Panama, in central Panama. There's a frog known as the Panamanian golden frog. And it's a beautiful, beautiful frog. It's sort of a taxicab yellow frog with very skinny arms and legs. And it's considered a good luck symbol. It was often printed on, like, lottery tickets in Panama. And there were places that you could go where these yellow frogs were just all over. One herpetologist described it to me as just crazy. You know, they were just everywhere sunning themselves. They like to sun themselves. And then this scourge came through, which turns out to be a fungus, a fungal disease, and just wiped them out. And what happened is that scientists realized because they had seen this pattern before, they actually anticipated this, and they took some of them out of the forest into a conservation center in central Panama, just like basically an ark. And they are breeding them there. They're still there. There are still Panamanian golden frogs in this center, but they cannot go back out into the world, into their own native habitat, because this fungus is still there, and the fungus survives even though the frogs no longer do. GROSS: Now is the fungus a result of human activity? KOLBERT: Well, that is - certainly seems to be the case because this fungal disease appeared, interestingly enough, in many really disparate parts of the world at the same time, and that's what really had people scratching their heads back in the early '90s. You know, how do we get this - these amphibians disappearing in these often very untouched, seemingly untouched places but in very different parts of the world, you know, in South America, in Australia, you know, oceans away. And so people have surmised that it must have been something that was moved around the world by people because, you know, a fungus really can't cross the oceans. And one theory, it's been very difficult to pin down, but one theory is that this fungus was moved around the world, another really interesting story, on frogs that were used in the '50s and '60s for pregnancy tests, something called the African clawed frog. If you inject it with the urine of a woman who's pregnant, it will lay eggs very quickly, and obstetricians used to keep whole tanks of these frogs in their offices, and the African clawed frog turns out to be a frog that carries this fungus but doesn't seem to be killed by it. So one theory is that as these frogs were imported, or exported I guess you'd say, all around the world, they carried this fungus with them. They were subsequently sometimes maybe, you know, let go by an obstetrician who didn't want them anymore. They established themselves in various places, and maybe they brought it around the world. So we brought the frogs, and the frogs brought the fungus. GROSS: Wow. (LAUGHTER)KOLBERT: Yeah, it's. . . GROSS: I didn't even know that - I've heard of the rabbit test, where you injected a woman's urine into a rabbit to see if she's pregnant. I've never heard of the frog test. KOLBERT: The frog test. The frog test was very widely used. And if you talk to people who, you know, were around then, you know, there are people who still remember, you went to your obstetrician, and there was a tank of frogs. (LAUGHTER)KOLBERT: Yeah, I know. It sounds - but it's also one of this. . . GROSS: Excuse me. (LAUGHTER)KOLBERT: Yeah, yeah, it's one of those things - talk about unintended consequences to cause a major die-off of a really, really ancient group. I should say amphibians have been around for a really, really long time. GROSS: Yeah, you say amphibians, like they survived the other extinctions. KOLBERT: Yeah, they're tough. They're survivors. They predate, you know, the dinosaurs. And they're still around. And they're being really, really, really hard-hit right now. GROSS: So there's a lot of different species of frogs that have been hit by this, not just the golden frogs that you went to see. KOLBERT: Yeah, there are dozens of species that were probably done in by this fungus, many of them these really colorful tropical frogs that are just beautiful. GROSS: Elizabeth Kolbert will be back in the second half of the show. Her new book is called \"The Sixth Extinction. \" I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross back with Elizabeth Kolbert. We're talking about her new book, \"The Sixth Extinction. \" Scientists believe the fifth extinction - which killed the dinosaurs - was caused by an asteroid. But in the epoch we're living in, the sixth extinction, it's human behavior that's responsible for mass die-offs of plants, animals and insects. As we're about to hear, one of the contributing factors is human travel. Kolbert is a staff writer for The New Yorker. Her previous book was about climate change. Because we are so mobile, especially with air travel now, we've been moving around plants and animals, insects and bacteria and viruses, and we've been doing this voluntarily and involuntarily in our travels, totally, you know, reshaping certain aspects of the ecosystems of the world. And you say that scientists are describing the era we're in as the New Pangaea. Tell us what the original Pangaea was. KOLBERT: The original Pangaea - and this is, you know, taking a very long view here -the original Pangaea was a supercontinent, it's called a supercontinent. And it was this interesting moment in geological history about 300 million years ago to about 200 million years ago - let's say very roughly - where all of the world's land masses sort of due to plate tectonics just, you know, cruised into each other and crashed into each other and you had basically all the land in the world in one clump. And that was Pangaea. GROSS: And why is this being called the New Pangaea? KOLBERT: Well, it's, if you take the very long view once again, then you realize that since Pangaea began to break up, all of these evolutionary lineages have been evolving separately on separate continents for, you know, roughly 200 million years, let's say. And so they've taken different paths. This is something that, you know, was very important to Darwin. Darwin looked at that different continents and he saw that they had different fauna, even though, say, their climate and their terrain were very similar, so parts of South America were very similar in that sense to parts of Australia, but they had completely different flora and fauna and that was because they've been evolving separately for such a long time. He didn't understand plate tectonics but he knew that they'd been separated - that they were separated. And now what we're doing, if you are taking the flora and faunas, so the plants and animals of South America and you're moving them to Australia and vice versa - and we see this all around, you know, lots of Asian species in the U. S. now, lots of North American species in Europe, lots of European species in Australia. You're effectively recombining the continents and bringing these evolutionary lineages back together, and very, very quickly, from one day to the next, OK? So after, you know, tens of millions of years of evolving separately, we say, OK, one day we're going to, you know, see what happens when we throw you together. And when you do do that, it turns out sometimes nothing happens, but sometimes very, very catastrophic things happen. GROSS: Give us an example of something catastrophic. KOLBERT: Well, a good example often comes from islands, day. So there's a very famous example on the island of Guam. Something called the brown tree snake was introduced from New Guinea probably during World War I in military cargo. It was brought to Guam and it went absolutely, you know, sort of berserk. It had no enemies. One thing that happens when you move something around is it probably may not have any natural predators, so the brown tree snake had no predators in Guam, and Guam itself lacked any animal and it's only snake was this, you know, tiny little wormlike thing. And so it's birds, there were a lot of bird that fell victim to it. It's a very, very voracious snake, it turns out. It went wild, multiplied until there were something like 40 snakes per acre, killed off a lot of the island's native birds, a lot of reptiles were affected, the bats were affected, so the snake just came in and took what's sometimes called naive populations. This is especially true on islands and basically wiped them out. GROSS: The idea of humans moving around species and bacteria and viruses and so on to places where they didn't naturally occur, that's nothing new. I mean there's something that's now known as the Columbian Exchange, like when Columbus and other explorers went to different parts of the world - including the Americas - they brought plants and animals with them to the continents that they were exploring and then brought back home plants and animals from the continents they had explored. So this whole idea of moving around the ecosystem is centuries old. KOLBERT: Absolutely. This is not, I mean a lot of, one of the points I also, you know, sort of hope comes through in the book is this is not a new project that humans are embarked upon. And exactly, we can go back to pre-Colombian times. We can go back to for example, people reached Australia, you know, 50,000 years ago - which is an ,amazing fact that people reached Australia 50,000 years ago. But they found this sort of amazing cast of huge animals - huge birds, huge kangaroos, huge wombat-like creatures that are known as rhinoceros wombat that sort of look like, you know, enormous guinea pigs, let's say, and they are no longer there. You know, so people have been at this world-altering project for quite a while now. And when the first, in terms of bringing species around the world, for example, rats were brought with very early Polynesian settlers in the Pacific, so they were brought to, you know, places like Fiji and they wreaked havoc. They wreaked absolute havoc already, you know, say, 1,500 years ago. So you're absolutely right, this is not a project that we've suddenly embarked upon, but I think what has changed is the scale and the rate. For example, it's been estimated that just in ship ballast now in our enormous supertankers, people are moving 10,000 species a day around the world. So even though our ancestors, you know, were already at this project, and did caused significant effects because of that and significant numbers of extinctions, we have just ramped it up to a whole new level. GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is Elizabeth Kolbert. She writes about science for The New Yorker. She's the author of a new book called \"The Sixth Extinction,\" and it's about what many scientists believe is a mass extinction that is now underway, that is as important as previous extinctions, like the mass extinction of dinosaurs. Kolbert's previous book was about climate change. Elizabeth, let's take a short break and then we'll talk some more. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. My guest is Elizabeth Kolbert. She writes about science for \"The New Yorker. \" Her new book is called \"The Sixth Extinction,\" and it's about what many scientists believe is a mass extinction that we are beginning to experience, that's affecting life in the ocean and on land. Her previous book was about climate change. She writes about science for The New Yorker. You know, when we look at the big picture about how ecosystems are changing and how many, you know, species are becoming extinct, if you look at the big picture, there's the catastrophe, you know, whether it's like, you know, a glacial - glacially caused die-off or an asteroid, you know, caused series of extinctions or, you know, climate change, global warming, but then there's also, you know, evolution. Evolution is a very, very slow process of adaptation and catastrophe is a much kind of quicker and sudden dramatic change. So how did catastrophe and evolution coexist or balance each other or not balance each other? KOLBERT: Well, that's a really, I mean really interesting question, and how people have come to look at the whole history of the world as this interesting - as I quote one paleontologist describing it, as long periods of boredom interrupted occasionally by panic. (LAUGHTER)KOLBERT: And the history of, you know, how we came to see the world this way, that is the history of science in that sense, that's part - that's a story that I sort of open the book with in a way. And that dates all the way back to the beginning of the 19th century when the whole history, the whole concept of extinction was in a way discovered. And what's interesting is before that, people really didn't even think there was such a thing as extinction. They couldn't imagine that the creator would create something that wouldn't be around forever. So when people started to find really interesting things, mastodon bones, mammoth bones, they just assumed that those creatures were out there somewhere. And in fact Thomas Jefferson, when he sent Lewis and Clark out to the American Northwest, he really hoped that they were going to find live mastodons roaming around out there because he really could not accept the fact that they were gone. And it was a French naturalist who said, you know, that's ridiculous. Obviously they're gone, these creatures are extinct. And he really - his name is Georges Cuvier, he's a very fascinating character. He really invented - as it were - the concept of extinction. And he thought all extinctions were caused in these catastrophic changes. And then Darwin and his - Darwin's mentor, a man named Charles Lyle, came along, and they completely dismissed the idea that you could have catastrophes. They decided that the Earth changed very, very slowly and only very slowly. They made a slight sort of logical leap there. It changed slowly and it could only change slowly. So the idea of catastrophe really was discredited. We just didn't get events like that. And it was only pretty recently, in the '80s, when it was discovered by a scientist named Walter Alvarez, who is out of Berkeley, that an asteroid impact was what had done in the dinosaurs, and that was extremely controversial at the time and now very well accepted, that this concept that we could get catastrophic change on the Earth was accepted, and now I think the general sort of sense, which, you know, is sort of a hybrid of the two, is that, yes, the world changes very, very slowly, except at certain moments when it doesn't. And it seems that we are in one of those moments when it is in fact changing very, very fast and, of course, we are the agent for that. GROSS: So when you look at the mass extinctions, what do scientists say about the odds that humans are going to survive? KOLBERT: Well, I. . . (LAUGHTER)KOLBERT: I sort of pointedly try to avoid that question. I mean I think if you were, you know, saying, well, what's going to survive an event that humans have set in motion, I guess you would bet on humans. We're very, very clever. We're very technologically able. There are a lot of us. There's, you know, right now about 7. 2 billion of us and if we continue on the trajectory we're on, you know, there are one of the nine or 10 billion soon. So if you were sort of just betting what creature, you know, would survive this, I think you would bet on humans. But as I said before, one of the very, very sobering things about looking back at the mass extinctions of the past is that when the rules change you don't really know what's going to happen. So I guess you'd say if you were a species, you know, causing a mass extinction, you wouldn't necessarily feel entirely secure. GROSS: One scientist is predicting that it's rats who will one day take over the Earth. KOLBERT: Yeah. That's a wonderful, I mean I should say that's part. . . GROSS: Did you say wonderful? (LAUGHTER)KOLBERT: Well, it's a wonderful, it's a wonderful idea. It's a very graphic, vivid idea, I think, that captures people's imagination. And I should say it's partly tongue-in-cheek, but partly not. And that idea comes from a geologist that I went out with named Jan Zalasiewicz. And he is in fact leading this whole effort to assess whether we should formally name a new geological epoch, whether we live now in the Anthropocene, and he has written about looking into the future. Because part of what we're doing, which is, you know, interesting and also very sobering, is we're closing off certain evolutionary paths, but we're also opening up certain evolutionary paths, right? So what is going to populate the planet millions and millions of years from now is going to be what could co-exist with humans, and then what produced descendents. And his point is, look, if you look at rats, which followed people around from very early on, you know, first the Polynesians, then the Europeans brought a different species of rat to a lot of these places. So there are now rats on islands that never ever had rats before. And they've done incredibly well, you know, they've often eaten through a lot of other species. And his point is they are obviously survivors. They do very well in areas of human disturbance. And maybe their descendents, they could diversify. They could become big. They could become tiny. They could lead to all sorts of new species in the future. And he points out in one of his books let's imagine just for the sake of argument a rat that lives in a cave, clothes itself in the skin of other mammals, and that reminds us of a species that we all know. GROSS: Your previous book was about climate change. That came out in 2006 and that book is very related to your book about the sixth extinction because climate change is such a factor in the extinctions that we're already starting to see. But when you look back eight years ago to when the book was published, what changes have you seen in that interim connected to climate change? KOLBERT: Changes you mean to the physical planet? GROSS: To the physical planet. It's a very short amount of time. KOLBERT: Yeah. GROSS: But, you know, a lot has happened. A lot of measurable things have happened in that eight years. KOLBERT: Absolutely. Yeah. Well, one thing that's happened, I think maybe the most vivid thing that's happened was when I was writing that book people were looking at the Arctic sea ice and I went to talk to people who studied the Arctic sea ice. And I went to see the Arctic sea ice. And when I was writing the book - so that's, you know, roughly a decade ago - there were climate model predictions saying based on, you know, what we see in the models we think that the Arctic Ocean could be ice free in summertime. So there'd be no ice cap in the Arctic Ocean in summer by towards the end of this century. And since then the Arctic ice cap has melted at such an astonishing rate that you now have people saying we could have an ice-free Arctic Ocean, so the North Pole would just, you know, be open water in the summertime, within the next few decades. So that's one change that has happened, you know, way faster even than people anticipated and a very, very dramatic one. GROSS: What's your reaction when you see people debating whether climate change actually exists and whether it's man - whether it has been created by, you know, human activity? KOLBERT: Well, I guess my reaction is, you know, frustration on the one hand and sadness on the other because it's just evidently clear what's going on. The physics of it - the geophysics of it are abundantly clear. They were already understood, you know, back in the 1850s and in the 1890s you already had the scientist - he was in fact a Nobel Prize winning scientist named Svante Arrhenius made predictions about what was going to happen if we kept, you know, adding CO2 to the atmosphere. Now, he was off on his predictions in a lot of ways, in fact, because we've added CO2 - in part because we've added CO2 to the atmosphere so much faster than he could even have imagined. So the fact that we're sort of debating what the effects of adding CO2 to the atmosphere are, you know, 150 years after people understood the effects of adding CO2 to the atmosphere is sort of sad. And what we should be debating, to the extent that we should be debating anything, is what we should do about it. We shouldn't be debating whether this is having an impact because as you see the Arctic ice cap melt away which is, you know, exactly what was predicted by climate models, even if they were somewhat too conservative, you shouldn't really be debating anymore whether climate change is having an effect. GROSS: So I think a lot of people will say, well, look. This is the sixth extinction. So there were five others. They killed off the dinosaurs and, you know, a lot of other, you know, animals that we would call prehistoric. So another extinction? That's probably part of nature's course. There's already been five extinctions so why should we be panicking about a sixth? You know, this is obviously the way the cycle works. (LAUGHTER)KOLBERT: Well, if you want to take that sort of philosophical view, the grand, grand philosophical view, I guess on some level I say, OK, go for it. But I want to point out that in a mass extinction, one of the things that seems to happen is that the whole rules, you know, of life change and so you don't know what's going to come out at the end of that. And another point that I would make to people who want to take, you know, just the sort of 500 million yearlong view is after a mass extinction it often takes about - or it has generally tended to take - many millions of years for life to recover. It's not something that, you know, you bounce back from just from one day to the next. So I don't really think, you know, given a choice people would say well, that's the period I want to live in, a period of mass extinction. GROSS: Thank you so much for talking with us. KOLBERT: Oh, thanks for having me. GROSS: Elizabeth Kolbert is a staff writer for The New Yorker. Her new book is called \"The Sixth Extinction. \" You can read the prologue on our website freshair. npr. org. This is FRESH AIR. TERRY GROSS, HOST:  This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. We're living in an epoch many scientists describe as the sixth extinction. The fifth extinction was the one that killed off the dinosaurs. Scientists now think an asteroid was responsible for that mass extinction, but this time around, human activity is responsible, or as one scientist put it, this time we're the asteroid. My guest, Elizabeth Kolbert, is the author of the new book \"The Sixth Extinction. \" It begins with a history of the big five extinctions of the past and goes on to explain how human behavior is creating the sixth, including our use of fossil fuels, which has led to climate change. Climate change was the subject of Kolbert's previous book, \"Field Notes from a Catastrophe. \" Her research for the new book took her around the world to oceans, rainforests and mountains, as well as a place nearly in her backyard, where scientists are studying die-offs of plants and animals. Elizabeth Kolbert, welcome to FRESH AIR. So when we're talking about the sixth extinction, what are we talking about? What are the species that are likely to become extinct or that have already become extinct? What is dying off? ELIZABETH KOLBERT: Well, when you're talking about an extinction event, the definition I suppose would be many, many organisms across many, many different groups. And, you know, that is really what we are seeing, and that is what make scientists fear, I suppose you'd say the word, that we're in a mass extinction. You're seeing mammals, about a quarter of all mammals are considered endangered, for example; about 40 percent of amphibians are considered endangered, but we're also seeing organisms - invertebrates for example, are endangered; for example reef-building corals, many species of reef-building corals are now considered very, very endangered. So you're seeing extinctions across a wide variety of groups, and that I think would have to be, you know, one of the defining characteristics of a mass extinction. GROSS: I think of carbon emissions as affecting the atmosphere. But you write about how it's also affecting the oceans and life within oceans. How are greenhouse gases affecting the acidity of oceans? KOLBERT: Well that's (unintelligible) that I think is not as fully appreciated as it should be, and it's sort of one of the reasons, even, you could say that I wrote the book. And that is people are pretty aware now of what CO2 emissions, you know, tailpipe emissions do to the atmosphere. They warm the atmosphere. The Earth is getting warmer. There's, you know, no doubt about that. But what happens when you put CO2 into the air is that you're also effectively pumping it into the oceans because wherever the surface of the oceans and atmosphere meet, there's just an exchange of gases. So about a third of the CO2 that we put up every year, and that's on the order of, you know, 10 billion metric tons, is making its way into the oceans. And when CO2 dissolves in water, it forms an acid. It's called carbonic acid. It's a very weak acid, and you're drinking it, for example, when you drink a Coke. And it's that little bit of acidity that give soft drinks what's sometimes called their zest. You know, and it's one of the reasons we don't like to drink soft drinks that are flat, that they taste very treacley(ph). But you do that on a massive enough scale, and you are changing the chemistry of the ocean. You're turning the water more and more acidic, for those who remember their high school chemistry lowering the pH of the water. And that's exactly what we're doing. And if you're a marine organism, and you think about it, you're in the water, you're completely - everything that - your whole environment is the water. And then when you change the chemistry of the water, that can have very, very profound effects. GROSS: Which is why you say ocean acidification is sometimes referred to as global warming's evil twin. KOLBERT: Yeah, global warming's equally evil twin, exactly. And from the perspective of, you know, the broad expanse of life, there have been a few moments in time where the oceans have become acidified, not necessarily acidic but acidified, so more and more acidified, and they are associated with some of the major crises in the history of life. GROSS: To help you understand the impact of the acidification of the oceans, you went to a tiny island that has naturally occurring gas bubbles, and there's carbon dioxide in those gas bubbles. So what kinds of experiments are going on in this island? KOLBERT: Well that's a really interesting story, and it involves a great guy whom I went out with named Jason Hall-Spencer, who's a British marine biologist. And he came to this idea, just sort of almost by chance. He went swimming off of this tiny island, as you say, and it - which is in the Bay of Naples. It's off of Ischia in Italy. And their CO2, this is an area of a lot of volcanic activity, and their CO2 just coming naturally out of the bottom of the water, just bubbling up. And people like to go swimming there because it's very cool, and it's like sort of swimming in fizzy water or champagne. And some people took him swimming there, and he realized wow, this is a natural experiment in ocean acidification. This is CO2 being pumped into the water from below, and it's very similar to what we're doing, sort of effectively pumping CO2 into the water from above. And if I look at what's happening around here, I will be able to look -effectively look into the future and see what's going to happen if we continue to pump CO2 into the air. And so he did a census around this island of marine creatures as you were far away from these CO2 bubbles and as you got closer and closer. And what he found, and I went out with him, and we went swimming in this frigid water, and you see this amazing tableau where when you're far away from the vents, you're seeing a very vivid, you know, underwater world with sea urchins and barnacles and corals and all - fish and all sorts of things that you expect to see in the Mediterranean. And then as you get closer and closer to the vents, you see less and less until you get to this landscape that looks really like a lunar landscape, where very, very little can survive. So this is sort of like this interesting underwater time machine where we can look into the future of the oceans. GROSS: So if our oceans ended up looking like the area where there's these naturally occurring gas vents are, what would our oceans end up looking like? KOLBERT: Well, his experiments suggest that if we continue, you know, at our present rate of CO2 emissions, then by the end of this century, ocean pH, ocean - will have dropped, or ocean acidity will have increased, depending on how you want to say it, to the point where roughly a third, in his - in this particular ecosystem roughly a third of the organisms drop out when you get to that pH. So you're looking at eliminating a third of the creatures in the ocean for - as a very, very rough estimate. And then as you go on, as you get closer and closer to the vents, so even beyond, you know, what we expect at the end of this century if we just sort of continue beyond that point, then you're getting to a point where, you know, your oceans really start to look sort of like the underwater equivalent of a vacant lot. GROSS: So, you know, if we just want to look at it in a very selfish way, this is going to affect what we eat. KOLBERT: Well, I think that, you know, already, obviously, long before you get to sort of the end of this century and the effects of ocean acidification that he saw, we're already seeing tremendous effects to the ocean from a variety of causes, you know, overfishing, bottom trawling. Global warming is really changing where the oceans are warming very quickly. It's really changing where things can live, what things can live. So yeah, we're definitely seeing changes to what we as people can eat, absolutely. GROSS: Now you also went to the Great Barrier Reef, off the coast of Australia. What were you looking for there? KOLBERT: Well, that was an amazing place, perhaps the most amazing place I've ever been in my life, and I also went with a great group of scientists there. A scientist out of Stanford named Ken Caldeira was running a series of  experiments off of this tiny, tiny little island that just sort of pokes up out of the reef. You're essentially on the reef, and every 12 hours, basically at low tide, people would walk across the reed and just go to collect water samples, from which they were trying to tease out the question of how corals are responding to these changes in ocean chemistry. And to walk across the Great Barrier Reef in the middle of the night is a wonderful, wonderful experience. So one of the sort of ironies of writing this whole book and of this whole project was I got to go to these amazing places and see the most amazing creatures in the process of looking at how humans are affecting the world. So you'd sort of go to the ends of the Earth, and yet still what you were looking at was how humans are affecting this place. GROSS: So how are humans affecting the Great Barrier Reef? KOLBERT: Well, humans are affecting the Great Barrier Reef. In this particular case what they were looking at was how this input of CO2, so how the changes in ocean chemistry, people had measured the rate at which the reef was sort of you could say putting on weight, so growing, a couple decades ago, back in the '70s. And they were looking at the rate at which the reef was growing now. And one of the impacts that's predicted from ocean acidification, just due to sort of basic, you know, chemistry, you don't even have to do any experiments really, is that it's going to be harder and harder for any organism that makes a shell or an external skeleton like a coral out of the mineral calcium carbonate. It's going to get harder and harder for them to do that. And that is exactly what people are finding. That's what they found on One Tree Island, that the rate at which the reef was growing has declined substantially. And as this process continues, so as the ocean acidification increases, that rate is going to slow and slow until the point, which is unfortunately not very far in the future, where it seems that corals will no longer be able to keep up with basically the forces that are trying to wear them down, which is everything from organisms that eat away, fish that eat away at the reef and just wave action. And then you're looking at the basically collapse of the whole ecosystem, the reef ecosystem, which supports an extraordinary array of creatures, as anyone who's ever seen, you know, any underwater footage of a coral reef knows, and as I saw when I was out on the Great Barrier Reef, it's just this extraordinary, you know, Jacques Cousteau-esque picture that unfolds under your eyes when you're looking down into the water. GROSS: So this is going to sound like a horrible question, but, you know, I don't get to see barrier reefs, I don't get to see coral, I live in the city. What impact does it have on my life if coral reefs can't grow anymore and if they start declining because of the acidification of the oceans? KOLBERT: Well, I guess I'd give you two answers. The first answer is, you know, we are effectively undoing, you know, the beauty and the variety and the richness of the world, which has taken tens of millions of years to reach this point. We're sort of unraveling that. And if that is something that you just say, well, I don't care about, then I guess I'd say, well, what do you care about. (LAUGHTER) KOLBERT: But on another, on a more, you know, personal sort of like I want to know how - you know, what's it mean to me, I guess my answer would be we're not sure. You know, no one's - we haven't done this before. You don't get to sort of see this experiment run over and over again. So we're doing, it's often said, a massive experiment on the planet, and we really don't know what the end point's going to be. GROSS: OK, that's actually a very impressive answer because who knows, right. KOLBERT: Right, exactly. And I think one of the lessons and one of the points of writing the book, as well, is one of the lessons of the mass extinctions of the past is that very dominant organisms - I mean, the dinosaurs, as people point out, we like to think of the dinosaurs, you know, we even use the word dinosaur to mean some sort of lumbering idiot, you know, something that's obsolete. The dinosaurs were not obsolete. The dinosaurs were not doing anything wrong. They were just unfortunate. And the rules of the game changed very suddenly, and they were gone. And we're not sure why dinosaurs are gone, but they seem to have had some vulnerability to what happened in this extinction event. And we don't know what the end result of what we're doing is. But the rules - if the rules of the game change, you know, then you could sort of - I guess you could say all bets are off at that point. GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is Elizabeth Kolbert. She writes about science for the New Yorker. Her new book is called \"The Sixth Extinction: An Unnatural History,\" and it's about how global change and other manmade changes to the environment are, scientists say, creating a new mass extinction. Let's take a short break here; then we'll talk some more. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GROSS: This is FRESH AIR, and if you're just joining us, my guest is Elizabeth Kolbert. She writes about science for the New Yorker. Her previous book was about global warming. Her new book is about how the impact of global warming and other manmade changes to the earth and the atmosphere are creating what scientists are calling a sixth extinction, a mass number of species has become or is on the verge of becoming extinct. No one knows exactly where this will lead, but her book is about ongoing experiments and studies to try to understand this new extinction. And it's also about the histories of the previous mass extinctions. You write that amphibians are the world's most endangered class of animals and that some scientists argue that an extinction that is catastrophic for amphibians is already underway. So let's start with a real basic question here. Like explain what comes under the category of amphibian. KOLBERT: Well, frogs, toads, salamanders and this very, very interesting, weird, limbless class of creatures that we very rarely see in the temperate zone and that in fact you very rarely see even in the tropics called caecilians. Those are the three groups of amphibians. GROSS: And I've been reading about, like, frog extinctions, mysterious, like, mass frog deaths for years. And were frogs among the first of the amphibians to really be noticed as dying off? KOLBERT: Yes, absolutely, what's become known as the amphibian crisis first came to the notice of scientists when people went out in places that they had always found, you know, huge numbers of frogs and toads, who are, you know, related, and just couldn't find them, just literally could not find them, places where - you know, in for example in the Sierras, one scientist told me that he went to a place where in his own youth, in his own graduate student days, you could go up there, and you couldn't avoid these frogs. You could practically not avoid stepping on them. And they went up there, and they just couldn't find any. GROSS: In fact you went to a place that used to be filled with golden frogs, and they've disappeared. KOLBERT: Yeah, that's a very fascinating and amazing story, which is this is in Panama, in central Panama. There's a frog known as the Panamanian golden frog. And it's a beautiful, beautiful frog. It's sort of a taxicab yellow frog with very skinny arms and legs. And it's considered a good luck symbol. It was often printed on, like, lottery tickets in Panama. And there were places that you could go where these yellow frogs were just all over. One herpetologist described it to me as just crazy. You know, they were just everywhere sunning themselves. They like to sun themselves. And then this scourge came through, which turns out to be a fungus, a fungal disease, and just wiped them out. And what happened is that scientists realized because they had seen this pattern before, they actually anticipated this, and they took some of them out of the forest into a conservation center in central Panama, just like basically an ark. And they are breeding them there. They're still there. There are still Panamanian golden frogs in this center, but they cannot go back out into the world, into their own native habitat, because this fungus is still there, and the fungus survives even though the frogs no longer do. GROSS: Now is the fungus a result of human activity? KOLBERT: Well, that is - certainly seems to be the case because this fungal disease appeared, interestingly enough, in many really disparate parts of the world at the same time, and that's what really had people scratching their heads back in the early '90s. You know, how do we get this - these amphibians disappearing in these often very untouched, seemingly untouched places but in very different parts of the world, you know, in South America, in Australia, you know, oceans away. And so people have surmised that it must have been something that was moved around the world by people because, you know, a fungus really can't cross the oceans. And one theory, it's been very difficult to pin down, but one theory is that this fungus was moved around the world, another really interesting story, on frogs that were used in the '50s and '60s for pregnancy tests, something called the African clawed frog. If you inject it with the urine of a woman who's pregnant, it will lay eggs very quickly, and obstetricians used to keep whole tanks of these frogs in their offices, and the African clawed frog turns out to be a frog that carries this fungus but doesn't seem to be killed by it. So one theory is that as these frogs were imported, or exported I guess you'd say, all around the world, they carried this fungus with them. They were subsequently sometimes maybe, you know, let go by an obstetrician who didn't want them anymore. They established themselves in various places, and maybe they brought it around the world. So we brought the frogs, and the frogs brought the fungus. GROSS: Wow. (LAUGHTER) KOLBERT: Yeah, it's. . . GROSS: I didn't even know that - I've heard of the rabbit test, where you injected a woman's urine into a rabbit to see if she's pregnant. I've never heard of the frog test. KOLBERT: The frog test. The frog test was very widely used. And if you talk to people who, you know, were around then, you know, there are people who still remember, you went to your obstetrician, and there was a tank of frogs. (LAUGHTER) KOLBERT: Yeah, I know. It sounds - but it's also one of this. . . GROSS: Excuse me. (LAUGHTER) KOLBERT: Yeah, yeah, it's one of those things - talk about unintended consequences to cause a major die-off of a really, really ancient group. I should say amphibians have been around for a really, really long time. GROSS: Yeah, you say amphibians, like they survived the other extinctions. KOLBERT: Yeah, they're tough. They're survivors. They predate, you know, the dinosaurs. And they're still around. And they're being really, really, really hard-hit right now. GROSS: So there's a lot of different species of frogs that have been hit by this, not just the golden frogs that you went to see. KOLBERT: Yeah, there are dozens of species that were probably done in by this fungus, many of them these really colorful tropical frogs that are just beautiful. GROSS: Elizabeth Kolbert will be back in the second half of the show. Her new book is called \"The Sixth Extinction. \" I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross back with Elizabeth Kolbert. We're talking about her new book, \"The Sixth Extinction. \" Scientists believe the fifth extinction - which killed the dinosaurs - was caused by an asteroid. But in the epoch we're living in, the sixth extinction, it's human behavior that's responsible for mass die-offs of plants, animals and insects. As we're about to hear, one of the contributing factors is human travel. Kolbert is a staff writer for The New Yorker. Her previous book was about climate change. Because we are so mobile, especially with air travel now, we've been moving around plants and animals, insects and bacteria and viruses, and we've been doing this voluntarily and involuntarily in our travels, totally, you know, reshaping certain aspects of the ecosystems of the world. And you say that scientists are describing the era we're in as the New Pangaea. Tell us what the original Pangaea was. KOLBERT: The original Pangaea - and this is, you know, taking a very long view here -the original Pangaea was a supercontinent, it's called a supercontinent. And it was this interesting moment in geological history about 300 million years ago to about 200 million years ago - let's say very roughly - where all of the world's land masses sort of due to plate tectonics just, you know, cruised into each other and crashed into each other and you had basically all the land in the world in one clump. And that was Pangaea. GROSS: And why is this being called the New Pangaea? KOLBERT: Well, it's, if you take the very long view once again, then you realize that since Pangaea began to break up, all of these evolutionary lineages have been evolving separately on separate continents for, you know, roughly 200 million years, let's say. And so they've taken different paths. This is something that, you know, was very important to Darwin. Darwin looked at that different continents and he saw that they had different fauna, even though, say, their climate and their terrain were very similar, so parts of South America were very similar in that sense to parts of Australia, but they had completely different flora and fauna and that was because they've been evolving separately for such a long time. He didn't understand plate tectonics but he knew that they'd been separated - that they were separated. And now what we're doing, if you are taking the flora and faunas, so the plants and animals of South America and you're moving them to Australia and vice versa - and we see this all around, you know, lots of Asian species in the U. S. now, lots of North American species in Europe, lots of European species in Australia. You're effectively recombining the continents and bringing these evolutionary lineages back together, and very, very quickly, from one day to the next, OK? So after, you know, tens of millions of years of evolving separately, we say, OK, one day we're going to, you know, see what happens when we throw you together. And when you do do that, it turns out sometimes nothing happens, but sometimes very, very catastrophic things happen. GROSS: Give us an example of something catastrophic. KOLBERT: Well, a good example often comes from islands, day. So there's a very famous example on the island of Guam. Something called the brown tree snake was introduced from New Guinea probably during World War I in military cargo. It was brought to Guam and it went absolutely, you know, sort of berserk. It had no enemies. One thing that happens when you move something around is it probably may not have any natural predators, so the brown tree snake had no predators in Guam, and Guam itself lacked any animal and it's only snake was this, you know, tiny little wormlike thing. And so it's birds, there were a lot of bird that fell victim to it. It's a very, very voracious snake, it turns out. It went wild, multiplied until there were something like 40 snakes per acre, killed off a lot of the island's native birds, a lot of reptiles were affected, the bats were affected, so the snake just came in and took what's sometimes called naive populations. This is especially true on islands and basically wiped them out. GROSS: The idea of humans moving around species and bacteria and viruses and so on to places where they didn't naturally occur, that's nothing new. I mean there's something that's now known as the Columbian Exchange, like when Columbus and other explorers went to different parts of the world - including the Americas - they brought plants and animals with them to the continents that they were exploring and then brought back home plants and animals from the continents they had explored. So this whole idea of moving around the ecosystem is centuries old. KOLBERT: Absolutely. This is not, I mean a lot of, one of the points I also, you know, sort of hope comes through in the book is this is not a new project that humans are embarked upon. And exactly, we can go back to pre-Colombian times. We can go back to for example, people reached Australia, you know, 50,000 years ago - which is an ,amazing fact that people reached Australia 50,000 years ago. But they found this sort of amazing cast of huge animals - huge birds, huge kangaroos, huge wombat-like creatures that are known as rhinoceros wombat that sort of look like, you know, enormous guinea pigs, let's say, and they are no longer there. You know, so people have been at this world-altering project for quite a while now. And when the first, in terms of bringing species around the world, for example, rats were brought with very early Polynesian settlers in the Pacific, so they were brought to, you know, places like Fiji and they wreaked havoc. They wreaked absolute havoc already, you know, say, 1,500 years ago. So you're absolutely right, this is not a project that we've suddenly embarked upon, but I think what has changed is the scale and the rate. For example, it's been estimated that just in ship ballast now in our enormous supertankers, people are moving 10,000 species a day around the world. So even though our ancestors, you know, were already at this project, and did caused significant effects because of that and significant numbers of extinctions, we have just ramped it up to a whole new level. GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is Elizabeth Kolbert. She writes about science for The New Yorker. She's the author of a new book called \"The Sixth Extinction,\" and it's about what many scientists believe is a mass extinction that is now underway, that is as important as previous extinctions, like the mass extinction of dinosaurs. Kolbert's previous book was about climate change. Elizabeth, let's take a short break and then we'll talk some more. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. My guest is Elizabeth Kolbert. She writes about science for \"The New Yorker. \" Her new book is called \"The Sixth Extinction,\" and it's about what many scientists believe is a mass extinction that we are beginning to experience, that's affecting life in the ocean and on land. Her previous book was about climate change. She writes about science for The New Yorker. You know, when we look at the big picture about how ecosystems are changing and how many, you know, species are becoming extinct, if you look at the big picture, there's the catastrophe, you know, whether it's like, you know, a glacial - glacially caused die-off or an asteroid, you know, caused series of extinctions or, you know, climate change, global warming, but then there's also, you know, evolution. Evolution is a very, very slow process of adaptation and catastrophe is a much kind of quicker and sudden dramatic change. So how did catastrophe and evolution coexist or balance each other or not balance each other? KOLBERT: Well, that's a really, I mean really interesting question, and how people have come to look at the whole history of the world as this interesting - as I quote one paleontologist describing it, as long periods of boredom interrupted occasionally by panic. (LAUGHTER) KOLBERT: And the history of, you know, how we came to see the world this way, that is the history of science in that sense, that's part - that's a story that I sort of open the book with in a way. And that dates all the way back to the beginning of the 19th century when the whole history, the whole concept of extinction was in a way discovered. And what's interesting is before that, people really didn't even think there was such a thing as extinction. They couldn't imagine that the creator would create something that wouldn't be around forever. So when people started to find really interesting things, mastodon bones, mammoth bones, they just assumed that those creatures were out there somewhere. And in fact Thomas Jefferson, when he sent Lewis and Clark out to the American Northwest, he really hoped that they were going to find live mastodons roaming around out there because he really could not accept the fact that they were gone. And it was a French naturalist who said, you know, that's ridiculous. Obviously they're gone, these creatures are extinct. And he really - his name is Georges Cuvier, he's a very fascinating character. He really invented - as it were - the concept of extinction. And he thought all extinctions were caused in these catastrophic changes. And then Darwin and his - Darwin's mentor, a man named Charles Lyle, came along, and they completely dismissed the idea that you could have catastrophes. They decided that the Earth changed very, very slowly and only very slowly. They made a slight sort of logical leap there. It changed slowly and it could only change slowly. So the idea of catastrophe really was discredited. We just didn't get events like that. And it was only pretty recently, in the '80s, when it was discovered by a scientist named Walter Alvarez, who is out of Berkeley, that an asteroid impact was what had done in the dinosaurs, and that was extremely controversial at the time and now very well accepted, that this concept that we could get catastrophic change on the Earth was accepted, and now I think the general sort of sense, which, you know, is sort of a hybrid of the two, is that, yes, the world changes very, very slowly, except at certain moments when it doesn't. And it seems that we are in one of those moments when it is in fact changing very, very fast and, of course, we are the agent for that. GROSS: So when you look at the mass extinctions, what do scientists say about the odds that humans are going to survive? KOLBERT: Well, I. . . (LAUGHTER) KOLBERT: I sort of pointedly try to avoid that question. I mean I think if you were, you know, saying, well, what's going to survive an event that humans have set in motion, I guess you would bet on humans. We're very, very clever. We're very technologically able. There are a lot of us. There's, you know, right now about 7. 2 billion of us and if we continue on the trajectory we're on, you know, there are one of the nine or 10 billion soon. So if you were sort of just betting what creature, you know, would survive this, I think you would bet on humans. But as I said before, one of the very, very sobering things about looking back at the mass extinctions of the past is that when the rules change you don't really know what's going to happen. So I guess you'd say if you were a species, you know, causing a mass extinction, you wouldn't necessarily feel entirely secure. GROSS: One scientist is predicting that it's rats who will one day take over the Earth. KOLBERT: Yeah. That's a wonderful, I mean I should say that's part. . . GROSS: Did you say wonderful? (LAUGHTER) KOLBERT: Well, it's a wonderful, it's a wonderful idea. It's a very graphic, vivid idea, I think, that captures people's imagination. And I should say it's partly tongue-in-cheek, but partly not. And that idea comes from a geologist that I went out with named Jan Zalasiewicz. And he is in fact leading this whole effort to assess whether we should formally name a new geological epoch, whether we live now in the Anthropocene, and he has written about looking into the future. Because part of what we're doing, which is, you know, interesting and also very sobering, is we're closing off certain evolutionary paths, but we're also opening up certain evolutionary paths, right? So what is going to populate the planet millions and millions of years from now is going to be what could co-exist with humans, and then what produced descendents. And his point is, look, if you look at rats, which followed people around from very early on, you know, first the Polynesians, then the Europeans brought a different species of rat to a lot of these places. So there are now rats on islands that never ever had rats before. And they've done incredibly well, you know, they've often eaten through a lot of other species. And his point is they are obviously survivors. They do very well in areas of human disturbance. And maybe their descendents, they could diversify. They could become big. They could become tiny. They could lead to all sorts of new species in the future. And he points out in one of his books let's imagine just for the sake of argument a rat that lives in a cave, clothes itself in the skin of other mammals, and that reminds us of a species that we all know. GROSS: Your previous book was about climate change. That came out in 2006 and that book is very related to your book about the sixth extinction because climate change is such a factor in the extinctions that we're already starting to see. But when you look back eight years ago to when the book was published, what changes have you seen in that interim connected to climate change? KOLBERT: Changes you mean to the physical planet? GROSS: To the physical planet. It's a very short amount of time. KOLBERT: Yeah. GROSS: But, you know, a lot has happened. A lot of measurable things have happened in that eight years. KOLBERT: Absolutely. Yeah. Well, one thing that's happened, I think maybe the most vivid thing that's happened was when I was writing that book people were looking at the Arctic sea ice and I went to talk to people who studied the Arctic sea ice. And I went to see the Arctic sea ice. And when I was writing the book - so that's, you know, roughly a decade ago - there were climate model predictions saying based on, you know, what we see in the models we think that the Arctic Ocean could be ice free in summertime. So there'd be no ice cap in the Arctic Ocean in summer by towards the end of this century. And since then the Arctic ice cap has melted at such an astonishing rate that you now have people saying we could have an ice-free Arctic Ocean, so the North Pole would just, you know, be open water in the summertime, within the next few decades. So that's one change that has happened, you know, way faster even than people anticipated and a very, very dramatic one. GROSS: What's your reaction when you see people debating whether climate change actually exists and whether it's man - whether it has been created by, you know, human activity? KOLBERT: Well, I guess my reaction is, you know, frustration on the one hand and sadness on the other because it's just evidently clear what's going on. The physics of it - the geophysics of it are abundantly clear. They were already understood, you know, back in the 1850s and in the 1890s you already had the scientist - he was in fact a Nobel Prize winning scientist named Svante Arrhenius made predictions about what was going to happen if we kept, you know, adding CO2 to the atmosphere. Now, he was off on his predictions in a lot of ways, in fact, because we've added CO2 - in part because we've added CO2 to the atmosphere so much faster than he could even have imagined. So the fact that we're sort of debating what the effects of adding CO2 to the atmosphere are, you know, 150 years after people understood the effects of adding CO2 to the atmosphere is sort of sad. And what we should be debating, to the extent that we should be debating anything, is what we should do about it. We shouldn't be debating whether this is having an impact because as you see the Arctic ice cap melt away which is, you know, exactly what was predicted by climate models, even if they were somewhat too conservative, you shouldn't really be debating anymore whether climate change is having an effect. GROSS: So I think a lot of people will say, well, look. This is the sixth extinction. So there were five others. They killed off the dinosaurs and, you know, a lot of other, you know, animals that we would call prehistoric. So another extinction? That's probably part of nature's course. There's already been five extinctions so why should we be panicking about a sixth? You know, this is obviously the way the cycle works. (LAUGHTER) KOLBERT: Well, if you want to take that sort of philosophical view, the grand, grand philosophical view, I guess on some level I say, OK, go for it. But I want to point out that in a mass extinction, one of the things that seems to happen is that the whole rules, you know, of life change and so you don't know what's going to come out at the end of that. And another point that I would make to people who want to take, you know, just the sort of 500 million yearlong view is after a mass extinction it often takes about - or it has generally tended to take - many millions of years for life to recover. It's not something that, you know, you bounce back from just from one day to the next. So I don't really think, you know, given a choice people would say well, that's the period I want to live in, a period of mass extinction. GROSS: Thank you so much for talking with us.

They conjure images of terrifying wood-munching insects that can take down a house. But in Africa and Australia, termites are better known for their feats of construction rather than destruction. Termite colonies can build huge, elaborate mounds that rise up from the ground like insect skyscrapers. As NPR Nell Greenfieldboyce tells us, scientists recently took some lessons from termites to design a team of robot construction workers. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE, BYLINE: Some insects are good at building things, think of a wasp's nest or an underground labyrinth of ant tunnels. But Justin Werfel says those insect homes are nothing compared to a big termite mound. JUSTIN WERFEL: Termites are the real masters of construction in the insect world. The largest termite mound on record was 42 feet tall. GREENFIELDBOYCE: He says each mound has a complicated network of tunnels inside. The overall shape of the amount depends on the species. WERFEL: Some of them have an open chimney in the center and hot air can come rising out of that. Some of them are closed mounds. There are what are called cathedral mounds, they have all these elaborate ridges on the outside like flight buttresses. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Millions of insects were together to build these complex, large-scale structures by doing stuff like pushing bits of mud around. And yet they're not following a blueprint or listening to orders from some termite supervisor. Instead, they seem to sense what's around them and apply some simple rules to decide what to do next. That's what inspired Werfel and his colleagues at Harvard University to create robot termites. WERFEL: We've created this system of multiple independent robots that build things we ask for. And they do it more like the way insects act than the way that robots normally act. GREENFIELDBOYCE: The robots don't look like termites. They look more like black, mechanical beetles. They're about eight inches long. They have just a few onboard sensors that let them navigate around a work site set up in a lab. Each robot can grab a specially-designed square brick, carry it on its back, and then set it down. Werfel says that he and his team program the robots to follow some simple rules. WERFEL: They build things that are much larger than themselves. They climb on what they are working on building to get to higher places, and they coordinate what they are doing using a tool that termites use. Rather than talk to one another directly, they coordinate indirectly by changing their shared environment. So one puts down some material, another one comes along and reacts to that material, and uses that to help it decide later whether to put more material down. GREENFIELDBOYCE: The termite-inspired robots are described in the journal Science. Researchers show how programming the robots to follow different sets of rules can produce a variety of structures, from castles to pyramids. So far, the robots have only made modest structures and they do it slowly. For example, they built one that's shaped like a trident. WERFEL: And that involves only eight bricks and that takes half an hour. GREENFIELDBOYCE: The vision is that, someday, swarms of robots could stack up sandbags to protect against flooding, or go to Mars and build living quarters for astronauts. That's still a long way off. But this study is a proof of principle that robots can work together like termites to build complex structures. And Hod Lipson says that's a big deal. He's an engineer at Cornell University who specializes in robotics. HOD LIPSON: It's one of these things where the idea has been around for a while, that you can have robots cooperate to construct something larger than themselves, but no one has really been able to get that to work. And it's not because of any specific detail, but it's sort of coordinating everything together.

These ancient migrants are believed to be the distant ancestors of the people who spread across North and South America in the millennia before Europeans arrived, from the Inuit to the Cherokee to the Maya and many more. Now that story is bolstered with some dramatic ancient DNA. Scientists say they have decoded the genome of a baby who died in present-day Montana more than 12,000 years ago. NPR's Richard Harris reports. RICHARD HARRIS, BYLINE: The baby, a one year old boy, is the only human skeleton known from a brief but prolific culture in the Americas called Clovis. MICHAEL WATERS: Clovis is what we like to refer to as an archeological complex. HARRIS: Michael Waters at Texas A&M says that complex is a set of tools made of bone and stone. Those artifacts were common for about 400 years, starting about 13,000 years ago. There is only one set of human remains associated with those tools - an infant who was buried along with more than 100 artifacts in present day Montana. Now scientists have been able to read the DNA taken from that precious discovery. WATERS: So this genetic study actually provides us with a look at who these people were. HARRIS: The most obvious conclusion from the study, reported in Nature magazine, is that the Clovis people who lived on the Anzick site in Montana were genetically very much like Native Americans throughout the western hemisphere. ESKE WILLERSLEV: The Anzick family is directly ancestral to so many peoples in the Americas. I mean, that's astonishing. HARRIS: Eske Willerslev led the effort to read that genome from his lab in Copenhagen. The genes reveal that early Americans are the product of two lineages that most likely met and interbred in Asia before making the trek across the Bering land bridge. Michael Waters says this helps clarify the relationship among Native Americans. WATERS: So this strongly suggests that there was a single migration of people into the Americas. And these people were probably the people who eventually gave rise to Clovis. HARRIS: This finding contradicts a long-shot hypothesis that that Clovis's ancestors actually came from Europe, not Asia. But it leaves many other questions about Clovis unresolved. The artifacts from this culture are found from Washington State to Florida and many places in between. But the culture also disappeared suddenly, around 12,600 years ago. Waters doesn't find that too mysterious. WATERS: People change all the time and cultures change all the time and technologies change. And they change because people are adapting to new environments and changes in climate. And at the end of the Clovis time period, around 12,600 years ago, when this child was buried, you know, the climate was changing. It was the beginning of the Younger Dryas cold snap. This is when you start seeing a lot of cultural differentiation taking place. HARRIS: The DNA now makes it clear that the people who used Clovis tools lived on, even though they left their old technology behind. But Eske Willerslev says the Clovis genes give only a broad-brush view of how and when migrations throughout the Americas took place. WILLERSLEV: We have no idea exactly where the U. S. fits in this pattern, and to be completely honest, we have no idea how they actually moved through time, these different groups across the continent. In order to answer that question, there's only one way to go, and that is actually sequencing more genomes from ancient remains. HARRIS: That will require, among other things, cooperation with native peoples. In the case of the Clovis child, the archeologists worked closely with modern tribes to make sure they were treating the remains appropriately. They say the Clovis infant will be reburied on the property where he was unearthed later this year. Richard Harris, NPR News.

They use rat bait and other toxic chemicals to protect their plants. NPR's Elizabeth Shogren visited the Hoopa Reservation in Northern California, where tribal members and biologists are worried about the problem. ELIZABETH SHOGREN, BYLINE: We scramble through snow-covered brush on a remote hillside. MARK HIGLEY: Here's a marijuana plant that kept growing after it was cut. SHOGREN: The tribe's biologist, Mark Higley, holds up a rotten pot plant. It's left over from a bust last summer. A law enforcement team found 8,000 marijuana plants here, three to six-feet tall. They also found lots of rat poisons and empty containers left over after growers used the toxic chemicals. Here's what happens. The growers irrigate their plants. Rats chew on the plants to get moisture and that kills the plants. So the growers try to kill the rats. HIGLEY: The problem is we have wild rodents out here that eat the rat poisons, and then they become little time bombs. They don't die for seven to 10 days, maybe two weeks, and they stagger around and then they become easy prey for northern spotted owl, fisher, foxes, bobcats. SHOGREN: And then when predators eat the poisoned rodents, they get poisoned and sometimes die. Higley says this has become a common scene in forests throughout Northern California. That same week in a bust in a national forest nearby, sheriff's deputies found a dead fisher. It's a rare relative of the weasel, about the size of a cat. Higley was there. He says the marijuana growers had laced hotdogs with a toxic insecticide and hung them up on large fishhooks. HIGLEY: And then that fisher had hotdog in its esophagus and in its stomach and died of acute poisoning. SHOGREN: Higley and other biologists study fishers closely because the federal government is considering putting them on the endangered species list. They know what kills them because they tracked them with radio collars. When an animal stops moving, researchers race into the forest to find the body before predators do. In fact, the dead fisher first clued in scientists for the widespread use of these poisons by illegal pot growers. Then researchers went back and looked at tissue samples from fishers that had died in previous years. Nearly all the animals had been exposed to rat poisons. Higley says these poisons cause nearly a third of the deaths of male fishers on the Hoopa Reservation over recent years. HIGLEY: It was just devastating, I mean, to know that such a high percentage of the fisher population across the entire range in California was exposed to these rat poisons and knowing that it's not just fishers, but all the other carnivores got to be exposed to it. It just seems absolutely criminal. SHOGREN: Particularly on the reservation. The Hoopa tribe banned all toxic chemicals decades ago to protect its natural resources. Aaron Pole is a wildlife technician and a member of the tribe. AARON POLE: I'm enraged. Why won't they go somewhere else and grow? SHOGREN: Pole has come across illegal marijuana farms when tracking fishers and rare northern spotted owls. And he's been part of teams cleaning up sites after busts. A big pile of trash is still left over from a clean up here a couple of months ago. It includes empty fertilizer bags and lots of irrigation hose that growers used to bring water from a stream. POLE: It's pretty selfish. You know, it's like they come in and they're reaping the benefit of, you know, some quick cash. All the environmental damage is happening here and we have to deal with it. SHOGREN: The fishers are a special concern because the tribe uses their skins for arrow quivers in a traditional healing dance. The tribe also worries about poisons getting into fish and game and the rivers where children play. Wildlife ecologist Mourad Gabriel is tracking the problem all over the northern half of California. In his lab in a logging town near the coast, he opens a locked freezer and pulls out a corpse of a furry animal. MOURAD GABRIEL: So you can see here, it's still a little frosty but this is a beautiful, beautiful male fisher. SHOGREN: It was found dead near Yosemite National Park hundreds of miles away. Gabriel plans to take it to the University of California, Davis for an examination to determine the cause of death. But these days, whenever a fisher turns up, he suspects rat poisons. He goes in with law enforcement during busts of illegal pot farms, sometimes getting lowered from a helicopter. Afterwards, he hikes back into the spots. He hauls out whatever rat poisons he finds and he sets up motion-sensing cameras. GABRIEL: Just to see what kind of wildlife actually visits these sites. SHOGREN: He shows me pictures of fishers, mountain lions, gray fox, deer and a bear. GABRIEL: This bear is actually walking in and investigating bottles of insecticides and fertilizer. SHOGREN: Gabriel recently got the results from the exam of that frozen fisher from Yosemite. It did die from rat poisons. And then earlier this month, Gabriel suffered a very personal blow. His pet dog was poisoned with the same kind of rat bait and died. He thinks it was malicious. The local sheriff is investigating. Elizabeth Shogren, NPR News.

One chunk exploded over the Russian city of Chelyabinsk with the force of a 500-kiloton bomb. At least 1,000 people were injured. For his series Joe's Big Idea, NPR's Joe Palca reports the asteroid arrived without warning, and some scientists and inventors think it's time to be more proactive, planning for future asteroid strikes. JOE PALCA, BYLINE: Not all asteroid encounters are cataclysmic despite what you see in the movies. (SOUNDBITE OF MOVIE)PALCA: In reality, the objects that hit Earth are quite a bit smaller. Most cause nothing more than a streak in the sky as they burn up in the atmosphere. But since some can be dangerous, NASA and other federal agencies have concluded it's time to adopt the Boy Scout motto: be prepared. Part of being prepared is knowing what's out there, but that's not a trivial problem. There's a lot of sky out there, and asteroids, even big ones, don't necessarily shine brightly. But you can spot them if you happen to have an infrared telescope in space. AMY MAINZER: Instead of seeing sunlight reflecting off of their surfaces, we're actually seeing the heat that they give off. We see them glow, essentially. PALCA: Amy Mainzer is an astronomer at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena and principal investigator for a spacecraft called WISE, which stands for the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer. And guess what? WISE has an infrared telescope. Even though space is a cold place, asteroids that come near Earth are warm. MAINZER: They're sort of orbiting the sun at roughly the same distance as the Earth. So if you think about it, they absorb sunlight, and the sunlight warms them up. PALCA: Making them glow in a way that WISE can see. NASA had actually shut the spacecraft off in 2011 when its main infrared detectors ran out of the coolant they need to work properly, but WISE has other detectors that are good enough to spot nearby asteroids. So NASA decided to switch it back on. Now it's called NeoWISE. Mainzer says it started hunting for asteroids just before last Christmas. MAINZER: Basically six days after we started taking survey data, we found our first new asteroid. PALCA: Right now the job of keeping track of all the stuff that might hit Earth falls to the International Astronomical Union Minor Planet Center. Timothy Spahr is the center director. Spahr says NeoWISE helps with the asteroid hunt in many ways. TIMOTHY SPAHR: One of them is that there will be a few additional discoveries of near-Earth objects. PALCA: But he says more important is that an infrared telescope can tell you how big an object is. SPAHR: Getting the actual size of objects in space is notoriously difficult and effective impossible from ground-based surveys. And so having a space-based infrared telescope provides information that we simply don't get any other way. PALCA: Obviously the big objects are the ones that could cause the most damage, but Mark Boslough thinks it would be a good idea to keep track of the smaller objects, too. Boslough is a physicist and asteroid impact expert at the Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque. He'd like to see an early warning system for asteroids that might hit Earth, something like what the National Hurricane Center uses to keep an eye out for dangerous storms. MARK BOSLOUGH: I would propose a very similar system, where you have a survey to look at the sky, look for small objects, even small enough to not do any damage whatsoever, and you find these advance - hours, days, weeks in advance - and you issue an appropriate warning. PALCA: Now an early warning about a Texas-sized asteroid that's going to destroy all life on Earth may not be all that helpful. But knowing about a smaller object could be. Boslough says the object that exploded over the Russian city of Chelyabinsk a year ago is an example of that. BOSLOUGH: If we had discovered that in advance, we could have issued a warning, and we could have probably saved thousands of people from getting injured. PALCA: The biggest chunk of that object exploded 20 miles up, so it didn't cause direct damage, but it did create a huge shock wave. Boslough says there's simple advice to prevent injuries in that instance. BOSLOUGH: You just tell people to stay away from windows. PALCA: And there were thousands of people. . . BOSLOUGH: There were over 1,000 people, yeah, that were injured, you know, some very seriously from flying glass. PALCA: Boslough admits it would be expensive to build that kind of early warning system, but it might just be cheaper and easier than calling in Bruce Willis and his pals to blow up a Texas-sized asteroid.

But first, could the key to happiness be through science? MATT KILLINGSWORTH: Most of what we know about happiness is, you know, what a scientist might call correlational research. RAZ: Matt Killingsworth is a scientist who. . . KILLINGSWORTH: Studies the causes and nature of human happiness. RAZ: Like, why are we happy at particular moments and unhappy at other ones? Well, to study that question, you've got to ask lots of people how they're feeling. KILLINGSWORTH: We can look at to what extent - are richer people happier, are people with children happier, are unemployed people less happy, etc. But it's hard to know for sure what's causing what. And it's even harder to know what can people actually change and have an impact in their lives. RAZ: You know, like, when someone asks you, how was your week, I mean, you don't think about specific things throughout your week that might've made you happy or not. And why. . . KILLINGSWORTH: The kinds of happiness that you feel when you are interacting with your kids might be very different than the kind of happiness you experience when you're eating a great dinner. RAZ: And scientists, obviously, can't be with you all the time to know the difference. So about five years ago, Matt Killingsworth came up with an idea to solve this fundamental problem of happiness research - your smart phone, or specifically, an app on your smart phone. KILLINGSWORTH: And the basic idea behind this is that we can now use technology to measure happiness in real time. RAZ: So here's how it works. You go to trackyourhappiness. org, punch in your phone number. And then later, when you're, say, on the subway, you get a text. KILLINGSWORTH: And the idea is that you want to respond as fast as you can and tell me about your experience at the instant right before you got that text message. RAZ: And suddenly, it's like a therapist in your iPhone with some questions. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: First question, how do you feel right now? RAZ: And on a sliding scale from very good to very bad, you could say, you know, about in the middle. MAN: Next question, do you have to do what you're doing? Yes or no? RAZ: And you're like, yep, definitely yes. And then the questions get more detailed. MAN: To what extent are you being productive? What time did you go to sleep last night? When did you finish eating your most recent meal today? RAZ: And then finally. . . MAN: Last question, do you want to do what you're doing? Yes or no? RAZ: And here's the moment where you think, maybe I'm not. Maybe this isn't what I want to be doing right now. KILLINGSWORTH: I find myself, and a lot of people tell me, that you become much more aware of how happy you are, of how you spend your time of, you know, a lot of the dimensions that we measure like, you know, whether you want to be doing what you're doing. RAZ: Anyway, more on that later. But the point is, several times a day, Matt sends these texts to thousands of people. KILLINGSWORTH: Maybe 35,000 people who've done it. RAZ: Wherever they are. KILLINGSWORTH: At home or at work or in a vehicle, in a coffee shop, restaurant. . . RAZ: Basically, anywhere people find themselves Matt wants to be measuring. KILLINGSWORTH: Their happiness and details of what they're doing at that moment. RAZ: And all this adds up to a kind of statistical survey of happiness data because what Matt is doing, he's vacuuming up all kinds of information that no one else has ever really analyzed before. And he looks for patterns. KILLINGSWORTH: I can look across all of these dimensions of our lives - who we spend our time with, how we think about ourselves and other people, how well we sleep, how much we exercise - I mean, a tremendous number of variables. RAZ: Variables that might be starting to add up. KILLINGSWORTH: Over time, into an equation for happiness. RAZ: And whether there is such a thing, that's a debate Matt took on in his TED Talk. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)KILLINGSWORTH: Well, since I'm a scientist, I'd like to try to resolve this debate with some data. And in particular, I'd like to present some data to you from three questions that I asked with Track Your Happiness. Remember, this is from sort of moment-to-moment experience in people's real lives. There are three questions. The first one is a happiness question - how do you feel on a scale ranging from very bad to very good? Second, an activity question - what are you doing on a list of 22 different activities including things like eating and working and watching TV. And finally, a mind wandering question - are you thinking about something other than what you're currently doing? People could say no. In other words, I'm focused only on my task, or yes, I am thinking about something else. And the topic of those thoughts are pleasant, neutral or unpleasant. Any of those yes responses are what we called mind wandering. So what did we find? As it turns out, people are substantially less happy when their minds are wandering than when they're not. Now you might look at this result and say, OK, sure. On average, people are less happy when they're mind wandering. But surely, when their mind's are straying away from something that wasn't very enjoyable to begin with, at least then mind wandering should be doing something good for us. Nope. As it turns out, people are less happy when they're mind wandering no matter what they're doing. For example, people don't really like commuting to work very much. It's one of their least enjoyable activities. And yet, they are substantially happier when they're focused only on their commute than when their mind is going off to something else. It's amazing. So how could this be happening? I think part of the reason, a big part of the reason, is that when our minds wander, we often think about unpleasant things. And they are enormously less happy when they do that - our worries, our anxieties, our regrets. Forty-seven percent of the time, people are thinking about something other than what they're currently doing. Ranging from a high of 65 percent when people are taking a shower, brushing their teeth to 50 percent when they're working to 40 percent when they're exercising, all the way down to this one short bar on the right that I think some of you are probably laughing at. Ten percent of the time, people's minds are wandering when they're having sex. But there's something I think that's quite interesting in this graph, and that is, basically, with one exception, no matter what people are doing, they're mind wandering at least 30 percent of the time, which suggests I think that mind wandering isn't just frequent, it's ubiquitous. It pervades basically everything that we do. In other words, mind wandering very likely seems to be an actual cause and not merely a consequence of unhappiness. RAZ: And that's the single biggest determinant? Like, you can say, without question, the most consistent result we have is that when your mind wanders, you're less happy. KILLINGSWORTH: Exactly. I think our ability to mind wander is kind of a superpower. The ability for human beings to think about something other than what they're doing allows them to plan and reason and do a lot of really amazing things that make us, you know, such a successful species. But it's a superpower we can't really control in the sense that we use it really often for things that aren't very helpful for us. And that's one of the surprising results in my research is that when I look across all the different activities that people engage in, they are universally happier when they're fully engaged in that activity and not mind wandering no matter what they're doing. RAZ: So when they're in the moment? KILLINGSWORTH: When they're in the moment. Exactly. RAZ: How do you do that? Like, how do you get to that place? KILLINGSWORTH: That's the million-dollar question. And I don't know the answer. I think it is possible for people to redirect their attention. One thing I've certainly started doing since I've begun this research is notice where my attention is. And when I do find it straying, especially if I'm mind wandering about something that's not really productive or useful or adding to my experience, to just bring my attention back to whatever I'm doing and to do that repeatedly. And when I do that, I can not only sort of turn off mind wandering, but I think really enjoy that experience a lot more. RAZ: I mean, do you think that's, like, science - like, what you're researching could ultimately give us a formula to find happiness? KILLINGSWORTH: I think it can make a lot of progress. This is a question that people have been thinking about for thousands of years. And there are some recurring answers like treating other people like you would like to be treated. But at the same time, I think there are just a lot of debates that haven't really been resolved. And it's really hard to resolve them when it's just people talking at each other. And I think that is really the power of science is to use the scientific method and collect data and figure our who's right. You know, in the same way that we've stood on the shoulders of our ancestors to understand a lot about medicine or the economy, I think we're at the start of a long but I think really exciting journey to understand a lot more about the causes of happiness. RAZ: Matt Killingsworth, he's a researcher at UC-San Francisco. His talk on happiness is at TED. com. And if you want those little happiness texts a couple times a day, checkout trackyourhappiness. org. I got one right at the moment, and I was like, are you doing something you have to be doing right now? And I was like, yes. I'm wiping my 2-year-old's butt. And then it was like, are you doing something you want to be doing? And I was like, yeah, I guess I want to be wiping my 2-year-old's butt 'cause I get to spend time with him.

KILLINGSWORTH: The kinds of happiness that you feel when you are interacting with your kids might be very different than the kind of happiness you experience when you're eating a great dinner. RAZ: And scientists, obviously, can't be with you all the time to know the difference. So about five years ago, Matt Killingsworth came up with an idea to solve this fundamental problem of happiness research - your smart phone, or specifically, an app on your smart phone. KILLINGSWORTH: And the basic idea behind this is that we can now use technology to measure happiness in real time. RAZ: So here's how it works. You go to trackyourhappiness. org, punch in your phone number. And then later, when you're, say, on the subway, you get a text. KILLINGSWORTH: And the idea is that you want to respond as fast as you can and tell me about your experience at the instant right before you got that text message. RAZ: And suddenly, it's like a therapist in your iPhone with some questions. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: First question, how do you feel right now? RAZ: And on a sliding scale from very good to very bad, you could say, you know, about in the middle. MAN: Next question, do you have to do what you're doing? Yes or no? RAZ: And you're like, yep, definitely yes. And then the questions get more detailed. MAN: To what extent are you being productive? What time did you go to sleep last night? When did you finish eating your most recent meal today? RAZ: And then finally. . . MAN: Last question, do you want to do what you're doing? Yes or no? RAZ: And here's the moment where you think, maybe I'm not. Maybe this isn't what I want to be doing right now. KILLINGSWORTH: I find myself, and a lot of people tell me, that you become much more aware of how happy you are, of how you spend your time of, you know, a lot of the dimensions that we measure like, you know, whether you want to be doing what you're doing. RAZ: Anyway, more on that later. But the point is, several times a day, Matt sends these texts to thousands of people. KILLINGSWORTH: Maybe 35,000 people who've done it. RAZ: Wherever they are. KILLINGSWORTH: At home or at work or in a vehicle, in a coffee shop, restaurant. . . RAZ: Basically, anywhere people find themselves Matt wants to be measuring. KILLINGSWORTH: Their happiness and details of what they're doing at that moment. RAZ: And all this adds up to a kind of statistical survey of happiness data because what Matt is doing, he's vacuuming up all kinds of information that no one else has ever really analyzed before. And he looks for patterns. KILLINGSWORTH: I can look across all of these dimensions of our lives - who we spend our time with, how we think about ourselves and other people, how well we sleep, how much we exercise - I mean, a tremendous number of variables. RAZ: Variables that might be starting to add up. KILLINGSWORTH: Over time, into an equation for happiness. RAZ: And whether there is such a thing, that's a debate Matt took on in his TED Talk. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) KILLINGSWORTH: Well, since I'm a scientist, I'd like to try to resolve this debate with some data. And in particular, I'd like to present some data to you from three questions that I asked with Track Your Happiness. Remember, this is from sort of moment-to-moment experience in people's real lives. There are three questions. The first one is a happiness question - how do you feel on a scale ranging from very bad to very good? Second, an activity question - what are you doing on a list of 22 different activities including things like eating and working and watching TV. And finally, a mind wandering question - are you thinking about something other than what you're currently doing? People could say no. In other words, I'm focused only on my task, or yes, I am thinking about something else. And the topic of those thoughts are pleasant, neutral or unpleasant. Any of those yes responses are what we called mind wandering. So what did we find? As it turns out, people are substantially less happy when their minds are wandering than when they're not. Now you might look at this result and say, OK, sure. On average, people are less happy when they're mind wandering. But surely, when their mind's are straying away from something that wasn't very enjoyable to begin with, at least then mind wandering should be doing something good for us. Nope. As it turns out, people are less happy when they're mind wandering no matter what they're doing. For example, people don't really like commuting to work very much. It's one of their least enjoyable activities. And yet, they are substantially happier when they're focused only on their commute than when their mind is going off to something else. It's amazing. So how could this be happening? I think part of the reason, a big part of the reason, is that when our minds wander, we often think about unpleasant things. And they are enormously less happy when they do that - our worries, our anxieties, our regrets. Forty-seven percent of the time, people are thinking about something other than what they're currently doing. Ranging from a high of 65 percent when people are taking a shower, brushing their teeth to 50 percent when they're working to 40 percent when they're exercising, all the way down to this one short bar on the right that I think some of you are probably laughing at. Ten percent of the time, people's minds are wandering when they're having sex. But there's something I think that's quite interesting in this graph, and that is, basically, with one exception, no matter what people are doing, they're mind wandering at least 30 percent of the time, which suggests I think that mind wandering isn't just frequent, it's ubiquitous. It pervades basically everything that we do. In other words, mind wandering very likely seems to be an actual cause and not merely a consequence of unhappiness. RAZ: And that's the single biggest determinant? Like, you can say, without question, the most consistent result we have is that when your mind wanders, you're less happy. KILLINGSWORTH: Exactly. I think our ability to mind wander is kind of a superpower. The ability for human beings to think about something other than what they're doing allows them to plan and reason and do a lot of really amazing things that make us, you know, such a successful species. But it's a superpower we can't really control in the sense that we use it really often for things that aren't very helpful for us. And that's one of the surprising results in my research is that when I look across all the different activities that people engage in, they are universally happier when they're fully engaged in that activity and not mind wandering no matter what they're doing. RAZ: So when they're in the moment? KILLINGSWORTH: When they're in the moment. Exactly. RAZ: How do you do that? Like, how do you get to that place? KILLINGSWORTH: That's the million-dollar question. And I don't know the answer. I think it is possible for people to redirect their attention. One thing I've certainly started doing since I've begun this research is notice where my attention is. And when I do find it straying, especially if I'm mind wandering about something that's not really productive or useful or adding to my experience, to just bring my attention back to whatever I'm doing and to do that repeatedly. And when I do that, I can not only sort of turn off mind wandering, but I think really enjoy that experience a lot more. RAZ: I mean, do you think that's, like, science - like, what you're researching could ultimately give us a formula to find happiness? KILLINGSWORTH: I think it can make a lot of progress. This is a question that people have been thinking about for thousands of years. And there are some recurring answers like treating other people like you would like to be treated. But at the same time, I think there are just a lot of debates that haven't really been resolved. And it's really hard to resolve them when it's just people talking at each other. And I think that is really the power of science is to use the scientific method and collect data and figure our who's right. You know, in the same way that we've stood on the shoulders of our ancestors to understand a lot about medicine or the economy, I think we're at the start of a long but I think really exciting journey to understand a lot more about the causes of happiness.

DAN GILBERT: Right now, I'm sitting in a very small room on the Harvard University campus filled with electronica. RAZ: This is Harvard psychologist Dan Gilbert again, and we brought him into that small studio to ask him about his life's work. GILBERT: What really brings happiness about has become a question that we have put in the hands of poets and philosophers for millennia, and then recently we've asked scientists to answer questions about what brings human happiness. RAZ: So, like, you study the Super Bowl of scientific subjects. GILBERT: Of course. Why would I write a book about something that wasn't the single most important topic in the world? RAZ: Here's the open from Dan's TED Talk. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)GILBERT: When you have 21 minutes to speak, 2 million years seems like a really long time. But evolutionarily, 2 million years is nothing. And yet in 2 million years, the human brain has nearly tripled in mass, going from the one-and-a-quarter-pound brain of our ancestor here, habilis, to the almost 3-pound meatloaf that everybody here has between their ears. And one of the main reasons that our brain got so big is because it got a new part called the prefrontal cortex. Now what does a prefrontal cortex do for you that should justify the entire architectural overhaul of the human skull in the blink of evolutionary time? Well, turns out the prefrontal cortex does lots of things, but one of the most important things it does is it is an experience simulator. Human beings have this marvelous adaptation that they can actually have experiences in their heads before they try them out in real life. This is a trick that got our species out of the trees and into the shopping mall. Now all of you have done this. I mean, you know, Ben and Jerry's doesn't have liver and onion ice cream, and it's not because they whipped some up, tried it and went yuck. It's because from - without leaving your armchair, you can simulate that flavor and say, yuck, before you make it. Research that my laboratory has been doing, that economists and psychologists around the country have been doing, have revealed something really quite startling to us, something we call the impact bias, which is the tendency for the simulator to work badly, for the simulator to make you believe that different outcomes are more different than in fact they really are. From field studies to laboratory studies, we see that winning or losing an election, gaining or losing a romantic partner, getting or not getting a promotion, passing or not passing a college test, on and on, have far less impact, less intensity and much less duration than people expect them to have. In fact, a recent study showing how major life traumas affect people suggests that if it happened over three months ago, with only a few exceptions, it has no impact whatsoever on your happiness. RAZ: So I'm, like, totally surprised that this idea that, like, just three months after some kind of traumatic experience, with just few exceptions, it has no impact on happiness. I mean, I cannot imagine somebody, you know, like, ever finding real happiness again after that. GILBERT: That's because your imagination, like mine, like everyone else's, is extraordinarily limited. It's not because people don't get over these events, and if by get over, we mean end up having happy productive lives. They do. In fact, the vast majority of people who experience any kind of tragedy or trauma will ultimately return to their baseline or very close to their baseline in what seems like relatively short order. We don't recognize that we are as resilient a species as we turn out to be. What's interesting to me as a psychologist is, why don't we know this about ourselves? RAZ: Yeah. GILBERT: Why is this remarkable talent hidden from our view? Why are we all surprised when people who lose a child or lose a job or lose their vision, a year or two later, are doing pretty darn well? RAZ: Yeah. Yeah. I mean, yes. Right. Why? Like. . . GILBERT: Well, I think there might be two reasons. First, the processes that enable us to be resilient and recover are often invisible. There are things our minds are doing behind the scenes. And because we don't see our minds doing them, we don't know that we're capable of it. The other possibility that philosophers and psychologists bandy about is that it's important that we not know this about ourselves. Just imagine if you knew that losing your marriage or losing your job would eventually be OK. Would you take precautions to not let any of those things happen? Maybe we are built to be strangers to ourselves so that we do the very things that evolution would have us do. RAZ: But how did we get that way? Stay with us. More on the science of happiness with Dan Gilbert in a moment. I'm Guy Raz, and you're listening to the TED Radio Hour from NPR. RAZ: It's the TED Radio Hour from NPR. I'm Guy Raz. So Dan Gilbert, as we just heard, studies happiness. And his big idea about it - an idea that's surprisingly simple - is that we are all actually hardwired to more or less be happy. And why is that? Here's more of Dan from the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)GILBERT: Because happiness can be synthesized. Sir Thomas Browne wrote in 1642, I am the happiest man alive. I have that in me that can convert poverty to riches, adversity to prosperity. I am more invulnerable than Achilles. Fortune hath not one place to hit me. What kind of remarkable machinery does this have in his head? Well, it turns out it's precisely the same remarkable machinery that all of us have. Human beings have something that we might think of as a psychological immune system, a system of cognitive processes - largely non-conscious cognitive processes - that help them change their views of the world so that they can feel better about the worlds in which they find themselves. Like Sir Thomas, you have this machine. Unlike Sir Thomas, you seem not to know it. RAZ: Yeah. I mean, we really don't. If happiness can be synthesized, I mean, is it real? Like, is it real happiness? GILBERT: Well, it's real. Synthetic doesn't mean not real. It means it was synthesized. The word synthetic describes the origin of something. So synthetic nylon is nylon. It's not an imaginary stocking. It's just manufactured in a laboratory. Similarly, real and synthetic are not kinds of happiness. They're sources of happiness. They tell us whether a person's happiness was generated by the events that happened to them or by their reframing of those events. Both of these are legitimate ways to achieve happiness. And the kind of happiness we achieve, as far as psychologists can tell, isn't qualitatively different. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)GILBERT: We synthesize happiness, but we think happiness is a thing to be found. Now you don't need me to tell you too many examples of people synthesizing happiness, I suspect. Though, I'm going to show you some experimental evidence as a challenge to myself, since I say this once in a while in lectures. I took a copy of the New York Times and tried to find some instances of people synthesizing happiness. And here are three guys synthesizing happiness. The first one is Jim Wright. Some of you are old enough to remember he was the chairman of the House of Representatives, and he resigned in disgrace when this young Republican named Newt Gingrich found out about a shady book deal he had done. He lost everything. He lost his money. He lost his power. What does have to say all these years later about it? I am so much better off physically, financially, mentally and almost every other way. What other way would there be to be better off? Vegetabley? Minerally? Animally? He's pretty much covered them there. Moreese Bickham is somebody you've never heard of. Moreese Bickham uttered these words upon being released. He was 78 years old. He'd spent 37 years in Louisiana State Penitentiary for a crime he didn't commit. He was ultimately exonerated at the age of 78 through DNA evidence. And what did he have to say about his experience? I don't have one minute's regret. I was a glorious experience. Glorious? This guy is not saying, well, you know, there were some nice guys, they had a gym. It's glorious, a word we usually reserve for something like a religious experience. Oh, and then finally, you know, the best of all possible worlds. Some of you recognize this young photo of Pete Best, who was the original drummer for The Beatles, until they, you know, kind of, like, sent him out on an errand and snuck away and picked up Ringo on a tour. Well, in 1994, when Pete Best was interviewed - yes, he's still drummer. Yes he's a studio musician. He had this to say, I'm happier than I would've been with The Beatles. OK. There's something important to be learned from these people, and it is the secret of happiness. Here it is, finally, to be revealed. First, accrue wealth, power and prestige, then lose it. Second, spend as much of your life in prison as you possibly can. And finally, never ever join The Beatles. RAZ: I still can't believe that Pete Best is really happier that he didn't join The Beatles. But I guess I have to believe him. GILBERT: Well, not only should we trust him when he says he's happier that he didn't join The Beatles, we should really trust him when he says he's happy. And I suspect that if we could compare his happiness to the happiness that Ringo Starr experiences or Paul McCartney experiences, we wouldn't find many differences. RAZ: But what is it about these people that you mentioned? Like, what is their secret? GILBERT: Some people are more capable of doing this work than others. All of us are capable of it sometimes and not capable of it at other times. But the point is the amount of happiness or unhappiness we feel is in part in our hands. The in part part of that sentence is remarkably important. It is wrong to say that we have no control over our happiness. It is wrong to say that we have complete control over our happiness. We have some input into how happy we will be. And it has to do with how we frame events. We can learn to see events in a constructive and positive way. RAZ: To what extent do things like marriage or falling in love or getting a promotion or - to what extent do those things have an impact on how happy we're going to be? GILBERT: They have an extremely large impact for an extremely brief amount of time. When you think of something like winning the lottery or falling in love or something bad like losing your eyesight or getting fired from your job, you're probably imagining the early moments of those episodes. Well, indeed, the day you get fired from your job or the day you'd meet the girl of your dreams are very special days. What it turns out to be the case is that the happiness that these events induce doesn't last that long. RAZ: I mean, how? What explains that? GILBERT: Well, a number of things explain it. One of them is just the nature of emotion. Happiness is an emotion. It's a feeling, and the human brain isn't built to sustain a single feeling over the long-term. Look, think of it this way. Your emotions are a compass. They're telling you which direction to go in. When you feel bad, you turn left. You try something different in your life. When you feel good, you keep on marching in the direction you're going. That's what emotions are for. Now what good would a compass be if it were perpetually stuck on north? It turns out that human beings need their emotions to both be elicited, but then to come back to baseline. And happiness is one of the emotions that does exactly that. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)GILBERT: The bard said everything best of course, and he's making my point here. But he's making it hyperbolically.  'Tis nothing good or bad, but thinking makes it so. It's nice poetry, but that can't exactly be right. Is there really nothing good or bad? Is it really the case that gallbladder surgery and a trip to Paris are just the same thing? No, that seems like a one-question IQ test. They can't be exactly the same. In other words, yes, some things are better than others. We should have preferences that lead us into one future over another. But when those preferences drive us too hard and too fast because we have overrated the difference between these futures, we are at risk. The lesson I want to leave you with from these data is that our longings and our worries are both to some degree overblown because we have within us the capacity to manufacture the very commodity we are constantly chasing when we choose experience. Thank you. (APPLAUSE)RAZ: So I guess you're right. I mean, there really is no secret to happiness. GILBERT: There is no secret. It takes work, and it isn't hard work. But it's work that you have to put in religiously over time. Somebody who spends a few minutes a day playing with their children and really being present, that's not going to make you instantly happy the day you do it. But over months and years of practice, this will change your life. RAZ: Are those some of the things that you do? GILBERT: Yes, I do some of these things myself. For example, every day as I walk to work, I remind myself how grateful I am that I'm walking. A few years ago, I couldn't walk because I had a back injury that really took me out of circulation. And not a day goes by now when I put one foot in front of the other, I think, walking, this is a really good. RAZ: Psychologist Dan Gilbert.

When you think of something like winning the lottery or falling in love or something bad like losing your eyesight or getting fired from your job, you're probably imagining the early moments of those episodes. Well, indeed, the day you get fired from your job or the day you'd meet the girl of your dreams are very special days. What it turns out to be the case is that the happiness that these events induce doesn't last that long. RAZ: I mean, how? What explains that? GILBERT: Well, a number of things explain it. One of them is just the nature of emotion. Happiness is an emotion. It's a feeling, and the human brain isn't built to sustain a single feeling over the long-term. Look, think of it this way. Your emotions are a compass. They're telling you which direction to go in. When you feel bad, you turn left. You try something different in your life. When you feel good, you keep on marching in the direction you're going. That's what emotions are for. Now what good would a compass be if it were perpetually stuck on north? It turns out that human beings need their emotions to both be elicited, but then to come back to baseline. And happiness is one of the emotions that does exactly that. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) GILBERT: The bard said everything best of course, and he's making my point here. But he's making it hyperbolically.  'Tis nothing good or bad, but thinking makes it so. It's nice poetry, but that can't exactly be right. Is there really nothing good or bad? Is it really the case that gallbladder surgery and a trip to Paris are just the same thing? No, that seems like a one-question IQ test. They can't be exactly the same. In other words, yes, some things are better than others. We should have preferences that lead us into one future over another. But when those preferences drive us too hard and too fast because we have overrated the difference between these futures, we are at risk. The lesson I want to leave you with from these data is that our longings and our worries are both to some degree overblown because we have within us the capacity to manufacture the very commodity we are constantly chasing when we choose experience. Thank you. (APPLAUSE) RAZ: So I guess you're right. I mean, there really is no secret to happiness. GILBERT: There is no secret. It takes work, and it isn't hard work. But it's work that you have to put in religiously over time. Somebody who spends a few minutes a day playing with their children and really being present, that's not going to make you instantly happy the day you do it. But over months and years of practice, this will change your life. RAZ: Are those some of the things that you do? GILBERT: Yes, I do some of these things myself. For example, every day as I walk to work, I remind myself how grateful I am that I'm walking. A few years ago, I couldn't walk because I had a back injury that really took me out of circulation. And not a day goes by now when I put one foot in front of the other, I think, walking, this is a really good. RAZ: Psychologist Dan Gilbert.

But when Antonio Zadra, professor at the University of Montreal, began working on a study about nightmares he found that the narrative animating those bad dreams tended to be very different between men and women. He is coauthor of a new study that has a lot to say about the differences in the way we dream. He joins us now from Montreal. Welcome to the program. ANTONIO ZADRA: Thank you for having me. MARTIN: So, what were the differences you noticed in the nightmare scenarios of men and women? ZADRA: Well, there are some themes that appear more in men's nightmares. These include themes of disasters, calamities - for example, dreamings of floods, earthquakes, wars, as well as infestations, for instance, of insects. Whereas when we look at themes involving interpersonal conflicts, be it with friends, family members, they're twice as often found in women's nightmares than in men's nightmares. MARTIN: Did this come as a surprise to you? Did you expect to find dreams varied so much by gender? ZADRA: I think one of the biggest surprises wasn't just some of these differences we found between the nightmares of men and women, but the broad range of themes people reported, the image most people have of nightmares, of being dreams of chase and pursuit and physical aggression, certainly occurs in the majority of nightmares. There's really a wide range, including themes related to interpersonal conflicts, for instance, themes related to health; being told that not only do you have cancer but you're going to be dead within three days. Here, the nightmares are not driven by emotions such as fear but usually extreme sadness, for instance. MARTIN: This is a pretty comprehensive study, but you also noted that women in general have better dream recall. ZADRA: Absolutely. Not only do women have a much better facility to recall their dreams, they are generally much more interested in their dreams than are men, much more willing to take part in studies on dreams. They're just more interested by the topic. MARTIN: So, what do you think we can take away from this study? ZADRA: A lot of things. One, you have these gender differences that you can relate to broad conceptualizations of how people experience their waking life activities. And you can even draw up parallels with entertainment industry, in the sense that if you look at who tends to go to pure action movies and who wants to spend their time being entertained by that, it is generally men. MARTIN: But did I hear you say that men are more likely to dream scenarios where they're the only good guy, they're the superhero of their own dream? ZADRA: Or at least they are trying to be or they are placed in that position. Now, they may or may not succeed in whatever challenges they face in their dreams or nightmares. But, yes, they are more often alone, at least in their nightmares. MARTIN: Very interesting. Professor Antonio Zadra of the University of Montreal sharing his gender dream research.

I'm Robert Siegel. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: And I'm Audie Cornish. Next week, the state of Missouri plans to execute Michael Taylor. He was convicted of raping and killing a 15-year-old girl. But the state does not yet know how it will kill Taylor. And other states face the same problem, a nationwide shortage of the drugs commonly used in lethal injections. As a result, some states have resorted to improvised and untested cocktails of drugs that have led to clearly painful executions and a flurry of lawsuits from death row inmates. We're going to focus now on the reasons for the shortage with Associated Press reporter Juergen Baetz. He joins us from Brussels. Welcome to the program. JUERGEN BAETZ: Hi. I'm glad to join you. CORNISH: Now, first, we should clarify, what are the drugs that states have been trying to get their hands on? BAETZ: The usual execution mixture, the lethal injection usually consists of three drugs. And there's one drug, sodium thiopental, which they've had a hard time getting their hands on basically since 2010. There are other drugs that are also harder to get by the day in the U. S. , but this one is really key. And they've tried to replace it. But as soon as they come up with an idea to replace it, the European Union or the companies involved act so that other drug then becomes unavailable too. CORNISH: So let's go back a little bit for a context. Back in 2010, that's when Hospira, that was the one U. S. company that was still making sodium thiopental, which is one of these drugs use for lethal injections, they decided to stop. What can you tell us about this company and why they wanted out of this particular corner of the drug business? BAETZ: Well, so this pharmaceutical company, they were overhauling their plan. They were never happy with seeing the drug used for executions, which is the case for most pharmaceutical companies. They're in the health business and being part of what, at the end, serves to kill people is never good publicity for them. So that was also the case for Hospira. So they stopped production of this particular drug in California. And they were planning to move the production to Italy, but Italy is part of the European Union, which is fiercely hostile to the death penalty. And so the Italian authorities there demanded this U. S. company that they must guarantee the drug would never be used in executions in the United States or elsewhere. And the drug manufacturer had to admit it couldn't provide that guarantee and so they decided it wasn't worth it. And they never even started the production in Italy. CORNISH: So when the U. S. drugmaker Hospira got out of this business, many state prison systems turned to European drugmakers. And, of course, those companies quickly ran into roadblocks. What happened? BAETZ: So the European Union had started in 2005 to introduce export controls on anything that could be use to torture people or that could be use in executing people. So that applies to the entire world. It's just that the United States, of course, which has a very established protocols in - of drugs that have to be used, they sort of have been hit the hardest by these export controls. And it turned out to be a cat and mouse game. The U. S. state authorities asked one manufacturer, then they turned to another country. But eventually, the European Union caught up or the drug companies dropped out of the market. So in the end, the U. S. state authorities were left standing alone. CORNISH: We've talked here about the U. S. and Europe, but are there any other markets that are open to manufacturing these drugs, another source, say, in China or India? BAETZ: Well, there is, of course, that the U. S. has pretty high standards when it comes to the import of drugs. The Food and Drug Administration has, I think, a good reputation for being pretty strict. So you can't just ask a lab in, say, China or India to produce the same things. Then, of course, it's also an issue of patents. They - maybe they're just not allowed to produce that same drug. And finally, pharmaceutical companies don't want to be involved in the death penalty. Even if they're not opposed to it, it's bad publicity for them. And they have, financially speaking, almost nothing to gain. There was one incident where an Indian company was, in fact, asked to provide one of the drugs. And as soon as they got wind that someone was buying it to resell it to U. S. correction authorities, they immediately halted those sales and cut all contacts with that person reselling it. And they said they don't want to be involved in the death penalty.

Here's NPR's social science correspondent Shankar Vedantam on why we name winter storms and how those names might affect us. SHANKAR VEDANTAM, BYLINE: We've been naming hurricanes for many years. (SOUNDBITE OF NEWS CLIP)VEDANTAM: Now The Weather Channel is doing it with winter storms. (SOUNDBITE OF THE WEATHER CHANNEL CLIP)VEDANTAM: At the University of Chicago, psychologist Nicholas Epley has noticed a pattern. We tend to name some weather systems but not others. NICHOLAS EPLEY: Notice that long stretches of beautiful sunny weather don't get names. VEDANTAM: Now, you probably think the idea of naming beautiful spring days is silly - and it is. But there's some very interesting psychology behind why we don't name spring days, and do name destructive storms. Epley explains that psychology in a new book called \"Mindwise,\" which is about how humans read the minds of others. Most of the time, this is a very useful skill. When you talk to a friend, you try and read her mind to gauge her mood, to anticipate how she'll react to what you're saying. The funny thing is we are so adept at mind-reading we regularly try and read the minds of things that don't have minds at all. EPLEY: Once this mind reading system - once this sixth sense that we have about others is triggered, then we can sometimes see minds almost everywhere we look. VEDANTAM: Epley says one sign that we are mind-reading inanimate objects is when we give those objects a name. EPLEY: Computers, our cell phones assistants. . . SIRI: How can I help you? EPLEY: . . . our cars. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED AUDIO)EPLEY: . . . our GPS phone lady in the car. . . SIRI: Service road in 0. 5 miles. EPLEY: Those are the main ones that come to mind. VEDANTAM: When we give objects a name we interact with them as if they had human properties. People talk to their GPS systems. They have personal relationships with their car. Epley says the mind-reading system is especially likely to be activated in certain circumstances. EPLEY: When something behaves unexpectedly, it's not obvious why this person or that thing behaved as it did, that's when a mind is needed. VEDANTAM: Unexpected, dangerous events are powerful triggers for our mind-reading system to kick into gear. When we see a mind behind an unexpected event, it appears to have what psychologists call intentionality. Our brains start to ask, why did this happen? What we can do to prevent this from happening again? EPLEY: Major weather events have two attributes to them that are particularly likely to make them seem somewhat mindful. VEDANTAM: One, they're dangerous. (SOUNDBITE OF THE WEATHER CHANNEL CLIP)VEDANTAM: And second, they are unexpected. (SOUNDBITE OF THE WEATHER CHANNEL CLIP)VEDANTAM: When we give a storm a name, it becomes a little more humanlike. This explains why, long before The Weather Channel started naming winter storms, humans have given names to destructive natural forces. There are Greek gods for thunder and lightning, but no Greek gods for wispy clouds on clear summer days. EPLEY: But it's possible that when you give a storm a name, you give it a persona. That makes it more likely to see it as mindful. VEDANTAM: It's not clear what the effect of naming storms has on us. Epley says the psychology of why we name storms is better understood than the psychology of what happens when we name storms. There's a potential downside. EPLEY: The Weather Channel is more than happy to drum up fear and concern for winter storm Janus or Hugo or Humberto or which ever one is coming on us next.

I'm Terry Gross. This interview is going to start with a bang - in fact, a gunshot. But don't worry, the gun is just to demonstrate an acoustic phenomenon. My guest, Trevor Cox, is an acoustic engineer. He's developed new ways of improving the sound in theaters and recording studios. He's also studied what he describes as the sonic wonders of the world, like whispering arches and singing sand dunes. His sonic travels have taken him many places including the North Sea, where he recorded the sound of bottlenose dolphins underwater; and down into a revolting Victorian era sewer, where he discovered a curving sound effect he'd not heard before. Cox is a professor of acoustic engineering at the University of Salford in Manchester, England, and the author of the book \"The Sound Book: The Science of the Sonic Wonders of the World. \" He's brought a few recording of sounds few people have ever heard. Trevor Cox, welcome to FRESH AIR. TREVOR COX: Thanks. GROSS: So let's start with a sound of a gunshot. Now, this is a gunshot that you recorded in what's called an anechoic chamber, a chamber with no echo. I want you to describe what this chamber is. COX: Well, you walk into this chamber through some really large steel doors, and the first thing that kind of strikes you is you stood on a trampoline floor of wire because all around you on the floor, on the walls and the ceiling, there are these strange, gray foam wedges. And they're there to completely absorb any reflection. So when you hear the gunshot, all you hear is the shot coming straight from the gun to you, or in this case the microphone, and there's no effect of a room at all. GROSS: So I'm going to play what a gun sounds like fired in a room with absolutely no echo. And I must say it's going to be a pretty unimpressive sound. Here it is. (SOUNDBITE OF GUNSHOT)GROSS: Well, that really was mighty unimpressive. My finger snap. . . (SOUNDBITE OF FINGER SNAP)GROSS: . . . is more impressive than that in our studio, which is relatively - you know, it's meant to be a soundproof studio. Why does it sound - you know what? Let's play it one more time. (SOUNDBITE OF GUNSHOT)COX: You see, I think you assume that's unimpressive but actually, I'm really impressed by it because you think of how you normally hear a gun, especially when Hollywood has had their hands on it, how impressive everything sounds and how it booms in the room. And as you said, when you click your finger, you get this booming sound. A lot of that is what the room is doing. We don't normally hear sounds without the effect of a room. We normally have walls around us reflecting sound. So it's kind of - it takes you back. I was quite - you know, when I first recorded that, I thought, did I get the recording right, did I fire the gun. . . (LAUGHTER)COX: Because it's just like a click. GROSS: OK, so let's do the opposite. You also fired a gun in a room designed to have a lot of reverb. Describe that room for us. COX: Well, this is quite an incredible place. It's actually an old oil tank. It was buried in the side of the Scottish hills back at the start of the second world war to protect all the shipping oil from the German bombing. And so it's a vast space. It's kind of a size of a cathedral. And it's just built out of this vast concrete arch. And yeah, we fired a starting pistol in there, exactly the same one you just hear in the anechoic chamber, to measure the acoustic. GROSS: OK, let's hear that one. (SOUNDBITE OF GUNSHOT)GROSS: Wow, it's still echoing. Gee. You know, you know what? It sounds like this really loud gun turning into a plane going by. COX: Yeah, it's quite incredible when you're in there as well, because you actually, you can feel the sound wash over you. GROSS: It's still echoing. I still hear it in the background. It's still going. COX: It is still going. When I was doing the recording, of course I was staying completely silent to get all the recording, and I just was watching the digital meter counting up time, and the recording you've got there, it's over a minute long before it died away. And funny enough, it was still dying away when I turned it off. But it was below the threshold of hearing. It was below what I could hear anymore at low frequency, but it was still going when I stopped. GROSS: So let me just ask you if, if you're in this like huge metal tank, basically, how do you prevent the gun from ricocheting - the bullet from ricocheting? COX: Oh, well, that was a starting pistol. So it was firing blanks. So it was. . . GROSS: Oh, of course, right. COX: It's quite a standard method of measuring concert halls, actually. We would do it in a normal sort of classical concert hall to measure the acoustics. And it's a really quick and easy way. I mean this tank, which is, as I said, in the middle of nowhere in Scotland, right at the top of Scotland, is also got no power in it. It's no lighting. It's got no electricity. So you have to be able to measure it with anything - something really easy. So there's no power for a loudspeaker, for example. So we used a gun to excite the space as a way of measuring. But we also had a limitation as well, because the only way into is down the oil pipes themselves. There are no doors into this place. So you placed in a horizontal pipe and shoved through a pipe, which isn't much bigger than you are, to actually get into this oil tank. (LAUGHTER)GROSS: You know, I don't really think of acoustic engineers as doing this kind of thing. But you're just obsessed with sound. COX: Yeah, I mean actually my whole adventure kind of started in a sewer of all places. And I would not recommend going into a sewer. But I was asked to do an interview on the acoustic of a sewer, and I thought, well, I've never been in one. I'll go and see what it's like. And it was as revolting as you can imagine. But it had this most amazing acoustic effect. It was a cylindrical sewer, an old Victorian brick storm drain, and actually the sound would cling to the inside of the brickwork and spiral around and around in circles, and it was quite amazing. GROSS: So what did you learn acoustically from that smelly and disgusting but audio fascinating trip? COX: Well, I think the first thing I took from that was actually some amazing acoustics can be in the most unlikely of places. And some of the other places I went to, like the oil tank, are not immediately on your list of places to go to if you're thinking of acoustics, or nice places for that matter. But the other thing is that spiraling effect, what I realized was that's the kind of same effect as you get in whispering galleries. There's a variety of them around the world. In England the most famous one's St. Paul's Cathedral in London, where you go up into the base of the dome of St. Paul's Cathedral, and you whisper into the wall, and the sound skims around the inside of the dome to be heard by your friend, who's way, way across on the other side. And it sounds like the sound is emerging from the walls. And you have a conversation a hundred feet apart from each other. GROSS: So let's get back to those two different spaces that we heard the gun, the starting pistol, fired in. The first was a room specially designed to have no echo at all, and the second was this huge oil drum that is incredibly reverberating, lots and lots of echo. And we heard the difference of how a starting gun sounds fired in each. What's the moral of that story in terms of the kind of acoustics that you actually make your living doing, which is designing acoustics for theaters and concert halls? COX: Yeah, I mean those two examples are just interesting extremes. I mean, that oil tank is now the world record holder for its reverberation. And the anechoic chamber is the complete opposite. But actually when you design a room, you would never go to those two extremes because it's just not necessary, and it's also not very good. So if I wanted to design a place for music, let's say classical music, then I want a bit of reverberation because it makes music sound nicer. I mean it's a standard kind of thing that people even making pop music do is when they hear vocals, they put reverb on it just to make the sound blend a bit better. You know, when we go into a shower, we sing because we sound a little better with a little bit of that sort of blur going on. But you don't want too much. So that oil tank is too much because if you really reverb, then what happens is you get a mush, all the words and all the music just run into each other. So normally you would never have anything as reverberant as that oil tank or as dry as the anechoic chamber. GROSS: So when you're designing a concert hall that's going to hold symphony orchestras and also rock concerts, how do you design something that's going to be suitable for both? COX: Well, there's a few key things that we know are really important for a - let's say classic music to start with. We know that we want this reverberance, this sort of kind of sense that sound lingers a bit after the orchestra finishes, for a couple seconds is typically a design criteria. And to do that, concert halls are really very large, so normally if you sit in a concert hall and look up, you'll see it's a huge volume. It's really high ceiling. That's to give you that reverberance. But also we want to get rid of things which deaden the sound. You know, soft stuff like curtaining and carpets are all bad news. So actually if you look around a concert hall, all the walls and the ceiling are really hard materials. There's a sort of kind of myth around that the concert halls are made of wood so that the wood vibrates. But actually if you were to take the wood off, you'd find actually it's glued to concrete behind. There's no way that wood is vibrating at all. And a third sort of kind of key criteria would be also to make sure we get lots of sound from the sides because when we're outdoors - have you ever heard one of those concerts when they play outdoors? It all sounds like a bit remote, like the people are playing on the stage from a distance. In a concert hall you're kind of surrounded by sound. That sort of sense of envelopment is created by sound coming from the side, which is why halls, you know, something like Boston Symphony Hall is narrow and tall. It wasn't - we didn't know that when it was designed back in its day, but we now know why it works, is because it creates lots of sound from the side. GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is Trevor Cox. He's an acoustic engineer and the author of the new book \"The Sound Book: The Science of the Sonic Wonders of the World. \" Let's take a short break; then we'll talk some more. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is acoustic engineer Trevor Cox. He is a professor of acoustic engineering at the University of Salford in England. He's the author of the new book \"The Sound Book: The Science of the Sonic Wonders of the World. \"So we've been talking about the acoustics in concert halls and theaters. You say that cathedrals have natural reverb in it. Do you think - like what makes cathedrals so great for sound, old cathedrals? COX: Well, there's a couple of things. I think, first of all, from the point of view of, you know, a place to have a religious ceremony, I think we associate it with something very spiritual. And that's just to do with the very reverberant, echoey conditions in there, because if you go in there, and you start talking too loud, it echoes around and you're suddenly embarrassed. So it's kind of that very sort of hard surface, big volume, kind of forces us to whisper and therefore treat the place with a bit of reverence. So I think the spiritual sense in a church is really kind of dictated by the sort of conditions of these old Gothic cathedrals. And we kind of seem to associate that with a sense of spirituality. GROSS: Let's go back to the anechoic chamber, and that's the soundproof chamber with, like, no echo at all that we started talking about at the beginning of the interview. And this is the one where you fired the starting pistol, and it just sounded like a little pop. So does your ear, when you're in a place that's that soundproof, does your ear or your brain try to compensate for the lack of sound and find something to hear? COX: Yeah, it's one of the surprises when you take visitors into that anechoic chamber, is that they actually hear sound even though you say we're taking you into a completely silent room. And actually the sounds that you're hearing are ones you generate yourself. So you know, you've normally got your blood pumping through your body, including in your head, and normally that's not audible. But, you know, sometimes when you exercise, you get that pounding effect. So you can hear a bit of blood pumping sometimes in the anechoic chamber. And you can also sometimes hear a high-pitched hissing sound, and that's thought to be sort of the firings in the auditory nerve. I mean essentially what happens is your brain is tweaking the inner ear to try and pick up sound. It's kind of turning the volume up, really, of the inner ear. And it turns it up so far that you start hearing a bit of the nervous system working. So, you know, you can - there's a couple of sounds you hear, and that was what inspired John Cage's famous silent work \"4 Minute 33 Seconds. \" He went to an anechoic chamber across in the States at Harvard expecting find silence and then didn't find it, and that inspired his composition. GROSS: And that composition is four minutes and 33 seconds of just silence. Like he begins the piece, nothing happens. You're listening to the ambient sound around you. And then it ends after four minutes and 30 seconds. And it's kind of like an awareness composition of just, like, being aware of the sounds around you. COX: Yeah, it's a very interesting thing to go and hear. Actually, I went and heard a performance of it. And I mean the thought of paying to hear nothing sounds a bit odd in the first instance, but actually it was quite - it was a fascinating thing. And what happens is just like a music performance. So we had a pianist playing it, and they come on and then they bow and you clap, and all the standard stuff goes on except for nothing is actually played. And what becomes apparent as you listen to it is it's really all about the noise of audience. So it's - the performance is no longer really focused on the stage; it's focused on the people around you. And at the end of the performance, there was a round of applause and a sort of few ironic encores being shouted from the audience. And funny enough, I felt a real sense of collective endeavor. And that's what you get when you listen or make music, you get a sense of collective endeavor. So even though it's a slightly strange piece, it certainly felt like a piece of music. GROSS: When you spoke, I'm sure you tried speaking in the anechoic chamber, the soundproof room, did your voice sound different than you're used to? COX: Yeah, it sounds very different, and in fact some visitors find it quite unpleasant. It's a bit like when you go up in an aircraft and your ears need to pop. It sounds a bit like that. So all the voices are a bit muffled. And if you have to talk, you find yourself straining a bit. You find yourself working a little harder as you talk. And the thing that visitors don't like about it is because you see a room. It's very clearly - there's the walls all around you. They look odd, but they're clearly there. But your ear can't ear the room. And so your senses are a bit off-kilter. Your sense of vision and sense of sound are out of kilter. And some people feel a bit queasy and ask to leave. GROSS: What's the purpose of the room? COX: Well, if you want to measure anything in acoustic engineering, then you need to be able to sort of kind of isolate the effect of objects. If I had a loudspeaker, if I stick it in a room, I measure the loudspeaker, but I also measure all the effects of the room. If I take it into an anechoic chamber, I measure just the effects of the loudspeaker. So it's a way of isolating things, and it has to be incredibly quiet because we also measure very quiet things in there. So it's - it's really it's like an isolation booth for acoustic measurement. GROSS: You know, when you're - I'm sure coming out of a room with no sound, like a totally soundproof room like the anechoic chamber, when you emerge from that, you probably realize that there's just about no such thing as silence in the actual world, that there's always ambient sound around you, even when you think there's silence. COX: Yes, I think finding silence is actually quite difficult in the modern world. And the funny thing about the anechoic chamber for me is if you go into it a lot, because you've been there a lot of times, your brain gets used to it. So it knows it's an odd room. For me, it's just like walking into any other room now. So that startling sort of effect of coming out and suddenly your ears opening up to the sounds and suddenly things are less muffled, I don't get that anymore. It's only something you can really appreciate the first time in the space. GROSS: So one of the things that you discuss in your book is the sonic wonders that are happening out of our hearing, like the sounds underwater. And as an example, you actually brought an example with you of a recording made underwater. And I'd like you to introduce this for us and tell us what we're going to be hearing. COX: Yeah, this is recorded up near the Arctic, under the Arctic ice. And it's actually bearded seals calling out to each other. And to make this measurement, you need a hydrophone. I'm very lucky that Cornell University gave me a copy of this because this is one I haven't got to hear myself yet. GROSS: You mention a hydrophone. This is like a microphone under water? COX: Yeah, it's a microphone which works underwater. I mean, our hearing doesn't work very well under water. If you go swimming, you know that. And similarly, normal microphones don't work very well underwater, and you need special microphones designed to work in water. I mean aquatic animals use sound all the time because light doesn't travel very well in water. It soon disperses. It's hard to see what's going on. But sound can travel huge distances. And that's one of the things these bearded seals are doing, is they can communicate over huge distances with these low-frequency, sort of weird glissandos. GROSS: OK, so let's listen, and then you can tell us more about it. (SOUNDBITE OF SEALS)GROSS: I have to say that's the kind of sound you'd expect to hear in a science fiction movie. COX: Yeah, I mean it sounds like UFOs landing or something, doesn't it? I mean, there are some animals which make the most strange sounds. GROSS: And those were seals? COX: Yeah, they're bearded seals. And in - when you're - the males calling out to the females and quite possibly saying, you know, come over here, I'm the best male to mate with. And the thing is, the male's attracting the female by doing a song. And so what it does is it tries to show its vocal athleticism to show it's really particularly fit to be mated with. And I guess one of the things they might do is over time extend their glissandos longer and longer and longer because it's more and more impressive to the female. And it's common in animals. You know, you have these most strange sort of calls. But a sort of, kind of - it's a way of attracting the female or defending their territory. GROSS: So it's just amazing to think about all the sounds in the world that the human ear doesn't hear because either it's out of, you know, we're not underwater listening, or because it's out of the range of our hearing. But let me ask you. I don't know if you know the answer to this, but if you were - if you somehow managed to dive underwater in Alaska, where these seals are, where it's probably way too cold to dive, would you be hearing those glissandos? COX: Well, your ear is not particularly sensitive because it's not designed to sort of have waterways lapping against our eardrum and working. It's designed to have air pushing against our eardrum. So we certainly can hear something when we're underwater because of course if you go, I don't know, go into the swimming pool, you'll hear the radio on a side being sort of kind of still picked up. But it is quite muffled. So I would think that you probably could hear something, but it wouldn't be as impressive as if you picked it up on a hydrophone. GROSS: Right, so a hydrophone is designed to hear the things that the human ear wouldn't hear underwater. COX: Yeah, I mean a very common tool, if you're, say, the military wanting to sort of listen out for what's around, or if you're a fisherman wanting to send sonar signals out to try and find fish, or if you're, you know, oil exploration, and you wanted to kind of do seismology kind of testing, you need things in the water to pick up sound, and that's what the hydrophone is for. GROSS: Trevor Cox will be back in the second half of the show. His new book is called \"The Sound Book: The Science of the Sonic Wonders of the World. \" I'm Terry Gross and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross back with Trevor Cox, author of \"The Sound Book: The Science of the Sonic Wonders of the World. \"  He's an acoustic engineer who's designed sound for theaters and concert halls. He's also traveled extensively, documenting sonic wonders. When we left off, we were talking about a recording of bearded seals near Point Barrow, Alaska calling out to each other under water. The seals were recorded with a special microphone designed for underwater use called a hydrophone. Well, another recording you brought with you is of tadpoles munching on a hydrophone. Why would they be doing that? COX: Yeah. This was - I met an artist called Lee Patterson who's local to me in Manchester, and he likes to go and record in little sort of fishing lakes, not very big places, and pick up the sounds of tiny animals. So things like, you know, like water boatman or pond skaters, you know, they make - sort of sound a bit like crickets. But he - when he - when I met up with him, there were loads of tadpoles. It was in spring. And if you drop a hydrophone into them, the tadpoles will come along and try and eat it. And so what you hear is the sound of the sort of scraping of the tadpoles - they don't really have teeth but their sort of mouth parts - on the hydrophone. And it's a bit disconcerting because he handed me a pair of headphones to put on to listen to it because we were by the lake, and it really did sound like someone was scraping right at my ear. So it was a bit disconcerting. GROSS: Well, let's hear how disconcerting it is. This is tadpoles munching on a hydrophone. (SOUNDBITE OF TADPOLES MUNCHING ON A HYDROPHONE)GROSS: That is so odd. (LAUGHTER)GROSS: Right, it is. And when you consider how tiny - I don't know how amplified that is, but when you consider how tiny tadpoles are, that they'd be making that kind of munching sound? COX: Yeah. You have - it is - it's highly amplified, actually. And yeah, he's - because he's perfected his techniques for picking up these tiny little sounds. So yeah, you have to work quite hard to get that. But it is quite an amazing sound. And the world is full of these natural sounds. We think of natural sounds. We think of things like birds songs, but there's a whole variety of kind of crazy sort of animal sounds that you can pick up if you look out for them. GROSS: How does sound travel underwater? COX: Well, much more efficiently than it does in air. I mean, it's the same kind of process in the fact that you've got a wave, and in air, it's being passed from air molecule to air molecule whereas in underwater, it's being passed from water molecule to water molecule. And it just happens to be that in water it goes further, which is another reason why aquatic animals like to use it because it can travel huge, great distances underwater in a way that it never would do in the air. It would die away much quicker. GROSS: Let's talk about one of the sonic wonders of the world, which is a really familiar sound, and that's just like thunder. As an acoustic engineer, tell us your version of what's happening with loud thunder. COX: What's amazing with thunder is when you hear it, I mean, it's actually got that crack, and then it's got the rumble afterwards. As a kid, when you drew thunderstorms, you would've drawn the lightning with that jagged line. If you didn't have that jagged line, you wouldn't have the rumble of the thunder. So it's quite interesting how, you know, just something - a visual look of lightning is really crucial to how the thunder sounds. So when you draw a jagged line like that, each little kink is actually generating the sound. And the reason that a thunder rumbles is because the sound takes different time to come from different kinks because they're all slightly different distances from you. And that's the reason you get that very distinctive rumble sound. GROSS: Oh. I always figured the rumbling was because it was like echoing all around, you know, the buildings or the woods or wherever you were. COX: Well, I mean, in woods you will get echoing. But no, this is - the rumble is due to the fact that the sound is made all away along the lightning strike, all away along the sort of bright light because it's - I mean, it's basically created when the air is suddenly heated up. You get all these shockwaves generating. But because that strike, you know, those long, you know, bright light is all different distances from you, some of it arrives quickly from you because it's near you, and some of it arrives slower because it's further away. So you get this sort of extended sound. If you've ever been near when the lightning strike, you don't hear the rumble. You just hear their loud crack, really, and that rumble really - only really is more obvious the further away you are. GROSS: Why is wind noisy? COX: Well, wind on its own isn't particularly - it's going to hit something to make it noisy. And at Manchester at the moment, the best example of that is the Beetham Tower in the city center. So we have this tower block in the city center which howls in the wind. And we've just - as well as having a really damp January, a mild January, we've had a really, really windy winter. And only a couple of days ago, it was so loud. It was waking people up in the town center. And the wind itself was hitting - there's a structure on top of this Beetham Tower, which is a whole set of glass panes. And it was hitting those, and it was creating a whistling sound which is being amplified. So it's like some giant wind harp up here. And it creates all sorts of noise problems. GROSS: So when you say that wind doesn't make - wind isn't inherently noisy, what creates the noise? COX: What creates noise in the first place is turbulence. So if I was to pick up a beer bottle and blow across it, what you have is you got air sort of hitting the edge and creating sort of eddies. I mean, you see turbulence in the water. So if I have a smooth-running river and I put a rock in, you suddenly see that white water. That's turbulence of the water. The same thing is happening around the bottle neck. When I blow across it, you just can't see it obviously because it's sound and you can't see the air molecules moving. And then that sort of turbulence creates a sort of - kind of a vague noise. But it will lock into the resonance of the air in the main base of the bottle. And that's what actually creates a distinctive tone. And it's how flutes work. It's how - if you ever hear wind whistling past railings, that's what you get. You hear an Aeolian harp, it's created by turbulence in a slightly different way, but it's - mostly, it's created by turbulence of some form. GROSS: One of the things you've done - you have a very interesting website, and one of the things you've done is do a survey of what people find the most unpleasant noise in the world - the most unpleasant sound in the world. So what one? COX: Well, in my survey, yeah, people went online and listened to a whole variety, about 30 other sounds, and they scored them. The worst one was the sound of someone being sick, I'm afraid, which. . . GROSS: Somebody vomiting. Somebody retching. COX: Yeah. I'm afraid yeah. People not often like me mention it really, but that was came at the top. GROSS: So just curious, who did you record retching so that you could play it for people on this - for this survey on the Web? Well, I must admit it was an actress. There were - no real sick was generated in making it. It was actually just actors doing it. But it was a very good recording. It was a very good simulation. And the reason we find this unpleasant is a disgust reaction. So we have this sort of very strong aversive reaction to things that might carry something like disease. And obviously, if someone is being ill, then potentially they've got disease. And we're sort of kind of - we immediately think, oh, I must keep away from that. COX: And that's the reason it came top of the list, not only because it was just a superb recording or such a superb rendition. It was because we all universally have this sort of disgust reaction to avoid disease. Whereas you take fingernails down the blackboard, that scraping sound, which is the archetype worst sound, what we found is while some people found it really horrible, there are people who don't find it particularly unpleasant. So on average, it doesn't come top of the list. GROSS: Did you do the flip and ask what the most pleasing sound was? COX: I've always meant to do this experiment, but I've never actually done it. I mean, I think we know some of the stories. And in fact, you know, things like the warble of a bird song, you know, some really pleasant birds singing would be - probably come pretty high on lots of people's lists. But there's lots of them. I mean, my favorite would probably be thinking about to when my children were younger and they used to chatter to each other and play along with each other. And you'd just listen to their voices chatting and doing their sort of imaginary play. It was always very delightful to listen to. GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is Trevor Cox. He is an acoustic engineer and author of the new book \"The Sound Book: The Science of the Sonic Wonders of the World. \" Let's take a short break, then we'll talk some more. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is acoustic engineer Trevor Cox, author of the new book \"The Sound Book: The Science of the Sonic Wonders of the World. \" You know, earlier, we were talking about things that we don't know are making sounds underwater, and you played us the sound of seals underwater. It's also happening in the skies, things like bats with their sonar - these, you know, that they sent out to get a sense of where they are. Maybe you can explain why bats - what's happening with the bats, but I just want to say it's almost just quieting to think about all the sounds that are out there that are out of our range of hearing. We like to think of ourselves as being perceptive and really knowing what's happening in the real world, but there's all the stuff happening in the real world that we're just not capable of perceiving. COX: Yeah. It's quite interesting when you go and listen to bats. I mean, you have to take something along to listen to them. So you can buy bat detectors, which basically take the frequencies which are too high for us to hear and bring them down so you can hear them. And it's quite amazing to walk around at dusk and suddenly realize there's all these animals around that you never realized. And the thing that natural history would call - as Chris Watson made to me - that these - you think, oh, that's interesting. It's a nice click. But actually, these bats are out and hunting. So it's actually like a battle zone out there in the ultrasonic region, you know? There's frequencies we can't hear. They're actually battling to try and actually find the insects and kill them. So it's not quite as such as kind of a nice and sort of nature sort of sound as you might think. GROSS: So what is the sound that the bats emit and what is it for? COX: Well, it's a very short chirp, mostly. So it's a sound which is quite short and sweeps causing frequency very quickly. And they're listening for the reflection coming back. I mean, they're actually basically shouting, almost - you know, they work at real limits of how their vocal system and how their hearing system works, which is basically the same as ours, pretty much. So they're shouting these very short, little sort of chirps out. They bounce off objects, let's say, another insect or off a tree, then come back and by (unintelligible) what reflection is like, it can tell what it's reflected off, and also by how long it's taken, they can tell how far where the objects are. And that's how they navigate. I mean, there are people who do echolocate. As human beings, we do it. You can train yourself to do it if you wish. And there are blind people who do it. But it's a skill you have to learn. You can't just continuously pick up. GROSS: Echolocate so that you figure out where you are based on the reverberations of the sound of your clap or a voice or whatever? COX: Yeah. Most of the people who echolocate make a little click. You know, like, you would be going (makes noise) with your tongue or something like that. And then they hear the sound reflecting off the surfaces. And they can tell, you know, if they're close to a surface. That little click comes back slightly elongated so they know how far where the surface is. They listen to very subtle changes in the sound when they're looking at it. And, yes, it's amazing when you - when people do it because it's kind of a skillful thing to do and something you don't expect from a human. GROSS: What's one of the sonic wonders of the world that you find most fascinating that I have not yet asked you about? COX: It's really hard to pick a favorite - most amazing one, because there's just so many. But I must tell you, I really, you know, really enjoyed going to the Mojave Desert to hear the booming sand dunes. And I think when I first thought this idea of going to find this sort of amazing sounds in the world, half of my list was singing sands, because they had been written about for centuries. You know, Marco Polo, there's ancient Chinese writing on them, Charles Darwin wrote about them. So they're been known about for some time. But also there's a lot of scientific controversy. There's been groups arguing about what causes them, which has also interested - tweaked my scientific mind. But to go and see one is not very, you know, you can't hear this. It's not very easy because you need to find a desert. And there's no - I mean, the nearest one to England would probably be Morocco. But I hunt to be in America, so I went to southwest. There was quite a few around in the southwest. And the Kelso Dune to the Mojave Desert do it. So you climb up to this dune, which is really hard work. It's got to be really dry. It's got to be the heat of the summer. And the sand is really loose, because if it's not loose, it doesn't work. And you see, it's made when you walk across it, you got this burping sounds, you know, a bit like a badly played tuba going, even just walking across it. But the sound that people write about is the sound what you create with an avalanche. You find the right slope and you scoot down on your backside, and you'll get this rumbling sound which drone that picks up a bit like a taxiing aircraft. And actually you can feel the whole surface vibrate underneath you. It's quite an amazing effect. GROSS: So did you do that? COX: Yeah. We were - we were unlucky on day one. We got - we arrived then - we couldn't it to work. And someone had said Kelso Dunes wasn't as tuneful as it used to be. So we went back and sort of evaluated, you know, overnight, looked back at, you know, some of the papers people have written about. And so it's kind of trying to work out. And I think the mistake we made on day one is we looked at this big dune and thought, all right, let's go to the top. We'll start there. Well, actually, the best slope was about three quarters the way up. So on the second day, we found the one which was better angle to the wind. And the thing is what happens when these sand grains have to be all roughly the same size. They have to be, roughly, spherical. They have to have special varnish on them. So you see, there's a weird sifting happening of the - of the sand grains in the wind in the Mojave Desert. And so you have to find one which is quite, you know, a bit of the dune, which is at the right angle to the prevailing wind direction as well. And I think, the first day, we weren't quite at the right angle. Day two, we got it better. We found a bigger slope. And we got some beautiful drones. GROSS: So you actually have a recording of this singing sand dune. Do you want to introduce it for us? COX: Yeah. There's two recordings actually worth playing. The first one is this burping effect, as it's described. And it's just me walking up the dune. You might even hear me panting a bit because it's quite hard work. GROSS: OK. Let's go with that. (SOUNDBITE OF SINGING SAND DUNES)COX: The second sound which is the - this more famous droning sound is that me coming down on my backside and creating an avalanche. And it's quite low frequency, so you need to turn the bass up to hear it. GROSS: And is that really an avalanche or just a sound of an avalanche? COX: It's not just synchronized avalanche of all the drains. So all the drains move in one, and therefore create sort of a sound, which is very tonal. Normally, with an avalanche, it's just like a snow avalanche. Everything is just a kind of general sort of noise. But the - because the grains are all the same size, they slip past each other in synchronization. You get this amazing droning sound. GROSS: OK. Let's hear it. (SOUNDBITE OF SINGING SAND DUNE)(SOUNDBITE OF HUM)GROSS: Do you find it really weird when something makes a sound that it doesn't seem to be capable of making? Like why would sand make a sound like that? COX: Yeah. To me when I was looking for these sort of sonic wonders, one of my things was, you know, what to go and see. I could go and see lots of things. And I think the sounds which are remarkable are some of the ones which are surprising. And to me, I've been to lots of sand dunes in my time but none of them make a sound. You know, I had to work quite hard to find this place. And that's what makes it remarkable. There's only - there are about 40 documented around the world which make that particular sound. There's probably a few more to be found, but people don't tend to go into the middle of deserts to find them. So there's probably a few more but they're relatively rare. And also, it's just - you know, also it had a nice kind of sad story behind it, which was another reason why I wanted to visit. GROSS: Since you're listening so carefully for things how do you take care of your ears? COX: Very carefully when I can. So I play the saxophone and I have ear plugs with me, special musicians ones which I'll wear if I'm in a band and it's too loud. So, yeah. No, I do quite a lot of care of my hearing. Unfortunately, I have just developed tinnitus to do with a problem, not to do with noise exposure, which is very annoying. GROSS: You've developed tinnitus? COX: Yeah. I developed a ringing in the ear due to an infection in my ear which is a very annoying thing to, kind of, get as an acoustic engineer but unfortunately it's just one of those things. There's no real cure. So you just kind of put up with it. GROSS: Describe the sensation. COX: Well, it's just - it's relatively quiet, actually, so it's not too bad but ringing in the ear, for people the sounds are very different. You know, some people describe whooshing sounds, sometimes hissing, sometimes buzzing sounds. Because we don't really fully understand how they're created but it's very individual. And mine is just a sort of general high pitched tone which you can hear if I go into a very quiet space. It's not always there but it's sometimes there and it's very annoying. GROSS: And what do doctors tell you about why you're hearing that sound? COX: Well, yeah, and tinnitus is kind of - well, there are some debates about what actually creates tinnitus. And it could be the fact that we have connections back from our brain to our ear and it could be something to do with our brain generating that sound. So there's debates about whether the generation is in the inner ear or it's along the auditory nerve or it's somewhere in the brain. So that's still being debated and until we know exactly what's causing it, there's not really going to be a cure for it. So it's - unfortunately, a lot of people sort of know things about hearing loss but, actually, one of the things you get when you get hearing loss is often tinnitus and that can be very distressing. It can keep people awake. It can make it difficult for them to work. So it can be a very difficult condition to live with. Mine's mild. It's just annoying; it's not doing me any great harm. GROSS: Does the tinnitus get amplified when you're in the anechoic chamber, the totally soundproof room? COX: Yeah. Well, it certainly becomes noticeable. So I can't hear it now at the moment. There's just enough noise around here, even though I'm in a studio, that I can't hear it. So I have to be in very quiet conditions. It is very mild tinnitus. So, yeah, an anechoic chamber if I go - I mean, I have been to silent places. Like the desert was silent for times. And, actually, when I was in the desert I hadn't got the tinnitus yet. I'll have to go out to the desert. So I didn't hear it then but I would imagine in very quiet places I would hear it - out in the countryside as well. GROSS: And just one more thing. You play saxophone, so I assume you really love music. You write that music activates more of the brain than any other known stimulus. I guess maybe that's why music is just so satisfying. COX: Yes. It is a most amazing stimulus and what's curious about it in a sense you think, well, why do we make music? I suppose the obvious answer is because we like it but then why did we develop it in the first place? You know, is it just purely a pleasure thing or is there some purpose? And there's lots of debates about what, you know, why do we have this signal which can so tap into our emotions. I mean one of the suggestions is that it's kind of a bonding thing that enables us to socialize and, you know, bring us together in a group and that's really handy because, you know, we're a social animal and we succeed at being in groups. But there are other suggestions that basically it's almost like a parasitic thing. We could make it and therefore we did and it's just sort of pleasure. It's a bit like taking a drug: we don't need to do it but we decided it would be nice. GROSS: Well, Trevor Cox, thank you so much for talking with us. COX: Oh, it's been great. Thanks very much. GROSS: Trevor Cox is the author of \"The Sound Book: The Science of the Sonic Wonders of the World. \" You can hear some of the recordings of sonic wonders that he played for us on our website freshair. npr. org. Coming up, John Powers reviews a new documentary about a controversial Holocaust survivor directed by Claude Lanzmann who made the Holocaust documentary \"Shoah. \" This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) TERRY GROSS, HOST:  This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. This interview is going to start with a bang - in fact, a gunshot. But don't worry, the gun is just to demonstrate an acoustic phenomenon. My guest, Trevor Cox, is an acoustic engineer. He's developed new ways of improving the sound in theaters and recording studios. He's also studied what he describes as the sonic wonders of the world, like whispering arches and singing sand dunes. His sonic travels have taken him many places including the North Sea, where he recorded the sound of bottlenose dolphins underwater; and down into a revolting Victorian era sewer, where he discovered a curving sound effect he'd not heard before. Cox is a professor of acoustic engineering at the University of Salford in Manchester, England, and the author of the book \"The Sound Book: The Science of the Sonic Wonders of the World. \" He's brought a few recording of sounds few people have ever heard. Trevor Cox, welcome to FRESH AIR. TREVOR COX: Thanks. GROSS: So let's start with a sound of a gunshot. Now, this is a gunshot that you recorded in what's called an anechoic chamber, a chamber with no echo. I want you to describe what this chamber is. COX: Well, you walk into this chamber through some really large steel doors, and the first thing that kind of strikes you is you stood on a trampoline floor of wire because all around you on the floor, on the walls and the ceiling, there are these strange, gray foam wedges. And they're there to completely absorb any reflection. So when you hear the gunshot, all you hear is the shot coming straight from the gun to you, or in this case the microphone, and there's no effect of a room at all. GROSS: So I'm going to play what a gun sounds like fired in a room with absolutely no echo. And I must say it's going to be a pretty unimpressive sound. Here it is. (SOUNDBITE OF GUNSHOT) GROSS: Well, that really was mighty unimpressive. My finger snap. . . (SOUNDBITE OF FINGER SNAP) GROSS: . . . is more impressive than that in our studio, which is relatively - you know, it's meant to be a soundproof studio. Why does it sound - you know what? Let's play it one more time. (SOUNDBITE OF GUNSHOT) COX: You see, I think you assume that's unimpressive but actually, I'm really impressed by it because you think of how you normally hear a gun, especially when Hollywood has had their hands on it, how impressive everything sounds and how it booms in the room. And as you said, when you click your finger, you get this booming sound. A lot of that is what the room is doing. We don't normally hear sounds without the effect of a room. We normally have walls around us reflecting sound. So it's kind of - it takes you back. I was quite - you know, when I first recorded that, I thought, did I get the recording right, did I fire the gun. . . (LAUGHTER) COX: Because it's just like a click. GROSS: OK, so let's do the opposite. You also fired a gun in a room designed to have a lot of reverb. Describe that room for us. COX: Well, this is quite an incredible place. It's actually an old oil tank. It was buried in the side of the Scottish hills back at the start of the second world war to protect all the shipping oil from the German bombing. And so it's a vast space. It's kind of a size of a cathedral. And it's just built out of this vast concrete arch. And yeah, we fired a starting pistol in there, exactly the same one you just hear in the anechoic chamber, to measure the acoustic. GROSS: OK, let's hear that one. (SOUNDBITE OF GUNSHOT) GROSS: Wow, it's still echoing. Gee. You know, you know what? It sounds like this really loud gun turning into a plane going by. COX: Yeah, it's quite incredible when you're in there as well, because you actually, you can feel the sound wash over you. GROSS: It's still echoing. I still hear it in the background. It's still going. COX: It is still going. When I was doing the recording, of course I was staying completely silent to get all the recording, and I just was watching the digital meter counting up time, and the recording you've got there, it's over a minute long before it died away. And funny enough, it was still dying away when I turned it off. But it was below the threshold of hearing. It was below what I could hear anymore at low frequency, but it was still going when I stopped. GROSS: So let me just ask you if, if you're in this like huge metal tank, basically, how do you prevent the gun from ricocheting - the bullet from ricocheting? COX: Oh, well, that was a starting pistol. So it was firing blanks. So it was. . . GROSS: Oh, of course, right. COX: It's quite a standard method of measuring concert halls, actually. We would do it in a normal sort of classical concert hall to measure the acoustics. And it's a really quick and easy way. I mean this tank, which is, as I said, in the middle of nowhere in Scotland, right at the top of Scotland, is also got no power in it. It's no lighting. It's got no electricity. So you have to be able to measure it with anything - something really easy. So there's no power for a loudspeaker, for example. So we used a gun to excite the space as a way of measuring. But we also had a limitation as well, because the only way into is down the oil pipes themselves. There are no doors into this place. So you placed in a horizontal pipe and shoved through a pipe, which isn't much bigger than you are, to actually get into this oil tank. (LAUGHTER) GROSS: You know, I don't really think of acoustic engineers as doing this kind of thing. But you're just obsessed with sound. COX: Yeah, I mean actually my whole adventure kind of started in a sewer of all places. And I would not recommend going into a sewer. But I was asked to do an interview on the acoustic of a sewer, and I thought, well, I've never been in one. I'll go and see what it's like. And it was as revolting as you can imagine. But it had this most amazing acoustic effect. It was a cylindrical sewer, an old Victorian brick storm drain, and actually the sound would cling to the inside of the brickwork and spiral around and around in circles, and it was quite amazing. GROSS: So what did you learn acoustically from that smelly and disgusting but audio fascinating trip? COX: Well, I think the first thing I took from that was actually some amazing acoustics can be in the most unlikely of places. And some of the other places I went to, like the oil tank, are not immediately on your list of places to go to if you're thinking of acoustics, or nice places for that matter. But the other thing is that spiraling effect, what I realized was that's the kind of same effect as you get in whispering galleries. There's a variety of them around the world. In England the most famous one's St. Paul's Cathedral in London, where you go up into the base of the dome of St. Paul's Cathedral, and you whisper into the wall, and the sound skims around the inside of the dome to be heard by your friend, who's way, way across on the other side. And it sounds like the sound is emerging from the walls. And you have a conversation a hundred feet apart from each other. GROSS: So let's get back to those two different spaces that we heard the gun, the starting pistol, fired in. The first was a room specially designed to have no echo at all, and the second was this huge oil drum that is incredibly reverberating, lots and lots of echo. And we heard the difference of how a starting gun sounds fired in each. What's the moral of that story in terms of the kind of acoustics that you actually make your living doing, which is designing acoustics for theaters and concert halls? COX: Yeah, I mean those two examples are just interesting extremes. I mean, that oil tank is now the world record holder for its reverberation. And the anechoic chamber is the complete opposite. But actually when you design a room, you would never go to those two extremes because it's just not necessary, and it's also not very good. So if I wanted to design a place for music, let's say classical music, then I want a bit of reverberation because it makes music sound nicer. I mean it's a standard kind of thing that people even making pop music do is when they hear vocals, they put reverb on it just to make the sound blend a bit better. You know, when we go into a shower, we sing because we sound a little better with a little bit of that sort of blur going on. But you don't want too much. So that oil tank is too much because if you really reverb, then what happens is you get a mush, all the words and all the music just run into each other. So normally you would never have anything as reverberant as that oil tank or as dry as the anechoic chamber. GROSS: So when you're designing a concert hall that's going to hold symphony orchestras and also rock concerts, how do you design something that's going to be suitable for both? COX: Well, there's a few key things that we know are really important for a - let's say classic music to start with. We know that we want this reverberance, this sort of kind of sense that sound lingers a bit after the orchestra finishes, for a couple seconds is typically a design criteria. And to do that, concert halls are really very large, so normally if you sit in a concert hall and look up, you'll see it's a huge volume. It's really high ceiling. That's to give you that reverberance. But also we want to get rid of things which deaden the sound. You know, soft stuff like curtaining and carpets are all bad news. So actually if you look around a concert hall, all the walls and the ceiling are really hard materials. There's a sort of kind of myth around that the concert halls are made of wood so that the wood vibrates. But actually if you were to take the wood off, you'd find actually it's glued to concrete behind. There's no way that wood is vibrating at all. And a third sort of kind of key criteria would be also to make sure we get lots of sound from the sides because when we're outdoors - have you ever heard one of those concerts when they play outdoors? It all sounds like a bit remote, like the people are playing on the stage from a distance. In a concert hall you're kind of surrounded by sound. That sort of sense of envelopment is created by sound coming from the side, which is why halls, you know, something like Boston Symphony Hall is narrow and tall. It wasn't - we didn't know that when it was designed back in its day, but we now know why it works, is because it creates lots of sound from the side. GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is Trevor Cox. He's an acoustic engineer and the author of the new book \"The Sound Book: The Science of the Sonic Wonders of the World. \" Let's take a short break; then we'll talk some more. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is acoustic engineer Trevor Cox. He is a professor of acoustic engineering at the University of Salford in England. He's the author of the new book \"The Sound Book: The Science of the Sonic Wonders of the World. \" So we've been talking about the acoustics in concert halls and theaters. You say that cathedrals have natural reverb in it. Do you think - like what makes cathedrals so great for sound, old cathedrals? COX: Well, there's a couple of things. I think, first of all, from the point of view of, you know, a place to have a religious ceremony, I think we associate it with something very spiritual. And that's just to do with the very reverberant, echoey conditions in there, because if you go in there, and you start talking too loud, it echoes around and you're suddenly embarrassed. So it's kind of that very sort of hard surface, big volume, kind of forces us to whisper and therefore treat the place with a bit of reverence. So I think the spiritual sense in a church is really kind of dictated by the sort of conditions of these old Gothic cathedrals. And we kind of seem to associate that with a sense of spirituality. GROSS: Let's go back to the anechoic chamber, and that's the soundproof chamber with, like, no echo at all that we started talking about at the beginning of the interview. And this is the one where you fired the starting pistol, and it just sounded like a little pop. So does your ear, when you're in a place that's that soundproof, does your ear or your brain try to compensate for the lack of sound and find something to hear? COX: Yeah, it's one of the surprises when you take visitors into that anechoic chamber, is that they actually hear sound even though you say we're taking you into a completely silent room. And actually the sounds that you're hearing are ones you generate yourself. So you know, you've normally got your blood pumping through your body, including in your head, and normally that's not audible. But, you know, sometimes when you exercise, you get that pounding effect. So you can hear a bit of blood pumping sometimes in the anechoic chamber. And you can also sometimes hear a high-pitched hissing sound, and that's thought to be sort of the firings in the auditory nerve. I mean essentially what happens is your brain is tweaking the inner ear to try and pick up sound. It's kind of turning the volume up, really, of the inner ear. And it turns it up so far that you start hearing a bit of the nervous system working. So, you know, you can - there's a couple of sounds you hear, and that was what inspired John Cage's famous silent work \"4 Minute 33 Seconds. \" He went to an anechoic chamber across in the States at Harvard expecting find silence and then didn't find it, and that inspired his composition. GROSS: And that composition is four minutes and 33 seconds of just silence. Like he begins the piece, nothing happens. You're listening to the ambient sound around you. And then it ends after four minutes and 30 seconds. And it's kind of like an awareness composition of just, like, being aware of the sounds around you. COX: Yeah, it's a very interesting thing to go and hear. Actually, I went and heard a performance of it. And I mean the thought of paying to hear nothing sounds a bit odd in the first instance, but actually it was quite - it was a fascinating thing. And what happens is just like a music performance. So we had a pianist playing it, and they come on and then they bow and you clap, and all the standard stuff goes on except for nothing is actually played. And what becomes apparent as you listen to it is it's really all about the noise of audience. So it's - the performance is no longer really focused on the stage; it's focused on the people around you. And at the end of the performance, there was a round of applause and a sort of few ironic encores being shouted from the audience. And funny enough, I felt a real sense of collective endeavor. And that's what you get when you listen or make music, you get a sense of collective endeavor. So even though it's a slightly strange piece, it certainly felt like a piece of music. GROSS: When you spoke, I'm sure you tried speaking in the anechoic chamber, the soundproof room, did your voice sound different than you're used to? COX: Yeah, it sounds very different, and in fact some visitors find it quite unpleasant. It's a bit like when you go up in an aircraft and your ears need to pop. It sounds a bit like that. So all the voices are a bit muffled. And if you have to talk, you find yourself straining a bit. You find yourself working a little harder as you talk. And the thing that visitors don't like about it is because you see a room. It's very clearly - there's the walls all around you. They look odd, but they're clearly there. But your ear can't ear the room. And so your senses are a bit off-kilter. Your sense of vision and sense of sound are out of kilter. And some people feel a bit queasy and ask to leave. GROSS: What's the purpose of the room? COX: Well, if you want to measure anything in acoustic engineering, then you need to be able to sort of kind of isolate the effect of objects. If I had a loudspeaker, if I stick it in a room, I measure the loudspeaker, but I also measure all the effects of the room. If I take it into an anechoic chamber, I measure just the effects of the loudspeaker. So it's a way of isolating things, and it has to be incredibly quiet because we also measure very quiet things in there. So it's - it's really it's like an isolation booth for acoustic measurement. GROSS: You know, when you're - I'm sure coming out of a room with no sound, like a totally soundproof room like the anechoic chamber, when you emerge from that, you probably realize that there's just about no such thing as silence in the actual world, that there's always ambient sound around you, even when you think there's silence. COX: Yes, I think finding silence is actually quite difficult in the modern world. And the funny thing about the anechoic chamber for me is if you go into it a lot, because you've been there a lot of times, your brain gets used to it. So it knows it's an odd room. For me, it's just like walking into any other room now. So that startling sort of effect of coming out and suddenly your ears opening up to the sounds and suddenly things are less muffled, I don't get that anymore. It's only something you can really appreciate the first time in the space. GROSS: So one of the things that you discuss in your book is the sonic wonders that are happening out of our hearing, like the sounds underwater. And as an example, you actually brought an example with you of a recording made underwater. And I'd like you to introduce this for us and tell us what we're going to be hearing. COX: Yeah, this is recorded up near the Arctic, under the Arctic ice. And it's actually bearded seals calling out to each other. And to make this measurement, you need a hydrophone. I'm very lucky that Cornell University gave me a copy of this because this is one I haven't got to hear myself yet. GROSS: You mention a hydrophone. This is like a microphone under water? COX: Yeah, it's a microphone which works underwater. I mean, our hearing doesn't work very well under water. If you go swimming, you know that. And similarly, normal microphones don't work very well underwater, and you need special microphones designed to work in water. I mean aquatic animals use sound all the time because light doesn't travel very well in water. It soon disperses. It's hard to see what's going on. But sound can travel huge distances. And that's one of the things these bearded seals are doing, is they can communicate over huge distances with these low-frequency, sort of weird glissandos. GROSS: OK, so let's listen, and then you can tell us more about it. (SOUNDBITE OF SEALS) GROSS: I have to say that's the kind of sound you'd expect to hear in a science fiction movie. COX: Yeah, I mean it sounds like UFOs landing or something, doesn't it? I mean, there are some animals which make the most strange sounds. GROSS: And those were seals? COX: Yeah, they're bearded seals. And in - when you're - the males calling out to the females and quite possibly saying, you know, come over here, I'm the best male to mate with. And the thing is, the male's attracting the female by doing a song. And so what it does is it tries to show its vocal athleticism to show it's really particularly fit to be mated with. And I guess one of the things they might do is over time extend their glissandos longer and longer and longer because it's more and more impressive to the female. And it's common in animals. You know, you have these most strange sort of calls. But a sort of, kind of - it's a way of attracting the female or defending their territory. GROSS: So it's just amazing to think about all the sounds in the world that the human ear doesn't hear because either it's out of, you know, we're not underwater listening, or because it's out of the range of our hearing. But let me ask you. I don't know if you know the answer to this, but if you were - if you somehow managed to dive underwater in Alaska, where these seals are, where it's probably way too cold to dive, would you be hearing those glissandos? COX: Well, your ear is not particularly sensitive because it's not designed to sort of have waterways lapping against our eardrum and working. It's designed to have air pushing against our eardrum. So we certainly can hear something when we're underwater because of course if you go, I don't know, go into the swimming pool, you'll hear the radio on a side being sort of kind of still picked up. But it is quite muffled. So I would think that you probably could hear something, but it wouldn't be as impressive as if you picked it up on a hydrophone. GROSS: Right, so a hydrophone is designed to hear the things that the human ear wouldn't hear underwater. COX: Yeah, I mean a very common tool, if you're, say, the military wanting to sort of listen out for what's around, or if you're a fisherman wanting to send sonar signals out to try and find fish, or if you're, you know, oil exploration, and you wanted to kind of do seismology kind of testing, you need things in the water to pick up sound, and that's what the hydrophone is for. GROSS: Trevor Cox will be back in the second half of the show. His new book is called \"The Sound Book: The Science of the Sonic Wonders of the World. \" I'm Terry Gross and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross back with Trevor Cox, author of \"The Sound Book: The Science of the Sonic Wonders of the World. \"  He's an acoustic engineer who's designed sound for theaters and concert halls. He's also traveled extensively, documenting sonic wonders. When we left off, we were talking about a recording of bearded seals near Point Barrow, Alaska calling out to each other under water. The seals were recorded with a special microphone designed for underwater use called a hydrophone. Well, another recording you brought with you is of tadpoles munching on a hydrophone. Why would they be doing that? COX: Yeah. This was - I met an artist called Lee Patterson who's local to me in Manchester, and he likes to go and record in little sort of fishing lakes, not very big places, and pick up the sounds of tiny animals. So things like, you know, like water boatman or pond skaters, you know, they make - sort of sound a bit like crickets. But he - when he - when I met up with him, there were loads of tadpoles. It was in spring. And if you drop a hydrophone into them, the tadpoles will come along and try and eat it. And so what you hear is the sound of the sort of scraping of the tadpoles - they don't really have teeth but their sort of mouth parts - on the hydrophone. And it's a bit disconcerting because he handed me a pair of headphones to put on to listen to it because we were by the lake, and it really did sound like someone was scraping right at my ear. So it was a bit disconcerting. GROSS: Well, let's hear how disconcerting it is. This is tadpoles munching on a hydrophone. (SOUNDBITE OF TADPOLES MUNCHING ON A HYDROPHONE) GROSS: That is so odd. (LAUGHTER) GROSS: Right, it is. And when you consider how tiny - I don't know how amplified that is, but when you consider how tiny tadpoles are, that they'd be making that kind of munching sound? COX: Yeah. You have - it is - it's highly amplified, actually. And yeah, he's - because he's perfected his techniques for picking up these tiny little sounds. So yeah, you have to work quite hard to get that. But it is quite an amazing sound. And the world is full of these natural sounds. We think of natural sounds. We think of things like birds songs, but there's a whole variety of kind of crazy sort of animal sounds that you can pick up if you look out for them. GROSS: How does sound travel underwater? COX: Well, much more efficiently than it does in air. I mean, it's the same kind of process in the fact that you've got a wave, and in air, it's being passed from air molecule to air molecule whereas in underwater, it's being passed from water molecule to water molecule. And it just happens to be that in water it goes further, which is another reason why aquatic animals like to use it because it can travel huge, great distances underwater in a way that it never would do in the air. It would die away much quicker. GROSS: Let's talk about one of the sonic wonders of the world, which is a really familiar sound, and that's just like thunder. As an acoustic engineer, tell us your version of what's happening with loud thunder. COX: What's amazing with thunder is when you hear it, I mean, it's actually got that crack, and then it's got the rumble afterwards. As a kid, when you drew thunderstorms, you would've drawn the lightning with that jagged line. If you didn't have that jagged line, you wouldn't have the rumble of the thunder. So it's quite interesting how, you know, just something - a visual look of lightning is really crucial to how the thunder sounds. So when you draw a jagged line like that, each little kink is actually generating the sound. And the reason that a thunder rumbles is because the sound takes different time to come from different kinks because they're all slightly different distances from you. And that's the reason you get that very distinctive rumble sound. GROSS: Oh. I always figured the rumbling was because it was like echoing all around, you know, the buildings or the woods or wherever you were. COX: Well, I mean, in woods you will get echoing. But no, this is - the rumble is due to the fact that the sound is made all away along the lightning strike, all away along the sort of bright light because it's - I mean, it's basically created when the air is suddenly heated up. You get all these shockwaves generating. But because that strike, you know, those long, you know, bright light is all different distances from you, some of it arrives quickly from you because it's near you, and some of it arrives slower because it's further away. So you get this sort of extended sound. If you've ever been near when the lightning strike, you don't hear the rumble. You just hear their loud crack, really, and that rumble really - only really is more obvious the further away you are. GROSS: Why is wind noisy? COX: Well, wind on its own isn't particularly - it's going to hit something to make it noisy. And at Manchester at the moment, the best example of that is the Beetham Tower in the city center. So we have this tower block in the city center which howls in the wind. And we've just - as well as having a really damp January, a mild January, we've had a really, really windy winter. And only a couple of days ago, it was so loud. It was waking people up in the town center. And the wind itself was hitting - there's a structure on top of this Beetham Tower, which is a whole set of glass panes. And it was hitting those, and it was creating a whistling sound which is being amplified. So it's like some giant wind harp up here. And it creates all sorts of noise problems. GROSS: So when you say that wind doesn't make - wind isn't inherently noisy, what creates the noise? COX: What creates noise in the first place is turbulence. So if I was to pick up a beer bottle and blow across it, what you have is you got air sort of hitting the edge and creating sort of eddies. I mean, you see turbulence in the water. So if I have a smooth-running river and I put a rock in, you suddenly see that white water. That's turbulence of the water. The same thing is happening around the bottle neck. When I blow across it, you just can't see it obviously because it's sound and you can't see the air molecules moving. And then that sort of turbulence creates a sort of - kind of a vague noise. But it will lock into the resonance of the air in the main base of the bottle. And that's what actually creates a distinctive tone. And it's how flutes work. It's how - if you ever hear wind whistling past railings, that's what you get. You hear an Aeolian harp, it's created by turbulence in a slightly different way, but it's - mostly, it's created by turbulence of some form. GROSS: One of the things you've done - you have a very interesting website, and one of the things you've done is do a survey of what people find the most unpleasant noise in the world - the most unpleasant sound in the world. So what one? COX: Well, in my survey, yeah, people went online and listened to a whole variety, about 30 other sounds, and they scored them. The worst one was the sound of someone being sick, I'm afraid, which. . . GROSS: Somebody vomiting. Somebody retching. COX: Yeah. I'm afraid yeah. People not often like me mention it really, but that was came at the top. GROSS: So just curious, who did you record retching so that you could play it for people on this - for this survey on the Web? Well, I must admit it was an actress. There were - no real sick was generated in making it. It was actually just actors doing it. But it was a very good recording. It was a very good simulation. And the reason we find this unpleasant is a disgust reaction. So we have this sort of very strong aversive reaction to things that might carry something like disease. And obviously, if someone is being ill, then potentially they've got disease. And we're sort of kind of - we immediately think, oh, I must keep away from that. COX: And that's the reason it came top of the list, not only because it was just a superb recording or such a superb rendition. It was because we all universally have this sort of disgust reaction to avoid disease. Whereas you take fingernails down the blackboard, that scraping sound, which is the archetype worst sound, what we found is while some people found it really horrible, there are people who don't find it particularly unpleasant. So on average, it doesn't come top of the list. GROSS: Did you do the flip and ask what the most pleasing sound was? COX: I've always meant to do this experiment, but I've never actually done it. I mean, I think we know some of the stories. And in fact, you know, things like the warble of a bird song, you know, some really pleasant birds singing would be - probably come pretty high on lots of people's lists. But there's lots of them. I mean, my favorite would probably be thinking about to when my children were younger and they used to chatter to each other and play along with each other. And you'd just listen to their voices chatting and doing their sort of imaginary play. It was always very delightful to listen to. GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is Trevor Cox. He is an acoustic engineer and author of the new book \"The Sound Book: The Science of the Sonic Wonders of the World. \" Let's take a short break, then we'll talk some more. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is acoustic engineer Trevor Cox, author of the new book \"The Sound Book: The Science of the Sonic Wonders of the World. \" You know, earlier, we were talking about things that we don't know are making sounds underwater, and you played us the sound of seals underwater. It's also happening in the skies, things like bats with their sonar - these, you know, that they sent out to get a sense of where they are. Maybe you can explain why bats - what's happening with the bats, but I just want to say it's almost just quieting to think about all the sounds that are out there that are out of our range of hearing. We like to think of ourselves as being perceptive and really knowing what's happening in the real world, but there's all the stuff happening in the real world that we're just not capable of perceiving. COX: Yeah. It's quite interesting when you go and listen to bats. I mean, you have to take something along to listen to them. So you can buy bat detectors, which basically take the frequencies which are too high for us to hear and bring them down so you can hear them. And it's quite amazing to walk around at dusk and suddenly realize there's all these animals around that you never realized. And the thing that natural history would call - as Chris Watson made to me - that these - you think, oh, that's interesting. It's a nice click. But actually, these bats are out and hunting. So it's actually like a battle zone out there in the ultrasonic region, you know? There's frequencies we can't hear. They're actually battling to try and actually find the insects and kill them. So it's not quite as such as kind of a nice and sort of nature sort of sound as you might think. GROSS: So what is the sound that the bats emit and what is it for? COX: Well, it's a very short chirp, mostly. So it's a sound which is quite short and sweeps causing frequency very quickly. And they're listening for the reflection coming back. I mean, they're actually basically shouting, almost - you know, they work at real limits of how their vocal system and how their hearing system works, which is basically the same as ours, pretty much. So they're shouting these very short, little sort of chirps out. They bounce off objects, let's say, another insect or off a tree, then come back and by (unintelligible) what reflection is like, it can tell what it's reflected off, and also by how long it's taken, they can tell how far where the objects are. And that's how they navigate. I mean, there are people who do echolocate. As human beings, we do it. You can train yourself to do it if you wish. And there are blind people who do it. But it's a skill you have to learn. You can't just continuously pick up. GROSS: Echolocate so that you figure out where you are based on the reverberations of the sound of your clap or a voice or whatever? COX: Yeah. Most of the people who echolocate make a little click. You know, like, you would be going (makes noise) with your tongue or something like that. And then they hear the sound reflecting off the surfaces. And they can tell, you know, if they're close to a surface. That little click comes back slightly elongated so they know how far where the surface is. They listen to very subtle changes in the sound when they're looking at it. And, yes, it's amazing when you - when people do it because it's kind of a skillful thing to do and something you don't expect from a human. GROSS: What's one of the sonic wonders of the world that you find most fascinating that I have not yet asked you about? COX: It's really hard to pick a favorite - most amazing one, because there's just so many. But I must tell you, I really, you know, really enjoyed going to the Mojave Desert to hear the booming sand dunes. And I think when I first thought this idea of going to find this sort of amazing sounds in the world, half of my list was singing sands, because they had been written about for centuries. You know, Marco Polo, there's ancient Chinese writing on them, Charles Darwin wrote about them. So they're been known about for some time. But also there's a lot of scientific controversy. There's been groups arguing about what causes them, which has also interested - tweaked my scientific mind. But to go and see one is not very, you know, you can't hear this. It's not very easy because you need to find a desert. And there's no - I mean, the nearest one to England would probably be Morocco. But I hunt to be in America, so I went to southwest. There was quite a few around in the southwest. And the Kelso Dune to the Mojave Desert do it. So you climb up to this dune, which is really hard work. It's got to be really dry. It's got to be the heat of the summer. And the sand is really loose, because if it's not loose, it doesn't work. And you see, it's made when you walk across it, you got this burping sounds, you know, a bit like a badly played tuba going, even just walking across it. But the sound that people write about is the sound what you create with an avalanche. You find the right slope and you scoot down on your backside, and you'll get this rumbling sound which drone that picks up a bit like a taxiing aircraft. And actually you can feel the whole surface vibrate underneath you. It's quite an amazing effect. GROSS: So did you do that? COX: Yeah. We were - we were unlucky on day one. We got - we arrived then - we couldn't it to work. And someone had said Kelso Dunes wasn't as tuneful as it used to be. So we went back and sort of evaluated, you know, overnight, looked back at, you know, some of the papers people have written about. And so it's kind of trying to work out. And I think the mistake we made on day one is we looked at this big dune and thought, all right, let's go to the top. We'll start there. Well, actually, the best slope was about three quarters the way up. So on the second day, we found the one which was better angle to the wind. And the thing is what happens when these sand grains have to be all roughly the same size. They have to be, roughly, spherical. They have to have special varnish on them. So you see, there's a weird sifting happening of the - of the sand grains in the wind in the Mojave Desert. And so you have to find one which is quite, you know, a bit of the dune, which is at the right angle to the prevailing wind direction as well. And I think, the first day, we weren't quite at the right angle. Day two, we got it better. We found a bigger slope. And we got some beautiful drones. GROSS: So you actually have a recording of this singing sand dune. Do you want to introduce it for us? COX: Yeah. There's two recordings actually worth playing. The first one is this burping effect, as it's described. And it's just me walking up the dune. You might even hear me panting a bit because it's quite hard work. GROSS: OK. Let's go with that. (SOUNDBITE OF SINGING SAND DUNES) COX: The second sound which is the - this more famous droning sound is that me coming down on my backside and creating an avalanche. And it's quite low frequency, so you need to turn the bass up to hear it. GROSS: And is that really an avalanche or just a sound of an avalanche? COX: It's not just synchronized avalanche of all the drains. So all the drains move in one, and therefore create sort of a sound, which is very tonal. Normally, with an avalanche, it's just like a snow avalanche. Everything is just a kind of general sort of noise. But the - because the grains are all the same size, they slip past each other in synchronization. You get this amazing droning sound. GROSS: OK. Let's hear it. (SOUNDBITE OF SINGING SAND DUNE) (SOUNDBITE OF HUM) GROSS: Do you find it really weird when something makes a sound that it doesn't seem to be capable of making? Like why would sand make a sound like that? COX: Yeah. To me when I was looking for these sort of sonic wonders, one of my things was, you know, what to go and see. I could go and see lots of things. And I think the sounds which are remarkable are some of the ones which are surprising. And to me, I've been to lots of sand dunes in my time but none of them make a sound. You know, I had to work quite hard to find this place. And that's what makes it remarkable. There's only - there are about 40 documented around the world which make that particular sound. There's probably a few more to be found, but people don't tend to go into the middle of deserts to find them. So there's probably a few more but they're relatively rare. And also, it's just - you know, also it had a nice kind of sad story behind it, which was another reason why I wanted to visit. GROSS: Since you're listening so carefully for things how do you take care of your ears? COX: Very carefully when I can. So I play the saxophone and I have ear plugs with me, special musicians ones which I'll wear if I'm in a band and it's too loud. So, yeah. No, I do quite a lot of care of my hearing. Unfortunately, I have just developed tinnitus to do with a problem, not to do with noise exposure, which is very annoying. GROSS: You've developed tinnitus? COX: Yeah. I developed a ringing in the ear due to an infection in my ear which is a very annoying thing to, kind of, get as an acoustic engineer but unfortunately it's just one of those things. There's no real cure. So you just kind of put up with it. GROSS: Describe the sensation. COX: Well, it's just - it's relatively quiet, actually, so it's not too bad but ringing in the ear, for people the sounds are very different. You know, some people describe whooshing sounds, sometimes hissing, sometimes buzzing sounds. Because we don't really fully understand how they're created but it's very individual. And mine is just a sort of general high pitched tone which you can hear if I go into a very quiet space. It's not always there but it's sometimes there and it's very annoying. GROSS: And what do doctors tell you about why you're hearing that sound? COX: Well, yeah, and tinnitus is kind of - well, there are some debates about what actually creates tinnitus. And it could be the fact that we have connections back from our brain to our ear and it could be something to do with our brain generating that sound. So there's debates about whether the generation is in the inner ear or it's along the auditory nerve or it's somewhere in the brain. So that's still being debated and until we know exactly what's causing it, there's not really going to be a cure for it. So it's - unfortunately, a lot of people sort of know things about hearing loss but, actually, one of the things you get when you get hearing loss is often tinnitus and that can be very distressing. It can keep people awake. It can make it difficult for them to work. So it can be a very difficult condition to live with. Mine's mild. It's just annoying; it's not doing me any great harm. GROSS: Does the tinnitus get amplified when you're in the anechoic chamber, the totally soundproof room? COX: Yeah. Well, it certainly becomes noticeable. So I can't hear it now at the moment. There's just enough noise around here, even though I'm in a studio, that I can't hear it. So I have to be in very quiet conditions. It is very mild tinnitus. So, yeah, an anechoic chamber if I go - I mean, I have been to silent places. Like the desert was silent for times. And, actually, when I was in the desert I hadn't got the tinnitus yet. I'll have to go out to the desert. So I didn't hear it then but I would imagine in very quiet places I would hear it - out in the countryside as well. GROSS: And just one more thing. You play saxophone, so I assume you really love music. You write that music activates more of the brain than any other known stimulus. I guess maybe that's why music is just so satisfying. COX: Yes. It is a most amazing stimulus and what's curious about it in a sense you think, well, why do we make music? I suppose the obvious answer is because we like it but then why did we develop it in the first place? You know, is it just purely a pleasure thing or is there some purpose? And there's lots of debates about what, you know, why do we have this signal which can so tap into our emotions. I mean one of the suggestions is that it's kind of a bonding thing that enables us to socialize and, you know, bring us together in a group and that's really handy because, you know, we're a social animal and we succeed at being in groups. But there are other suggestions that basically it's almost like a parasitic thing. We could make it and therefore we did and it's just sort of pleasure. It's a bit like taking a drug: we don't need to do it but we decided it would be nice. GROSS: Well, Trevor Cox, thank you so much for talking with us. COX: Oh, it's been great. Thanks very much.

Scientists are concerned about the potential environmental impact, but NPR's Richard Harris reports conservationists have so far paid little attention to the mega project. RICHARD HARRIS, BYLINE: People have been thinking about digging a canal across Nicaragua from the Atlantic to the Pacific for more than a century and the idea has never gone anywhere. But that may be about to change. The latest plan has strong support from the Nicaraguan government and this is not a modest proposal. AXEL MEYER: To compete with the Panama Canal, this has to be a huge canal in terms of the width and the depth of the canal. HARRIS: Axel Meyer is a German biologist who's done field work in Nicaragua for 30 years. He's watched with increasing alarm as the canal plan has gained momentum. The canal would literally cut the country in two, creating a biological barrier. And the route would traverse the largest source of fresh water in Central America: Lake Nicaragua. MEYER: So also that entire lake would have to be dredged and kept open during the operation and that's something that's a major concern in terms of sedimentation and the whole impact on the wetlands around the lake. HARRIS: Not to mention the risk of oil spills. Connecting the lake to the Gulf of Mexico to the east would presumably follow the trace of one of the small river systems. Meyer went out last October to look at some of the possible routes. MEYER: It's unfathomable for me to envision these huge, huge ocean liners and ships going through these small streams. In the dry season, you can walk through there, drive your car through there. HARRIS: To voice his concerns, Meyer co-wrote a commentary in Nature magazine with Jorge Huete-Perez, from the University of Central America in Managua. He's also heads the Nicaraguan Academy of Sciences. JORGE HUETE-PEREZ: We don't really know what's happening. We just know the concession was given to this company. There were no environmental studies. And they're doing their own environmental study. HARRIS: Huete says that's a conflict of interest. So far, the company hasn't even said what route the canal would take. Yet they plan to have the environmental assessment wrapped up quickly so construction can start next year. HUETE-PEREZ: Most of our experts are saying that you would need two or three years and many, many people working on this to be able to complete these studies. And yet, you know, they want to do something, like, in three months. HARRIS: The Chinese company that's running the project says it's hired a firm called Environmental Resources Management to do the assessment. Its offices in Washington and Houston didn't return NPR's phone calls. The canal also seems dubious because it would be a much longer and slower route than the Panama Canal. Huete says it seems so crazy, he's having trouble convincing global conservation groups to take it seriously. HUETE-PEREZ: People are not really paying attention because they think this is not going to happen and yet, you know, this might be part of the problem. HARRIS: It may be speeding forward because there is no vocal opposition. Carl Meacham, director of the Americas program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, says there are huge risks if the project does advance with little regard for international legal and environmental standards. CARL MEACHAM: I think that that would be quite negative and I think that the United States and other countries would probably voice their opinions.

Kaku shifts from physics to neuroscience for his new book called \"The Future of the Mind. \" He says we can think of the brain as a large corporation. MICHIO KAKU: Now, we used to think the brain was like a computer. But now, we realize that's not true. There's no programming of the brain. There's no Windows. And we think the brain is more like a large corporation. Because think of the unconscious mind. In a corporation, you have subdivisions which operate independently of the main office. And that's why we have an unconscious mind, because you have to have, for example, emotional reactions to things very quickly. And so the organization of the brain is in some sense very much like a large bureaucracy. RATH: I know this is something you wrestle with in the book - how does something like consciousness emerge out of this corporation? KAKU: Well, consciousness, there are about 20,000 papers on consciousness with no consensus. Nowhere in history have so many people devoted so much time to produce so little. But our consciousness differs because we simulate the future. Animals have no conception of tomorrow. We do. We constantly are daydreaming, constantly planning for tomorrow, constantly thinking about things that happened even beyond our lifetime. RATH: Sounds related to a similar definition I've heard in the past from philosophers that what sets us apart is a knowledge of our own mortality, the idea that there will one day not be a me. KAKU: That's right. We can imagine things far beyond our body. And so these are three levels of consciousness. Consciousness-one level is understanding where we are in space. Consciousness two is where we understand our position in society: who's top dog, who's underdog and who's in the middle. And type-three consciousness is simulating the future. And type-three consciousness, only humans have this ability to see far into the future. RATH: Can you talk about what modern technology has been able to tell us about the mystery of consciousness? KAKU: Well, we've learned more in the last 10, 15 years than in all of human history. In fact, we can take the consciousness of somebody who is totally paralyzed, cannot do anything with their body, put a chip in their brain and have that person control a laptop. They can now surf the Web, they can now write emails, answer emails, control their wheelchair, control household appliances and even manipulate mechanical arms and eventually a mechanical exoskeleton. Stephen Hawking, my colleague, is totally paralyzed, and he has a chip in his right glass. Next time you see him on television, look in his right frame, and you see a brain sensor which picks up radio from his brain and allows him to type mentally. RATH: And the fact that our brains and bodies can interface with machines in this way, what does that tell us about, you know, our idea of our self and our consciousness? KAKU: Well, President Barack Obama stunned the scientific community last year in the State of the Union Address announcing the Brain Project. Just like the Human Genome Project revolutionized genetics in medicine, the Brain Project of America and the European Union will allocate over a billion dollars to map all the sequences and pathways of the human brain. The short-term goal is to understand and cure mental illness, one of the greatest afflictions in the history of the human race. The Bible mentions mental illness, for example. And even beyond that, if you have a CD-ROM with all our pathways on it, that's sort of like brain 2. 0. Philosophers have asked the question: if we have a CD-ROM with all our neural pathways on it, perhaps consciousness is nothing but information, and this information can live forever. This has philosophical implications. RATH: Isn't that - couldn't you say that's kind of reductive, though, that just because these processes can be mirrored by machines or even, you know, mimicked by machines, you're still - that's not the same as if you're mapping out of neurons. That's not the same thing as getting the essence of a person, of that cell. KAKU: Well, it all depends on how you define the word you. What are you? If you are a mass of soft tissue and bones and so on, so forth, then you're absolutely right. These things look like no more than sophisticated tape recorders. They are not conscious in the sense that our neurons are conscious. But if that set of neurons, mechanical transistors eventually become so sophisticated, is basically a carbon copy, then perhaps there's a new definition of you. Perhaps you can exist independent of your body. Now, of course, we've seen this on \"Star Trek,\" we've seen this in the movies, but now things that we think of as science fiction are now entering the laboratories of people working on this brain initiative, this $1 billion initiative to understand mental illness and what is the human consciousness. RATH: Would you want your brain to be downloaded, to have a copy made of your mind? KAKU: Well, you know, in the movie \"Back to the Future,\" Doc Brown is asked the question: Do you want to see the future? And he says: I've always wanted to see beyond my years. (SOUNDBITE OF MOVIE, \"BACK TO THE FUTURE\")KAKU: You see, I'm also a futurist. I dream about the world 50, 100, maybe even 1,000 years in the future. But I also realize I'm probably not going to see it. However, I wouldn't mind having at least a copy of myself see the future, maybe 50, 100, 1,000 years into the future. It would be a fantastic ride. RATH: Michio Kaku's new book is called \"The Future of the Mind. \" Thank you so much. KAKU: Glad to be on your show. ARUN RATH, HOST:   Michio Kaku is famous for explaining some of the weirder mysteries of the universe in books like \"Hyper Space. \" But he has shifted his attention to a much smaller system: the brain. Kaku shifts from physics to neuroscience for his new book called \"The Future of the Mind. \" He says we can think of the brain as a large corporation. MICHIO KAKU: Now, we used to think the brain was like a computer. But now, we realize that's not true. There's no programming of the brain. There's no Windows. And we think the brain is more like a large corporation. Because think of the unconscious mind. In a corporation, you have subdivisions which operate independently of the main office. And that's why we have an unconscious mind, because you have to have, for example, emotional reactions to things very quickly. And so the organization of the brain is in some sense very much like a large bureaucracy. RATH: I know this is something you wrestle with in the book - how does something like consciousness emerge out of this corporation? KAKU: Well, consciousness, there are about 20,000 papers on consciousness with no consensus. Nowhere in history have so many people devoted so much time to produce so little. But our consciousness differs because we simulate the future. Animals have no conception of tomorrow. We do. We constantly are daydreaming, constantly planning for tomorrow, constantly thinking about things that happened even beyond our lifetime. RATH: Sounds related to a similar definition I've heard in the past from philosophers that what sets us apart is a knowledge of our own mortality, the idea that there will one day not be a me. KAKU: That's right. We can imagine things far beyond our body. And so these are three levels of consciousness. Consciousness-one level is understanding where we are in space. Consciousness two is where we understand our position in society: who's top dog, who's underdog and who's in the middle. And type-three consciousness is simulating the future. And type-three consciousness, only humans have this ability to see far into the future. RATH: Can you talk about what modern technology has been able to tell us about the mystery of consciousness? KAKU: Well, we've learned more in the last 10, 15 years than in all of human history. In fact, we can take the consciousness of somebody who is totally paralyzed, cannot do anything with their body, put a chip in their brain and have that person control a laptop. They can now surf the Web, they can now write emails, answer emails, control their wheelchair, control household appliances and even manipulate mechanical arms and eventually a mechanical exoskeleton. Stephen Hawking, my colleague, is totally paralyzed, and he has a chip in his right glass. Next time you see him on television, look in his right frame, and you see a brain sensor which picks up radio from his brain and allows him to type mentally. RATH: And the fact that our brains and bodies can interface with machines in this way, what does that tell us about, you know, our idea of our self and our consciousness? KAKU: Well, President Barack Obama stunned the scientific community last year in the State of the Union Address announcing the Brain Project. Just like the Human Genome Project revolutionized genetics in medicine, the Brain Project of America and the European Union will allocate over a billion dollars to map all the sequences and pathways of the human brain. The short-term goal is to understand and cure mental illness, one of the greatest afflictions in the history of the human race. The Bible mentions mental illness, for example. And even beyond that, if you have a CD-ROM with all our pathways on it, that's sort of like brain 2. 0. Philosophers have asked the question: if we have a CD-ROM with all our neural pathways on it, perhaps consciousness is nothing but information, and this information can live forever. This has philosophical implications. RATH: Isn't that - couldn't you say that's kind of reductive, though, that just because these processes can be mirrored by machines or even, you know, mimicked by machines, you're still - that's not the same as if you're mapping out of neurons.

Ben Saunders and Tarka L'Herpiniere set out to complete the route taken by the famous explorer Robert Scott in 1912. Scott and his entire team died on the journey. Saunders and L'Herpiniere's goal was to walk the entire way without assistance and without losing anyone. Happily, they made it. Ben Saunders is back home in London, and he joins me now to talk about the expedition. Ben, welcome. BEN SAUNDERS: Hi. RATH: So are you tired? SAUNDERS: I am - yes. Exhausted. I think one of the strange things is that I've, you know, I've shaved off my big beard, and I've already put on a few pounds again. So I don't look much different to when I left the U. K. nearly five months ago. But my legs definitely are very, very weak. RATH: How did you prepare for this physically? SAUNDERS: It was an enormous physical challenge. We both trained for it like athletes. So about 20 hours a week of training on average for a year building up to the expedition. So a lot of running, a lot of cycling, a lot of days away in the mountains, the hills. We did a training expedition in Greenland. We also put on weight. We both put on about 22, 24 pounds each before we set off. So we had essentially stored energy reserves and also a bit of padding, a bit of insulation for the extreme cold. RATH: And what's been great for those of us who are unable to make that kind of a trip was that you did this blogging. You were blogging all along the way, numbering the days as you went. SAUNDERS: We were. We were a relatively high-tech expedition. We had some fantastic support from Intel. We developed a totally custom-made satellite communication system. We could edit photographs, we could compress video, and we'd send back a blog post every night for 105 days. And we had a huge audience around the world. So that was - to me was really satisfying to have to do that. RATH: And things got a lot more difficult in the second half of the trek. I want to talk about day 70 of your expedition. You were running low on food. And how did that happen? SAUNDERS: Yeah. We always knew this was going to be a journey that was at the very margins of what was possible, you know, physically, mentally. And the conditions on the higher plateau were just a lot more challenging and a lot more debilitating than we'd expected. So we were slightly slower than we thought and therefore had fewer days to make it back to our first depot of food. And Tarka became hypothermic. I became hypothermic a few days later. So we just decided that we really needed some more food and some more fuel. So we called for a resupply flight, yeah, a few days after the pole. RATH: What was it like when you saw that plane coming? SAUNDERS: We - I think we just had very mixed feelings. You know, we were - we've been waiting for the plane. It took about 12 hours to reach us. We - and looking back, I've got absolutely no regrets at all. You know, the primary aim for us was to get home in one piece, and anything beyond that was a bonus really. And certainly finishing the journey was far more important than whether we took a resupply or not. So - but, you know, waiting for the plane to turn up, we had really mixed feelings. And, of course, when it actually arrived with all this food for us, it was like Christmas. It was fantastic. RATH: So the expedition is over now. You mentioned that you're tired and have been trying to eat a bit more, but any other lingering physical effects or even psychological effects from this trip? SAUNDERS: At the moment, I just feel very fatigued and, I think, sort of mentally quite slow. And I think that's just a result of the extreme fatigue. I'm sort of hoping that everything will come back to normal. Physically, no injuries, no lasting damage. And I've got some, you know, the fingers of my right hand are kind of numb, but that's just temporary (unintelligible) damage. I've had that before in expeditions, so I'm relatively normal. And I've put on a surprising amount of weight. So I certainly don't look too bad. RATH: Ben Saunders is just back from an expedition to the South Pole. Ben, thank you. SAUNDERS: Real pleasure.

The industry is fighting back, though some facilities say the new rules aren't so bad. Today, the Supreme Court will hear that argument. NPR's Elizabeth Shogren has more. ELIZABETH SHOGREN, BYLINE: What the EPA is doing is making companies get greenhouse gas permits whenever they build, say, a chemical plant or a refinery. Even if they just modify their big plant, they need to get a permit. JEFFREY HOLMSTEAD: It's added cost. It certainly has added some delays. It does add additional time for the process. SHOGREN: Industry lawyer Jeffrey Holmstead says companies are taking the EPA to court because these delays can even derail a project. They also think the EPA has contorted the law, the Clean Air Act, to make it fit greenhouse gases. HOLMSTEAD: The law passed by Congress said that anyone who emits more than 250 tons a year of a pollutant needs a permit, and EPA said, well, that would be absurd, that would lead to an absurd result. SHOGREN: Even a small building can pump out 250 tons of greenhouse gases in a year. So, basically the EPA modified the law so that it applies only to big factories. Industry wasn't satisfied with that. Neither were some states. Lawyer Boyden Gray represents some of them in this case. He says EPA's misusing the law. BOYDEN GRAY: If it's that absurd that you have to go through that many somersaults to make the thing remotely rational, then maybe you've interpreted the statute wrong to begin with. SHOGREN: Gray says the states worry the EPA will eventually require smaller facilities to get permits, and in time, even churches and apartment houses might need them. GRAY: Eventually the nightmare will unfold. SHOGREN: But some companies say hold on - they've gotten these permits and it's no big deal. Calpine Corporation has gotten six of these greenhouse gas permits for power plants in California, Texas and Delaware. DEREK FURSTENWERTH: We haven't found this permitting program to be overly cumbersome or expensive. We haven't seen any significant increase in permitting times, really. SHOGREN: Derek Furstenwerth is the company's senior director for environmental services. Calpine actually filed a legal brief with the Supreme Court defending the program. The way Calpine sees it, the company hasn't had to buy expensive new pollution control equipment. Furstenwerth says it's just had to build plants that will get the most electricity out of the fuel they burn. FURSTENWERTH: So, it winds up that the permitting process and our economic interests in building the plants are pretty well aligned. SHOGREN: So far, the EPA says, 141 facilities have gotten permits. The EPA declined requests for an interview. In an email, it said the permit program is working smoothly and most companies comply by making their facilities more energy efficient. The agency says it currently has no plans to require permits from smaller facilities, but the agency would have to revisit this in a couple of years. Vickie Patton is general counsel for Environmental Defense Fund. She says the industry's challenge ignores the fact that the Supreme Court generally gives the EPA wide deference to interpret the law. VICKIE PATTON: It's a very legalist argument that's designed to prevent EPA from protecting America's families and communities from climate pollution. SHOGREN: But Patton says what's really crucial about this case is that it doesn't threaten what's most important. PATTON: This case is not about EPA's authority to address climate pollution under the nation's clean air laws. SHOGREN: Industry lawyer Jeffrey Holmstead actually agrees. HOLMSTEAD: This is a very narrow case. I think the outcome won't really have much of an impact, one way or another, on EPA's ability to regulate carbon. SHOGREN: That's because this is only one small part of the EPA's strategy for fighting global warming. Still to come are more ambitious rules to bring down emissions, even further, for new and existing power plants. Elizabeth Shogren, NPR News, Washington.

NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce reports on bit of crystal that is so old, it can tell us about some of the Earth's earliest days. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE, BYLINE: Our planet's history stretches back more than four and a half billion years. First a spinning cloud of gas and dust coalesced to become our sun. Then clumps of matter started slamming together, forming planets. Scientists think that after a proto-Earth emerged, an object the size of Mars smashed into it. The crash created our moon and turned the Earth into a red ball of molten rock. JOHN VALLEY: It would have glowed almost like a star. Nothing could exist on the surface. There would be no continental land masses. There'd be no liquid water. And there certainly would have been no life at that time. GREENFIELDBOYCE: John Valley is a geochemist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. He wonders: How long did those fiery conditions last? When did land appear, when did our planet become homey? Valley thinks it happened pretty quickly. And his evidence lies inside ancient sand grains that were once part of an early continent. VALLEY: These are the oldest known materials from the Earth. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Valley says the sand grains are actually tiny zircon crystals. VALLEY: So if you have one zircon in the palm of your hand, you won't see it without a magnifying glass. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Some crystals have jagged edges, others look like smooth jellybeans. VALLEY: The colors can be anything from a transparent to a deep red. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Geologists found them on a sheep ranch in a remote part of Australia in sandstones that, three billion years ago, were a beach. VALLEY: It's always blown my mind, I mean to collect samples that were on a beach three billion years ago and to find crystals that were more than a billion years older even than the beach is just really surprising and wonderful. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Back in 2001, Valley and some colleagues reported that one of these grains was around 4. 4 billion years old, so old that not everyone believed it. VALLEY: There have been challenges because nothing in science goes without being questioned; it always has to be proven. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Valley and his colleagues had determined the crystal's age by analyzing how much of the element uranium had decayed into lead. They did this by looking at a small part of the crystal. But some scientists pointed out a problem - lead atoms might move around inside the crystal. VALLEY: And if that happens, in the places where it's concentrated, you will measure an older age than the true age. GREENFIELDBOYCE: So Valley's team recently tackled this issue with a powerful new instrument that can pluck out and identify individual atoms. They found that, yes, lead does move around but not enough to affect their age calculations. So they do have the oldest known material of any kind formed on Earth. Sam Bowring is a geologist at MIT. He says it's pretty hard to argue with this new study, which appears in the journal Nature Geoscience. SAM BOWRING: I think people will be impressed with the technique and impressed with the conclusions and agree with them. GREENFIELDBOYCE: He says it means continents must have formed just tens of millions of years after the big impact that created the moon. BOWRING: I think that really is profound, if you think about it, and now we're talking about a history on this planet that goes back to almost the day that the planet was born. GREENFIELDBOYCE: He says if geologists are lucky, someday they'll stumble over a big rock as old as these little crystals. Nell Greenfieldboyce, NPR News.

VALLEY: It's always blown my mind, I mean to collect samples that were on a beach three billion years ago and to find crystals that were more than a billion years older even than the beach is just really surprising and wonderful. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Back in 2001, Valley and some colleagues reported that one of these grains was around 4. 4 billion years old, so old that not everyone believed it. VALLEY: There have been challenges because nothing in science goes without being questioned; it always has to be proven. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Valley and his colleagues had determined the crystal's age by analyzing how much of the element uranium had decayed into lead. They did this by looking at a small part of the crystal. But some scientists pointed out a problem - lead atoms might move around inside the crystal. VALLEY: And if that happens, in the places where it's concentrated, you will measure an older age than the true age. GREENFIELDBOYCE: So Valley's team recently tackled this issue with a powerful new instrument that can pluck out and identify individual atoms. They found that, yes, lead does move around but not enough to affect their age calculations. So they do have the oldest known material of any kind formed on Earth. Sam Bowring is a geologist at MIT. He says it's pretty hard to argue with this new study, which appears in the journal Nature Geoscience. SAM BOWRING: I think people will be impressed with the technique and impressed with the conclusions and agree with them. GREENFIELDBOYCE: He says it means continents must have formed just tens of millions of years after the big impact that created the moon. BOWRING: I think that really is profound, if you think about it, and now we're talking about a history on this planet that goes back to almost the day that the planet was born. GREENFIELDBOYCE: He says if geologists are lucky, someday they'll stumble over a big rock as old as these little crystals.

I'm Dave Davies, in for Terry Gross, who's off this week. Our guest, Neil DeGrasse Tyson, is an astrophysicist and director of the Hayden Planetarium at the Museum of Natural History in New York. But that doesn't begin to tell you who he is. Tyson is a prolific writer, having authored many books and essays, and he may be the country's most frequently quoted and interviewed authority on astronomy in the popular media. He's hosted a four-part series on PBS's \"Nova\" and appeared everywhere from \"The Tonight Show\" to \"The Daily Show\" to NPR's WAIT WAIT. . . DON'T TELL ME! This spring he hosts a new 13-part TV series, \"Cosmos: A Space-Time Odyssey. \" It begins March 9 on Fox and March 10 on the National Geographic Channel. The programs recall and update the influential series \"Cosmos: A Personal Journey,\" which Carl Sagan hosted on PBS in 1980. Tyson worked with Ann Druyan, Sagan's widow, in developing the new series. Here's a moment from the first episode, which begins with Carl Sagan and finishes with Tyson. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"COSMOS: A SPACE-TIME ODYSSEY\")CARL SAGAN: The cosmos is all that is or ever was or ever will be. Come with me. NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: A generation ago, the astronomer Carl Sagan stood here and launched hundreds of millions of us on a great adventure: the exploration of the universe revealed by science. It's time to get going again. DAVIES: Well, Neil DeGrasse Tyson, welcome to FRESH AIR. A lot of us who are old enough to have seen the original series remember it dimly, and of course you've been involved in it again. Looking back on it, what struck you about it? What did you want to honor? TYSON: Well, I, at the time, it was 1980 when it first aired, and I was entering graduate school in astrophysics. So \"Cosmos,\" unlike its influence on others, where it may have first awakened them to the glories of the universe or to science, for me I was already sort of a committed student to the subject. So for me its influence was primarily an existence proof that a scientist can communicate with the public in a manner that was very different from professor in front of a classroom or you know, pontificating from up on high. His style was very conversation and fireside chatty, and there he was on the screen, but he was really with you in the living room. And I said to myself, if I'm ever in a position to communicate with the public on such a scale that I would want to do it in that way. DAVIES: I want to play a clip from the first episode, and in this one you're explaining a narrative device that was also used in the original series, the cosmic calendar, which gives us a sense of the scale of the 13. 8 billion years that have passed since the beginning of the universe. Let's listen. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"COSMOS: A SPACE-TIME ODYSSEY\")TYSON: The cosmic calendar begins on January 1 with the birth of our universe. It contains everything that's happened since then, up to now, which on this calendar is midnight December 31. On this scale, every month represents about a billion years. Every day represents nearly 40 million years. Let's go back as far as we can, to the very first moment of the universe, January 1, the big bang. It's as far back as we can see in time, for now. (SOUNDBITE OF EXPLOSION)DAVIES: Kaboom. (LAUGHTER)TYSON: I donned sunglasses for that one. DAVIES: That's from the series \"The Cosmos\" on Fox TV, which will be hosted by our guest Neil DeGrasse Tyson. You know, I played that in part because of that huge boom. We see you actually kind of experiencing the big bang. You know, the blast kind of shakes your clothing and all. TYSON: Yeah, and not getting vaporized, right. We needed special clothing for that. (LAUGHTER)DAVIES: And somehow surviving it. And it kind of raises the question of, you know, the tradeoff between kind of substance and show biz. And I know you've done a lot of popular science education. I suspect this is something that you deal with a lot. Talk a little bit about how you address that issue. TYSON: Well, the very question presumes that one of the two has to be compromised for the both to be successful, and I don't agree with that premise. I think if you have not thought deeply about how to communicate science, you might get stuck saying, OK, I have to dumb this down, or I have to be flashy but with no real content. But if you really think deeply about the visualizations, the effects, the visual effects, and the content, you get to have both. And I don't think I've ever been accused of dumbing anything down. The audience knows it if you're dumbing it down. In the \"Cosmos\" series, I'm speaking real science to you, and the visualizations are supporting that real science. So yeah, the big bang is as far back in time as we can see. These are just facts. And yeah, the cosmic calendar is an awesome way to capture the flow of events in a way that we can kind of understand better, can kind of relate to. On a cosmic calendar, our galaxy, our galaxy forms on March 15. So the universe has been around for a while before we formed. Our solar system forms August 31. You can calculate this out and find out where it fits. These are visualization tools. So yeah, I don't see that as a tradeoff, at all. DAVIES: Right, I didn't mean to suggest that you were compromising the science in doing all that. TYSON: Yes you did. (LAUGHTER)DAVIES: No, I didn't. But what I do suspect is that there are people involved in the production that, you know, without the diligent care might do that, and there are probably times you've got to say not so fast, that isn't quite right. TYSON: Oh yeah, I'm all over him if that happens, and the good thing about the universe in this, the 21st century, we have extraordinary sources of data, the Hubble Telescope and many other telescopes that are just as important but don't have quite the PR machine that the Hubble did, that inform the visualizations that we provide. So there's a limit to the freedom that an artist is given to portray things. You know, if you look at a first-run movie, they just want the thing to look good, whether or not it follows laws of physics. And occasionally I'm on top of them too, after the fact. I commented on the film \"Gravity\". . . DAVIES: I was going to bring that up. Yeah, I think you did this on Twitter. Why don't you share some of the kind of scientific inaccuracies in \"Gravity\". . . TYSON: Well, yeah, so \"Cosmos\" has, as its priority, to get the science right above all else, and we will then tell the story with the properly represented science. In Hollywood, in the dramas that are portrayed, I think they sometimes take some latitudes either out of ignorance or because they feel as though the truth would somehow constrain their flexibility of storytelling. And in the film \"Gravity,\" I saw that pretty early, I mean, maybe day two or something, and I just felt compelled to put out, you know, 10 tweets or so on things I thought they could have gotten right, but they didn't get right. And I phrase them mysteries of \"Gravity,\" one of which was: Why is it that Sandra Bullock, who's portraying a medical doctor, is fixing my Hubble Space Telescope? Get her the hell off my telescope. (LAUGHTER)TYSON: As an astrophysicist, I don't walk into her operating room and say I've got this, open-heart surgery. I'm an astrophysicist. So, little things, they're just little things like that, and I was just having fun. And by the way, I don't spend that much energy commenting on a movie unless I think the movie has deserved it, has earned it in particular. I don't comment on the physics errors of \"Star Wars,\" all right. I just - you let that one go. So the fact that I even did this, for me, was quite a compliment to the film. DAVIES: Give us a couple more examples of science that wasn't quite right there. TYSON: For example, her hair. Her hair should've been sort of floating in zero-G, and it was not. It was like there was heavy mousse or something kept that stuff down. (LAUGHTER)DAVIES: We wouldn't have liked that look. That's the problem there. TYSON: I know, and that's what we - that's the first thing we notice when we see astronauts floating in space, is the hair just sticking up, and it's kind of comical and funny, and it's the great reminder that they're in zero-G. Also this poignant scene where they're at opposite ends of a tether, and George Clooney character says, you know, I'm going to unclip because if you try to come get me, we'll both die, right? So it's this noble, the right stuff kind of move. And then he unclips and then floats away. I'm thinking, no, that's not how physics work. If you are - if the system is not rotating, which it wasn't because Earth was just stationary in the background, and if he unclips, he would just stay there. And all she needed to do was give a tiny little tug, the tiniest tug, and he would have then slowly drifted towards her. And I'm thinking they could've written something for that, this slow approach, you know, this sort of - this frustrated sexual tension between them could've been enhanced or explored with this slow drift between the two of them. But no, no, he unclips it and flies away. I mean, we've known the physics of this since Galileo. DAVIES: All right, it sounds like you've got a director's future ahead of you, maybe. TYSON: And not only that, all the debris - by the way, the debris scenario, if there's any listeners that haven't seen the film yet, it describes a scenario where a satellite is destroyed, and the pieces, the fragments of that satellite, then become projectiles that then take out 10 other satellites. And then they break apart and become projectiles and each take out 10 others. So there's an exponential destruction of satellites in orbit. This is a real scenario, by the way, that has been calculated and has people in the business deeply concerned, a catastrophic satellite destruction scenario. So that's real, except it had all the satellites coming at them from east to west, but nearly all satellites orbit the Earth from west to east, for an interesting reason. When you launch, you want to launch in the direction Earth is rotating, so you get a little extra Earth boost, and it requires less fuel to accomplish that. So they didn't think that one through. They just thought just be in space and have these things fly at you. I mean, it wouldn't have taken much to think it through and get that right. I think, people, they didn't do all the homework they could have. DAVIES: We're speaking with. . . TYSON: By the way, I like the film, and they got so much else right. I mean, I had to write a disclaimer. I said, look, I put out 10 tweets, but there's 500 other tweets I could've put out that show what they got right. So chill out, people. DAVIES: We're speaking with Neil DeGrasse Tyson. He hosts the forthcoming series \"Cosmos: A Space-Time Odyssey\" on Fox TV. We'll talk more after a break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR, and if you're just joining us, we're speaking with astrophysicist Neil DeGrasse Tyson. He is the director of the Hayden Planetarium in New York and the host of the forthcoming series \"Cosmos: A Space-Time Odyssey\" on Fox TV. You were among the scientists, if I have this right, responsible for removing Pluto from its place as the ninth planet in the solar system. (LAUGHTER)TYSON: No, I was an accessory to that. DAVIES: OK, an accessory. TYSON: I drove one of the getaway cars, that's all. But yeah, at. . . DAVIES: Which a lot of people had a pretty emotional reaction to. Explain what it's all about. What is Pluto, and why did it arouse such emotion? Yeah. TYSON: Pluto is not only the littlest planet - all right, that alone shouldn't hurt it - but it's made - more than half of its volume is ice. No other planet has that. So if you moved it to where Earth is right now, heat from the sun would evaporate the ice, and it would grow a tail. That's no kind of behavior for a planet. Plus Pluto, its orbit is elongated so severely that it crosses the orbit of Neptune. Now we have words for objects that cross the orbits of other planets and are made of mostly ice. They're called comets. And by the way, there's six moons in the solar system bigger than Pluto, including Earth's moon, which is five times the mass of Pluto. So really Pluto was never the ninth planet. It was the first of a new class of objects that we didn't really discover the rest of until the early 1990s. And we realized that Pluto orbits the sun in a swath of real estate where there are countless thousands of other icy bodies that have similar orbits. And so we learned something new about the solar system. You didn't lose a planet; you gained what we call the Kuiper Belt of Comets, predicted to be there by Gerard Kuiper, an astronomer at mid-20th century, who hypothesized that there would be this leftover repository of frozen objects that never got included in the formation of the planets. So that's the basis for this, and back in New York at the Rose Center for Earth and Space, when we re-opened the facility in 2000, brand new facility, we repositioned Pluto with these other icy bodies, and that pissed people off. There was a Page One headline in the New York Times: Pluto not a planet? Only in New York. So we didn't make it - we were the first to do it publicly, but this was already a debated topic in the field. And like I said, we just drove the getaway car. DAVIES: What are some of the most important questions astronomers are seeking to right now? You mentioned the subject of dark matter or dark energy, which. . . TYSON: Yeah, I can - top four, I've got, I live with these four. OK, so we can measure the influence of this thing we call dark energy, which is forcing an acceleration of the expanding universe. We don't know what that is. We don't know anything about it other than what it's doing to the universe. Then, you know, 85 percent of the gravity of the universe has a point of origin about which we know nothing. We account for all the matter and energy that we're familiar with, measure up how much gravity it should have, it's one-sixth of the gravity that's actually operating on the universe. We call that dark matter. It really should be called dark gravity. We don't know what that is, either. We don't know how we went from, we Earth, went from organic molecules, inanimate organic molecules to self-replicating life. We've got top people working on that, as well. We don't know what was around before the universe. We don't know what is at the center of a black hole. We don't know whether the universe actually is one of many in a multiverse. We want to know is there life thriving in the under-ice oceans of Jupiter's moon Europa, waters kept warm from the stress of Jupiter's gravity. It's a tug-of-war between Jupiter's gravity and that of other surrounding moons, squeezing and pulsing Europa, pumping energy into it, melting the ice, giving us an ocean of liquid water that's been liquid for billions of years. For me these are top questions. But my favorite question is the one that we don't even know to ask yet because it's a question that would arise upon answering these questions I just delivered to you. DAVIES: That's the scientific process. TYSON: Yes, and in fact at some point, as the poet Rainer Maria Rilke noted, you have to - the scientist, above all actually, has to learn to love the questions themselves. And this is what gets people into trouble. They say - they ask me what was around before the big bang, and I say I don't know. They say well, there had to be something. And they say God or - they have - and they have to have an answer. And if you're a scientist, and you have to have an answer, even in the absence of data, you're not going to be a good scientist. DAVIES: We know the phrase SETI, S-E-T-I, which stands for Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence. I mean, there are initiatives to try and figure out whether we can connect with other life forms in the universe. Is this, do you think, a good use of scientific resources? TYSON: Well it started out when we spoke of alien life only thinking of, you know, little green men with antennas. But since then, that search has broadened to consider not just life we might think we'd have a conversation with but any life at all. And this birthed the whole concept of exobiology and astrobiology - is just such a search. And I think that's a healthier search because it allows there to be what we might think of as intelligent life in the search parameters, but more than likely, the first life we find would be microbial. And that would be fine, too. That could transform biology, especially if that life is - has its identity encoded in ways that doesn't even use a DNA molecule because that would be life as we know it if it had DNA. The fun part would be finding life as we don't know it, for starters. Now, if you want to focus on the search for intelligence, there's a whole organization devoted to that, and it's SETI. They work out of I think Mountain View, California, and people who are trying to think about how might we send a signal to an intelligent alien who would then decode it with radio receivers, or how might we receive a signal sent by them. What might that signal look like? And oh yeah, we should put some percentage of money to that. Otherwise what, you know, what are we? What do. . . (LAUGHTER)TYSON: But putting some money to it recognizes that we're probably not alone, and it's a huge universe, and it's a - you're being honest with your research money saying are we the only intelligent species in the universe. If we think that, that's inexcusably hubristic of us given how old the universe is, how prevalent the molecules that are in our body are found across the universe and how many opportunities there are to form life. So yeah, oh by all means, let's look for it. DAVIES: You've served on a couple of presidential commissions and have had some, you know, some input on national science policy. How big of a priority is continued space exploration? I mean, could we get to Mars? TYSON: Yeah, one of my great concerns in the current plans for NASA, as put forth by President Obama, is the - so he gives some great - he always gives a great speech. So in his space speech, which he gave just a few years ago at Kennedy Space Center, by the way, so it was all, you know, and it had the trappings of a real speech that'll get us into the future, he talked about going to Mars and visiting asteroids. And I'd never heard a president talk about asteroids before in their conversation. So this was all quite hopeful. And then you give the applause, and then you stop and say, well, wait a minute, what time frame did he say? Oh, the 2030s. So wait a minute, is he president in the 2030s? No, he's back on the beaches of Hawaii by then. Well, on what budget? Well, the budget is not established for it. So then I thought: What does it mean for a president to promise a future that will be executed by a president to be named later on a budget that is not established? And at that point I was very disappointed because I couldn't see how this would actually become reality. That's me speaking as a scientist who's a space enthusiast. But speaking as just simply an American who cares about the economic health of our country, I see one of the surest ways to bring wealth and prosperity to the country is to innovate in science and technology. And I see space as a frontier, as the greatest STEM driver there ever was, science, technology, engineering and math. This is where dreams are made. This is what rises people out of their seat and say I want to invent that. I want to create the airplane that flies in the rarified atmosphere of Mars. This is what galvanizes a generation to want to become scientists and engineers in the first place, not we need a scientist to develop a plane that's 20 percent more fuel-efficient than the one your parents flew. That might get some people, but that's not the stirring rhetoric that we all remember from the 1960s that made us scientists in the first place. DAVIES: Neil DeGrasse Tyson's series \"Cosmos: A Space-Time Odyssey,\" begins March 9 on Fox TV. He'll be back in the second half of the show. I'm Dave Davies, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies, in for Terry Gross, who's off this week. We're speaking with astrophysicist Neil DeGrasse Tyson. He's director of the Hayden Planetarium at the Museum of Natural History in New York. And this spring, he hosts a new, 13-part TV series, \"Cosmos: A Space-Time Odyssey. \" It begins March 9th on Fox TV, and March 10th on the National Geographic Channel. The programs recall and update the influential series \"Cosmos: A Personal Journey,\" which Carl Sagan hosted on PBS in 1980. Do you see evidence that the scientific efforts in space exploration in the past led to the kind of innovation that had real economic impact - the kind that you describe. . . TYSON: Oh, there's no question about it. Oh-oh, my gosh. And I'm not talking about spinoffs. There's plenty of spinoffs we could all talk about, including safe and affordable Lasik surgery, which derive from the docking algorithms between the space shuttle and the space station, all right. And there's the intracochlear device that enables people who couldn't previously hear to now hear, which tickles the nerve endings of your, in your ear canal. There are - and connects it to your brain. I can go down the list. But that's not even - yes, and that's good. But the real driver here is the stimulation in your culture to become an innovation nation. And when that happens, when we find an asteroid headed our way, what's your first thought? Is it run, or stockpile toilet paper or - no. If that's your first thought, you are not in innovation nation. If you have enough people who are influenced by this way of thinking - the innovative way of thinking - their first thought is: How do we deflect that asteroid? How do we destroy that asteroid? How do we mine that asteroid? That's the kind of thinking that that environment stimulates. Bill Gates and Steve Jobs were 13 and 14 when we landed on the moon. Those are ripe pages to want to invent something new. Just look at that influence from that era. The miniaturization of electronics, which ultimately was driven by the marketplace, was started by NASA, because it costs money to - every extra ounce that you don't need to launch into space, you want to shave, because that costs money and fuel, real money - $10,000 a pound to get something, anything, the extra pound of fat on your belly - into orbit. So you want to trim your electronics, miniaturize your electronics, miniaturize your satellites. The whole push to miniaturize to begin with was NASA. And so no one with a living room radio that was a piece of furniture at the time would say, gee. I want to carry that around on my hip pocket. That was not a thought until NASA initiated this whole exercise. So there's an influence that's not just spinoff. It's how it influences culture, and that's the culture that I don't think that the United States is a part of right now. DAVIES: You're saying that a docking technology led to Lasik surgery. What was the connection there? TYSON: Yeah. So, Lasik surgery is quite old. It's, as you know, it's sort of cutting areas of your eye and have it re-heal in a new shape, so that it precludes the need for corrective lenses. And that procedure was expensive and was at risk of error or failure, because how do you keep the eye steady while you're making cuts? And so there's a docking algorithm that attaches the space station - the space shuttle to the space station, that lines up the docking nodes, and it uses lasers to do this. And that algorithm, when applied to Lasik surgery, allows the cuts to be made even if the eye - as I understand how it works - even if the eye is not exactly stationary for this to happen. So it can move with the eye. And so this will enable it to be faster, cheaper and more effective than any previous attempt to do this. And so I've joked about let's go around and remove everything overnight from your home that was brought about or inspired by space exploration and have you wake up in the absence of it. So you'd wake up with poor vision, among other things. . . (LAUGHTER)TYSON: . . . and you wouldn't have all your miniaturized electronics, and you can just go on down the list. And it's - even simple things, by the way. Do you know there are grooves in the curved exit ramps of many freeways? And that, of course, improves traction when the road is wet. You say, oh, that's a great idea. That came from NASA. It doesn't have to be high-tech to be a great idea. Why did it come from NASA? Because someone was more interested in the space shuttle landing and maintaining its course because it's not - a spaceship shuttle is not powered when it's landing. It's a glider. And you want that thing to sort of not skid off the runway coming in for a landing. So they came up with this grooved idea, which keeps the tires aligned. It channels out the water. And someone thought it up because they were inspired by NASA, not because they're inspired by cars on exit ramps from freeways. So, high-tech and low-tech creativity are stimulated by this kind of activity. DAVIES: We're speaking with Neil Degrasse Tyson, and we'll continue our conversation in just a moment. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, our guest is Neil Degrasse Tyson. He is the director of the Hayden Planetarium in New York. He's an astrophysicists who is also hosting the 13-part series \"Cosmos: A Space-Time Odyssey,\" coming soon on Fox TV. You grew up in New York City. Were you a science nerd as a kid? TYSON: Yeah. I would say so. It depends on how early you start the clock is being a kid, but from age nine, that probably counts. (LAUGHTER)TYSON: A first visit to my local planetarium, which was the Hayden Planetarium. And it took me a couple of years to realize that it was something you could make as a career. But - so, by age 11 onward, that's when I had the answer to that annoying question that adults ask you, like, what do you want to be when you grow up? And I'd say astrophysicist, and that really just shut them up, because they had - there's no comeback on that one. (LAUGHTER)TYSON: It's not like, oh, I know an astrophysicist. No, they don't know any astrophysicists. So, it's a funny kind of little exchange there. But no, I've known since - for that early. So I was a card-carrying nerd child. DAVIES: You were just captivated by that planetarium show? TYSON: Oh, yeah. So I don't think I was more captivated than anybody else's first experience in a planetarium. I think every human with a beating heart remembers their first encounter with a nice guy in a planetarium. The difference for me is I think the universe called me. I don't - I feel like I had no say in the matter, because by the end of that experience, when the lights come out - the lights turn out and it gets dark and the stars reveal themselves, I was hooked ever since. I don't remember consciously saying: This is for me. I think it was just - became part of my bloodstream, if you will. And to a New Yorker, we have no relationship with the night sky. DAVIES: Right. TYSON: If you look up, there's a building there. And you look higher up, there's still a building there. Our buildings are very tall. And back then, there was not only light pollution, as there still is today. Back then, there was also air pollution. Air is much cleaner in New York than ever, since the 19 - early 1900s. So I was struck that such a sky even existed. In fact, I didn't even believe it. I thought it was a little bit of a hoax. I know how many stars there are in the night sky. I've seen them from the Bronx. DAVIES: Right. TYSON: You can't lie to me, but I'll enjoy it anyway, you know. DAVIES: So I know you excelled at this and got involved in some special programs. And I read that you were recently asked to give, I think, a commencement address at, was it your elementary school, and declined. Did you feel let down by the public school system when you were a kid a kid? TYSON: Oh, no, no. So everyone has all different experiences in school. I just know that throughout my life, at no time did any teacher ever point to me and say, hey. He'll go far. Oh, he's someone you should watch. You know, I had some OK grades. They ran the gamut. I had some high grades in math and science, and medium grades in other subjects, and slightly lower grades in other subjects. You've got to remember, the school system is constructed to praise you if you get high grades. And if you get straight A's, you're the one that everyone puts forward, and they prognosticate that the straight-A person is the one most likely to succeed, because that's the way the school system is constructed and conceived. DAVIES: Simple. Yeah. TYSON: And there I am, getting grades all over the place, but I know my interest in the universe and I owned a telescope that I bought with money I earned by walking dogs, because I live in a huge apartment complex. And 50 cents per walk, per dog, and that accumulated quickly. I bought a camera, a telescope. I taught myself astrophotography. I did all this. I took classes at the American Museum of Natural History at Hayden Planetarium, advanced classes for adults in modern astrophysics. I did all this, but none of that showed up as a high grade on an exam in school. So, there I am, and teachers complaining about my social energy, as though that was something bad, and, oh, he's disruptive. Not purposely, I just had energy, right. So my elementary school wanted me to come back - because I was already well-known by then - to talk and say what a great education I had. I said no. That's not the talk I would give. I would say I am where I am today not because of what the teachers said about me or did for me, but in spite of it. And I don't think that's what you want, so I will decline. Invite me back one day, and I'll talk just to the teachers, all right, and then I'm happy to tell - give - you know, tell them what they should be looking for, perhaps, in their students. Also consider - now, see you've got me started here. Also consider that if you a straight-A student in your class, that student has straight A's not because of teachers, but in spite of teachers. That's what having straight-A means. It means you do well, no matter the teaching talent of the teacher. That's what straight A's mean. So if you're a teacher and you put forth your straight-A student as though you had something to do with it, you are deluding yourself. DAVIES: Right. TYSON: The greatest teachers are the ones that turn a B student into an A student, or a failing student into a B student. Then let's talk about your teaching talents. DAVIES: Having done some teaching, I completely agree with what you say there. But I wanted to ask: Were you discouraged from getting into science, or maybe not taken seriously - then and even through college and graduate school - because you were African-American, at times? TYSON: Oh, so the African-American thing. So there you get, oh why are you staying late for the physics club when you have this athletic talent? You could be really great at that. And that happened a lot. So that's not explicitly racist. It's sort of implicitly - it's not like the stories my father could tell you, right, because he grew up in the '30s, '40s and early '50s. Those are - that's a whole other kind of story that he can tell you. So, compared to that and those stories I heard, I wasn't, you know, I wasn't going to complain about this. I just made sure I had a fuel tank ready to draw from to just get over and get past whatever these obstacles or absence of support was there. DAVIES: I know you wrestled, I think, in high school and college. And I also. . . TYSON: Yeah. Captain of my school's wrestling team. Yeah. DAVIES: And I also read that you were a medal-winning Latin ballroom dancer at the University of Texas? TYSON: Yeah. So. . . (LAUGHTER)TYSON: I entered graduate school, but didn't finish graduate school at the University of Texas at Austin. And I was athletic, you know, as society had expected of me, and so I was pretty limber and flexible from having wrestled. And I've always liked the art of dance, and so I was a member of two or three performing dance companies. College troops, they were. One of them was a dance team that was engaged in competitive international Latin ballroom. And I was on a dance team of eight couples, and we would perform. And we were national champion in one year. So that was fun. DAVIES: Is it true that you, at one point, thought about making some money by becoming an exotic male dancer? TYSON: Well. . . (LAUGHTER)TYSON: In graduate school - you're broke in graduate school, basically. And I was flexible from having danced, and I was pretty cut from having wrestled, and I also rowed. And so, on the dance team, there were some fellow male dancers who told me about this club where - it's this ladies club, right, but there's male dancers. And they said they danced, do the moves we do, just in the normal training and for our dance performances. It's in the range of what the flexibility would be for anything else we'd be doing. They invited me, because I needed more money, I was broke. So I went. . . (LAUGHTER)TYSON: . . . just to observe it, right. Say, is this is something I could do? Just - and there they came out with jockstraps having been soaked in lighter fluid, asbestos jockstraps ignited, coming out dancing to Jerry Lee Lewis' \"Great Balls of Fire. \" I said no - not - no. That's not for me. (LAUGHTER)TYSON: And I'm embarrassed to say that it was not until that moment when I said to myself: Maybe I should be a math tutor. (LAUGHTER)TYSON: I don't know why I didn't think of that first. I'm embarrassed by that, because, yeah. I can tutor math, I mean, and physics. And from then on, I tutored math and physics. And that's how I closed my budget. DAVIES: When did you realize you had a gift for communicating with people about science? I mean, you're, you do this in a lot of venues, and have for a long time. TYSON: Yeah. People call it a gift, and that implies you sit there and someone hands it to you. I want to encourage people to not think in terms of gifts, but think in terms of, wow. You work hard to succeed at that, because that's exactly what I do. For an example, before my first interview on Jon Stewart - you know, that's a tough interview right there, all right, because he's brilliant and he's laden with pop culture referencing. And so I said to myself: If I'm going to have a successful interview with Jon Stewart, I want to study how he talks to his guests. So I sat there and I timed how long he lets you speak before he comes in with some kind of wisecrack or a joke. And what's the average time interval of that? Is it a minute, 90 seconds, 30 seconds? And I would create a rhythm in the parceling of the information I would deliver to him so that a complete thought would come out. So that when he does interrupt, there's a complete thought and then a fun joke, and then there's a resonance to that where you can then move on. Yeah. No, it's not a gift. DAVIES: OK. TYSON: I work at it. DAVIES: Oh, OK. OK. (LAUGHTER)DAVIES: Did Stewart notice that you were prepared? TYSON: No. People say, oh, you're such a natural. That's what they say. I guess I'll take that as a compliment. DAVIES: You make it look easy. Right. OK. TYSON: Oh, by the way, this is - this goes back. I mean, you mentioned a race thing earlier. Generally I never talk about race but you did. You remember the comparisons between Michael Jordan and Larry Bird of the Boston Celtics. When they described Larry Bird's very high, obvious talent, they say, well, he's a student of basketball and studies where the ball is and where people - and they talk about Michael Jordan and say, oh, he's just a natural. DAVIES: Gifted athlete. TYSON: There's a denial of, yeah, he's a gifted athlete. Meanwhile, he was not a first round pick out of his college or getting into college. The man worked at it. And so at some point one needs to say, yes, black people who are talented work at what they did to become talented. All right? Oh, it's just genetic. Oh, it's fast twitch muscle. It's low twitch. Shut up. Give me a chance to tell you how hard we work at this stuff. DAVIES: In the epilogue to your book \"Space Chronicles,\" you tell the story of a psychologist who had been to the Hayden Planetarium, you know, where you're the director and had seen this show, \"Passport to the Universe,\" and he, you relate, wanted to do some research on whether it increased depression among people who saw it. And his thinking was it made him feel so small and insignificant to see the vastness of the cosmos. And you say he's really misreading nature. Explain. TYSON: Yeah, exactly. That was our inaugural show for the opening of - reopening of the Hayden Planetarium. As part of the Rose Center for Earth and Space. And that show was written by Ann Druyan and Steve Soter, who are the principal writers of the current \"Cosmos\". DAVIES: Ann Druyan, who's the widow of Carl Sagan. TYSON: Widow of Carl Sagan and a huge talent in her own right and was one of the co-authors with Steve Soter of the original \"Cosmos. \" So we're genetically linked to the original series. And so that original sky show was a zoom out from Earth and Earth just shrinks to nothingness. Our solar system shrinks to nothingness, as does our galaxy. So, yeah. I think if you walked in there with an ego that says I'm large, I'm important and I'm significant, that's going to hurt. This information is going to hurt. And so I think he went in there with the wrong attitude. This is an academic psychologist, by the way, who does research on feelings of insignificance. So this was right up his professional research alley. I claim that if you went in there with no ego at all and then you saw the grandeur of the universe, recognizing that our molecules are traceable to stars that exploded and spread these elements across the galaxy, then you would see the universe as something you participate in, as this great unfolding of a cosmic story. And that, I think, should make you feel large, not small. So I claim he entered the room with the wrong attitude to begin with. DAVIES: So that's. . . TYSON: Any astrophysicist does not feel small looking up at the universe; we feel large. DAVIES: That's the cosmic perspective - you're part of it all. TYSON: That is a cosmic perspective, that's correct. And in tandem with that, you will never find people who truly grasp the cosmic perspective such as the entire community of astrophysicists leading nations into battle. No, that doesn't happen. When you have a cosmic perspective, there's this little speck called Earth and you say you're going to do what? You're on this side of a line in the sand and you want to kill people for what? Oh, to pull oil out of the - what? What? What? And you have this whole universe of resources and perspectives? So not enough people in this world, I think, carry a cosmic perspective with them. It could be life-changing. DAVIES: Well, Neil DeGrasse Tyson, thanks so much for speaking with us. TYSON: Well, thanks for having me. Thanks for having me. DAVIES: Neil DeGrasse Tyson is an astrophysicist and director of the Hayden Planetarium at the Museum of Natural History in New York. His series \"Cosmos: A Space-Time Odyssey,\" begins March 9 on Fox. Coming up, John Powers has an appreciation of writer, director and actor Harold Ramis, who died Monday. This is FRESH AIR. DAVE DAVIES, HOST:  This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies, in for Terry Gross, who's off this week. Our guest, Neil DeGrasse Tyson, is an astrophysicist and director of the Hayden Planetarium at the Museum of Natural History in New York. But that doesn't begin to tell you who he is. Tyson is a prolific writer, having authored many books and essays, and he may be the country's most frequently quoted and interviewed authority on astronomy in the popular media. He's hosted a four-part series on PBS's \"Nova\" and appeared everywhere from \"The Tonight Show\" to \"The Daily Show\" to NPR's WAIT WAIT. . . DON'T TELL ME! This spring he hosts a new 13-part TV series, \"Cosmos: A Space-Time Odyssey. \" It begins March 9 on Fox and March 10 on the National Geographic Channel. The programs recall and update the influential series \"Cosmos: A Personal Journey,\" which Carl Sagan hosted on PBS in 1980. Tyson worked with Ann Druyan, Sagan's widow, in developing the new series. Here's a moment from the first episode, which begins with Carl Sagan and finishes with Tyson. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"COSMOS: A SPACE-TIME ODYSSEY\") CARL SAGAN: The cosmos is all that is or ever was or ever will be. Come with me. NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: A generation ago, the astronomer Carl Sagan stood here and launched hundreds of millions of us on a great adventure: the exploration of the universe revealed by science. It's time to get going again. DAVIES: Well, Neil DeGrasse Tyson, welcome to FRESH AIR. A lot of us who are old enough to have seen the original series remember it dimly, and of course you've been involved in it again. Looking back on it, what struck you about it? What did you want to honor? TYSON: Well, I, at the time, it was 1980 when it first aired, and I was entering graduate school in astrophysics. So \"Cosmos,\" unlike its influence on others, where it may have first awakened them to the glories of the universe or to science, for me I was already sort of a committed student to the subject. So for me its influence was primarily an existence proof that a scientist can communicate with the public in a manner that was very different from professor in front of a classroom or you know, pontificating from up on high. His style was very conversation and fireside chatty, and there he was on the screen, but he was really with you in the living room. And I said to myself, if I'm ever in a position to communicate with the public on such a scale that I would want to do it in that way. DAVIES: I want to play a clip from the first episode, and in this one you're explaining a narrative device that was also used in the original series, the cosmic calendar, which gives us a sense of the scale of the 13. 8 billion years that have passed since the beginning of the universe. Let's listen. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"COSMOS: A SPACE-TIME ODYSSEY\") TYSON: The cosmic calendar begins on January 1 with the birth of our universe. It contains everything that's happened since then, up to now, which on this calendar is midnight December 31. On this scale, every month represents about a billion years. Every day represents nearly 40 million years. Let's go back as far as we can, to the very first moment of the universe, January 1, the big bang. It's as far back as we can see in time, for now. (SOUNDBITE OF EXPLOSION) DAVIES: Kaboom. (LAUGHTER) TYSON: I donned sunglasses for that one. DAVIES: That's from the series \"The Cosmos\" on Fox TV, which will be hosted by our guest Neil DeGrasse Tyson. You know, I played that in part because of that huge boom. We see you actually kind of experiencing the big bang. You know, the blast kind of shakes your clothing and all. TYSON: Yeah, and not getting vaporized, right. We needed special clothing for that. (LAUGHTER) DAVIES: And somehow surviving it. And it kind of raises the question of, you know, the tradeoff between kind of substance and show biz. And I know you've done a lot of popular science education. I suspect this is something that you deal with a lot. Talk a little bit about how you address that issue. TYSON: Well, the very question presumes that one of the two has to be compromised for the both to be successful, and I don't agree with that premise. I think if you have not thought deeply about how to communicate science, you might get stuck saying, OK, I have to dumb this down, or I have to be flashy but with no real content. But if you really think deeply about the visualizations, the effects, the visual effects, and the content, you get to have both. And I don't think I've ever been accused of dumbing anything down. The audience knows it if you're dumbing it down. In the \"Cosmos\" series, I'm speaking real science to you, and the visualizations are supporting that real science. So yeah, the big bang is as far back in time as we can see. These are just facts. And yeah, the cosmic calendar is an awesome way to capture the flow of events in a way that we can kind of understand better, can kind of relate to. On a cosmic calendar, our galaxy, our galaxy forms on March 15. So the universe has been around for a while before we formed. Our solar system forms August 31. You can calculate this out and find out where it fits. These are visualization tools. So yeah, I don't see that as a tradeoff, at all. DAVIES: Right, I didn't mean to suggest that you were compromising the science in doing all that. TYSON: Yes you did. (LAUGHTER) DAVIES: No, I didn't. But what I do suspect is that there are people involved in the production that, you know, without the diligent care might do that, and there are probably times you've got to say not so fast, that isn't quite right. TYSON: Oh yeah, I'm all over him if that happens, and the good thing about the universe in this, the 21st century, we have extraordinary sources of data, the Hubble Telescope and many other telescopes that are just as important but don't have quite the PR machine that the Hubble did, that inform the visualizations that we provide. So there's a limit to the freedom that an artist is given to portray things. You know, if you look at a first-run movie, they just want the thing to look good, whether or not it follows laws of physics. And occasionally I'm on top of them too, after the fact. I commented on the film \"Gravity\". . . DAVIES: I was going to bring that up. Yeah, I think you did this on Twitter. Why don't you share some of the kind of scientific inaccuracies in \"Gravity\". . . TYSON: Well, yeah, so \"Cosmos\" has, as its priority, to get the science right above all else, and we will then tell the story with the properly represented science. In Hollywood, in the dramas that are portrayed, I think they sometimes take some latitudes either out of ignorance or because they feel as though the truth would somehow constrain their flexibility of storytelling. And in the film \"Gravity,\" I saw that pretty early, I mean, maybe day two or something, and I just felt compelled to put out, you know, 10 tweets or so on things I thought they could have gotten right, but they didn't get right. And I phrase them mysteries of \"Gravity,\" one of which was: Why is it that Sandra Bullock, who's portraying a medical doctor, is fixing my Hubble Space Telescope? Get her the hell off my telescope. (LAUGHTER) TYSON: As an astrophysicist, I don't walk into her operating room and say I've got this, open-heart surgery. I'm an astrophysicist. So, little things, they're just little things like that, and I was just having fun. And by the way, I don't spend that much energy commenting on a movie unless I think the movie has deserved it, has earned it in particular. I don't comment on the physics errors of \"Star Wars,\" all right. I just - you let that one go. So the fact that I even did this, for me, was quite a compliment to the film. DAVIES: Give us a couple more examples of science that wasn't quite right there. TYSON: For example, her hair. Her hair should've been sort of floating in zero-G, and it was not. It was like there was heavy mousse or something kept that stuff down. (LAUGHTER) DAVIES: We wouldn't have liked that look. That's the problem there. TYSON: I know, and that's what we - that's the first thing we notice when we see astronauts floating in space, is the hair just sticking up, and it's kind of comical and funny, and it's the great reminder that they're in zero-G. Also this poignant scene where they're at opposite ends of a tether, and George Clooney character says, you know, I'm going to unclip because if you try to come get me, we'll both die, right? So it's this noble, the right stuff kind of move. And then he unclips and then floats away. I'm thinking, no, that's not how physics work. If you are - if the system is not rotating, which it wasn't because Earth was just stationary in the background, and if he unclips, he would just stay there. And all she needed to do was give a tiny little tug, the tiniest tug, and he would have then slowly drifted towards her. And I'm thinking they could've written something for that, this slow approach, you know, this sort of - this frustrated sexual tension between them could've been enhanced or explored with this slow drift between the two of them. But no, no, he unclips it and flies away. I mean, we've known the physics of this since Galileo. DAVIES: All right, it sounds like you've got a director's future ahead of you, maybe. TYSON: And not only that, all the debris - by the way, the debris scenario, if there's any listeners that haven't seen the film yet, it describes a scenario where a satellite is destroyed, and the pieces, the fragments of that satellite, then become projectiles that then take out 10 other satellites. And then they break apart and become projectiles and each take out 10 others. So there's an exponential destruction of satellites in orbit. This is a real scenario, by the way, that has been calculated and has people in the business deeply concerned, a catastrophic satellite destruction scenario. So that's real, except it had all the satellites coming at them from east to west, but nearly all satellites orbit the Earth from west to east, for an interesting reason. When you launch, you want to launch in the direction Earth is rotating, so you get a little extra Earth boost, and it requires less fuel to accomplish that. So they didn't think that one through. They just thought just be in space and have these things fly at you. I mean, it wouldn't have taken much to think it through and get that right. I think, people, they didn't do all the homework they could have. DAVIES: We're speaking with. . . TYSON: By the way, I like the film, and they got so much else right. I mean, I had to write a disclaimer. I said, look, I put out 10 tweets, but there's 500 other tweets I could've put out that show what they got right. So chill out, people. DAVIES: We're speaking with Neil DeGrasse Tyson. He hosts the forthcoming series \"Cosmos: A Space-Time Odyssey\" on Fox TV. We'll talk more after a break. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR, and if you're just joining us, we're speaking with astrophysicist Neil DeGrasse Tyson. He is the director of the Hayden Planetarium in New York and the host of the forthcoming series \"Cosmos: A Space-Time Odyssey\" on Fox TV. You were among the scientists, if I have this right, responsible for removing Pluto from its place as the ninth planet in the solar system. (LAUGHTER) TYSON: No, I was an accessory to that. DAVIES: OK, an accessory. TYSON: I drove one of the getaway cars, that's all. But yeah, at. . . DAVIES: Which a lot of people had a pretty emotional reaction to. Explain what it's all about. What is Pluto, and why did it arouse such emotion? Yeah. TYSON: Pluto is not only the littlest planet - all right, that alone shouldn't hurt it - but it's made - more than half of its volume is ice. No other planet has that. So if you moved it to where Earth is right now, heat from the sun would evaporate the ice, and it would grow a tail. That's no kind of behavior for a planet. Plus Pluto, its orbit is elongated so severely that it crosses the orbit of Neptune. Now we have words for objects that cross the orbits of other planets and are made of mostly ice. They're called comets. And by the way, there's six moons in the solar system bigger than Pluto, including Earth's moon, which is five times the mass of Pluto. So really Pluto was never the ninth planet. It was the first of a new class of objects that we didn't really discover the rest of until the early 1990s. And we realized that Pluto orbits the sun in a swath of real estate where there are countless thousands of other icy bodies that have similar orbits. And so we learned something new about the solar system. You didn't lose a planet; you gained what we call the Kuiper Belt of Comets, predicted to be there by Gerard Kuiper, an astronomer at mid-20th century, who hypothesized that there would be this leftover repository of frozen objects that never got included in the formation of the planets. So that's the basis for this, and back in New York at the Rose Center for Earth and Space, when we re-opened the facility in 2000, brand new facility, we repositioned Pluto with these other icy bodies, and that pissed people off. There was a Page One headline in the New York Times: Pluto not a planet? Only in New York. So we didn't make it - we were the first to do it publicly, but this was already a debated topic in the field. And like I said, we just drove the getaway car. DAVIES: What are some of the most important questions astronomers are seeking to right now? You mentioned the subject of dark matter or dark energy, which. . . TYSON: Yeah, I can - top four, I've got, I live with these four. OK, so we can measure the influence of this thing we call dark energy, which is forcing an acceleration of the expanding universe. We don't know what that is. We don't know anything about it other than what it's doing to the universe. Then, you know, 85 percent of the gravity of the universe has a point of origin about which we know nothing. We account for all the matter and energy that we're familiar with, measure up how much gravity it should have, it's one-sixth of the gravity that's actually operating on the universe. We call that dark matter. It really should be called dark gravity. We don't know what that is, either. We don't know how we went from, we Earth, went from organic molecules, inanimate organic molecules to self-replicating life. We've got top people working on that, as well. We don't know what was around before the universe. We don't know what is at the center of a black hole. We don't know whether the universe actually is one of many in a multiverse. We want to know is there life thriving in the under-ice oceans of Jupiter's moon Europa, waters kept warm from the stress of Jupiter's gravity. It's a tug-of-war between Jupiter's gravity and that of other surrounding moons, squeezing and pulsing Europa, pumping energy into it, melting the ice, giving us an ocean of liquid water that's been liquid for billions of years. For me these are top questions. But my favorite question is the one that we don't even know to ask yet because it's a question that would arise upon answering these questions I just delivered to you. DAVIES: That's the scientific process. TYSON: Yes, and in fact at some point, as the poet Rainer Maria Rilke noted, you have to - the scientist, above all actually, has to learn to love the questions themselves. And this is what gets people into trouble. They say - they ask me what was around before the big bang, and I say I don't know. They say well, there had to be something. And they say God or - they have - and they have to have an answer. And if you're a scientist, and you have to have an answer, even in the absence of data, you're not going to be a good scientist. DAVIES: We know the phrase SETI, S-E-T-I, which stands for Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence. I mean, there are initiatives to try and figure out whether we can connect with other life forms in the universe. Is this, do you think, a good use of scientific resources? TYSON: Well it started out when we spoke of alien life only thinking of, you know, little green men with antennas. But since then, that search has broadened to consider not just life we might think we'd have a conversation with but any life at all. And this birthed the whole concept of exobiology and astrobiology - is just such a search. And I think that's a healthier search because it allows there to be what we might think of as intelligent life in the search parameters, but more than likely, the first life we find would be microbial. And that would be fine, too. That could transform biology, especially if that life is - has its identity encoded in ways that doesn't even use a DNA molecule because that would be life as we know it if it had DNA. The fun part would be finding life as we don't know it, for starters. Now, if you want to focus on the search for intelligence, there's a whole organization devoted to that, and it's SETI. They work out of I think Mountain View, California, and people who are trying to think about how might we send a signal to an intelligent alien who would then decode it with radio receivers, or how might we receive a signal sent by them. What might that signal look like? And oh yeah, we should put some percentage of money to that. Otherwise what, you know, what are we? What do. . . (LAUGHTER) TYSON: But putting some money to it recognizes that we're probably not alone, and it's a huge universe, and it's a - you're being honest with your research money saying are we the only intelligent species in the universe. If we think that, that's inexcusably hubristic of us given how old the universe is, how prevalent the molecules that are in our body are found across the universe and how many opportunities there are to form life. So yeah, oh by all means, let's look for it. DAVIES: You've served on a couple of presidential commissions and have had some, you know, some input on national science policy. How big of a priority is continued space exploration? I mean, could we get to Mars? TYSON: Yeah, one of my great concerns in the current plans for NASA, as put forth by President Obama, is the - so he gives some great - he always gives a great speech. So in his space speech, which he gave just a few years ago at Kennedy Space Center, by the way, so it was all, you know, and it had the trappings of a real speech that'll get us into the future, he talked about going to Mars and visiting asteroids. And I'd never heard a president talk about asteroids before in their conversation. So this was all quite hopeful. And then you give the applause, and then you stop and say, well, wait a minute, what time frame did he say? Oh, the 2030s. So wait a minute, is he president in the 2030s? No, he's back on the beaches of Hawaii by then. Well, on what budget? Well, the budget is not established for it. So then I thought: What does it mean for a president to promise a future that will be executed by a president to be named later on a budget that is not established? And at that point I was very disappointed because I couldn't see how this would actually become reality. That's me speaking as a scientist who's a space enthusiast. But speaking as just simply an American who cares about the economic health of our country, I see one of the surest ways to bring wealth and prosperity to the country is to innovate in science and technology. And I see space as a frontier, as the greatest STEM driver there ever was, science, technology, engineering and math. This is where dreams are made. This is what rises people out of their seat and say I want to invent that. I want to create the airplane that flies in the rarified atmosphere of Mars. This is what galvanizes a generation to want to become scientists and engineers in the first place, not we need a scientist to develop a plane that's 20 percent more fuel-efficient than the one your parents flew. That might get some people, but that's not the stirring rhetoric that we all remember from the 1960s that made us scientists in the first place. DAVIES: Neil DeGrasse Tyson's series \"Cosmos: A Space-Time Odyssey,\" begins March 9 on Fox TV. He'll be back in the second half of the show. I'm Dave Davies, and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies, in for Terry Gross, who's off this week. We're speaking with astrophysicist Neil DeGrasse Tyson. He's director of the Hayden Planetarium at the Museum of Natural History in New York. And this spring, he hosts a new, 13-part TV series, \"Cosmos: A Space-Time Odyssey. \" It begins March 9th on Fox TV, and March 10th on the National Geographic Channel. The programs recall and update the influential series \"Cosmos: A Personal Journey,\" which Carl Sagan hosted on PBS in 1980. Do you see evidence that the scientific efforts in space exploration in the past led to the kind of innovation that had real economic impact - the kind that you describe. . . TYSON: Oh, there's no question about it. Oh-oh, my gosh. And I'm not talking about spinoffs. There's plenty of spinoffs we could all talk about, including safe and affordable Lasik surgery, which derive from the docking algorithms between the space shuttle and the space station, all right. And there's the intracochlear device that enables people who couldn't previously hear to now hear, which tickles the nerve endings of your, in your ear canal. There are - and connects it to your brain. I can go down the list. But that's not even - yes, and that's good. But the real driver here is the stimulation in your culture to become an innovation nation. And when that happens, when we find an asteroid headed our way, what's your first thought? Is it run, or stockpile toilet paper or - no. If that's your first thought, you are not in innovation nation. If you have enough people who are influenced by this way of thinking - the innovative way of thinking - their first thought is: How do we deflect that asteroid? How do we destroy that asteroid? How do we mine that asteroid? That's the kind of thinking that that environment stimulates. Bill Gates and Steve Jobs were 13 and 14 when we landed on the moon. Those are ripe pages to want to invent something new. Just look at that influence from that era. The miniaturization of electronics, which ultimately was driven by the marketplace, was started by NASA, because it costs money to - every extra ounce that you don't need to launch into space, you want to shave, because that costs money and fuel, real money - $10,000 a pound to get something, anything, the extra pound of fat on your belly - into orbit. So you want to trim your electronics, miniaturize your electronics, miniaturize your satellites. The whole push to miniaturize to begin with was NASA. And so no one with a living room radio that was a piece of furniture at the time would say, gee. I want to carry that around on my hip pocket. That was not a thought until NASA initiated this whole exercise. So there's an influence that's not just spinoff. It's how it influences culture, and that's the culture that I don't think that the United States is a part of right now. DAVIES: You're saying that a docking technology led to Lasik surgery. What was the connection there? TYSON: Yeah. So, Lasik surgery is quite old. It's, as you know, it's sort of cutting areas of your eye and have it re-heal in a new shape, so that it precludes the need for corrective lenses. And that procedure was expensive and was at risk of error or failure, because how do you keep the eye steady while you're making cuts? And so there's a docking algorithm that attaches the space station - the space shuttle to the space station, that lines up the docking nodes, and it uses lasers to do this. And that algorithm, when applied to Lasik surgery, allows the cuts to be made even if the eye - as I understand how it works - even if the eye is not exactly stationary for this to happen. So it can move with the eye. And so this will enable it to be faster, cheaper and more effective than any previous attempt to do this. And so I've joked about let's go around and remove everything overnight from your home that was brought about or inspired by space exploration and have you wake up in the absence of it. So you'd wake up with poor vision, among other things. . . (LAUGHTER) TYSON: . . . and you wouldn't have all your miniaturized electronics, and you can just go on down the list. And it's - even simple things, by the way. Do you know there are grooves in the curved exit ramps of many freeways? And that, of course, improves traction when the road is wet. You say, oh, that's a great idea. That came from NASA. It doesn't have to be high-tech to be a great idea. Why did it come from NASA? Because someone was more interested in the space shuttle landing and maintaining its course because it's not - a spaceship shuttle is not powered when it's landing. It's a glider. And you want that thing to sort of not skid off the runway coming in for a landing. So they came up with this grooved idea, which keeps the tires aligned. It channels out the water. And someone thought it up because they were inspired by NASA, not because they're inspired by cars on exit ramps from freeways. So, high-tech and low-tech creativity are stimulated by this kind of activity. DAVIES: We're speaking with Neil Degrasse Tyson, and we'll continue our conversation in just a moment. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, our guest is Neil Degrasse Tyson. He is the director of the Hayden Planetarium in New York. He's an astrophysicists who is also hosting the 13-part series \"Cosmos: A Space-Time Odyssey,\" coming soon on Fox TV. You grew up in New York City. Were you a science nerd as a kid? TYSON: Yeah. I would say so. It depends on how early you start the clock is being a kid, but from age nine, that probably counts. (LAUGHTER) TYSON: A first visit to my local planetarium, which was the Hayden Planetarium. And it took me a couple of years to realize that it was something you could make as a career. But - so, by age 11 onward, that's when I had the answer to that annoying question that adults ask you, like, what do you want to be when you grow up? And I'd say astrophysicist, and that really just shut them up, because they had - there's no comeback on that one. (LAUGHTER) TYSON: It's not like, oh, I know an astrophysicist. No, they don't know any astrophysicists. So, it's a funny kind of little exchange there. But no, I've known since - for that early. So I was a card-carrying nerd child. DAVIES: You were just captivated by that planetarium show? TYSON: Oh, yeah. So I don't think I was more captivated than anybody else's first experience in a planetarium. I think every human with a beating heart remembers their first encounter with a nice guy in a planetarium. The difference for me is I think the universe called me. I don't - I feel like I had no say in the matter, because by the end of that experience, when the lights come out - the lights turn out and it gets dark and the stars reveal themselves, I was hooked ever since. I don't remember consciously saying: This is for me. I think it was just - became part of my bloodstream, if you will. And to a New Yorker, we have no relationship with the night sky. DAVIES: Right. TYSON: If you look up, there's a building there. And you look higher up, there's still a building there. Our buildings are very tall. And back then, there was not only light pollution, as there still is today. Back then, there was also air pollution. Air is much cleaner in New York than ever, since the 19 - early 1900s. So I was struck that such a sky even existed. In fact, I didn't even believe it. I thought it was a little bit of a hoax. I know how many stars there are in the night sky. I've seen them from the Bronx. DAVIES: Right. TYSON: You can't lie to me, but I'll enjoy it anyway, you know. DAVIES: So I know you excelled at this and got involved in some special programs. And I read that you were recently asked to give, I think, a commencement address at, was it your elementary school, and declined. Did you feel let down by the public school system when you were a kid a kid? TYSON: Oh, no, no. So everyone has all different experiences in school. I just know that throughout my life, at no time did any teacher ever point to me and say, hey. He'll go far. Oh, he's someone you should watch. You know, I had some OK grades. They ran the gamut. I had some high grades in math and science, and medium grades in other subjects, and slightly lower grades in other subjects. You've got to remember, the school system is constructed to praise you if you get high grades. And if you get straight A's, you're the one that everyone puts forward, and they prognosticate that the straight-A person is the one most likely to succeed, because that's the way the school system is constructed and conceived. DAVIES: Simple. Yeah. TYSON: And there I am, getting grades all over the place, but I know my interest in the universe and I owned a telescope that I bought with money I earned by walking dogs, because I live in a huge apartment complex. And 50 cents per walk, per dog, and that accumulated quickly. I bought a camera, a telescope. I taught myself astrophotography. I did all this. I took classes at the American Museum of Natural History at Hayden Planetarium, advanced classes for adults in modern astrophysics. I did all this, but none of that showed up as a high grade on an exam in school. So, there I am, and teachers complaining about my social energy, as though that was something bad, and, oh, he's disruptive. Not purposely, I just had energy, right. So my elementary school wanted me to come back - because I was already well-known by then - to talk and say what a great education I had. I said no. That's not the talk I would give. I would say I am where I am today not because of what the teachers said about me or did for me, but in spite of it. And I don't think that's what you want, so I will decline. Invite me back one day, and I'll talk just to the teachers, all right, and then I'm happy to tell - give - you know, tell them what they should be looking for, perhaps, in their students. Also consider - now, see you've got me started here. Also consider that if you a straight-A student in your class, that student has straight A's not because of teachers, but in spite of teachers. That's what having straight-A means. It means you do well, no matter the teaching talent of the teacher. That's what straight A's mean. So if you're a teacher and you put forth your straight-A student as though you had something to do with it, you are deluding yourself. DAVIES: Right. TYSON: The greatest teachers are the ones that turn a B student into an A student, or a failing student into a B student. Then let's talk about your teaching talents. DAVIES: Having done some teaching, I completely agree with what you say there. But I wanted to ask: Were you discouraged from getting into science, or maybe not taken seriously - then and even through college and graduate school - because you were African-American, at times? TYSON: Oh, so the African-American thing. So there you get, oh why are you staying late for the physics club when you have this athletic talent? You could be really great at that. And that happened a lot. So that's not explicitly racist. It's sort of implicitly - it's not like the stories my father could tell you, right, because he grew up in the '30s, '40s and early '50s. Those are - that's a whole other kind of story that he can tell you. So, compared to that and those stories I heard, I wasn't, you know, I wasn't going to complain about this. I just made sure I had a fuel tank ready to draw from to just get over and get past whatever these obstacles or absence of support was there. DAVIES: I know you wrestled, I think, in high school and college. And I also. . . TYSON: Yeah. Captain of my school's wrestling team. Yeah. DAVIES: And I also read that you were a medal-winning Latin ballroom dancer at the University of Texas? TYSON: Yeah. So. . . (LAUGHTER) TYSON: I entered graduate school, but didn't finish graduate school at the University of Texas at Austin. And I was athletic, you know, as society had expected of me, and so I was pretty limber and flexible from having wrestled. And I've always liked the art of dance, and so I was a member of two or three performing dance companies. College troops, they were. One of them was a dance team that was engaged in competitive international Latin ballroom. And I was on a dance team of eight couples, and we would perform. And we were national champion in one year. So that was fun. DAVIES: Is it true that you, at one point, thought about making some money by becoming an exotic male dancer? TYSON: Well. . . (LAUGHTER) TYSON: In graduate school - you're broke in graduate school, basically. And I was flexible from having danced, and I was pretty cut from having wrestled, and I also rowed. And so, on the dance team, there were some fellow male dancers who told me about this club where - it's this ladies club, right, but there's male dancers. And they said they danced, do the moves we do, just in the normal training and for our dance performances. It's in the range of what the flexibility would be for anything else we'd be doing. They invited me, because I needed more money, I was broke. So I went. . . (LAUGHTER) TYSON: . . . just to observe it, right. Say, is this is something I could do? Just - and there they came out with jockstraps having been soaked in lighter fluid, asbestos jockstraps ignited, coming out dancing to Jerry Lee Lewis' \"Great Balls of Fire. \" I said no - not - no. That's not for me. (LAUGHTER) TYSON: And I'm embarrassed to say that it was not until that moment when I said to myself: Maybe I should be a math tutor. (LAUGHTER) TYSON: I don't know why I didn't think of that first. I'm embarrassed by that, because, yeah. I can tutor math, I mean, and physics. And from then on, I tutored math and physics. And that's how I closed my budget. DAVIES: When did you realize you had a gift for communicating with people about science? I mean, you're, you do this in a lot of venues, and have for a long time. TYSON: Yeah. People call it a gift, and that implies you sit there and someone hands it to you. I want to encourage people to not think in terms of gifts, but think in terms of, wow. You work hard to succeed at that, because that's exactly what I do. For an example, before my first interview on Jon Stewart - you know, that's a tough interview right there, all right, because he's brilliant and he's laden with pop culture referencing. And so I said to myself: If I'm going to have a successful interview with Jon Stewart, I want to study how he talks to his guests. So I sat there and I timed how long he lets you speak before he comes in with some kind of wisecrack or a joke. And what's the average time interval of that? Is it a minute, 90 seconds, 30 seconds? And I would create a rhythm in the parceling of the information I would deliver to him so that a complete thought would come out. So that when he does interrupt, there's a complete thought and then a fun joke, and then there's a resonance to that where you can then move on. Yeah. No, it's not a gift. DAVIES: OK. TYSON: I work at it. DAVIES: Oh, OK. OK. (LAUGHTER) DAVIES: Did Stewart notice that you were prepared? TYSON: No. People say, oh, you're such a natural. That's what they say. I guess I'll take that as a compliment. DAVIES: You make it look easy. Right. OK. TYSON: Oh, by the way, this is - this goes back. I mean, you mentioned a race thing earlier. Generally I never talk about race but you did. You remember the comparisons between Michael Jordan and Larry Bird of the Boston Celtics. When they described Larry Bird's very high, obvious talent, they say, well, he's a student of basketball and studies where the ball is and where people - and they talk about Michael Jordan and say, oh, he's just a natural. DAVIES: Gifted athlete. TYSON: There's a denial of, yeah, he's a gifted athlete. Meanwhile, he was not a first round pick out of his college or getting into college. The man worked at it. And so at some point one needs to say, yes, black people who are talented work at what they did to become talented. All right? Oh, it's just genetic. Oh, it's fast twitch muscle. It's low twitch. Shut up. Give me a chance to tell you how hard we work at this stuff. DAVIES: In the epilogue to your book \"Space Chronicles,\" you tell the story of a psychologist who had been to the Hayden Planetarium, you know, where you're the director and had seen this show, \"Passport to the Universe,\" and he, you relate, wanted to do some research on whether it increased depression among people who saw it. And his thinking was it made him feel so small and insignificant to see the vastness of the cosmos. And you say he's really misreading nature. Explain. TYSON: Yeah, exactly. That was our inaugural show for the opening of - reopening of the Hayden Planetarium. As part of the Rose Center for Earth and Space. And that show was written by Ann Druyan and Steve Soter, who are the principal writers of the current \"Cosmos\". DAVIES: Ann Druyan, who's the widow of Carl Sagan. TYSON: Widow of Carl Sagan and a huge talent in her own right and was one of the co-authors with Steve Soter of the original \"Cosmos. \" So we're genetically linked to the original series. And so that original sky show was a zoom out from Earth and Earth just shrinks to nothingness. Our solar system shrinks to nothingness, as does our galaxy. So, yeah. I think if you walked in there with an ego that says I'm large, I'm important and I'm significant, that's going to hurt. This information is going to hurt. And so I think he went in there with the wrong attitude. This is an academic psychologist, by the way, who does research on feelings of insignificance. So this was right up his professional research alley. I claim that if you went in there with no ego at all and then you saw the grandeur of the universe, recognizing that our molecules are traceable to stars that exploded and spread these elements across the galaxy, then you would see the universe as something you participate in, as this great unfolding of a cosmic story. And that, I think, should make you feel large, not small. So I claim he entered the room with the wrong attitude to begin with. DAVIES: So that's. . . TYSON: Any astrophysicist does not feel small looking up at the universe; we feel large. DAVIES: That's the cosmic perspective - you're part of it all. TYSON: That is a cosmic perspective, that's correct. And in tandem with that, you will never find people who truly grasp the cosmic perspective such as the entire community of astrophysicists leading nations into battle. No, that doesn't happen. When you have a cosmic perspective, there's this little speck called Earth and you say you're going to do what? You're on this side of a line in the sand and you want to kill people for what? Oh, to pull oil out of the - what? What? What? And you have this whole universe of resources and perspectives? So not enough people in this world, I think, carry a cosmic perspective with them. It could be life-changing. DAVIES: Well, Neil DeGrasse Tyson, thanks so much for speaking with us. TYSON: Well, thanks for having me. Thanks for having me. DAVIES: Neil DeGrasse Tyson is an astrophysicist and director of the Hayden Planetarium at the Museum of Natural History in New York. His series \"Cosmos: A Space-Time Odyssey,\" begins March 9 on Fox. Coming up, John Powers has an appreciation of writer, director and actor Harold Ramis, who died Monday.

I'm Audie Cornish. On the outskirts of Albuquerque, New Mexico, scientists are doing something astonishing. They're creating a white dwarf star - not a whole star but enough of one to study in minute detail. As part of his series, \"Joe's Big Idea,\" NPR's Joe Palca introduces us to the astronomer behind this exotic project and explains why he's determined to learn all he can about this interesting stellar object. JOE PALCA, BYLINE: To understand what drives Don Winget's fascination with white dwarf stars, it helps to go to his ranch in Liberty Hill, Texas. This is where Winget indulges one of his passions, horses. He trains them and he's good at it. He's studied with chief riders from the Spanish Riding School in Vienna. And if you let him, he'll talk your ear off about the fine points of riding. He watches intently as his daughter rides one of his horses in the paddock. DON WINGET: Oh. Canter-walk is very difficult. PALCA: Winget lives for those exquisite moments when a horse does a move exactly right. And the more of those moments, the better. WINGET: Once a week, maybe, will be a really amazing moment. Maybe once a day, if you do it right and you're lucky. And it's an addiction. You do it once and you're so high, you want to do it again. PALCA: Horses are one source of the high Winget craves. Another is astronomy. He's hooked on the feeling that comes with discovering something new about the nature of stars. WINGET: You get to know something about the universe no human being that's ever lived before has ever known. That's profound. PALCA: These days, to feed his addiction, Winget's been traveling from his home base at the University of Texas at Austin to New Mexico, not to observe stars through a telescope but to study them with something called the Z machine. The Z machine is a pulsed-power generator. It works by concentrating millions of volts of electricity and then releasing them all at once in a single shot. Joel Lash is senior manager of the Z machine at the Sandia National Laboratories. I asked him if you could think of the Z machine as an extremely powerful spark generator. JOEL LASH: Yeah, that's a great way to think about it. What pulse power does is compress electrical energy in both time and space. PALCA: And when you release that energy, you create extreme heat, although only for a few hundred billionths of a second. Today, the Z machine will be used to heat a small vial of hydrogen atoms to the temperatures they'd reach at the surface of a white dwarf star. Before he started using the Z machine, Winget would study the physics of these stars with data from telescopes. But a few years ago, a colleague told him about the extreme heat the Z machine could produce and he realized it was essentially making a tiny star. WINGET: Holy crap, Batman. That's a white dwarf star. It looks just like one. Can we really do that? And the answer is yes, we can. And that's what we're doing. PALCA: Winget says the Z machine is changing astrophysics. Instead of just watching stars, he can actually make different kinds of white dwarf stars and see what that does to the way they behave. It's nearing the time for today's shot. Winget's sample of hydrogen atoms is sitting in the center of the Z machine, waiting to get zapped. The shot is a pretty dramatic event. I'm told I'll feel the whole building shake when it fires. Winget says the best place to watch is at a doorway down the hall from the control room. (SOUNDBITE OF HIGH-PITCHED TONE)PALCA: It's a fine spot, except for one thing - an annoying, high-pitched whine. And since it's so annoying, I asked NPR's outstanding audio engineers to digitally remove it. That's much better. A walkie-talkie crackles to life. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Charge complete. Arming to fire. PALCA: It's show time. Winget has some last-minute advice. Don't blink. (SOUNDBITE OF EXPLOSION)WINGET: Yeah. PALCA: All right. WINGET: Yeah. Another great shot. PALCA: Winget can't wait to race off and see the data generated by today's shot. I know a lot of scientists and inventors will recognize just how he feels. WINGET: I want to understand. I want to think about things. I want to solve problems and understand things that nobody who's ever lived before has ever understood. That's what drives me. PALCA: Joe Palca, NPR News.

I'm Melissa Block. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: And I'm Audie Cornish. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel has ordered the Pentagon to revamp its procedures for finding and identifying the bodies of lost service members. That's tens of thousands of Americans who died in World War II, Korea or Vietnam, but whose bodies were never returned. Hagel ordered a team to examine the agencies that handle that mission. And this next report is about what that team will find. For months NPR has investigated the process in partnership with the independent news organization ProPublica. NPR's Kelly McEvers found the agencies to be slow and inefficient and using methods that many scientists say are outdated. KELLY MCEVERS, BYLINE: To understand how these agencies work we focused on the lead agency, the Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command, otherwise known as JPAC. It's housed in a collection of ten low-slung buildings on a U. S. military base in Hawaii. JPAC's mission is this: find, identify and return servicemen whose bodies never made it home from war. And sometimes their process is straight forward. First, says supervising anthropologist Denise To, a team of scientists travels to a site to look for remains. A jungle in Vietnam or Cambodia, a battlefield in Korea or. . . DENISE TO: . . . a beautiful area in Belgium, absolutely stunning rolling green hills. But there's war going on and a plane crash there. And a lot of individuals lost their lives there. MCEVERS: Then whatever's found at the site is brought back to JPAC. The non-biological stuff comes to this lab. Pieces of watches. Is that a lighter? That looks like some kind of jewel piece, piece of a bracelet, another buckle. The biological stuff, the actual remains of the soldier go to the main lab downstairs. So this is the main JPAC lab. And just to describe it what we're looking at is basically just like a series of tables, one, two - what, 15 tables, yeah? And what's laying out on each table are remains, mostly bones. Some of them look to me, a layperson, like almost a complete skeleton. Others, this one that's right in front of us, it's fragments, pieces. In some places almost like dust. We walk up to one of the tables. Forensic anthropologist Marin Pilloud is getting to work on a case. So you're opening a box. MARIN PILLOUD: Yes. This is a mummified foot. These were found in ice, so they're pretty well preserved. MCEVERS: The case is a plane crash from the time of the Korean War. The remains of 19 servicemen were found in a glacier. PILLOUD: Actually I have several guys in soft tissue just over there. MCEVERS: This is one of the straightforward cases. The serial number on the plane led JPAC to a roster of who was on it. Still, Pilloud says it's taken her a year and a half just to sort the remains, test them for DNA and get those test results back. PILLOUD: So right now they're separated by bones that I was able to refit back together. And then these tags all represent different DNA samples. MCEVERS: It gets even more complicated if it's something like a jungle battlefield in the South Pacific where hundreds of marines might've died on one beach. Tom Holland is the director of the main lab at JPAC. He personally signs off on every identification. He describes the process as a funnel. First, you make a list of all the people who could've been on that beach. Then, you narrow it down. TOM HOLLAND: It may be 100 people, 200 people, 500 people. That's fine. That's how you start the process. But then you use artifacts, you use the archaeological analysis, you use the anthropology, you use the DNA. And the idea is that you get down to one individual. MCEVERS: The thing is, JPAC ID'd 60 people last year, even though Congress has mandated them to start ID'ing 200 each year by 2015. We calculated the U. S. spends $1. 3 million on average for every ID. Critics say that's just too slow and too costly. So what's the problem? NPR and ProPublica spent the last five months exploring that question from the lab in Hawaii to battlefields in the Philippines to the halls of the Pentagon to frustrated families in Texas, Illinois and Maine. What we found was a disjointed system handled by a jumble of disconnected federal agencies, memos on a single subject that went back and forth for years, straightforward lab tests that took months to complete and scientists who use an outdated approach that other missing persons labs abandoned decades ago. So let's go back to that funnel again, that narrowing-down process lab director Tom Holland described. HOLLAND: It may be 100 people, 200 people, 500 people. That's fine. The idea is that you get down to one individual. MCEVERS: Our reporting found JPAC uses historical records and forensic anthropology, basically measuring bones and creating biological profiles, to narrow it down. Then they use DNA to confirm their findings. That puts JPAC at odds with prominent missing persons labs around the world. They use a DNA-lead system that works like this. ED HUFFINE: You DNA test all the bodies, you DNA test all the family references. And DNA says this particular body is a member of this family. MCEVERS: That's biochemist Ed Huffine. He used to work at the Army's DNA lab. In 1999 he went to Tuzla, Bosnia, to help identify 4,000 sets of remains that had been found in dozens of mass graves after the Srebrenica Massacre four years before. He found they were using the classic anthropology approach, measuring bones and teeth, trying to match them against records. HUFFINE: Only seven out of more than 4,000 had been able to be identified. MCEVERS: So Huffine and others developed the DNA-led method. That means they took the DNA of the missing and put it in a database, then went to the families of the missing and put their DNA in another database. Then they compared the two databases until they found matches. HUFFINE: I would go to family meetings and explain, here's what DNA can do. Here's how it can potentially identify missing loved ones. MCEVERS: Families gave samples. The number of matches skyrocketed. HUFFINE: Within a several-year period, Bosnia was making more than 400 IDs per month from the DNA-led system. MCEVERS: As of today, 85 percent of the victims have been matched to their relatives by DNA. And some of the remains have been returned. Now the DNA-led approach is a technique that's routinely used by scientists who are looking to identify remains, the FBI, Argentinean and Guatemalan scientists working to ID victims of the so-called dirty wars, and authorities after 9/11 and Hurricane Katrina. One of the last holdouts? JPAC. They still use the classic method. JPAC says that's because it's different with American servicemen. First, JPAC won't just match a leg bone to a relative and call it an ID. They want to return as complete a set of remains as possible. And, says JPAC lab director Tom Holland, you can't just go digging unknown soldiers up from cemeteries unless you know you're going to get it right. HOLLAND: If I start exhuming large numbers that I can't identify, at some point somebody in Washington is going to look at this and say, they're now only identifying half of what they're exhuming. MCEVERS: Digging up American remains only to store them in a lab, he says, is considered disrespectful by most military officials in Washington. HOLLAND: We are talking about war dead. We are talking about men who this country sent in harm's way. And they're owed a modicum of respect. MCEVERS: Holland is so concerned with getting it right, he only approves 4 percent of the requests to dig up remains. In nearly two decades as JPAC's lab director, Holland has never had an individual ID overturned. Still, former JPAC employees told us this aversion to risk is one main reason JPAC makes so few IDs each year. One way to build a faster DNA-led process, several scientists told us, would be to house JPAC's DNA work in one place, or at least under one chain of command. As it stands now, our reporting found the DNA work is done at six different agencies, in Hawaii, Delaware, Kentucky, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia. Congress first started noticing the problems at JPAC and at sister agencies last summer. The government office of accountability found what it called leadership weaknesses and a messy bureaucracy. SENATOR CLAIRE MCCASKILL: We are here today to review the Department of Defense's management of POW/MIA accounting. MCEVERS: At this hearing on Capitol Hill last summer, Senator Claire McCaskill, a Democrat from Missouri, held up a jumbled confusing looking organizational chart of all of the branches of all the different agencies tasked with recovering servicemen who died in past wars. MCCASKILL: Look at that. I mean, is it any wonder that this is a mess? MCEVERS: Even the acronyms and names are seemingly endless: JPAC, DPMO, AFDIL, LESL, Army Casualty, Navy Casualty, Air Force Casualty, Marines Casualty, many of them falling under different parts of the Pentagon. JPAC officials told us each layer of bureaucracy is necessary, that they take the utmost care with every case. They say returning soldiers who died in past wars is what defines us as a nation. In an interview, Senator McCaskill said that sentiment is not enough. MCCASKILL: This is a subject matter that everyone is so warm to. It's a cause that everyone believes in so deeply that I think people have not asked the tough questions or provided the kind of oversight that this effort really demands. So for 20 years, there has been dysfunction, disarray and that's what we're trying to get to the bottom of. MCEVERS: Now the Pentagon is doing just that. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel has ordered a team to come up with a plan to maximize the number of IDs, improve communication with families and streamline the bureaucracy. DNA scientist Ed Huffine says higher-ups can reorganize all they want, but if JPAC doesn't change its approach. . . HUFFINE: The system will still fail. MCEVERS: Lisa Phillips knows all about how the system can fail a family. Her great Uncle Joe died in a POW camp in Burma during World War II. His remains were later recovered and put on a plane to a U. S. base in India. LISA PHILLIPS: The aircraft went down, 55 minutes from destination and it has not been found since. MCEVERS: Phillips says Joe's wife waited for his body to come home until the day she died in 1980. PHILLIPS: She had said that she would never move out of Connecticut because she wanted the government to know where she lived when they brought her beloved Joe home. MCEVERS: In 2002, Phillips went to JPAC. They didn't take up her case so Phillips and other families hired a private investigator to find the crash site. They tracked down the relatives of the 53 men whose remains were on Uncle Joe's plane and got them to collect and send in their DNA. She says not only did JPAC and the other agencies not ask for the DNA, but when the families went to submit their samples, they found it was nearly impossible to figure out how. They started with the Pentagon's prisoner of war missing personnel office website. PHILLIPS: Then you have to click on the little American flag, then you have to click on World War II, then you have to go search for DNA. MCEVERS: Which took Phillips even further down the rabbit hole, all this to give JPAC a tool most scientists say they should be seeking themselves, ideally in a public nationwide campaign. Uncle Joe's plane still hasn't been found. JPAC did go search one site in India, but it was the wrong plane. Phillips says she won't stop until he is found. PHILLIPS: I will never give up. I've already threatened that. I said don't even think when I'm dead. I said my kids will go look. MCEVERS: Phillips says if major change doesn't happen at JPAC and its sister agencies, agencies that have promised to leave no one behind, she and the thousands of other families who are looking for their lost relatives will have to continue the search on their own. Kelly McEvers, NPR News. BLOCK: This investigation was reported in partnership with the independent news agency ProPublica. NPR and ProPublica were granted rare access to JPAC's central identification lab. You can see photos from the lab on our website, NPR. org. MELISSA BLOCK, HOST:  This is ALL THING CONSIDERED from NPR News. I'm Melissa Block. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:  And I'm Audie Cornish. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel has ordered the Pentagon to revamp its procedures for finding and identifying the bodies of lost service members. That's tens of thousands of Americans who died in World War II, Korea or Vietnam, but whose bodies were never returned. Hagel ordered a team to examine the agencies that handle that mission. And this next report is about what that team will find. For months NPR has investigated the process in partnership with the independent news organization ProPublica. NPR's Kelly McEvers found the agencies to be slow and inefficient and using methods that many scientists say are outdated. KELLY MCEVERS, BYLINE: To understand how these agencies work we focused on the lead agency, the Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command, otherwise known as JPAC. It's housed in a collection of ten low-slung buildings on a U. S. military base in Hawaii. JPAC's mission is this: find, identify and return servicemen whose bodies never made it home from war. And sometimes their process is straight forward. First, says supervising anthropologist Denise To, a team of scientists travels to a site to look for remains. A jungle in Vietnam or Cambodia, a battlefield in Korea or. . . DENISE TO: . . . a beautiful area in Belgium, absolutely stunning rolling green hills. But there's war going on and a plane crash there. And a lot of individuals lost their lives there. MCEVERS: Then whatever's found at the site is brought back to JPAC. The non-biological stuff comes to this lab. Pieces of watches. Is that a lighter? That looks like some kind of jewel piece, piece of a bracelet, another buckle. The biological stuff, the actual remains of the soldier go to the main lab downstairs. So this is the main JPAC lab. And just to describe it what we're looking at is basically just like a series of tables, one, two - what, 15 tables, yeah? And what's laying out on each table are remains, mostly bones. Some of them look to me, a layperson, like almost a complete skeleton. Others, this one that's right in front of us, it's fragments, pieces. In some places almost like dust. We walk up to one of the tables. Forensic anthropologist Marin Pilloud is getting to work on a case. So you're opening a box. MARIN PILLOUD: Yes. This is a mummified foot. These were found in ice, so they're pretty well preserved. MCEVERS: The case is a plane crash from the time of the Korean War. The remains of 19 servicemen were found in a glacier. PILLOUD: Actually I have several guys in soft tissue just over there. MCEVERS: This is one of the straightforward cases. The serial number on the plane led JPAC to a roster of who was on it. Still, Pilloud says it's taken her a year and a half just to sort the remains, test them for DNA and get those test results back.

I'm Guy Raz. And on the show today, extrasensory - ideas on how technology and even human behavior can actually stretch our senses - what we see, what we say, what we feel, what we hear. And for Neil Harbisson, hearing has never been the problem. The problem is seeing. He can see everything, well, everything except for colors. NEIL HARBISSON: I don't see the hue and the saturation, which is blue or red or orange. RAZ: And that's a bit of a problem because Neil is an artist, a painter actually. And if he looks out to the world in front of him just through his eyes, it's like he's living in a black and white film. So to experience color, Neil uses his ears. I guess, like, what does red sound like? HARBISSON: Red is F. RAZ: How about yellow? HARBISSON: Yellow is G. RAZ: OK, what does green sound like? HARBISSON: It's A. So it goes F is the lowest, then orange, then yellow, then green, then turquoise, blue and violet is the highest. RAZ: Wow, that's really cool. OK, so how Neil does this is almost ingeniously simple. He has help from some very cool technology, and how he came about it, how it works - here's the story. Begins at age 11 in Spain where Neil grew up. HARBISSON: Up until then, I just thought that I was confusing colors 'cause I just learned the names of colors, and I learned that the sky was blue and the grass was green. But when I was 11, I was told that I wasn't actually seeing color. I was just memorizing the names of colors. RAZ: And that moment changed everything he thought about himself and his potential. HARBISSON: Well, when I knew that I couldn't see color, I didn't want to wear color either so I asked my parents to buy colorless clothes - so just white, black and gray 'cause I didn't want to wear something that I couldn't see. For many periods, I just hated color and I just wanted a colorless world. RAZ: But very quickly, Neil realized that living a colorless life, it's actually impossible to do that. HARBISSON: Think about sport, there's color codes in sport. If you think about chemistry, there's importance in the color of the material. And color is also in literature. You find color in every book. Every three or four pages, you find the name of a color. Even with things that have nothing to do with color like Yellow Pages or Bluetooth or the green card or James Brown. Brown is in his name. It's everywhere. RAZ: It was like colors all around you. Sounds like - almost like a horror movie, like you're running away from colors. HARBISSON: Yeah, I tried actually. I just thought about living somewhere where color wouldn't exist, maybe in the north where there's just snow. RAZ: Just white. HARBISSON: Yes. One of my aims was to just move to an island where there would be no color. But even there, I'm sure it would be impossible because places like Greenland, it's usually snow there, but the island is called Greenland as well. RAZ: So after trying to run away from it, Neil decided to embrace it. Specifically, he went to art school. And on the first day, he walked right into the Dean's office. HARBISSON: And I said, hi, I don't see color. And he said what the hell are you doing here then? RAZ: OK, so the school let him do all his art in black and white. But color kept coming back to him. It was like this elusive thing he couldn't crack. HARBISSON: It became a mystery to me, color. It became an invisible element that I just wanted to perceive so I became obsessed with color. I just wanted to extend my senses and perceive color. RAZ: And it was right around that time when Neil happened to attend a lecture by an expert on cybernetics. HARBISSON: He was giving this talk about how we could use technology to extend our senses. ADAM MONTANDON: And after the lecture, a young guy approached me. And he was a little bit nervous, a little bit timid. RAZ: This is the guy who gave that lecture. His name is Adam Montandon. MONTANDON: And he said, Adam, you're talking about changing the way that we see the world, but I don't see the world the same as everybody else. And that really got me interested. RAZ: All right, so the thing to mention right here is that colors have frequencies, and Adam Montandon knew that. The question was. . . MONTANDON: How do I translate colors into sound. I took a train ride back home after the lecture, and in the 20 minutes of the train ride, I had the very first ideas already in my head. HARBISSON: The final result was this electronic eye that I've been wearing for almost 10 years now. It's attached to my head and it allows me to hear color. RAZ: All right, so to give you a sense of what Neil looks like, he has this, like, antenna that loops over his head. And attached to the end is a little camera, and that is what looks at and senses colors. OK, so how does it? And, like, can you take it off? HARBISSON: No, it's permanently attached. And then it sends these frequencies to a chip that is installed at the back of my head. And then I hear the colors through bone conductions. RAZ: So you are constantly hearing sounds, like, every time you turn your head, you're constantly hearing things. HARBISSON: Yeah, I'm hearing the wall now here. And when I move my head, I hear the - yeah, now I'm hearing the microphone. And everything sounds 'cause there's color absolutely everywhere. RAZ: And so Neil's obsession with extending his senses, it became a reality. Here's how he described it on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)HARBISSON: So life has changed dramatically since I hear color 'cause color is almost everywhere. So biggest changes, for example, is going to an art gallery, I can listen to a Picasso, for example. So it's like going to a concert hall 'cause I can listen to the paintings. And supermarkets, it's like going to a nightclub. It's full of different melodies, especially the aisle with cleaning products. It's just fabulous. Also, the way I dress has changed. Before, I used to dress in a way that it looked good. Now, I dress in a way that it sounds good. (APPLAUSE)HARBISSON: So today, I'm dressed in C major so it's quite a happy chord. If I had to go to a funeral, though, I would dress in B minor, which would be turquoise, purple and orange. Also, the way I perceive beauty has changed 'cause when I look at someone, I hear their face. So someone might look very beautiful, but sound terrible. And it might happen the opposite - the other way around. So I really enjoy creating, like, sound portraits of people. Instead of drawing someone's face, like, drawing the shape, I point at them with the eye, and I write down the different notes I hear. And then I create sound portraits. Here's some faces. RAZ: OK, so at this point in Neil's talk, he plays some sound portraits. First, of Tom Cruise. (SOUNDBITE OF SOUND PORTRAIT)RAZ: Then there's Al Gore. (SOUNDBITE OF SOUND PORTRAIT)RAZ: He shows Prince Charles. (SOUNDBITE OF SOUND PORTRAIT)RAZ: And this is what Nicole Kidman sounds like. (SOUNDBITE OF SOUND PORTRAIT)HARBISSON: Yeah, Nicole Kidman sounds good. Some people, I would never relate, but they sound similar. Prince Charles has some similarities with Nicole Kidman. They have similar sound of eyes. So you relate people that you wouldn't relate. And you can actually. . . RAZ: It's amazing because it's not just that colors become sounds, but sounds that you hear are translated into color in your mind. HARBISSON: Yeah, that's the secondary effect so it slowly happened. When I started to hear electronic sounds, I felt color. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)HARBISSON: I heard the telephone tone and it felt green 'cause it sounded just like the color green. The BBC beeps, they sound turquoise. So I started to paint music, and paint people's voices 'cause people's voices have frequencies that I relate to color. When you transpose music to color, it's interesting to compare different artists. For example, Mozart used a lot of yellow, which is - in many of his pieces, there's a lot of G notes. Whereas Justin Bieber is very pink because there's lots of E's and also D's in his music. So you realize that artists are using more or less the same colors when they compose. RAZ: I will never listen to Justin Bieber the same ever again. I will always think he sounds pink and very yellow. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"BABY\")RAZ: What's your favorite color, by the way? HARBISSON: Infrared. Infrared is my favorite color. It's the lowest and it's always in unexpected places. RAZ: What does it sound like? HARBISSON: It's very low. It's just (humming) very low. It's actually very nice to hear. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)HARBISSON: So I got to a point when I was able to perceive 360 colors just like human vision. I was able to differentiate all the degrees of the color wheel, but then I just thought that this human vision wasn't good enough. There's many, many more colors around us that we cannot perceive, but the electronic eyes can perceive. So I decided to continue extending my color senses, and I added infrared and I added ultraviolet to the color-to-sound scale. So now I can hear colors that the human eye cannot perceive. For example, perceiving infrared is good 'cause you can actually detect if there's movement detectors in a room. I can hear if someone points at me with a remote control. And the good thing about perceiving ultraviolet is that you can hear if it's a good day or a bad day to sunbathe 'cause ultraviolet is a dangerous color, a color that can actually. . . RAZ: So I read that you think of yourself as like half human, half robot, like a cyborg. HARBISSON: Yeah, I feel that I am technology. I don't feel that I'm wearing technology. And I don't feel that I'm using technology. I feel that I am technology. I feel like the antenna is a part of my body, which is an unusual feeling, but it makes sense. When you've been wearing it for so long, your body just accept this as a part of you. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)HARBISSON: That's why two years ago, I created the Cyborg Foundation, which is a foundation that tries to help people become a cyborg, tries to encourage people to extend their senses by using technology as part of the body. We should all think that knowledge comes from our senses so if we extend our senses, we will consequently extend our knowledge. I think life will be much more exciting when we stop creating applications for mobile phones, and we start creating applications for our own body. I think this will be a big, big change that we'll see during this century. So I do encourage you all to think about which senses you'd like to extend. I would encourage you to become a cyborg. You won't to be alone. Thank you. (APPLAUSE)RAZ: Neil Harbisson. He calls himself the world's first cyborg. Check out his full talk at TED. com. I'm Guy Raz. More ideas about stretching our senses in a moment. You're listening to the TED Radio Hour from NPR. GUY RAZ, HOST:  It's the TED Radio Hour from NPR. I'm Guy Raz. And on the show today, extrasensory - ideas on how technology and even human behavior can actually stretch our senses - what we see, what we say, what we feel, what we hear. And for Neil Harbisson, hearing has never been the problem. The problem is seeing. He can see everything, well, everything except for colors. NEIL HARBISSON: I don't see the hue and the saturation, which is blue or red or orange. RAZ: And that's a bit of a problem because Neil is an artist, a painter actually. And if he looks out to the world in front of him just through his eyes, it's like he's living in a black and white film. So to experience color, Neil uses his ears. I guess, like, what does red sound like? HARBISSON: Red is F. RAZ: How about yellow? HARBISSON: Yellow is G. RAZ: OK, what does green sound like? HARBISSON: It's A. So it goes F is the lowest, then orange, then yellow, then green, then turquoise, blue and violet is the highest. RAZ: Wow, that's really cool. OK, so how Neil does this is almost ingeniously simple. He has help from some very cool technology, and how he came about it, how it works - here's the story. Begins at age 11 in Spain where Neil grew up. HARBISSON: Up until then, I just thought that I was confusing colors 'cause I just learned the names of colors, and I learned that the sky was blue and the grass was green. But when I was 11, I was told that I wasn't actually seeing color. I was just memorizing the names of colors. RAZ: And that moment changed everything he thought about himself and his potential. HARBISSON: Well, when I knew that I couldn't see color, I didn't want to wear color either so I asked my parents to buy colorless clothes - so just white, black and gray 'cause I didn't want to wear something that I couldn't see. For many periods, I just hated color and I just wanted a colorless world. RAZ: But very quickly, Neil realized that living a colorless life, it's actually impossible to do that. HARBISSON: Think about sport, there's color codes in sport. If you think about chemistry, there's importance in the color of the material. And color is also in literature. You find color in every book. Every three or four pages, you find the name of a color. Even with things that have nothing to do with color like Yellow Pages or Bluetooth or the green card or James Brown. Brown is in his name. It's everywhere. RAZ: It was like colors all around you. Sounds like - almost like a horror movie, like you're running away from colors. HARBISSON: Yeah, I tried actually. I just thought about living somewhere where color wouldn't exist, maybe in the north where there's just snow. RAZ: Just white. HARBISSON: Yes. One of my aims was to just move to an island where there would be no color. But even there, I'm sure it would be impossible because places like Greenland, it's usually snow there, but the island is called Greenland as well. RAZ: So after trying to run away from it, Neil decided to embrace it. Specifically, he went to art school. And on the first day, he walked right into the Dean's office. HARBISSON: And I said, hi, I don't see color. And he said what the hell are you doing here then? RAZ: OK, so the school let him do all his art in black and white. But color kept coming back to him. It was like this elusive thing he couldn't crack. HARBISSON: It became a mystery to me, color. It became an invisible element that I just wanted to perceive so I became obsessed with color. I just wanted to extend my senses and perceive color. RAZ: And it was right around that time when Neil happened to attend a lecture by an expert on cybernetics. HARBISSON: He was giving this talk about how we could use technology to extend our senses. ADAM MONTANDON: And after the lecture, a young guy approached me. And he was a little bit nervous, a little bit timid. RAZ: This is the guy who gave that lecture. His name is Adam Montandon. MONTANDON: And he said, Adam, you're talking about changing the way that we see the world, but I don't see the world the same as everybody else. And that really got me interested. RAZ: All right, so the thing to mention right here is that colors have frequencies, and Adam Montandon knew that. The question was. . . MONTANDON: How do I translate colors into sound. I took a train ride back home after the lecture, and in the 20 minutes of the train ride, I had the very first ideas already in my head. HARBISSON: The final result was this electronic eye that I've been wearing for almost 10 years now. It's attached to my head and it allows me to hear color. RAZ: All right, so to give you a sense of what Neil looks like, he has this, like, antenna that loops over his head. And attached to the end is a little camera, and that is what looks at and senses colors. OK, so how does it? And, like, can you take it off? HARBISSON: No, it's permanently attached. And then it sends these frequencies to a chip that is installed at the back of my head. And then I hear the colors through bone conductions. RAZ: So you are constantly hearing sounds, like, every time you turn your head, you're constantly hearing things. HARBISSON: Yeah, I'm hearing the wall now here. And when I move my head, I hear the - yeah, now I'm hearing the microphone. And everything sounds 'cause there's color absolutely everywhere. RAZ: And so Neil's obsession with extending his senses, it became a reality. Here's how he described it on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) HARBISSON: So life has changed dramatically since I hear color 'cause color is almost everywhere. So biggest changes, for example, is going to an art gallery, I can listen to a Picasso, for example. So it's like going to a concert hall 'cause I can listen to the paintings. And supermarkets, it's like going to a nightclub. It's full of different melodies, especially the aisle with cleaning products. It's just fabulous. Also, the way I dress has changed. Before, I used to dress in a way that it looked good. Now, I dress in a way that it sounds good. (APPLAUSE) HARBISSON: So today, I'm dressed in C major so it's quite a happy chord. If I had to go to a funeral, though, I would dress in B minor, which would be turquoise, purple and orange. Also, the way I perceive beauty has changed 'cause when I look at someone, I hear their face. So someone might look very beautiful, but sound terrible. And it might happen the opposite - the other way around. So I really enjoy creating, like, sound portraits of people. Instead of drawing someone's face, like, drawing the shape, I point at them with the eye, and I write down the different notes I hear. And then I create sound portraits. Here's some faces. RAZ: OK, so at this point in Neil's talk, he plays some sound portraits. First, of Tom Cruise. (SOUNDBITE OF SOUND PORTRAIT) RAZ: Then there's Al Gore. (SOUNDBITE OF SOUND PORTRAIT) RAZ: He shows Prince Charles. (SOUNDBITE OF SOUND PORTRAIT) RAZ: And this is what Nicole Kidman sounds like. (SOUNDBITE OF SOUND PORTRAIT) HARBISSON: Yeah, Nicole Kidman sounds good. Some people, I would never relate, but they sound similar. Prince Charles has some similarities with Nicole Kidman. They have similar sound of eyes. So you relate people that you wouldn't relate. And you can actually. . . RAZ: It's amazing because it's not just that colors become sounds, but sounds that you hear are translated into color in your mind. HARBISSON: Yeah, that's the secondary effect so it slowly happened. When I started to hear electronic sounds, I felt color. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) HARBISSON: I heard the telephone tone and it felt green 'cause it sounded just like the color green. The BBC beeps, they sound turquoise. So I started to paint music, and paint people's voices 'cause people's voices have frequencies that I relate to color. When you transpose music to color, it's interesting to compare different artists. For example, Mozart used a lot of yellow, which is - in many of his pieces, there's a lot of G notes. Whereas Justin Bieber is very pink because there's lots of E's and also D's in his music. So you realize that artists are using more or less the same colors when they compose. RAZ: I will never listen to Justin Bieber the same ever again. I will always think he sounds pink and very yellow. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"BABY\") RAZ: What's your favorite color, by the way? HARBISSON: Infrared. Infrared is my favorite color. It's the lowest and it's always in unexpected places. RAZ: What does it sound like? HARBISSON: It's very low. It's just (humming) very low. It's actually very nice to hear. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) HARBISSON: So I got to a point when I was able to perceive 360 colors just like human vision. I was able to differentiate all the degrees of the color wheel, but then I just thought that this human vision wasn't good enough. There's many, many more colors around us that we cannot perceive, but the electronic eyes can perceive. So I decided to continue extending my color senses, and I added infrared and I added ultraviolet to the color-to-sound scale. So now I can hear colors that the human eye cannot perceive. For example, perceiving infrared is good 'cause you can actually detect if there's movement detectors in a room. I can hear if someone points at me with a remote control. And the good thing about perceiving ultraviolet is that you can hear if it's a good day or a bad day to sunbathe 'cause ultraviolet is a dangerous color, a color that can actually. . . RAZ: So I read that you think of yourself as like half human, half robot, like a cyborg. HARBISSON: Yeah, I feel that I am technology. I don't feel that I'm wearing technology. And I don't feel that I'm using technology. I feel that I am technology. I feel like the antenna is a part of my body, which is an unusual feeling, but it makes sense. When you've been wearing it for so long, your body just accept this as a part of you.

I'm Guy Raz. And on the show today, extrasensory - how technology and even human behavior can actually stretch our senses. Hello. Is that Todd? TODD KUIKEN: Yes it is. Hi there. RAZ: So this is Todd Kuiken. He's a doctor and researcher who runs the Center for Bionic Medicine. So I'm sure you've been asked this question before like, a hundred times, but I have to ask you this question 'cause the first time I saw your TED talk, I'm thinking - I'm thinking of Steve Austin. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW \"THE SIX MILLION DOLLAR MAN\")UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: He's alive. He lost an arm, two legs and one eye, but he's alive. RAZ: I'm thinking, gentlemen, we can rebuild him. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW \"THE SIX MILLION DOLLAR MAN\")SPEAKER: We have the capability to make the world's first bionic man. RAZ: Do you remember what they said about him? I mean, they said Steve Austin will be that man, better than he was before. KUIKEN: Well, you know, I loved that show as a kid. And I think it's inspiring, and Lord knows we would love to get there. RAZ: I mean, we are kind of at this sort of bionic human place. KUIKEN: Yes, we have, I believe, crossed a big hurdle by developing a way for a person to control their prosthetic limb that's not just, you know, goofy movements, unintuitive things. We've developed a system where a person thinks about what they want to do and it happens. RAZ: A system where someone with an artificial hand or arm just thinks about moving it and it happens. And Todd isn't actually focused on the robotic arm or hand alone, but his big idea is to literally rewire the human body, to make those arms and hands work better. KUIKEN: Instead of just making a machine for the human, we've changed the human to be able to use the machine better. RAZ: Well, what really amazed me was this - I'm moving my - like, when I want to close my hand or bend my elbow, it's just intuitive, right. Like, we don't - we're not thinking about that. You just do it, but these patients are literally thinking in their brains bend elbow, move hand, and that happens. How does that happen? KUIKEN: Well, think of the brain as where thoughts start, right? That's where you first decide you want to move your hand. And even though you're not thinking about it, you send signals down your neck, and you make the nerve fire. It has little electrical signals that hops down your nerve all the way to the end of the nerve, where little chemicals go across to the muscle and make the muscle have a little electrical spark that hops down the muscle fibers telling them to contract. RAZ: And then your hand just closes, like, without even thinking about it. KUIKEN: Yes. But what happens when you lose your arm above the elbow? RAZ: Right, you don't have those muscles to move your hand anymore. KUIKEN: That's right. You've lost not only the muscles and bones, but the controller. RAZ: OK, so here's where the rewiring comes in, right, because you've lost those critical muscles that control your arm and your hand, but the nerve endings, they're still there. KUIKEN: I could tap the end of a nerve of a World War II amputee and they'd still feel their missing hand. So they're alive and they work. They're like the data cables. RAZ: So the nerve endings and the nerve signals are still there, right, but without those muscles, it's really hard to figure out what those nerve signals are actually saying. KUIKEN: The signals are really, really, really tiny, and you have to listen to it a single nerve fiber at a time. Can't we plug them in someplace better? RAZ: A place that might be able to amplify those nerve signals, and then rewire those nerves to other muscles. Todd explains how this can be done on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)KUIKEN: We're using a biological amplifier to amplify these nerve signals - muscles. Muscles will amplify the nerve signals about 1,000 fold so that we can record them from on top of the skin. So our approach is something we call targeted reinnervation. Imagine with somebody who's lost their whole arm, we still have four major nerves that go down your arm. And we take the nerve away from your chest muscle, and let these nerves grow into it. Now you think close hand, and a little section of your chest contracts. You think bend elbow, a different section contracts. And we can use electrodes or antennas to pick that up and tell the arm to move. That's the idea. RAZ: That's just unbelievable. I mean, you can go into the body and basically say, like, we're going to attach this nerve to that nerve and that nerve to this muscle. It's like you're tricking the brain into, like, thinking a hand is there. KUIKEN: Well, you know, frankly, I'm an engineer and they wouldn't let me rewire people. It's really sad. So my colleague Greg Dumanian at Northwestern is a talented surgeon, and he goes in there and finds the right nerves and the ends of them, and then we redirect them to where we have spare muscle. I guess the analogy I use is that the nerve is a wire, and we've lost the phone at one end, and so we just take the wire and hook it up to a different phone so that we can talk. RAZ: And that's exactly how it works. A computerized, prosthetic arm can pick up the nerve signals and then tell the prosthetic hand to open or close. So, for example, Todd did this with a patient of his, Amanda Kitts, who also joined him on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)KUIKEN: So, Amanda, would you please tell us how you lost your arm. AMANDA KITTS: Sure. In 2006, I had a car accident. And I was driving home from work, and a truck was coming the opposite direction, came over into my lane, ran over the top of my car and his axle tore my arm off. After that, I woke up in the ICU. I didn't know what had happened, and when I realized, you know, that I'd lost my arm, you know, it was completely torn up - I couldn't stop crying for days. KUIKEN: With Amanda, she lost her arm a couple inches above the elbow. So she had a nice, long, residual limb, if you will. RAZ: And that is the place where Todd's team rewired Amanda's nerves. KUIKEN: And we can take the biceps, which has two parts, leave one alone to do the bicep's control of an elbow, but take the other one and put a hand closing nerve into it. And when that nerve grows in, you think close your hand. You aren't thinking bend you're biceps or contract your biceps. You're thinking close my hand, but we've rerouted the nerve, the wire to a different amplifier. KITTS: And then that's when it was like magic after that. I could just open my hand and the hand would open. I didn't have to use any funny movements to work the arm. So it became like, you know, a natural part of me. RAZ: And Todd, he was delighted, but he wanted to take it just a step further. So he started to think more about the nerve. KUIKEN: The nerve actually controls each of your fingers, your thumb, your wrist. Now my colleagues have developed computer decoding algorithms that are a lot like voice recognition. And so we listen to the signals from the muscle, and these computer programs decode it so that we can tell whether you want to close your hand, bend your wrist, turn your wrist or even what type of hand-grasp pattern you want to make. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)KITTS: So I have the elbow that goes up and down. I have the wrist rotation that goes. . . (LAUGHTER)KITTS: . . . And it can go all the way around. And I have the wrist flexion and extension. RAZ: At this moment when everybody laughs, she's just turned her entire wrist 360 degrees. KUIKEN: Yeah, well, that's quite a bar trick for you because you give somebody something they can do and they will use it. So sometimes that's functional 'cause you can flip it into a position that isn't even humanoid. RAZ: And the thing about rewiring those nerves is that when you do that, it means that prosthetic hands are actually getting a lot closer than ever before to a real human hand because the nerves, they can still feel and touch. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)KUIKEN: I want you to watch closely. CLAUDIA MITCHELL: Oh. KUIKEN: That's Claudia and that was the first time she got to feel sensation through a prosthetic. She had a little sensor at the end of her prosthesis that then she rubbed over different services, and she could feel different textures of sand paper, different grits, ribbon cable, as it pushed on her reinnervated hand skin. She said that when she just ran it across the table, it felt like her finger was rocking. It was one of those scientific surprises. In those nerves to your hand, actually two thirds of them are for sensation. Only one third are for controlling muscles. So there's thousands and thousands of nerves that are trying to grow out into something, and most of them are sensation. And they grew into any little sensory end organ they could. RAZ: So earlier in the show, we spoke to Neil Harbisson who calls himself a cyborg, right. I mean, his antenna is literally screwed into the bone of his skull. And I wonder if that's sort of the direction we're headed with sort of bionic technology. I mean, could you imagine half-human half-machines who can function normally despite having been born with disabilities or limitations? KUIKEN: Well, I certainly imagine and we're progressing to having machines help people with disabilities and on even more and more intimate ways. As far as half-human half-machine, I take challenge to that because the essence of human is in our minds and what we think and what we do. And I don't see that ever being replaced. I hope we have things to augment, but I don't ever feel my humanity is going to be integrated with any form of machine. RAZ: I was thinking about this idea of like, energy that travels through our body. And that energy travels from person to person. Like, when I hold my son's hand, you know, there's that feeling of holding a kid's hand, you know. And I wonder if you could ever replicate that in a prosthetic hand? KUIKEN: Wow, that's a tough - that's an exciting one. And the question is how much do you get from having it being your own hand? So let me put it this way - something is always better than nothing. So you're holding your son's hand with a very rich, sensory-normal hand, and you get all of these delicate feelings. But for a man with no hands, no arms, if we put a sensor in the prosthesis so that as he touches that child's hand, and it's nothing more than a little squeeze that he feels, but yet it's his squeeze, and it's his kid's hand. So perhaps the fidelity of the feeling is not near as important as the identity of the feeling, and the fact that it's my hand that is touching something, and gosh, that's my kid.

She had a little sensor at the end of her prosthesis that then she rubbed over different services, and she could feel different textures of sand paper, different grits, ribbon cable, as it pushed on her reinnervated hand skin. She said that when she just ran it across the table, it felt like her finger was rocking. It was one of those scientific surprises. In those nerves to your hand, actually two thirds of them are for sensation. Only one third are for controlling muscles. So there's thousands and thousands of nerves that are trying to grow out into something, and most of them are sensation. And they grew into any little sensory end organ they could. RAZ: So earlier in the show, we spoke to Neil Harbisson who calls himself a cyborg, right. I mean, his antenna is literally screwed into the bone of his skull. And I wonder if that's sort of the direction we're headed with sort of bionic technology. I mean, could you imagine half-human half-machines who can function normally despite having been born with disabilities or limitations? KUIKEN: Well, I certainly imagine and we're progressing to having machines help people with disabilities and on even more and more intimate ways. As far as half-human half-machine, I take challenge to that because the essence of human is in our minds and what we think and what we do. And I don't see that ever being replaced. I hope we have things to augment, but I don't ever feel my humanity is going to be integrated with any form of machine. RAZ: I was thinking about this idea of like, energy that travels through our body. And that energy travels from person to person. Like, when I hold my son's hand, you know, there's that feeling of holding a kid's hand, you know. And I wonder if you could ever replicate that in a prosthetic hand? KUIKEN: Wow, that's a tough - that's an exciting one. And the question is how much do you get from having it being your own hand? So let me put it this way - something is always better than nothing. So you're holding your son's hand with a very rich, sensory-normal hand, and you get all of these delicate feelings. But for a man with no hands, no arms, if we put a sensor in the prosthesis so that as he touches that child's hand, and it's nothing more than a little squeeze that he feels, but yet it's his squeeze, and it's his kid's hand. So perhaps the fidelity of the feeling is not near as important as the identity of the feeling, and the fact that it's my hand that is touching something, and gosh, that's my kid.

What is the future of the human race? Are we alone in the universe? GUY RAZ, HOST: So this is a voice you probably know - physicist Stephen Hawking, of course. But the weird thing about this voice is that it's not just his voice. This is the exact same computerized voice that's used by thousands of people around the world who cannot speak on their own. And we know this at Stephen Hawking because, well, he's Stephen Hawking. RUPAL PATEL: But there's little girls and older women and lots of other people who are using that voice, even though he thinks of that as being his voice, right. And so do the other people who are using those voices. They think about them as being their voice. RAZ: This is Rupal Patel. PATEL: I'm a speech scientist and a professor at Northeastern University. RAZ: And Rupal has figured out a way to create new voices, customized voices for people who use synthetic speech, people whose actual voices, for whatever reason - autism or cerebral palsy or stroke - can't speak. And the story of how it all came about - Rupal explains from the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)PATEL: This lack of individuation of the synthetic voice really hit home when I was at an assistive technology conference a few years ago. And I recall seeing a little girl and a grown man having a conversation using their devices. UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER #1: Nice to meet youUNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER #2: Nice to meet you, tooPATEL: Different devices. SPEAKER #1: How long have you been coming to this conference? PATEL: But the same voice. SPEAKER #2: This is my first year. PATEL: I looked around, and I saw this happening all around me. UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER #3: I've never been there. UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER #4: Where is the registration table? UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER #5: What time should we meet back at the hotel? PATEL: Voices that didn't fit their bodies or their personalities. UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER #6: Where are you staying? UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER #7: How long are you in town? UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER #8: Our flight was late coming in from Detroit. PATEL: We wouldn't dream of fitting a little girl with a prosthetic limb of a grown man. So why then the same prosthetic voice? It really struck me, and I wanted to do something about this. I'm going to play you now a sample of two people, actually, who have severe speech disorder. They're saying the same utterance. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: (Unintelligible). UNIDENTIFIED MAN: (Unintelligible). PATEL: You probably didn't understand what they said, but I hope that you heard their unique vocal identities. I wanted to find out how we could harness these residual vocal abilities and build a technology that could be customized for them, voices that could be customized for them. So we decided to do exactly that. RAZ: With a girl named Samantha. Samantha has a very rare speech disorder, which makes it impossible for her to speak. But she can make sounds, vowel-like sounds, which turned out to be enough of a sample for Rupal and her team of researchers. (SOUNDBITE OF RECORDING)SAMANTHA: Ah. PATEL: That sound is just what Samantha can produce. That's her ah. And from that, we can gather the pitch of her voice. (SOUNDBITE OF RECORDING)SAMANTHA: Ah. PATEL: The quality of her voice, meaning things like is it raspy, is it breathy. RAZ: So you are hearing all of these things. I mean, she can't create words or sentences, but she can make some basic sounds. PATEL: Right. And we take what we can from those vocalizations and use them in the process for - we generate a voice for her that sounds like her. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)PATEL: So how do you go about building this voice? Well, you have to find someone who's willing to be a surrogate. For Samantha, her surrogate came from somewhere in the Midwest - a stranger who gave her the gift of voice. Being a surrogate donor only requires you to say a few hundred to a few thousand utterances. The process goes something like this. UNIDENTIFIED SURROGATE: Things happen in pairs. I love to sleep. The sky is blue without clouds. PATEL: Now she's going to go on like this for about three to four hours. The idea is to cover all the different combinations of the sounds that occur in the language. From this voice bank, we can now say any new utterance like, I love chocolate - everyone needs to be able to say that - fish through that database and find all the segments necessary to say that utterance. WOMAN: I love chocolate. PATEL: What happens next is best described by my daughter's analogy. She's 6. She calls it mixing colors to paint voices. It's exactly that. Samantha's voice is like a concentrated sample of red food dye, which we can infuse into the recordings of her surrogate to get a pink voice. SAMANTHA: Ah. PATEL: So now Samantha can say this. . . SAMANTHA: This voice sounds like the real me. I helped make my new voice. I can't wait to use my new voice with my friends. RAZ: That's incredible. PATEL: I'm so glad you think that's incredible because, you know, as a scientist, though - I mean, there's been so many versions of that process. And even if they're not perfect, even if they have crackliness to the voice, even if they're not absolutely perfect in terms of speech quality, they're made with a little bit of them. And that is such a powerful thing. So for Samantha, when she heard her voice, there's this smile that spread across her face when she heard it for the first time. What I love about that is it's not her jumping up and down and saying, you know, yeah, this is my voice. It's this sort of slow realization that this is who I am. RAZ: Speech scientist Rupal Patel. In a moment, we'll hear more about her research and another young girl who just got a brand-new non-Stephen Hawking-like voice. I'm Guy Raz. Stay with us. You're listening to the TED Radio Hour from NPR. (MUSIC)RAZ: It's the TED Radio Hour from NPR. I'm Guy Raz. And on the show today, extrasensory - technology and behavior that can actually stretch our senses. And we were just talking with speech scientist Rupal Patel who designs devices for people who can't speak because she wants them to sound more like humans, like themselves rather than robots. PATEL: Many times, people who have these communication devices don't use their devices that often. And that's, you know, that's terrible because it kind of closes the world for them. I hope that this technology opens their door for them. SHANNON WARD: My name is Shannon. RAZ: And how old are you? S. WARD: I'm 13 years old. RAZ: This is Shannon Ward, and she was born with cerebral palsy. And a few months ago, Rupal essentially gave Shannon her own voice, and she built it on the vowel-like sounds that Shannon is able to make. S. WARD: Yes. I think everyone deserves to be heard. RAZ: So, Shannon, like, the voice you had before the one you have now, did you like it? S. WARD: Not so much. RAZ: So tell me about your new voice. S. WARD: Totally love it. RAZ: Does it feel like it's you? S. WARD: That's a big fat yes. JANINE WARD: To hear it, I was just stunned because I can hear my daughter, especially in certain words. RAZ: This is Shannon's mom, Janine. J. WARD: And when she says mom, in particular, I hear her. And that is a wonderful thing for any parent to experience. RAZ: Does she seem like it's changed her? J. WARD: Absolutely. It just increased her confidence, it increased her desire to want to use her device. I know, personally, that she loves to talk with her friends more. She stands out, and I think people take her differently when they hear a voice that sounds like a 13-year-old girl as opposed to a voice that sounds like a robot of an adult. RAZ: OK, you have a 13-year-old daughter. She is now a teenager. If she's talking more, is she arguing more with you? J. WARD: Absolutely. I know it might sound so bizarre, but there are times I'm like, can we unplug the device for a little bit because I have a kid that does not stop. RAZ: So back to Rupal Patel, the speech scientist who started all of this - she's trying to get people all over the world to become voice donors to help people like Shannon. PATEL: Yeah, and I think the beautiful thing about this is that as someone grows, what we'd like to see is that many people who use augmentative communication devices, these communication aids, use the same voice for much of their life. But you and I don't have the same voice today as we had a decade ago and a decade before that, certainly. It's layers and layers of experiences and changes in our body that change our voice. That should be afforded to these individuals as well. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)PATEL: What I want to share with you next is how I envision taking this work to that next level. I imagine a whole world of surrogate donors from all walks of life, different sizes, different ages coming together in this voice drive to give people voices that are as colorful as their personalities. About five years ago, we built our very first voice for a little boy named William. When his mom first heard this voice, she said this is what William would have sounded like had he been able to speak. And then I saw William typing a message on his device. I wondered what was he thinking? Imagine carrying around someone else's voice for nine years and finally finding your own voice. Imagine that. This is what Williams said. Never heard me before. Thank you. (APPLAUSE)RAZ: Rupal Patel is a speech scientist at Northeastern University. She and her collaborator Tim Bunnell started a project where almost anyone can donate their voice to people like Shannon and Samantha. And you can do it, too. If you want to help out, go to Vocalid. org and give them some of your voice. And of course, you can watch Rupal's full talk at TED. com. STEPHEN HAWKING: Where did we come from?

But what if you don't need that technology? And what if you aren't using your senses to their fullest potential without even knowing about it? Well, that - that's Julian Treasure's big idea. Julian studies sound. JULIAN TREASURE: I'm totally obsessed with sound. It's my life. But do you know something? I think, Guy, that most people are secretly fascinated by sound. RAZ: Really? TREASURE: Yeah, we've just got used to, over the last 200 years, to suppressing sound because of the. . . (SOUNDBITE OF NOISE MONTAGE)TREASURE: . . . Noise. I mean, there's just so much noise pollution now. And we've just got into the habit of suppressing our sense of hearing. So a big part of my mission in life is to get people listening consciously. RAZ: Julian's idea is that sound affects your life in a bunch of ways you never even think about. But the flipside of that idea is that becoming aware of sound and really listening, it can actually make our lives a little better. For instance, a couple years ago, the city of Lancaster, in California, was trying to figure out how to keep petty criminals from doing things like stealing purses and harassing shoppers on the main drag. And city officials tried all kinds of crime-prevention techniques, but no luck. So they called Julian, and he installed. . . TREASURE: . . . Hundreds of all-weather, Bose loudspeakers in the main street called the Boulevards. RAZ: And those speakers played this soundscape for five hours a day. (SOUNDBITE OF SOUNDSCAPE)TREASURE: And what happened, according to the sheriff of Lancaster, Calif. , is that crime fell 15 percent after that soundscape. . . RAZ: Fifteen percent after that. . . TREASURE: Yep. RAZ: . . . Soundscape came on. TREASURE: Yep. And they absolutely love it. RAZ: And, I mean, come on. There's no way this is not bringing your heart rate down a little bit, right? I mean, you've got a little gentle surf in there. (SOUNDBITE OF SOUNDSCAPE)TREASURE: The surf, incidentally, that kind of gentle surf has a cadence of roughly 12 cycles per minute, which is very similar to the breathing of a sleeping human being. And so we find it a very restful sound. RAZ: And the birds? TREASURE: Just because we've evolved to it over 250,000 years, it's the sound of security because when the birds are singing, generally things are OK. (SOUNDBITE OF SOUNDSCAPE)TREASURE: If they suddenly stop, you need to be worrying. You know, at this point, somebody out there will be thinking manipulation because that's the word that I always encounter when I start talking about designing soundscapes. RAZ: Right. TREASURE: And the answer I give to that is, do you feel manipulated by architecture? Do you feel manipulated by color? Do you feel manipulated by street layout? Because you are being changed by those things. They are consciously designed. So why would we start to think we're being manipulative the moment we start to design soundscapes? RAZ: And what Julian argues is that listening is the most undervalued sense we have. But our ability to listen, to really listen, it's slipping away. Here's his TED Talk. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)TREASURE: We are losing our listening. We spend roughly 60 percent of our communication time listening, but we're not very good at it. We retain just 25 percent of what we hear. Now, not you, not this talk, but that is generally true. Let's define listening as making meaning from sound. It's a mental process, and it's a process of extraction. We use some pretty cool techniques to do this. One of them is pattern recognition. (BACKGROUND CROWD CHATTER)TREASURE: So in a cocktail party like this, if I say, David, Sarah, pay attention, some of you just sat up. We recognize patterns to distinguish noise from signal and especially, our name. Differencing is another technique we use. (SCRATCHY SOUND)TREASURE: If I left this pink noise on for more than a couple of minutes, you would literally, cease to hear it. We listen to differences. We discount sounds that remain the same. Most people are entirely unconscious of these filters, but they actually create our reality, in a way, because they tell us what we're paying attention to right now. I'll give you one example of that. Intention is very important in sound, in listening. When I married my wife, I promised her that I would listen to her every day as if for the first time. Now, that's something I fall short of on a daily basis, but it's a great intention to have in a relationship. I said at the beginning, we're losing our listening. This is not trivial because listening is our access to understanding. Conscious listening always creates understanding. A world where we don't listen to each other at all is a very scary place indeed. RAZ: And Julian Treasure thinks there are all kinds of things getting in the way of our listening. Just think about all the sounds around you every day. In Europe, where Julian does most of his work. . . TREASURE: . . . Something like 8 million people are having their sleep seriously disturbed by traffic noise at night. RAZ: And a lot of the people ride the subway every day, including Julian. TREASURE: And I wear hearing protectors every time I can. RAZ: Every time you go. TREASURE: Yeah. RAZ: Wow. TREASURE: I'm shocked every day. I see people standing on the cheap station as this screech is happening at a 110, 120 decibels, and they're just standing there. RAZ: And once you get to work - well, researchers have actually tested people in these noisy, open-plan office environments. TREASURE: And they found that productivity dropped by two-thirds. . . RAZ: Wow. TREASURE: Sixty-six percent drop in productivity in open-plan office types. . . RAZ: In open-plan offices. TREASURE: The bosses, of course, are all in hermetically sealed offices, so they're not even aware that this a problem. RAZ: Yeah. TREASURE: But there's a lot of research now showing that noise, and the lack of quiet working space, is one of the biggest issues for all office workers. RAZ: What does it do to people? TREASURE: It creates stress hormones, increases your risk of heart attack. It increases your risk of stroke. And there's a whole range of other issues - sexual dysfunction, bowel dysfunction, depression, psychological disorders - which are associated with living in noisy situations day in and day out. RAZ: OK, so that's the environmental stuff that Julian says is making it harder for us to listen. But there are also things inside our own heads that get in the way. So, for example, you might notice that sometimes, you know, when you get a group of people together - right? - the conversation isn't really a conversation. People don't often ask other people questions, and they don't really listen. They just sort of take turns telling stories about themselves. TREASURE: Yes, so I call that speech writing. And it's not really listening, you know. If you're - while the other person's talking, that's just a sort of gap while you're writing your next bon meau. . . RAZ: In your mind. TREASURE: Exactly. That's not actually listening to somebody. RAZ: And listening takes brainpower. There are studies that show that the human brain can only understand 1. 6 conversations at a time, which is enough for one person, and a little bit of your inner monologue. TREASURE: That's the amount of auditory bandwidth we have. And if you're in an office where you can overhear one person talking right next to you, they're taking up one of your 1. 6. We don't have any earlids. And unless you put headphones on, that person's conversation is inevitably going to be decoded in your brain because we're programmed to decode conversation. RAZ: And the way we listen might also be hard-wired, depending on our gender. TREASURE: Men tend to listen in, what I call, a reductive way, which is to say for a point, for a solution. You know, we like to have a problem and solve it. Bang. Thank you very much. On to the next thing. RAZ: Yeah. TREASURE: Women tend, on the other hand, to listen in more of an expansive way. It's not about a point. It's not about a solution. It's just about going with the flow and being with the person, and listening and enjoying the journey with them. So you get this mismatch where she comes home and says: I've had a terrible day, darling. It's been absolutely awful. This happened, that happened. And he says: Have a bath, you'll be fine. So I think the two listenings are quite different. And when we become conscious of our filters, then we can start to play with them and change our listening position. And that is a very, very powerful thing to do. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)TREASURE: So I'd like to share with you exercises, tools you can take away with you, to improve your own conscious listening. Would you like that? UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBERS: Yes. TREASURE: Good. The first one is silence. Just three minutes a day of silence is a wonderful exercise to reset your years, and to recalibrate so that you can hear the quiet again. If you can't get absolute silence, go for quiet. That's absolutely fine. Second, I call this the mixer. So even if you're in a noisy environment like this, and we all spend a lot of time in places like this, listen in the coffee bar to how many channels of sound can I hear? How many individual channels in that mix am I listening to? You can do it in a beautiful place as well, like a lake. How many birds am I hearing? Where are they? Where are those ripples? It's a great exercise for improving the quality of your listening. And finally, an acronym. The acronym is RASA, which is the Sanskrit word for juice or essence. And RASA stands for receive, which means pay attention to the person, appreciate - making little noises like hm, oh, OK, summarize - the word \"so\" is very important in communication, and ask - ask questions afterwards. RAZ: I love that. I mean, that - 'cause that's what I do, right? I talk to people, and I ask them questions. And I listen to them. TREASURE: Absolutely. RAZ: And I love doing it. It's a real gift that I get to have. TREASURE: Do you know, I often think that listening is the most generous gift you can give to another human being. And many people have never had that experience. RAZ: Yeah. TREASURE: I often have said to my teenage children as they're looking down, doing something on their phone, and they're saying I am listening. I say no, that's not listening. But when you think about it, we've got four ways of communicating - reading, writing, speaking, listening. We spend all our time teaching reading and writing. We spend absolutely no time at all, in most schools, teaching either speaking or, more importantly still, listening. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)TREASURE: And if we can teach listening in our schools, we can take our listening off that slippery slope to that dangerous, scary world that I talked about, and move it to a place where everybody is consciously listening all the time - or at least capable of doing it. Now, sound is my passion. It's my life. I wrote a whole book about it, so I live to listen. That's too much to ask for most people. But I believe that every human being needs to listen consciously in order to live fully; connected in space and in time to the physical world around us, connected in understanding to each other, not to mention spiritually connected because every spiritual path I know of has listening and contemplation at its heart. So I invite you to connect with me, connect with each other, take this mission out. And let's get listening taught in schools and transform the world, in one generation, to a conscious listening world; a world of connection, a world of understanding, and a world of peace. Thank you for listening to me today. (APPLAUSE)RAZ: Julian Treasure is the chairman of the Sound Agency. He's got four TED Talks, all of them pretty spectacular - and all of them at TED. com. (MUSIC)UNIDENTIFIED SINGER: You say that I've lost all good sense, but don't believe it's true. I couldn't see, hear, smell or feel before I was seeing you. Now I'm feeling things I've never felt and my sight has been restored. I'm using all my senses like I've never used before. I'm using all my senses like I've never used before. . . RAZ: Hey, thanks for listening to this episode, \"Extrasensory. \" If you missed any of it, or you want to hear more or you want to find out more about who was on it, you can visit TED. NPR. org. You can also find many more TED Talks at TED. com, and you can download this show through iTunes or through the NPR smartphone app. GUY RAZ, HOST:  So - so far, we've been talking about how technology can stretch human senses, right? But what if you don't need that technology? And what if you aren't using your senses to their fullest potential without even knowing about it? Well, that - that's Julian Treasure's big idea. Julian studies sound. JULIAN TREASURE: I'm totally obsessed with sound. It's my life. But do you know something? I think, Guy, that most people are secretly fascinated by sound. RAZ: Really? TREASURE: Yeah, we've just got used to, over the last 200 years, to suppressing sound because of the. . . (SOUNDBITE OF NOISE MONTAGE) TREASURE: . . . Noise. I mean, there's just so much noise pollution now. And we've just got into the habit of suppressing our sense of hearing. So a big part of my mission in life is to get people listening consciously. RAZ: Julian's idea is that sound affects your life in a bunch of ways you never even think about. But the flipside of that idea is that becoming aware of sound and really listening, it can actually make our lives a little better. For instance, a couple years ago, the city of Lancaster, in California, was trying to figure out how to keep petty criminals from doing things like stealing purses and harassing shoppers on the main drag. And city officials tried all kinds of crime-prevention techniques, but no luck. So they called Julian, and he installed. . . TREASURE: . . . Hundreds of all-weather, Bose loudspeakers in the main street called the Boulevards. RAZ: And those speakers played this soundscape for five hours a day. (SOUNDBITE OF SOUNDSCAPE) TREASURE: And what happened, according to the sheriff of Lancaster, Calif. , is that crime fell 15 percent after that soundscape. . . RAZ: Fifteen percent after that. . . TREASURE: Yep. RAZ: . . . Soundscape came on. TREASURE: Yep. And they absolutely love it. RAZ: And, I mean, come on. There's no way this is not bringing your heart rate down a little bit, right? I mean, you've got a little gentle surf in there. (SOUNDBITE OF SOUNDSCAPE) TREASURE: The surf, incidentally, that kind of gentle surf has a cadence of roughly 12 cycles per minute, which is very similar to the breathing of a sleeping human being. And so we find it a very restful sound. RAZ: And the birds? TREASURE: Just because we've evolved to it over 250,000 years, it's the sound of security because when the birds are singing, generally things are OK. (SOUNDBITE OF SOUNDSCAPE) TREASURE: If they suddenly stop, you need to be worrying. You know, at this point, somebody out there will be thinking manipulation because that's the word that I always encounter when I start talking about designing soundscapes. RAZ: Right. TREASURE: And the answer I give to that is, do you feel manipulated by architecture? Do you feel manipulated by color? Do you feel manipulated by street layout? Because you are being changed by those things. They are consciously designed. So why would we start to think we're being manipulative the moment we start to design soundscapes? RAZ: And what Julian argues is that listening is the most undervalued sense we have. But our ability to listen, to really listen, it's slipping away. Here's his TED Talk. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) TREASURE: We are losing our listening. We spend roughly 60 percent of our communication time listening, but we're not very good at it. We retain just 25 percent of what we hear. Now, not you, not this talk, but that is generally true. Let's define listening as making meaning from sound. It's a mental process, and it's a process of extraction. We use some pretty cool techniques to do this. One of them is pattern recognition. (BACKGROUND CROWD CHATTER) TREASURE: So in a cocktail party like this, if I say, David, Sarah, pay attention, some of you just sat up. We recognize patterns to distinguish noise from signal and especially, our name. Differencing is another technique we use. (SCRATCHY SOUND) TREASURE: If I left this pink noise on for more than a couple of minutes, you would literally, cease to hear it. We listen to differences. We discount sounds that remain the same. Most people are entirely unconscious of these filters, but they actually create our reality, in a way, because they tell us what we're paying attention to right now. I'll give you one example of that. Intention is very important in sound, in listening. When I married my wife, I promised her that I would listen to her every day as if for the first time. Now, that's something I fall short of on a daily basis, but it's a great intention to have in a relationship. I said at the beginning, we're losing our listening. This is not trivial because listening is our access to understanding. Conscious listening always creates understanding. A world where we don't listen to each other at all is a very scary place indeed. RAZ: And Julian Treasure thinks there are all kinds of things getting in the way of our listening. Just think about all the sounds around you every day. In Europe, where Julian does most of his work. . . TREASURE: . . . Something like 8 million people are having their sleep seriously disturbed by traffic noise at night. RAZ: And a lot of the people ride the subway every day, including Julian. TREASURE: And I wear hearing protectors every time I can. RAZ: Every time you go. TREASURE: Yeah. RAZ: Wow. TREASURE: I'm shocked every day. I see people standing on the cheap station as this screech is happening at a 110, 120 decibels, and they're just standing there. RAZ: And once you get to work - well, researchers have actually tested people in these noisy, open-plan office environments. TREASURE: And they found that productivity dropped by two-thirds. . . RAZ: Wow. TREASURE: Sixty-six percent drop in productivity in open-plan office types. . . RAZ: In open-plan offices. TREASURE: The bosses, of course, are all in hermetically sealed offices, so they're not even aware that this a problem. RAZ: Yeah. TREASURE: But there's a lot of research now showing that noise, and the lack of quiet working space, is one of the biggest issues for all office workers. RAZ: What does it do to people? TREASURE: It creates stress hormones, increases your risk of heart attack. It increases your risk of stroke. And there's a whole range of other issues - sexual dysfunction, bowel dysfunction, depression, psychological disorders - which are associated with living in noisy situations day in and day out. RAZ: OK, so that's the environmental stuff that Julian says is making it harder for us to listen. But there are also things inside our own heads that get in the way. So, for example, you might notice that sometimes, you know, when you get a group of people together - right? - the conversation isn't really a conversation. People don't often ask other people questions, and they don't really listen. They just sort of take turns telling stories about themselves. TREASURE: Yes, so I call that speech writing. And it's not really listening, you know. If you're - while the other person's talking, that's just a sort of gap while you're writing your next bon meau. . . RAZ: In your mind. TREASURE: Exactly. That's not actually listening to somebody. RAZ: And listening takes brainpower. There are studies that show that the human brain can only understand 1. 6 conversations at a time, which is enough for one person, and a little bit of your inner monologue. TREASURE: That's the amount of auditory bandwidth we have. And if you're in an office where you can overhear one person talking right next to you, they're taking up one of your 1. 6. We don't have any earlids. And unless you put headphones on, that person's conversation is inevitably going to be decoded in your brain because we're programmed to decode conversation. RAZ: And the way we listen might also be hard-wired, depending on our gender. TREASURE: Men tend to listen in, what I call, a reductive way, which is to say for a point, for a solution. You know, we like to have a problem and solve it. Bang. Thank you very much. On to the next thing. RAZ: Yeah. TREASURE: Women tend, on the other hand, to listen in more of an expansive way. It's not about a point. It's not about a solution. It's just about going with the flow and being with the person, and listening and enjoying the journey with them. So you get this mismatch where she comes home and says: I've had a terrible day, darling. It's been absolutely awful. This happened, that happened. And he says: Have a bath, you'll be fine. So I think the two listenings are quite different. And when we become conscious of our filters, then we can start to play with them and change our listening position. And that is a very, very powerful thing to do. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) TREASURE: So I'd like to share with you exercises, tools you can take away with you, to improve your own conscious listening.

I'm Arun Rath. In 1966, psychedelic drug advocate and former Harvard professor Timothy Leary appeared on \"The Merv Griffin Show. \"(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"THE MERV GRIFFIN SHOW\")RATH: You can tell that sounded completely insane to the studio audience. It was the late 1960s, the summer of love, the massive anti-war protests and experimentation with psychedelic drugs. The authorities cracked down on hallucinogens, reclassifying them as Schedule I drugs, meaning they had no known medical use. Research on the medical uses of LSD and other psychedelics was effectively shut down. Today, scientists are picking up where Timothy Leary and others left off. Psychedelic research is back, and that's our cover story today. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"LEGEND OF A MIND\")RATH: Back in the '50s and '60s, Stanislav Grof was one of the leading researchers on the therapeutic applications of LSD and other hallucinogens. He studied their effects on mental disorders, including addiction. Grof says LSD seemed to accelerate treatment of mental illness exponentially. Some alcoholics even appeared to be cured, never touching a drink again after their LSD session. DR. STANISLAV GROF: It was quite extraordinary. This was a tremendous deepening and acceleration of the psychotherapeutic process. And compared with the therapy in general, which mostly focuses on suppression of symptoms, here, we had something that could actually get to the core of the problems. RATH: But the pervasive image of LSD was as a recreational drug and not a medicine. By the 1970s, research had been stigmatized. But in the 1990s, attitudes began to change. There was a flurry of studies on psychedelic drugs. By the 2000s, there was a small but growing research community picking up where Grof and others had left off. One area that showed promise was using hallucinogens to ease anxiety and depression in patients with cancer. Patients like Erica Rex. ERICA REX: I was diagnosed with breast cancer stage 2 in 2009, on April Fools' Day, great day to be diagnosed with breast cancer. Even if people are happy to spout statistics at you about your chances for survival, that's not exactly what happens in emotional or human terms. I went through the treatment, and there's a group of drugs called aromatase inhibitors. They have extreme side effects, and that can also include depression, which, for me, it did. RATH: Erica told me she became obsessed with the possibility of her death. It was crippling. And then Rex found out she might qualify for a depression study using an experimental drug: psilocybin. It's an active compound in psychedelic mushrooms. Just to get into the study was an ordeal - tons of lab tests, days at the hospital and then a very intense psychological workup with some probing questions. REX: One that stuck out was, do you think that people on the television or the radio are saying things specifically to you or that there are coded messages in advertising, stuff like that. It's like having five years of therapy or psychoanalysis stuffed into three days. It was exhausting. RATH: But at the end of it all, she was approved for the study. She would be given two doses of the hallucinogen in two separate sessions, with trained guides sitting with her as the drugs took effect. Now, what she's about to describe is an intense drug experience, a trip. It's also a science experiment. Her experience began in a windowless room. REX: The setting is basically a room, an office or a hospital room, and it's been decorated with sort of lots of hangings, and it looks like a sitting room. It's comfortable enough. They have a blood pressure machine because they take your blood pressure every 15 minutes or half an hour during the whole experience. RATH: So then you take the hallucinogen psilocybin. What does a psilocybin pill look like? REX: It was a little purple capsule. You take the capsule, you drink a whole cup of water, and you have an eyeshade on and you have earphones on through which there's music. They have a very elaborately, thought-out music track that they play throughout the day that doesn't - essentially doesn't repeat. It started out being very ecclesiastical. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)REX: The music became very absorbing and involved. I mean, it went to symphonic music, which I prefer and which was much better, and then kind of world music, you know, things that were more kind of indigenous-type music from foreign countries. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)REX: It was a journey. There was a progression of things that happened. There was one that was very particular in which I was being confronted by a little boy with a slingshot who had his arm sort of braced in a tree and was ready to shoot a pebble at me. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)REX: And then that was one image. And then something funny happened, and I started laughing. And my laughter was then jewels, like sparkling jewels or a starlight pouring out of a sky - an aperture in the sky. I can't verbalize it because people want it to be described as though it were a dream, and it's not. It is actual. So it is as real as my sitting on the bed clutching this microphone, and it's all entirely real. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RATH: But it wasn't all starlight and laughter. REX: I became nauseated. There were parts of the struggle with nausea that brought back things, issues that were from my family, from my young life that were excruciating and upset me a whole lot. At the very end of the day, as I recall, the last song that is played at the end of whatever it is, six hours, is \"Here Comes the Sun. \" And then you go spend an evening with a trusted person and write up everything that you can possibly remember. RATH: Coming away from this now with some distance from it, how has it affected your depression? REX: I'm much better. I am able to plan. I don't sit around obsessing about what the future may hold nearly as much. RATH: Erica Rex tells me her depression lifted and her life is undoubtedly better. But as much as the psychedelic experience helped her, some authorities say there are significant questions about whether they are safe and effective for everyone. Glen Hanson is a senior adviser for the National Institute on Drug Abuse. GLEN HANSON: I think there still needs to be an asterisk next to it. I don't think that it looks like a brand-new antidepressant. There are enough people who've gotten into trouble with these things. And we know that there's this lack of predictability. RATH: Hanson says the main problem with hallucinogens is that they affect people in wildly different ways. HANSON: There are people who get into trouble with these drugs. Usually, these are folks who have emotional disturbances already in place and you superimpose - like an LSD - on someone that's a schizophrenic, and you don't know what you're going to get. Because that's almost the definition of hallucinogens is you go in and you scramble the chemistry of the brain. And if it's already \"scrambled\" - again I put that in quotation marks - but if it's already abnormal, where are you going to end up with this person? RATH: Remember all those questions Erica Rex had to answer before her session about voices in the TV and coded messages? Those were meant to screen out people who might have trouble. But Hanson says questions like that aren't foolproof. Charles Grob is at UCLA, and he's one of the few researchers actually studying medical uses of psychedelic drugs. Even he agrees there are reasons to be cautious but thinks federal regulations are still too strict. CHARLES GROB: Our work, we feel we've demonstrated very good safety, as have the other researchers in the field. Where the risks come in are in a recreational setting where naive individuals who really don't know what they're getting into take it under adverse conditions, often mix it with alcohol or other drugs. That's where you have the serious potential for adverse outcome. RATH: Can we talk about the current regulations with research on these drugs? What sort of restrictions are there? What sort of hoops do you have to jump through? GROB: For starters, you have to go through FDA. You then have to go through the DEA. And then in California, we have our own kind of instate oversight body that looks at all research with Schedule 1 drugs, and that's the Research Advisory Panel of California. So many hoops to jump through. To work in this area, one has to be very patient. RATH: You talked about how thanks to Timothy Leary and folks like that there have been kind of a stigma. Does that persist? Is it difficult to get funding? GROB: Well, it's - funding is very challenging. It has not been possible to get funding from the National Institutes of Health, at least up to now, for funding these kinds of projects. Hopefully that will change and hopefully in the near future there may be some opportunity to see some progress in that arena. But up to now, all of our funding has come from private sources, which is, at times, particularly in a difficult economy, a difficult task. RATH: Despite the difficulty finding funding, Charles Grob and others are pressing on. GROB: I think we need to recognize the '60s are over. They're long gone. Timothy Leary is dead. Moody Blues sang that a long time ago when he wasn't dead but now he really is dead. He's off the stage. And I believe we're on the threshold of some very exciting discoveries that the health field can only benefit from. RATH: Grob has been approved to begin a new study next month using the drug ecstasy to treat social anxiety in adults with autism. Timothy Leary may be dead, but a new debate over the use of psychedelics is just getting started.

But as much as the psychedelic experience helped her, some authorities say there are significant questions about whether they are safe and effective for everyone. Glen Hanson is a senior adviser for the National Institute on Drug Abuse. GLEN HANSON: I think there still needs to be an asterisk next to it. I don't think that it looks like a brand-new antidepressant. There are enough people who've gotten into trouble with these things. And we know that there's this lack of predictability. RATH: Hanson says the main problem with hallucinogens is that they affect people in wildly different ways. HANSON: There are people who get into trouble with these drugs. Usually, these are folks who have emotional disturbances already in place and you superimpose - like an LSD - on someone that's a schizophrenic, and you don't know what you're going to get. Because that's almost the definition of hallucinogens is you go in and you scramble the chemistry of the brain. And if it's already \"scrambled\" - again I put that in quotation marks - but if it's already abnormal, where are you going to end up with this person? RATH: Remember all those questions Erica Rex had to answer before her session about voices in the TV and coded messages? Those were meant to screen out people who might have trouble. But Hanson says questions like that aren't foolproof. Charles Grob is at UCLA, and he's one of the few researchers actually studying medical uses of psychedelic drugs. Even he agrees there are reasons to be cautious but thinks federal regulations are still too strict. CHARLES GROB: Our work, we feel we've demonstrated very good safety, as have the other researchers in the field. Where the risks come in are in a recreational setting where naive individuals who really don't know what they're getting into take it under adverse conditions, often mix it with alcohol or other drugs. That's where you have the serious potential for adverse outcome. RATH: Can we talk about the current regulations with research on these drugs? What sort of restrictions are there? What sort of hoops do you have to jump through? GROB: For starters, you have to go through FDA. You then have to go through the DEA. And then in California, we have our own kind of instate oversight body that looks at all research with Schedule 1 drugs, and that's the Research Advisory Panel of California. So many hoops to jump through. To work in this area, one has to be very patient. RATH: You talked about how thanks to Timothy Leary and folks like that there have been kind of a stigma. Does that persist? Is it difficult to get funding? GROB: Well, it's - funding is very challenging. It has not been possible to get funding from the National Institutes of Health, at least up to now, for funding these kinds of projects. Hopefully that will change and hopefully in the near future there may be some opportunity to see some progress in that arena. But up to now, all of our funding has come from private sources, which is, at times, particularly in a difficult economy, a difficult task. RATH: Despite the difficulty finding funding, Charles Grob and others are pressing on. GROB: I think we need to recognize the '60s are over. They're long gone. Timothy Leary is dead. Moody Blues sang that a long time ago when he wasn't dead but now he really is dead. He's off the stage. And I believe we're on the threshold of some very exciting discoveries that the health field can only benefit from. RATH: Grob has been approved to begin a new study next month using the drug ecstasy to treat social anxiety in adults with autism. Timothy Leary may be dead, but a new debate over the use of psychedelics is just getting started.

I'm Robert Siegel. MELISSA BLOCK, HOST: And I'm Melissa Block. Getting your entire genetic code deciphered is the cutting edge of medicine. The test to spell out every letter in one's genetic blueprint can be done quickly and has become relatively inexpensive. That's raising the question: Is the technology ready for primetime? NPR's Rob Stein joins us now to talk about one of the first carefully done studies aimed at answering that question. And, Rob, why don't you back up first and explain just what it means to decipher somebody's entire genetic code? ROB STEIN, BYLINE: Yeah, Melissa. As we know, our genetic code is what makes us who we are. It's made up of more than 3 billion chemical letters that carry the coding for more than 20,000 genes. The first time anyone deciphered the entire genetic code, it took nearly a decade - hundreds of scientists working for nearly a decade - and cost about $3 billion. Today, it can be done in just days, and it can cost as little as about $5,000. So some doctors have started to use this in medicine, and some are recommending that maybe we should do it on everybody as part of routine medical care. BLOCK: Some are recommending that but not all. This is a controversial idea, right? STEIN: That's right. That's right. Some say, look, this is the future of medicine, the future of what we call personalized medicine. You could produce lots of really valuable information about whether we're at risk for certain diseases, what drugs work best for us, what we should eat. But others say, look, right now, it would just produce a flood of confusing, vague information that would end up scaring people unnecessarily and then forcing them to get all sorts of tests and procedures. It could end up being expensive and do more harm than good. BLOCK: And that was the idea behind this study that I mentioned, trying to figure out the reality here. Tell us about the study, how it worked and what they found. STEIN: Right. This group at Stanford, they've decided to sequence 12 healthy people using two different methods to basically see how well it would work and what they'd find out and how much it would cost. And what they found was that on the positive side, you know, it did produce some very useful information. It determined that some of the people were at risk for certain diseases like diabetes and heart disease. One woman even found out that she was at high risk for ovarian cancer and breast cancer and was able to take some steps to protect herself. On the negative side, the researchers determined that the two different versions that they used produced very different results and conflicting information, which is a really big red flag that indicated that often these testing will produce a lot of incorrect information that would scare people unnecessarily and also reassure them in ways that wasn't true. Also, it ends up costing about $17,000 once you added up all the costs of the testing, the analysis, the follow-up exams. And it took an enormous amount of time - about 100 hours for each patient. BLOCK: Is that cost ever covered by health insurance? STEIN: You know, right now, it generally isn't. It's only covered in very specific situations where somebody is using it for a specific medical purpose, like for somebody who has a mysterious condition that nobody can diagnose or for a cancer patient, perhaps, trying to figure out if there's a better drug they should take. BLOCK: Well, in the end, Rob, where does this leave things? Does whole genome sequencing have a place in medicine or anytime soon? Or is that still quite a ways down the road? STEIN: You know, the current thinking, I think, among most experts is that, yes, it's clearly very exciting technology that will play a very important role in medicine. And for those specific patients that I mentioned, people who have a specific reason to have it done, like a cancer patient looking for a better drug, or somebody who's on what they call a diagnostic odyssey where nobody can figure out what's wrong with them - for them, it can be very useful. But a lot of people think, you know, we're not quite there yet. We have to get a lot better at doing the analysis and doing the sequencing and really knowing whether it will have useful information for most people. BLOCK: So the idea of going in to your doctor, getting a flu shot and, oh, by the way, do you want to get your genome sequenced, no time soon. STEIN: Yeah. Well, you know, it can be done right now. You can sign up and get what's called getting your exome sequence, which is not the entire genome but all the genes that we know about. And some people are doing this. But most people, I think, would say right now that for the general population, we still got a ways to go before it becomes routine. BLOCK: OK. NPR's Rob Stein. Rob, thanks so much.

The Arctic birds usually winter in Southern Canada, but this year they've been spotted as far south as Florida. As NPR's Adam Cole reports, scientists are taking advantage of this unexpected visit by equipping a few of the owls with GPS tracking devices. ADAM COLE, BYLINE: It's a chilly winter evening on the coast of Maryland, but naturalist Scott Weidensaul and two volunteers are taking a walk on the beach. One of the volunteers cradles a pigeon. SCOTT WEIDENSAUL: Looks like the lunatics have escaped the asylum here. He's taking his pet pigeon for a walk and I'm walking around with a giant mouse trap over my arm. COLE: That giant mousetrap actually looks more like a hockey goal, a light frame that supports a loose netting. It's designed to harmlessly capture large birds of prey and the pigeon is the bait. It will sit at the center of the trap wearing a sturdy leather jacket to protect it from piercing talons. A few hundred yards away there's a bright patch of white perched on the crest of a dune, a large female snowy owl. Weidensaul hopes she's hungry. WEIDENSAUL: That's kind of a typical, I'm-getting-ready-to-hunt perch. COLE: He sets up the trap as stealthily as he can and then he waits for the owl to strike. Like most birders, Weidensaul was surprised when snowy owls suddenly started showing up in the United States, mostly in the North and the East, around Thanksgiving. WEIDENSAUL: There was no preliminary. They're just suddenly, there were snowy owls everywhere. And actually I got a call from Dave. COLE: That's Dave Brinker, a biologist with the Maryland Department of Natural Resources. WEIDENSAUL: Who said this obviously more than just the typical every three to five year irruption. COLE: That's irruption with an I. It means a sudden increase in the abundance of a species. This year's snowy owl irruption wasn't caused by the bouts of freezing weather we've been having or by climate change. It was caused by lemmings. Owls eat lemmings and Dave Brinker says when there are more lemmings, the owls have more babies. DAVE BRINKER: When they get a big lemming high, they can lay up to 14 eggs and that's what happened this summer. COLE: Huge numbers of owlets hatched and come winter they spread far to the south. BRINKER: And that's when Scott and I got on the phone and said, we need to take advantage of this opportunity 'cause we won't see something like this for a long time, probably in the rest of our lifetime. COLE: So Brinker and Weidensaul launched Project Snowstorm, their goal to tag as many owls as possible with GPS transmitters. By studying the owls' movements - for example, the fact that they hang out at airports, the scientists hope to better understand their behavior and protect them from hazards. In less than two weeks, Project Snowstorm managed to cobble together a national team of volunteers and $20,000 in donations. Which brings us back to that Maryland beach where Weidensaul has been waiting for more than an hour. WEIDENSAUL: Here she comes, here she comes, here she comes. COLE: The big female owl launches herself at the trap, hovers above it for just a moment and then flies back to her perch. After another half hour she flies inland and out of sight. WEIDENSAUL: After all that. And the next time somebody quotes Dave Brinker to me that anything worth doing is never easy, I'm going to hit them. COLE: But further down the beach, another birder, Steve Huy, does manage to catch an owl. STEVE HUY: This is very large. It's a female, pretty good size. COLE: Like many members of Project Snowstorm, Huy isn't a professional ornithologist. HUY: I'm an analyst for Marriott International. COLE: But he is specially trained and permitted to catch owls. Huy and Brinker measure the big female's wingspan, tail length, fat stores and then they take a blood sample. The owl is surprisingly calm, but every so often she voices her disapproval. HUY: She says, oh, you've got cold fingers. COLE: And sometimes she shows her disapproval with her beak. HUY: Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow. Man, that hurts. COLE: Then comes the GPS transmitter. It's a small light box that fits easily in the palm of your hand and it's equipped with a solar panel and a chip that can hold five years worth of data. The owl wears it like a backpack with two thin Teflon straps wrapping around her wings. Brinker carefully sews the straps by hand so they fit the owl's frame and don't interfere with flight. BRINKER: At first they're going to notice it, but they get used to it pretty quick. COLE: As soon as the transmitter is snug, the owl is released on the beach where she was caught. Are there any solemn words spoken on a time like this? BRINKER: This is a high tech owl so we'll use \"Star Trek. \" Live long and prosper. COLE: The owl takes off, gliding out into the dunes. Already her GPS unit is collecting data - longitude, latitude and altitude every half hour, and every three days her transmitter and the transmitters of the other 15 owls tagged so far will connect to a cell phone network and send all their data back to Project Snowstorm. BRINKER: We're all sitting there, 7 o'clock every third day. It's like, you know, come on, who's checking in? And look where that bird went. COLE: You can follow all the tagged owls on the Project Snowstorm website. The big female tagged on Maryland's coast has already started her journey back up to the Arctic Circle. At last check-in she was hunting in a Pennsylvania field. Adam Cole, NPR News. GREENE: This is NPR News.

So here's a joke. A man sitting on the veranda with his wife one night when out of the blue he says: I love you. His wife says: Was that you or was that the beer talking? The man says: That was me talking to the beer. Maybe you found that funny. I find it hysterical. What makes a joke funny is a question that has beset the human condition since we lost our tails and started walking upright. But, can scientists tell us today why we laugh? Scott Weems is a cognitive neuroscientist and the author of the book, \"Ha! The Science of When We Laugh and Why. \" And he joins us from member station KUAR in Little Rock, Arkansas. Thanks for being with us, Scott Weems. SCOTT WEEMS: Thank you very much for having me. LYDEN: Tell me a joke and let's break it down a little bit, would you? WEEMS: Sure. I should warn you though, as a scientist I'm not trained very well to tell jokes, but I'll do my best. LYDEN: All right. WEEMS: So a dog walks in a telegraph office and he says I want to send a message. And the operator says, \"Sure what would you like to send? \" And the dog says, \"Woof woof woof woof woof woof woof woof woof. \" And the operator pauses a second and goes, \"You know, that's only nine. You can send a 10th woof for free. \" And the dog replies, \"But that would make no sense. \" People never laugh when I tell that joke. LYDEN: I'm giggling. I'm giggling here. WEEMS: Thank you. I wouldn't hold it against you if you didn't. LYDEN: All right. I'm kind of getting my comedy writing sketch part here, but you're a neuroscientist. What makes it funny? WEEMS: There is one part of the brain that's worth recognizing and it's called the anterior cingulate. It's not on the surface. It's a little below and it's what we consider our conflict detector. LYDEN: Um-hum. WEEMS: Anytime we're confused or overwhelmed or just we have conflicting information like in the form of a surprising punch line, this area gets very active. LYDEN: Why is conflict important in a joke? WEEMS: It's basically how we process things we don't understand. I mean, so much of our life is filled with conflict, and not just jokes. I mean, people laugh at funerals, people laugh at tragic events, and it's because these are time when we just don't know how else to respond. I mean, humor is much broader than just a standup routine. It's just how we look at these moments in life where things don't make sense. LYDEN: So laughter is coping, bonding, lessening anxiety, the sense of discovery, surprise; all these things. WEEMS: It is and I think that's why it's so linked with health benefits as well. LYDEN: Now, humor hasn't always been looked upon so positively. You write that Plato and Jesus weren't funny. WEEMS: No. I mean, it's really a shame. Historically, humor has not gotten a good rap. Someone actually counted the number of times that laughter occurred in the Old Testament. The total number is 29 and of those only two are positive. In other words, only two are occasions of joy. Well, there's debates now whether Jesus laughed, not just in the New Testament, but in his whole life. And, of course, Plato, Hobbs, Nietzsche, these scholars all have very negative views towards humor 'cause they saw it as something that weak minds did. It's not something that serious people do. LYDEN: Do you think men and women tell jokes differently? WEEMS: They do. It turns out that women laugh more than men, but they're much less successful in the world if comedy. Or at least there are fewer professional female comedians, which is - it's a shame. And people have wondered why is this? Because it's certainly not that women have less of a sense of humor. And one evolutionary theory is that the men are raised, and maybe even have an evolutionary benefit to being the funny people in relationships. We men make women laugh because it's a sign of genetic fitness. A man who can make his partner laugh is more likely to be intelligent and a good caregiver. And that's also why women consistently rate sense of humor as No. 1 desired trait in a mate. For men, sometimes it's closer to No. 3, after intelligence and good looks. So women maybe aren't given the benefits and the encouragement to be as funny as they could or should be. LYDEN: You want leave us with one last joke? WEEMS: Oh, my. OK, I have had bad success with this in the past but I will give it a try. Two fish are swimming in a tank and one looks to the other and he says: Do you know how to drive this thing? LYDEN: Scott Weems is a cognitive neuroscientist and the author of \"Ha! The Science of When We Laugh and Why. \" He joined us from Little Rock, Arkansas. Thank you for joining us.

LYDEN: Tell me a joke and let's break it down a little bit, would you? WEEMS: Sure. I should warn you though, as a scientist I'm not trained very well to tell jokes, but I'll do my best. LYDEN: All right. WEEMS: So a dog walks in a telegraph office and he says I want to send a message. And the operator says, \"Sure what would you like to send? \" And the dog says, \"Woof woof woof woof woof woof woof woof woof. \" And the operator pauses a second and goes, \"You know, that's only nine. You can send a 10th woof for free. \" And the dog replies, \"But that would make no sense. \" People never laugh when I tell that joke. LYDEN: I'm giggling. I'm giggling here. WEEMS: Thank you. I wouldn't hold it against you if you didn't. LYDEN: All right. I'm kind of getting my comedy writing sketch part here, but you're a neuroscientist. What makes it funny? WEEMS: There is one part of the brain that's worth recognizing and it's called the anterior cingulate. It's not on the surface. It's a little below and it's what we consider our conflict detector. LYDEN: Um-hum. WEEMS: Anytime we're confused or overwhelmed or just we have conflicting information like in the form of a surprising punch line, this area gets very active. LYDEN: Why is conflict important in a joke? WEEMS: It's basically how we process things we don't understand. I mean, so much of our life is filled with conflict, and not just jokes. I mean, people laugh at funerals, people laugh at tragic events, and it's because these are time when we just don't know how else to respond. I mean, humor is much broader than just a standup routine. It's just how we look at these moments in life where things don't make sense. LYDEN: So laughter is coping, bonding, lessening anxiety, the sense of discovery, surprise; all these things. WEEMS: It is and I think that's why it's so linked with health benefits as well. LYDEN: Now, humor hasn't always been looked upon so positively. You write that Plato and Jesus weren't funny. WEEMS: No. I mean, it's really a shame. Historically, humor has not gotten a good rap. Someone actually counted the number of times that laughter occurred in the Old Testament. The total number is 29 and of those only two are positive. In other words, only two are occasions of joy. Well, there's debates now whether Jesus laughed, not just in the New Testament, but in his whole life. And, of course, Plato, Hobbs, Nietzsche, these scholars all have very negative views towards humor 'cause they saw it as something that weak minds did. It's not something that serious people do. LYDEN: Do you think men and women tell jokes differently? WEEMS: They do. It turns out that women laugh more than men, but they're much less successful in the world if comedy. Or at least there are fewer professional female comedians, which is - it's a shame. And people have wondered why is this? Because it's certainly not that women have less of a sense of humor. And one evolutionary theory is that the men are raised, and maybe even have an evolutionary benefit to being the funny people in relationships. We men make women laugh because it's a sign of genetic fitness. A man who can make his partner laugh is more likely to be intelligent and a good caregiver. And that's also why women consistently rate sense of humor as No. 1 desired trait in a mate. For men, sometimes it's closer to No. 3, after intelligence and good looks. So women maybe aren't given the benefits and the encouragement to be as funny as they could or should be. LYDEN: You want leave us with one last joke? WEEMS: Oh, my. OK, I have had bad success with this in the past but I will give it a try. Two fish are swimming in a tank and one looks to the other and he says: Do you know how to drive this thing? LYDEN: Scott Weems is a cognitive neuroscientist and the author of \"Ha! The Science of When We Laugh and Why. \" He joined us from Little Rock, Arkansas. Thank you for joining us. WEEMS: Thank you very much for having me.

That is the consensus of investigators still struggling to understand what happened to Malaysia Airlines flight 370. Today, the Malaysian defense minister announced the authorities were refocusing their investigation on all crew and passengers. Last week, Interpol confirmed that two passengers aboard the flight were traveling on stolen passports. While there's no evidence that those passengers are behind the plane's disappearance, aviation experts say it highlights a major security gap at many airports. It is still possible to board an airplane with a fake photo ID. How could that be the case? A new study of facial recognition finds that people are shockingly bad at picking out fake photo IDs. Megan Papesh is one of the authors of that study. MEGAN PAPESH: When you are tasked with matching somebody to a photo ID that had been taken days, months, even years prior, all of the many changes that occur in people - gain weight, lose weight, shave, put on glasses - you know, myriad changes occur, and that makes people really willing to accept a lot of changes. RATH: So how did you do the study? How did you take a look at this? PAPESH: We took pictures of students at Arizona State University and got their permission to download their student ID photos. And then at Louisiana State University, we presented those photos to students and asked them to make - basically match mismatched decisions to those where we manipulated how frequently we showed them IDs that mismatched. So those are the critical ones. Those are the bad guys. RATH: Mm-hmm. And how often did they get it wrong? PAPESH: Well, when they see the mismatches frequently - so that's 50 percent of the time - they would get it wrong about 20 percent of the time. So they would be about 80 percent accurate. But when they only saw the mismatches 10 percent of the time, their error rates actually skyrocketed. They went up to 45 percent. RATH: Just for some real-world examples, say, if you're a bouncer at a bar, you're checking IDs, are you more or less likely to get those right compared to other situations? PAPESH: That situation's actually really interesting. So a lot of my research assistants have told me that bouncers at clubs are really good at spotting fake IDs despite the motivation to let people in and sell alcohol to them because they encounter so many of them, which is part of why we're interested in providing training to individuals who are tasked with doing this in more security contexts with those bursts of fake IDs, kind of like they would get if they were bouncers at a club. RATH: So TSA agents could learn something from the bouncer community. PAPESH: I hesitate to put them on that spot, but it's possible. (LAUGHTER)RATH: Potentially. And in terms of the ID itself, is there anything that could be done with that or photographic techniques that could make them less fallible? PAPESH: Well, I hear for passport photos, you have to put your hair behind your ears if you have long hair because most people don't change their ears. But driver's licenses don't have those sort of constraints. But there are some researchers in the U. K. that have found that having multiple photos of the same person helps people identify faces to photographs. RATH: You know, I know that we know from computer modeling that facial recognition is extremely complicated. And your work would seem to indicate that humans actually aren't as good at it as we might have thought we were. Is this simply a bad way to identify people? PAPESH: Unfortunately, it's simultaneously the best and the worst way that we have. Computer face recognition software is making tremendous strides. But unfortunately, that software doesn't perform at the level of humans yet, so it can't be deployed in applied contexts. And barring anything much more invasive, like retinal scans or thumbprint ID, face matching is really the best way to go without being too terribly invasive.

But they also have qualities that make them more similar to you and me than you might think. NPR's Joe Palca has a story that reveals that quite dramatically. Joe's been immersed in an NPR series called Joe's Big Idea, where he explores the minds and motivations of scientists and inventors. And from time to time, he drops by to share some of the interesting things he's learned. Hi, Joe. JOE PALCA, BYLINE: Hi, Rachel. MARTIN: So, what's the story? PALCA: Well, this is a story that an astrophysicist named Don Winget told me when I interviewed him in his office at the University of Texas at Austin. And the story takes place in the 1980s and it involves Winget and another astrophysicist named Icko Iben. Now, at the time, Iben was, you know, a senior person in the field and Don was the young upstart just getting started. But Winget came up with this really interesting way of measuring the age of the universe using something called white dwarf stars. And he got some really startling results. The universe was much younger than people though. So, he wrote up a paper about his work and submitted it to a science journal, but then he doesn't hear anything for a while. MARTIN: OK. PALCA: And then one day. . . DON WINGET: My phone rings. I recognize the voice. It's Icko on the other end. Don? Yeah, hi, Icko. Come to my office. OK. MARTIN: OK. Sounds daunting. PALCA: Yeah, I love that. OK. Anyway, so, he says come to my office. But the thing is Don's in Austin, Texas and Icko's at the University of Illinois in Champaign. So, he jumps on a plane and flies to Illinois and goes to Icko's office. . . WINGET: Knock on the door and he says come in, Don. Holy crap. Scared me, you know. And so I go in, and he says, shut the door. And I shut the door. And he starts yelling at me and yelling at me, and this yelling goes on for honest and true probably almost 30 minutes. He's yelling at me. I mean, realistically probably 10, but you know. MARTIN: Yelling? Did he have any idea why this is happening? PALCA: Well, yeah. And so you'll hear the answer. But you have to understand that Don and Icko are friends and so he's a little taken aback by this. But Don told me why Icko was yelling at him. WINGET: He said you understand, Don, that I'm refereeing your paper. MARTIN: Refereeing - wait. I don't understand what that means. PALCA: OK. So, when a scientist sends a paper into a scientific journal, they ask people to be peer reviewers or referees and the referees decide whether they science was done properly. And then if it was, then the paper gets published. MARTIN: So, this is his friend and he's serving as the referee. PALCA: Exactly. WINGET: He said you understand, Don, that I'm refereeing your paper on the age of the white dwarfs and the age of the universe. And he said and I'm really mad because it's right. PALCA: It's right. Yeah. So, what does that mean? Why would he be mad if the data is right? Well, here is how Don characterized what Icko had to say. WINGET: Well, I reproduced your calculations and I completely agree - they're right. And so I'm going to recommend that you publish this. But I want you to realize that everybody that's worked in this field are going to hate your guts because you've just turned over their entire life's work. MARTIN: Wow. PALCA: So, what Icko's doing is he's preparing Don for what's about to happen. Because Don has come out with this paper that says the universe is about 10 or 11 billion years old, and everybody else in the field at the time is saying the universe is saying 20 or 30 billion years old. And now these people, the ones who were saying it was much older, have to go back to the drawing board and everything they've done has to be rethought. MARTIN: But isn't that how science works, Joe? PALCA: Well, yeah, it is. But that doesn't mean that scientists won't start kicking and screaming about this. And that's what Don was pointing out to me. WINGET: I didn't think that would happen. I thought, well, scientists, we're all objective, but we're not. We're people. In the end we're objective but it doesn't mean we don't scream and yell. And we have enormous biases in everything we do. And we try to overcome those. But a lot of times it takes time and perseverance and the collective efforts of the community. PALCA: Now, it did come out he was right and the field changed. Although he wasn't exactly right. MARTIN: But it's also a little bit scary as the layperson listening to this because you'd like to think that scientists are those rational beings who are not stuck in the muck of emotion like the rest of us. Because they are the ones who are supposed to be disseminating things that are black and white, right and wrong. PALCA: Well, not black and white. But they are usually able to move the ball forward with some new findings. But if that new information is skewering somebody else's old information, it can lead to some really passionate moments. MARTIN: They are just as emotional as the rest of us. PALCA: Basically, yes. (LAUGHTER)MARTIN: NPR's science correspondent Joe Palca. Thanks so much, Joe. PALCA: You're welcome.

I'm Audie Cornish. ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: And I'm Robert Siegel. Listen to this. DION MCGREGOR: The horse she grabbed came out and peeked. Only peeked and then winked. SIEGEL: Would you say that this speaker is A, reading a poem, B, out of his mind or C, asleep. MCGREGOR: How are those waves? Yes, those waves, dark waves, lowering clouds, horseshoe crabs. It was all very, very timorous. SIEGEL: We're told that the answer is C, asleep. This is a recording of the late Dion McGregor a famed sleep talker. MCGREGOR: (Unintelligible)SIEGEL: This spring, a posthumous recording of Mr. McGregor will be released. Dion McGregor whose name is spelled like Dion, died in 1994. He was in his '70s, a man who was, by one description, a gay Bohemian drifter and endearing freeloader. He wrote song lyrics, most notably he and his roommate, Michael Barr, wrote a Barbra Streisand song called \"Where Is The Wonder? \". (SOUNDBITE FROM SONG \"WHERE IS THE WONDER? \")SIEGEL: Dion McGregor also became an unusual if not unique recording artist. Michael Barr said that McGregor engaged in extensive somniloquies, bursts of sleep talking that sometimes went on for a few minutes at a stretch. Barr recorded them and 50 years ago, Decca released an LP of those recordings. The album was called \"The Dream World of Dion McGregor (He Talks In His Sleep). \" There was also a book. MCGREGOR: Turn around, turn around. Spin that Lazy Susan and everybody takes what they want on it. All right. Turn it, grab it, grab, grab, grab. We're playing food roulette. Food roulette. We have a poisoned eclair on there and somebody's going to get it. We don't know which one is the poisoned eclair. Spin, spin, spin, spin the Lazy Susan. Spin it, spin it, spin it, spin it, spin it, spin it, spin it. Is everybody lined up? Everybody line up to get their eclair. SIEGEL: Over the years, a couple of other McGregor's sleep-talk recordings have been released. The forthcoming one has an introduction by a Harvard Medical School psychologist and frankly, upon listening to several of these recordings, I was both surprised and skeptical so we ran them past a sleep researcher who happens to be another Harvard Med School psychologist and we asked what did he make of them. So here we are joined by two Harvard Med School psychologists. First, Dr. Deirdre Barrett who is contributing the new introduction. Welcome to the program. DEIRDRE BARRETT: Hi there. SIEGEL: And Dr. Robert Stickgold. ROBERT STICKGOLD: Pleasure to be here. SIEGEL: Let's hear from Dr. Barrett first. In a journal article that you wrote about this, you talked about sleep talk and observed that it ranges from simple monosyllabic utterances to episodes over a hundred words. The typical duration is a few seconds. These run on so much longer than that. What is going on here? BARRETT: Well, it's at the high end ever recorded. Actually, A. M. Arkin did a lot of laboratory research on sleep talking and he had some talkers who went on as long as Dion McGregor, all of whom seemed to be talking in a sort of a hybrid almost REM sleep, but showing a bit more waking signs in their EEG so he assumed that Dion McGregor was in that category of sleep talkers. SIEGEL: Dr. Stickgold, we asked you to listen to some of these. What do you hear? STICKGOLD: I hear very entertaining monologues and I actually question whether they could be actual dream reports. I don't think they can be from REM sleep because we're paralyzed when we're in REM sleep and sleepwalking and sleep talking normally come from non-REM sleep. So they're also so much more coherent than dream reports usually are. And I clocked one of them going on for 10 minutes and I don't know, Deirdre, did you know dream reports that stay on topic that long? BARRETT: I'm not calling them dream reports. I'm saying that they seemed to be sleep talking from a sort of atypical REM stage. And one of the most interesting things that Arkin found in his research was that when he would tape people sleep talking for a long time and then awaken them, when he did that in REM, you know, we'd, commonsense wise, want to think that they're recounting the dream. And if you wake them up and ask them what they were dreaming, it would be very, very similar. In some cases, it bore no detectable relationship to what they'd just been saying so it's not like their dream accounts, but I do suspect they're coming from this sort of atypical REM sleep. SIEGEL: You would say, Dr. Stickgold, not just atypical. You would say impossible for REM sleep. STICKGOLD: Not impossible, but very unlikely. It would require an atypical physiology. He's got more consistency and coherence than I've ever seen. He's got one that's called the scavenger hunt. MCGREGOR: First one on there, a yellow robin's egg. Second one, a wolf's dream. Third, a Welsh shoelace. Fourth, a dirty napkin used by Garbo. STICKGOLD: He lists 16 items that people are supposed to go out and find in a scavenger hunt. I've never heard - and I've listened to thousands of them. I've never heard a dream report that can go on for six for seven minutes in that case just listing things without drifting off topic. SIEGEL: Dr. Barrett, what do you make of that phenomenon? BARRETT: Well, we had the whole almost 600 transcripts and not surprisingly, Steve Venwright and the previous people to do these CDs have taken some of the most interesting story-like coherent of the narratives. It's still true that his sleep talking, in general, has more of a narrative sense than many sleep talkers, but the ones on the recordings, they're simply the most entertaining. SIEGEL: How do you regard these recordings when obviously there's a limited amount of recording of people talking in their sleep out there. This was not done under scientific supervision. It's done by two guys in show business. How do you deal with that as scientific evidence? BARRETT: Well, I think it's fascinating that we have this from back in the 1950s when it was recorded, but I think this is just changing overnight. There's at least one app for phones out there that activate when you speak during the night and record your sleep talking and websites for sharing, you know, people's favorite snippets of sleep talking. So I think we're in the process of having just infinitely more access to that, but it's nice to have some from 50 years ago. STICKGOLD: I mean, at the risk being deluged with emails - so I was telling Robert to send them to you instead of me. You know, hello, are there people out there who have bed partners who sound like this in their sleep? Because if they do, we'd love to get them into the lab and turn it into science. SIEGEL: Let me ask both of you just in a way to wrap up here, if you could put a single question to Dion McGregor, were he still alive, what would you ask him? What would you want to find out? First of all, Robert Stickgold. STICKGOLD: I'd ask him if he'd spend the night with me, but in my sleep lab. I'd love to see what his sleep looks like if we recorded it, you know, with EEG electrodes and everything to monitor this sleep because if it's a real as it might be, and it might be, then it'd be a novel and important finding. SIEGEL: Deirdre Barrett, what would you want to know? BARRETT: I'd want to ask him things out of his sleep. I'd want to wake him up multiple times in the midst of it to get whether he was having a dreamlike experience that corresponded to it or whether two different parts of his brain were just doing parallel things at the same time. SIEGEL: Well, alas, none of us will have that opportunity. But Dr. Stickgold, you've made a very interesting suggestion to our listeners, that if somebody can send us a recording of, as you say, a sleep partner whose sleep talk comes anything close to what they've heard from these Dion McGregor recordings, we'll listen to them. STICKGOLD: That'd be great fun. SIEGEL: Well, I'd like to thank both of you. Dr. Deirdre Barrett and Dr. Robert Stickgold, thanks for talking with us. STICKGOLD: Great pleasure. BARRETT: It's been fun. SIEGEL: We've been talking about the somniloquies of the late Dion McGregor. The upcoming album of those somniloquies, which were originally released 50 years ago, is called \"Dreaming Like Mad with Dion McGregor. \"MCGREGOR: We have tongues wag in this town. Tongues wag. They do. CORNISH: You're listening to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:  From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Audie Cornish. ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:  And I'm Robert Siegel. Listen to this. DION MCGREGOR: The horse she grabbed came out and peeked. Only peeked and then winked. SIEGEL: Would you say that this speaker is A, reading a poem, B, out of his mind or C, asleep. MCGREGOR: How are those waves? Yes, those waves, dark waves, lowering clouds, horseshoe crabs. It was all very, very timorous. SIEGEL: We're told that the answer is C, asleep. This is a recording of the late Dion McGregor a famed sleep talker. MCGREGOR: (Unintelligible) SIEGEL: This spring, a posthumous recording of Mr. McGregor will be released. Dion McGregor whose name is spelled like Dion, died in 1994. He was in his '70s, a man who was, by one description, a gay Bohemian drifter and endearing freeloader. He wrote song lyrics, most notably he and his roommate, Michael Barr, wrote a Barbra Streisand song called \"Where Is The Wonder? \". (SOUNDBITE FROM SONG \"WHERE IS THE WONDER? \") SIEGEL: Dion McGregor also became an unusual if not unique recording artist. Michael Barr said that McGregor engaged in extensive somniloquies, bursts of sleep talking that sometimes went on for a few minutes at a stretch. Barr recorded them and 50 years ago, Decca released an LP of those recordings. The album was called \"The Dream World of Dion McGregor (He Talks In His Sleep). \" There was also a book. MCGREGOR: Turn around, turn around. Spin that Lazy Susan and everybody takes what they want on it. All right. Turn it, grab it, grab, grab, grab. We're playing food roulette. Food roulette. We have a poisoned eclair on there and somebody's going to get it. We don't know which one is the poisoned eclair. Spin, spin, spin, spin the Lazy Susan. Spin it, spin it, spin it, spin it, spin it, spin it, spin it. Is everybody lined up? Everybody line up to get their eclair. SIEGEL: Over the years, a couple of other McGregor's sleep-talk recordings have been released. The forthcoming one has an introduction by a Harvard Medical School psychologist and frankly, upon listening to several of these recordings, I was both surprised and skeptical so we ran them past a sleep researcher who happens to be another Harvard Med School psychologist and we asked what did he make of them. So here we are joined by two Harvard Med School psychologists. First, Dr. Deirdre Barrett who is contributing the new introduction. Welcome to the program. DEIRDRE BARRETT: Hi there. SIEGEL: And Dr. Robert Stickgold. ROBERT STICKGOLD: Pleasure to be here. SIEGEL: Let's hear from Dr. Barrett first. In a journal article that you wrote about this, you talked about sleep talk and observed that it ranges from simple monosyllabic utterances to episodes over a hundred words. The typical duration is a few seconds. These run on so much longer than that. What is going on here? BARRETT: Well, it's at the high end ever recorded. Actually, A. M. Arkin did a lot of laboratory research on sleep talking and he had some talkers who went on as long as Dion McGregor, all of whom seemed to be talking in a sort of a hybrid almost REM sleep, but showing a bit more waking signs in their EEG so he assumed that Dion McGregor was in that category of sleep talkers. SIEGEL: Dr. Stickgold, we asked you to listen to some of these. What do you hear? STICKGOLD: I hear very entertaining monologues and I actually question whether they could be actual dream reports. I don't think they can be from REM sleep because we're paralyzed when we're in REM sleep and sleepwalking and sleep talking normally come from non-REM sleep. So they're also so much more coherent than dream reports usually are. And I clocked one of them going on for 10 minutes and I don't know, Deirdre, did you know dream reports that stay on topic that long? BARRETT: I'm not calling them dream reports. I'm saying that they seemed to be sleep talking from a sort of atypical REM stage. And one of the most interesting things that Arkin found in his research was that when he would tape people sleep talking for a long time and then awaken them, when he did that in REM, you know, we'd, commonsense wise, want to think that they're recounting the dream. And if you wake them up and ask them what they were dreaming, it would be very, very similar. In some cases, it bore no detectable relationship to what they'd just been saying so it's not like their dream accounts, but I do suspect they're coming from this sort of atypical REM sleep. SIEGEL: You would say, Dr. Stickgold, not just atypical. You would say impossible for REM sleep. STICKGOLD: Not impossible, but very unlikely. It would require an atypical physiology. He's got more consistency and coherence than I've ever seen. He's got one that's called the scavenger hunt. MCGREGOR: First one on there, a yellow robin's egg. Second one, a wolf's dream. Third, a Welsh shoelace. Fourth, a dirty napkin used by Garbo. STICKGOLD: He lists 16 items that people are supposed to go out and find in a scavenger hunt. I've never heard - and I've listened to thousands of them. I've never heard a dream report that can go on for six for seven minutes in that case just listing things without drifting off topic. SIEGEL: Dr. Barrett, what do you make of that phenomenon? BARRETT: Well, we had the whole almost 600 transcripts and not surprisingly, Steve Venwright and the previous people to do these CDs have taken some of the most interesting story-like coherent of the narratives. It's still true that his sleep talking, in general, has more of a narrative sense than many sleep talkers, but the ones on the recordings, they're simply the most entertaining. SIEGEL: How do you regard these recordings when obviously there's a limited amount of recording of people talking in their sleep out there. This was not done under scientific supervision. It's done by two guys in show business. How do you deal with that as scientific evidence? BARRETT: Well, I think it's fascinating that we have this from back in the 1950s when it was recorded, but I think this is just changing overnight. There's at least one app for phones out there that activate when you speak during the night and record your sleep talking and websites for sharing, you know, people's favorite snippets of sleep talking. So I think we're in the process of having just infinitely more access to that, but it's nice to have some from 50 years ago. STICKGOLD: I mean, at the risk being deluged with emails - so I was telling Robert to send them to you instead of me. You know, hello, are there people out there who have bed partners who sound like this in their sleep? Because if they do, we'd love to get them into the lab and turn it into science.

I'd want to wake him up multiple times in the midst of it to get whether he was having a dreamlike experience that corresponded to it or whether two different parts of his brain were just doing parallel things at the same time.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)BOB EDWARDS: Tomorrow morning, a recycled U. S. satellite will encounter the little-known but very bright Giacobini-Zinner Comet. GREENE: It was the first time a spacecraft had ever visited a comet. Since then, the probe has spent almost three decades on a large, looping orbit around the sun. Its lonely trek will soon bring it close to Earth once again, and NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce reports that one man is on a quest to reconnect with this vintage piece of space hardware. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE, BYLINE: Back in the 1980s, space agencies were racing to be the first to fly by a comet - Halley's Comet, to be precise. But NASA wasn't going because it was too expensive. That did not sit well with a NASA mission designer named Bob Farquhar. He figured out how to divert an existing satellite that was stationed between the Earth and the sun. He came up with a complicated trajectory that would let it intercept a different comet months before the armada of other space probes would arrive at Halley's. BOB FARQUHAR: We beat all the other countries of the world - the European Space Agency, the Russians, the Japanese. GREENFIELDBOYCE: He says he got a congratulatory letter from President Ronald Reagan, though not everyone was amused by the comet caper, like some of the scientists who'd been using that spacecraft, called ISEE-3, to study things like the solar wind. FARQUHAR: And felt like we took the spacecraft away from them too early. They thought that - well, it was in the newspapers, even - that we stole their spacecraft. We didn't steal it. We just borrowed it for a while. That's what I tried to tell them. GREENFIELDBOYCE: After he flew it through the comet's tail, he'd set it on a course that would bring it back, eventually. FARQUHAR: OK. So we took it away in 1983, and you get it back in 2014. How many years is that? Oh, that's about 31 years. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Bob Farquhar is now 81 years old. He's been called the master of getting to places. His genius is inventing esoteric flight plans that take advantage of gravitational boosts from the moon and close flybys of Earth to send space probes zipping around the solar system in surprising ways. He's so adept at calculating these exotic trajectories that often, just for fun, he's made sure that key mission events fall on birthdays or anniversaries. The exploits of ISEE-3 were the first ones to show off what he could do. FARQUHAR: Certainly, all the people in the space business know that that's my spacecraft. It's very personal with me. GREENFIELDBOYCE: His memoir makes it clear how personal. For example, he writes that when he was hospitalized after a heart attack, the spacecraft suffered a battery failure, making him believe they shared a, quote , \"supernatural connection. \"FARQUHAR: It's my baby, yeah. It's something I worked on for a long time, and I had to sell it to NASA, and sell it to a lot of people. GREENFIELDBOYCE: What Farquhar is selling now is the idea of waking up this old satellite and doing what he promised: giving it back. There's a short window in the next few months when it could be commanded to veer close to the moon's surface. The moon's gravity would change its path and basically, make it return it to the spot where it was before it went off chasing comets. One of the people he's convinced is Daniel Baker. DANIEL BAKER: It would not just be a curiosity. It would actually be a useful scientific tool. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Baker is director of the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics at the University of Colorado. He says these days, other satellites monitor space between the Earth and the sun. Still, this one would give them valuable additional measurements. He actually worked on ISEE-3 when he was younger. BAKER: It's not often that something that you've sent off supposedly into oblivion sort of comes back to you; nature brings it back to you. GREENFIELDBOYCE: He says during its long voyage through the vastness of space, this good little robot has presumably just been tending to its business, ready to obey whatever command might come next. He finds it satisfying that without missing a beat, it could go back to the job it was supposed to do when it launched in 1978. BAKER: It really, to me, is a fascinating thing that we can even dream of reassembling the puzzle here and put it back the way, sort of, it was - before Bob stole the spacecraft. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Waking up an old spacecraft like it was Rip Van Winkle is not easy. People have had to dive into archives and pull out old documents to figure out things like, what language does this machine even speak? Not everyone who used to work on this thing is still around. JAMES GREEN: Keith Ogilvie's here. I'm sure he's retired. Smith is retired. Jean-Louis Steinberg, I believe he's retired. GREENFIELDBOYCE: James Green is sitting at NASA headquarters, where he's director of the Planetary Science Division. He's going over a list of the spacecraft's science instruments and the researchers who were in charge of them. GREEN: Bonnard Teegarden, he's retired many years ago. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Another problem: some of the old equipment needed to talk to the spacecraft is just gone. Green says NASA got rid of it. GREEN: Deep-space communication has changed radically over the last 25 years. GREENFIELDBOYCE: But it looks like an 18-meter satellite dish at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory still has the right hardware. GREEN: And so NASA's given them the approval to be able to try that out. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Workers there will see how well they can communicate with the spacecraft and assess its condition. This is still kind of an unofficial effort. NASA hasn't made any firm commitment to this spacecraft, despite Bob Farquhar's relentless lobbying. GREEN: You know, Bob Farquhar is a man of his word. If he said he would do everything he could - because he's borrowed the spacecraft - to put it back, that's what he's going to try to do. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Green says around NASA, this guy's a legend. GREEN: We owe a lot to Bob's creativeness to get our spacecraft in locations that we want them. And so from that perspective, he's really a neat guy, really important in our field. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Well, he knows where he wants this spacecraft. (LAUGHTER)GREEN: Well, wishing doesn't make it so, and we have to at least find the health of the spacecraft before we even make the decision of doing that. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Meanwhile, Bob Farquhar isn't optimistic that it will happen. FARQUHAR: Well, I think the chances are, oh, 50-50. GREENFIELDBOYCE: When he sat down at home to talk about this, he was wearing plaid flannel pajamas and a robe. He wasn't feeling well. Still, he spoke for nearly two hours. FARQUHAR: It's the most cost-effective spacecraft we ever had, and I'd like to make it even more cost-effective. It can do more missions. GREENFIELDBOYCE: But only if a command is sent soon - before late May, or early June. This is his last chance. If the spacecraft's path doesn't change, it will fly by the Earth in August. Its trajectory will bring it back again years from now, but it won't come close enough to be recaptured. Nell Greenfieldboyce, NPR News.

I'm Audie Cornish. ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: And I'm Robert Siegel. CORNISH: On the cover of the April issue of The Atlantic, there's a picture of a boy - he could be six or seven. He's looking to the right toward an adult, whose hand he's holding. He's also wearing a helmet and kneepads. And for further protection, he has a pillow strapped to his torso. The cover art is for Hanna Rosin's article, \"Hey Parents: Leave Those Kids Alone. \" It's about the overprotected child. Hanna Rosin, welcome to the program. HANNA ROSIN: Thank you. SIEGEL: First, I want you to talk about two contradictory facts about parenting statistics about the American parent today. ROSIN: One thing I'm always puzzled over is how it is that we parents, and mothers particularly, spend so much more time at work now than we did in the '70s, than my mother did, for example, and yet we spend a lot more time with our children. I've read that statistic over and over again and just assumed it was a mistake, you know, an oft-repeated mistake. How can that be that my mother, who was home a lot of the time, spent less time with me than I do with my kids? SIEGEL: And the answer is today parents spend a tremendous amount of time with their kids. ROSIN: Yes. I finally thought about it for one second as I was writing the story, and I realized my mother didn't spend time with me. She was home, but she didn't particularly want to see me on a Saturday and I didn't want to see her. And if I contrast that with my life, I'm always with my children all weekend. So the weekends alone probably could make up for the difference. SIEGEL: So what you're writing about is this phenomenon from the children's perspective, which is children are constantly supervised nowadays. ROSIN: Yes. Watched. Watched. They live with the assumption that they will always be watched. They look towards an adult if they need to make any decision, if they need to know whether they should go anywhere. At the playground, they assume they're going to be watched. And so I've never really thought about how that assumption of being watched changes your personality and your experience of childhood. SIEGEL: Not just watched in the playground. The playground has a rubberized ground underneath any climbing apparatus to make sure the child doesn't get injured. Enormous steps have been taken for the safety of this child. ROSIN: Which initially were taken for good reasons. In the '70s, there were certain cases. People were worried about certain dangers in the playground, and that was fine. But what's happened now is we swung way too far in the other direction such that we've become pre-occupied with safety, and that's really having an effect on the culture of childhood so that we're stripping children of their independence, of their ability to take risks, which are key to a happy childhood. SIEGEL: Yeah. This is the core of your article, which is that there is something that is unhelpful to a child to have one's safety be such a concern and so taken care of in so many ways. ROSIN: Yeah. I think we have this assumption now that children can't manage their own risks, that a child does not have the capacity to manage either a physical or an emotional risk unless we step in and manage it for them. But there's something a little bit unnatural about that. I think the process of growing up is the process of learning to manage those fears. When children used to play in playgrounds, they used to do things that felt risky to them. And I said felt risky. That doesn't mean they were dangerous, but they felt dangerous, and then a child's sense of conquering that fear is what allows them to feel competent and independent. SIEGEL: But was it that much more thrilling to climb to the top of the jungle gym when there was a concrete ground beneath your feet than when there's a rubberized ground today? ROSIN: I think a lot of the thrill came from doing what you wanted and not necessarily being supervised and watched. So, for example, even when I was a kid, there weren't such separations. You know, there came to this idea that one side of the playground was 2 through 5, the other side of the playground is 6 through 12. That's kind of an arbitrary thing that playground manufacturers came up with. But it used to be that you could look around and see what the older kids were doing, and you would roam around in packs. And you would go to the ball field by yourself. I mean, we all - people of my age - and I'm in my 40s - remember what childhood was like. It was so different than how my own children are growing up. SIEGEL: In your article, you described a researcher who filmed children playing back in the early 1970s in a New England town. And he goes back and talks to some of those same kids grown up and watches their children. And it's a completely different definition of parenting. ROSIN: This is one of the most interesting research projects I've come across because when he was in that town in 1972, he wasn't looking for anything particularly novel. He was just watching how kids play. They would go across the river, and they would build these houses. They would spend hours by themselves - three and four-year-olds, hours by themselves in the forest, just kind of roaming around, playing among the ferns. And then he returned in 2004 and what he found was that the parents - they were now parents - had whole different ideas about what was plausible, what was safe, whether their children could wander or not. And essentially, the children had no what's called free range. They weren't allowed to wander very much by themselves. SIEGEL: The first tip-off was that the researcher, when he asked to talk to the children, the parents were very, very wary of him being alone with their children. ROSIN: Yeah. And it wasn't so much that they thought that there was something creepy or weird about him. It's just that they were in the habit of always watching their children. So as he talked to the child, the mother followed him around the backyard. And also, it wasn't such a novelty for the child to talk to him the way it was in the '70s because they talk to grownups all the time. That's all they ever do, and so it wasn't that interesting to them. SIEGEL: Now, at a very distant extreme from the completely supervised playground that many of us may see little children in today, you describe a playground in North Wales in Great Britain which is designed to be a kind of semi-supervised wild area, risky play area for kids. ROSIN: Yeah. They're called junk playgrounds, or sometimes adventure playgrounds. They were relatively common in the 1940s in wartime U. K. , and there they were kind of in tune with the parenting norms, which is that children should be risky. They should grow up to be courageous and brave. They've had a little bit of a revival lately, and I went to visit one and it's remarkable by American standards. Children are playing with old tires, they're playing with hammers, they're building fires all over the playground by themselves. SIEGEL: Yeah. Let's deal with building fires. ROSIN: Yes. SIEGEL: Because, you know, there's a slightly Monty Python-esque edge to this story, which is that someone has analyzed the cost and benefit of children doing various activities. So the risk of fires is you could get burned. On the positive side, you can sit around like you're at a campfire and have good friendship. And they've decided fires are OK on balance. ROSIN: Yeah. I mean, there is something comically earnest about these books that they produce to show the cost and benefit of certain things. But I think what's radical about them is that there is a cost and benefit, that most parents would say children should get burned and that would be the end of the conversation. You say risk, we hear danger. Risk and danger are not the same thing, in fact. SIEGEL: Hanna, I think your article in The Atlantic is going to prove to be a test of all adult readers who will imagine what their childhood was like and how unsupervised their childhood was or supervised. And I'm beginning to think that people will exaggerate the degree of their freedom as children, that we tend to romanticize how many trees we climbed that we weren't supposed to climb, how many fences we jumped over that we weren't supposed to jump over. ROSIN: I wrote that in the article, that I have always feared that I might be exaggerating my freedom because what I did was so unimaginable in terms of today's childhood. On the other hand, that's why I love this guy Roger Hart's research because he has it on film. They were doing things by themselves, and their parents were nowhere to be found. SIEGEL: So what kind of a generation, do you think, is going to, you know, grow up out of this one? What kind of adults will they be like if they've been watched all their childhood? ROSIN: Well, one sad thought I had while doing this is that we often say that children grow up too fast, but maybe they never get a chance to grow up at all - to take the necessary interim steps in order to feel independent, in order to manage risk, in order to manage sadness. And I will say there's some niceness. I love the close relationship I have with my children. This is going to be a fine line we will all try to walk, to have a close relationship without having a suffocating or stifling relationship with them. SIEGEL: Hanna Rosin, thank you very much for talking with us. ROSIN: Thank you. SIEGEL: Hanna Rosin's article in the April issue of The Atlantic is titled \"Hey Parents: Leave Those Kids Alone. \" What do you think? Are today's kids overprotected? You can take our poll at npr. org. CORNISH: You're listening to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:  From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Audie Cornish. ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:  And I'm Robert Siegel. CORNISH: On the cover of the April issue of The Atlantic, there's a picture of a boy - he could be six or seven. He's looking to the right toward an adult, whose hand he's holding. He's also wearing a helmet and kneepads. And for further protection, he has a pillow strapped to his torso. The cover art is for Hanna Rosin's article, \"Hey Parents: Leave Those Kids Alone. \" It's about the overprotected child. Hanna Rosin, welcome to the program. HANNA ROSIN: Thank you. SIEGEL: First, I want you to talk about two contradictory facts about parenting statistics about the American parent today. ROSIN: One thing I'm always puzzled over is how it is that we parents, and mothers particularly, spend so much more time at work now than we did in the '70s, than my mother did, for example, and yet we spend a lot more time with our children. I've read that statistic over and over again and just assumed it was a mistake, you know, an oft-repeated mistake. How can that be that my mother, who was home a lot of the time, spent less time with me than I do with my kids? SIEGEL: And the answer is today parents spend a tremendous amount of time with their kids. ROSIN: Yes. I finally thought about it for one second as I was writing the story, and I realized my mother didn't spend time with me. She was home, but she didn't particularly want to see me on a Saturday and I didn't want to see her. And if I contrast that with my life, I'm always with my children all weekend. So the weekends alone probably could make up for the difference. SIEGEL: So what you're writing about is this phenomenon from the children's perspective, which is children are constantly supervised nowadays. ROSIN: Yes. Watched. Watched. They live with the assumption that they will always be watched. They look towards an adult if they need to make any decision, if they need to know whether they should go anywhere. At the playground, they assume they're going to be watched. And so I've never really thought about how that assumption of being watched changes your personality and your experience of childhood. SIEGEL: Not just watched in the playground. The playground has a rubberized ground underneath any climbing apparatus to make sure the child doesn't get injured. Enormous steps have been taken for the safety of this child. ROSIN: Which initially were taken for good reasons. In the '70s, there were certain cases. People were worried about certain dangers in the playground, and that was fine. But what's happened now is we swung way too far in the other direction such that we've become pre-occupied with safety, and that's really having an effect on the culture of childhood so that we're stripping children of their independence, of their ability to take risks, which are key to a happy childhood. SIEGEL: Yeah. This is the core of your article, which is that there is something that is unhelpful to a child to have one's safety be such a concern and so taken care of in so many ways. ROSIN: Yeah. I think we have this assumption now that children can't manage their own risks, that a child does not have the capacity to manage either a physical or an emotional risk unless we step in and manage it for them. But there's something a little bit unnatural about that. I think the process of growing up is the process of learning to manage those fears. When children used to play in playgrounds, they used to do things that felt risky to them. And I said felt risky. That doesn't mean they were dangerous, but they felt dangerous, and then a child's sense of conquering that fear is what allows them to feel competent and independent. SIEGEL: But was it that much more thrilling to climb to the top of the jungle gym when there was a concrete ground beneath your feet than when there's a rubberized ground today? ROSIN: I think a lot of the thrill came from doing what you wanted and not necessarily being supervised and watched. So, for example, even when I was a kid, there weren't such separations. You know, there came to this idea that one side of the playground was 2 through 5, the other side of the playground is 6 through 12. That's kind of an arbitrary thing that playground manufacturers came up with. But it used to be that you could look around and see what the older kids were doing, and you would roam around in packs. And you would go to the ball field by yourself. I mean, we all - people of my age - and I'm in my 40s - remember what childhood was like. It was so different than how my own children are growing up. SIEGEL: In your article, you described a researcher who filmed children playing back in the early 1970s in a New England town. And he goes back and talks to some of those same kids grown up and watches their children. And it's a completely different definition of parenting. ROSIN: This is one of the most interesting research projects I've come across because when he was in that town in 1972, he wasn't looking for anything particularly novel. He was just watching how kids play. They would go across the river, and they would build these houses. They would spend hours by themselves - three and four-year-olds, hours by themselves in the forest, just kind of roaming around, playing among the ferns. And then he returned in 2004 and what he found was that the parents - they were now parents - had whole different ideas about what was plausible, what was safe, whether their children could wander or not. And essentially, the children had no what's called free range. They weren't allowed to wander very much by themselves.

Ripples in the fabric of space and time were predicted almost a century ago by Albert Einstein. Many of Einstein's theories have held up, but genius though he may have been, he wasn't right all the time. NPR's Geoff Brumfiel has the story of some newly uncovered work by the great physicist where he got it wrong. Really wrong. GEOFF BRUMFIEL, BYLINE: Albert Einstein changed physics forever. His Theory of Relativity is a set of rules that explains how the whole universe works. But not every idea he had was so great. Cormac O'Raifeartaigh is a physicist at the Waterford Institute of Technology in Ireland. Last year he was going through some old Einstein manuscripts. They're part of a huge digital archive kept by the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. CORMAC O'RAIFEARTAIGH: And so that's when the fun started. We were looking through these drafts one-by-one and one afternoon in late August the more I looked at a particular draft, the more I got this queer feeling that this is not what everybody thinks it is. BRUMFIEL: What everyone thought it was was the draft of a paper published in 1931. And it started out the same way but as O'Raifeartaigh read on he realized this was something else. O'RAIFEARTAIGH: So it's a bit like finding a play; you're looking through a draft version of Beckett's play \"Waiting for Godot\" and then you suddenly realize halfway through, oh, wait a minute, there's no Godot in this play at all. BRUMFIEL: What O'Raifeartaigh found was a draft of a theory that Einstein hadn't published and nobody knew about. It was trying to solve a big problem of the day. An astronomer named Edwin Hubble - the guy they named the Hubble telescope after - he'd just observed that everything in the Universe is moving outward. O'RAIFEARTAIGH: Spiral Nebulae, which are the most distant objects in the sky were rushing away from each other, not just from us, but from each other. BRUMFIEL: Now we know that the Universe started in a Big Bang and its still growing. But when Einstein was working on this idea. . . O'RAIFEARTAIGH: This is pre-big-bang, that's the fascinating thing about it. BRUMFIEL: Einstein, like pretty much everyone else back then, still thought the universe was static. That it never changed. So he asked himself, Albert, if the universe is expanding, why isn't it filling up with empty space? Einstein's solution is in this undiscovered paper. He proposed that as the universe expanded, new matter appeared to fill in the gaps. New stars and galaxies just popped up. So even as it grows, the universe looks the same. O'RAIFEARTAIGH: The universe is expanding, but it's not necessarily changing. BRUMFIEL: Just to be clear, this theory is totally wrong. Wrong wrong wrong. But for a little while Einstein thought it was right. The calculations appeared to work. Except that he had made a mathematical mistake. He wrote a minus sign where he should have written a plus. And this isn't the only mistake of Einstein's that O'Raifeartaigh has caught. He's also seen a paper were Einstein messed up a simple unit conversion, sort of like changing miles into kilometers. O'RAIFEARTAIGH: It was easy for me to spot it because I'm forever making the same mistake myself. BRUMFIEL: Actually, it turns out that Einstein screwed up calculations all the time. Mario Livio is an astrophysicist at the Space Telescope Science Institute. MARIO LIVIO: About 20 percent of Einstein's papers contain actually various mistakes of various degrees. BRUMFIEL: And Einstein's not alone. Livio's written a book called \"Brilliant Blunders\" all about some big mistakes made by great scientists. LIVIO: You try to think in unconventional ways and when you do that, guess what? Sometimes actually you encounter a mistake. BRUMFIEL: Darwin got evolution right, but his ideas on how individual traits were inherited turned out to be way off. And then there's Nobel-Prize-winning chemist Linus Pauling. LIVIO: His model for DNA had almost everything that you can think of wrong with it. It had three strands instead of two, it was built inside out, and it basically violated some basic rules of chemistry. BRUMFIEL: Einstein eventually found his mathematical error. He crossed it out, and realized his idea wouldn't work. Cormac O'Raifeartaigh says it looks like Einstein set it aside. Maybe he forgot about it. O'RAIFEARTAIGH: He doesn't burn the manuscript, and he doesn't use it as a shopping list, which he often did, he keeps it. But it's true that he never ever refers to the model again. BRUMFIEL: And today it lives on as a reminder that to be great, you don't always have to be right. But it does help if you're right most of the time. Geoff Brumfiel, NPR News.

Now they've figured out what they belong to - a kind of a birdlike animal which they're calling the Chicken from Hell. NPR's Christopher Joyce explains why. CHRISTOPHER JOYCE, BYLINE: Take a chicken, cross it with an ostrich, bulk it up to 500 pounds, and stretch it out to about 11 feet. Put a bony crest on its head like some ancient Greek helmet, add a dinosaur tail, a pair of arms with five-inch claws on the end. Finally, stick some feathers on it. Chicken from Hell? Paleontologist Matt Lamanna thinks the name fits. MATT LAMANNA: If you were to take a time machine back to the end of the age of dinosaurs. . . JOYCE: Fossil-hunters love the idea of time machines. LAMANNA: . . . and encountered this animal, your first thought would probably be, what a big, weird-looking bird. I actually think Chicken from Hell is a pretty good nickname for this thing. JOYCE: There's also this: The three new specimens Lamanna has now put together were dug up from the Hell Creek geological formation in Montana and the Dakotas. So either way, the name works. And it's a lot snappier than the official name Lamanna gave it: Anzu wyliei. Lamanna is the top dino scientist at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History in Pittsburgh. He says professional fossil hunters found the bones over a decade ago. One of them was Tyler Lyson, who grew up in North Dakota and now works at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History. TYLER LYSON: Starting as a young kid, I would go out with paleontologists who'd come to the area and they would hire me. JOYCE: They pay you well? LYSON: No. (LAUGHTER)LYSON: Fifty dollars a day. And they worked me. JOYCE: But in the sixth grade, that's not bad. LYSON: It was great. Yeah, before that I had a lawn mowing business. JOYCE: He quit mowing lawns - fossils were more fun. Lyson's mother would pack a lunch and take a lawn chair out and watch while her son looked for bones in the badlands. And one day when he was in high school, Lyson found a big one and then more of them. Other fossil hunters turned up yet more in the same vicinity. Most of these bones sat around in museums until Lamanna got interested. He helped organize a group of scientists who spent years studying them. They knew about similar bird-like dinosaurs in Asia called oviraptors. These three new specimens were relatives but bigger, stronger, and some different bone shapes too. At the Smithsonian, there are now several drawers full of casts made from the Hell Chicken in an antique cabinet in the office of Hans Seus. HANS SEUS: We have vertebrae. We have some - some of the individual skull bones. So here, for instance, a nice brain case. JOYCE: Sues is a curator of vertebrate paleontology at the museum. He hoists the skull - it's the size of a watermelon with this ridge-like bony crest on top. The lower jaw is a foot long. Like a bird, the dinosaur had no teeth. What it did have is a special hinge where the upper and lower jaws fit together. SEUS: So the jaw could sort of slide back and forth to cut food between the two halves of the beak. JOYCE: Seus says that's the way rats chew. Who knew? Hell Chicken probably ate vegetation, small animals maybe, and eggs. Certainly it was fast with a thigh-bone like a baseball bat and bony ridges where big muscles could attach. SEUS: This would have been a really big, massive drumstick. (LAUGHTER)JOYCE: And the shin bone is actually longer than the thigh bone. SEUS: And that's always a dead give-away for an animal that can run really fast. JOYCE: Seus says the discovery, described in the journal PLOS ONE, shows how widely and wildly life forms evolved. SEUS: We had little bits and pieces of it. Now we have for the first time a complete picture what this creature looks like. Certainly a remarkably odd looking creature. JOYCE: Something the other Dr. Seuss might well have invented. For Carnegie's Matt Lamanna, the discovery shows that there are still new fossil surprises to be dug up. LAMANNA: What else is waiting for us out there in some of the far reaches of the world? And that's what's one of the most exciting things to me about being a dinosaur paleontologist. JOYCE: Christopher Joyce, NPR News.

What it did have is a special hinge where the upper and lower jaws fit together. SEUS: So the jaw could sort of slide back and forth to cut food between the two halves of the beak. JOYCE: Seus says that's the way rats chew. Who knew? Hell Chicken probably ate vegetation, small animals maybe, and eggs. Certainly it was fast with a thigh-bone like a baseball bat and bony ridges where big muscles could attach. SEUS: This would have been a really big, massive drumstick. (LAUGHTER) JOYCE: And the shin bone is actually longer than the thigh bone. SEUS: And that's always a dead give-away for an animal that can run really fast. JOYCE: Seus says the discovery, described in the journal PLOS ONE, shows how widely and wildly life forms evolved. SEUS: We had little bits and pieces of it. Now we have for the first time a complete picture what this creature looks like. Certainly a remarkably odd looking creature. JOYCE: Something the other Dr. Seuss might well have invented. For Carnegie's Matt Lamanna, the discovery shows that there are still new fossil surprises to be dug up. LAMANNA: What else is waiting for us out there in some of the far reaches of the world? And that's what's one of the most exciting things to me about being a dinosaur paleontologist. JOYCE: Christopher Joyce, NPR News.", "section": "Science", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2014 NPR.

The environmental damage at the time was horrendous, but many scientists thought it would be short lived. Instead, it stretched out for many years. NPR's Elizabeth Shogren reports that 25 years of research has now led to some startling conclusions about oil's persistent effects. ELIZABETH SHOGREN, BYLINE: Cordova, Alaska, was the closest fishing village to the spill. Since then, it's become a hub for scientists. Researchers recently gathered in the town's library to talk about herring. It was the herring that tipped off scientists that oil's effects were more complicated than they imagined. Here's what happened: Herring were spawning at the time of the spill. None of those herring eggs survived. But a year later, the herring population seemed to bounce back. JEEP RICE: That was the nature of oil spills. You studied them for one or two years. When things were back on track, you walked away. SHOGREN: Jeep Rice from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration says herring seemed to match that conventional wisdom. RICE: And so we walked away from herring. And all of a sudden, they crash to the bottom of the floor, and then we're scrambling trying to figure out why. SHOGREN: In addition to the herring population crashing, other animals also unexpectedly suffered for years: killer whales, sea otters, harlequin ducks. It seemed it didn't take much oil to do a lot of damage, and do it in different ways. For example, oil under rocks and in sediments contaminated clams that sea otters ate. It didn't kill the otters outright. Dan Esler is with the U. S. Geological Survey. He says it shortened their lives and suppressed the population for 20 years. DAN ESLER: The understanding that lingering oil could have chronic effects on wildlife populations was a new and important finding, and one that we did not anticipate at the time that we started the research. SHOGREN: Then there was another unexpected effect, on fish eggs. The clue came from pink salmon, which weren't doing well even years after the spill. To figure that out, NOAA's Jeep Rice's team exposed pink salmon embryos to tiny amounts of oil. RICE: We were dosing them with oil that you couldn't see, you couldn't smell. But we're doing it for a long time. And six months later, you know, they had abnormalities. And, you know, kind of wow. SHOGREN: The substances responsible were polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons that are found in oil. Scientists hadn't realized they're toxic to aquatic life. They discovered these compounds persist long after other parts of oil evaporate. It took years to figure all this out. But still, no one knew how the oil was damaging the animals over the long term. One possibility was fish hearts. It's one of the first things that develops in a fish embryo. Another NOAA scientist, John Incardona, tried a novel experiment with fish. JOHN INCARDONA: We put them on a treadmill in essence for fish, a swim tunnel, and tested how fast they could swim for a prolonged period, and the oil exposed ones couldn't swim as fast for long. We found that the shape of their hearts were different. SHOGREN: OK. So now, they had a good idea what organ was harmed. But they still didn't know what the mechanism was. Then came the spring of 2010 and the big BP oil spill into the Gulf of Mexico. Scientists focused on fish likely to be spawning, such as the blue fin tuna. Barbara Block is a marine biologist at Stanford University who studies tuna. She feared the BP spill like the Exxon Valdez could have long-term effects. BARBARA BLOCK: Survivorship of the eggs are critical for future generations, especially on a severely depleted population of the bluefin that breed in the Gulf of Mexico. SHOGREN: Block collaborated with the NOAA scientists to answer a question that still puzzled them. BLOCK: What would cause a fish heart to slow down? SHOGREN: They showed that oil interrupts the electrical signals that are essential for fish hearts to beat effectively. So far, they think this can happen to embryos or young fish. BLOCK: What we're doing is applying the science of the Exxon Valdez and taking it into 21st century methodologies. SHOGREN: It's like a coroner pinning down a mysterious cause of death but taking 25 years to do it. And as in a criminal case, this knowledge could give scientists evidence to hold companies responsible for long-term damages no one ever knew oil spills were causing. Elizabeth Shogren, NPR News.

The accident happened just two days before the anniversary of America's most famous oil spill. It was 25 years today that the Exxon Valdez ran aground in Prince William Sound in Alaska. This week, NPR is exploring the legacy of that environmental and economic disaster. And today, NPR's Debbie Elliott takes us to a remote fishing town thrown into disarray by the spill. MICHELLE HAHN O'LEARY: Oh, here is a real good gust. DEBBIE ELLIOTT, BYLINE: It's a blustery, snowy March day when Michelle Hahn O'Leary offers a tour of Cordova, Alaska, starting at the fishing harbor. O'LEARY: We're on Orca Inlet, which is the bay right in front of Cordova. And we're driving in front of a lot of the canneries. ELLIOTT: Commercial fishing is the lifeblood of this town of 2,200, situated on the eastern shore of Prince William Sound. Back in 1989, O'Leary and her late husband were preparing for the spring herring season when everything changed in the early morning hours of March 24th. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)CAPT. JOE HAZELWOOD: It's the Valdez. . . ELLIOTT: Capt. Joe Hazelwood's call to the Coast Guard just after midnight. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)HAZELWOOD: Evidently, leaking some oil. . . . ELLIOTT: Leaking some oil. The ruptured tanker oozed 11 million gallons of crude into Prince William Sound. O'LEARY: It just felt like I'd been kicked in the stomach. This was one of those turning points in life where you measure things before and after. ELLIOTT: O'Leary has never fished since. Native Alaskan Tom Andersen no longer makes his living from the sea either. TOM ANDERSEN: You can't fix it. Once you break that egg, sometimes that's it. ELLIOTT: Andersen says the waters here have sustained his people, the Chugach, for generations. The 71-year-old commercial fisherman now picks up odd construction jobs, hanging dry wall. A whole way of living has been changed, he says, making a wiping motion with his arm. ANDERSEN: You pretty much live there. You got your clams and crabs and fish, and it you're at home. You know? Then somebody comes and dumps oil all over it. That's really hitting home. ELLIOTT: Because the oil company and government agencies were ill-prepared to respond, oil from the Exxon Valdez stretched for 11,000 square miles, fouling beaches, destroying fisheries, and killing hundreds of thousands of birds and all kinds of sea life, including whales and sea otters. Exxon eventually set up a voluntary program to compensate oil spill victims and hired local fishermen for the cleanup. Andersen worked a sea otter rescue crew. ANDERSEN: It didn't take us long either. You could smell it before ever saw it. ELLIOTT: He says Prince William Sound was silenced. ANDERSEN: There was no fish, no birds chasing fish. You could sit there and it would just be dead quiet. So everybody called it the Dead Zone. ELLIOTT: The disaster up-ended life in Cordova for years. Fishermen were docked. Businesses went bankrupt. Drug and alcohol abuse went up along with reports of domestic violence and depression. The mayor committed suicide. Those paid by Exxon to work the cleanup were jealously labeled spillionaires. Patience Andersen Faulkner, Tom Andersen's sister, says this once close-knit community changed. PATIENCE ANDERSEN FAULKNER: You couldn't look at your neighbor to help you. You didn't trust your neighbor. You didn't trust your brother. It was very, very sad. ELLIOTT: Faulkner is now part of a citizens' advisory council put in place to monitor the recovery and readiness for another oil spill. The panel is still tracking lingering oil from the Exxon-Valdez. CAPT. DAVE JANKA: Welcome aboard. (SOUNDBITE OF A DOOR)JANKA: Watch your step. ELLIOTT: Dave Janka captains the Auklet, a 58-foot wooden boat he uses for private charters. Most clients are scientists studying the oil spill's impact. Along the way he's collected his own samples. (SOUNDBITE OF AN OPENING JAR)ELLIOTT: He opens a jar labeled February 19th of this year. JANKA: Looks like oil, smells like oil. It's oil. ELLIOTT: Oh, yeah. (LAUGHTER)ELLIOTT: That's like what you smell on your hand after you pump gas. JANKA: Yeah. ELLIOTT: He collected the dark black oily-water mixture from Eleanor Island in Prince William Sound, digging down about six inches beneath the rocky shoreline. JANKA: If you or I in our backyard, at our mom and pop gas station, had a fuel tank leak, we would be held to the point of bankruptcy to clean that up. ELLIOTT: Exxon, now ExxonMobil Corporation, spent a total of $4. 3 billion in cleanup costs, legal damages, settlements and fines. Exxon Mobil spokesman Richard Keil says the company regrets the incident took place. RICHARD KEIL: Without doubt it was a tragic event. But it's something that we have learned from and we live those lessons each and every day. ELLIOTT: A class-action lawsuit wasn't resolved until 2008, when the U. S. Supreme Court slashed a $5 billion jury award to just over $500 million, plus nearly that much in interest. Fisherman and former Cordova Mayor Jim Kallander does not blame Exxon for mounting a defense. MAYOR JIM KALLANDER: We all need oil. Accidents are going to happen. ELLIOTT: But he says after 19 years of drawn-out litigation, the final Supreme Court verdict was the hardest blow. KALLANDER: Justice was not served. All my life I'd been brought up to think that, you know, when you get to the Supreme Court everything is made right. People are made whole. Issues are corrected. And I'm still disappointed. I'll never get over it. ELLIOTT: Kallander says now, 25 years later, the town of Cordova has nearly come full circle, even if the environmental recovery is incomplete. A killer whale pod in Prince William Sound is near extinction and the local herring fishery isn't back. But the harbor is bustling again with a fishing fleet getting ready to harvest salmon, halibut and cod. Kallander's boat, the Miss Emily, is now part of a stand-by fleet ready to respond to oil spills. KALLANDER: We have to be fueled up and watered up and have groceries on board, be ready to go 24/7. ELLIOTT: Back out at Orca Inlet, Michelle O'Leary warns even with the new readiness, the lesson from Exxon Valdez is that there's no way to put the oil back once it spills. O'LEARY: Right now we've got one of safest ports in the world. And we've got one of the best oil spill response plans. But the weather we're having today, nothing could be done - absolutely nothing. ELLIOTT: She's talking about the winds that are gusting to 60 miles an hour, winds that cancelled a planned oil spill response drill. Dispersants wouldn't work in these conditions, O'Leary says. And the oil would be nearly impossible to contain. Here in Alaska, the best laid plans are still at the mercy of Mother Nature. Debbie Elliott, NPR News.

And Florida has more native species of orchids than any other state. But even there, after more than a century of logging and development, wild orchids are hard to find. NPR's Greg Allen reports that a botanic garden near Miami has an ambitious plan: Planting a million orchids throughout South Florida. GREG ALLEN, BYLINE: Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden is internationally known for its research and conservation, also for its extensive tropical plants collection. Carl Lewis is a biologist and Fairchild's director. He points 30 feet up to the trunk of a palm tree, where a native orchid has taken root. CARL LEWIS: This is called the cowhorn orchid, Cyrtopodium punctatum. ALLEN: Oh, yeah. LEWIS: You can see some fruits hanging there from last year, and the flowers are just starting to open up. ALLEN: A cluster of yellow and red blossoms reaches out from the orchid's spiky leaves. There are varieties of orchids that grow on the ground. But in sub-tropical South Florida, most grow on the trunks or tree limbs. In the late 1800's, when the railroad came here, they were one of the first resources exploited. Millions of orchids were harvested and sent north as potted plants. Today, few are left in the wild. Lewis expects to change that soon. Under his direction, Fairchild has begun something it calls the Million Orchid Project. LEWIS: The basic concept is to get these orchids out into the community. We're not looking at putting them in natural areas per se, but we're trying to get them into some of the most population-dense urban areas here in South Florida. ALLEN: Lewis got the idea from Singapore's Botanic Gardens, which did something similar - establishing orchids in the heart of the city. LEWIS: And it's amazing to walk down a busy city street. And you wouldn't notice anything unless you look up into the canopy of the trees, and you'll see native, flowering orchids. ALLEN: Fairchild is starting with three orchid species that it's cultivating from seeds started here - in the Botanic Garden's micro-propagation lab. STEPHANIE THORMAN: Hello. LEWIS: Volunteers in here. Stephanie Thorman. ALLEN: The volunteers include scientists and others with lab experience who work in sterile conditions to grow the orchids from seeds no bigger than a speck. There are several racks full of bottle, each containing dozens of tiny orchids. LEWIS: These have actually already been transplanted once. We do have some bottles that are just at the earliest stage. This is what they look like a month after the seeds have been planted. ALLEN: They're just green blotches. Transferring them from one container to another as they grow is a bit like building a ship in a bottle. Seated at a lab bench, volunteer Mike Reeve uses forceps to move each little shoot, one by one. MIKE REEVE: They've grown well enough they've used the nutrients in this medium. So we've made up new bottles of fresh medium with the nutrients, and we're transferring them into a fresh medium. ALLEN: As they grow, the orchids are moved to a greenhouse. When they're large enough - beginning this spring - volunteers, arborists, and others will begin putting them into trees throughout Miami. Fairchild director Lewis says the Million Orchid Project is part of a new direction in conservation, working not just in natural areas but where people live. Some of the orchids, he says, won't survive. Others may be taken. But he's confident the project will re-establish some of Florida's most beautiful native plants back into the wild. Lewis says labs have already done this for other endangered species. LEWIS: A classic example is the Venus flytrap that was hunted almost to extinction from the bogs of North Carolina. But now, there are micro-propagation labs producing them by the millions. You can buy them in supermarkets. No one has the incentive to go back and steal them from the wild, so the populations are actually recovering. ALLEN: A million native plants established in local trees, Lewis hopes, will begin to do something similar for Florida's native orchids. Greg Allen, NPR news, Miami.

Under his direction, Fairchild has begun something it calls the Million Orchid Project. LEWIS: The basic concept is to get these orchids out into the community. We're not looking at putting them in natural areas per se, but we're trying to get them into some of the most population-dense urban areas here in South Florida. ALLEN: Lewis got the idea from Singapore's Botanic Gardens, which did something similar - establishing orchids in the heart of the city. LEWIS: And it's amazing to walk down a busy city street. And you wouldn't notice anything unless you look up into the canopy of the trees, and you'll see native, flowering orchids. ALLEN: Fairchild is starting with three orchid species that it's cultivating from seeds started here - in the Botanic Garden's micro-propagation lab. STEPHANIE THORMAN: Hello. LEWIS: Volunteers in here. Stephanie Thorman. ALLEN: The volunteers include scientists and others with lab experience who work in sterile conditions to grow the orchids from seeds no bigger than a speck. There are several racks full of bottle, each containing dozens of tiny orchids. LEWIS: These have actually already been transplanted once. We do have some bottles that are just at the earliest stage. This is what they look like a month after the seeds have been planted. ALLEN: They're just green blotches. Transferring them from one container to another as they grow is a bit like building a ship in a bottle. Seated at a lab bench, volunteer Mike Reeve uses forceps to move each little shoot, one by one. MIKE REEVE: They've grown well enough they've used the nutrients in this medium. So we've made up new bottles of fresh medium with the nutrients, and we're transferring them into a fresh medium. ALLEN: As they grow, the orchids are moved to a greenhouse. When they're large enough - beginning this spring - volunteers, arborists, and others will begin putting them into trees throughout Miami. Fairchild director Lewis says the Million Orchid Project is part of a new direction in conservation, working not just in natural areas but where people live. Some of the orchids, he says, won't survive. Others may be taken. But he's confident the project will re-establish some of Florida's most beautiful native plants back into the wild. Lewis says labs have already done this for other endangered species. LEWIS: A classic example is the Venus flytrap that was hunted almost to extinction from the bogs of North Carolina. But now, there are micro-propagation labs producing them by the millions. You can buy them in supermarkets. No one has the incentive to go back and steal them from the wild, so the populations are actually recovering. ALLEN: A million native plants established in local trees, Lewis hopes, will begin to do something similar for Florida's native orchids.

I'm Robert Siegel in Washington. MELISSA BLOCK, HOST: And I'm Melissa Block in Dallas. An international panel of scientists is predicting a long list of dire consequences of climate change over the next century - spreading disease, coastal floods, suffering crops. And they say it's too late to stop at least some warming. This is the consensus of hundreds of scientists. But one of them refused to put his name on the final summary. He felt it was too much doom and gloom, and he said it failed to account for human innovation. NPR's Geoff Brumfiel reports on the disagreement over the report's message. GEOFF BRUMFIEL, BYLINE: The latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is a grim accounting of our future on a warmer planet. Heat-related diseases are likely to rise. Crops will be harder to grow. Disputes over dwindling resources, like fresh water, might even lead to war. To climate economist Richard Tol, the report sounds pretty depressing. RICHARD TOL: It's risk, risk, risk, risk, risk, risk, risk. And climate change is dangerous and we're all going to die and we're all going to starve. BRUMFIEL: Tol is at the University of Sussex in the U. K. and helped to write the new report. He co-authored a chapter on the economic impact. But he took his name off the final summary of the report because he felt it didn't accurately account for human ingenuity. Take, for example, crop yields. The report says climate change will cause them to fall by a few percent per decade. But, Tol says, technological innovation will likely raise crop yields by 10 percent or more. TOL: So it's not that crop yields are going to fall, but they're going to rise more slowly because of climate change. And then, of course, it doesn't sound as alarming. BRUMFIEL: Now to be clear, Tol still believes in climate change and he still thinks it's a really serious problem. In fact, that's why he's speaking out. He thinks this report will work people up. Just when there needs to be a consensus on how to keep the world from getting even warmer, this report will move believers and deniers further apart. TOL: I think there is a real risk of this draft further polarizing the climate debate rather than calming things down and moving us forward. CHRIS FIELD: Richard's a great guy. I love him. But he's not in the center of the scientific community. BRUMFIEL: That's Chris Field, who co-chaired the entire report. He says Tol is just one of over 300 lead authors. FIELD: I don't ask them to all agree. What I ask them is to work together in a way that tells the world community what the position of the scientific community on this issue is. BRUMFIEL: Field thinks the report appropriately cautions about some very real risks. But he does acknowledge that predicting exactly what will happen is difficult because people aren't like melting glaciers. They don't just sit there, they adapt. FIELD: People have a tendency of changing what they do when they realize they have a problem. That's the core essence of adaptation. BRUMFIEL: A big part of this new report is encouraging people to respond. It's clear that the temperature will rise by at least four degrees Fahrenheit this century. Field thinks improved transportation infrastructure, better disaster response and healthcare could all help lessen the impact. But he also thinks too much faith in technology is itself risky. FIELD: One of the things that can create vulnerability is actually hubris, thinking that you're protected or that you're too rich or you're too smart to need protection. BRUMFIEL: In the end, these two researchers are arguing about wording, not facts. Both agree that climate change is happening, that humans aren't helpless, that we can adapt, and that unless we make changes to avoid even more warming, things will get a lot worse.

We've been reporting on this issue and today we're focusing on low income and minority students. They often struggle to find the money to pay for school and that can have an impact on the majors they choose. Too few make it into the sciences - fields that often require years of study and graduate degrees. A new program at the City University of New York is funneling minority students into astronomy and giving them the support they need, financial and otherwise, to succeed. From member station WNYC, Beth Fertig reports. BETH FERTIG, BYLINE: Ariel Diaz first felt the pull of astronomy when he was a Marine stationed in Camp Lejeune in North Carolina. At the time, he says he was miserable - missing his friends and family back in New York City. ARIEL DIAZ: And I would go to the beach with my friend Brandon Tilly and we would go and we would just go to the beach, have a beer and just look at the stars and, and everything was OK. FERTIG: Diaz finished his service three years ago and came home, enrolling in a community college at the City University of New York. When it was time to take a science class, he thought about that time on the beach. DIAZ: Like, I like stars, let me take an easy course. Let me take an easy astronomy course. (LAUGHTER)FERTIG: It wasn't easy. As any Astronomy 101 student can tell you, it's not star gazing but lots of physics and math. Diaz needed help passing calculus. But he says it was worth it to learn about stars and galaxies. DIAZ: I've never in my life, never in my life have I been motivated to do something. And this is the first thing that touched me. It was like I really like it and I want to do it. FERTIG: A professor was so impressed she encouraged Diaz to apply to a new program called AstroComNYC at the City University of New York. The tuition is fully funded. Diaz was already covered by the G. I. Bill but as a low-income student, he's grateful the program also includes a research job in astronomy this summer. DIAZ: And they're paying us for this opportunity. That's unheard of to me where I'm coming from. FERTIG: AstroCom is among many programs funded by the National Science Foundation to bring more underrepresented minorities into the sciences.  The country's most famous astronomer, Neil Degrasse Tyson, is African-American, but the data show only two percent of all U. S. students earning doctoral degrees in astronomy and physics, over an entire decade, were either black or Hispanic. TIM PAGLIONE: So if we just throw a couple more students into grad school, we make a huge impact. FERTIG: Tim Paglione is in charge of AstroCom. He's a professor at York College at Queens, which is part of CUNY, and a research associate at the American Museum of Natural History. He says CUNY's low-income, mostly minority students often aren't prepared well in high school for all that math and physics. And many of them have to work to pay for college. PAGLIONE: We don't want them to be working. We want them to be concentrating on their academics. So we removed that tuition problem. FERTIG: In addition, AstroCom provides free transportation on the city subways and buses, plus laptop computers and mentors. Students meet every Friday at the museum for a class on scientific research methods. PAGLIONE: So we have three different kinds. We have the alpha, beta and the gamma. . . FERTIG: Today, Ariel Diaz and three of his fellow students are sitting in a conference room with their laptops learning about radiation. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: That was gamma, right? UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: It was. . . FERTIG: But mentoring is expensive. AstroCom has only accepted eight students since it started two years ago. It expects to reach about 25 by the end of its five-year grant. Diaz's astronomy professor, Saavik Ford of the Borough of Manhattan Community College, says there's a reason it's so small. SAAVIK FORD: It's an apprenticeship program. Because that's what we know works. We can't have one faculty member to 50 students. It's not effective. FERTIG: Ford says that's borne out by decades of research. FORD: And we have this huge dropout rate and it's much worse for underrepresented minorities and women. FERTIG: Researchers say these groups often need extra support, financial and otherwise. They point to a similar program in Tennessee that boosted the number of blacks and Latinos earning Ph. D. 's. But this new one at CUNY starts earlier, beginning with freshman, to keep them on track. So far, all eight of the students in AstroCom are still in school, although two left for other majors. Betsy Hernandez started the program this year and her goal is a Ph. D. in physics. She's 35 and works part-time. She says the free tuition has lightened her load. BETSY HERNANDEZ: I would have continued with my student loans, which I didn't want. That's one of the reasons why I stopped at one point, going to school, because I wanted to get rid of the debt. FERTIG: For Ariel Diaz, it's all the other support that's really making the difference. He lives in a small apartment with his father in public housing, where it's hard to even find a quiet place to study. DIAZ: I just don't have the space. My door doesn't close and I receive knocks all the time. FERTIG: Diaz grew up here on the Lower East Side. He's grateful for the free laptop computer and the monthly transit card. They enable him to study at the museum when he isn't helping to care for his father - who is blind and has diabetes. Sixty-eight-year-old old Jovino Diaz says he's proud his son, even if he doesn't fully understand what he's studying. He had very little education himself in his native Dominican Republic. JOVINO DIAZ: (Spanish spoken)DIAZ: He's saying as long as I'm studying that's all he really cares about. Because as long as you're studying to go forward, you're not going to go backwardsFERTIG: By going forward, Ariel Diaz says he hopes to become a professor. Some day, he can teach other students and change the face of astronomy research. For NPR News, I'm Beth Fertig in New York.

I'm Robert Siegel. Saving for retirement is a challenge most Americans face and research shows that challenge is complicated by basic human impulses. We know we should be saving, but we don't. We consistently make bad financial decisions. NPR's Chris Arnold reports on how emotions get in the way. CHRIS ARNOLD, BYLINE: To understand one reason why we have such a hard time saving for retirement, I'm going to tell you a story. It's a story about my new car. Actually, it's a story about my old horrible car, but I just bought it three months ago. OK. So I'm getting into my new old Jeep here and I'm going to go see my mechanic or my body shop guy. OK. Here's what happened. I had this old Jeep Cherokee. It was the first new car I ever bought back 15 years ago. I loved that car. But then, this jerk rear-ended me when I was stopped at a traffic light and the car got completely totaled. Insurance only gave me $3,000, but still, impulsively, I ran out with that money and bought the first car that I could find that looked like my old one to replace it. The problem is what I got for that was a beat-up, cheap, old rusty used Jeep and now, I am, as you might imagine, having some regrets. So I can't believe this car is as rusted out as it is. And listen to that rattle. I mean, what is that? This car is like a loose, rusty, bag of bolts. I take the car over to Elite Bodyworks in Boston. The owner, a guy named Ken Lucas, unfortunately agrees with me. How bad is the rust under the back end? KEN LUCAS: It's extremely bad. It's probably not a very safe vehicle to drive. And I wouldn't recommend you drive it. ARNOLD: Now, I cover financial stuff as a reporter and I've always saved a lot for retirement. But when I lost this car that I loved, it's like my primitive brain just took over. And it turns out the reason I probably made such a rash and bad decision is a reason lots of Americans make all kinds of bad financial decisions constantly. BRIGITTE MADRIAN: You were trying to eliminate the loss. ARNOLD: Professor Brigitte Madrian teaches behavioral economics at Harvard. MADRIAN: You know, you experienced this loss of your car, and you wanted to make the loss go away. ARNOLD: And it turns out, this human instinct to avoid loss, Madrian calls it loss aversion, it's very powerful. In fact, once we have something, like my Jeep, we hate losing it even more than we enjoyed getting it in the first place. MADRIAN: It hurts twice as bad. The literature suggests that people are twice as sensitive to losses as they are to gains. ARNOLD: Which brings us back to retirement. We know we should save, but most people hate writing a check to squirrel money away for the future. That feels like a loss from our checking account. So. . . MADRIAN: The best advice by far is to take advantage of things like payroll deduction. ARNOLD: That is, having your employer put part of your pay into a retirement account before it ever shows up in your checking account. That sort of tricks you into feeling like you never had the money in the first place. And that saves us from ourselves. MADRIAN: The money you don't see is the money you don't miss. ARNOLD: But the financial services industry has figured this out, too. Mutual funds and advisors, they say, hey, forget it. Don't write us a check or anything. We'll just take a percentage out of the money we're holding and investing for you. That's often very expensive over time. But people agree to it. MADRIAN: The loss you don't see is the loss you don't feel. You know, if the return on your investment is 8 percent this year instead of 10 percent this year, you might feel perfectly happy because the investment still went up. ARNOLD: But Madrian says, over time, if you're paying 1 or 2 percent in fees that come out of your retirement account each year over, say, 30 years, that's going to. . . MADRIAN: Going to add up to a substantial reduction in what you could've saved over time. ARNOLD: You're losing hundreds of thousands of dollars. MADRIAN: Yeah, potentially. ARNOLD: As for me, my Jeep will no longer start and I'm trying to get the guy who sold it to me to buy it back. Chris Arnold, NPR News, Boston.

That sort of tricks you into feeling like you never had the money in the first place. And that saves us from ourselves. MADRIAN: The money you don't see is the money you don't miss. ARNOLD: But the financial services industry has figured this out, too. Mutual funds and advisors, they say, hey, forget it. Don't write us a check or anything. We'll just take a percentage out of the money we're holding and investing for you. That's often very expensive over time. But people agree to it. MADRIAN: The loss you don't see is the loss you don't feel. You know, if the return on your investment is 8 percent this year instead of 10 percent this year, you might feel perfectly happy because the investment still went up. ARNOLD: But Madrian says, over time, if you're paying 1 or 2 percent in fees that come out of your retirement account each year over, say, 30 years, that's going to. . . MADRIAN: Going to add up to a substantial reduction in what you could've saved over time. ARNOLD: You're losing hundreds of thousands of dollars. MADRIAN: Yeah, potentially. ARNOLD: As for me, my Jeep will no longer start and I'm trying to get the guy who sold it to me to buy it back.

KEITH CHEN: Yeah. We've done a lot of work together on capuchins and money. RAZ: This is Keith Chen. He's a friend of Laurie's from college. And. . . CHEN: I'm an associate professor of economics here at UCLA in the Anderson School. RAZ: But one of the things Keith noticed working with those monkeys. . . CHEN: . . . Is that it's very, very difficult to get them to save for the future. RAZ: And it's hard to get certain people to save for the future, too. But only certain people. CHEN: So, you know, the recent financial crisis really kind of hit home with this, like, really, really stark fact, which is there are countries around the world that just seem similar on so many dimensions, but which display radically different savings behavior. RAZ: And Keith is talking about rich countries - OECD countries with stable governments, stable economies, good education systems, but whose citizens do not save money in the same way. CHEN: So there can be, in any given year, an OECD country which is saving over 25 percent of its GDP, 40 percent of its GDP. RAZ: So, like, Japan or China or the Scandinavian countries. While there are other ones. . . CHEN: . . . You know, like the United States, for example, that barely cracks 10 percent. RAZ: So the issue for Keith and for a lot of economists who've been looking at this issue for decades is why. CHEN: Why do we see such radically different savings behavior across countries? RAZ: Keith was exploring just that question when he came up with kind of a crazy idea that directly connects the way you save money with the language you speak. We'll explain in a moment. I'm Guy Raz. And this is the TED Radio Hour from NPR. (MUSIC)RAZ: It's the TED Radio Hour from NPR. I'm Guy Raz. Our show today, the money paradox. Ideas around why money has so much influence on our behavior. So a moment ago, we met Keith Chen. He's an economist. CHEN: Yeah. So what I am, more specifically, is a behavioral economist, and most importantly, one of the primary things I study is how people make decisions about really, really far-off events. So how is it that I bring myself to save for retirement even if that's 35 years away? RAZ: OK, so for a long time, economists have grappled with a mystery - why are, say Americans or Greeks or the British, so bad at saving money compared with the Chinese or the Fins? CHEN: So why is it that the Chinese, the Scandinavians and the Japanese save so much? And what I started to notice as an economist was that all of these countries, which are outliers to an economist are also outliers to linguists when they think about languages that don't kind of strictly grammaticalize the difference between the future and the present. And so it started to click in my mind that, wow, you know, can this just be a coincidence or is there a deeper pattern here? RAZ: Here's how Keith explained it from the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)CHEN: So, for example, if I'm speaking in English, I have to speak grammatically differently if I'm talking about passed rain - it rained yesterday, current rain - it is raining now or future rain - it will rain tomorrow. Notice that English requires a lot more information with respect to the timing of events. Why? Because I have to consider that, and I have to modify what I'm saying to say it will rain or it's going to rain. It's simply not permissible in English to say it rained tomorrow. In contrast to that, that's almost exactly what you would say in Chinese. A Chinese speaker can basically say something that sounds very strange to an English speaker's ears. They can say yesterday it rained, now it rained, tomorrow it rained. In some deep sense, Chinese doesn't divide up the time spectrum in the same way that English forces us to constantly do in order to speak correctly. RAZ: And to linguists, this means that Chinese is a futureless language. English, on the other hand, is a futured language, which means that time constantly intrudes into our speech in all kinds of ways. CHEN: So, for example, if you asked me, you know, Keith, how long can we keep speaking. . . RAZ: How long? CHEN: . . . So, you know, we can keep going for hours. But, you know, I have some graduate students back - waiting for me back in my office. It's perfectly natural, if we were speaking Mandarin Chinese with each other, for me to say, you know, I'm sorry, we kind of have to wrap this up. I meet with student in an hour. Like, it's - that doesn't sound strange at all to a Chinese speaker's ear. RAZ: And that led Keith to an intriguing hypothesis - could how you speak about time affect the way you think about money? (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)CHEN: You speak English, a futured language, and what that means is that every time you discuss the future or any kind of a future event, grammatically, you're forced to cleave that from the present and treat it as if it's something viscerally different. Now suppose that that visceral difference makes you suddenly disassociate the future from the present every time you speak. If that's true, and it makes the future feel like something more distant and more different from the present, that's going to make it harder to save. If, on the other hand, you speak a futureless language, the present and the future, you speak about them identically. If that suddenly nudges you to feel about them identically, that's going to make it easier to save. RAZ: OK, so to test this theory out, Keith gathered up millions of data points - data from health and lifestyle surveys taken from around the world. And then he controlled for religion, sex and family size. CHEN: Imagine two families that have exactly the same number of children, the heads of households are exactly the same age, they've gotten exactly the same number of years of education, have the same type of college degree. They find themselves in the same income-decile. They live within miles of each other, but the languages that these two families speak at home, one of these languages equates the future and the present, and one of these languages separates the future and the present in their grammar. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)CHEN: Now even after all of this granular level of control, do futureless language speakers seem to save more? Yes. Futureless language speakers, even after this level of control, are 30 percent more likely to report having saved in any given year. Does this have cumulative effects? Yes. By the time they retire, futureless language speakers, holding constant their income, are going to retire with 25 percent more in savings. Can we push this data even further? Yes. Think about smoking, for example. Smoking is, in some deep sense, negative savings, right. If savings is current pain in exchange for future pleasure, smoking is just the opposite. It's current pleasure in exchange for future pain. What we should expect then is the opposite effect. And that's exactly what we find. Futureless-language speakers are 20 to 24 percent less likely to be smoking at any given in time compared to identical families. And they're going to be 13 to 70 percent less likely to be obese by the time they retire. And they're going to report being 21 percent more likely to have used a condom in their last sexual encounter. I could go on and on with the list of differences that you can find. It's almost impossible not to find a savings behavior for which this strong effect isn't present. RAZ: That is insane. I mean, that is crazy to me that the language somebody speaks can determine. . . CHEN: Yeah. But, I mean, when you think about it, it can make perfect sense. Like, it's a really hard problem to think about. You know, money issues are difficult. Like, you know, do I save in a Roth? Do I save in a standard 401(k)? Like, how do I - how much should I save? You know, should I save in stocks? Should I save in bonds? RAZ: It just sounds like way out there, like, way out into the future. CHEN: Exactly. It's far away. Its abstract. It's difficult for you to visualize exactly why you're saving now. RAZ: So, like, what could people who have, you know, futured language, like, how do you fix it? Like, how do you get them to save better if, like, baked into the language is this problem? CHEN: Yeah. So my ultimate goal with a lot of this research is to really uncover the subtle things which nudge us to thinking about problems in one way or the other. And there's actually some fascinating work by a psychologist at the University of Pennsylvania, who - he got a company to do some interesting things to people's 401(k)forms. So you go into to work one day, and they ask you how much of your salary would you like set aside for your retirement account? And what this psychologist did was in one condition, he put your picture from the kind of corporate Facebook in the upper, right-hand side of the form. That he did to half of the people. To the other half of the people, he put an aged version of your picture, a digitally aged version of your picture in the upper, right-hand side of the form. And what he found is that people who had to stare at their future selves saved a lot more than people who were staring at their current selves while making this decision. RAZ: Wow. That's amazing. CHEN: So I would certainly never recommend that we abandon English, for example, for Finnish or something like that. But I think that becoming more aware and understanding exactly why it is that we allow kind of subtle nudges of our language to kind of affect our decision-making, in the end, will result in tools that'll help us kind of be better stewards of our own futures. RAZ: Keith Chen. A lot of economists believe that his groundbreaking research could change the way we think about savings. Check out his full talk at TED. com.

And that tension is what led Paul Piff to embark on a very unusual experiment. He's a psychologist at Berkeley. PAUL PIFF: What I do is study what makes people cooperative and kind toward others versus selfish and greedy. RAZ: And in a lot of his studies, he asks are rich people meaner than the rest of us? PIFF: And I've always wanted to run a study on what makes people drive the way that they do. RAZ: Paul and his colleagues tested an idea that you might already know instinctively, that people who drive really expensive cars are often the biggest jerks on the road. PIFF: And we actually literally had coders hiding behind bushes coding the kind of cars that were coming down the roadway. So how expensive is this car? And they were coding whether the driver of that car proceeds to stop. RAZ: This is just some, like, dude from your lab at the crosswalk? PIFF: Some dude from our lab who's posing as a pedestrian waiting to cross at a crosswalk of a busy roadway. RAZ: Now this is in California where if you do not stop for a pedestrian at a crosswalk, you're breaking the law. PIFF: And what we found was that 50 percent of those most expensive vehicles broke the law, whereas none, zero, not a single one of those least expensive cars did so. RAZ: OK, so what does this prove anyway? Well, it turns out you can take almost anyone, put them in a lab, and in just a few minutes, you can make them feel and act like they are both rich and mean. Here's Paul Piff on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)PIFF: I want you to, for a moment, think about playing a game of Monopoly, except this game's been rigged, and you've got the upper hand. And as you think about that experience, I want you to ask yourself how might that experience of being a privileged player in a rigged game change the way that you think about yourself and regard that other player? So we ran a study on the UC Berkeley campus to look at exactly that question. We brought in more than a hundred pairs of strangers into the lab. (SOUNDBITE OF RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER #1: Is it my roll? PIFF: You're going to have to pardon the sound quality in some cases because these are hidden cameras. (SOUNDBITE OF RECORDING)SPEAKER #1: I'll buy it. PIFF: With the flip of a coin, we randomly assigned one of the two to be a rich player in a rigged game. (SOUNDBITE OF RECORDING)SPEAKER #1: I want to build. PIFF: They got two times as much money. And they got to roll both dice instead of one. So they got to move around the board a lot more. (LAUGHTER)PIFF: And just to stick it to the poor player, the rich player gets to move the Rolls-Royce around, which is that really desirable, luxurious piece. RAZ: Oh yeah. PIFF: Whereas the poor player has got to move that measly, little shoe. No one wants that piece. RAZ: Or the thimble. Who likes the thimble? PIFF: No one wants the thimble. RAZ: Nobody wants the thimble. No. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)PIFF: The rich player started to move around the board louder, literally smacking the board with their piece as he went around. (SOUNDBITE OF RECORDING)PIFF: You're more likely to see signs of dominance and displays of power and celebration among the rich players. (SOUNDBITE OF RECORDING)SPEAKER #1: Wait did you get - how many 500's do you have? UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER #2: Just one. SPEAKER #1: Are you serious? SPEAKER #2: Yeah. SPEAKER #1: I have three. PIFF: And here's what I think was really, really interesting - is that at the end of the 15 minutes, we asked the players to talk about their experience during the game. And when the rich players talked about why they'd inevitably won in this rigged game of monopoly, they talked about what they'd done to buy those different properties and earned their success in the game. RAZ: So they're, like, I won 'cause I'm awesome. PIFF: I won because I'm awesome, because I know how to play this game, because I've played this game before. RAZ: Nobody said I was lucky? PIFF: A few people said that they got lucky rolls of the dice. But very few people talked about the fact that it was that flip of a coin that got them into that initial position of privilege. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)PIFF: What we've been finding across dozens of studies and thousands of participants across this country is that as a person's levels of wealth increase, their feelings of compassion and empathy go down. And their feelings of entitlement, of deserving this and their ideology of self-interest increases. In one of the studies, we bring in rich and poor members of the community into the lab and give each of them the equivalent of $10. And we told the participants that they could keep these $10 for themselves or they could share a portion of it with a stranger who's totally anonymous. And we'd just monitor how much people give. Individuals who made $25,000, sometimes under $15,000 a year gave 44 percent more of their money to the stranger than did individuals making $150,000, $200,000 a year. RAZ: That's unbelievable. I mean, it just seems counterintuitive. PIFF: Yeah. So for the last 60 or 70 years, there's been a trend that people have documented. Lower-income households give proportionately more of their incomes to charity than higher-income households. So proportionately speaking, the less well-off you are, the more charitable you are. RAZ: OK, but how does that happen? I mean, how does money change you? Like, say you come into a lot of it when you're like, you know, 50, what would happen? PIFF: Well, it would, for one, mean that you can afford a different kind of home. Maybe it means you can afford a bigger home where the people in your family would all occupy separate bedrooms. You'll have a bigger yard, potentially, or more space between your house and other people's homes. When you go to work, you may be less likely to take that bus or that carpool. When you get to work, you may be more likely to have a position of someone who's, say an overseer of other people as opposed to someone who works with one another in teams. And with that sort of increased self-focus, that increased control, you become less attuned to other people in your environment, less cooperative, less ethical, a whole slew of other things. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)PIFF: We ran another study were looked at whether people would be inclined to take candy from a jar of candy that we explicitly identified as being reserved for children. (LAUGHTER)PIFF: Participating - I'm not kidding. I know it sounds like I'm making a joke. We explicitly told participants this jar of candy is for children participating in the developmental lab nearby. They're in studies. This is for them, and we just monitored how much candy participants took. Participants who felt rich took two times as much candy as participants who felt poor. Now I don't mean to suggest that it's only wealthy people who show these patterns of behavior. Not at all. In fact, I think that we all, in our day-to-day, minute-by-minute lives, struggle with these competing motivations of when or if to put our own interests above the interests of other people. And that's understandable because the American dream is an idea in which we all have an equal opportunity to succeed and prosper. And a piece of that means that sometimes you need to put your own interests above the interests and well-being of other people around you. RAZ: When you think about your own research on this, does, like - is a part of you sort of, like, I don't know, like, disappointed in human behavior? PIFF: I don't know. You know, disappointment's not necessarily the right word because I think a lot of the effects that we're documenting are understandable. And what's important to recognize is that there are a lot of other things that shape how compassionate and generous a person is - their gender, their ethnicity, the social groups they belong to, how they were raised. Money is one of those factors, but it's not the only one. RAZ: You know, I think what's interesting about your research is that when he says that we're all basically, like, malleable and rich people are malleable, too, right. I mean, they can change and pretty quickly. PIFF: Absolutely. Now we found in our own laboratory work, and this has been replicated elsewhere and extended elsewhere, that when we bring wealthy people in and through even small nudges, simple reminders, a reminder of the needs of others, their levels of empathy, compassion and charity go up. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)PIFF: In one study, we had people watch a brief video, just 46 seconds long, about childhood poverty. And after watching that, we looked at how willing people were to offer up their own time to a stranger presented to them in the lab who was in distress. After watching this video, an hour later, rich people became just as generous of their own time to help out this other person, stranger as someone who's poor suggesting that these differences are not innate or categorical, but are so malleable to slight changes in people's values and little nudges of compassion and bumps of empathy.

And they were coding whether the driver of that car proceeds to stop. RAZ: This is just some, like, dude from your lab at the crosswalk? PIFF: Some dude from our lab who's posing as a pedestrian waiting to cross at a crosswalk of a busy roadway. RAZ: Now this is in California where if you do not stop for a pedestrian at a crosswalk, you're breaking the law. PIFF: And what we found was that 50 percent of those most expensive vehicles broke the law, whereas none, zero, not a single one of those least expensive cars did so. RAZ: OK, so what does this prove anyway? Well, it turns out you can take almost anyone, put them in a lab, and in just a few minutes, you can make them feel and act like they are both rich and mean. Here's Paul Piff on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) PIFF: I want you to, for a moment, think about playing a game of Monopoly, except this game's been rigged, and you've got the upper hand. And as you think about that experience, I want you to ask yourself how might that experience of being a privileged player in a rigged game change the way that you think about yourself and regard that other player? So we ran a study on the UC Berkeley campus to look at exactly that question. We brought in more than a hundred pairs of strangers into the lab. (SOUNDBITE OF RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER #1: Is it my roll? PIFF: You're going to have to pardon the sound quality in some cases because these are hidden cameras. (SOUNDBITE OF RECORDING) SPEAKER #1: I'll buy it. PIFF: With the flip of a coin, we randomly assigned one of the two to be a rich player in a rigged game. (SOUNDBITE OF RECORDING) SPEAKER #1: I want to build. PIFF: They got two times as much money. And they got to roll both dice instead of one. So they got to move around the board a lot more. (LAUGHTER) PIFF: And just to stick it to the poor player, the rich player gets to move the Rolls-Royce around, which is that really desirable, luxurious piece. RAZ: Oh yeah. PIFF: Whereas the poor player has got to move that measly, little shoe. No one wants that piece. RAZ: Or the thimble. Who likes the thimble? PIFF: No one wants the thimble. RAZ: Nobody wants the thimble. No. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) PIFF: The rich player started to move around the board louder, literally smacking the board with their piece as he went around. (SOUNDBITE OF RECORDING) PIFF: You're more likely to see signs of dominance and displays of power and celebration among the rich players. (SOUNDBITE OF RECORDING) SPEAKER #1: Wait did you get - how many 500's do you have? UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER #2: Just one. SPEAKER #1: Are you serious? SPEAKER #2: Yeah. SPEAKER #1: I have three. PIFF: And here's what I think was really, really interesting - is that at the end of the 15 minutes, we asked the players to talk about their experience during the game. And when the rich players talked about why they'd inevitably won in this rigged game of monopoly, they talked about what they'd done to buy those different properties and earned their success in the game. RAZ: So they're, like, I won 'cause I'm awesome. PIFF: I won because I'm awesome, because I know how to play this game, because I've played this game before. RAZ: Nobody said I was lucky? PIFF: A few people said that they got lucky rolls of the dice. But very few people talked about the fact that it was that flip of a coin that got them into that initial position of privilege. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) PIFF: What we've been finding across dozens of studies and thousands of participants across this country is that as a person's levels of wealth increase, their feelings of compassion and empathy go down. And their feelings of entitlement, of deserving this and their ideology of self-interest increases. In one of the studies, we bring in rich and poor members of the community into the lab and give each of them the equivalent of $10. And we told the participants that they could keep these $10 for themselves or they could share a portion of it with a stranger who's totally anonymous. And we'd just monitor how much people give. Individuals who made $25,000, sometimes under $15,000 a year gave 44 percent more of their money to the stranger than did individuals making $150,000, $200,000 a year. RAZ: That's unbelievable. I mean, it just seems counterintuitive. PIFF: Yeah. So for the last 60 or 70 years, there's been a trend that people have documented. Lower-income households give proportionately more of their incomes to charity than higher-income households. So proportionately speaking, the less well-off you are, the more charitable you are. RAZ: OK, but how does that happen? I mean, how does money change you? Like, say you come into a lot of it when you're like, you know, 50, what would happen? PIFF: Well, it would, for one, mean that you can afford a different kind of home. Maybe it means you can afford a bigger home where the people in your family would all occupy separate bedrooms. You'll have a bigger yard, potentially, or more space between your house and other people's homes. When you go to work, you may be less likely to take that bus or that carpool. When you get to work, you may be more likely to have a position of someone who's, say an overseer of other people as opposed to someone who works with one another in teams. And with that sort of increased self-focus, that increased control, you become less attuned to other people in your environment, less cooperative, less ethical, a whole slew of other things. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) PIFF: We ran another study were looked at whether people would be inclined to take candy from a jar of candy that we explicitly identified as being reserved for children. (LAUGHTER) PIFF: Participating - I'm not kidding. I know it sounds like I'm making a joke. We explicitly told participants this jar of candy is for children participating in the developmental lab nearby. They're in studies. This is for them, and we just monitored how much candy participants took. Participants who felt rich took two times as much candy as participants who felt poor. Now I don't mean to suggest that it's only wealthy people who show these patterns of behavior. Not at all. In fact, I think that we all, in our day-to-day, minute-by-minute lives, struggle with these competing motivations of when or if to put our own interests above the interests of other people. And that's understandable because the American dream is an idea in which we all have an equal opportunity to succeed and prosper. And a piece of that means that sometimes you need to put your own interests above the interests and well-being of other people around you. RAZ: When you think about your own research on this, does, like - is a part of you sort of, like, I don't know, like, disappointed in human behavior? PIFF: I don't know. You know, disappointment's not necessarily the right word because I think a lot of the effects that we're documenting are understandable. And what's important to recognize is that there are a lot of other things that shape how compassionate and generous a person is - their gender, their ethnicity, the social groups they belong to, how they were raised. Money is one of those factors, but it's not the only one. RAZ: You know, I think what's interesting about your research is that when he says that we're all basically, like, malleable and rich people are malleable, too, right. I mean, they can change and pretty quickly. PIFF: Absolutely. Now we found in our own laboratory work, and this has been replicated elsewhere and extended elsewhere, that when we bring wealthy people in and through even small nudges, simple reminders, a reminder of the needs of others, their levels of empathy, compassion and charity go up. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) PIFF: In one study, we had people watch a brief video, just 46 seconds long, about childhood poverty. And after watching that, we looked at how willing people were to offer up their own time to a stranger presented to them in the lab who was in distress. After watching this video, an hour later, rich people became just as generous of their own time to help out this other person, stranger as someone who's poor suggesting that these differences are not innate or categorical, but are so malleable to slight changes in people's values and little nudges of compassion and bumps of empathy. Thank you. (APPLAUSE) RAZ: Paul Piff. He's a social psychologist at the University of California Berkeley. You can check out his entire talk at TED. com. More on the money paradox in a moment.

I'm Guy Raz. And today on the show, the money paradox. Ideas around the way money captures all the contradictions of human psychology, and why our brains might actually be built to deal with money very, very badly. So a couple of years ago, a group of psychologists wanted to know why money makes us behave in all sorts of weird ways. So they started with a question. . . LAURIE SANTOS: What's makes humans special? What makes us unique? RAZ: Could you introduce yourself, please? SANTOS: Yeah. So I'm Laurie Santos. I'm a professor of psychology at Yale University. And I run the Yale Comparative Cognition Laboratory. RAZ: OK. The question, again. SANTOS: What makes humans special? What makes us unique? And one of the ways we try to get at that question is to study how other animals think about the world. In particular, how monkeys think about the world. RAZ: Monkeys? SANTOS: Yep. RAZ: Because they're so similar to us? SANTOS: Yeah. We study monkeys for a couple reasons. I'm not inherently interested in how monkeys think. I'm really interested in using them as a window to figure out how humans think. RAZ: And Laurie's work is about looking through that little monkey-shaped window and asking why humans make such big mistakes with money, why we generate recessions and depressions and bankruptcy and Ponzi schemes and credit card debt. Yeah we're, like - we're kind of dumb. Like, we make dumb. SANTOS: Yeah. And that's kind of the puzzle, right? It's like, sometimes our errors are systematic and predictable even in the face of bad consequences. And that makes them really curious to a psychologist like me. Why is it that we keep doing dumb things in the face of bad consequences? RAZ: OK. To answer that question, let's head to the TED stage with Laurie Santos. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SANTOS: You know, we're the smartest thing out there. Why can't we figure this out? In some sense, where do our mistakes really come from? And having thought about this a little bit, I have seen a couple different possibilities. One possibility is, in some sense, it's not really our fault. Because we're a smart species, we can actually create all kinds of environments that are super, super accommodated, sometimes too complicated for us to even actually understand, even though we've actually created them. We create financial markets that are super complex. We create mortgage terms that we can't actually deal with. And of course, if we are put in environments where we can deal with it, it in some sense makes sense that we actually might mess certain things up. If this was the case, we'd have a really easy solution to the problem of human error. We'd actually just say, OK, let's figure out the kinds of technologies we can't deal with, the kinds of environments that are bad, get rid of those, design things better, and we should be the noble species that we expect ourselves to be. But there's another possibility that I find a little bit more worrying, which is maybe it's not our environments that are messed up. Maybe it's actually us that's designed badly. RAZ: So to test this theory out, whether the mistakes we make with money are somehow a flaw in our design, Laurie decided to introduce monkeys to money. SANTOS: It sounds like a strange. . . RAZ: Yeah. SANTOS: . . . Concept, right, putting monkeys and money together. . . RAZ: Yeah. SANTOS: . . . But it turns out, not so strange. RAZ: So how do you make a monkey use money? SANTOS: Well, we weren't sure how we could make monkeys use money when we started these studies. And so we said, well, maybe we could give the monkeys something that worked like money. You know, if we gave them little tokens that worked like coins, would they treat it like money? Would they trade these tokens for food? RAZ: So you're a monkey, right. And you've got this little metal token, and an experimenter walks up to your cage with a grape. And if you're the monkey. . . SANTOS: You kind of nudge over and see what you can do to get the grape. And if the experimenter grabs the token from you, the monkeys quickly learned - aha - I guess I just give them these tokens, and I can get access for food. RAZ: OK. There you go - monkey money. You give me a token. I give you a grape. And then, just to make it a little more interesting, Laurie and her team created a diversified monkey marketplace. SANTOS: They picked things like, you know, Fruit Roll-ups and cereal and. . . RAZ: 'Cause you think bananas, right? SANTOS: Yeah. The monkeys do - they like bananas, but grapes are pretty high. Our monkeys are a bit spoiled. RAZ: So over the course of a day, she'd have different experimenters sell the monkeys food at different prices. SANTOS: By changing the amount of food that each experimenter gave. RAZ: So you send one guy into the cage. Monkey gives him one token. Monkey gets one grape. But then, you send in a second guy. Monkey gives him one token. And monkey gets. . . SANTOS: . . . Two grapes for a token. RAZ: OK, so two different guys, both charging one token, but one gives you one grape, the other gives you two. So the monkeys can actually learn who got the better deal. And so Laurie's question was. . . SANTOS: Do they do the rational thing? So do they go for the most food? Do they go for the best prices? Do they go for the best option even over risk? And the surprising thing was, in all of those cases, the monkeys seemed pretty rational. So if experimenter started offering more than they were offering on previous trials, the monkeys liked that. They considered it like a sale and would shop more at that human experimenter. And the monkeys also took into account how risky the person was. If the person did something different from trial to trial, didn't give what they said they were going to give, then the monkeys took that into account on future trials as well. RAZ: OK, this does not sound dumb to me. This sounds very smart. SANTOS: This sounds pretty smart. And I guess the message that we got pretty quickly was that the monkeys are smart in lots of the same cases that humans are smart. I mean, these are the sorts of rational things that humans do in their own markets. What we were really interested in, though, was whether the monkeys would show the same errors that humans show in the markets, too. So are they irrational in the cases where humans are irrational? RAZ: And so to answer that question, the researchers decided to test out something called prospect theory on the monkeys. And prospect theory, in simple terms, says that humans are wired to avoid risks, specifically losses. Anyway, Laurie's team wanted to figure out if monkeys, like humans, make irrational decisions because they are afraid to lose stuff. So they went back to the monkey lab. SANTOS: And so here is what the monkeys might face. They might get a choice between an experimenter who looks like he's going to give three pieces of food, but in the end, when the monkey trades with him, he takes one away and give the monkeys only two. So two pieces of food are pretty good, but the monkeys get less than they expect. We'd compared how the monkeys did with this guy versus a different guy, who started off with one piece of food. But that guy would then give an extra one that the monkeys didn't expect. So if you're being rational, you shouldn't care between the two guys. They each give you two. You just kind of shop at them at chance. Who cares? They're giving you the same amount. But if you're paying attention to their reference point, what you started with, the first guy seems like a bad deal. You know, he took one away, you though you were going to get three, and you only got two. And what we find is that the monkeys pay attention to what humans pay attention to, which is the status quo. If you're getting less than you expect, it seems like a bad deal even if the overall absolute amount that you get is still pretty good. RAZ: So, I mean, they become totally irrational. SANTOS: That's right. Just in the sense that what an economist would say that monkeys should like is just the absolute amount of food they get. It doesn't matter what they thought they were going to get. But we saw an even more striking effect, not with bonuses, but with losses. So these are cases where the monkeys think they're going to get a lot of food, and they get less. And what we found is that just like humans, the monkeys are averse to losses. So they tend to avoid guys who give them less than they expect even in cases where that guy is, overall, giving them the same amount of food. RAZ: OK. So, wait, you're saying that monkey part of us, right, that that hasn't changed, it hasn't evolved? SANTOS: Yeah. I think that is one thing you can learn from our work, is that whatever strategies we're using for money, especially those strategies that we share with monkeys, those kinds of strategies can't be built in for money per se. They're not for markets or for credit cards. They're just strategies that we had sitting around in our primate brain that we're adapting to money. And that might mean that they lead us astray. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SANTOS: What do we know about other old strategies like this? Well, one thing we know is that they tend to be really hard to overcome. You know, think of our evolutionary predilection for eating sweet things, fatty things like, cheesecake. You can't just shut that off. You can't just look at that dessert cart and say, no, no, no. That looks disgusting to me. We're just built differently. We're going to perceive it as a good thing to go after. My guess is that the same thing is going to be true when humans are perceiving different financial decisions. When you're watching your stocks plummet into the red, when you're watching your house price go down, you're not going to be able to see that in anything but old evolutionary terms. This means that the biases that lead investors to do badly, that lead to the foreclosure crisis are going to be really hard to overcome. So that's the bad news. The question is, is there any good news? I'm supposed to be up here telling you the good news. Well, the good news, I think, is humans are not only smart, we're really inspirationally smart to the rest of the animals in the biological kingdom. We're so good at overcoming our biological limitations. You know, I flew over here in an airplane. I didn't have to try to flap my wings. I'm wearing contact lenses now so that I can see all of you. I don't have to rely on my own nearsightedness. We actually have all of these cases where we overcome our biological limitations through technology and other means, seemingly, pretty easily. But we have to recognize that we have those limitations. And here's the rub - it was Camu who once said that man is the only species who refuses to be what he really is. But the irony is that in might only be in recognizing our limitations that we can really actually overcome them. The hope is that you all will think about your limitations, not necessarily as un-overcome-able, but to recognize them, accept them, and then use the world of design to actually figure them out. That might be the only way that we will really be able to achieve our own human potential and really be the noble species we hope to all be. Thank you. (APPLAUSE)RAZ: Laurie Santos runs the Comparative Cognition Laboratory at Yale. Her full talk is at TED. NPR. org. I guess the moral of the story is you never want to give a credit card to a monkey. SANTOS: That might be a good moral of the story. Whether or not they'd pay you back, I'm not sure. We don't have empirical evidence over it, but my guess is probably look pretty bad. RAZ: Especially not with a high interest rate, you know. SANTOS: Exactly. Yep. Yep. GUY RAZ, HOST:  It's the TED Radio Hour from NPR. I'm Guy Raz. And today on the show, the money paradox.

I'm Scott Simon. The federal government announced a record-breaking, $5 billion settlement this week in a remarkable environmental case. The company involved is Kerr-McGee. Its toxic legacies stretches back 85 years, and it involves scores of sites across the country. NPR's Elizabeth Shogren reports that the government hopes the enormous settlement is going to send a message to polluters that they will pay to clean up a mess. ELIZABETH SHOGREN, BYLINE: Kerr-McGee ran uranium mines in the Navajo Nation wood-treating businesses across the Midwest and East Coast, and a perchlorate plant on a tributary of the nation's largest reservoir, Lake Mead. And it was messy. (SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE)JAMES COLE: Kerr-McGee's business, all over this country, left significant, lasting environmental damage. SHOGREN: James Cole is the deputy U. S. attorney general who announced the plan in a press conference in Washington. The company contaminated Lake Mead with toxic perchlorate, a component of rocket fuel. It exposed people on an Indian reservation and a big-city Chicago to radioactive wastes. It left communities and the federal government to pay for cleanups. Over the decades, the government tried to get the company to pay to clean up. Cole says the company tried to dodge responsibility. It split off its profitable oil and gas business, and sold it for $18 billion to Anadarko Petroleum Corp. The rest of the company filed for bankruptcy. COLE: This plan was intended to isolate and shed these liabilities through a complicated, multistep, corporate reorganization. Had Kerr-McGee gotten away with its scheme, it would have skirted its responsibility for cleaning up contaminated sites around the country. SHOGREN: Instead, a bankruptcy court found that reorganization was fraudulent. And now Kerr-McGee's buyer, Anadarko, will pay the $85 billion tab to clean up Kerr-McGee's pollution, and compensate people who were harmed by it. Among those people were those who lived in a residential community in New Jersey. U. S. attorney Preet Bharara says their homes were built on the company's waste. PREET BHARARA: Those families didn't know that their homes were built on top of pools of toxic waste until 1996, when sludge literally began to bubble up into one resident's basement. SHOGREN: And in the Navajo Nation in Arizona, Kerr-McGee's uranium mines contaminated the water people drink, give their cattle and play in. The tribe even made a comic book to warn children about the danger of swimming in radioactive water. The government says the $5 billion settlement should more than cover the costs of cleaning up the company's toxic legacy. Bharara says the size of the settlement should send a strong message. BHARARA: If you are responsible for 85 years of poisoning the earth, then you are responsible for cleaning it up. SHOGREN: The government says the benefit of settling instead of taking the company to court is that the money will be available as soon as the court OKs the settlement, instead of years in the future. Anadarko declined to record an interview with NPR but in a press release, the company said by settling, it was eliminating the uncertainty the dispute created. The company's stock jumped up significantly after the news. Business analysts say that suggests Anadarko is in good enough shape to pay the $5 billion without crippling itself. Mark Latham is a professor at Vermont Law School who says the settlement shows just how far-reaching the country's toxic waste laws are. MARK LATHAM: You might put off the day of reckoning for years, as was done here. But sooner or later, those efforts are likely to be unsuccessful. And you'll be on the hook for hundreds of millions, if not more. SHOGREN: And Latham says there's a lesson here for big corporations like Anadarko. They should heed the old adage buyer beware.

Don't get all wrapped up trying to figure out the punch line, this is no joke. It's part of some groundbreaking research that will be on display at London's British Museum next month. The team there is using CT scans to uncover the ancient secrets of mummies. John Taylor is curator at the British Museum. And he joined me earlier today to explain. JOHN TAYLOR: So, in fact, we take the mummies to hospitals and we put them through the scanners there, after working hours so we don't take the scanners away from patients who need them. And we've been able to capture astonishingly clear images of the bodies inside the wrappings. CORNISH: Now, tell us a little bit about one of these mummies where you've learned new details. TAYLOR: One of the most interesting mummies is that of a woman named Tamut. We know she was a chantreuse, a singer in the Temple of Karnak, a temple at Modern Luxor in Egypt. And the scans of this mummy have shown an incredible detail: the face of Tamut, we can see her hair and we can see her fingernails and toenails all incredibly well-preserved. And we've learned a lot about her state of health as well. We've discovered that she suffered from fat deposits in her arteries, which could possibly have led to her death. It might have led to heart attack or a stroke. So it seems as though she might have either had this genetic predisposition or it could be she had a high fat diet. CORNISH: When you first saw one of these scans, what was that like for you? I mean, can you remember what was going through your mind? TAYLOR: It's an amazing revelation because I've worked in the museum now for 25 years. And I've worked with these mummies and studied them for a long, long time, and then suddenly, you look at a computer screen and you see the person inside and you've never seen that face before. That is a very powerful moment because it really brings you very close to someone who lived 3,000 years ago. CORNISH: Were there any scans where you and other researchers were kind of peering at them and going, what the heck is that, and like, seeing some unexpected item? TAYLOR: We've seen a lot of things which have puzzled us. One of the mummies actually has a tool inside its skull. And, of course, the standard procedure was for the embalmer to remove the brain before the body was wrapped up. And they would do that by pushing a metal rod up the nose and then pull the brain down through the nostril. It's a pretty revolting concept. But very few of the tools that they used to do that have ever been found. And when we were looking at one of our images, we saw a long rod lying there in the base of this man's skull and we realized that this must be one of the embalmer's tools which broken off during the operation and he'd left it behind. CORNISH: Now, how does this change things for your museum and others? TAYLOR: Well, what is exciting about this is that up till now, we've only really been able to get this kind of information from individual case studies. Maybe one mummy has been scanned and facts have been collected. But what we're looking for now is to compare mummies from different periods, different parts of Egypt and get a real sense of how the population was composed. CORNISH: John Taylor. He's a curator at the British Museum in London. Thank you so much for speaking with us. TAYLOR: Thank you. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:  Did you hear the one about the mummy who went to the hospital?

I'm Audie Cornish. MELISSA BLOCK, HOST: I'm Melissa Block. And today, we're heading to South Texas, which is in the midst of a massive oil boom. In just a few years, that boom has totally transformed once-sleepy communities along a crescent swoosh known as the Eagle Ford Shale. (SOUNDBITE OF A TRAIN)BLOCK: The oil boom has brought a long-dormant rail line back to life. It's become a vital artery. In the heart of the oil boom along the Eagle Ford, the boom has brought unexpected prosperity and a host of new concerns. We're southwest of San Antonio, about 70 miles up from the Mexico border. Brush country, they call it, flat, dry ranchland scrubby with mesquite and parched by drought. Before the boom, jobs here were few, poverty, high. Then, in 2008, the oil company Petrohawk drilled the first discovery well two miles deep into the Eagle Ford Shale and hit big-time. When they announced their success it led to a drilling frenzy. Now after just six years, more than 8,000 oil and gas wells have been drilled along this shale play, with permits for another 5,000. (SOUNDBITE OF A TRAIN)BLOCK: They're pumping more than a million barrels of oil a day from the Eagle Ford, which has quickly vaulted to become the second highest oil producing region in the U. S. (SOUNDBITE OF A TRAIN)BLOCK: Train cars roll in to the Gardendale rail yard bearing miles of pipe, drilling mud, vast quantities of the chemicals and sand used in hydraulic fracturing, or fracking. And the numbers are mind-boggling. Rail yard General Manager Del Randall drives me around in his pickup and points out a Halliburton storage site. DEL RANDALL: That facility, in the first eight months of operation, moved a billion pounds of frack sand. BLOCK: Randall has seen this rail yard turn from a wasteland to a sprawling hub of commerce. RANDALL: This is probably one of the most extensive facilities like this in the country. BLOCK: And really up from just about nothing. RANDALL: Correct. (SOUNDBITE OF A DOOR TONE)BLOCK: To hear how the sudden oil boom has changed the nearby town of Cotulla, Texas, I stop by a modest storefront on a largely abandoned block that serves as Cotulla City Hall. LARRY DOVALINA: I mean it was a rural town. And, like rural America, it was dying, dying on the vine, as they say. BLOCK: Larry Dovalina is city manager overseeing the money as Cotulla's coffers fill. He's seen city revenues from sales taxes rise nearly nine-fold in six years. Back in 2008, the property tax base was about $50 million. DOVALINA: It's going to be somewhere close to $200 million this year. BLOCK: And he projects it'll double again. The revenues will go to beef up infrastructure, water, gas, roads, all the things that are under intense strain with this sudden growth. For people who leased mineral rights on their land to the oil companies, it's meant a windfall. Larry Dovalina recounts a wild story he heard. DOVALINA: This guy took a check to the bank and he told the lady he needed to put check in the bank right away, because it was a check for $100,000. And when the clerk looked at the check she says: Its not $100,000; it's a million. And those stories happen here, too. JAY WATSON: That was true. My wife worked at the bank. (LAUGHTER)WATSON: I can verify that story. BLOCK: That's Jay Watson with the Cotulla Chamber of Commerce. WATSON: It's what they call mailbox money around here. Check comes in the mailbox and you go to the bank, put it in the bank. BLOCK: Jay Watson and his colleague Marianne Hall have both leased land to the oil companies. It's allowed him to buy a retirement home. Lots of people here have money now they never dreamed of. WATSON: I know of one family, an old ranch family that I think they got, like, $30 million just in bonus money. So they went from trying to make ends meet to multi-millionaires in three years. BLOCK: People talk about it? I mean is it sort of known who's come into a huge windfall? MARIANNE HALL: You see a new car and you see a house go up. Or, you know, so you know they've got a little bit of money coming, anyway. WATSON: Well, the community itself doesn't allow people to really to get too pretentious. We. . . (LAUGHTER)WATSON: We bring them back to Earth pretty damn quick. (LAUGHTER)BLOCK: Marianne Hall thinks back to the early days of the boom, which came on so fast, nobody was ready. HALL: I would get a call from a guy coming in with a pipeline crews seismic with 60 people coming in the next day, where do we stay? And you go: Oh, my gosh, there's nowhere. There was not enough hotels. There was nothing so they started putting RV parks and RVs in their yards and field cabins and things like that for them. And that's what happened. It had to grow quick. BLOCK: Do you worry this is all going to dry up? Go bust? HALL: No. Too much here. . . WATSON: No. I, you know, eventually the oil is going to taper off. But it looks like to me maybe 20 years down the line, or whatever. So. . . (SOUNDBITE OF A VEHICLE)BLOCK: The main complaints you here in Cotulla are about the heavy truck traffic the Eagle Ford boom has brought with it: 18-wheelers chewing these rural roads and causing accidents, a number of them fatal. And with the influx of thousands of outsiders, the Sheriff's Department is contending with a spike in crime: theft, drugs and prostitution. Sergeant Rickey Galvan pulls up in one of the Sheriff's Department shiny, new Chevy Tahoes. He was born and raised in Cotulla and remembers a very different time. SERGEANT RICKY GALVAN: Before, a handshake meant something down here, not anymore. Now you have to lock your doors. So you have to lock your car, take your keys if you go to the store. Before, you didn't have to do that. You walk into the store, leave your vehicle running. Not anymore, that's changed. BLOCK: And what will the future of towns like Cotulla look like? Texans know well the cycles of boom and bust, places that were once the hot new thing for oil explorations that are now ghost towns. And that's the fate former Cotulla Mayor and Judge Leodoro Martinez hopes his town can avoid. He takes me out for a drive and we talk about his deep roots here. JUDGE LEODORO MARTINEZ: This is where my family grew up. (LAUGHTER)MARTINEZ: My grandparents worked all these lands. BLOCK: His grandparents were sharecroppers. Martinez grew up picking cotton, watermelons, onions. Now some of that old farmland is being turned into a sports park that will bear his name. MARTINEZ: All of this was just empty. There was nothing here. BLOCK: But now, pump jacks dip to the ground, like giant mechanical birds. Bright orange gas flares burn high above the ranchland. You'll see huge tank batteries for oil storage and disposal wells for their fracking fluids. And we pass one motel after another, 19 already up for being built where there used to be just three. MARTINEZ: Well, yeah. Look at that. Yeah. Somebody knows something because they keep building them. We can't quite figure it out. Everybody is concerned that at the end of the day, that there's going to be a lot of hotels and not enough business. But I'm sure somebody knows something. BLOCK: Leodoro Martinez thinks a lot about where this is all heading. He's chairman of the Eagle Ford Consortium, a group of local stakeholders who are working with the oil companies to try to make the most of economic development and try to make it sustainable. MARTINEZ: I've always called it wanting to be normal. (LAUGHTER)MARTINEZ: You know, having what other communities have. BLOCK: So your hope would be that the oil money could help you do that. MARTINEZ: Yes. In my lifetime we're never going to see another opportunity, I mean to be able to get there. It's not going to happen. (SOUNDBITE OF A SHUTTING VEHICLE DOOR)BLOCK: Our last stop in Cotulla takes us to Darrell Brownlow's thousand-acre ranch. DARRELL BROWNLOW: Now you see a roadrunner crossing road in front of U. S. BLOCK: Here you get a clear sense of the tradeoffs the oil industry brings. Brownlow's grandfather bought this land in the 1940s. Darrell and his father used to run cattle here. His father died last year. And with the drought, Darrell had to sell off his herd. Now, he's leased part of his land to Chesapeake Energy. (SOUNDBITE OF MACHINERY)BLOCK: Brownlow takes me by the two pump jacks working. Gas is flaring off nearby with a sign warning of possible emissions of poison gas, the extremely toxic hydrogen sulfide. (SOUNDBITE OF FLARING)BROWNLOW: There's a siren, you know if there was an upset condition that would wail. BLOCK: As we drive passed mesquite trees and a white-tailed deer bounding away, Brownlow looks out at the industry that's sprung up all around him. BROWNLOW: And you can see the flaring over there. And at night, it's quite a site when you get up on top of the deer blinds, and you can see these little glowing embers you know, all over. Historically and at night when you climb up in the deer blind, you watch the sunset, you know it was nothing as far as you could see. It was beautiful. BLOCK: Does that bother you in any way? I mean, when you think about how it used to be, right, just open space. And now, you're looking around and you're seeing industry mixed in all - everywhere you look, all around you. BROWNLOW: It's progress. It has provided opportunity beyond belief, beyond what anybody could have imagined. BLOCK: Chesapeake Energy has dug a deep well on this dusty ranch, and a three-acre pond to supply water for fracking operations. That's a rare thing to have in drought-stricken Texas. It'll allow Brownlow to irrigate, and the oil money means he can afford to rebuild this ranch and bring back cattle. BROWNLOW: I think of my dad, almost a testament. Dad, we're gonna get the cattle back on here. And he's not here with us, but Pop is upstairs looking down at us and he's going to be happy about it. And we got one shot at this and you got to make sure it's done right. You know, what's this place gonna be like 20 or 30 or 50 years from now? It's what we do with it today that matters. BLOCK: There are, of course, a lot of environmental and health concerns that accompany oil production in operations like those along the Eagle Ford Shale. Tomorrow on the program, I'll talk with an investigative reporter who spent months reporting on air pollution connected to the oil industry in South Texas and the health effects on some residents. JIM MORRIS: Headaches, nausea, breathing difficulties, nosebleeds. And when you look at the science on some of the chemicals that are coming out of these operations, you see those are the very symptoms that would be expected to be associated with emissions from the oil and gas industry. BLOCK: We'll have that conversation tomorrow. You're listening to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:  From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Audie Cornish.

There was not enough hotels. There was nothing so they started putting RV parks and RVs in their yards and field cabins and things like that for them. And that's what happened. It had to grow quick. BLOCK: Do you worry this is all going to dry up? Go bust? HALL: No. Too much here. . . WATSON: No. I, you know, eventually the oil is going to taper off. But it looks like to me maybe 20 years down the line, or whatever. So. . . (SOUNDBITE OF A VEHICLE) BLOCK: The main complaints you here in Cotulla are about the heavy truck traffic the Eagle Ford boom has brought with it: 18-wheelers chewing these rural roads and causing accidents, a number of them fatal. And with the influx of thousands of outsiders, the Sheriff's Department is contending with a spike in crime: theft, drugs and prostitution. Sergeant Rickey Galvan pulls up in one of the Sheriff's Department shiny, new Chevy Tahoes. He was born and raised in Cotulla and remembers a very different time. SERGEANT RICKY GALVAN: Before, a handshake meant something down here, not anymore. Now you have to lock your doors. So you have to lock your car, take your keys if you go to the store. Before, you didn't have to do that. You walk into the store, leave your vehicle running. Not anymore, that's changed. BLOCK: And what will the future of towns like Cotulla look like? Texans know well the cycles of boom and bust, places that were once the hot new thing for oil explorations that are now ghost towns. And that's the fate former Cotulla Mayor and Judge Leodoro Martinez hopes his town can avoid. He takes me out for a drive and we talk about his deep roots here. JUDGE LEODORO MARTINEZ: This is where my family grew up. (LAUGHTER) MARTINEZ: My grandparents worked all these lands. BLOCK: His grandparents were sharecroppers. Martinez grew up picking cotton, watermelons, onions. Now some of that old farmland is being turned into a sports park that will bear his name. MARTINEZ: All of this was just empty. There was nothing here. BLOCK: But now, pump jacks dip to the ground, like giant mechanical birds. Bright orange gas flares burn high above the ranchland. You'll see huge tank batteries for oil storage and disposal wells for their fracking fluids. And we pass one motel after another, 19 already up for being built where there used to be just three. MARTINEZ: Well, yeah. Look at that. Yeah. Somebody knows something because they keep building them. We can't quite figure it out. Everybody is concerned that at the end of the day, that there's going to be a lot of hotels and not enough business. But I'm sure somebody knows something. BLOCK: Leodoro Martinez thinks a lot about where this is all heading. He's chairman of the Eagle Ford Consortium, a group of local stakeholders who are working with the oil companies to try to make the most of economic development and try to make it sustainable. MARTINEZ: I've always called it wanting to be normal. (LAUGHTER) MARTINEZ: You know, having what other communities have. BLOCK: So your hope would be that the oil money could help you do that. MARTINEZ: Yes. In my lifetime we're never going to see another opportunity, I mean to be able to get there. It's not going to happen. (SOUNDBITE OF A SHUTTING VEHICLE DOOR) BLOCK: Our last stop in Cotulla takes us to Darrell Brownlow's thousand-acre ranch. DARRELL BROWNLOW: Now you see a roadrunner crossing road in front of U. S. BLOCK: Here you get a clear sense of the tradeoffs the oil industry brings. Brownlow's grandfather bought this land in the 1940s. Darrell and his father used to run cattle here. His father died last year. And with the drought, Darrell had to sell off his herd. Now, he's leased part of his land to Chesapeake Energy. (SOUNDBITE OF MACHINERY) BLOCK: Brownlow takes me by the two pump jacks working. Gas is flaring off nearby with a sign warning of possible emissions of poison gas, the extremely toxic hydrogen sulfide. (SOUNDBITE OF FLARING) BROWNLOW: There's a siren, you know if there was an upset condition that would wail. BLOCK: As we drive passed mesquite trees and a white-tailed deer bounding away, Brownlow looks out at the industry that's sprung up all around him. BROWNLOW: And you can see the flaring over there. And at night, it's quite a site when you get up on top of the deer blinds, and you can see these little glowing embers you know, all over. Historically and at night when you climb up in the deer blind, you watch the sunset, you know it was nothing as far as you could see. It was beautiful. BLOCK: Does that bother you in any way? I mean, when you think about how it used to be, right, just open space. And now, you're looking around and you're seeing industry mixed in all - everywhere you look, all around you. BROWNLOW: It's progress. It has provided opportunity beyond belief, beyond what anybody could have imagined. BLOCK: Chesapeake Energy has dug a deep well on this dusty ranch, and a three-acre pond to supply water for fracking operations. That's a rare thing to have in drought-stricken Texas. It'll allow Brownlow to irrigate, and the oil money means he can afford to rebuild this ranch and bring back cattle. BROWNLOW: I think of my dad, almost a testament. Dad, we're gonna get the cattle back on here. And he's not here with us, but Pop is upstairs looking down at us and he's going to be happy about it. And we got one shot at this and you got to make sure it's done right. You know, what's this place gonna be like 20 or 30 or 50 years from now? It's what we do with it today that matters. BLOCK: There are, of course, a lot of environmental and health concerns that accompany oil production in operations like those along the Eagle Ford Shale. Tomorrow on the program, I'll talk with an investigative reporter who spent months reporting on air pollution connected to the oil industry in South Texas and the health effects on some residents. JIM MORRIS: Headaches, nausea, breathing difficulties, nosebleeds. And when you look at the science on some of the chemicals that are coming out of these operations, you see those are the very symptoms that would be expected to be associated with emissions from the oil and gas industry. BLOCK: We'll have that conversation tomorrow.

Now you might not know that word, but you probably feel it if one is directed at you. These are those little every day comments or questions or actions that tend to indicate a subtle form of bias. Somebody says, you know, you're awfully pretty for a lesbian. You speak so well, for a black person. Or somebody asks you for tech tips because you're Asian-American. Well, we got so many responses on Facebook and Twitter last week when we did a shout out asking for examples of this that we decided we had to return to this issue. But this time we decided to focus on microaggressions in the workplace. Derald Sue is back with us to tell us more about it. He's a professor of psychology and education at Columbia University Teachers College. He wrote the book \"Microaggressions in Everyday Life: Race, Gender, and Sexual Orientation,\" with us from our bureau in New York. Professor Sue, thanks so much for joining us once again. DERALD SUE: Well, thank you for having me. MARTIN: Also joining us is Luke Visconti. He's the founder and CEO of DiversityInc, and he writes a column called Ask the White Guy for DiversityInc magazine. He's with us from his offices in Princeton, New Jersey. Luke Visconti, it's been a while, but thank you so much for joining us once again. LUKE VISCONTI: Hi, thanks for having me on again, Michel. MARTIN: So as we mentioned, last week we asked listeners to share some of their experiences with microaggressions. And I want to share one of those stories, this one from listener Tye (ph) who lives in Springfield, Ohio. TYE: All my life basically I've been told that I don't act, sound, dress like a black person. You know, I'm 28 now and I still hear it constantly. My response is always, well, how are black people supposed to act? Please tell me. MARTIN: Well, professor, you know, she - and she made it clear that she doesn't just hear this from white people. She does also hear this from African-Americans. So tell me a little bit about what do you think is going on here when someone says something like that? SUE: Well, what's going on here is that people have a preconceived notion or stereotype that generally is negative about African-Americans, Asian-Americans, Latino Hispanic Americans and they - when you act differently from the negative image that they have of you, they show shock, surprise and oftentimes will say something like you speak good English. And it's meant as a compliment, but in some sense it undermines your racial ethnic identity by saying that you're a perpetual alien in your own country. You're not very bright or intelligent, and you represent the exception. MARTIN: So Luke, you founded a company that focuses on encouraging diversity in the business world. So let's say somebody says this to you and you're in a job interview? I mean, it's one thing if you're a student and somebody says this to you in class, you can say what do you mean by that or what are you trying to say - or you can, you know, do whatever. But let's say you hear this in a sticky work situation - what do you say? What do you recommend? VISCONTI: Well, especially if you're in a job interview, if you've done your preparation and looked at the company's website, looked for the CEO's comments on diversity - and they should be there, and if they're not, that's a signal. If you're at a job interview you might be able to write it off as poor behavior on one individual person, not the company's way of doing things. But if you're in the job and you're hearing this from the supervisor, that's something that you then have to make the decision - do you take the person aside and gently kind of coach them a little bit about why that wouldn't sound the way they thought it would sound. MARTIN: Professor, so what do you think about that? SUE: Well, you know, how you deal with it depends a lot in terms of the power differential and the consequences. When we studied, you know, people of color dealing with racial microaggressions, what we found was over 50 percent of them chose to ignore or do nothing about it because of the fear and consequences that they would not get the job, would not get the promotion. There is something that we've been teaching people of color about how to handle this in a very subtle, indirect way. Let me give you an example. When I'm complimented for speaking good English, what is generally being communicated to me is that I am a perpetual alien in my own country. I'm not a true American. I used to get very upset about that, but the way I undermine that message is to simply say, thank you, I hope so, I was born here. What I am doing is to, you know, to acknowledge that they perceive, on a conscious level, that it's a compliment. But I undermine the meta, hidden communication and I try to plant a seed that hopefully will make sense to them later on. MARTIN: Luke, here's something we heard from listener Diego (ph) in Knoxville, Tennessee, and this is a classic. I mean, this is something you've written about many times in your column. And Diego says, people often ask me where I'm from, and the natural response for me is to say New York - and I'm always asked right after, OK, but where are you from or people will roll their eyes and say but where are you from. OK, so what's going on here Luke and tell me how you recommend that people deal with this? VISCONTI: I think this is a very important thing that goes along with what the professor's saying - that the person who's asking that question and is insistent on it is usually trying to isolate a person. And I think the professor's words - make them an alien in their own country - are very correct. I always - I get this question in places - where are you from - and I will say the most local thing, Princeton, I'm from New Jersey, and let the person ask two or three times more. Sometimes it's an innocent question, more often than not it's flowing from a precision of perceived superior power to a position of perceived inferior power. And it's a way of putting somebody down, dismissing them, putting them in their place, making them appear small, putting them at ease. It's not correct behavior. MARTIN: Well, I think some people might say I'm just trying to figure out if we know anybody in common. VISCONTI: That's usually spoken in a different way, and you can usually tell the difference. I am an optimist, but most of those questions I don't find to be positive. MARTIN: So what do you do, particularly if the person asking - let's say you're new at a workplace, which is the kind of - the situation where in which that's likely to occur or the person asking you this is somebody of a higher rank - what do you do? What do you recommend? VISCONTI: Well, I think, like the professor said, you at times have to roll with this. And it's uncomfortable, but you can ask the question back I think in a way that is not offensive to helpfully make that person think a little bit about the question that they're asking. I wrote a column about this where I was asked this question by a person who clearly didn't think I belonged in the room. And I kept deflecting it until she finally burst out and told me about how her family had been in Princeton since the settlers. So she was just really communicating that I didn't belong here. I wasn't part of the club. And she wanted to let me know that. MARTIN: Well. . . SUE: Michel. . . MARTIN: Go again, Professor Sue. SUE: If I can - yeah. If I can say something that really is important for us to look at - a lot of times what we're saying is that how can people of color, how can women employees in the workplace handle microaggressions, and it's almost like we put the onus of responsibility for any change upon them when it is the decision-makers, the organizations with their biased policies, practices and structures that are causing the harm. So the question I would ask generally is that - what are the obligations, what are of the responsibilities of the decision-makers and the businesses and industry in terms of altering and changing the climate so that microaggressions do not occur. MARTIN: I think that's nice once you already got the job and you're the boss. So if you're the one - you're trying to - I think we're trying to sort of help people who are not yet in a position where they feel like they have that power. Point taken, take your point entirely, but then again, like a lot of people are in vulnerable positions in the workplace right now and we want to give them some tools. Final. . . SUE: And they have to - they really have to find support groups with one another. Otherwise they feel that they're isolated, alienated, lonely in the situation. They've got to really find people who understand what I call the minority experience - what it is like to constantly face this constant onslaught of microaggressions that derogate and denigrate and assail their racial ethnic identities. MARTIN: I'm going to end with a comment from Sean (ph) in San Diego. Sean is transgender and gets a lot of personal questions from acquaintances. And he writes if it's a coworker who didn't know before or if it's somebody that a friend introduced me to or something - if they start asking me questions that I don't think are appropriate to answer, I will call them out and say, look, that's not something you'd asked somebody else or I will ask them a personal question in response. So that's Sean's word of wisdom. So thank you both so much for telling us more about this important issue. Luke Visconti is the founder and CEO of DiversityInc. He's author of the column Ask the White Guy. Derald Sue is author of the book \"Microaggressions in Everyday Life: Race, Gender, and Sexual Orientation. \" He joined us from our bureau in New York.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)VIGELAND: Carlos Watson is the co-founder of the online magazine Ozy, and each week he joins us to talk about what is new and what is next. Welcome back, Carlos. CARLOS WATSON: Tess, good to be with you. VIGELAND: So let's start with my least favorite subject on Earth, shall we, math? WATSON: Don't say that, Tess, don't say that. VIGELAND: Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear. Well, I think I'm not alone in my feelings here, but you found a French mathematician who is trying to spice things up. WATSON: He is. His name is Cedric Villani, but he's popularly referred to as Math's Lady Gaga. So he dresses like a 19th century aristocrat - wild, colorful, plume-y shirts and other sorts of things, but he's an incredible mathematician. In fact, he won the highest prize in math, called the Fields Medal, which some people say is like the equivalent of the Nobel Prize for math. But gave it all up a couple years ago and said, I want to spend my life popularizing math with the Tesses and the Carloses of this world. VIGELAND: Fair enough. I do have to ask with the Lady Gaga comparison, can we safely assume that he knows the old rule that before you walk out of the house, you do some subtraction and take one thing off? WATSON: You know what? He's not about subtraction. He's all about addition. I love your pun. So as he gets ready to come out with a book next year called \"The Living Theorem,\" he's going to be doing a lot more over here in the States. VIGELAND: So he wins this big prize, but he decides he wants to make the world love math. Where did that transition come? Why did he decide that he wanted to become essentially a math ambassador? WATSON: Part of it had to do with his family upbringing. So he grew up in a small town in France, son of philosophers and composers and artists. So his own turn to math wasn't immediately predictable, and he found that as he tried to discuss his work with family and friends, they often had an immediate wall up, not dissimilar, Tess, from your feeling when the topic first came up. So he thought there was more he could, and whether he did that through speeches, through new workbooks, he often pairs up, Tess, with a comic. He thought he had the ability to kind of really bring it alive in a very exciting way. VIGELAND: So if only I had had a comic book in fourth grade I could be a mathematician. (LAUGHTER)WATSON: Tess, there's still time. You could always start late. VIGELAND: Fair enough. I'll start studying this weekend. OK. So we've done math. We might as well bring in some science here. If you've ever had a fascination with microscopes, you've got a guy to see. WATSON: So there's a young Stanford professor named Manu Prakash, 37 years old, realized the number of infectious diseases, particularly in developing parts of the world, like Malaria where 3. 5 billion people are at risk of it. In terms of determining that they have it, the big gating item is often access to a really good microscope. That a really good microscope often costs $200, it's bulky, it doesn't work in remote villages, and so he came up with a 50 cent microscope, which he calls the foldoscope. VIGELAND: Foldoscope. And just how big are these things? How do they work? WATSON: It looks like a colored piece of cardboard that ultimately folds into something as thin as kind of a big bookmark. And he's tested it in a variety of different countries and continents, and he even tested it's durability by literally stomping on it and throwing it out of a third story window. The other piece is in making science education more interesting, because now for 50 cents, they've got a powerful tool that they can explore with, where as in the past, at 200 bucks a piece, who's going to get access to that in a relatively low income country? VIGELAND: Fascinating. Carlos Watson is the co-founder of the online magazine Ozy. And Carlos, I think we've done a pretty good job of getting people hopped up about science and math. So we'll get the books out right away this weekend. WATSON: Hey, the phrase of the day is STEM education - Science, Technology, Engineering and Math. VIGELAND: All right. Thanks so much, Carlos. WATSON: Good to be with you, Tess. VIGELAND: And you can explore all of the stories we talk about at npr. org/newandnext. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) TESS VIGELAND, HOST:   It's time for the New and the Next.

So he dresses like a 19th century aristocrat - wild, colorful, plume-y shirts and other sorts of things, but he's an incredible mathematician. In fact, he won the highest prize in math, called the Fields Medal, which some people say is like the equivalent of the Nobel Prize for math. But gave it all up a couple years ago and said, I want to spend my life popularizing math with the Tesses and the Carloses of this world. VIGELAND: Fair enough. I do have to ask with the Lady Gaga comparison, can we safely assume that he knows the old rule that before you walk out of the house, you do some subtraction and take one thing off? WATSON: You know what? He's not about subtraction. He's all about addition. I love your pun. So as he gets ready to come out with a book next year called \"The Living Theorem,\" he's going to be doing a lot more over here in the States. VIGELAND: So he wins this big prize, but he decides he wants to make the world love math. Where did that transition come? Why did he decide that he wanted to become essentially a math ambassador? WATSON: Part of it had to do with his family upbringing. So he grew up in a small town in France, son of philosophers and composers and artists. So his own turn to math wasn't immediately predictable, and he found that as he tried to discuss his work with family and friends, they often had an immediate wall up, not dissimilar, Tess, from your feeling when the topic first came up. So he thought there was more he could, and whether he did that through speeches, through new workbooks, he often pairs up, Tess, with a comic. He thought he had the ability to kind of really bring it alive in a very exciting way. VIGELAND: So if only I had had a comic book in fourth grade I could be a mathematician. (LAUGHTER) WATSON: Tess, there's still time. You could always start late. VIGELAND: Fair enough. I'll start studying this weekend. OK. So we've done math. We might as well bring in some science here. If you've ever had a fascination with microscopes, you've got a guy to see. WATSON: So there's a young Stanford professor named Manu Prakash, 37 years old, realized the number of infectious diseases, particularly in developing parts of the world, like Malaria where 3. 5 billion people are at risk of it. In terms of determining that they have it, the big gating item is often access to a really good microscope. That a really good microscope often costs $200, it's bulky, it doesn't work in remote villages, and so he came up with a 50 cent microscope, which he calls the foldoscope. VIGELAND: Foldoscope. And just how big are these things? How do they work? WATSON: It looks like a colored piece of cardboard that ultimately folds into something as thin as kind of a big bookmark. And he's tested it in a variety of different countries and continents, and he even tested it's durability by literally stomping on it and throwing it out of a third story window. The other piece is in making science education more interesting, because now for 50 cents, they've got a powerful tool that they can explore with, where as in the past, at 200 bucks a piece, who's going to get access to that in a relatively low income country? VIGELAND: Fascinating. Carlos Watson is the co-founder of the online magazine Ozy. And Carlos, I think we've done a pretty good job of getting people hopped up about science and math. So we'll get the books out right away this weekend. WATSON: Hey, the phrase of the day is STEM education - Science, Technology, Engineering and Math. VIGELAND: All right. Thanks so much, Carlos. WATSON: Good to be with you, Tess. VIGELAND: And you can explore all of the stories we talk about at npr. org/newandnext.

I'm Terry Gross. There's a lot of theories about why food allergies, asthma, celiac disease and intestinal disorders like Crohn's disease have been on the rise. My guest, Dr. Martin Blaser, speculates that it may be connected to the overuse of antibiotics, which has resulted in killing off strains of bacteria that typically live in the gut. Blaser is an expert on the human microbe biome, which is the collection of bacteria, viruses, fungi and other microbes that live in and on the body. In fact, about 70 to 90 percent of all the cells in the human body aren't human at all; they're microorganisms. Blaser is the director of the Human Microbiome Program and former chair of medicine at NYU. And he's the former president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America. His new book is called \"Missing Microbes: How the Overuse of Antibiotics is Fueling Our Modern Plagues. \"He says that with the overuse of antibiotics, as well as some other now-common practices like Caesarian sections - he'll explain the connection a little later - we've entered a danger zone, a no man's land between the world of our ancient microbiome and an uncharted modern world. Dr. Martin Blaser, welcome to FRESH AIR. So when there are imbalances in the microbiome, things can go wrong, and you say that scientists now are beginning to think that some of what's often described as the modern plagues of medicine today, that some of those might be caused by imbalances of these microbes. So what are the, quote, \"modern plagues\" that you're talking about? MARTIN BLASER: Yeah, and that's a good place to start. Since World War II we've seen big rises in a number of diseases: asthma, allergies, food allergies, wheat allergy, juvenile diabetes, obesity, autism. These are all diseases that have gone up dramatically in the last 50 or 70 years. And one of the questions is: Why are they going up? Are they going up for 10 different reasons? Or perhaps there's one reason that's fueling all of them. GROSS: And your theory is that one reason might be the microbiome? BLASER: My theory is that the one reason is the changing microbiome, that we evolved a certain stable situation with our microbiome, and with the modern advances of modern life, including modern medical practices, we have been disrupting the microbiome, and there's evidence for that, especially early in life, and it's changing how our children develop. That's my big theory. That's what I expound in the book. GROSS: Well, I will say that people who are involved in environmental issues think that it's, you know, toxins in the environment that are causing a lot of these, you know, quote, modern plagues; and people who deal with food and nutrition issues think that it's, like, you know, bad nutrition and, you know, fatty foods and fast food, empty calories that's causing a lot of today's modern plagues. And your specialty is the human microbiome, and you think it's that. So you know, I just wanted to point that out to everybody; everybody thinks it's from their field, yeah. BLASER: I don't discount those, and in fact nothing says that causation has to be exclusive. GROSS: Right. BLASER: Causation could be additive. And in fact we have experiments in mice where, since we were very interested in obesity, if we put mice on a high-fat diet, they gain weight, they get fat. If we put them on antibiotics early in life, they also get fat. And if we put them on both together, they get very fat. And we've done this in male mice. We've done this in female mice. It's clear that the effects of the antibiotics potentiate the effects of the high-fat diet. So it's not - we're not letting high-fat diet off the hook. We're saying there's another factor there. GROSS: Well, that's really interesting, and why would antibiotics contribute to obesity? BLASER: Yeah, well, I'm very glad you asked that question. We've been interested in this for more than 10 years, and it began with the - all of a sudden the light bulb went off. We know that farmers have been feeding antibiotics to their farm animals, to their livestock for almost 70 years. And the reason they do that is that it promotes their growth. They grow bigger faster. They use their food more efficiently to convert food calories into body mass. And one day I thought, well, if farmers are using antibiotics to promote the growth in their livestock, is it possible that the antibiotics we're using in children are doing the same thing? And that's why we began to do studies in mice. GROSS: Now, I thought the antibiotics in farm animals were being used to prevent them from getting sick because they're - in factory farming the animals are so close together, it's a very unhealthy situation, and it's easy to get sick, and then it's easy for disease to spread. BLASER: Yes, that's true that it is - that just as you say, because they're close together, there's a lot of contagion. But the reason that the farmers are using the antibiotics is to promote growth. And again, there's a literature going back to the 1940s that shows that the use of sub-therapeutic antibiotics, these aren't therapeutic levels, these are sub-therapeutic levels, they're efficient at increasing growth. And in reality the farmers and the farm scientists figured out a lot of this stuff years ago, and in one sense we're rediscovering it because the question is: Why should it work? Why does that work? And then it brings us back to the microbiome and the idea that there's a choreography, there's a normal developmental cycle of the microbiome from birth over the first few years of life. Especially the first three years appear to be the most important. And that's how nature has - how we have evolved together so that we can maximize health and create a new generation, which is nature's great purpose. And because of modern practices we have disrupted that, and then the question is: Does that have consequence? And our studies in mice show that it does have consequences. We've done epidemiologic studies in people that show that some of these modern practices are increasing the risk of obesity as well. GROSS: You mentioned that the microbiome is developed during the first three years of life. And there's something you write about in the book that just, I hadn't heard this before, I found it so interesting, that when the baby passes through the birth canal that it develops some of its microbiome. I want you explain that. BLASER: So as far as we know, when the baby is inside the womb, it is apparently sterile. There are some people who actually question this, too, but the big moment of truth is when the membranes rupture, the water breaks, and the baby starts coming out. And that's where they first get exposed to the bacteria of the world. And the first bacteria they are exposed to is their mother's bacteria in the birth canal. So as labor proceeds, the babies are in contact with the microbes lining their mother's vagina, and as they're going out, they're covered by these bacteria. They swallow the bacteria; it's on their skin. There are a soup of these bacteria. That's their initial exposure to the world of bacteria. GROSS: And you're saying that's a good thing, that's an important thing. BLASER: Well, that's how mammals have been doing it for the last 150 million years, whether they're dolphins or elephants or humans. And that's how it's been done, and we know a little bit about what those bacteria are. The most common bacteria are lactobacillus. And there's evidence that over the course of pregnancy, the microbiome in the vagina changes, just as many other parts of the body are changing, the microbiome is changing in its composition in terms of maximizing lactobacilli. And these are bacteria that eat lactose, which is the main component of milk. So the baby's mouth is filled with lactobacilli. The first thing that happens is they go up against their mom's breast and they inoculate the nipple with lactobacilli, and now milk and lactobacilli go into the new baby, and that's the foundation for their microbiome, and that's how they start their life. GROSS: And what - does the lactobacilli have a protective function? BLASER: People have been studying lactobacilli and bifidobacteria, that's another class or organisms the baby gets from their mothers. But there's been a lot of study for many years showing many different beneficial effects, and these are the foundation of the microbiome that then gets later built on as babies experience more and more organisms. And so you could project that if they didn't acquire these organisms, or if they didn't acquire them normally or at the normal time, then the foundations might be a little shaky, and that's exactly what - one of the points that I've proposed. GROSS: So you're proposing that Caesarian births might compromise the microbiome of the baby? BLASER: Well, actually, a very important study was done by Maria Gloria Dominguez and Rob Knight, and I think it's particularly important because Gloria is my wife. She did a study of moms who had C-sections or moms who gave birth vaginally, and shortly after birth, they compared the microbiomes in the babies that came out. And the babies that were born vaginally, their microbiome, not surprisingly, looked like the mom's vagina everywhere in the body - in their GI tract, on their skin, in their mouth. But the babies born by C-section, their microbiome looked like skin, and it didn't even necessarily look like the mom's skin. Maybe it was somebody else in the operating room. So it's clear that the microbiome is different immediately depending on the kind of birth. GROSS: So it's different, but we don't know for sure what that difference means? BLASER: We don't know what that means, but there have been more and more epidemiologic studies asking the question really for the first time: Are there long-term health consequences of being born by C-section? We did a study in England, a cohort of more than 10,000 children was enrolled in the early 1990s in which the investigators followed these kids for a number of years, took lots of measurements, and we asked the question, was there a different in how - their rate of getting fat or getting obese when they were three, seven, 15, whether they were born by C-section or vaginally. And our studies showed that kids born by C-section were more likely to have increased fat than the other kids. And this is one of four studies that has appeared in the last two years showing exactly the same thing: in Boston; our study in England; a study in Canada; a study in Brazil, all showing the same thing. GROSS: So you mention a very do-it-yourself kind of compensatory procedure of using cotton gauze. Would you explain that? BLASER: Well, this was actually - this was my wife Gloria's idea, and that is that if babies born by C-section are deprived of the natural microbiota that they would have gotten through birth canal delivery, why shouldn't we restore that? And so she's done - she's conducting an experiment, it's been approved by the Institutional Review Board, in which she has three groups of mothers: vaginal birth; C-section birth; and then C-section with a swab in the vagina. Now when the baby is born, the baby gets swabbed with this cotton swab with vaginal content so as to restore that which has been missed by the C-section. GROSS: It's too soon to see what the results are, right? BLASER: She's just analyzing the data now, and she's going to present this work at a big national meeting next month. GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is Dr. Martin Blaser, and he studies the role of bacteria in human disease. He's the director of the Human Microbiome Program at NYU and the author of the new book \"Missing Microbes,\" which is about the human microbiome and the microbiome is the collection of microorganisms - bacteria, fungi, viruses and other microorganisms - in our body, some of which are very helpful, some of them not so much. Let's take a short break, and then we'll talk some more. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)GROSS: This is FRESH AIR, and if you're just joining us, my guest is Dr. Martin Blaser, and we're talking about the human microbiome, and that's the collection of microorganisms - bacteria, viruses, fungi and other microorganisms - that live in the body and perform a lot of functions in the body and sometimes get invaded by not-so-good microorganisms. His new book is called \"Missing Microbes,\" and he's the director of the Human Microbiome Program at NYU and the former president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America. You're concerned that women who are delivering a baby are often prescribed antibiotics. I assume that's to prevent infection, which can be, you know, deadly. What's your concern? BLASER: Well, I have to go back a couple steps and go back to the beginning of the age of antibiotics, when people were dying of very awful infections and antibiotics were miraculous. I mean they were one of the great miracles of the 20th century, and my specialty is infectious diseases. That's - we love antibiotics. But because they were so miraculous, people said, well, let's just start using them for this, and let's use them for that. And everybody thought if there's even a tiny bit of benefit, it's worthwhile using them, because no one thought that there was any biological cost to antibiotics. There might be some short-term effects, people thought. We knew that people got an upset stomach, or maybe they'd get a skin rash, but then when you stopped the antibiotics, everybody assumed that everything would just bounce back for normal. But in fact there was essentially no data that that was correct, and we now have more and more data that it is not correct, that things do not bounce back to normal, and in fact why should they, because an antibiotic is a powerful agent that its job is to inhibit or kill bacteria. So the antibiotic changes the composition that's present in the body, and some of the organisms will go down. Others will go up in compensation. And some of  them will go down to zero. And when they go to zero, they don't come back. They're extinct. GROSS: So relate that to giving a woman in childbirth or just after childbirth antibiotics. BLASER: So there's a very serious infection of children called infection by Group B Strep. It's an important infection of newborns. And it was found that if you give - if women have Group B Strep in the vagina, or they're carrying it in their vagina or their gastrointestinal tract, if you give them penicillin just before the moment of birth, you can pretty much prevent Group B Strep infection. So that was considered to be a great breakthrough. One of the problems is that to prevent any single case of Group B Strep infection, we have to treat about 200 mothers, and thus their 200 children as well. And so the question is, if there was even a little biological cost in those 200 women, it's possible that that could outweigh some of or all of the benefit of - in that one child in which it's prevented. So everybody was looking at the benefit of the antibiotic but not really calculating the cost. And once you assume that there might be a cost, then you can begin to more accurately decide should we do this procedure or not, or should we improve our diagnostics, so instead of treating one in 200, maybe we should only treat one in 10. GROSS: So are you concerned that if a baby is born without a kind of full and varied microbiome, either because of antibiotics or because it was a Caesarian birth, and again a lot of this is still very speculative, that if they're born without that full, varied microbiome, that they will never be able to develop it? BLASER: What we know about development is that there are developmental windows that you have to go through, various stages, that it's not random. And there are just times. We know that for the - how tall kids become, for example, and we know that about their development of intelligence. And so I'm concerned that the microbiome is part of our whole developmental process, and if we disrupt it early, there are potentially consequences. These are difficult to study in humans. You can study them through big epidemiologic studies, such as I described, or you can study them in experimental animals. And that's why we do a lot of work with mice. GROSS: So you were describing your concern that if a woman during childbirth or an infant is given antibiotics, that might affect the baby's microbiome, and who knows how long that would last, the effects of that would last, maybe a short time, maybe forever, we don't really know yet. But you're concerned about the imbalance it would create. A lot of children get ear infections, and as a result of the ear infections they get antibiotics. And for some children it's recurrent ear infections, which means more doses of antibiotics. What are your concerns about the ear infections and the antibiotics? BLASER: So that's a very important issue because as you point out, ear infections are very common in children, and in the United States we're giving a very high percentage of these kids antibiotics every time they have an ear infection. And that's not the only way to practice medicine. First, we know that most of those ear infections are not caused by bacteria at all; they're caused by viruses. And antibiotics don't work against viral infections. That's very clear. So one of the problems is that the doctor can't really easily distinguish between viral infections and bacterial infections. But to some degree they can. And I want to contrast what we're doing in the United States with Sweden, where they have just as good health care and maybe people live even longer. In the U. S. the average child is getting about four courses of antibiotics by the time they're three. That's across the entire United States. Some kids are more, some kids are less. In Sweden, instead of four courses, it's 1. 4 courses. And by the age of 10 in the U. S. , the average child has gotten between 10 and 11 courses, and in Sweden it's about four courses. So at every age they're using fewer antibiotics. And Swedes are not that biologically different from us, but the practice of medicine is different, and culturally it's different. And here in the U. S. we know that we're overusing antibiotics, but every parent with their screaming child and uncomfortable child isn't willing to bite the bullet because they think that maybe the antibiotics could help them. But if. . . GROSS: Understandably, I might say, you know. BLASER: Yes, understandably, but if the antibiotics have cost, if every time you took an antibiotic perhaps it raised the risk in a child that they would get obesity or asthma or diabetes by one percent, and the risk is cumulative - and I'm just making up these numbers just to give an example - then maybe the mom would say, well, in that case maybe I should just wait a day or two and see if the baby's going to get well. And of course in most cases the baby does get well. So we've been giving antibiotics based on benefit without thinking that there might be long-term costs. And if there are costs, then the whole equation changes. GROSS: Dr. Martin Blaser will be back in the second half of the show. His new book is called \"Missing Microbes. \" I'm Terry Gross and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross back with Dr. Martin Blaser, author of the new book \"Missing Microbes: How the Overuse of Antibiotics is Fueling Our Modern Plagues. \" Blaser speculates that the rise in chronic conditions like obesity, asthma, Crohn's disease, eczema and juvenile diabetes is connected to changes in the human microbiome, the collection of microorganisms that live in and on our bodies. Most of the bacteria in the human microbiome - including bacteria essential to digestion and immunity - live in the gut, where they're vulnerable to antibiotics. Blaser directs the Human Microbiome Program at NYU. You're also asking if changes in the human microbiome might be contributing to the rise in allergies, like food allergies. BLASER: Yes. Yes. Well, so the question is: Why does someone become allergic to a food? And why has the rate of food allergies increased so dramatically? Peanut allergies, when I was growing up, were very rare. Now they're pretty common. And even if you say that there's some over-diagnosis, still at their nubbin, these have increased tremendously. So why should someone become sensitized to the food they eat? It all has to do with the formation of the immune system, how the immune system to differentiates between self and non-self. And what's training the immune system is the early life microbiome that is setting the context under which immune development occurs. GROSS: Explain that a little more for me, like how the bacteria and other microorganisms in my gut are out of balance, that that might lead to a food allergy. BLASER: Well, part of what I'm going to say is speculation, because I don't know the exact mechanisms. But what I can tell you is our own immune system is quite complex. There are many kinds of immune cells. There are cells that strongly recognized foreign substances. There are ones that try to damp it down and down-regulate it. There's what we call innate immunity, which is the immunity we're all born with. And then there's adaptive immunity, the immunity that develops when we experience different kinds of exposures. So it's very complex. It's developing early in life. And that's what sets, in essence, immunological tone that will determine how allergic a person is, or how, let's say, stoical a person is in an immunologic sense. That's the idea. GROSS: Part of your concern in general is the, you know, the overuse of antibiotics. And as you point out in the book, sometimes it's hard to tell. It's hard for a doctor to tell whether an infection is caused by a virus or bacteria. So I'm going to use myself as an example right now. I have a cold. My colds sometimes end in laryngitis. And my past history shows that sometimes - not always, but sometimes - like if I'm running a low-grade fever and I have a cold and I'm losing my voice, an antibiotic is really going to be helpful. But maybe that's just coincidence. Who knows? But the doctors don't seem to have a definitive way of knowing, you know, if my cold or your cold or anyone's cold is bacterial or viral unless they do a test that, you know, most doctors I think don't do. I mean, I know they can - if you have the symptoms, they'll find out if you have strep throat or not, and strep is a bacteria. So that would be definitive. But I'm just wondering why - why isn't there like an easier test to determine, for instance, whether what I have is viral or bacterial? BLASER: Yeah. So, a wonderful, important question. . . GROSS: Especially for me now. (LAUGHTER)BLASER: Yeah, especially for you. But I want to first say that, as far as I know, you're not three years old. So there are two scenarios that are important. One is the infections of young children while they're developing, and the other is infection in adults, who are fully developed. And my biggest concern is about development. GROSS: Mm-hmm. BLASER: But now let's turn to you. GROSS: OK. BLASER: And that is that, actually, a lot of technology exists so that we could tell you what's the cause of your infection right now. But it's very expensive, and there's just no medical necessity or rationale for it, because in general, your cold is going to get better 95 times out of 100. And what you know is that when you take the antibiotic, the next day you feel better. But what you don't know is what would have happened if you didn't take the antibiotic. And in many - there have been studies of people with conditions like you, and in most cases, the antibiotic effect is zero or marginal. So, again, our custom is to treat with antibiotics. I want to bring up a point that might be of interest to you that bears on this question. And that is that last year, the CDC published a survey of antibiotic use in the United States. And what they found is that in 2010, there were 258 million courses of antibiotics prescribed. And in our country, that comes out to 833 courses per thousand population, or about five courses for every six people. And from talking to the investigators at the CDC, this seems stable over a period of years. So our use of antibiotics is enormous. What was particularly interesting to me was the regional differences in antibiotic use. In the North and in the Midwest, it was about at the national average. In the West, it was way lower than the national average. It was about 630. And in the South, it was way higher. It was about 930. So between the West and the South, there was about a 50 percent difference in the prescribing of antibiotics. And I can tell you, as a specialist in infectious diseases, there is not a 50 percent difference in the rate of serious bacterial infections. So this difference in usage is a difference in culture and practice and expectations. And I think that's part of what we're up against. GROSS: So can you explain why it's so expensive to determine whether my cold is caused by a bacteria or a virus, or whether babies ear infection is caused by a bacteria or a virus? Considering the strides that we've made in medicine, it seems like that shouldn't be that big a deal. You know, you culture it. You look under the microscope and you see which it is. But apparently, it's not that simple. BLASER: Well, the technology is there, it just hasn't been employed because it's never been a necessity. If you give every child - when a child comes in with some kind of upper respiratory infection, the chance that they'll walk out of the doctor's office with an antibiotic is 70 to 80 percent, and that's improved over what it used to be. So there's no economic necessity driving it, and so we haven't really employed the technologies that we have available and produce them on a mass level and try to get economies of scale. But I think we should. I think we need - we've been living under this antibiotic umbrella, which has many very positive effects. But I'm concerned about the hidden long-term effects. And once we start to accurately count them, then we're going to have to start cutting back on antibiotic use, and therefore, we're going to have to develop much better diagnostics and we're going to have to use those diagnostics. And I think we're going to - the main thrust of antibiotic research in the last 50 years has been making broad spectrum antibiotics. So if somebody - if a child comes in with an ear infection, you can treat him with a certain antibiotic, and you know that it will cover all the important bacteria. But I think we should have diagnostics that will say, first, is it viral or bacterial? And if it's bacterial, which bacteria is it? And then the doctor can pull that agent off the shelf and say, OK, I'm with you treat your MafA(ph) infection just with a MafA-specific antibiotic so it won't do any collateral damage. We don't have those agents yet, but it wouldn't be that hard to develop them. The major issue right now is cost. GROSS: If you're joining us, my guest is Dr. Martin Blaser, and he is an expert in the role of bacteria and human disease. He's the director of the Human Microbiome Program at NYU, the former president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America and author of the new book \"Missing Microbes. \" And the book is about the human microbiome, and that is the collection of microorganisms, bacteria, viruses that live on or inside the body. Let's take a short break, then we'll talk some more. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're joining us, my guest is Dr. Martin Blaser, and he studies the role of bacteria and human disease. His new book is about the human microbiome, and it's called \"Missing Microbes. \" And the microbiome is the collection of bacteria, viruses and other microorganisms that live on or in the body. So, Dr. Blaser, I have a cold right now, and I have been trying to use the antibacterial cleanser on my hands so I don't infect the people I work with. You're going to advise me not to do that? (LAUGHTER)BLASER: Yeah. You know, I don't know the specifics of your case, and that may not be a bad idea. It's a little hard for me to judge. But people who are perfectly healthy are using these antibacterial materials every day, and by the million. And we just don't know the consequences. Maybe the consequences are trivial. Maybe there are no consequences. But we're doing it on such a scale. We should know. And my concern is that all the things we're doing are cumulative. We can't just look at them in isolation, but that kids are born by C-section. Moms get antibiotics during pregnancy. Kids are born by C-section. Kids are getting antibiotics when they're young. When they're older, they're in an antibacterial environment. My concern is that we are changing normal human development, development of our microbiome that has been going on since time immemorial. And in particular, we've been studying an organism that lives in the stomach called Helicobacter pylori - which we call HP just for short - which, as far as we know, has been present in humans since before we were humans, and over the course of the 20th century, it's almost completely disappeared. GROSS: It's disappeared? Well, what is it, first of all? BLASER: Helicobacter pylori is a bacteria that lives in the human stomach. And it's well known, because in the 1970s, two scientists in Australia found it in the stomach, and they tied the presence of this organism to ulcers. And they showed that if you treat people who have ulcers, to get rid of this bacteria, you can cure the ulcers. That was a huge breakthrough, and in fact, they won the Nobel Prize for their finding of the bacteria and its relationship to ulcers. And so, ever since then, we've been thinking about this organism as a bad organism, as a pathogen, and many doctors are trying to eliminate it from everybody. But, in fact, the bacteria has been disappearing over the course most of the 20th century, and we know this from a variety of different sources, even before the introduction of antibiotics. But antibiotics are certainly making it worse. And as the organism is disappearing, ulcer disease is going down, stomach cancer is going down. That's all very good news. But other diseases are going up, like diseases of the esophagus, one disease that's called reflux or GERD, reflux esophagitis. And then there's a cancer of the esophagus, which is the fastest increasing cancer in the United States and other developed countries. So the loss of Helicobacter appears to be very good for the stomach, but it also appears that it's bad for the esophagus. So we can't have - at this point, we can't have it both ways. And there's evidence that the loss of Helicobacter may be fueling the rise in childhood onset asthma, as well, both from epidemiologic studies that we've conducted and others, and also from experimental studies in mice that show the same thing. GROSS: What about the spread of MRSA, Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus? It's a resistant strain of bacteria that often lives in hospitals and other, you know, like nursing homes and medical institutions, C. difficile, which is also an increasingly resistant strain of bacteria that people often catch in hospitals and other health institutions, and it causes severe gastrointestinal upset that, in some cases, can even lead to death. What are your concerns about those resistant forms? BLASER: Yeah. Yeah. So, I have a lot of concerns about them. I'm not the only one. The director of the CDC has issued a big report about this. The more you use antibiotics, the more likely you are to select for resistant organisms. MRSA is a staph aureus that is resistant to the common organisms. Clostridium difficile, or C. diff, is an organism that is resistant to many of the antibiotics that we use. When they were first observed, they were found in the hospital, and which is not surprising, because that's where the greatest use of antibiotics are. But both of these infections have escaped the confines of the hospital. We're finding infections in people in the community who've never been to a hospital. They've lost their natural boundaries. So, you know, one of the questions is: why are they increasing so much? And part of it is all the antibiotics we're using that's selecting for them. But another possibility is that we're missing some of our Coast Guard, some of the organisms that help defend against them, and that's why they're spreading beyond their natural boundaries. And these are two well-described examples, and I'm afraid of future examples, and especially ones that might be antibiotic resistant, so that when we need the antibiotics, they won't even be working, because there's so much resistance. The overuse of antibiotics has two very bad effects. One is that we're promoting resistance. The more we use, the more we're selecting for a resistant organism. We've seen this again and again, and this is not controversial. And, of course, the other is that we are depleting our normal organisms, which are part of our defense against invaders. GROSS: So, this raises the question, you know, like we're so concerned about extinct animals, and even extinct insects in the environment causing imbalances in the, you know, ecological structure. Are you concerned, too, about extinction of bacteria in the human microbiome? BLASER: I'm very concerned about extinction of bacteria in the human microbiome. I think this is a really critical issue. It's the microbiological equivalent of global warming, and that is that we are changing our microecology through practice, and that, I believe, is fueling the risk of these modern plagues, these epidemic diseases. And I'm also afraid of something, which I've - in the book I've called antibiotic winter. That's a really very bleak scenario based on the knowledge that our normal organisms are protecting us against invaders. So if we've depleted our normal organisms, which there's more and more evidence is correct, and we're living in a smaller world where we're one or two days away from any village in the world, we are much more prone to epidemics and potentially very bad epidemics. And without our normal resistance, without our coast guard to help guard our shores, and in this case our coast guard are our bacteria, that's in addition to all the chronic disease fears that I have, I'm also quite worried about, you know, a worldwide pandemic fueled by our lack of biodiversity. We've seen it in cornfields. We've seen it in vineyards. We humans are not immune to that. GROSS: You know, for animals who are endangered, there are animal refuges, and there are, you know, there are movements to protect endangered species and so on. Is there anything comparable going on with the microbiome, with bacteria that might be endangered? BLASER: Yeah, so as you point out, we think that there are endangered bacterial species, that we have - that we people in the U. S. have much lower diversity than people who have not had the benefits of modern life. So my wife Maria Gloria Dominguez and myself and other investigators have been gradually studying peoples who have not been developed, people in the Amazon, people in the rainforest, people in different parts of Africa. And we're obtaining specimens from these people to study them, and that's how we know that we have lost a lot of diversity in relation to them, but also to archive the organisms that they have so that perhaps we can use these as the way to reseed our human populations. And these people, of course, inevitably will modernize as well, and it will help reseed them as well. So we're trying to create an archive, a stockpile of these disappeared organisms, that is before it's too late. GROSS: A lot of people now are taking probiotics, and probiotics are, you know, capsules or pills or liquids that have good guy bacteria in them, and the goal is to keep a healthy microbiome in the gut through the use of these probiotics, which is the opposite of antibiotics. Antibiotics kill bacteria. Probiotics are supposed to propagate good guy bacteria. How effective do you think they are? BLASER: Well, of course there many different probiotics. If you go to the grocery store, the health food store or the drugstore, there are shelves and shelves full of probiotics; different names, different compositions. I think I could say three things. The first is that they're almost completely unregulated. Second, is that they seem to be generally safe. And third is that they're mostly untested about the important reasons even want to take probiotics, because they don't feel well, or they have particular symptoms. There have been just a paucity of well-conducted studies of these. So right now it's the Wild West. I'm actually a big believer in probiotics. I think that's going to be part of the future of medicine, that we're going to understand the science of the microbiome well enough so that we can look at a sample from a child and say this child is lacking such-and-such an organism, and now we're going to take it off the shelf and we're going to give it back to that child. I can imagine that there will be certain organisms that we'll give to most children. Just as today the kids are lining up for the vaccines, in the future, maybe the kids are going to be drinking certain organisms so that we can replace the ones that they've lost. Those will be the real probiotics. GROSS: Well, let me ask you about something else, and that's fecal transplants, which we've been hearing more about lately, and that's the idea that if you want to create a more balanced microbiome in the gut of somebody who is totally out of balance and has gotten severely sick as a result, that you can take fecal matter from somebody with a healthy microbiome, transplant it into the person who's unhealthy, and the good-guy bacteria will start to take root. Thoughts? BLASER: I'm really glad you brought this up. So as we discuss, there's this terrible infection caused by an organism that we call C. diff. It's also - the infection is also called antibiotic-associated colitis. What happens is that somebody takes antibiotics, and then this invader comes in, and it takes over, and in some cases you can remove it with antibiotics, but in other cases you can't, and it persists, and it persists, it relapses, and some people die from it. It can be a very severe infection. And when we've studied the guts of such people, their intestinal microbiome is very disordered. And so doctors have found that if they can give the fecal materials from a normal person, they can cure these people from C. diff. So it's a very important proof of principle. It shows that if you have a very disordered microbiome, by bringing in a normal microbiome, you can cure them. Now this is a very extreme condition, and it's very kind of circumscribed and well-defined, but it's a proof of principle that in other cases of disordered microbiome, we'll be able to introduce either fecal material or specific organisms. We would call those specific organisms probiotics. Those are the probiotics I'm talking about. GROSS: My guest is Dr. Martin Blaser. His new book is called \"Missing Microbes. \" More after a break; this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. My guest is Dr. Martin Blaser. His new book, \"Missing Microbes,\" is about how the overuse of antibiotics may be contributing to the rise of conditions like food allergies, asthma, obesity, Crohn's disease and eczema. He's an expert on the human microbiome, the collection of bacteria and other microorganisms that live in and on the human body but mostly in the gut. So you've been very cautionary about the problems, long-term and short-term, individual and societal, that are being caused by the overuse of antibiotics and antibacterials. What are the two or three things you'd like us to do as individuals or as a culture to reverse that trend? BLASER: Yeah, I mean, there's a whole list of things that we should do. Number one on the list is that we have to stop the overuse of antibiotics. We have to slow this down and try to use antibiotics more judiciously for when people really need them and not for convenience or for very marginal benefit. And it's clear that much of antibiotic use is for very marginal benefit. And it's also clear that we could cut down on our antibiotic use dramatically and have no ill effects of health. But that means we have to take more time, perhaps we have to pay doctors so instead of seeing patients every eight minutes, they'd see patients every 15 minutes so they could have a little more time to think and to explain and to examine. I think we need to develop narrow-spectrum antibiotics, not just broad-spectrum antibiotics, but really focused antibiotics. I think that the parent of the future, if you said, you know, we can give you broad-spectrum antibiotics, but it's going to cause a lot of collateral damage to our child's microbiome, or we can give you a narrow-spectrum one, it may cost you a little more, most parents will say I'll take the narrow-spectrum one if you know what the organism is. So we're going to need to develop better diagnostics so we know exactly what it is. A lot of this technology is available, but it's not cost-effective. So we have to change the economics of health care for children in this country. GROSS: When was the last time you took antibiotics? BLASER: The last time I took antibiotics was about two years ago. I was in the Amazon, and I was in an area where there was a lot of malaria. And the prudent thing was to take antibiotics, and actually I only took it for part of the time because I have mixed feelings about antibiotics. GROSS: Well, clearly you have mixed feelings about antibiotics. But I want to make sure we're leaving with the right message, which is that sometimes you really need antibiotics. You know, the goal is not to take them when you don't need them, but, like, take them when you need them, right? BLASER: Yeah, well, so absolutely. When somebody's sick, there is nothing better than antibiotics. And actually in my book, I talk about when I got very sick after coming back from India, and I couldn't wait for the antibiotics because I was so sick. But it's not - the decision to take antibiotics isn't a person's decision. It should be the decision of their doctor, their health care provider. They should make the decision who should take the antibiotic or not. And I'm speaking to doctors to talk to them about the cost of antibiotic overuse, as well, so that we can - by more careful evaluation, we could cut down on a lot of antibiotic use because the benefits are marginal. I'm not saying that people who are really sick shouldn't take antibiotics. In fact they must take antibiotics. But most of the cases are in that very gray area. GROSS: Well, Dr. Martin Blaser, thank you. BLASER: And thank you for having me on your show. GROSS: Dr. Martin Blaser is the author of \"Missing Microbes: How the Overuse of Antibiotics is Fueling Our Modern Plagues. \" You can read the first chapter on our website, freshair. npr. org. I'm Terry Gross. TERRY GROSS, HOST:  This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. There's a lot of theories about why food allergies, asthma, celiac disease and intestinal disorders like Crohn's disease have been on the rise. My guest, Dr. Martin Blaser, speculates that it may be connected to the overuse of antibiotics, which has resulted in killing off strains of bacteria that typically live in the gut. Blaser is an expert on the human microbe biome, which is the collection of bacteria, viruses, fungi and other microbes that live in and on the body. In fact, about 70 to 90 percent of all the cells in the human body aren't human at all; they're microorganisms. Blaser is the director of the Human Microbiome Program and former chair of medicine at NYU. And he's the former president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America. His new book is called \"Missing Microbes: How the Overuse of Antibiotics is Fueling Our Modern Plagues. \" He says that with the overuse of antibiotics, as well as some other now-common practices like Caesarian sections - he'll explain the connection a little later - we've entered a danger zone, a no man's land between the world of our ancient microbiome and an uncharted modern world. Dr. Martin Blaser, welcome to FRESH AIR. So when there are imbalances in the microbiome, things can go wrong, and you say that scientists now are beginning to think that some of what's often described as the modern plagues of medicine today, that some of those might be caused by imbalances of these microbes. So what are the, quote, \"modern plagues\" that you're talking about? MARTIN BLASER: Yeah, and that's a good place to start. Since World War II we've seen big rises in a number of diseases: asthma, allergies, food allergies, wheat allergy, juvenile diabetes, obesity, autism. These are all diseases that have gone up dramatically in the last 50 or 70 years. And one of the questions is: Why are they going up? Are they going up for 10 different reasons? Or perhaps there's one reason that's fueling all of them. GROSS: And your theory is that one reason might be the microbiome? BLASER: My theory is that the one reason is the changing microbiome, that we evolved a certain stable situation with our microbiome, and with the modern advances of modern life, including modern medical practices, we have been disrupting the microbiome, and there's evidence for that, especially early in life, and it's changing how our children develop. That's my big theory. That's what I expound in the book. GROSS: Well, I will say that people who are involved in environmental issues think that it's, you know, toxins in the environment that are causing a lot of these, you know, quote, modern plagues; and people who deal with food and nutrition issues think that it's, like, you know, bad nutrition and, you know, fatty foods and fast food, empty calories that's causing a lot of today's modern plagues. And your specialty is the human microbiome, and you think it's that. So you know, I just wanted to point that out to everybody; everybody thinks it's from their field, yeah. BLASER: I don't discount those, and in fact nothing says that causation has to be exclusive. GROSS: Right. BLASER: Causation could be additive. And in fact we have experiments in mice where, since we were very interested in obesity, if we put mice on a high-fat diet, they gain weight, they get fat. If we put them on antibiotics early in life, they also get fat. And if we put them on both together, they get very fat. And we've done this in male mice. We've done this in female mice. It's clear that the effects of the antibiotics potentiate the effects of the high-fat diet. So it's not - we're not letting high-fat diet off the hook. We're saying there's another factor there. GROSS: Well, that's really interesting, and why would antibiotics contribute to obesity? BLASER: Yeah, well, I'm very glad you asked that question. We've been interested in this for more than 10 years, and it began with the - all of a sudden the light bulb went off. We know that farmers have been feeding antibiotics to their farm animals, to their livestock for almost 70 years. And the reason they do that is that it promotes their growth. They grow bigger faster. They use their food more efficiently to convert food calories into body mass. And one day I thought, well, if farmers are using antibiotics to promote the growth in their livestock, is it possible that the antibiotics we're using in children are doing the same thing? And that's why we began to do studies in mice. GROSS: Now, I thought the antibiotics in farm animals were being used to prevent them from getting sick because they're - in factory farming the animals are so close together, it's a very unhealthy situation, and it's easy to get sick, and then it's easy for disease to spread. BLASER: Yes, that's true that it is - that just as you say, because they're close together, there's a lot of contagion. But the reason that the farmers are using the antibiotics is to promote growth. And again, there's a literature going back to the 1940s that shows that the use of sub-therapeutic antibiotics, these aren't therapeutic levels, these are sub-therapeutic levels, they're efficient at increasing growth. And in reality the farmers and the farm scientists figured out a lot of this stuff years ago, and in one sense we're rediscovering it because the question is: Why should it work? Why does that work? And then it brings us back to the microbiome and the idea that there's a choreography, there's a normal developmental cycle of the microbiome from birth over the first few years of life. Especially the first three years appear to be the most important. And that's how nature has - how we have evolved together so that we can maximize health and create a new generation, which is nature's great purpose. And because of modern practices we have disrupted that, and then the question is: Does that have consequence? And our studies in mice show that it does have consequences. We've done epidemiologic studies in people that show that some of these modern practices are increasing the risk of obesity as well. GROSS: You mentioned that the microbiome is developed during the first three years of life. And there's something you write about in the book that just, I hadn't heard this before, I found it so interesting, that when the baby passes through the birth canal that it develops some of its microbiome. I want you explain that. BLASER: So as far as we know, when the baby is inside the womb, it is apparently sterile. There are some people who actually question this, too, but the big moment of truth is when the membranes rupture, the water breaks, and the baby starts coming out. And that's where they first get exposed to the bacteria of the world. And the first bacteria they are exposed to is their mother's bacteria in the birth canal. So as labor proceeds, the babies are in contact with the microbes lining their mother's vagina, and as they're going out, they're covered by these bacteria. They swallow the bacteria; it's on their skin. There are a soup of these bacteria. That's their initial exposure to the world of bacteria. GROSS: And you're saying that's a good thing, that's an important thing. BLASER: Well, that's how mammals have been doing it for the last 150 million years, whether they're dolphins or elephants or humans. And that's how it's been done, and we know a little bit about what those bacteria are. The most common bacteria are lactobacillus. And there's evidence that over the course of pregnancy, the microbiome in the vagina changes, just as many other parts of the body are changing, the microbiome is changing in its composition in terms of maximizing lactobacilli. And these are bacteria that eat lactose, which is the main component of milk. So the baby's mouth is filled with lactobacilli. The first thing that happens is they go up against their mom's breast and they inoculate the nipple with lactobacilli, and now milk and lactobacilli go into the new baby, and that's the foundation for their microbiome, and that's how they start their life. GROSS: And what - does the lactobacilli have a protective function? BLASER: People have been studying lactobacilli and bifidobacteria, that's another class or organisms the baby gets from their mothers. But there's been a lot of study for many years showing many different beneficial effects, and these are the foundation of the microbiome that then gets later built on as babies experience more and more organisms. And so you could project that if they didn't acquire these organisms, or if they didn't acquire them normally or at the normal time, then the foundations might be a little shaky, and that's exactly what - one of the points that I've proposed. GROSS: So you're proposing that Caesarian births might compromise the microbiome of the baby? BLASER: Well, actually, a very important study was done by Maria Gloria Dominguez and Rob Knight, and I think it's particularly important because Gloria is my wife. She did a study of moms who had C-sections or moms who gave birth vaginally, and shortly after birth, they compared the microbiomes in the babies that came out. And the babies that were born vaginally, their microbiome, not surprisingly, looked like the mom's vagina everywhere in the body - in their GI tract, on their skin, in their mouth. But the babies born by C-section, their microbiome looked like skin, and it didn't even necessarily look like the mom's skin. Maybe it was somebody else in the operating room. So it's clear that the microbiome is different immediately depending on the kind of birth. GROSS: So it's different, but we don't know for sure what that difference means? BLASER: We don't know what that means, but there have been more and more epidemiologic studies asking the question really for the first time: Are there long-term health consequences of being born by C-section? We did a study in England, a cohort of more than 10,000 children was enrolled in the early 1990s in which the investigators followed these kids for a number of years, took lots of measurements, and we asked the question, was there a different in how - their rate of getting fat or getting obese when they were three, seven, 15, whether they were born by C-section or vaginally. And our studies showed that kids born by C-section were more likely to have increased fat than the other kids. And this is one of four studies that has appeared in the last two years showing exactly the same thing: in Boston; our study in England; a study in Canada; a study in Brazil, all showing the same thing. GROSS: So you mention a very do-it-yourself kind of compensatory procedure of using cotton gauze. Would you explain that? BLASER: Well, this was actually - this was my wife Gloria's idea, and that is that if babies born by C-section are deprived of the natural microbiota that they would have gotten through birth canal delivery, why shouldn't we restore that? And so she's done - she's conducting an experiment, it's been approved by the Institutional Review Board, in which she has three groups of mothers: vaginal birth; C-section birth; and then C-section with a swab in the vagina. Now when the baby is born, the baby gets swabbed with this cotton swab with vaginal content so as to restore that which has been missed by the C-section. GROSS: It's too soon to see what the results are, right? BLASER: She's just analyzing the data now, and she's going to present this work at a big national meeting next month. GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is Dr. Martin Blaser, and he studies the role of bacteria in human disease. He's the director of the Human Microbiome Program at NYU and the author of the new book \"Missing Microbes,\" which is about the human microbiome and the microbiome is the collection of microorganisms - bacteria, fungi, viruses and other microorganisms - in our body, some of which are very helpful, some of them not so much. Let's take a short break, and then we'll talk some more. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GROSS: This is FRESH AIR, and if you're just joining us, my guest is Dr. Martin Blaser, and we're talking about the human microbiome, and that's the collection of microorganisms - bacteria, viruses, fungi and other microorganisms - that live in the body and perform a lot of functions in the body and sometimes get invaded by not-so-good microorganisms. His new book is called \"Missing Microbes,\" and he's the director of the Human Microbiome Program at NYU and the former president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America. You're concerned that women who are delivering a baby are often prescribed antibiotics. I assume that's to prevent infection, which can be, you know, deadly. What's your concern? BLASER: Well, I have to go back a couple steps and go back to the beginning of the age of antibiotics, when people were dying of very awful infections and antibiotics were miraculous. I mean they were one of the great miracles of the 20th century, and my specialty is infectious diseases. That's - we love antibiotics. But because they were so miraculous, people said, well, let's just start using them for this, and let's use them for that. And everybody thought if there's even a tiny bit of benefit, it's worthwhile using them, because no one thought that there was any biological cost to antibiotics. There might be some short-term effects, people thought. We knew that people got an upset stomach, or maybe they'd get a skin rash, but then when you stopped the antibiotics, everybody assumed that everything would just bounce back for normal. But in fact there was essentially no data that that was correct, and we now have more and more data that it is not correct, that things do not bounce back to normal, and in fact why should they, because an antibiotic is a powerful agent that its job is to inhibit or kill bacteria. So the antibiotic changes the composition that's present in the body, and some of the organisms will go down. Others will go up in compensation. And some of  them will go down to zero. And when they go to zero, they don't come back. They're extinct. GROSS: So relate that to giving a woman in childbirth or just after childbirth antibiotics. BLASER: So there's a very serious infection of children called infection by Group B Strep. It's an important infection of newborns. And it was found that if you give - if women have Group B Strep in the vagina, or they're carrying it in their vagina or their gastrointestinal tract, if you give them penicillin just before the moment of birth, you can pretty much prevent Group B Strep infection. So that was considered to be a great breakthrough. One of the problems is that to prevent any single case of Group B Strep infection, we have to treat about 200 mothers, and thus their 200 children as well. And so the question is, if there was even a little biological cost in those 200 women, it's possible that that could outweigh some of or all of the benefit of - in that one child in which it's prevented. So everybody was looking at the benefit of the antibiotic but not really calculating the cost. And once you assume that there might be a cost, then you can begin to more accurately decide should we do this procedure or not, or should we improve our diagnostics, so instead of treating one in 200, maybe we should only treat one in 10. GROSS: So are you concerned that if a baby is born without a kind of full and varied microbiome, either because of antibiotics or because it was a Caesarian birth, and again a lot of this is still very speculative, that if they're born without that full, varied microbiome, that they will never be able to develop it? BLASER: What we know about development is that there are developmental windows that you have to go through, various stages, that it's not random. And there are just times. We know that for the - how tall kids become, for example, and we know that about their development of intelligence. And so I'm concerned that the microbiome is part of our whole developmental process, and if we disrupt it early, there are potentially consequences. These are difficult to study in humans. You can study them through big epidemiologic studies, such as I described, or you can study them in experimental animals. And that's why we do a lot of work with mice. GROSS: So you were describing your concern that if a woman during childbirth or an infant is given antibiotics, that might affect the baby's microbiome, and who knows how long that would last, the effects of that would last, maybe a short time, maybe forever, we don't really know yet. But you're concerned about the imbalance it would create. A lot of children get ear infections, and as a result of the ear infections they get antibiotics. And for some children it's recurrent ear infections, which means more doses of antibiotics. What are your concerns about the ear infections and the antibiotics? BLASER: So that's a very important issue because as you point out, ear infections are very common in children, and in the United States we're giving a very high percentage of these kids antibiotics every time they have an ear infection. And that's not the only way to practice medicine. First, we know that most of those ear infections are not caused by bacteria at all; they're caused by viruses. And antibiotics don't work against viral infections. That's very clear. So one of the problems is that the doctor can't really easily distinguish between viral infections and bacterial infections. But to some degree they can. And I want to contrast what we're doing in the United States with Sweden, where they have just as good health care and maybe people live even longer. In the U. S. the average child is getting about four courses of antibiotics by the time they're three. That's across the entire United States. Some kids are more, some kids are less. In Sweden, instead of four courses, it's 1. 4 courses. And by the age of 10 in the U. S. , the average child has gotten between 10 and 11 courses, and in Sweden it's about four courses. So at every age they're using fewer antibiotics. And Swedes are not that biologically different from us, but the practice of medicine is different, and culturally it's different. And here in the U. S. we know that we're overusing antibiotics, but every parent with their screaming child and uncomfortable child isn't willing to bite the bullet because they think that maybe the antibiotics could help them. But if. . . GROSS: Understandably, I might say, you know. BLASER: Yes, understandably, but if the antibiotics have cost, if every time you took an antibiotic perhaps it raised the risk in a child that they would get obesity or asthma or diabetes by one percent, and the risk is cumulative - and I'm just making up these numbers just to give an example - then maybe the mom would say, well, in that case maybe I should just wait a day or two and see if the baby's going to get well. And of course in most cases the baby does get well. So we've been giving antibiotics based on benefit without thinking that there might be long-term costs. And if there are costs, then the whole equation changes. GROSS: Dr. Martin Blaser will be back in the second half of the show. His new book is called \"Missing Microbes. \" I'm Terry Gross and this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross back with Dr. Martin Blaser, author of the new book \"Missing Microbes: How the Overuse of Antibiotics is Fueling Our Modern Plagues. \" Blaser speculates that the rise in chronic conditions like obesity, asthma, Crohn's disease, eczema and juvenile diabetes is connected to changes in the human microbiome, the collection of microorganisms that live in and on our bodies. Most of the bacteria in the human microbiome - including bacteria essential to digestion and immunity - live in the gut, where they're vulnerable to antibiotics. Blaser directs the Human Microbiome Program at NYU. You're also asking if changes in the human microbiome might be contributing to the rise in allergies, like food allergies. BLASER: Yes. Yes. Well, so the question is: Why does someone become allergic to a food? And why has the rate of food allergies increased so dramatically? Peanut allergies, when I was growing up, were very rare. Now they're pretty common. And even if you say that there's some over-diagnosis, still at their nubbin, these have increased tremendously. So why should someone become sensitized to the food they eat? It all has to do with the formation of the immune system, how the immune system to differentiates between self and non-self. And what's training the immune system is the early life microbiome that is setting the context under which immune development occurs. GROSS: Explain that a little more for me, like how the bacteria and other microorganisms in my gut are out of balance, that that might lead to a food allergy. BLASER: Well, part of what I'm going to say is speculation, because I don't know the exact mechanisms. But what I can tell you is our own immune system is quite complex. There are many kinds of immune cells. There are cells that strongly recognized foreign substances. There are ones that try to damp it down and down-regulate it. There's what we call innate immunity, which is the immunity we're all born with. And then there's adaptive immunity, the immunity that develops when we experience different kinds of exposures. So it's very complex. It's developing early in life. And that's what sets, in essence, immunological tone that will determine how allergic a person is, or how, let's say, stoical a person is in an immunologic sense. That's the idea. GROSS: Part of your concern in general is the, you know, the overuse of antibiotics. And as you point out in the book, sometimes it's hard to tell. It's hard for a doctor to tell whether an infection is caused by a virus or bacteria. So I'm going to use myself as an example right now. I have a cold. My colds sometimes end in laryngitis. And my past history shows that sometimes - not always, but sometimes - like if I'm running a low-grade fever and I have a cold and I'm losing my voice, an antibiotic is really going to be helpful. But maybe that's just coincidence. Who knows? But the doctors don't seem to have a definitive way of knowing, you know, if my cold or your cold or anyone's cold is bacterial or viral unless they do a test that, you know, most doctors I think don't do. I mean, I know they can - if you have the symptoms, they'll find out if you have strep throat or not, and strep is a bacteria. So that would be definitive. But I'm just wondering why - why isn't there like an easier test to determine, for instance, whether what I have is viral or bacterial? BLASER: Yeah. So, a wonderful, important question. . . GROSS: Especially for me now. (LAUGHTER) BLASER: Yeah, especially for you. But I want to first say that, as far as I know, you're not three years old. So there are two scenarios that are important. One is the infections of young children while they're developing, and the other is infection in adults, who are fully developed. And my biggest concern is about development. GROSS: Mm-hmm. BLASER: But now let's turn to you. GROSS: OK. BLASER: And that is that, actually, a lot of technology exists so that we could tell you what's the cause of your infection right now. But it's very expensive, and there's just no medical necessity or rationale for it, because in general, your cold is going to get better 95 times out of 100. And what you know is that when you take the antibiotic, the next day you feel better. But what you don't know is what would have happened if you didn't take the antibiotic. And in many - there have been studies of people with conditions like you, and in most cases, the antibiotic effect is zero or marginal. So, again, our custom is to treat with antibiotics. I want to bring up a point that might be of interest to you that bears on this question. And that is that last year, the CDC published a survey of antibiotic use in the United States. And what they found is that in 2010, there were 258 million courses of antibiotics prescribed. And in our country, that comes out to 833 courses per thousand population, or about five courses for every six people. And from talking to the investigators at the CDC, this seems stable over a period of years. So our use of antibiotics is enormous. What was particularly interesting to me was the regional differences in antibiotic use. In the North and in the Midwest, it was about at the national average. In the West, it was way lower than the national average. It was about 630. And in the South, it was way higher. It was about 930. So between the West and the South, there was about a 50 percent difference in the prescribing of antibiotics. And I can tell you, as a specialist in infectious diseases, there is not a 50 percent difference in the rate of serious bacterial infections. So this difference in usage is a difference in culture and practice and expectations. And I think that's part of what we're up against. GROSS: So can you explain why it's so expensive to determine whether my cold is caused by a bacteria or a virus, or whether babies ear infection is caused by a bacteria or a virus? Considering the strides that we've made in medicine, it seems like that shouldn't be that big a deal. You know, you culture it. You look under the microscope and you see which it is. But apparently, it's not that simple. BLASER: Well, the technology is there, it just hasn't been employed because it's never been a necessity. If you give every child - when a child comes in with some kind of upper respiratory infection, the chance that they'll walk out of the doctor's office with an antibiotic is 70 to 80 percent, and that's improved over what it used to be. So there's no economic necessity driving it, and so we haven't really employed the technologies that we have available and produce them on a mass level and try to get economies of scale. But I think we should. I think we need - we've been living under this antibiotic umbrella, which has many very positive effects. But I'm concerned about the hidden long-term effects. And once we start to accurately count them, then we're going to have to start cutting back on antibiotic use, and therefore, we're going to have to develop much better diagnostics and we're going to have to use those diagnostics. And I think we're going to - the main thrust of antibiotic research in the last 50 years has been making broad spectrum antibiotics. So if somebody - if a child comes in with an ear infection, you can treat him with a certain antibiotic, and you know that it will cover all the important bacteria. But I think we should have diagnostics that will say, first, is it viral or bacterial? And if it's bacterial, which bacteria is it? And then the doctor can pull that agent off the shelf and say, OK, I'm with you treat your MafA(ph) infection just with a MafA-specific antibiotic so it won't do any collateral damage. We don't have those agents yet, but it wouldn't be that hard to develop them. The major issue right now is cost. GROSS: If you're joining us, my guest is Dr. Martin Blaser, and he is an expert in the role of bacteria and human disease. He's the director of the Human Microbiome Program at NYU, the former president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America and author of the new book \"Missing Microbes. \" And the book is about the human microbiome, and that is the collection of microorganisms, bacteria, viruses that live on or inside the body. Let's take a short break, then we'll talk some more. This is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're joining us, my guest is Dr. Martin Blaser, and he studies the role of bacteria and human disease. His new book is about the human microbiome, and it's called \"Missing Microbes. \" And the microbiome is the collection of bacteria, viruses and other microorganisms that live on or in the body. So, Dr. Blaser, I have a cold right now, and I have been trying to use the antibacterial cleanser on my hands so I don't infect the people I work with. You're going to advise me not to do that? (LAUGHTER) BLASER: Yeah. You know, I don't know the specifics of your case, and that may not be a bad idea. It's a little hard for me to judge. But people who are perfectly healthy are using these antibacterial materials every day, and by the million. And we just don't know the consequences. Maybe the consequences are trivial. Maybe there are no consequences. But we're doing it on such a scale. We should know. And my concern is that all the things we're doing are cumulative. We can't just look at them in isolation, but that kids are born by C-section. Moms get antibiotics during pregnancy. Kids are born by C-section. Kids are getting antibiotics when they're young. When they're older, they're in an antibacterial environment. My concern is that we are changing normal human development, development of our microbiome that has been going on since time immemorial. And in particular, we've been studying an organism that lives in the stomach called Helicobacter pylori - which we call HP just for short - which, as far as we know, has been present in humans since before we were humans, and over the course of the 20th century, it's almost completely disappeared. GROSS: It's disappeared? Well, what is it, first of all? BLASER: Helicobacter pylori is a bacteria that lives in the human stomach. And it's well known, because in the 1970s, two scientists in Australia found it in the stomach, and they tied the presence of this organism to ulcers. And they showed that if you treat people who have ulcers, to get rid of this bacteria, you can cure the ulcers. That was a huge breakthrough, and in fact, they won the Nobel Prize for their finding of the bacteria and its relationship to ulcers. And so, ever since then, we've been thinking about this organism as a bad organism, as a pathogen, and many doctors are trying to eliminate it from everybody. But, in fact, the bacteria has been disappearing over the course most of the 20th century, and we know this from a variety of different sources, even before the introduction of antibiotics. But antibiotics are certainly making it worse. And as the organism is disappearing, ulcer disease is going down, stomach cancer is going down. That's all very good news. But other diseases are going up, like diseases of the esophagus, one disease that's called reflux or GERD, reflux esophagitis. And then there's a cancer of the esophagus, which is the fastest increasing cancer in the United States and other developed countries. So the loss of Helicobacter appears to be very good for the stomach, but it also appears that it's bad for the esophagus. So we can't have - at this point, we can't have it both ways. And there's evidence that the loss of Helicobacter may be fueling the rise in childhood onset asthma, as well, both from epidemiologic studies that we've conducted and others, and also from experimental studies in mice that show the same thing. GROSS: What about the spread of MRSA, Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus? It's a resistant strain of bacteria that often lives in hospitals and other, you know, like nursing homes and medical institutions, C. difficile, which is also an increasingly resistant strain of bacteria that people often catch in hospitals and other health institutions, and it causes severe gastrointestinal upset that, in some cases, can even lead to death. What are your concerns about those resistant forms? BLASER: Yeah. Yeah. So, I have a lot of concerns about them. I'm not the only one. The director of the CDC has issued a big report about this. The more you use antibiotics, the more likely you are to select for resistant organisms. MRSA is a staph aureus that is resistant to the common organisms. Clostridium difficile, or C. diff, is an organism that is resistant to many of the antibiotics that we use. When they were first observed, they were found in the hospital, and which is not surprising, because that's where the greatest use of antibiotics are. But both of these infections have escaped the confines of the hospital. We're finding infections in people in the community who've never been to a hospital. They've lost their natural boundaries. So, you know, one of the questions is: why are they increasing so much? And part of it is all the antibiotics we're using that's selecting for them. But another possibility is that we're missing some of our Coast Guard, some of the organisms that help defend against them, and that's why they're spreading beyond their natural boundaries. And these are two well-described examples, and I'm afraid of future examples, and especially ones that might be antibiotic resistant, so that when we need the antibiotics, they won't even be working, because there's so much resistance. The overuse of antibiotics has two very bad effects. One is that we're promoting resistance. The more we use, the more we're selecting for a resistant organism. We've seen this again and again, and this is not controversial. And, of course, the other is that we are depleting our normal organisms, which are part of our defense against invaders. GROSS: So, this raises the question, you know, like we're so concerned about extinct animals, and even extinct insects in the environment causing imbalances in the, you know, ecological structure. Are you concerned, too, about extinction of bacteria in the human microbiome? BLASER: I'm very concerned about extinction of bacteria in the human microbiome. I think this is a really critical issue. It's the microbiological equivalent of global warming, and that is that we are changing our microecology through practice, and that, I believe, is fueling the risk of these modern plagues, these epidemic diseases. And I'm also afraid of something, which I've - in the book I've called antibiotic winter. That's a really very bleak scenario based on the knowledge that our normal organisms are protecting us against invaders. So if we've depleted our normal organisms, which there's more and more evidence is correct, and we're living in a smaller world where we're one or two days away from any village in the world, we are much more prone to epidemics and potentially very bad epidemics. And without our normal resistance, without our coast guard to help guard our shores, and in this case our coast guard are our bacteria, that's in addition to all the chronic disease fears that I have, I'm also quite worried about, you know, a worldwide pandemic fueled by our lack of biodiversity. We've seen it in cornfields. We've seen it in vineyards. We humans are not immune to that. GROSS: You know, for animals who are endangered, there are animal refuges, and there are, you know, there are movements to protect endangered species and so on. Is there anything comparable going on with the microbiome, with bacteria that might be endangered? BLASER: Yeah, so as you point out, we think that there are endangered bacterial species, that we have - that we people in the U. S. have much lower diversity than people who have not had the benefits of modern life. So my wife Maria Gloria Dominguez and myself and other investigators have been gradually studying peoples who have not been developed, people in the Amazon, people in the rainforest, people in different parts of Africa. And we're obtaining specimens from these people to study them, and that's how we know that we have lost a lot of diversity in relation to them, but also to archive the organisms that they have so that perhaps we can use these as the way to reseed our human populations. And these people, of course, inevitably will modernize as well, and it will help reseed them as well. So we're trying to create an archive, a stockpile of these disappeared organisms, that is before it's too late. GROSS: A lot of people now are taking probiotics, and probiotics are, you know, capsules or pills or liquids that have good guy bacteria in them, and the goal is to keep a healthy microbiome in the gut through the use of these probiotics, which is the opposite of antibiotics. Antibiotics kill bacteria. Probiotics are supposed to propagate good guy bacteria. How effective do you think they are? BLASER: Well, of course there many different probiotics. If you go to the grocery store, the health food store or the drugstore, there are shelves and shelves full of probiotics; different names, different compositions. I think I could say three things. The first is that they're almost completely unregulated. Second, is that they seem to be generally safe. And third is that they're mostly untested about the important reasons even want to take probiotics, because they don't feel well, or they have particular symptoms. There have been just a paucity of well-conducted studies of these. So right now it's the Wild West. I'm actually a big believer in probiotics. I think that's going to be part of the future of medicine, that we're going to understand the science of the microbiome well enough so that we can look at a sample from a child and say this child is lacking such-and-such an organism, and now we're going to take it off the shelf and we're going to give it back to that child. I can imagine that there will be certain organisms that we'll give to most children. Just as today the kids are lining up for the vaccines, in the future, maybe the kids are going to be drinking certain organisms so that we can replace the ones that they've lost. Those will be the real probiotics. GROSS: Well, let me ask you about something else, and that's fecal transplants, which we've been hearing more about lately, and that's the idea that if you want to create a more balanced microbiome in the gut of somebody who is totally out of balance and has gotten severely sick as a result, that you can take fecal matter from somebody with a healthy microbiome, transplant it into the person who's unhealthy, and the good-guy bacteria will start to take root. Thoughts? BLASER: I'm really glad you brought this up. So as we discuss, there's this terrible infection caused by an organism that we call C. diff. It's also - the infection is also called antibiotic-associated colitis. What happens is that somebody takes antibiotics, and then this invader comes in, and it takes over, and in some cases you can remove it with antibiotics, but in other cases you can't, and it persists, and it persists, it relapses, and some people die from it. It can be a very severe infection. And when we've studied the guts of such people, their intestinal microbiome is very disordered. And so doctors have found that if they can give the fecal materials from a normal person, they can cure these people from C. diff. So it's a very important proof of principle. It shows that if you have a very disordered microbiome, by bringing in a normal microbiome, you can cure them. Now this is a very extreme condition, and it's very kind of circumscribed and well-defined, but it's a proof of principle that in other cases of disordered microbiome, we'll be able to introduce either fecal material or specific organisms. We would call those specific organisms probiotics. Those are the probiotics I'm talking about. GROSS: My guest is Dr. Martin Blaser. His new book is called \"Missing Microbes. \" More after a break; this is FRESH AIR. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. My guest is Dr. Martin Blaser. His new book, \"Missing Microbes,\" is about how the overuse of antibiotics may be contributing to the rise of conditions like food allergies, asthma, obesity, Crohn's disease and eczema. He's an expert on the human microbiome, the collection of bacteria and other microorganisms that live in and on the human body but mostly in the gut. So you've been very cautionary about the problems, long-term and short-term, individual and societal, that are being caused by the overuse of antibiotics and antibacterials. What are the two or three things you'd like us to do as individuals or as a culture to reverse that trend? BLASER: Yeah, I mean, there's a whole list of things that we should do. Number one on the list is that we have to stop the overuse of antibiotics. We have to slow this down and try to use antibiotics more judiciously for when people really need them and not for convenience or for very marginal benefit. And it's clear that much of antibiotic use is for very marginal benefit. And it's also clear that we could cut down on our antibiotic use dramatically and have no ill effects of health. But that means we have to take more time, perhaps we have to pay doctors so instead of seeing patients every eight minutes, they'd see patients every 15 minutes so they could have a little more time to think and to explain and to examine. I think we need to develop narrow-spectrum antibiotics, not just broad-spectrum antibiotics, but really focused antibiotics. I think that the parent of the future, if you said, you know, we can give you broad-spectrum antibiotics, but it's going to cause a lot of collateral damage to our child's microbiome, or we can give you a narrow-spectrum one, it may cost you a little more, most parents will say I'll take the narrow-spectrum one if you know what the organism is. So we're going to need to develop better diagnostics so we know exactly what it is. A lot of this technology is available, but it's not cost-effective. So we have to change the economics of health care for children in this country. GROSS: When was the last time you took antibiotics? BLASER: The last time I took antibiotics was about two years ago. I was in the Amazon, and I was in an area where there was a lot of malaria. And the prudent thing was to take antibiotics, and actually I only took it for part of the time because I have mixed feelings about antibiotics. GROSS: Well, clearly you have mixed feelings about antibiotics. But I want to make sure we're leaving with the right message, which is that sometimes you really need antibiotics. You know, the goal is not to take them when you don't need them, but, like, take them when you need them, right? BLASER: Yeah, well, so absolutely. When somebody's sick, there is nothing better than antibiotics. And actually in my book, I talk about when I got very sick after coming back from India, and I couldn't wait for the antibiotics because I was so sick. But it's not - the decision to take antibiotics isn't a person's decision. It should be the decision of their doctor, their health care provider. They should make the decision who should take the antibiotic or not. And I'm speaking to doctors to talk to them about the cost of antibiotic overuse, as well, so that we can - by more careful evaluation, we could cut down on a lot of antibiotic use because the benefits are marginal. I'm not saying that people who are really sick shouldn't take antibiotics. In fact they must take antibiotics. But most of the cases are in that very gray area. GROSS: Well, Dr. Martin Blaser, thank you. BLASER: And thank you for having me on your show.

C. are unpacking some rare and precious cargo. It is something the Smithsonian has never had before - a nearly complete skeleton of a Tyrannosaurus Rex. In the coming months, NPR's Christopher Joyce will check in occasionally as the tries to make this meat-eating giant the nation's most famous dinosaur. Here's his first story. CHRISTOPHER JOYCE, BYLINE: For decades, the Smithsonian has coveted a real skeleton of a T. Rex, a charismatic 40-foot-long beast that's not only deliciously frightening to contemplate but fascinating to scientists. How did such an animal grow so large? How fast did it run? Was it a predator or a scavenger? And now, courtesy of the Museum of the Rockies in Bozeman, Montana, they're getting one. SHELLEY MCKAMEY: This is MOR-555, which is the scientific name of the specimen. JOYCE: In Bozeman, museum director Shelley McKamey stands eye to eye with the ferocious looking skull in the glass case in the museum's dinosaur hall. The room is dark with the rust-colored skull bathed in a spotlight beamed from above. It is actually even bigger than I thought. It's really huge, and just the teeth are incredibly frightening. MCKAMEY: Quite large. We call them banana-size teeth. JOYCE: The skull is over four feet long, with a gaping maw that could bite a cow in half. It's actually a cast for display. A copy of the real skull that's in the museum's basement, along with the rest of the animal, about to be shipped off as a gift to the Smithsonian. Now, this is no run-of-the-mill gift. Commonly known as the Wankel T. Rex, after the Montana rancher who found it, it's one of the most complete T. Rex skeletons in the world - 80 percent of the animal's original bones are intact. So why give it up to the Smithsonian? MCKAMEY: The opportunity for this specimen to be probably the most visited, the most visited famous T. Rex in the world, you know, its deserves its chance in Washington. JOYCE: McKamey also points out that Montana is thick with dinosaur bones. Sixty-five million years ago, this place was practically crawling with T. Rexes. The museum already has another mostly complete T. Rex in its collection, called Tex Rex. (SOUNDBITE OF MACHINERY)JOYCE: Down in the basement at the Bozeman Museum, workers are packing the last parts of the Wankel T. Rex bones into wooden crates on a loading dock. Watching intently is a tall, brown-haired paleontologist who's the beneficiary of all this. Kirk Johnson, the new head of the Smithsonian's natural history museum. He's seeing the skeleton for the first time. Workers pull off the top of Box Number 15 to give Johnson a look. Inside, the dinosaur's arm bones are velcroed into a white plaster cradle. They look like an entree in a porcelain serving dish. KIRK JOHNSON: Wow, wow, wow. (LAUGHTER)JOYCE: This was the first complete T. rex arm ever found. For such a giant beast, it's laughably small. JOHNSON: I mean the amazing thing is, look at this. It's like my arm. My arm is the size of the Tyrannosaurus Rex arm. (SOUNDBITE OF MACHINERY)JOYCE: Museum staff re-seal the box and tape it up. There's another Smithsonian scientist here, their Curator of Dinosaurs. Matt Carrano has been waiting two years for this day. MATT CARRANO: It is little bit like Christmas early, you know. It's very rare that you get to get your hands on even part of a T. Rex, right, so there's almost a complete skeleton over there. JOYCE: The Wankel T. Rex will be the star of the Smithsonian's new, $48 million Dinosaur Hall now under construction. The museum draws seven million visitors a year. But Carrano says there's also lots of new science to learn from such a complete skeleton. CARRANO: You can do things like ask how old it was when it died, ask what kind of life it had before it grew up. JOYCE: And what on Earth those little arms were for. (SOUNDBITE OF ROLLING CRATES)JOYCE: The next day, workers roll the crates out to a Federal Express tractor-trailer. FedEx is giving this the white gloves treatment, the truck will even have escort vehicles on its four-day drive to Washington. After the boxes are loaded, a crowd gathers on the windy front lawn of the museum to say goodbye. There's a hot dog lunch and a guy in a dinosaur suit. And Kathy Wankel is there. She's the rancher who discovered the first bone in 1988. She didn't quite know what she had until she showed it to a paleontologist at the Bozeman Museum. KATHY WANKEL: He took one look in that box and his eyes got huge. He said: You better come with me. JOYCE: She's a little sad to see it go. (SOUNDBITE OF HORN)JOYCE: Finally, the truck pulls off. Behind the wheel is the husband and wife team of Tammy and John Brubaker. The truck has got a 10-foot painting of a lunging T. Rex on the back. (SOUNDBITE OF A MUSICAL HORN)JOYCE: With a cavalcade of cars behind it, the truck drives down Main Street, past the old Baxter Hotel and Wild Joe's Coffee House, then out to Interstate 90. With two Chase vehicles for security following behind, it could be the only T. Rex that's been chased out of town. Christopher Joyce, NPR News.

After the boxes are loaded, a crowd gathers on the windy front lawn of the museum to say goodbye. There's a hot dog lunch and a guy in a dinosaur suit. And Kathy Wankel is there. She's the rancher who discovered the first bone in 1988. She didn't quite know what she had until she showed it to a paleontologist at the Bozeman Museum. KATHY WANKEL: He took one look in that box and his eyes got huge. He said: You better come with me. JOYCE: She's a little sad to see it go. (SOUNDBITE OF HORN) JOYCE: Finally, the truck pulls off. Behind the wheel is the husband and wife team of Tammy and John Brubaker. The truck has got a 10-foot painting of a lunging T. Rex on the back. (SOUNDBITE OF A MUSICAL HORN) JOYCE: With a cavalcade of cars behind it, the truck drives down Main Street, past the old Baxter Hotel and Wild Joe's Coffee House, then out to Interstate 90. With two Chase vehicles for security following behind, it could be the only T. Rex that's been chased out of town. Christopher Joyce, NPR News.

I'm Arun Rath. There's been a big push lately to improve the teaching of science in American schools and focus more on STEM education. That stands for Science, Technology, Engineering and Math. WBEZ's Linda Lutton reports on what one Chicago museum is doing to promote that. And the answer is not just field trips. LINDA LUTTON, BYLINE: In a classroom across from the coal mine exhibit at the Museum of Science and Industry, students are peering into petri dishes. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: Well, the agar is a light pale yellow, the bacteria, the darker yellow. . . LUTTON: The students here are all teachers. All are responsible for imparting science to upper-elementary or middle-school students. And that is a job many here, and many teachers in grammar schools feel unprepared for. JOEL SPEARS: Definitely, that's why I'm here. I teach 5th grade, so I teach all the subjects. I went in not knowing how to teach science, really. I didn't have the materials or the know-how to even teach it properly. LUTTON: Once a month, Joel Spears and dozens of other teachers come to the museum for a day of lessons and materials they can take back to their classrooms across the Chicago metro region. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: So, you guys ready for this? UNIDENTIFIED TEACHERS: Sure. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: OK, come around with the Glo Germ. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: Rub it on both hands like lotion. LUTTON: Teacher Jonathan Fisher, a philosophy major who avoided life science in college but now teaches it to fourth-graders, taught genetics with an activity he learned here. JONATHAN FISHER: The students used Styrofoam blocks and different body parts, so limbs and dowel rods and different-sized eyes, flipping the coins to figure out which genes would be passed on to their kids. The classroom couldn't have been more excited. LUTTON: Today, teachers here will be given bottles of Glo Germ, diagrams of cells, petri dishes, even instructions on how to make a simple incubator where students can grow bacteria from their own dirty hands. Andrea Ingram oversees education at the Museum of Science and Industry. ANDREA INGRAM: One of the challenges in the U. S. in getting kids engaged in science is that we don't have enough really high-quality science teachers in the middle grades. And that's kind of like the early childhood of science. We either capture kids' enthusiasm there, get them committed to science, or we don't. LUTTON: Ingram says museums can be important partners in improving science education, especially given tight school budgets. Museums are popular with business and civic leaders, and where else can you find tornadoes, lightning and real cow eyeballs to dissect? But the real test of this teacher training program is in schools like Sawyer Elementary on Chicago's Southwest Side. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: About 20, 20. 4 centimeters. GRACIELA OLMOS: You get to keep the ruler there. Keep this height. It's just for you measure where you're going to read the marbles. LUTTON: Teacher Graciela Olmos first saw this lesson about mechanical energy at the museum. Now her 8th graders are rolling marbles down incline planes, measuring how far the marbles push a little Styrofoam cup. Olmos says she's used to being told to teach to higher standards. The museum has shown her how. OLMOS: They model for us, this is how it's going to look. And that's something that we lack. LUTTON: Though she won't say that's the only thing she lacks. OLMOS: We need so many things. We need to have science labs with gas lines and sinks. And if my specialty is science, well, let it be science. Don't give me so many other things to do aside of that. JOANNE OLSON: This has been a perpetual challenge for us in science education, particularly at the elementary grades. LUTTON: Joanne Olson is a professor of science education at Iowa State University and the president of the Association for Science Teacher Education. She's been advocating for years for schools to have science specialists. OLSON: It's like the P. E. teacher. You know, you have one teacher who's dedicated to that particular subject area, and that way the teacher can be very well-prepared in that area and doesn't have to take on literacy instruction, math and these other areas. LUTTON: Olson says a majority of elementary teachers have gotten fewer than six total hours of science training in the last three years. OLSON: So anything that can be done to help is a good thing. LUTTON: The Museum of Science and Industry is promising to train a thousand Chicago-area teachers in the next five years. Michigan State University recently released a study of the museum's teacher training program. It finds the teachers trained by the museum know more science, and significantly so do their students.

And don't worry if you hate math. Here's the weirdness in a nutshell. Say you have a line in space. It's 1-inch long and you want to divide it. Easy. You cut it in half, cut that half in half and so on and so on. But at some point you get to something so small you can't cut anymore. All those infinitely small things make up your line. They're so small they have a length of zero, because if it were any more than that, you could just keep on dividing. But hang on, that's impossible because even if you add up a billion zeroes, you get nothing. What happened to our line? That is what used to blow math minds in the days before quantum physics and LSD. Now, if you're willing to ignore those troubling questions, you could actually get some pretty useful math, like calculus. Amir Alexander says the fight over how to resolve the paradox informed real fighting, 500 years of wars and dispute that produced modern Europe. In his new book, \"Infinitesimal,\" Alexander says not everyone was willing to go along, starting with the Jesuits. AMIR ALEXANDER: They were coming really out of this crisis of the reformation where the old order and the church had been splintered apart. And their mission was to reestablish a proper hierarchical order. There was a Jesuit by the name of Christopher Clavius. And he believed that the answer is in mathematics, in particularly geometry because geometry is orderly. It is absolutely certain. And once you get results in geometry, nobody can argue with you. RATH: They're provable. ALEXANDER: Everything's absolutely provable. And no sane person can ever dispute something like the Pythagorean theorem. He said, if we could have theology like that and we get rid of all those pesky Protestants who keep arguing with us, right, because we could prove things. RATH: So to understand what was troubling about this paradox for the Jesuits and other representatives of this point of view, it was the fact that this could not be explained or was there something about the idea of something being so small it was indivisible? ALEXANDER: It really was the fact that there is a paradox. There was basically a mistake at the heart of mathematics, because the whole point of studying mathematics is because it is absolutely certain and everything is known, and everything has its place. And there is a very orderly hierarchy of results there. And now in the middle of that you throw this paradox and you can get all those strange results. That basically means that mathematics can't be trusted. And if mathematics can't be trusted, what else can? And they, the Jesuits, fought a long and hard campaign to try and wipe out this whole mathematical approach of infinitesimals. RATH: Well, people have been arguing about it since the Greeks. Did they really think they could wipe this concept off the face of the earth? ALEXANDER: They really did their best, and they succeeded very well in Italy. Italy was, before the 17th century and into the 17th century, it was really the mathematical capital of Europe. It had the greatest mathematicians, the greatest mathematical tradition. It was the leader in mathematics. . . RATH: . . . greatest astronomer. ALEXANDER: Yeah, Galileo and mathematicians like Cardano and Commandino and others. It was a very, very impressive tradition of mathematics, the best in Europe. And by the time the Jesuits were done, that was gone, all of it. By the 1670s, Italy was a complete backwater in mathematics and the sciences. RATH: Let's jump to England, because this is another wild aspect of this, that you tie this into basically the English Civil War. ALEXANDER: Absolutely. Because in England what happened was that during the civil war, the whole social order was suddenly under threat, those revolutionaries, those radical sects, all of them just bubbled and threatened the established order that was dominated by the propertied classes. And again, there were two approaches to this. One of them was represented by Thomas Hobbs, who's known today of course as a political philosopher. But at the time he also considered himself a mathematician and was widely acknowledged as a mathematician. And he thought the only way to reestablish order was, much like the Jesuits, just wipe off any possibility of dissent. Establish a state that is absolutely logical, where the laws of the sovereign have the force of a geometrical proof. On the other side, his personal enemy and rival for almost three decades was John Wallis. And he believed that the chance for that kind of order is gone. What you have to build now is some space where dissent can be allowed, within limits at least, where not everything can be known at any given time, and build a society and build a social order from the ground up, rather than imposing it by one single law. RATH: So if the Jesuits and Thomas Hobbs had won, had been able to shut the door on the infinitesimal, what would the Western world look like now, do you think? ALEXANDER: Well, I think things would've been very different. I think if they had won then it would've been a much more hierarchical society. There was certainly, in a world like that, there would not be room for democracy, there would not be room for dissent. Most likely we would not have also all this great accomplishments that mathematics is at the heart of today. Modern science, modern technology, and everything from your cell phone to this radio station to airplanes, to cars and trains, it is all fundamentally dependent on this technique of infinitesimals.

I'm Guy Raz. Today's show - ideas around how we love. And the thing about love is that for at least a century, scientists have been getting closer to the mystery of how it works. HELEN FISHER: You know, the elation, the giddiness, the euphoria, the energy, the possessiveness, the craving, the obsession. RAZ: This is Helen Fisher. She teaches at Rutgers. FISHER: I'm a biological anthropologist, and I study love, romance and personality. I'm also chief scientific advisor to Match. com, the dating service. RAZ: That's cool. That's actually - the academic stuff - eh. It's the Match. com that's cool. FISHER: Well, thank you. RAZ: Helen looks at the science behind love. And her research is based on one big idea - that our brains are actually wired to fall in love, that there's actually a drive, a brain circuitry that developed millions of years ago that's devoted entirely to romantic love. FISHER: People have resisted thinking that romantic love actually is a brain system. They're scared that it will break the magic. They want romantic love to be part of the supernatural. RAZ: But why can't that brain chemistry be kind of supernatural? FISHER: Well, on some level, I mean - I don't know. I'm a scientist. I put people in brain scanners. (LAUGHTER)FISHER: But, you know, when it actually happens to you, it can feel supernatural. I mean, why isn't it supernatural? 'Cause it's housed in the brain. Why do we want to feel that it's supernatural? 'Cause it feels so good. RAZ: OK, so this brain system, it's kind of like a. . . FISHER: Sleeping cat. It can be awakened at any time. RAZ: Any time, any place. And it's partly because. . . FISHER: As you grow up, you begin to build what I call an unconscious list of what you're looking for in a partner, which I call your love map. RAZ: For example, when you walk into a party and. . . FISHER: Boom, you look up at her. She fits within that love map. It triggers that brain circuitry and boom. You're off to the races. RAZ: And all of a sudden, your brain starts flying through this very subjective list of criteria. FISHER: Too tall, too short, too fat, too thin, too old, too young, too scruffy - they're out. Wrong accent - they're out. They smile at you, they don't have any teeth - they're out. RAZ: And if that person makes the cut, your brain. . . FISHER: Is becoming active, is giving you that pleasing sensation, is pumping out the dopamine to make you feel more optimistic, energetic. You feel that intense rush. RAZ: And it happens in a flash. And you're not really sure what's going on, but you know something is going on. So what's happening? Well, Helen explains the science behind it on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)FISHER: I and my colleagues, Art Aron and Lucy Brown and others, have put 37 people who were madly in love into a functional MRI brain scanner, 17 who were happily in love, 15 who had just been dumped. And we're just starting our third experiment studying people who report that they're still in love after 10 to 25 years of marriage. So we found activity in a tiny, little factory near the base of the brain called the ventral tegmental area. We found activity in some cells called the A10 cells, cells that actually make dopamine, a natural stimulant, and spray it to many brain regions. Indeed this part, the VTA, is part of the brain's reward system. It's part of what we call the reptilian core of the brain associated with wanting, with motivation, with focus and with craving. In fact, the same brain region where we found activity becomes active also when you feel the rush of cocaine. RAZ: OK, but, I mean - but, like, what makes you get that rush for one person, right, over somebody else? FISHER: Well, I wondered about that, and of course this is what interested me so much with Match. com. They asked me, why do you fall in love with one person rather than another? RAZ: Yeah. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)FISHER: And so I've spent the last three years on this. And psychologists can tell you, we tend to fall in love with somebody from the same socioeconomic background, the same general level of intelligence, the same general level of good looks. And that's about it. That's all they know. They have never found the way two personalities fit together to make a good relationship. So it began to occur to me that maybe your biology pulls you towards some people rather than another. And I have concocted a questionnaire to see to what degree you express dopamine, serotonin, estrogen and testosterone. I think we've evolved four very broad personality types associated with the ratios of these four chemicals in the brain. And on this dating site that I've created called Chemistry. com, I ask you first a series of questions to see to what degree you express these chemicals. And I'm watching who chooses who to love. RAZ: Helen calls the series of questions the Fisher Temperament Inventory - 56 questions that can gauge whether you have higher or lower levels of certain brain chemicals. And the questions include things like, do you change your mind easily? Or is it important to you to respect authority? And do you prefer interesting friends or loyal friends? FISHER: And over 13 million people have now have taken that questionnaire. About 30,000 take it every month on Chemistry. com. So, you know, it's big data. I mean, Match. com enabled me to really collect a lot of big data. RAZ: So what did you find out? FISHER: As it turns out, people who are very high on the dopamine system - curious, creative, spontaneous, energetic - they go for people like themselves. People who are traditional - the serotonin system - they also go for people like themselves. In the other two cases, opposites attract. People with the traits linked with the testosterone system - the analytical, logical, direct, decisive, tough-minded - they go for their opposite. People who are very expressive of the estrogen system - imaginative, intuitive, good verbal skills, good people skills - they also go for their opposite. RAZ: So when this happens and you meet your perfect neurochemical match, your brain is in love. You are literally addicted to that person. And then you get dumped. FISHER: People who've been rejected in love show activity in brain regions linked with pain. In fact, one of the brain regions is a brain region that also becomes active when you feel tooth pain. So it's a really powerfully, painful - literally painful experience when you've been rejected in love. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)FISHER: Lucy Brown and I, the neuroscientist on our project, are looking at the data of the people who were put into the machine after they had just been dumped. It was not a - it was very difficult actually, putting these people in the machine 'cause they were in such bad shape. (LAUGHTER)FISHER: So anyway, we found activity in exactly the same brain region associated with intense romantic love. You know, when you've been dumped, the one thing you'd love to do is just forget about this human being and then go on with your life. But no, you just love them harder. That brain system, the reward system for wanting, for motivation, for craving, for focus becomes more active when you can't get what you want, in this case, life's greatest prize - an appropriate mating partner. RAZ: I mean, there is, like, a human need for companionship. FISHER: Right. RAZ: I mean, we need that, like - I mean, what is it about that? Like, why? FISHER: Because millions of years ago, the trees began to disappear, and we had to get out. And we began to climb on down, and they would rush out onto the grasslands and stand up on two feet, collect what they could to eat and race back to a place where they were protected. With the beginning of standing came walking. And with that, women had to begin to carry their babies in their arms instead of on their back. So females began to need a partner to help them rear their baby, and we evolved, in the human animal, the brain circuitry for romantic love and for deep, profound attachment to another individual - the very hallmarks of humanity. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)FISHER: So what have I learned from this experiment that I would like to tell the world? Foremost, I've come to think that romantic love is a drive - a basic mating drive, not the sex drive. The sex drive gets you out there for a whole range of partners. Romantic love enables you to focus your mating energy on just one at a time, conserve your mating energy and start the mating process with a single individual. What sums it up best is something that is said by Plato over 2000 years ago. He said the God of love lives in the state of need. It is a need. It is an urge. It is a homeostatic imbalance. Like hunger and thirst, it's almost impossible to stamp out. So my final statement is love is in us. It's deeply embedded in the brain. Our challenge is to understand each other. Thank you. (APPLAUSE)RAZ: Helen Fisher. She wrote about her ground-breaking research in the book \"Why We Love. \" She's given several other TED talks. Check out all of them at TED. com. GUY RAZ, HOST:  It's the TED Radio Hour from NPR. I'm Guy Raz. Today's show - ideas around how we love. And the thing about love is that for at least a century, scientists have been getting closer to the mystery of how it works. HELEN FISHER: You know, the elation, the giddiness, the euphoria, the energy, the possessiveness, the craving, the obsession. RAZ: This is Helen Fisher. She teaches at Rutgers. FISHER: I'm a biological anthropologist, and I study love, romance and personality. I'm also chief scientific advisor to Match. com, the dating service. RAZ: That's cool. That's actually - the academic stuff - eh. It's the Match. com that's cool. FISHER: Well, thank you. RAZ: Helen looks at the science behind love. And her research is based on one big idea - that our brains are actually wired to fall in love, that there's actually a drive, a brain circuitry that developed millions of years ago that's devoted entirely to romantic love. FISHER: People have resisted thinking that romantic love actually is a brain system. They're scared that it will break the magic. They want romantic love to be part of the supernatural. RAZ: But why can't that brain chemistry be kind of supernatural? FISHER: Well, on some level, I mean - I don't know. I'm a scientist. I put people in brain scanners. (LAUGHTER) FISHER: But, you know, when it actually happens to you, it can feel supernatural. I mean, why isn't it supernatural? 'Cause it's housed in the brain. Why do we want to feel that it's supernatural? 'Cause it feels so good. RAZ: OK, so this brain system, it's kind of like a. . . FISHER: Sleeping cat. It can be awakened at any time. RAZ: Any time, any place. And it's partly because. . . FISHER: As you grow up, you begin to build what I call an unconscious list of what you're looking for in a partner, which I call your love map. RAZ: For example, when you walk into a party and. . . FISHER: Boom, you look up at her. She fits within that love map. It triggers that brain circuitry and boom. You're off to the races. RAZ: And all of a sudden, your brain starts flying through this very subjective list of criteria. FISHER: Too tall, too short, too fat, too thin, too old, too young, too scruffy - they're out. Wrong accent - they're out. They smile at you, they don't have any teeth - they're out. RAZ: And if that person makes the cut, your brain. . . FISHER: Is becoming active, is giving you that pleasing sensation, is pumping out the dopamine to make you feel more optimistic, energetic. You feel that intense rush. RAZ: And it happens in a flash. And you're not really sure what's going on, but you know something is going on. So what's happening? Well, Helen explains the science behind it on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) FISHER: I and my colleagues, Art Aron and Lucy Brown and others, have put 37 people who were madly in love into a functional MRI brain scanner, 17 who were happily in love, 15 who had just been dumped. And we're just starting our third experiment studying people who report that they're still in love after 10 to 25 years of marriage. So we found activity in a tiny, little factory near the base of the brain called the ventral tegmental area. We found activity in some cells called the A10 cells, cells that actually make dopamine, a natural stimulant, and spray it to many brain regions. Indeed this part, the VTA, is part of the brain's reward system. It's part of what we call the reptilian core of the brain associated with wanting, with motivation, with focus and with craving. In fact, the same brain region where we found activity becomes active also when you feel the rush of cocaine. RAZ: OK, but, I mean - but, like, what makes you get that rush for one person, right, over somebody else? FISHER: Well, I wondered about that, and of course this is what interested me so much with Match. com. They asked me, why do you fall in love with one person rather than another? RAZ: Yeah. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) FISHER: And so I've spent the last three years on this. And psychologists can tell you, we tend to fall in love with somebody from the same socioeconomic background, the same general level of intelligence, the same general level of good looks. And that's about it. That's all they know. They have never found the way two personalities fit together to make a good relationship. So it began to occur to me that maybe your biology pulls you towards some people rather than another. And I have concocted a questionnaire to see to what degree you express dopamine, serotonin, estrogen and testosterone. I think we've evolved four very broad personality types associated with the ratios of these four chemicals in the brain. And on this dating site that I've created called Chemistry. com, I ask you first a series of questions to see to what degree you express these chemicals. And I'm watching who chooses who to love. RAZ: Helen calls the series of questions the Fisher Temperament Inventory - 56 questions that can gauge whether you have higher or lower levels of certain brain chemicals. And the questions include things like, do you change your mind easily? Or is it important to you to respect authority? And do you prefer interesting friends or loyal friends? FISHER: And over 13 million people have now have taken that questionnaire. About 30,000 take it every month on Chemistry. com. So, you know, it's big data. I mean, Match. com enabled me to really collect a lot of big data. RAZ: So what did you find out? FISHER: As it turns out, people who are very high on the dopamine system - curious, creative, spontaneous, energetic - they go for people like themselves. People who are traditional - the serotonin system - they also go for people like themselves. In the other two cases, opposites attract. People with the traits linked with the testosterone system - the analytical, logical, direct, decisive, tough-minded - they go for their opposite. People who are very expressive of the estrogen system - imaginative, intuitive, good verbal skills, good people skills - they also go for their opposite. RAZ: So when this happens and you meet your perfect neurochemical match, your brain is in love. You are literally addicted to that person. And then you get dumped. FISHER: People who've been rejected in love show activity in brain regions linked with pain. In fact, one of the brain regions is a brain region that also becomes active when you feel tooth pain. So it's a really powerfully, painful - literally painful experience when you've been rejected in love. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) FISHER: Lucy Brown and I, the neuroscientist on our project, are looking at the data of the people who were put into the machine after they had just been dumped. It was not a - it was very difficult actually, putting these people in the machine 'cause they were in such bad shape. (LAUGHTER) FISHER: So anyway, we found activity in exactly the same brain region associated with intense romantic love. You know, when you've been dumped, the one thing you'd love to do is just forget about this human being and then go on with your life. But no, you just love them harder. That brain system, the reward system for wanting, for motivation, for craving, for focus becomes more active when you can't get what you want, in this case, life's greatest prize - an appropriate mating partner. RAZ: I mean, there is, like, a human need for companionship. FISHER: Right. RAZ: I mean, we need that, like - I mean, what is it about that? Like, why? FISHER: Because millions of years ago, the trees began to disappear, and we had to get out. And we began to climb on down, and they would rush out onto the grasslands and stand up on two feet, collect what they could to eat and race back to a place where they were protected. With the beginning of standing came walking. And with that, women had to begin to carry their babies in their arms instead of on their back. So females began to need a partner to help them rear their baby, and we evolved, in the human animal, the brain circuitry for romantic love and for deep, profound attachment to another individual - the very hallmarks of humanity. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) FISHER: So what have I learned from this experiment that I would like to tell the world? Foremost, I've come to think that romantic love is a drive - a basic mating drive, not the sex drive. The sex drive gets you out there for a whole range of partners. Romantic love enables you to focus your mating energy on just one at a time, conserve your mating energy and start the mating process with a single individual. What sums it up best is something that is said by Plato over 2000 years ago. He said the God of love lives in the state of need. It is a need. It is an urge. It is a homeostatic imbalance. Like hunger and thirst, it's almost impossible to stamp out. So my final statement is love is in us. It's deeply embedded in the brain. Our challenge is to understand each other. Thank you.

ESTHER PEREL: It's an experience. It's an experience that is mental, emotional, physical, sensual, sensory. It's all-encompassing. That's part of why it's so grand is because it leaves any part of us - it doesn't leave any part of us untouched. RAZ: Oh, can you introduce yourself, please? PEREL: I'm Esther Perel. I'm a couples therapist, and I'm the author of the book \"Mating in Captivity\" as well as a sex therapist. RAZ: When people meet you and you say I'm Esther Perel, I wrote this book, you might have heard of it, \"Mating in Captivity,\" what's the - like, the most common question you get from people? PEREL: Well, the first reaction is usually to the title, \"Mating in Captivity. \" Some people know exactly what I mean, and they understand immediately that we don't necessarily like to mate in captivity. And so then the next question is, so can desire be sustained in the long haul? Can you reconcile the domestic and the erotic in one relationship? Can you reconcile intimacy and sexuality with the same person for the long haul? RAZ: And those questions, they're at the heart of what Esther Perel's been studying for 30 years, questions she explores on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)PEREL: So why does good sex so often fade even for couples who continue to love each other as much as ever? And why does good intimacy not guarantee good sex contrary to popular belief? Or the next question would be, can we want what we already have? That's the million dollar question, right? And why is the forbidden so erotic? What is it about transgression that makes desire so potent? And why does sex make babies, and babies spell erotic disaster in couples? (LAUGHTER)PEREL: It's kind of the fatal erotic blow, isn't it? And when you love, how does it feel? And when you desire, how is it different? These are some of the questions that are at the center of my exploration on the nature of erotic desire and its concomitant dilemmas in modern love. So I travel the globe, and what I'm noticing is that everywhere where romanticism has entered, there seems to be a crisis of desire - a crisis of desire as in owning the wanting, desire as an expression of our individuality, of our free choice, of our preferences, of our identity, desire that has become a central concept as part of modern love and individualistic societies. Desire was never the organizing principle of sexuality, for sure, in marriage. You know, we had sex because we needed lots of children, and we had sex because it was a woman's marital duty. So desire is very much a concept of our society, of our culture today. We have a consumer society. We have a society that has the 'I' in the center. And this 'I' knows who she is and knows what he wants, and is constantly urged to define it and to want more. RAZ: And so what does that do? What's the result? PEREL: We crumble under the weight of expectations. You know, we've never invested more in love, and we've never divorced more in the name of love. We're not having very nice results. That doesn't mean that when we had less expectations, marriages were happier occasions. But people had different expectations of life. You know, one of the most important things we've done around marriage is that we've brought happiness down from the heaven and made it first a possibility. And today, it's a mandate. So, you know, am I happy in my marriage? When was that ever such an important question? This idea that my marriage is supposed to give me something, that I'm supposed to get something from my partner and that my partner owes me that because somehow it was implicit in our agreement, in our joining together that we were going to give each other things, like, I'll never feel alone again. I'll never worry about abandonment. I'll never feel disconnected. I'll never feel unnoticed. It's just - it's. . . RAZ: Thing is - I mean, the thing is, is that, like - I mean, marriage is great. Like, it - you know, I'm speaking for myself here of course. But, I mean, it is that person. It is that person that is, you know - that person is your best friend. And that's our expectation. And I guess. . . PEREL: In America. But I can tell you, I go to many parts of the world where I don't ever hear people say my partner is my best friend. They have best friends, and that's not their partner. Their partner is their partner. That's a different thing. And frankly, many people treat their partners in ways that they would never treat their best friends and allow themselves to say and do things that no best friend whatever accept. Friendship does not operate along the same lines. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)PEREL: So what sustains desire, and why is it so difficult? And at the heart of sustaining desire in a committed relationship, I think, is the reconciliation of two fundamental human needs. On the one hand, our need for security, for predictability, for safety, for dependability, for reliability, for permanence - all these anchoring, grounding experiences of our lives that we call home. But we also have an equally strong need - men and women - for adventure, for novelty, for mystery, for risk, for danger, for the unknown, for the unexpected, surprise - you get the gist - for journey, for travel. So reconciling our need for security and our need for adventure into one relationship, or what we today like to call a passionate marriage, used to be a contradiction in terms. Marriage was an economic institution in which you were given a partnership for life in terms of children and social status and succession and companionship. But now we want our partner to still give us all these things, but in addition, I want you to be my best friend and my trusted confidant and my passionate lover to boot. And we live twice as long. (LAUGHTER)PEREL: So we come to one person, and we basically are asking them to give us what once an entire village used to provide. Give me belonging, give me identity, give me continuity, but give me transcendence and mystery and all in one. Give me comfort. Give me edge. Give me novelty. Give me familiarity. Give me predictability. Give me surprise. And we think it's a given, and toys and lingerie are going to save us with that. (LAUGHTER)RAZ: I mean, so if marriage has, like - if marriage has evolved under this thing that's, like, so - I don't know - like, fraught with potential problems and pitfalls and obstacles, like, how do we save it and improve it? PEREL: Oh, yes, I get that question all the time. And I have a different answer every day. RAZ: Yeah. What do you say? PEREL: Oh, it ranges from, you know - the secret to a happy relationship - I don't think in those terms actually is the first thing. It's, like, not my language. RAZ: (Laughter). PEREL: I don't think about secrets, nor keys to, nor seven ways to, nor, you know, 10 steps. RAZ: You don't have the answer for us - just, like, the. . . PEREL: No. RAZ: . . . Bumper-sticker answer? PEREL: No. But I do have a sense, in the American context, it's often a can-do question. You know, this is a society who thinks that every problem has a solution. And then one of my answers is that this dilemma between our need for security and our need for adventure and how we're trying to bring them together under one roof is maybe more a paradox that we manage and less a problem that we solve.

I'm Eric Westervelt. SCOTT KELLY: I listened to that in space when I was exercising, ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. WESTERVELT: You did? KELLY: Yeah. WESTERVELT: That's Astronaut Scott Kelly. KELLY: Yeah, when I was doing the resistive, like the weight lifting, it was good, you know, to listen to NPR. Although I don't listen to NPR on Earth much just because I don't know what channel it's on. WESTERVELT: Wait. Well, let me get that straight. You could find us at the International Space Station but you can't find us on terra firma. OK. KELLY: Yeah, it's easy to find in space because they send it up to you directly so. . . WESTERVELT: That's bizarre. Beginning next March, Scott will be at the International Space Station for an entire year. While he's up there, he'll be part of some novel experiments with his brother Mark. Mark's also an astronaut and also Scott's identical twin. Scott Kelly and Mark Kelly, welcome to the program. Thanks for coming in. SCOTT AND MARK KELLY: Oh, it's great to be here. Thank you. (LAUGHTER)WESTERVELT: It's tough on the radio. Listeners can't really see you but you guys are identical twins. What do you look like? Tell us. Mark, you go first. MARK KELLY: What do we look like? Well, I look like him and he looks like me. You know, two regular guys from New Jersey. KELLY: . . . that are about 50 years old. WESTERVELT: Middle-aged guys? KELLY: Well, you know, you could characterize it as that but, you know, 50's the new 30, right? That's what people tell me. WESTERVELT: Where did this idea come from to test whether identical siblings remain the same if one's in space and the other's on the ground? KELLY: When I was assigned to this flight, we were getting ready to announce it at a press conference. And I was given a briefing from the science people on the type of science we would be doing and looking at on this one-year flight. And I asked them if someone was to ask the question about doing some kind of comparative studies between my brother and I, considering that, I mean, it was kind of ironic or interesting, maybe serendipitous that after this flight I will have flown about 540 days compared to his 54, so an order of magnitude more. And they came to the conclusion that there was merit in this in doing this type of investigation that is mostly based on our genetics and the affect on our genetics from long-duration space flight. WESTERVELT: Mark, you'll be on the ground. You've arguably got the easier part of this. What will your day-to-day life be like in terms of these experiments while Scott's in space? Will you have to do daily, weekly monitoring and tests? KELLY: Well, that we don't know yet. You know, I did ask NASA to try to, you know, pull some of these studies together, right? So if you need - you know, if they need to draw blood for one study, let's do that on the same day for the others. You know, the same thing with stuff like urine samples and ultrasounds and maybe a CT scan. As a NASA astronaut over, you know, a 15-year period, had a lot of science done on me already. So I kind of know what I'm getting myself into. Something might include doing a 24-hour urine sample, Which means you're carrying a bucket around with you essentially. WESTERVELT: That'll be interesting at barbecues. KELLY: Yeah, yeah, it is. It's interesting at barbecues. The kids usually get, you know, a little laugh out of, you know, dad's pee being in the refrigerator. WESTERVELT: Right. KELLY: So there are things like that, but I don't have a schedule yet. WESTERVELT: Researchers, as I understand it, already know a little bit that the human immune system changes a lot in space. I mean, which of you do you think will be healthier at the end of the year? Scott? KELLY: Good question. You know, there's a lot of impacts and effects on the human body due to long-duration space flight. You lose bone and muscle mass. . . KELLY: Yeah, his bones are going to turn to dust in a year. (LAUGHTER)KELLY: And you get radiation that could, you know, increase your risk of fatal cancer over your lifetime. As far as overall health, you exercise a lot, so that's a plus. But, you know, there's also those unknowns about your immune system. So it's - you know, that's what we're hoping to learn. WESTERVELT: And are you guys going to be competitive about this at all, like Mark, maybe you'll exercise more and avoid a few cheeseburgers just to try to beat Scott? KELLY: Well, yeah, maybe. You never know. I mean, you know. Yeah, I'll be working out twice a day I think, or two hours a day, six days a week. So maybe it'll motivate me a little bit. WESTERVELT: Scott Kelly and Mark Kelly are both astronauts. They're also identical twins. The brothers Kelly, thanks very much. KELLY: Oh, you're welcome. KELLY: Yeah, thank you, my pleasure.

SCOTT KELLY: I listened to that in space when I was exercising, ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. WESTERVELT: You did? KELLY: Yeah. WESTERVELT: That's Astronaut Scott Kelly. KELLY: Yeah, when I was doing the resistive, like the weight lifting, it was good, you know, to listen to NPR. Although I don't listen to NPR on Earth much just because I don't know what channel it's on. WESTERVELT: Wait. Well, let me get that straight. You could find us at the International Space Station but you can't find us on terra firma. OK. KELLY: Yeah, it's easy to find in space because they send it up to you directly so. . . WESTERVELT: That's bizarre. Beginning next March, Scott will be at the International Space Station for an entire year. While he's up there, he'll be part of some novel experiments with his brother Mark. Mark's also an astronaut and also Scott's identical twin. Scott Kelly and Mark Kelly, welcome to the program. Thanks for coming in. SCOTT AND MARK KELLY: Oh, it's great to be here. Thank you. (LAUGHTER) WESTERVELT: It's tough on the radio. Listeners can't really see you but you guys are identical twins. What do you look like? Tell us. Mark, you go first. MARK KELLY: What do we look like? Well, I look like him and he looks like me. You know, two regular guys from New Jersey. KELLY: . . . that are about 50 years old. WESTERVELT: Middle-aged guys? KELLY: Well, you know, you could characterize it as that but, you know, 50's the new 30, right? That's what people tell me. WESTERVELT: Where did this idea come from to test whether identical siblings remain the same if one's in space and the other's on the ground? KELLY: When I was assigned to this flight, we were getting ready to announce it at a press conference. And I was given a briefing from the science people on the type of science we would be doing and looking at on this one-year flight. And I asked them if someone was to ask the question about doing some kind of comparative studies between my brother and I, considering that, I mean, it was kind of ironic or interesting, maybe serendipitous that after this flight I will have flown about 540 days compared to his 54, so an order of magnitude more. And they came to the conclusion that there was merit in this in doing this type of investigation that is mostly based on our genetics and the affect on our genetics from long-duration space flight. WESTERVELT: Mark, you'll be on the ground. You've arguably got the easier part of this. What will your day-to-day life be like in terms of these experiments while Scott's in space? Will you have to do daily, weekly monitoring and tests? KELLY: Well, that we don't know yet. You know, I did ask NASA to try to, you know, pull some of these studies together, right? So if you need - you know, if they need to draw blood for one study, let's do that on the same day for the others. You know, the same thing with stuff like urine samples and ultrasounds and maybe a CT scan. As a NASA astronaut over, you know, a 15-year period, had a lot of science done on me already. So I kind of know what I'm getting myself into. Something might include doing a 24-hour urine sample, Which means you're carrying a bucket around with you essentially. WESTERVELT: That'll be interesting at barbecues. KELLY: Yeah, yeah, it is. It's interesting at barbecues. The kids usually get, you know, a little laugh out of, you know, dad's pee being in the refrigerator. WESTERVELT: Right. KELLY: So there are things like that, but I don't have a schedule yet. WESTERVELT: Researchers, as I understand it, already know a little bit that the human immune system changes a lot in space. I mean, which of you do you think will be healthier at the end of the year? Scott? KELLY: Good question. You know, there's a lot of impacts and effects on the human body due to long-duration space flight. You lose bone and muscle mass. . . KELLY: Yeah, his bones are going to turn to dust in a year. (LAUGHTER) KELLY: And you get radiation that could, you know, increase your risk of fatal cancer over your lifetime. As far as overall health, you exercise a lot, so that's a plus. But, you know, there's also those unknowns about your immune system. So it's - you know, that's what we're hoping to learn. WESTERVELT: And are you guys going to be competitive about this at all, like Mark, maybe you'll exercise more and avoid a few cheeseburgers just to try to beat Scott? KELLY: Well, yeah, maybe. You never know. I mean, you know. Yeah, I'll be working out twice a day I think, or two hours a day, six days a week. So maybe it'll motivate me a little bit. WESTERVELT: Scott Kelly and Mark Kelly are both astronauts. They're also identical twins. The brothers Kelly, thanks very much. KELLY: Oh, you're welcome. KELLY: Yeah, thank you, my pleasure. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) WESTERVELT: Coming up, long lost recordings from 1969 finally see the light of day. Legendary record producer Lou Adler once scoured the Baptist churches in South Central L. A. to find the soul of Bob Dylan. LOU ADLER: I would go to church not to pray but to listen to the music.

And NPR's Allison Keyes was one of them and she brings us this report. ALLISON KEYES, BYLINE: Huge lines of people - kids in tow - are waiting to get into the world's second most visited museum. Right inside the lobby is a cast of the skull of the new T. rex the museum just acquired. It's stopping visitors dead in their tracks. CRYSTAL EPLEY: Yeah. We wanted to get up here before the exhibit for the dinosaurs closed. KEYES: Crystal Epley took a three hour trip from Broadway, Va. , to bring her son, John. She can't believe it's closing for five whole years. C. EPLEY: He's five, so we made sure to come 'cause he'll be 10. He may not be interested in dinosaurs by the time it reopens. KEYES: So why does he like dinosaurs? JOHN EPLEY: 'Cause they were big. KEYES: Yeah they were big. What's your favorite dinosaur? J. EPLEY: A T. rex. KEYES: Would you try to pet him? J. EPLEY: Mm-hmm. KEYES: Yeah. I would've, too. The Tyrannosaurus rex is the number one favorite of the kids and adults swarming through the exhibition. UNIDENTIFIED CHILD: T. rex. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: T. rex. KEYES: The dinosaur hall is so packed, you can hardly move for the strollers, the picture takers and the fossilphiles. Five-year-old Jack Prodromo is clear about what he thinks about the extinct carnivore made popular by movies ranging from \"Jurassic Park\" to \"Night at the Museum. \"JAKE PRODROMO: I love him. KEYES: Jack's mom, Karen, says the family is visiting from San Francisco, and she can't believe the hall is shutting down. KAREN PRODROMO: What're they going to do with all dinosaurs? MATTHEW CARRANO: Every single dinosaur in the hall has got to get dismantled. KEYES: Matthew Carrano is curator of Dinosauria at the museum. There are more than 2,000 specimens in the current hall that have to be carefully taken apart, cleaned and remounted. He says that includes huge skeletons like the diplodocus. CARRANO: We've got to decide what it's going to look like. We've got to put it back together again and reinstall it. KEYES: Plus, the way the dinosaurs are mounted will be different. As Carrano says, experts have learned much about the way the reptiles lived in the decades since they were first put on display. CARRANO: In, you know, the older days, they were often there almost as, like, trophies, so they're often just standing. And we want them to be kind of capturing a moment from when they were alive. So I think the philosophy is quite different. KEYES: The museum's new Tyrannosaurus rex - one of the largest and most complete skeletons ever discovered - will be the centerpiece of the new hall set to open in 2019. But there will be some temporary dinosaur-related exhibitions going on during the renovation, says curator Kay Barensmeyer. In November, an exhibition is opening featuring a T. rex model. KAY BARENSMEYER: And we will have Triceratops. And we will have the world of the last dinosaurs before the asteroid hit so there's drama. There's a lot of things that you can learn. KEYES: Also, there's a rex room open now through October, where people can watch staff unpack and do a 3-D scan of the 66 million-year-old bones of the new T. rex. And in May, the augmented reality dinosaurs exhibition will allow visitors to virtually interact with dinosaurs. IVANA LAWRENCE: We're here pretty much once every other week, I would say. KEYES: But for dino fans like Ivana Lawrence and her four-year-old son, Dominic, it's just not going to be the same. I. LAWRENCE: I don't know how I'm going to explain it to him, honestly, you know. KEYES: Dominic can name more than just one dinosaur. DOMINIC LAWRENCE: Tyrannosaurus - T. rex. Stegosaurus. KEYES: And he knows what the armored dinosaur with the plates running from its neck to its tail eats. D. LAWRENCE: Grass. KEYES: And why is Dominic such a dinosaur fan? D. LAWRENCE: They're cool.

The story starts back in 1978. That's when a spacecraft called ISEE-3 - International Sun Earth Explorer No. 3 - went into space, orbiting around a point between the Earth and the sun. That's called a halo orbit. Its job was to measure what we now call space weather. Well, then years later, through some NASA wizardry, it was moved. It was renamed ICE, International Cometary Explorer. And in 1985, it became the first spacecraft to fly past a comet, confirming that comets are basically big, dirty snowballs. Well, now - long story short - ICE has been little used since the 1990s. There's been only intermittent communication with it for decades. And NASA does not intend to spend any more money on it. Well, enter a couple of former NASA guys and the crowdfunding site RocketHub, where they are trying to raise cash to bring ICE back to life for its original purposes. Former NASA employee Keith Cowing is here to explain. Hiya. KEITH COWING: Hi. SIEGEL: NASA has basically given its blessing to you to revive one of its satellites. How's that? COWING: Well, but they haven't said no and they said yeah, we'll help. But they're sort of in a predicament here, where they do have budget issues - which are real. And we just saw this opportunity to grab something that might still work and with a little hackery and MacGyvery, bring it back to life. SIEGEL: And what's the point of doing that? COWING: Well, A, because we can; B, because it still works; and C, can actually do something useful. Our slogan is: Make me do science again. SIEGEL: But this is a long shot, I gather. One blogger back in February wrote that it just was impossible to re-establish communication. You disagree with that? COWING: I absolutely disagree. They also said that the radio telescope dish that we use to listen to it at Morehead State couldn't hear it. Well, we keep hearing it every day. We'll know if we can't do it if we try to do it. SIEGEL: And you have all of the manuals and all of the instructions for working with this late '70s vintage craft? COWING: We are reassembling that collection. We've got a good start. We're talking to a lot of guys in their 70s and 80s who say that, you know, my wife said I have to get rid of this stuff - after 30 or 40 years - and we're happy to take it. SIEGEL: I gather that you are trying to raise $125,000, which to my ear, for anything connected with NASA or a satellite, sounds ridiculously little. COWING: Yeah, and we actually thought maybe we're asking a little bit too much. But we did the math, and that's what we need. SIEGEL: To do what? What do you do with $125,000? COWING: Well, we - first of all, we need to buy some transmitters that we have to hang off some radio telescopes; that's real money. We have to get a couple of guys to stop what they're doing, to do some re-creation of the hardware that no longer exists. And of course, there's a fee for the crowdfunding. But at the end of the day, it's pretty bare-bones. SIEGEL: How far are you towards that goal? COWING: Well, we have guys working on the software radio right now. We've assembled documents. We've got people rebuilding a lot of the command systems that were used. SIEGEL: But you need $125,000. How much has been pledged so far? COWING: As we speak, it's about $52,000. SIEGEL: Almost halfway there. COWING: Yes, sir. SIEGEL: Now, when I asked you what's the point of this - is, your first answer was you want to do it because you can do it. But to somebody who's not part of the team, what's the benefit of getting this spacecraft communicating again? COWING: Well, after you go from because we can, the spacecraft probably does have a number of its original instruments still in operation. And NASA said well, you know, we can't afford this but if you guys get that back into the orbit that it was in, and it can start sending data again, that data has usefulness. SIEGEL: Given that you say this 1978 satellite doesn't deserve to be declared junk just yet. COWING: Oh, heavens no. Like finding something in your garage, and you dust it off and you plug it in, and it works; and then your wife says, well, where are you going to put it? And say, well, how about in the spare bedroom? SIEGEL: Although sometimes you say, well, where are the records to play on that thing that's been in the garage all. . . (LAUGHTER)SIEGEL: Well, but I mean. when would it naturally die? I mean, does it have another 30 years in it? COWING: Well, you know, the thing has had its transmitter on nonstop since 1978. It's like the Voyagers, which left Earth about the same time. And they're a little hard of hearing, but they've left our solar system and they're still working. So odds are if it's on, if it's been working this long, it'll continue working for quite some time. SIEGEL: Well, Keith Cowing, good luck with it. COWING: Thank you, sir.

Joining us now to explain what's been happening is NPR's health correspondent Rob Stein. And, Rob, what are these drugs exactly and how do they work? ROB STEIN, BYLINE: Yeah, Robert. You know, for years, there was a standard way to execute someone in the United States by injecting them with drugs. And this was a three-drug cocktail that the Supreme Court had ruled was constitutional. Now, here's how it worked. The first drug was called sodium thiopental, and that basically knocked the person out, it made them unconscious. The second drug is called pancuronium bromide, and that basically would paralyze the inmate so they couldn't move. And then finally they would administer a drug called potassium chloride. That's a toxin that would stop their heart. And that's the drug that would kill them. Now, this cocktail was actually, coincidentally, created by a medical examiner in Oklahoma - same state - in 1977. I've spoken to Dr. Jay Chapman several times over the years as controversy has arisen over this cocktail. SIEGEL: Yeah, the controversy began after states started having difficulties getting those drugs in recent years. Remind us again of what happened. STEIN: This is actually part of a broader problem that we've been having in this country where there's been shortages of lots of different drugs and there's been a variety of factors that have contributed to that. One of them is the consolidation in the pharmaceutical industry. So, there are fewer and fewer companies making a lot of these drugs and sometimes only one or two. And when it hit the lethal injection issue because when a company that is based in Italy, actually, decided that it no longer wanted to ship the first drug, sodium thiopenthal, to the United States because of objections to the death penalty in the United States. And that started companies, states scrambling to find other sources of drugs. Then a Danish company stopped shipping another drug that had been used to replace that drug. And then the EU banned distributing these drugs to the United States. States started looking to other countries, like Britain and Germany, and that ran into problems with other government agencies, like the Food and Drug Administration and the Drug Enforcement Agency. And then finally, they ended up turning to these compounding pharmacies, which are small pharmacies that mix small batches of drugs. SIEGEL: Rob, which are still making the three drugs or a mishmash of various different kinds of substances? STEIN: Well, now that's the situation now. It's really a mishmash. If you go around the country, from state to state, there have been different states using different formulas. Some states are only using one drug, some states are using two drugs, some are using three. And the mix of those drugs varies from state to state. And some of these drugs had never been used before. And that's why we're starting to see all these problems emerge. SIEGEL: What about the role of doctors in all this? In Oklahoma, there's some question about whether the drug was administered properly, and it was a doctor taking part in this. Who actually carries out executions? STEIN: Yeah, that's a really interesting issue and it's extremely controversial. You know, all the major medical organizations, like the American Medical Association, have very clear guidelines about this. And they say that doctors should not participate in executions, that it's unethical. Nevertheless, it's clear that in some cases doctors are involved but in most cases we don't know who they are and we don't really know what role they're playing. Sometimes they might be there just to sign a death certificate after pronouncing the inmate dead. In other cases, they may actually be administering the drugs. We really don't know. But in some cases, there may not be a doctor to actually administering a drug. It may be a prison work or a prison official who doesn't have a lot of training, and that could cause its own problems. SIEGEL: States can use different protocols because there's no national standard here, is that right? STEIN: That's right. It's left up to each individual state and they decide for themselves how to do it. And some state - and that's another issue of transparency. In some cases, state law makes it clear that they have to make all the information public and they have to go through a public comment period if they're going to change their protocol. In other states, it's just left up to the corrections department to do what they want, and they don't necessarily have to provide all the details about what drugs they're using, what doses, where they're getting their drugs. SIEGEL: And I gather there's one odd pointer: a lot of the people being executed may be drug addicts or former drug addicts, that may complicate finding a vein. STEIN: Yes, exactly. So, if you had - one of the issues with the execution in Oklahoma was, was the IV put in the right way? Did the vein collapse for some reason? The inmate's lawyer says no, that he was not a drug addict and that shouldn't have been an issue. SIEGEL: Thank you, Rob. That's NPR health correspondent Rob Stein. ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:  And as Martin mentioned, states have been having trouble obtaining the drugs used in lethal injections. Joining us now to explain what's been happening is NPR's health correspondent Rob Stein. And, Rob, what are these drugs exactly and how do they work? ROB STEIN, BYLINE: Yeah, Robert. You know, for years, there was a standard way to execute someone in the United States by injecting them with drugs. And this was a three-drug cocktail that the Supreme Court had ruled was constitutional. Now, here's how it worked. The first drug was called sodium thiopental, and that basically knocked the person out, it made them unconscious. The second drug is called pancuronium bromide, and that basically would paralyze the inmate so they couldn't move. And then finally they would administer a drug called potassium chloride. That's a toxin that would stop their heart. And that's the drug that would kill them. Now, this cocktail was actually, coincidentally, created by a medical examiner in Oklahoma - same state - in 1977. I've spoken to Dr. Jay Chapman several times over the years as controversy has arisen over this cocktail. SIEGEL: Yeah, the controversy began after states started having difficulties getting those drugs in recent years. Remind us again of what happened. STEIN: This is actually part of a broader problem that we've been having in this country where there's been shortages of lots of different drugs and there's been a variety of factors that have contributed to that. One of them is the consolidation in the pharmaceutical industry. So, there are fewer and fewer companies making a lot of these drugs and sometimes only one or two. And when it hit the lethal injection issue because when a company that is based in Italy, actually, decided that it no longer wanted to ship the first drug, sodium thiopenthal, to the United States because of objections to the death penalty in the United States. And that started companies, states scrambling to find other sources of drugs. Then a Danish company stopped shipping another drug that had been used to replace that drug. And then the EU banned distributing these drugs to the United States. States started looking to other countries, like Britain and Germany, and that ran into problems with other government agencies, like the Food and Drug Administration and the Drug Enforcement Agency. And then finally, they ended up turning to these compounding pharmacies, which are small pharmacies that mix small batches of drugs. SIEGEL: Rob, which are still making the three drugs or a mishmash of various different kinds of substances? STEIN: Well, now that's the situation now. It's really a mishmash. If you go around the country, from state to state, there have been different states using different formulas. Some states are only using one drug, some states are using two drugs, some are using three. And the mix of those drugs varies from state to state. And some of these drugs had never been used before. And that's why we're starting to see all these problems emerge. SIEGEL: What about the role of doctors in all this? In Oklahoma, there's some question about whether the drug was administered properly, and it was a doctor taking part in this. Who actually carries out executions? STEIN: Yeah, that's a really interesting issue and it's extremely controversial. You know, all the major medical organizations, like the American Medical Association, have very clear guidelines about this. And they say that doctors should not participate in executions, that it's unethical. Nevertheless, it's clear that in some cases doctors are involved but in most cases we don't know who they are and we don't really know what role they're playing. Sometimes they might be there just to sign a death certificate after pronouncing the inmate dead. In other cases, they may actually be administering the drugs. We really don't know. But in some cases, there may not be a doctor to actually administering a drug. It may be a prison work or a prison official who doesn't have a lot of training, and that could cause its own problems. SIEGEL: States can use different protocols because there's no national standard here, is that right? STEIN: That's right. It's left up to each individual state and they decide for themselves how to do it. And some state - and that's another issue of transparency. In some cases, state law makes it clear that they have to make all the information public and they have to go through a public comment period if they're going to change their protocol. In other states, it's just left up to the corrections department to do what they want, and they don't necessarily have to provide all the details about what drugs they're using, what doses, where they're getting their drugs. SIEGEL: And I gather there's one odd pointer: a lot of the people being executed may be drug addicts or former drug addicts, that may complicate finding a vein. STEIN: Yes, exactly.

I'm Arun Rath. The economy has been struggling for so long, the release of the government's monthly jobs report has turned into a somber ritual. But April's report which came out yesterday brought good news. (SOUNDBITE OF NEWS BROADCASTS)UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: OK, breaking news. The jobs numbers are a big story this morning. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: 288,000 jobs created. . . UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #3: The unemployment rate drops down to 6. 3 percent. RATH: Now, if you look out your window, you're not likely to see people dancing in the streets. Unemployment fell so sharply in part because 800,000 people dropped out of the labor force. Employers say there are still some jobs out there and they're having a hard time filling them because the workers lack essential skills. And that's our cover story today - bridging the skills gap. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RATH: Of course, behind all those government statistics there are real people, like Ricardo Corros. He's been a truck driver for years but for him the golden ticket would be working in an oil refinery. That shouldn't be a problem. There are seven oil refineries operating right here in the L. A. area,. But it's not so simple. RICARDO CORROS: I didn't know how to get into a refinery. I heard it takes three years to get into a refinery itself. I didn't know the first step. There's online applications you can do but out of all the emails I don't think people are going to call you back unless you know somebody; a cousin or uncle, and I don't. RATH: We'll get back to Ricardo in a bit but first, more on the skills gap and his potential employers. The easiest time to get hired at a refinery is during what's called a turnaround. That's when they have to shut down for routine maintenance. Now every second a refinery is shut down, money flies out the window. So companies want to do the turnaround as fast as possible. That requires hiring hundreds of people. But those workers require specific skills and need to hit the ground running. Here's Steve Martinez. He has to hire people to staff these turnarounds. STEVE MARTINEZ: They need to have specialized training, particularly in safety protocols. And in the course of a lot of general population particularly looking for blue-collar work are not going to have those requisite skills. RATH: Martinez is in charge of west coast hiring for a company called Veolia. Refineries hire his company to help with these turnarounds. He's mostly looking for what are called middle-skill positions, jobs like safety attendants, who watch to make sure everything is running smoothly and safely; hydro blasters, those are workers who clean out the inside of oil tanks. And special onsite truck drivers. All of these positions pay about $14 or $16 an hour and require special training and credentials. The jobs are grueling. And although Veolia has a good safety record, they're a lot more dangerous than working at Starbucks or a Target. But the economy has been so bad that every time companies in the region would post a job, they'd get hundreds, even a thousand applications. And even still they were having trouble. Here's Martinez again. : We have recruited in the past from all sectors of the job market. And we've seen a lot of candidates coming from different industries. But we still suffered with folks that were lacking some basic skills that we assumed, you know, the general population had a grasp on. We have found, you know, probably more cases than not that some of the employees that we've had lacked a certain level of computer skills. Reading skills were low and retention skills were low. RATH: That right there is the skills gap. The Workforce Investment Act and other government programs are supposed to fill in that gap by helping to train workers, but often they don't work. A report from the Government Accountability Office back in December found that a full 80 percent of job training centers reported employers approaching them for help filling positions but leaving empty handed. That's exactly what Steve Martinez was seeing for years. : Because we weren't finding the right candidates to fill these positions, we were importing them from other parts of the country, you know, from our other locations like in the Gulf of Mexico, in the Texas area. We'll import them, we'll house them. You know, we'll pay per diem for them. That gets expensive. RATH: The Chevron refinery in El Segundo has a big turnaround coming up, but now they're looking for workers closer to home. Just outside of L. A. , I joined a couple dozen people who were training to be safety attendants during that Chevron turnaround and others going on this year. It's a group of men mostly, although I do see one woman among the trainees. They gather in clusters around three hands-on stations. KEN ACKBAR: Give me the basic PPE to require to have on as a safety attendant, a hard hat. . . RATH: That's Ken Ackbar. He's drilling one of the trainees on the necessary PPE, that's personal protective equipment. TRAINER: OK. And a full gas meter? OK. And a reflective vest or a fluorescent vest because of high visibility, right? RATH: Ken Ackbar is pointing now to a row of fire extinguishers. And beyond that, a big dark platform that contains a pool of liquid with a metal structure in the center. TRAINER: What I want you to do is take that fire extinguisher and get over there. You're going to do a visual inspection of it and make sure your equipment is good. And then once you're comfortable that it is good, you're going to walk over and position yourself strategically where you think it is best where you need to be to put this fire out. And when you're ready, just say ready and then I'm going to light it for you. RATH: The instructor flips a switch and a fire flares out from the center of the platform. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Fire, fire. RATH: The trainee takes a confident stance near the fire, not too near, and douses it with the extinguisher. He has it put out in about 10 seconds. JASON VOGEL: Although it's entry level, it's a very important position. RATH: This is Jason Vogel. He's the architect of the safety attendant training program. VOGEL: Because if the safety attendant doesn't show up, well, then the craft workers can't work. So the welder, the carpenter, the pipefitter, all those guys can't go in unless the safety attendant is there. And they still get paid so. . . RATH: Vogel used to teach classes for the Occupational Safety and Health Administration at a nearby university. A few years ago he heard about companies like Veolia, shipping and refinery workers from the Gulf Coast and thought he could do better. He partnered up with a group called the Occupational Safety Councils of America or OSCA, and asked the refineries directly what they were looking for. VOGEL: The program was built from industry. We didn't build it and hope it met their standards. We had them build it so we knew it met their standards. RATH: Here's the other key part of the OSCA training. The program is set up under the umbrella of a California community college district. That's crucial because the district is a government-approved training provider. In other words, they receive Workforce Investment Act dollars to train people looking for jobs so those people don't have to pay out of pocket for all those classes. The government is paying to give people the training and credentials they need to get jobs the employers are desperate to fill. They're just entry level jobs at first but those credentials and training stick with them. Again, Jason Vogel. VOGEL: We make sure they understand that if you take these courses it doesn't mean you're automatically going to become the safety manager at the jobsite. But what it does is it gives you the training and the background where if you do a good job and you put your, you know, years of experience in it, it opens up opportunities for you to have a safety career. RATH: Back at the training, it's that prospect of a career that has the trainees excited. One of them is Ricardo Corros. You remember him from earlier. CORROS: I didn't know how to get into a refinery. I didn't know the first step. RATH: Ricardo started working as a truck driver after leaving the Army in 2004. It's frustrating, he says, not much of a career ladder. It was when he was shuttling oil and waste between the refineries and the harbor that it struck him. The refinery workers had what he wanted. CORROS: A lot of them worked four on four off, 12 hours a day, hard work but good money. And it seemed like something I'd like to do for the rest of my life. RATH: So would you have had a shot, do you think, if not for this program, not for this. . . CORROS: Not really, with no experience. No, I don't think so. RATH: One of his classmates here today Soynika Brown-Johnson has already gone out and paid for one of those necessary credentials, but she still can't find steady work either. And she tells me she can't afford to pay for any additional training. SOYNIKA BROWN-JOHNSON: It costs. The classes that I have taken already, they've cost me out of my pocket, either traveling to another state to take the classes or either I had to - I went to Dominguez and I actually had to pay $750. So that's - this is a big difference when you can take the classes for free compared to coming out your pockets to pay for it. RATH: Brown-Johnson has been underemployed for years. Now she's said to make $14 or $16 an hour working 12-hour days every day until the turnaround is over in two or three months. And she's already dreaming of a promotion to a full-time refinery safety manager, aka a red hat. BROWN-JOHNSON: A red hat is like the ultimate, it's like a supervisor of all of the safety personnel. So you go and you do audits and you make sure everybody's following the rules of the refinery. It's a nice place to be, you know, financially and, you know, just to be up there to walk around with a red hat and to know what you're doing and, you know, you're very respected. RATH: Initially her work as a safety attendant will only line up with the refinery turnarounds. So she'll have to wait to take classes in the off-season. But unlike before, she won't have to pay out of pocket for additional training. And she's more confident there will actually be work on the other side. BROWN-JOHNSON: Actually, when I was standing in line on Monday to sign up, to check in, I was like, I'm excited. Like, my heart was beating. I was just excited because I haven't did it in a while, and I enjoy myself out there. Like, it's something different. RATH: After we first talked to her, we found out Soynika Brown-Johnson got a job with Irwin, a contractor similar to Veolia. And Ricardo Corros, the guy who couldn't find a way into the refinery industry, he got a job with Veolia. If things at the refinery go according to schedule, they'll both start working on Monday. These two people and most of the others in this program have found jobs that could turn into careers. But we're talking about a relatively small number of workers in one narrow slice of a big industry in one region of one state. A Government Accountability Office study in March reported that in 2011, hundreds of thousands of people used federal funds to pay for job training. But even the GAO has no idea how many of those people have landed jobs. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RATH: This is NPR News. ARUN RATH, HOST:  It's ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR West. I'm Arun Rath.

Germany's Max Planck Society has launched a cutting-edge institute for brain science in Jupiter. It's a town in Palm Beach County best known for its ties to professional golf. NPR's Jon Hamilton reports it's all part of an effort to entice the world's top brain scientists. JON HAMILTON, BYLINE: In Germany, the nonprofit Max Planck Society is a big deal. Its scientists have won 17 Nobel Prizes since 1948. It employs thousands of people at dozens of institutes around the country. But the society's president, Peter Gruss, says his organization's future lies elsewhere. PETER GRUSS: If you want to be on top you have to be international because the best brains are not always in your country. HAMILTON: So, Max Planck is going where those brains are: Asia, Latin America, and the U. S. Gruss says the Society chose Jupiter, Florida because a new brain institute in Boston or San Diego wouldn't have much impact. GRUSS: In Florida, we could make a huge impact. We are a visible lighthouse for excellent science in Florida, we are appreciated in Florida, and we were able to recruit the best people to this institute in Florida. HAMILTON: Max Planck is getting nearly $188 million from state and local sources to help start the institute. And that sort of funding has helped attract top scientists like David Fitzpatrick. Before taking the CEO job at Max Planck, Fitzpatrick ran the Institute for Brain Sciences at Duke University. Fitzpatrick says the Institute's mission is to investigate basic questions about things like how neurons communicate and how brain circuits form. DAVID FITZPATRICK: The answers to these fundamental questions are critical for addressing a broad range of neurological and psychiatric disorders. That includes autism, schizophrenia, depression, Alzheimer's disease. I could go on and on. HAMILTON: So far, Max Planck Florida has hired about 130 people. They work in a gleaming 100,000-square-foot research facility which opened about 18 months ago. Fitzpatrick says that because the Institute has plenty of start-up funding, its scientists can take on risky projects that would be impossible for most grant-funded university researchers. He says the idea is to provide the scientists with enough resources to try out unproved but promising lines of research. FITZPATRICK: And that research, when it gets to a point where funding agencies can see the value, can see the preliminary data that demonstrates that it will yield successful results, that puts us in a really unique competitive position. HAMILTON: Max Planck isn't part of an academic institution. But Fitzpatrick says its researchers need to be part of a scientific community. So, the institute chose a spot across the street from both Florida Atlantic University and Scripps Florida, another independent nonprofit research organization. Fitzpatrick says together these institutions are creating a hub for brain science.

ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:  One of Europe's best-known research organizations is conducting a high-stakes science experiment in Florida. Germany's Max Planck Society has launched a cutting-edge institute for brain science in Jupiter. It's a town in Palm Beach County best known for its ties to professional golf. NPR's Jon Hamilton reports it's all part of an effort to entice the world's top brain scientists. JON HAMILTON, BYLINE: In Germany, the nonprofit Max Planck Society is a big deal. Its scientists have won 17 Nobel Prizes since 1948. It employs thousands of people at dozens of institutes around the country. But the society's president, Peter Gruss, says his organization's future lies elsewhere. PETER GRUSS: If you want to be on top you have to be international because the best brains are not always in your country. HAMILTON: So, Max Planck is going where those brains are: Asia, Latin America, and the U. S. Gruss says the Society chose Jupiter, Florida because a new brain institute in Boston or San Diego wouldn't have much impact. GRUSS: In Florida, we could make a huge impact. We are a visible lighthouse for excellent science in Florida, we are appreciated in Florida, and we were able to recruit the best people to this institute in Florida. HAMILTON: Max Planck is getting nearly $188 million from state and local sources to help start the institute. And that sort of funding has helped attract top scientists like David Fitzpatrick. Before taking the CEO job at Max Planck, Fitzpatrick ran the Institute for Brain Sciences at Duke University. Fitzpatrick says the Institute's mission is to investigate basic questions about things like how neurons communicate and how brain circuits form. DAVID FITZPATRICK: The answers to these fundamental questions are critical for addressing a broad range of neurological and psychiatric disorders. That includes autism, schizophrenia, depression, Alzheimer's disease. I could go on and on. HAMILTON: So far, Max Planck Florida has hired about 130 people. They work in a gleaming 100,000-square-foot research facility which opened about 18 months ago. Fitzpatrick says that because the Institute has plenty of start-up funding, its scientists can take on risky projects that would be impossible for most grant-funded university researchers. He says the idea is to provide the scientists with enough resources to try out unproved but promising lines of research. FITZPATRICK: And that research, when it gets to a point where funding agencies can see the value, can see the preliminary data that demonstrates that it will yield successful results, that puts us in a really unique competitive position. HAMILTON: Max Planck isn't part of an academic institution. But Fitzpatrick says its researchers need to be part of a scientific community. So, the institute chose a spot across the street from both Florida Atlantic University and Scripps Florida, another independent nonprofit research organization. Fitzpatrick says together these institutions are creating a hub for brain science. FITZPATRICK: We have a very strong neuroscience community here that I think you are going to be hearing about in the next few years for all the exciting things that are happening here. HAMILTON: But there are some big challenges. Dawn Johnson is the senior director of Scripps Florida. Johnson says when Scripps arrived a decade ago, research money was plentiful.

I'm Steve Inskeep. RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST:  And I'm Renee Montagne. On California's central coast in Monterey Bay, there's a lot more chatter these days. (SOUNDBITE OF BIRD CHATTER)STEVE PALUMBI: A population explosion of marine and wildlife began last summer. And it's become even more pronounced in the last few weeks. Here's what Steve Palumbi was seeing one recent morning from a spot called China Point. Right now in view are seabirds sitting on the rocks. There's seal lions basking themselves, sea lions. There's a little cormorant fishing there in the middle of a kelp forest. I don't see any whales this second, but we often see them. We'll see pods of dolphins going by. MONTAGNE: Steve Palumbi is Director of Stanford University's Hopkins Marine Station there. Below Monterey Bay is one of the largest underwater canyons in the world. It's miles deep, making it possible for everything from Orcas to anchovies to thrive and for bigger creatures like humpback whales and dolphins come pretty close to shore. Still, this new influx of species is unprecedented in recent times. Though Palumbi told us it was probably normal centuries ago. PALUMBI: More than 200 years ago the people - early westerners who came in to Monterey wrote about the incredible abundance of wildlife of every kind and every description, but then subsequently, we took the otters for their fur, we took the whales for their oil. We took the sardines for their meat and fish meal, and we sort of stripped out the wildlife of Monterey Bay. But about 80 years ago that turned around. People started caring more and more about the bay and its ecosystem, and especially over the last 30 years protections of the sea birds, and marine mammals and the fish species have really combined to allow this boom of wildlife that 200 years ago would be natural but we don't really see very much anymore. MONTAGNE: And recently I gather there's one more element that helped this boom along and that had to do with winds. PALUMBI: Yes. And so in Monterey the deep water here allows something called upwelling to happen quite a lot. So water that is very deep in the ocean is cold. It's also nutrient rich. In places like Monterey it wells up to the suface, bringing natural fertilizer in to make the ocean ecosystems bloom. Plankton blooms, the plankton feeding fish like the anchovies feed and grow hugely and then that sparks the whole ecosystem to be able to thrive. And essentially we get serial dining of the plankton and the anchovies and then the bigger fish and the seals and the whales, et cetera, all the way up the food chain. So that upwelling is actually pushed along by winds. And the last couple of weeks we've had these very, very, very strong winds that has started our upwelling season to just an amazing degree. MONTAGNE: So is this a blip? Or does this suggest something new? PALUMBI: This is not a blip. The upwelling winds we had just started our normal season. The anchovies have been here for six months or so. And what we see, Renee, here that is really kind of unique along the West Coast is a reassembling of the ecosystem that was natural. What we're used to hearing about is ecosystems being degraded and falling apart and this is one place where the reverse is happening. MONTAGNE: For you is this a question of lessons learned? PALUMBI: For me, this is a question of lessons learned about a wide variety of things, not just the marine life. The lessons learned include how important it is not only for there to be lots of biological diversity, but actually lots of economic diversity. Where I'm standing now there's three fishing boats within view. The fishing industry here is still thriving. It's still going on. There's also a big tourism industry. There's also a lot of people who just like to live here and so instead of the local economy sucking ecosystem dry, eating it as it were, instead, the local economy is really based upon the ecosystem of the bay thriving. MONTAGNE: Well, enjoy the beautiful day and thank you much for talking with us. PALUMBI: Bye-bye, Renee.

(LAUGHTER)SIEGEL: Now, did that person really find that funny because what we're going to hear about now is laughter.

Real laughter apparently has a set of unique acoustic features that fake laughs do not fully duplicate so people can often tell the difference between this. . . (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGH)SIEGEL: . . . and this. (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGH)SIEGEL: But which is which? Greg Bryant of UCLA is going to tell us. He is an evolutionary psychologist and he is co-author of this study. Welcome to the program. GREG BRYANT: Thank you. SIEGEL: I just played two laughs from your study. Let's hear the first one again. (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGH)SIEGEL: Is that a real laugh or a fake laugh? BRYANT: That, in our study, was a real laugh. SIEGEL: Real laugh. Meaning? BRYANT: Meaning that we recorded it in a conversation between two friends, as opposed to our fake laughs, which we asked people to produce on command. SIEGEL: OK. Let's hear our fake laugh again. (SOUNDBITE OF LAUGH)SIEGEL: Now, if you played those two laughs and this is, I gather, what your study was, you played them for a number of people, how commonly could people say the first one was a genuine, authentic expression of humor and the second was a fake? BRYANT: Right. So we played people both fake laughs and real laughs and when the correct answer was a real laugh, they got that correct answer over two-thirds of the time. But when they heard fake laughs, they also thought sometimes those were real so they were tricked about a third of the time. SIEGEL: So there are false positives when it comes to fake laughs. BRYANT: That's right. SIEGEL: I see. And what is it? How do you figure it is that we somehow know or so many of us know that a laugh is not genuine? BRYANT: Well, I think there are a number of acoustic features that people unconsciously pay attention to, things like higher pitch and loudness, but there also seems to be something that has to do with the breathing. In a real laugh, the proportion of breathiness to valve sound is higher. So there's more breathiness in a real laugh than there is in a fake laugh. And we believe that that has to do with the fact that laughs are produced by different vocal systems so genuine laughs are produced by an emotional vocal system that we share with other animals and fake laughs are produced by the speech system which is human specific. SIEGEL: Which is human specific. BRYANT: Right. SIEGEL: But a really good actor, you know, who could tell himself a great joke, a method actor would be able to do a convincing fake laugh, wouldn't he? BRYANT: Right. That's a great question. I think that when people are able to use something like method acting, they are producing what I would call a real laugh. So people can sort of conjure up the real thing. I actually don't like the terminology real and fake, technically, because I think all laughs are real at some level. But the question is, which vocal system is actually producing it. SIEGEL: So really, what we're distinguishing between here are fake laughs and on the one hand and real and really good fake laughs on the other hand. BRYANT: Right. Well, yeah, so there's emotional laughs. There are good fake laughs and there are bad fake laughs. SIEGEL: Laughter is not your only academic interest. You've researched many things. But is there more to do with laughs? BRYANT: Absolutely. I'm working on some studies showing that people can recognize if people laughing together know each other or not and I'm also interested in various kinds of laughs. So for example, I think that laughs generated when somebody's being tickled, those are different than polite laughs in conversation. SIEGEL: I can only imagine the experiment that's coming to test that one. BRYANT: Right. SIEGEL: Well, Professor Bryant, thank you very much for talking with us about laughs. BRYANT: Thanks for having me. SIEGEL: That's Greg Bryant. He's associate professor of communication studies at UCLA. His study appears in the journal Evolution and Human Behavior.

I'm Steve Inskeep. RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: And I'm Renee Montagne. Good morning. A botched execution in Oklahoma last week has stoked again the controversy over the procedures states use to kill inmates. Lawyers for two death row inmates scheduled to die next week in Oklahoma and Texas have asked to have those executions postponed. At the heart of the debate are the drugs being used in lethal injections and whether they work. But the reality is, executions are carried out by people, and people sometimes make mistakes. As NPR's Laura Sullivan reports, many who've had a role in executions still struggle with their involvement. LAURA SULLIVAN, BYLINE: The three-drug execution cocktail has been common going back to 1977, ever since death row inmate Gary Mark Gilmore chose death by firing squad. He was strapped to a chair at the Utah State Prison, and five officers shot him. The media circus that ensued prompted a group of lawmakers in Oklahoma to knock on the door of Dr. Jay Chapman, the state's medical examiner at the time. The lawmakers wondered if there might be a better way when it came time for their state to execute someone. DR. JAY CHAPMAN: The general opinion in the office was that we are more humane in killing animals than we are in executing people. SULLIVAN: Dr. Chapman gave his visitors' question some thought. He came up with three drugs based loosely on anesthesia procedures at the time: one drug to knock them out, one to relax or paralyze them, and then a final drug to stop their hearts. CHAPMAN: There's nothing, you know, quote-unquote, \"magical\" about that protocol. It's simply administration of an overdose of drugs with an overdose of potassium chloride to cause cardiac arrest. SULLIVAN: Many states quickly followed suit. But Chapman's protocol depended on a number of things no one in that room could have foreseen: that in the years to come, doctors and nurses skilled in the art of finding veins would no longer participate; that drug makers in Europe would refuse to allow their drugs to be used; that unregulated pharmacies would have to replicate the drugs, and prison staff would be responsible for the dosage and the administration. Chapman supports the death penalty, but he shook his head at some of the problems. CHAPMAN: In one situation that I was made aware of, the needle was inserted into the vein pointing away from the body. And I've never even known anybody that would imagine doing that sort of thing. SULLIVAN: There have been all manner of problems: inmates that wake up midway through, inmates that cry out in pain. Former prison staff say that's because putting a dog to sleep is one thing. Killing a person is something else entirely. STEVE MARTIN: This is not normal behavior for right-minded humans to engage in. SULLIVAN: Steve Martin participated in several executions in Texas in the 1980s. His job was to man the phones in case of a reprieve. He says the whole process is emotionally crippling. He remembers a couple times when the execution team couldn't get the needles inserted properly. MARTIN: Boy, it ratcheted up everything. CARROLL PICKETT: People don't realize - you just killed somebody, and they've been a part of it. It affects all of us. SULLIVAN: Carroll Pickett was the chaplain at 95 executions in Texas through the mid-'90s. He remembers one time prison staff spent 40 minutes trying to find a vein, until the inmate sat up and helped them. PICKETT: Some of them would go outside and throw up. SULLIVAN: Over time, Pickett says the staff unraveled. PICKETT: And these were some good, good men. Basically, they all left - every one of them. SULLIVAN: Pickett and Steve Martin both say the memories of every execution haunt them; Martin says one inmate, especially, who worked on an inmate program with the prison director. MARTIN: The last words he ever uttered were thanking the director. It just - it struck me that this guy's fall partner was not even given the death sentence. And here we have this person we're executing, whose last - at least articulated - thought was to give thanks to the person that was going to execute him. SULLIVAN: Corrections officials in Oklahoma say at the moment, they're anticipating that the courts will postpone next week's execution, at least until they're certain what went wrong last week.

Every year, ivory poachers kill some 22,000 African elephants. Recent casualties included a group of rare forest elephants in the Central African Republic, and longtime listeners to this program may have heard some of them. Back in 2002, we broadcast the story of a researcher with a wildlife conservation society who lived among them. More recently, the story changed. A civil war spread across the country and the researcher had to save herself, returning to the United States. Two people who worked on that 2002 story went to visit her. One is NPR's Christopher Joyce. The other is sound engineer Bill McQuay, who recorded some of the amazing sounds you're about to hear. BILL MCQUAY, BYLINE: I went to the Central African Republic when it was still peaceful. I was expecting to find an amazing new world of sound to record for NPR's Radio Expeditions program. And I did that, but I also discovered researcher Andrea Turkalo. She had dedicated more than a decade of her life to studying forest elephants, which for centuries had remained hidden within the dense canopy of the rainforest. When I heard she had to flee the CAR because of civil war there, I knew I had to track her down and find out what happened. CHRISTOPHER JOYCE, BYLINE: I was the editor of those stories in 2002. I didn't get to go to Africa, but I've never forgotten what my friend and colleague Bill told me about Andrea and her elephants. So we decided to go see her in Providence, R. I. , near where she lives. All right, we're off. MCQUAY: We're off. JOYCE: Take a right on Post Road. MCQUAY: OK. JOYCE: So what was your impression when you first rolled into the Dzanga, the camp? MCQUAY: It was hot; it was humid. (SOUNDBITE OF RAIN FALLING AND ANIMAL SOUNDS)MCQUAY: We walked through - it was then called the Elephant Swamp. . . (SOUNDBITE OF WATER SPLASHING)MCQUAY: . . . which led us to a path through the rain forest, where we ended up at the bai - this large clearing in the center of the rainforest, which was a gathering ground for elephants. (SOUNDBITE OF ELEPHANTS)JOYCE: Andrea Turkalo had this platform that she'd built to observe elephants, but I guess at a height where she was safe. MCQUAY: The platform was about 15 feet off the ground. It was large enough for a group of people to stand or sit, and observe the elephants. (SOUNDBITE OF ELEPHANTS)JOYCE: Turn left on Thayer Street. Thayer? MCQUAY: OK. Thayer. JOYCE: Do you want to try to park on Hope Street? MCQUAY: Yeah. JOYCE: Let's go find Andrea. MCQUAY: OK. JOYCE: We meet in a coffee shop. Andrea wears her dark hair pulled back in a no-nonsense bun. She's compact and direct. She's famous in the world of elephant behavior. She was one of the first people to study forest elephants. She explains they're not like elephants that live out in the savanna. ANDREA TURKALO: We didn't know anything about them in terms of their social structure, the numbers in the area, their genetics, their communication. So all that was wide open to me. I didn't go looking for this. It sort of found me. MCQUAY: Unfortunately, a year ago, civil war in the CAR eventually found her, too. She'd lived through civil strife before but this time, she told us, it was much worse. TURKALO: This time, they were able to cover most of country, and pillage and rape and kill. MCQUAY: They were the Seleka, the Muslim rebels who had overthrown the government. TURKALO: It was the 24th of March. We  heard that these people were on their way. JOYCE: As she sips her tea now, Andrea is the picture of calm. But in the chaos of the civil war, she says she feared for her life. It was just impossible to stay. TURKALO: We got in a boat. We went downriver. We were all women - five women. JOYCE: They were heading toward the Democratic Republic of Congo. Andrea said all she was able to rescue were electronic copies of her research data. After several hours, they floated by a village. TURKALO: The people on the shore, they started discharging their automatic weapons in the air. So, we heard this rat-a-tat-tat. We stopped the boat, and they were yelling at us: Everybody out! Everybody out! And I walked up to the one man in charge, and he had an AK-47. There was moonlight, and I could see he had a revolver, and he might have been drinking. So I said to myself, I'd better go into a very passive mode. JOYCE: To her relief, the men turned out to be local, and knew one of the women in the boat. The tension broke. TURKALO: We gave them a little money, and we said the Seleka are coming. And they were terrified because they had nowhere to run. We left just before 6 p. m. , and we got to the campsite in Congo at midnight. JOYCE: Andrea did go back to the bai two weeks later, but there were armed combatants roaming everywhere. She fled once more. And it was several weeks after that when she heard that poachers had invaded the bai. They shot 26 elephants, and cut out their tusks. MCQUAY: It's so painful to imagine that scene. I spent hours on that platform with Andrea, listening to those elephants. (SOUNDBITE OF ELEPHANTS)MCQUAY: She told me what they were doing, and how they were communicating with each other. (SOUNDBITE OF ELEPHANTS)TURKALO: When they get together, groups that have not seen each other for a while, they're elated. There is an emotional thing that goes on between them. They start ear-flapping and vocalizing - and the whole recognition thing. (SOUNDBITE OF ELEPHANTS)JOYCE: Now, a year later, Bill and I are a bit surprised at how stoic Andrea is about that loss. TURKALO: I can never get too emotionally attached to things there because otherwise, you set yourself up for a lot of disappointment. I mean, I've been through a lot of poaching. JOYCE: You knew these elephants. TURKALO: Well, I don't know which ones they killed, but I'm certain that I knew a few of the elephants that they killed. JOYCE: And I assume some of the elephants that Bill recorded might be among those. TURKALO: Yeah, very possible. JOYCE: Andrea would rather be back in Africa, instead of a coffee house in Rhode Island. But she knew she had to leave. She's a researcher for a non-governmental wildlife organization. She's not a warrior. TURKALO: You know, a lot of the NGOs, we just cut and run. When it gets bad, we leave. JOYCE: But now, she's part of an extraordinary operation to protect the surviving forest elephants. It's run by a band of men who are warriors, and who can deal with civil war as well as poachers. MCQUAY: We'll get to that story tomorrow. JOYCE: I'm Christopher Joyce, NPR News, with Bill McQuay.

As a result, another long and expensive wildfire season is expected. Federal fire scientists are trying to better understand the physics of how fires spread. As NPR's Kirk Siegler reports, they hope to hand this research off to fire managers who have to make quick decisions on where to deploy resources to protect property and lives. KIRK SIEGLER, BYLINE: If you're an incident commander or say a crew boss on a large wildfire, you're in charge of coordinating a lot of things at once. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: A dozen engines, three people each, a couple safety officers, taskforce leaders and (unintelligible) so you're looking at almost 200 people just in this couple mile stretch.

SIEGLER: On the frontlines fire managers have to decide where to deploy hundreds of firefighters and when, and depending on the wind and visibility whether to do it by ground or air. These are split-second decisions based on the best available data and fire behavior models, and sometimes not so technical things like a manager's prior experiences or instincts. (SOUNDBITE OF WORKFORCE)SIEGLER: The forest service, the lead federal agency for firefighting, is studying how to improve forecasting and better predict a fire's behavior. What are the exact conditions that cause a blaze to go from a small ground fire to one like this in Yosemite, crowning in the big green trees, spreading fast and threatening a lot of lives and property. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: OK, collect in three, two, one. Start. SIEGLER: At this fire research lab in Riverside, California, a team of scientists and technicians lights a pile of dead wood shavings on fire. They're resting on a shelf in a 30-foot-long, 10-foot-high wind tunnel. The shavings are meant to mimic a dry forest floor. A few feet above them are freshly picked green shrubs, the live green trees in this simulated wildfire. The lab, it smells like campfire. Turn on a little breeze through the tunnel, just like that, all that live green is suddenly up in flames. Now it's more like a bonfire, ashes falling everywhere. DAVID WEISE: OK, what we have here is actually the fire's spreading really well on the surface with about 1 or 2-foot flames. And then that elevated canopy looks to be burning with flames on the order of eight to ten feet. SIEGLER: The lead research forester here is David Weise. WEISE: Yes, even though it's green, it's really burning quite well. SIEGLER: No surprise, these are the plants that blanket the chaparral hills of Southern California and Arizona notorious for fueling some spectacular wildfires. But what Weise wants to know is, what are the precise conditions that turn this small fire into a potentially large one that would be almost impossible to control in the field? WEISE: What we're trying to do here is conduct these experiments so that we can produce models, which can be used to perhaps predict what might happen under conditions that might be outside of a manager's experience. SIEGLER: Weise says with improved models of fire behavior, that fire manager will have a better idea where to put resources to get out in front of the fire. For the past two months they've been conducting experiment after experiment here under all kinds of different wind speeds, humidity and types of fuel. Well, it turns out most of the fire behavior models in practice today are based on research conducted 40 years ago. And most of those are based on what a fire does in dead or dry fuels, like downed trees or brush and understory. Tim Sexton is a former incident commander and crew boss who's now with the National Interagency Fire Center in Idaho. TIM SEXTON: If you have very specific understanding of the live fuel moisture, that may make the difference in using a direct attack building a line immediately adjacent to the fire or in needing to back off to a ridge or some road but some distance from the fire to operate safely. SIEGLER: Sexton says research like this that could help fire managers do their jobs better has never been so important. Firefighters are encountering more dangerous blazes as the west experiences larger and more intense fires due to drought and the spread of development in to the woods. Kirk Siegler, NPR News.

They're being slaughtered by the tens of thousands for ivory. Victims include a group of rare forest elephants in the Central African Republic. A team from NPR News recorded those elephants a dozen years ago. Our story included an American scientist who was researching them. More recently, civil war drove the scientist back to the United States, but she has teamed up with former soldiers who now protect the elephants that remain. Today, NPR's Christopher Joyce and sound engineer Bill McQuay have more of her story. (SOUNDBITE OF ELEPHANTS)BILL MCQUAY, BYLINE: I found myself in a forest clearing in 2002 surrounded by insects, elephants and rainforests. (SOUNDBITE OF ELEPHANT)MCQUAY: That's where I met Andrea Turkalo. She lived and worked in a place called the Dzanga bai. Hundreds of elephants congregated there. Turkalo studied their social life. ANDREA TURKALO: It's extraordinary, because they recognize each other's voices, just like women recognize their babies' cries. To see it actually happening in front of you, that makes my day. (SOUNDBITE OF ELEPHANTS)MCQUAY: When I was in Africa, Andrea told me then she'd like to spend the rest of her life there. But last year, she fled. Civil war made it too dangerous. Weeks after she left, poachers invaded the bai and killed 26 elephants. CHRISTOPHER JOYCE, BYLINE: Andrea's now living near Providence, Rhode Island. Bill and I met her there at a cafe. She's an American, but she's not quite sure how to be one now after 22 years in the rainforest. She clearly wants to go back to the elephant bai. She's worried about the safety of the elephants she left behind. TURKALO: In a lot of ways, those elephants saved me and made me focus. For me, it's not even work. It's my life. JOYCE: And now, even though she's still in the U. S. , she's found a way to do that, by forging an unlikely alliance of conservationists and former Israeli soldiers. MCQUAY: Here's how it happened: soon after coming back to the U. S. , she met a former Israeli soldier named Nir Kalron. JOYCE: Nir had heard about the bai massacre, and about her. He sought her out. He said he might be able to protect the elephants. He was part of a security company called Maisha in Tel Aviv that specialized in wildlife protection. TURKALO: He said to me, you know, you don't have to kill poachers. His approach is interesting. MCQUAY: She encouraged him to go to the bai and told him who to talk to there. JOYCE: Nir certainly had credentials unlike any conservationist. After serving in the Israeli army, he went off for adventure in Africa. He hired himself out as a security expert to African leaders. He also dealt in weapons - legally, he told us, when we called him in Tel Aviv. NIR KALRON: God forbid, no, not a mercenary. I was never a mercenary. JOYCE: But he told us he did become disillusioned with that work and the people he did business with, like Russian arms dealers. KALRON: The awakening I had was that it's a waste of time, and we should invest time in the environment, and not in equipping and making better or stronger African armies to fight a war that doesn't exist. The war is on the ground in the national parks. JOYCE: Nir and a team of former Israeli soldiers got to the bai about two weeks after the killings. KALRON: The Bai was empty, full of carcasses and forensic evidence that we found - ammunition casings and tracks on the ground. We didn't see a single elephant. It was quiet. JOYCE: The poachers were gone. But Nir knew they could come back and kill more elephants. He hatched a plan to create a military-style reconnaissance team there, bring in communications equipment, satellite phones, solar power. He would train local people how to use these tools to warn authorities if poachers returned. MCQUAY: But first, he needed the cooperation of the rebel leader who had taken over the area, a man known as Colonel Bahit. KALRON: And I remember thinking, wow, this guy, maybe - we were not sure - but maybe had a lot of blood on his hands. But you have to be pragmatic. He's the guy in charge. What can we do? Say, hey, we're not dealing with you because you're a murderer? And we don't know, by the way. He seemed like a very kind person, sympathetic and cooperative. JOYCE: Nir's experience working with African military officers paid off. He brought food and gifts. He took his time. KALRON: We went in, met the colonel, agreed on calming the situation down, made a gentleman's agreement that the elephants will not be touched. MCQUAY: The colonel said his men had not killed the elephants. JOYCE: In fact, evidence the poachers had left behind suggested they'd come from Sudan, on the northern border. Criminal or terrorist groups are known to traffic in ivory to raise money. KALRON: What a breeding ground for terrorism the ivory trade is for these people. I found it fascinating that I was not aware of this. JOYCE: Nir did know that this could get dangerous. He'd already been in a gun-battle with poachers in the Democratic Republic of Congo. He knew poachers who were killed, park guards, as well. MCQUAY: But with the all-clear from Colonel Bahit, Nir's group went ahead. Over several trips, they quietly brought equipment to the bai and set it up. JOYCE: Team member Omer Barak says many local people bought into the plan. OMER BARAK: I realized that they really care, that the Africans care, not only the officials in different the wildlife services, but villagers. That realization made me feel less patronizing, and not think of it as a new form of conservation colonialism. MCQUAY: Now, they've even got video cameras set up that send real-time images of the bai via satellite. That really amazed me. There's no power there, and hardly any roads. JOYCE: The money to do this comes in part from the Wildlife Conservation Society, where Andrea Turkalo works, and from the World Wildlife Fund. I asked scientists at the Wildlife Fund what they thought of collaborating with a security outfit, with soldiers who'd dealt arms in Africa. They said ivory poaching is so bad now, they need people with skills that environmentalists just don't have. Andrea told us she agrees. Poachers are organized and heavily armed now. They will kill people, as well as elephants. MCQUAY: And poaching aside, places where elephants live - like the Dzanga bai, that seemed so remote 12 years ago - are now war zones, the kinds of places Nir and his team know how to negotiate. TURKALO: I think in a lot of areas we're going to have to have people with their skills dealing with these situations, you know, where they go in and they actually deal with rebels and, you know, warlords. MCQUAY: Nonetheless, Andrea's making plans to go back to the bai with Nir Kalron. There's still a civil war going on there, but this time, she'll be with people who are tackling elephant poaching in a completely new way.

For more information about the archive and audio and video from the elephant bai, go to npr. org. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:   Let's return now to the story of the mass killing of African elephants. They're being slaughtered by the tens of thousands for ivory. Victims include a group of rare forest elephants in the Central African Republic. A team from NPR News recorded those elephants a dozen years ago. Our story included an American scientist who was researching them. More recently, civil war drove the scientist back to the United States, but she has teamed up with former soldiers who now protect the elephants that remain. Today, NPR's Christopher Joyce and sound engineer Bill McQuay have more of her story. (SOUNDBITE OF ELEPHANTS) BILL MCQUAY, BYLINE: I found myself in a forest clearing in 2002 surrounded by insects, elephants and rainforests. (SOUNDBITE OF ELEPHANT) MCQUAY: That's where I met Andrea Turkalo. She lived and worked in a place called the Dzanga bai. Hundreds of elephants congregated there. Turkalo studied their social life. ANDREA TURKALO: It's extraordinary, because they recognize each other's voices, just like women recognize their babies' cries. To see it actually happening in front of you, that makes my day. (SOUNDBITE OF ELEPHANTS) MCQUAY: When I was in Africa, Andrea told me then she'd like to spend the rest of her life there. But last year, she fled. Civil war made it too dangerous. Weeks after she left, poachers invaded the bai and killed 26 elephants. CHRISTOPHER JOYCE, BYLINE: Andrea's now living near Providence, Rhode Island. Bill and I met her there at a cafe. She's an American, but she's not quite sure how to be one now after 22 years in the rainforest. She clearly wants to go back to the elephant bai. She's worried about the safety of the elephants she left behind. TURKALO: In a lot of ways, those elephants saved me and made me focus. For me, it's not even work. It's my life. JOYCE: And now, even though she's still in the U. S. , she's found a way to do that, by forging an unlikely alliance of conservationists and former Israeli soldiers. MCQUAY: Here's how it happened: soon after coming back to the U. S. , she met a former Israeli soldier named Nir Kalron. JOYCE: Nir had heard about the bai massacre, and about her. He sought her out. He said he might be able to protect the elephants. He was part of a security company called Maisha in Tel Aviv that specialized in wildlife protection. TURKALO: He said to me, you know, you don't have to kill poachers. His approach is interesting. MCQUAY: She encouraged him to go to the bai and told him who to talk to there. JOYCE: Nir certainly had credentials unlike any conservationist. After serving in the Israeli army, he went off for adventure in Africa. He hired himself out as a security expert to African leaders. He also dealt in weapons - legally, he told us, when we called him in Tel Aviv. NIR KALRON: God forbid, no, not a mercenary. I was never a mercenary. JOYCE: But he told us he did become disillusioned with that work and the people he did business with, like Russian arms dealers. KALRON: The awakening I had was that it's a waste of time, and we should invest time in the environment, and not in equipping and making better or stronger African armies to fight a war that doesn't exist. The war is on the ground in the national parks. JOYCE: Nir and a team of former Israeli soldiers got to the bai about two weeks after the killings. KALRON: The Bai was empty, full of carcasses and forensic evidence that we found - ammunition casings and tracks on the ground. We didn't see a single elephant. It was quiet. JOYCE: The poachers were gone. But Nir knew they could come back and kill more elephants. He hatched a plan to create a military-style reconnaissance team there, bring in communications equipment, satellite phones, solar power. He would train local people how to use these tools to warn authorities if poachers returned. MCQUAY: But first, he needed the cooperation of the rebel leader who had taken over the area, a man known as Colonel Bahit. KALRON: And I remember thinking, wow, this guy, maybe - we were not sure - but maybe had a lot of blood on his hands. But you have to be pragmatic. He's the guy in charge. What can we do? Say, hey, we're not dealing with you because you're a murderer? And we don't know, by the way. He seemed like a very kind person, sympathetic and cooperative. JOYCE: Nir's experience working with African military officers paid off. He brought food and gifts. He took his time. KALRON: We went in, met the colonel, agreed on calming the situation down, made a gentleman's agreement that the elephants will not be touched. MCQUAY: The colonel said his men had not killed the elephants. JOYCE: In fact, evidence the poachers had left behind suggested they'd come from Sudan, on the northern border. Criminal or terrorist groups are known to traffic in ivory to raise money. KALRON: What a breeding ground for terrorism the ivory trade is for these people. I found it fascinating that I was not aware of this. JOYCE: Nir did know that this could get dangerous. He'd already been in a gun-battle with poachers in the Democratic Republic of Congo. He knew poachers who were killed, park guards, as well. MCQUAY: But with the all-clear from Colonel Bahit, Nir's group went ahead. Over several trips, they quietly brought equipment to the bai and set it up. JOYCE: Team member Omer Barak says many local people bought into the plan. OMER BARAK: I realized that they really care, that the Africans care, not only the officials in different the wildlife services, but villagers. That realization made me feel less patronizing, and not think of it as a new form of conservation colonialism. MCQUAY: Now, they've even got video cameras set up that send real-time images of the bai via satellite. That really amazed me. There's no power there, and hardly any roads. JOYCE: The money to do this comes in part from the Wildlife Conservation Society, where Andrea Turkalo works, and from the World Wildlife Fund. I asked scientists at the Wildlife Fund what they thought of collaborating with a security outfit, with soldiers who'd dealt arms in Africa. They said ivory poaching is so bad now, they need people with skills that environmentalists just don't have. Andrea told us she agrees. Poachers are organized and heavily armed now. They will kill people, as well as elephants. MCQUAY: And poaching aside, places where elephants live - like the Dzanga bai, that seemed so remote 12 years ago - are now war zones, the kinds of places Nir and his team know how to negotiate. TURKALO: I think in a lot of areas we're going to have to have people with their skills dealing with these situations, you know, where they go in and they actually deal with rebels and, you know, warlords. MCQUAY: Nonetheless, Andrea's making plans to go back to the bai with Nir Kalron. There's still a civil war going on there, but this time, she'll be with people who are tackling elephant poaching in a completely new way.

I'm Arun Rath. Earlier this week, just a few miles from NPR West, I found myself standing in front of a row of stainless steel medical-grade refrigerators. ANTHONY BUTCH: They probably have more urine than anybody in the world. RATH: That's Dr. Anthony Butch, director of the UCLA Olympic Analytical Laboratory. It is the biggest anti-doping lab in the world. They perform drug tests for the Olympics, the NBA, MLB, NFL, NCAA and many others. They test over 40,000 samples each year. The place is packed with millions of dollars worth of the most cutting-edge scientific gear in existence and more than 40 top level scientists to go with it. There are no signs outside to mark this amazing facility. They prefer to keep it nondescript, because they're developing the latest weapons in what many are calling a doping arms race. And that's our cover story today. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RATH: When you think of doping in sports today, it's almost impossible not to think of the U. S. Postal Service team that won so many big cycling races. From 1998 to 2001, Tyler Hamilton rode on U. S. Postal. He says that for the first two-and-a-half years of his professional career he raced clean. But one day a grueling ride in Southern Spain had taken everything out of him. Lying exhausted on his hotel bed, a team doctor offered him something. TYLER HAMILTON: Yeah, one of them came in to check on me, you know, he was concerned and sympathetic, almost fatherly, was wearing this fly-fishing vest and pulled out a little red egg-shaped capsule and there it was. You know, it was like a pill of testosterone. RATH: Hamilton swallowed it and everything changed. : Within a couple years I was up to my neck in doping. RATH: He began taking a synthetic form of a hormone that stimulates the creation of more red blood cells. More red blood cells means more oxygen in the blood, more endurance. Athletes refer to the drug by its shortened name, EPO. : Edgar Allan Poe as we called it. You were able to train harder, longer. In a race like the Tour de France, absolute game changer. RATH: Now you have to understand, this whole time he's passing doping tests but eventually the tests for EPO became more thorough. : When we heard that, the doctors came up with a new plan, blood doping. RATH: A new plan for them but an old technique. Blood doping involves athletes taking their blood or someone else's blood, storing it, then re-injecting it during an event, again providing a boost of red blood cells, great for endurance sports. Hamilton says U. S. Postal had their own blood doping doctor. Ten days into the 2000 Tour de France, they met the doctor in a hotel room. : He'd put one of those big extraction needles into your arm and fill you back up, so to speak. And typically it would be about 450 cc's of blood. RATH: Almost a half liter. During the 2004 Tour de France, Hamilton accidentally re-infused bad blood, basically giving himself blood poisoning. He had a horrendous fever and his urine turned black. But there was pressure to win and money at stake. (SOUNDBITE OF TOUR DE FRANCE RACE): You know, we won the tour in '99 with Lance. It was a huge story. I mean, it was a worldwide story. We created a monster and then it was like pressure just got bigger and bigger. RATH: It caught up with him and in 2004 he tested positive. Hamilton was suspended for two years and blacklisted from the sport. In 2010 the U. S. government opened a grand jury investigation into Armstrong and the U. S. Postal team. Witnesses were subpoenaed including Hamilton, who spent hours on the stand confessing to everything. : As soon as I started to tell the truth I realized that I'd been protecting this culture for the better part of 14 years. And I realized like that culture was no longer worth protecting. RATH: Former professional cyclist Tyler Hamilton. Back at the UCLA Olympic Analytical Lab, they're racing to keep up with the cheaters. It never stops. New samples arrive all the time. The latest shipment of boxes comes in, glass bottles of urine samples from around the world. As the boxes pass through the building, every set of hands they pass through are logged. Like police evidence, maintaining the chain of custody is essential for security. The samples get wheeled back to the lab where scientists store them in giant refrigerators. Dr. Anthony Butch pulls out one of the glass bottles ready to be entered into the system. The bottles are the extreme end of tamper proof. They can only be opened by crushing the lid, and that requires a special machine. Here they're using the latest techniques to detect drugs like EPO and practices like blood doping. Still, just as athletes like Armstrong and Hamilton were able to keep ahead of the tests for so long, Dr. Butch says it's only a matter of time before something new comes along. It can be hard to have a sense if they're winning the war or not. BUTCH: Are you an optimist or a pessimist? If you're a pessimist, you probably believe everybody's doping and nobody's getting caught because the positive rates are very, very low. If you're an optimist you think that very few people are doping and we're catching them all. Well, I'm kind of somewhere in between. I think we're catching some of them but some of them are using compounds that are escaping our ability to catch them at this particular point. RATH: He says every new drug that comes on the scene requires developing a new test, giving athletes who dope a window of opportunity. BUTCH: We're getting closer to them. As they change their doping patterns we can detect lower concentrations. I think we're picking up more cheaters. The problem is with new compounds as they come out, things that are extremely difficult to pick up, even if you have the technology. RATH: Like drugs that stimulate the athlete's own pituitary gland to produce more growth hormone. BUTCH: And these have a very, very short half-life in the order of minutes. RATH: Making the drug almost impossible to detect. The testing is out there. It's just the window of detection becomes smaller. So they're getting much more sophisticated. WARREN CORNWALL: It's a constant arms race. RATH: That's reporter Warren Cornwall. He's written a lot about the science of doping. At the level of the fan, why should we care about this? CORNWALL: If you take away restrictions on doping, essentially a sport becomes a battle between who has the best chemists and biologists to prevail. And that takes the heart out of it. I know personally for me, I mean, I'm a cyclist and a triathlete and I have videotapes of just about all the Tours de France that Armstrong won just for motivation. But I don't really watch them anymore. RATH: Cornwall has found a reason for optimism, a scientist who's developing the ultimate weapon to end the doping wars. Instead of looking for drugs like EPO in the blood, he's looking for the footprints they leave behind at the molecular level. His name is Yannis Pitsiladis, a professor of sport and exercise science at the University of Brighton. With his research supported by the world anti-doping agency, Pitsilatis looks at the evidence of doping in the genetic sequence of RNA, the partner of DNA. YANNIS PITSILADIS: It's at almost at the highest level of sensitivity because what we're looking at is the switching on and the switching off of genes as a result of taking a particular drug. We develop this profile or signature of a particular drug and then that's what we try and find. RATH: So at this genetic level there's a molecular footprint left behind? PITSILADIS: That's the idea, yes. We can find consistently in everyone we have tested up until now; we find the same molecular signature to the same drug. RATH: So how do you learn to recognize what the signature of a particular drug is at this genetic level? PITSILADIS: OK. So what we've done up until now is we've actually taken volunteers, healthy volunteers who are athletes typically who are not permitted to actually compete during the trial because obviously they would have an unfair advantage because they take a banned drug. RATH: You're having them dope. PITSILADIS: Well, I wouldn't use the word dope here because they're basically agreeing to do this, but they're taking the same kind of drug that athletes in the past and now may be taking but under controlled conditions. So we administer the drugs, so we're present when the drug is being injected. And then go into the laboratory subsequent to that and look at the genes that are being expressed. And doing that we've identified these molecular signatures of, in this particular case, the drug EPO, erythropoietin. RATH: With this test, how long are you able to trace the effects of the drugs? PITSILADIS: So far we've achieved a four-week identification, which is fabulous. The current detection window is typically 48 hours after taking an injection of EPO. Four weeks is an incredible improvement compared to what we had up until now. RATH: In terms of things that could generate false positives, are there things that you might misidentify as a signature for one of these drugs that's actually from something else? PITSILADIS: Yes. And the most important one is going to altitude, especially middle- and long-distance athletes, endurance athletes will spend a significant amount of time often living for prolonged periods of time in training at high altitude. And the changes which occur when you go to altitude, for example increase in red blood cells so you can carry more oxygen, these are the same kind of effects the drug that they tend to take also produces. So we've got to make sure that going to altitude, while it still has a similar effect on the red blood cells, isn't having the same molecular response. My prediction based on the work that we've done to date is that none of these confounders will have anywhere near the same kind of molecular signature as the particular drug of interest. RATH: You're testing with your subjects with already existing substances that we know about. Say though, in six months something else comes on the market, there is some new molecular footprint. You have to spend the time learning that new signature, right? PITSILADIS: Absolutely. Athletes that are currently doping should actually be having sleepless nights because the bottom line is those samples that you collected for anti-doping purposes are being stored. So we can go back to those samples, apply these molecular signatures as we develop them and be able to identify them even years after they've done this. So the beauty of this kind of approach, this kind of molecular signature approach is that it's almost uncheatable in the sense that there are so many genes that are being switched on that if you wanted to manipulate the test, you couldn't do it because there's far too many genes to try and manipulate. And if you ended up trying to do that you'll probably end up killing yourself. RATH: Yannis Pitsiladis, professor at the University of Brighton. Warren Cornwall says a test like this where RNA sequences could be examined months or years after the fact for previously unknown drugs could finally give authorities a decisive edge in the doping arms race. Dr. Pitsiladis says that if everything goes as planned, his test will be ready in a year-and-a-half. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)RATH: This is NPR News.

When it comes to branding, he says that companies like Coca-Cola depend on that simple human quality that we believe something is better because we are told that it is. Guy Raz, host of the TED Radio Hour had a few questions for Paul Bloom. GUY RAZ, BYLINE: How do human beings decide what's valuable and what's not? BLOOM: So you could value things for different reasons. You could value them because of their utility. You know, so golf clubs can - you play golf with them. But things get value in other ways as well. And often they get value because of their history. So the golf clubs, if they were owned by John F. Kennedy, would sell for a lot. We get pleasure sometimes from knowing what something is and knowing where it came from. And our experience is transformed in that way. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)BLOOM: Even the most seemingly simple pleasures are affected by our beliefs about hidden essences. How do you get adults to really enjoy wine? Pour it from an expensive bottle. This was recently done with a neuroscientific twist. They get people in an fMRI scanner, and while they're lying there, through a tube they get to sip wine. In front of them on a screen is information about the wine. Everybody of course drinks exactly the same wine. But if you believe you're drinking expensive stuff, parts of the brain associated with pleasure and reward light up like a Christmas tree. It's not just then you say it's more pleasurable, you say you like it more - you really experience it in a different way. RAZ: OK, so I recently had the best cup of coffee of my life. And the barista had, like, a handlebar mustache, but he's telling me about this single origin been from Maui and the name of the person who roasted it the day before and the water he pours over the grounds is. . . BLOOM: Yeah. RAZ: Like, 197 degrees. And he hands me this cup and he says, this is going to be the best cup of coffee of your life. . . BLOOM: Yeah. Yeah. RAZ: And you know what? - he was not lying. BLOOM: He was not lying, but having told you all this, it got you in the state where you were ready to appreciate it. RAZ: What if he served me Folgers crystals having told me all that? BLOOM: Right. So it's a really good question what the limits are of our expectations and beliefs. So if someone served you really awful coffee after all of that spiel, I think that we do have sense organs for a reason and we could say, boy, you know, you really oversold this, this is not that good. But we are, given all that, swayed by our beliefs. And it's not clear to me that this is irrational. In general, you could be wrong about facts about the world, it's harder to say that you're wrong about pleasure. SIMON: Psychologist Paul Bloom speaking with Guy Raz, host of the TED Radio Hour. This is NPR News. SCOTT SIMON, HOST:  Question for you - why are so many of us convinced that Coca-Cola taste better than Royal Crown or the Safeway brand? PAUL BLOOM: And it does. Perrier taste better than regular water so long as you know it's Perrier. SIMON: That's Paul Bloom, a Yale psychologist. When it comes to branding, he says that companies like Coca-Cola depend on that simple human quality that we believe something is better because we are told that it is. Guy Raz, host of the TED Radio Hour had a few questions for Paul Bloom. GUY RAZ, BYLINE: How do human beings decide what's valuable and what's not? BLOOM: So you could value things for different reasons. You could value them because of their utility. You know, so golf clubs can - you play golf with them. But things get value in other ways as well. And often they get value because of their history. So the golf clubs, if they were owned by John F. Kennedy, would sell for a lot. We get pleasure sometimes from knowing what something is and knowing where it came from. And our experience is transformed in that way.

Scientists have been studying how octopuses control all those weird appendages.

NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE, BYLINE: Scientists who study octopuses say these animals are so strange they might as well be from another planet. FRANK GRASSO: They still have the same kinds of problems that we do but with a very different body, a very different brain architecture and, therefore, in a very alien way. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Frank Grasso studies octopuses at Brooklyn College in New York. He says an octopus does not control its arms in the same way that you control your arms. GRASSO: Like if you were to be blindfolded, you know, and move your arms around, you'd have a very good idea of where your arms were. You'd have, like, a mental image. GREENFIELDBOYCE: He says octopuses don't have that mental image of every arm. Instead, the arms themselves control a lot of their own movement. They kind of have minds of their own. If you chop off an octopus arm, it will live for more than an hour. It'll grab things and latch on with its suckers. So, this raises a question: as an octopus moves through the water and the arms all brush up against each other, why don't the suckers on one arm latch onto another arm and get the octopus all tangled up? GRASSO: Three hundred suckers on eight arms that all need to be coordinated. We all said to ourselves, why hasn't anybody thought of this before? GREENFIELDBOYCE: Grasso has been working with scientists at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in Israel, who recently did some experiments with amputated octopus arms. First, they checked to see if the suckers on any given arm would stick to any other octopus arm. It turned out they wouldn't. Then the researchers took a plastic lab dish and covered it with octopus skin. They found that an arm's suckers wouldn't grab that either. But when they left part of the dish uncovered, the suckers would grab onto that part's plastic surface. All this suggested that octopus suckers are repelled by something in octopus skin. GRASSO: There seems to be a chemical detection capacity built into the rims of the suckers to recognize octopus skin and inhibit attachment. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Experiments with a crude extract from skin confirmed that. GRASSO: And it's a nice little trick that solves a problem that evolutionarily these animals have probably faced for 505 million years. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Grasso and his colleagues in Israel who did the experiments describe all this in the journal Current Biology. Nell Greenfieldboyce, NPR News.

Thanks so much for being with us. JAMES HARBECK: Hi. Nice to be here. SIMON: First, what made you devote any scholarship to this? HARBECK: I wouldn't say that this is a grand scholarly work, exactly. It's more just an application of undergraduate-level phonetics to things that I hear on the bus on the way home. SIMON: I want to ask you about a few sounds, and if you could begin by re-creating them. The first is -and I'm going to sign on to your language here - the breathy-voiced, long, low, back, unrounded vowel with advanced tongue root. HARBECK: Aghhhh! SIMON: (Laughter)HARBECK: I can't even do it without rolling my eyes. They automatically go right up to the roof. SIMON: I'm convinced. You're exasperated. All right. And that means? HARBECK: Utter exasperation, which can range from a life-threatening imposition to a request to take out the garbage five minutes sooner. SIMON: (Laughter) OK, very convincing. OK, another one - glottal fricative and breathy-voiced, mid-low, central, unrounded vowel sound, repeated. HARBECK: Heh-heh-heh-heh-heh.

HARBECK: Or somebody wishes to imply something that's a little unsavory. SIMON: Now, are these signs, Mr. Harbeck, designed to communicate or not to communicate? HARBECK: All communication is really behavior designed to cause behavior in another person. And sometimes, that behavior is a pull or a push and sometimes, it's a block.

SIMON: Yes. HARBECK: That was an alveolar click with unreleased, velar co-articulation followed by a glottal stop, reduced, mid-central, unrounded vowel - which in my case, I just about left out - and a long glottal fricative. So the click - tsk - it's just that. You know, we spell it T-S-K. And then glottal stop - the vowel, the fricative is just ahh. SIMON: (Laughter) OK. I'm sorry. What did I say?

I'M Tess Vigeland. Let us contemplate the American teenage girl, perhaps the very first one. Apparently, there's been some scientific debate about who she is and whether she hails from the same gene sequence as what we think of as the first Americans, American Indians. And when I say gene sequence, we're not talking about Skinnies from Urban Outfitters. NPR's science correspondent Joe Palca has the story of a very old American teenage identity crisis. JOE PALCA, BYLINE: A few years ago, archaeologist and paleontologist James Chatters was at a scientific meeting when a colleague showed him a picture. It was taken by divers at the bottom of a cave on the Yucatan Peninsula. The cave had flooded sometime in the last 12,000 years or so. In the picture there was a human skull. JAMES CHATTERS: I could tell from the shape of the palate and some other aspects of the skull that she was similar to the other earliest Americans I'd seen. PALCA: Along with a variety of colleagues from around the United States and Mexico, Chatters began an intensive investigation of the girl's skull and other bones. The first fruits of their labors appeared in the journal Science. They estimate the girl was 15 or 16 years old when she died and that she'd been dead for between 12 and 13,000 years. But it's the girl's DNA that proved most intriguing. That's because there's been a big debate about whether modern Native Americans are related to the very first people who came to the Americas, like the young girl, or to people who came in a more recent migration. The reason there's a question about that is the first people who came to the Americas, like this young girl, don't look very much like modern Native Americans. Chatters says modern Native Americans have narrower faces, different teeth, different palate. CHATTERS: So many differences that it seemed like they must come from somewhere else. PALCA: But the girl's DNA tells a different story. Deborah Bolnick is from the University of Texas Austin. She's an expert in extracting ancient DNA from fossilized teeth and bones. DEBORAH BOLNICK: A lot of my work is focused on trying to use genetics to help us understand more recent population history in the Americas. PALCA: Bolnick studied the girl's mitochondrial DNA, a type of DNA you inherit exclusively from your mother. What she found was the girl had a mitochondrial DNA inheritance pattern that's quite common in Native Americans alive today. So despite the differences in appearance, Bolnick says the new results suggest that modern Native Americans are indeed descended from the very first humans to reach the Americas, and not some more recent migration. By studying more of the girl's DNA, scientists are hoping to get clues about which genes were responsible for the changes in appearance. Joe Palca, NPR News.

I'm Audie Cornish. ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: And I'm Robert Siegel. \"The Big Bang Theory\" is the title of the most popular sitcom on TV right now. The idea that the universe had a fiery start is right there in the theme song. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG)SIEGEL: In real life, the Big Bang theory is a cornerstone of modern science. And that's only because of a discovery made 50 years ago today. That's when two astronomers first heard a faint signal echoing through the cosmos. It was the Big Bang's afterglow. NPR's Geoff Brumfiel spoke to duo and has this tale of a very lucky discovery. JEFF BRUMFIEL, BYLINE: The first scientist is a guy Arno Penzias. ARNO PENZIAS: I was born on April 26th, 1933 in Bavaria, which is also the birthdate of the Geheime Staatspolizei. GEOFF BRUMFIEL, BYLINE: What's that? I don't even know what that is. PENZIAS: Oh, sure you do - Gestapo. BRUMFIEL: Penzias is Jewish. He fled Nazi Germany as a child and ended studying physics at City College of New York. His collaborator was Bob Wilson. Wilson's Texan, though he's lost his accent, grew up in Houston as the son of a chemical engineer, didn't do too well in high school - almost didn't get into college at all. BOB WILSON: I barely got into Rice, perhaps because my father was an alum. BRUMFIEL: They both found their way into astronomy and met at a conference in 1962. WILSON: I was rather shy at the time. BRUMFIEL: Penzias, on the other hand, was from the Bronx. PENZIAS: Endlessly talkative. BRUMFIEL: Penzias was working at Bell Telephone Laboratories. He invited Wilson to come work with him, and Wilson agreed. WILSON: Seemed like it might be a good collaboration. I think in the end it was an excellent collaboration. PENZIAS: Oh yeah. We used to finish each other's sentences. BRUMFIEL: Well, Penzias did most of the finishing. It may seem odd that two astronomers would work at a telephone lab. But Bell Labs had something special: a state-of-the-art antenna for detecting microwaves. Yes, as in microwave ovens. But microwaves are actually a form of light. And in the 1960s, Bell Labs was trying use them to transmit long-distance phone calls. It used this super-antenna to make the first satellite phone call, from Holmdel, New Jersey out to Goldstone, California. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: Hello, Goldstone, this is Holmdel calling. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: Holmdel, this is Goldstone. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: Oh, wonderful. Well, it looks like all the hard work was really worth it. BRUMFIEL: And for Penzias and Wilson, it meant work could begin, because now that the antenna wasn't pointed at a satellite, they could use it to study microwaves coming from outer space. They wanted to study our galaxy. But when they pointed it at the edge of the Milky Way. . . (SOUNDBITE OF STATIC)BRUMFIEL: That's the original recording from May 20th, 1964 - roaring static. WILSON: The first though was we've got a problem here and we've got to find out what's wrong. PENZIAS: So, I did all sorts of things to try to find what this other source of noise could be. BRUMFIEL: There was a nearby military base. Maybe its powerful radar was causing interference. So, Penzias called them up. PENZIAS: Sergeant Jones speaking, sir. And I would say good afternoon, sergeant. Is the radar on? He said no. Who is this? And I hung up. BRUMFIEL: Another possibility? Birds. WILSON: There were a pair of pigeons living in the antenna. BRUMFIEL: Wilson and Penzias got on their lab coats, climbed inside their giant microwave contraption and wiped out the pigeon poop. The birds kept roosting in there, so Penzias made a hard decision. PENZIAS: The only humane way of doing it was to buy a box of shotgun shells. So, that's what finally happened to the pigeons. BRUMFIEL: But when they turned on the de-pigeoned antenna. . . (SOUNDBITE OF STATIC)BRUMFIEL: . . . the static was back. Penzias and Wilson spent months crossing off possible sources of interference. PENZIAS: It wasn't the radar, it wasn't the cars on the Garden State Parkway. We went through absolutely everything. BRUMFIEL: Then one day, another researcher suggested the source might not be on earth. It might not even be in the galaxy. Calculations showed years before that if the Big Bang had really happened, its afterglow would still be visible. And it would show up today as microwaves coming from all directions. The static they were getting in New Jersey came from all directions. It was everywhere. Had they just found the remains of the Big Bang? WILSON: We were a little skeptical but very pleased to have any kind of explanation for what we'd been seeing. BRUMFIEL: Others were a little more excited. CHARLES BENNETT: Well, Penzias and Wilson rocked my world. BRUMFIEL: That's Charles Bennett an astronomer at Johns Hopkins University. He was in high school when he heard about their discovery. And he's one of hundreds of scientists today who have devoted their careers to studying those microwaves. They've built satellites and set up telescopes in the remote reaches of Antarctica. It turns out that when you look closely at the microwave glow, you discover tiny variations - ripples left over from the violent swirling of the early universe. The ripples are filled with details of how it all began. BENNETT: Told us a tremendous amount about the universe, including its age - 13. 8 billion years - but also a census of what it's made of, the shape of the universe and many other aspects of the universe that we just didn't know before.

BRUMFIEL: But he considers himself lucky to have made this discovery. He and Penzias won the Nobel Prize. They went on to have full careers and happy lives. And the end of the universe is still a very long way away. Geoff Brumfiel, NPR News. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:  From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Audie Cornish. ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:  And I'm Robert Siegel. \"The Big Bang Theory\" is the title of the most popular sitcom on TV right now. The idea that the universe had a fiery start is right there in the theme song. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG) SIEGEL: In real life, the Big Bang theory is a cornerstone of modern science. And that's only because of a discovery made 50 years ago today. That's when two astronomers first heard a faint signal echoing through the cosmos. It was the Big Bang's afterglow. NPR's Geoff Brumfiel spoke to duo and has this tale of a very lucky discovery. JEFF BRUMFIEL, BYLINE: The first scientist is a guy Arno Penzias. ARNO PENZIAS: I was born on April 26th, 1933 in Bavaria, which is also the birthdate of the Geheime Staatspolizei. GEOFF BRUMFIEL, BYLINE: What's that? I don't even know what that is. PENZIAS: Oh, sure you do - Gestapo. BRUMFIEL: Penzias is Jewish. He fled Nazi Germany as a child and ended studying physics at City College of New York. His collaborator was Bob Wilson. Wilson's Texan, though he's lost his accent, grew up in Houston as the son of a chemical engineer, didn't do too well in high school - almost didn't get into college at all. BOB WILSON: I barely got into Rice, perhaps because my father was an alum. BRUMFIEL: They both found their way into astronomy and met at a conference in 1962. WILSON: I was rather shy at the time. BRUMFIEL: Penzias, on the other hand, was from the Bronx. PENZIAS: Endlessly talkative. BRUMFIEL: Penzias was working at Bell Telephone Laboratories. He invited Wilson to come work with him, and Wilson agreed. WILSON: Seemed like it might be a good collaboration. I think in the end it was an excellent collaboration. PENZIAS: Oh yeah. We used to finish each other's sentences. BRUMFIEL: Well, Penzias did most of the finishing. It may seem odd that two astronomers would work at a telephone lab. But Bell Labs had something special: a state-of-the-art antenna for detecting microwaves. Yes, as in microwave ovens. But microwaves are actually a form of light. And in the 1960s, Bell Labs was trying use them to transmit long-distance phone calls. It used this super-antenna to make the first satellite phone call, from Holmdel, New Jersey out to Goldstone, California. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: Hello, Goldstone, this is Holmdel calling. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: Holmdel, this is Goldstone. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: Oh, wonderful. Well, it looks like all the hard work was really worth it. BRUMFIEL: And for Penzias and Wilson, it meant work could begin, because now that the antenna wasn't pointed at a satellite, they could use it to study microwaves coming from outer space. They wanted to study our galaxy. But when they pointed it at the edge of the Milky Way. . . (SOUNDBITE OF STATIC) BRUMFIEL: That's the original recording from May 20th, 1964 - roaring static. WILSON: The first though was we've got a problem here and we've got to find out what's wrong. PENZIAS: So, I did all sorts of things to try to find what this other source of noise could be. BRUMFIEL: There was a nearby military base. Maybe its powerful radar was causing interference. So, Penzias called them up. PENZIAS: Sergeant Jones speaking, sir. And I would say good afternoon, sergeant. Is the radar on? He said no. Who is this? And I hung up. BRUMFIEL: Another possibility? Birds. WILSON: There were a pair of pigeons living in the antenna. BRUMFIEL: Wilson and Penzias got on their lab coats, climbed inside their giant microwave contraption and wiped out the pigeon poop. The birds kept roosting in there, so Penzias made a hard decision. PENZIAS: The only humane way of doing it was to buy a box of shotgun shells. So, that's what finally happened to the pigeons. BRUMFIEL: But when they turned on the de-pigeoned antenna. . . (SOUNDBITE OF STATIC) BRUMFIEL: . . . the static was back. Penzias and Wilson spent months crossing off possible sources of interference. PENZIAS: It wasn't the radar, it wasn't the cars on the Garden State Parkway. We went through absolutely everything. BRUMFIEL: Then one day, another researcher suggested the source might not be on earth. It might not even be in the galaxy. Calculations showed years before that if the Big Bang had really happened, its afterglow would still be visible. And it would show up today as microwaves coming from all directions. The static they were getting in New Jersey came from all directions. It was everywhere. Had they just found the remains of the Big Bang? WILSON: We were a little skeptical but very pleased to have any kind of explanation for what we'd been seeing. BRUMFIEL: Others were a little more excited. CHARLES BENNETT: Well, Penzias and Wilson rocked my world. BRUMFIEL: That's Charles Bennett an astronomer at Johns Hopkins University. He was in high school when he heard about their discovery. And he's one of hundreds of scientists today who have devoted their careers to studying those microwaves. They've built satellites and set up telescopes in the remote reaches of Antarctica. It turns out that when you look closely at the microwave glow, you discover tiny variations - ripples left over from the violent swirling of the early universe. The ripples are filled with details of how it all began. BENNETT: Told us a tremendous amount about the universe, including its age - 13. 8 billion years - but also a census of what it's made of, the shape of the universe and many other aspects of the universe that we just didn't know before. BRUMFIEL: The microwaves also showed researchers hints of what they don't know. There's some kind of unknown force out there. BENNETT: Dark energy, which sounds sort of evil, but dark energy is just a name for something that's causing the universe's expansion to actually accelerate, to go faster and faster. BRUMFIEL: Eventually, it may push everything, even atoms, apart. And for Robert Wilson, this is the dark side of his discovery 50 years ago.

Scientists say they've dug up the largest thigh bone ever found and they think they're on to a whole skeleton. But this isn't the first time that a big fossil find have led researchers to tout the largest-ever dinosaur. There was the Supersaurus found in 1972, fossils dubbed Ultrasaurus in 1983, and then there was the Seismosaurus in 1991. Brian Switek says there is reason to be cautious about the claims of this latest find.

BRIAN SWITEK: Thanks for having me. CORNISH: So tell us more about these particular bones, this newest find. I understand its in an area that's been dubbed a kind of dinosaur cemetery. SWITEK: Absolutely, what's really cool about this new site is that they've got about 150 bones from seven different individuals. So this isn't just one dinosaur that died in one spot. You have a group, perhaps a social group, perhaps a family of dinosaurs that all got buried together. So to have that much information, sort of about, you know, perhaps growth and size and maybe even behavior from the site is, you know, quite exciting. CORNISH: But given what you've said about this being an area with all kinds of, is it too early to tell whether the claims that this could potentially be the biggest creature to walk the Earth, that those are true? SWITEK: Yeah, everybody wants to have a piece of that superlative, you know, Largest Animal To Ever Work The Earth. It's a bit too early to tell, so the measurement so far, under 30 feet long and 77 tons, those are only estimates coming off of a single thighbone or femur. And that's compared to other sort of more complete dinosaurs that have been found before, sort of scaling up, to get an idea based on previous estimates. So it's kind of estimates on estimates. CORNISH: And we mentioned the Supersaurus and the Ultrasaurus, I mean what happened to these previous titleholders, these finds that were also claiming to be the largest or the longest ever? SWITEK: Many of them were knocked down. I'm happy to say that Supersaurus is still around, that one is still valid. This was a rather graceful giant, 110 feet long estimated about 45 tons. But some of these other ones, like Ultrasaurus, that turned to be parts of Supersaurus and another dinosaur that had gotten mixed together in the same quarry, so that name is discarded. CORNISH: What are we learning from this kind of research about what limits there are, in terms of how big an animal can get? SWITEK: Well, that's the really neat thing about this new dinosaur is that the competition is so close. This isn't something that would absolutely blow all the other dinosaurs away, even if it was about 130 feet long. So what this sort of size range says is the fact that we have multiple, giant dinosaur species, that are clustering around 100 foot, 50 ton or so range, might suggest that that's basically as big as it's possibly can get. That this sort of biological systems needed to support an animal that size might have been reaching their limits, in terms of the just the amount of food the animal might have been able to eat. And in terms of some physiological things, like sort of nerve conduction, that you have a neck that's 45 feet long with a certain nerve, and they call it the recurrent laryngeal nerve, that goes from the brain all the way down the neck around the aortic (unintelligible) of the heart and all the way back into the throat. So, you have 90 feet of nerve in a 45 foot long neck that needs to send signals back and forth. It might be that, you know, these dinosaurs were getting too big to basically have effective communication within their own bodies. CORNISH: In the meantime, any ideas for nickname. . . (LAUGHTER)CORNISH: . . . for this latest find? (LAUGHTER)SWITEK: It's hard to say. We've already had ultra and super and. . . CORNISH: Godzilla, will that work? SWITEK: I think that would work, yeah.

Exfoliants contain an ingredient that end up in the water. Those hygiene products include tiny bits of plastic called microbeads. New York is moving to ban microbeads for the sake of the Atlantic. Illinois is moving to ban them to protect the Great Lakes. We find NPR's Cheryl Corley at the edge of one. CHERYL CORLEY, BYLINE: I'm standing at the shoreline of North Avenue Beach, one of the many beaches in Chicago that line up along Lake Michigan. It's sunny, windy and the water looks gorgeous. JENNIFER CADDICK: Sort of a blue-emerald colored water stretching as far as the eye can see and really sort of shows the majesty and the hugeness of the Great Lakes. CORLEY: Jennifer Caddick, with the Alliance for the Great Lakes, says beneath that pristine image though, is a nearly invisible threat for the Lakes that contain more than 20 percent of the world's fresh water. CADDICK: And it was a bigger problem than we initially had thought. CORLEY: Because tiny bits of plastic are showing up in the Great Lakes. Dr. Sheri Mason, an associate chemistry professor at the State University of New York at Fredonia sailed with a research team over the last couple of years to collect data. They dragged a fine mesh net in the waters at half hour intervals to snag what they could. DR. SHERI MASON: We catch anything that's bigger than a third of a millimeter. (SOUNDBITE OF NAVY PIER MUSIC)CORLEY: When the boat docked at Chicago's noisy Navy Pier last summer, Mason  showed off the sample bottles of microbeads she and her team collected in Lake Michigan. That's very tiny. MASON: That is very tiny. CORLEY: Yeah. MASON: Yeah. And that's the stuff we pick up, so it's really, really small. CORLEY: Mason says her testing found on average17,000 bits of tiny plastic items per square kilometer in Lake Michigan. It was much lower in Lakes Huron and Superior, but Lakes Erie and Ontario had much higher concentrations. Lake Ontario at the top with counts up to one point one million plastic particles per square kilometer. Mason says while microbeads in facial cleansers and body washes may be pretty good for removing dead skin cells, here's the rub. MASON: They are about the same size as fish eggs, which means that, essentially, they look like food. To any organism that lives in the water, they are food. And so our concern is that, essentially, they are making their way into the food web. CORLEY: And if fish eat microbeads which can soak up toxins like a sponge, scientists suggest those chemicals could be passed on to humans and wildlife. So after collaborating with groups like 5 Gyres - that fight against plastic pollution in waterways, state lawmakers in Illinois and New York are among the first to approve legislation that bans microbeads. Illinois State Senator Heather Steans represents a district along Chicago's lakefront. STATE SENATOR HEATHER STEANS: Obviously, protecting the lake is hugely fundamental, not just to my district, but to the whole system of Chicago. We've got an agreed to bill now that will ban the manufacture of these by 2017 and the distribution of them in the state by 2018. CORLEY: And in New York, manufacturers would have until December of next year to phase out products with microbeads. Senator Steans says until the Illinois ban is fully approved, consumers should just look at labels. STEANS: If they have polyethylene or polypropylene on the labels, that indicates there's plastic in them. Sometimes on the front of the labels it will say microbeads as well. CORLEY: While environmental groups and lawmakers are behind the measure, so are some companies in the personal care industry. KAREN ROSS: We worked on this bill extensively, we think it's a positive first step. CORLEY: Karin Ross, a spokesperson for the Personal Care Products Council, says  L'Oreal, Johnson and Johnson and Proctor and Gamble have already announced they're phasing out the use of microbeads and are testing alternatives like sand and apricot seeds. Even so, Jared Teutsch with the Alliance for the Great Lakes says he had hoped for a quicker ban. JARED TEUTSCH: There's still urgency there and we'd like to see companies move faster than that deadline and we hope they will. CORLEY: In addition to the pending legislation in Illinois and New York, there are bills targeting microbeads in Minnesota, Ohio and California too. In the meantime, researcher, Dr. Mason, says people who have facial scrubs with little plastic beads in their medicine cabinets should try one with a different abrasive like cocoa beans. MASON: I'd much rather wash my face with chocolate than with plastic. CORLEY: Mason says banning microbeads in consumer products is an important first step but there are many more plastic products that end up in waterways and there's a long way to go to get rid of them.

Good morning. I'm Steve Inskeep. RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: And I'm Renee Montagne. When NASA issued a dire warning recently about rising sea levels, one place where it was no surprise was Hoboken, New Jersey. INSKEEP: That city sits on the Hudson River, across from New York. Ever since Hoboken was flooded by Superstorm Sandy in 2012, it's been putting together a plan defend against rising water. MONTAGNE: Mayor Dawn Zimmer serves on the president's climate change task force. She outlined for us a four-part strategy Hoboken is calling Resist, Delay, Store and Discharge. Resist involves parks that soak up rain. MAYOR DAWN ZIMMER: It would be literally building park as defense. So if we're going to build out this park, we should build it out in a way where it provides protection for the city. So that's the resist strategy. The delay: That means delaying as much as we can citywide to prevent the storm water from going down into the sewer system. In Hoboken, we have a combined sewer system, so we flood on a regular basis. So we want to retain that rainwater and use it as much as possible. And then the store strategy: We're buying land on the western side of the city creating green infrastructures, storage tanks underneath those parks, and then the drainage. So we're moving ahead with low-interest loan for a pump. And also it would drainage pipes to drain that water out as much possible. But I think it really - it is feasible, and we're committed to moving ahead with this. MONTAGNE: Though it does sound like a fair amount of infrastructure, which always says - to me, anyway - a lot of money. Where is Hoboken going to finance this? ZIMMER: Well, we are part of Rebuild by Design, which is a HUD program started under Secretary Donovan. It's a design competition, and we're very much hoping that we will be one of the teams that are selected. And this comprehensive plan could protect Weehawken, Hoboken and Northern Jersey City. And when you look at the shared assets - the Port Authority's assets, New Jersey Transit's assets, a hospital - you know, it's something where we need to turn the tide and look at really making the investment. MONTAGNE: Well, are you planning on shifting some of this cost to businesses or homeowners, homebuilders - that is, requiring green buildings, for instance, that add less stress to the systems? ZIMMER: Right, so we are already doing that. We passed a flood-prevention ordinance that says, you know, for future buildings, it has to be built with all of the utilities raised up, with the mechanicals for the elevators, for example, all raised up, so that those buildings in the future will be much more resilient going forward. As a member of the, you know, President Obama's Climate Change Task Force, I'm continuing to advocate, for example, for changes to the National Flood Insurance Program, which would make it so that, you know, we could get money towards raising up our utilities. Right now, people in the city, you know, we're paying into this system where we don't really get much out of it. So I think we need to try and really look at those federal policies. MONTAGNE: Well, I also wonder - it's now become clear that it is not if, but when sea levels will rise, and by how much. I'm wondering how you see Hoboken, your city, in a hundred years. ZIMMER: Well, I mean, that's where I'm hopeful we're going to implement this integrated strategy that is going to enable us to live with water. You know, we potentially can be a model for this. And we need to sort of - again, when you go back and look at some of the federal policies, we need to step out and stop just paying, paying, paying these repetitive losses. You know, we have an opportunity. I mean, we have an opportunity that, you know, is impossible for other species. I mean, so it really is about adapting. I'm sure that the dinosaur, if they could have predicted the Ice Age coming and observed it and developed a plan, they would have done that. But they couldn't do that. We can do this. We can adapt. And we must adapt. We see it in Hoboken. We are - and Weehawken and Jersey City. We're living with climate change right now. We've had, again, four major flood events. So that means people's cars are totaled. People's homes are still, you know, getting flooded. And we're seeing it on a regular basis, these heavy downpours. So, you know, and to a certain extent, the climate change assessment report that just came out reaffirms what I know we absolutely have to do. This is the number one priority for me, as the mayor of Hoboken, that this is the biggest challenge that our city is facing. We are living with this now, and we need to figure out a way to live with water. MONTAGNE: Mayor Zimmer, thank you very much for joining us. ZIMMER: Thank you. MONTAGNE: Dawn Zimmer is the mayor of Hoboken, New Jersey. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  It's MORNING EDITION, from NPR News. Good morning. I'm Steve Inskeep. RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST:  And I'm Renee Montagne. When NASA issued a dire warning recently about rising sea levels, one place where it was no surprise was Hoboken, New Jersey. INSKEEP: That city sits on the Hudson River, across from New York. Ever since Hoboken was flooded by Superstorm Sandy in 2012, it's been putting together a plan defend against rising water. MONTAGNE: Mayor Dawn Zimmer serves on the president's climate change task force. She outlined for us a four-part strategy Hoboken is calling Resist, Delay, Store and Discharge. Resist involves parks that soak up rain. MAYOR DAWN ZIMMER: It would be literally building park as defense. So if we're going to build out this park, we should build it out in a way where it provides protection for the city. So that's the resist strategy. The delay: That means delaying as much as we can citywide to prevent the storm water from going down into the sewer system. In Hoboken, we have a combined sewer system, so we flood on a regular basis. So we want to retain that rainwater and use it as much as possible. And then the store strategy: We're buying land on the western side of the city creating green infrastructures, storage tanks underneath those parks, and then the drainage. So we're moving ahead with low-interest loan for a pump. And also it would drainage pipes to drain that water out as much possible. But I think it really - it is feasible, and we're committed to moving ahead with this. MONTAGNE: Though it does sound like a fair amount of infrastructure, which always says - to me, anyway - a lot of money. Where is Hoboken going to finance this? ZIMMER: Well, we are part of Rebuild by Design, which is a HUD program started under Secretary Donovan. It's a design competition, and we're very much hoping that we will be one of the teams that are selected. And this comprehensive plan could protect Weehawken, Hoboken and Northern Jersey City. And when you look at the shared assets - the Port Authority's assets, New Jersey Transit's assets, a hospital - you know, it's something where we need to turn the tide and look at really making the investment. MONTAGNE: Well, are you planning on shifting some of this cost to businesses or homeowners, homebuilders - that is, requiring green buildings, for instance, that add less stress to the systems? ZIMMER: Right, so we are already doing that. We passed a flood-prevention ordinance that says, you know, for future buildings, it has to be built with all of the utilities raised up, with the mechanicals for the elevators, for example, all raised up, so that those buildings in the future will be much more resilient going forward. As a member of the, you know, President Obama's Climate Change Task Force, I'm continuing to advocate, for example, for changes to the National Flood Insurance Program, which would make it so that, you know, we could get money towards raising up our utilities. Right now, people in the city, you know, we're paying into this system where we don't really get much out of it. So I think we need to try and really look at those federal policies. MONTAGNE: Well, I also wonder - it's now become clear that it is not if, but when sea levels will rise, and by how much. I'm wondering how you see Hoboken, your city, in a hundred years.

I'm Robert Siegel. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: And I'm Audie Cornish. And this week we've been looking at the idea of memory in the age of digital photography. When we're always documenting, are we remembering more or less? Today, we're tackling memory, photography and childhood. With parents flooding their camera phones with hundreds of photos, from every angle of babies head to loose teeth, to hissy fits, to each step in the process of potty training. How will the ubiquity of photos change childhood memories? REBECCA WOOLF: I mean when my twins were born, I was taking so many photos. I think because I was like I needed proof that it was happening almost. CORNISH: Rebecca Woolf, she writes and share photos at her site Girl's Gone Child. Pull it out and you'll see oodles of photos, candid everyday life with her family of six. Ask her how many she's taken since her oldest child was born. WOOLF: Gosh, I mean, tens of thousands probably. I don't even know. CORNISH: For years, Woolf was devoted to film. Forget digital. WOOLF: I loved the mystery of getting that film back. It was magical to open up that proof sheet. The instant gratification of a digital camera is amazing but it also - you lose all of that. You feel less involved. CORNISH: And yet, once Woolf started taking digital photographs she never went back. She admits she went a little shutter crazy. And she remembers the moment when it suddenly clicked, if you will, that she was too absorbed in digital documentation. WOOLF: So I remember going to the park at one point and seeing that everyone was on their phones. And I was like, oh God, wait. Is this how people see me, as like the person - and not even that but, like, my kids? Like, are they going to think of me as somebody who was behind the camera? And I didn't want that to be the case at all. CORNISH: Woolf cuts herself some slack, reminds herself this isn't something that we grew up with. WOOLF: And I don't think any of us really know how to manage it. Or we're trying to figure it out. CORNISH: I spoke to one of the many trying to figure it out. Psychologist Maryanne Garry. MARYANNE GARRY: I think that the problem is that people are giving away being in the moment. CORNISH: They're outsourcing it to their devices. GARRY: Yeah, and then device is only the capture so much, right? And then if you outsource it to the device and then you look at what the device produces, then what have you done? You've just jettisoned it. CORNISH: Garry is a psychology professor at the Victoria University of Wellington in New Zealand. She's studied the effects of photography on our childhood memories for years. When she sees those parents at the park taking all those photos. . . GARRY: I wish they'd put the camera down and just watch what was happening. (LAUGHTER)GARRY: It's the idea that they think what they're doing is amplifying their memory. And I worry that what they're doing is just giving their memory away. So if they're paying less attention because what they've got to do is take all the photos, they're splitting their attention between what's going on and the act of taking a picture. Then they've got a thousand photos. And then they just dump the photos somewhere and don't really look at them very much, 'cause it's too difficult to tag them and organize them. That seems to me to be a kind of loss. CORNISH: Isn't it a loss for the kids? GARRY: A loss - I think it could be a loss for everybody. If parents are giving away some of their role as the archivist of the child's memory and then they're giving away some of their role as one of the key people who helps children learn how to talk about their experiences, then I mean, it could be a loss for everybody. CORNISH: Also, parents, it's usually their job to kind of build memories with kids, right? Which they will do, I guess, when they're reviewing photos is one way of doing it. If we're sort of clicking with abandon and not reviewing, are we depriving our kids of something? GARRY: Yeah, that's what I'm saying. I mean, parents carry around our memories for us when we're too little to carry them around for ourselves. And over the course of our lives, they slowly given them back to us. And if they're actually not paying enough attention because they're consumed with taking all these photographs, because they think they're documenting, then it might be that they're doing the exact opposite - which is they're not even remembering just by virtue of being someplace or watching your soccer game or at the school play. Normally when you see a parent do is sit down with a young child and say: So how was that. And, you know, even for events that just happened or events that happened long ago. You remember when we went to Disneyland, and then you had breakfast with Chip and Dale, right, and then what happened. Right, and then you remember he stole your waffle. So what you see them doing is, again, feeding the child the memory because they don't have the ability to remember it themselves. And they don't have the ability then to learn to even weave things into a storyline, you know, with a beginning, a middle, and an end - like any kind of plot. That's the kind of thing you learn from your parents. And if the parents aren't doing that, then it's going to possibly mean that children have - it takes them longer to develop that skill. CORNISH: So it's not quite the same as handing a child your phone and saying: Here, go ahead, look through the pictures. GARRY: Right, because children will know what to do with that. They need to learn to weave a storyline around their experiences. So, I mean, on one hand, you could say, well, photos provide the perfect springboard, the perfect opportunity to say: Look what happened and look what happened next, and look what happened next. But if you've got a thousand photos of something, then you're not likely to do that. Nor are you likely to wade through to find the perfect two or three photos to sit down and review them. So it would probably be better if we were a little bit more selective about the photos that we took.

I'm Audie Cornish. ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: And I'm Robert Siegel. Optimism and hurricanes are not words we usually utter together, but the Atlantic hurricane season begins June 1st, and today government forecasters offered some cautious optimism. They are expecting a relatively quiet year. Here's NPR's Jon Hamilton. JON HAMILTON, BYLINE: Officials from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration issued this year's hurricane outlook from New York City's Office of Emergency Management. It's just a mile or so from areas of lower Manhattan that were under water after Hurricane Sandy in 2012. NOAA's administrator, Kathryn Sullivan, offered a preview of 2014. KATHRYN SULLIVAN: NOAA predicts the Atlantic hurricane season in 2014 will have a range of eight to 13 tropical storms, three to six of which will become hurricanes. HAMILTON: That's fewer tropical storms and hurricanes than in an average year. But Sullivan also cautioned that predictions are about probability not certainty. SULLIVAN: Any section of our coastline can be hit by a severe tropical storm. And one storm, whatever the probabilities are, one storm can wreak tremendous havoc. HAMILTON: Sullivan has reason to be cautious about seasonal forecasts. A year ago, NOAA predicted a busy season with at least seven hurricanes. They got just two and they were small ones. Still, NOAA's May forecasts are right about two-thirds of the time. And forecasters say this year there is strong evidence that conditions in the Atlantic won't be conducive to hurricane formation. One reason is water temperature. Gerry Bell, who is in charge of NOAA's seasonal forecast, says that since 1995, hurricanes have been fueled in part by unusually warm waters in the Atlantic. GERRY BELL: This year, the Atlantic Ocean temperatures have cooled off and the computer models are indicating that we'll have a continuation of these near normal Atlantic temperatures through the season. HAMILTON: Another factor likely to discourage hurricanes is what appears to be an emerging El Nino. El Nino starts in the Pacific but ultimately, it changes the wind patterns halfway around the world, in the Atlantic. Ben Kirtman, from the University of Miami's Rosenstiel School, says El Nino produces winds with more vertical shear, meaning the strength or direction is different at higher altitudes than it is closer to the ground. BEN KIRTMAN: Hurricanes like to form where there's very little change with height in the strength of the winds. And so if there's a big change in strength with height, you just have this shearing effect that tends to reduce the number of hurricanes. HAMILTON: And if the shear is strong enough, it can actually rip them apart. Kirtman says El Nino hasn't arrived yet. But he's pretty sure it will, based on his monitoring of about 100 different forecasts from across North America. KIRTMAN: And I would say 65 or 70 percent of those 100 forecasts are calling for El Nino conditions to develop in the next two or three months. So, that's certainly good reason to have fairly high confidence that we are going to get an El Nino. HAMILTON: Kirtman says El Nino conditions do more than discourage hurricanes. They also tend to increase rainfall in the southern part of the U. S. KIRTMAN: And in fact, if this El Nino persists through the winter season like we think it's going to, there might be a little bit of a break in terms of the California drought, which has been very, very severe. HAMILTON: However, the arrival of El Nino doesn't guarantee either rainfall or protection from potentially devastating hurricanes. During an El Nino in 1992, Hurricane Andrew became a Category 5 storm that destroyed Homestead, Florida. Andrew eventually killed 65 people and caused $26 billion in damage. Jon Hamilton, NPR News.

I'm Robert Siegel. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: And I'm Audie Cornish. You may have noticed that big, flightless birds are scattered across the continents of the southern hemisphere. Africa has the ostrich, Australia has the emu and South America has the rhea. Well, scientists used to think they knew how these crazy-looking birds got to where they are today. Now, as NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce reports, they're astonished to learn just how wrong they were. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE, BYLINE: The ostrich is probably the most famous member of a group known as the ratites - primitive-looking, flightless birds. Evolutionary biologists have puzzled over them for more than a century. ALAN COOPER: And the mystery was how did they turn up on all the southern continents, and why were they so large, these great big flightless things. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Alan Cooper is director of the Australian Centre for Ancient DNA at the University of Adelaide. He says ratite birds, like the ostrich and the emu are just weird. COOPER: They don't do any of the conventional bird things. They don't fly, and they're fairly unspectacular-looking in many ways, apart from the fact they're huge. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Scientists used to think all of these large, flightless birds descended from a large, flightless ancestor that lived millions of years ago when the southern hemisphere had a giant supercontinent. That supercontinent broke up - Africa drifted away, then India and South America. Cooper says people thought that if these land masses moved. . . COOPER: The ratite birds were sitting on board and were being separated by these continents moving and that that's how they came to be where they were. And because they're flightless, it seemed like a pretty good model. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Pretty good, but also wrong - or at least that's what Cooper now thinks, because of a recent surprise discovery. He and some colleagues extracted DNA from the bones of an extinct bird called the elephant bird. It lived on the island of Madagascar until about 1,000 years ago. It looked like an ostrich, only about 30 percent bigger. It didn't fly, obviously. When Cooper's team compared its DNA to all the other birds in this flightless group, they found that its closest relative was the kiwi. COOPER: The last one I would have predicted if I had to guess that it was going to be related to would be the kiwi. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Cooper was shocked. The kiwi is a chicken-sized bird that lives in New Zealand, a place with no geographic connection to Madagascar. COOPER: And you can't have a continent or route to get from Madagascar to New Zealand. It's just completely the opposite side of the world and there's never been a close relationship between these two places. GREENFIELDBOYCE: So, how did a bird get from one place to the other? He was left with only one explanation. COOPER: It has to be flying. You can't get from Madagascar to New Zealand any other way. GREENFIELDBOYCE: He says small ancestral birds must have flown long distances, taking up residence in new places and then independently evolving into the big, flightless birds we see around the southern hemisphere today. All of this is reported in the journal Science. ALLAN BAKER: No one would ever have expected it. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Allan Baker is a researcher at the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto.

And so when other evidence comes up that points this out, you know, you have another hypothesis that you're testing and it appears to be a much better explanation of what's going on. So, I think that's fabulous. It's how science progresses. GREENFIELDBOYCE: One remaining question is why these birds around the world would all independently lose the ability to fly and get big. Cooper notes that this happened right after the extinction of the dinosaurs. Between that event and the eventual rise of mammals, there would be a time with no predators, when birds could let themselves become big and flightless, with no danger of being eaten. Nell Greenfieldboyce, NPR News. ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:  From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Robert Siegel. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:  And I'm Audie Cornish. You may have noticed that big, flightless birds are scattered across the continents of the southern hemisphere. Africa has the ostrich, Australia has the emu and South America has the rhea. Well, scientists used to think they knew how these crazy-looking birds got to where they are today. Now, as NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce reports, they're astonished to learn just how wrong they were. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE, BYLINE: The ostrich is probably the most famous member of a group known as the ratites - primitive-looking, flightless birds. Evolutionary biologists have puzzled over them for more than a century. ALAN COOPER: And the mystery was how did they turn up on all the southern continents, and why were they so large, these great big flightless things. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Alan Cooper is director of the Australian Centre for Ancient DNA at the University of Adelaide. He says ratite birds, like the ostrich and the emu are just weird. COOPER: They don't do any of the conventional bird things. They don't fly, and they're fairly unspectacular-looking in many ways, apart from the fact they're huge. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Scientists used to think all of these large, flightless birds descended from a large, flightless ancestor that lived millions of years ago when the southern hemisphere had a giant supercontinent. That supercontinent broke up - Africa drifted away, then India and South America. Cooper says people thought that if these land masses moved. . . COOPER: The ratite birds were sitting on board and were being separated by these continents moving and that that's how they came to be where they were. And because they're flightless, it seemed like a pretty good model. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Pretty good, but also wrong - or at least that's what Cooper now thinks, because of a recent surprise discovery. He and some colleagues extracted DNA from the bones of an extinct bird called the elephant bird. It lived on the island of Madagascar until about 1,000 years ago. It looked like an ostrich, only about 30 percent bigger. It didn't fly, obviously. When Cooper's team compared its DNA to all the other birds in this flightless group, they found that its closest relative was the kiwi. COOPER: The last one I would have predicted if I had to guess that it was going to be related to would be the kiwi. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Cooper was shocked. The kiwi is a chicken-sized bird that lives in New Zealand, a place with no geographic connection to Madagascar. COOPER: And you can't have a continent or route to get from Madagascar to New Zealand. It's just completely the opposite side of the world and there's never been a close relationship between these two places. GREENFIELDBOYCE: So, how did a bird get from one place to the other? He was left with only one explanation. COOPER: It has to be flying. You can't get from Madagascar to New Zealand any other way. GREENFIELDBOYCE: He says small ancestral birds must have flown long distances, taking up residence in new places and then independently evolving into the big, flightless birds we see around the southern hemisphere today. All of this is reported in the journal Science. ALLAN BAKER: No one would ever have expected it. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Allan Baker is a researcher at the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto. He used to believe that separating continents and not flying explained the history of these birds, but says this new evidence made him think again. BAKER: You can't close your mind to this. And so when other evidence comes up that points this out, you know, you have another hypothesis that you're testing and it appears to be a much better explanation of what's going on. So, I think that's fabulous. It's how science progresses. GREENFIELDBOYCE: One remaining question is why these birds around the world would all independently lose the ability to fly and get big.

I'm Guy Raz. And today on the show, we're asking this question - what's your biggest fear? Can you describe the day of a launch? Like what happens on that day? CHRIS HADFIELD: Oh, yeah. It's beyond butterflies, it's. . . RAZ: This is Chris Hatfield. He's. . . HADFIELD: . . . An astronaut - a retired astronaut. I was 21 years an astronaut. I've launched off the planet three times. RAZ: And the thing about those space launches - the odds of a catastrophic accident were 1 in 35. HADFIELD: It's like a - that feeling in a roller coaster, I think, where you get into that little chunka, chunka, chunka chain thing that drags you up the hill to make the ride begin. And the closer you get to the top, you see more and more of the world. And there's sort of this - OK, nothing bad is happening right now, but this process is leading to something. And our process is, like, 20 years that leads to - it's 20 years of chunka, chunka, chunka up the hill. And that last day is where suddenly you're - you come over that crest, and you're away. (SOUNDBITE OF LAUNCH SEQUENCE)FLIGHT COORDINATOR: This is the FC performing a launch status check at this time. All systems verify red, or it don't count. And go for launch, OTC. All. . . HADFIELD: So you wake up in quarantine somewhere where they've been preventing you from catching a head cold. There's sort of a wedding feel to it of all of these practiced and unusual places where there's a whole bunch of expectant people. And you're wearing clothes you don't normally wear. And it builds. It builds in complexity. And it definitely builds in danger until, finally, after all of the preliminaries, you are wearing the right outfit, and you're sitting in the right seat. There's an enormous amount of fuel gurgling and jostling in the tanks down underneath you in between you and the earth. And somewhere there's a spark and, bam, some unseen giant just stuck his foot in the small of your back and is now hurling you. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ENGINE)HADFIELD: . . . With a lot of vibration and very little pity. (SOUNDBITE OF ENGINE)HADFIELD: And you're along for that ride. (SOUNDBITE OF BLASTOFF)RAZ: So what's the scariest thing you've done, Chris? HADFIELD: (Laughing) The scariest thing I've done is ride a rocket ship to space. RAZ: Today on the show - what we fear - ideas about making sense out of our fears, and the possibilities we find when we actually embrace them. And over the next hour, five TED speakers who reveal the things that scare them the most, like. . . KAREN THOMPSON WALKER: . . . Just people, what people are thinking. JOE KOWAN: One of my most vivid fears is being on a plane imagining it crashing. STEPHEN CAVE: I'm scared of speaking on the phone. RAZ: Is there anything that you're afraid of right now? DAVID BLAINE: No. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"SPACE ODDITY\")DAVID BOWIE: (Singing) Ground control to Major Tom. RAZ: So in the case of Chris Hadfield, he probably never would have made it up there in the first place if he hadn't learned something about fear and really how to deal with it. Oh and if you were wondering, Chris Hadfield is, in fact, that astronaut. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"SPACE ODDITY\")HADFIELD: (Singing) This is ground control to Major Tom. You've really made the grade. RAZ: He recorded a pitch perfect cover of David Bowie's \"Space Oddity\" on the international space station. And he was just one of 200 or so people who have ever been on the space station. Chris Hadfield picks up the story from the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)HADFIELD: It's an amazing experience, but how do you deal with the danger of it and the fear that comes from it? How do you deal with fear versus danger? And having the goal in mind - thinking about where it might lead to be able to launch and go help build a space station where you are on board a million pound creation that's going around the world at five miles a second - to be able to look down the jaw-dropping gorgeousness of the turning orb like a self-propelled art gallery of fantastic constantly changing beauty that is the world itself. And you see, because of the speed, a sunrise or a sunset every 45 minutes for half a year. And the most magnificent part of all of that is to go outside on a spacewalk. You are in a one person spaceship - that is your spacesuit. And you're going through space with the world. It's an entirely different perspective. You're not looking up at the universe, you and the Earth are going through the universe together. And you are holding on with one hand, one link to the other 7 billion people. RAZ: Do you remember a time early on in your career as an astronaut where, like, the first time that you were afraid of something - not just nervous but afraid? HADFIELD: Yeah. Fear is an autonomic reaction to perceived danger. I mean if they grabbed you right now and stuck you in the cockpit of the space shuttle and said OK, we're launching in 15 minutes. RAZ: I would say stop, don't. HADFIELD: And if you - and you can't stop it, and if you touch any of the wrong switches, you kill yourself and everybody on board, then you would be, rightly, terrified. But in our case, it's the opposite. They say OK, you're preselected. You're choosing yourself, but also 15 years from now, we're going to put you in the cockpit. We're going to teach you so much about every single switch that you will know them more intimately than anything you've ever know anything in your life. And so you're so aware - it's like you're playing a harp. And I think if someone handed me a harp, and told me we were now playing in the symphony, I'd be kind of terrified, too. But if you spend the years in advance and instead it becomes more like beautiful music that you're part of and less like just a daunting, scary, petrifying thing. And the only time I really remember that happening in my career as an astronaut was watching a huge meteorite burn up in the atmosphere while I was in orbit. RAZ: Wow. HADFIELD: I was looking down at the world. I was looking at Australia at night which is nice because everybody lives on the coast. It's kind of like a necklace. But I was looking at Australia in the night by myself, and then a big meteorite came blundering into the atmosphere. And at first, my reaction was oh, look at that, a shooting star from space. And it was a big one. It took several seconds to burn out. So it was quite scenic. But then immediately after sort of marveling at the beauty of it, I recognized that that was just a dumb rock from the universe that was probably going, you know, whatever 20 miles a second that just came screaming in between me and the planet. And it could have just as easily been 100 miles higher and smacked right into the side of us - a completely random event that I couldn't have done anything about. No matter how much I trained, that would've obliterated our crew and our vehicle right away. And that - the randomness of it, the lack of the ability to do anything about it - that sent a shiver up my back of just straight animal fear. RAZ: Why you do it? I mean, why take the risk? HADFIELD: I think if you're going to take any risk in life, if you're going to expose yourself to any danger, it's worth asking why. For me, if I'm going to take a risk, I want it to be for a purpose. I want it to have a reason. And also, something that I have some control over, so that I can help be master of my own destiny and fate, at least to some degree. That's sort of the essence of exploration. RAZ: The last time Chris came back from space, it was in a Russian capsule called the Soyuz, and he was hurtling back to earth at 755 feet per second. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)HADFIELD: And in essence, you are riding a meteorite home. And riding meteorites is scary, and it ought to be. But instead of riding into the atmosphere just screaming, like you would, if suddenly you found yourself riding a meteorite right back to earth - instead, 20 years previously, we had started studying Russian. And then once you learn Russian, then we learned orbital mechanics in Russian. And then we learned vehicle control theory. And then we got into the simulator and practiced over and over and over again. And in fact, you can fly this meteorite and steer it and land in about a 15 kilometer circle anywhere on earth. So in fact, when our crew was coming back into the atmosphere inside the Soyuz, we weren't screaming, we were laughing. It was fun. So we came thundering back to earth, and then, eventually, the Russians reach in, drag you out, plunk you into a chair, and you can now look back at what was an incredible experience. You have taken the dreams of that nine-year-old boy which were impossible and dauntingly scary and figured it out to reprogram yourself - to change your primal fear so that it allowed you to come back with a set of experiences and a level of inspiration for other people that never could have been possible otherwise. RAZ: Do you think most of our fears are irrational? HADFIELD: I think fear is good. I think fear keeps you alive. You know? If a saber-toothed tiger comes bursting out of the bushes, you want to be the fastest running person around. And you want, you know, to have superhuman strength and all the rest of it. But most people, through their entire lives, respond to a perceived danger - sort of amorphous danger. And we put it behind the category of I'm afraid of - getting married, driving a race car. I'm afraid of whatever. It's easy to say. But in a modern, much more constrained world where the saber-toothed tigers very seldom come jumping out of the bushes, I should maybe try and change my caveman fear reaction to things. If I can evolve it some and, instead, experience the opportunities that exist in life, and don't let those primal fears be the main dictator of the life that results. RAZ: Astronaut Chris Hadfield, you can find his talk at ted. com(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"SPACE ODDITY\")HADFIELD: (Singing) Though I've flown one hundred thousand miles. . . RAZ: Did he ever, like, get in touch with you and say hey, you know, nice job or. . . HADFIELD: Oh, yeah. He said it was the best cover of the song ever done. RAZ: Wow. HADFIELD: Yeah, that's what I thought. RAZ: Bowie told you that? Oh my god. HADFIELD: Yeah, he sent us an e-mail. RAZ: The best cover of Bowie ever, from Bowie. HADFIELD: Well, I had a pretty good sound stage up there. RAZ: More stories and ideas about fear in a moment. I'm Guy Raz, and you're listening to the TED radio hour from NPR.

He was looking for invaders. BRAD SHEPARD: What we are doing is we're looking at the invasion front of non-native fish as they are moving up, as the climate is warming. JOYCE: The non-native fish are rainbow trout. They were introduced in the West decades ago to give anglers more fish to catch. The rainbows mostly stayed well down in the valleys - the mountain water was too cold. But over the past few decades, stream flow at higher elevations is down and water temperature is up. These conditions favor rainbow trout, so rainbows are moving upstream. When they meet the cutthroat, they mate and create a hybrid - essentially a new kind of trout. SHEPARD: And it is irreversible. Hybrids produce hybrids. JOYCE: Clint Muhlfeld is a biologist with the U. S. Geological Survey. He says there are still plenty of cutthroats, but they are all in danger of becoming hybrids. Now you might think, so what? A trout is a trout by any other name. But trout fishing brings in tens of millions of dollars just in Montana, and lots of anglers want to catch native cutthroat trout. More important, biologist like Muhlfeld worry that these hybrids might die out too, leaving fewer fish overall. CLINT MUHLFELD: Well, we started studying this, we were first finding all these hybrid trout across all these water bodies and wondering what is hybridization do to their overall performance? JOYCE: Now Muhlfeld and his colleagues have done the genetic research to answer that question. And in fact these hybrid trout don't do well at all. MUHLFELD: The hybrid offspring have greatly reduced fitness. Their ability to produce offspring and have those offspring survive. JOYCE: Muhlfeld says a change in climate triggered this phenomenon. MUHLFELD: So essentially, hybridization was a time-bomb, waiting to go off under the right environmental conditions. JOYCE: The genetic research appears in the journal Nature Climate Change. Christopher Joyce, NPR News. ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: You're listening to all things considered from NPR news. MELISSA BLOCK, HOST:  Many parts of the US have been getting warmer over the past several decades and have also been experiencing persistent drought. Wildlife often can't adjust. NPR's Christopher Joyce reports on new evidence that a changing climate maybe threatening one of the American West most highly prized fish - the cutthroat trout.

Now this shipping channel also happens to be a home of thriving coral reef. NPR's Greg Allen, recently joined a group of scientists on an urgent mission to save as many corals as they can before the excavation begins. GREG ALLEN, BYLINE: A lab just off the Miami River has become the base for an unusual lifesaving operation. COLIN FOORD: So this is a cactus coral, this is a Mycetophyllia. It's about 10 inches in diameter. It's a pretty unusual coral, one that is definitely - should not be destroyed. ALLEN: Throughout the Atlantic and Caribbean, coral reefs are protected. Even scientists aren't allowed to take coral from the wild without special permits. But in Biscayne Bay with underwater exhibition just days away, 32-year-old Colin Foord and a small group of marine researchers are racing the clock. FOORD: They're calling these corals of opportunity. Essentially corals that are living in a place that is slated to be, you know, destroyed for an infrastructure, government infrastructure project. They've basically allowed us to go in at the last minute and try to rescue all of the smaller corals that have been left behind. ALLEN: Foord's company, Coral Morphologic, researches Florida's coral reef and documents them through film and multimedia. Working under a state permit, he and other divers are transplanting the corals they save to an artificial reef a few miles away. On a small boat, Foord and three other researchers motored down the Miami River into Biscayne Bay. Slowing at one point to make way for a manatee. This is a working port, with massive freighters and cruise ships coming and going. Foord says it also turns out to be good habitat for coral. FOORD: We're finding brain coral, we're finding boulder coral, the mountainous star coral. we are finding about four or five species of corals that just this past year were proposed to be listed on the endangered species list, and they're all growing out there. ALLEN: The boat speeds past huge gantry cranes unloading container ships at the port, pass condos and sunbathers on Miami Beach, another two miles out into the bay. FOORD: We're about to come up on the edge, south side of the third reef tract. ALLEN: In the middle of the channel here on the previous day divers spotted some large corals. They've come back to rescue them. FOORD: Do you want me to first kind of put you over the spot. ALLEN: As Foord maneuvers the boat, port officials pull up in another boat to warn the crew that a freighter is coming, headed right through the spot where their diving. They are told they have 20 minutes. FOORD: OK, that's all we need. I have coral from yesterday that they had to abandon. We're just going to get the corals and we're going to get out. ALLEN: As the boat bobs in a choppy 3-foot sea, Sam May, a junior at the University of Miami, pulls on his wet suit and diving gear. SAM MAY: The depth is not what's exceptionally challenging about here, it's the fact that it's such a busy waterway. And we have to time it correctly around the currents or otherwise we have this huge 5 to 6 knot current that flows through. ALLEN: May and another diver go into the water with big baskets attached to buoys. Within a few minutes, Foord and another crew member haul in the baskets. Inside are 30-pound corals nearly two feet in diameter. FOORD: We should not be destroying corals that are that huge. ALLEN: With a freighter bearing down, Foord begins motoring the boat back to the lab. Diver Sam May says these are some of the largest corals he's handled and there are still more to be rescued. MAY: We got to the end of the dive and there's still some of the biggest ones that are still down there, which is a huge shame. ALLEN: Rough weather this week has hampered the crews' work.

And one afternoon in 1977, that happened to Richard Branson in Puerto Rico. RICHARD BRANSON: I was 27 years old. I had a beautiful lady waiting for me in the Virgin Islands. And the airline that I was flying on decided they didn't have enough passengers. So they decided to delay the flight 'til the next morn. And I was upset, desperate to get to this lady. And I went to the back of the airport. I rented a plane. I got a blackboard, just for a joke, wrote Virgin Airline's since I was going to the Virgin islands. Went out to all the passengers who'd been bumped and filled my first plane. And we ended up, you know, getting to the BBI that night. And it got me thinking. Next day I rang up Boeing and said have you got any second-hand 747s for sale? (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)CHRIS ANDERSON: You know, you made this move that other people advice you was crazy. And in fact. . . RAZ: This is TED curator Chris Anderson in conversation with Richard on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)ANDERSON: I had a conversation with one of the investment bankers who, at the time, when you - you basically sold your Virgin Records and invested heavy in Virgin Atlantic. And his view was that you were trading, you know, the world's fourth-biggest record company for the 25th biggest airline, and that you were out of your mind. Why did you do that? BRANSON: Well, I think that, you know, there's a very thin dividing line between success and failure. And I think if you start a business without financial backing, you're likely - you're likely to go the wrong side of that dividing line. And I'm - I just love learning, and I'm incredibly inquisitive. And I love taking on the - you know, the status quo and trying to turn it upside down. So I've seen life as one long learning process. And if I see, you know - you know, if I fly on somebody else's airline and find the experience is not a pleasant one, which it wasn't 21 years ago, then I think, well, you know, maybe I can create the kind of airline that I'd like to fly on. RAZ: The kind of airline that had personal video players and libraries and a standing bar 20 years before any other airline did the same thing. But aside from those things, the thing about flying is that it's not that different than it was 60 years ago. So Richard Branson plans to change that. And just like for Bertran Piccard, the seed was planted on a particular July day in 1969. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Tranquility base here. The Eagle has landed. BRANSON: It was watching the moon landing on a little black-and-white television set - and with my sisters and parents. And that was the most inspirational moment of, you know, of those years. RAZ: Did you think at that moment that we'll all someday go there. I'll go there. We'll be up there. BRANSON: Oh, I absolutely felt that. And I think, you know, millions of people all over the world assumed that one day we would be able to go to the moon. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: It's beautiful from here. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: It has a stark beauty all its own. It's like much of a (unintelligible) of the United States. BRANSON: And that was inspirational. And, you know, many, many, many years later, you know, only 300 or 400 people had actually been into space. And it was obvious that governments weren't that interested in letting us experience the wonders of space. And then we decided, you know, let's get out there and try to find an engineer or somewhere in the world who can - who could build us a spaceship. RAZ: So that's exactly what Richard Branson did. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #4: 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Release, release, release. RAZ: What you're hearing right now is actual audio from one of the first-ever test flights of SpaceShipTwo. It's a new kind of spacecraft that was built by Virgin Galactic, which is Richard's commercial spaceflight company. And it works like this. There's a giant rocket ship that blasts you and five other passengers to an altitude of 60,000 feet, at which point the smaller capsule that you're inside. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #4: 3, 2, 1. . . RAZ: . . . Detaches. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #4: Release, release, release. RAZ: And then there's another rocket blast. And then you're pressed back into your seat at 3,000 miles per hour, and you're taken thousands of feet higher into space. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #4: Bringing it down. BRANSON: When the rocket stops, you will be in space. There will be complete silence. You will unbuckle, and you will float around as gently, lift up and hit the roof. And you'll be able to turn somersaults, and you'll be able to look out of big windows that we've built back at our beautiful Earth. And you'll be 1 of only 500 people who've been to space. And you will have had, I think, the ride of a lifetime. RAZ: Richard Branson has already sold over 700 tickets for these future flights, each one costing $250,000. And once those 700 people go up, that'll be more than all the people who've ever been to space, period. How is this going to change how we travel around the world in the future? BRANSON: Well, it'll take us a while. But the 300 engineers that are working on this project are already drawing up designs for transcontinental airplanes. I mean, on purpose we built our spaceship shaped as an airplane rather than shaped as a rocket, which is the conventional way. And in that way, we can build them bigger and bigger. And one day we hope to be able to transport you orbitally, i. e. at 18,000 miles an hour from, say, New York to Australia. The maximum amount of time that people should actually spend traveling is, you know, roughly 40 minutes. . . RAZ: Wow. BRANSON: . . . Because at 18,000 miles an hour, you can get to pretty where - anywhere on earth in about 40 minutes. But equally, I think that through space travel, we may well be able to reduce the carbon footprint to a negligible carbon footprint in traveling people around the world by, you know, getting them out of the Earth's atmosphere and orbitally around the world - anyway, all Virgin flights. We'll see whether the others catches up. RAZ: So we're - I mean, so this is really, probably going to be the next big innovation in flight, right? Like, now we've got - I've seen jet travel, and the Concorde was around for a while. But it's more or less the same amount of time to get from New York to Tokyo. But the big change is going to be when you've got aircraft that will launch into space and then come back down. BRANSON: Yes. I mean, that's going to be the radical change. And then it's up to our engineers and technicians to overcome the technological challenge, then to make sure that it is environmentally safe. You know, maybe the most iconic pitch ever, which has done more, I think, for the environmental movement than almost any other picture, was the picture shot from the moon back of the earth. And I think that picture stimulated so many of us to want to, you know, protect our oceans, to protect the species in our oceans, to protect forests, to protect the species in our forests. And if we can actually get thousands of people to have that experience, I think that would be enormously beneficial to the world. That's what sort of science fiction's made of. You'll be able to just sit back and look out of your window at the earth as you're traveling around it. And it's going to be absolutely breathtaking. RAZ: That's Richard Branson. In late May, Virgin Galactic was cleared for takeoff by the FAA. Richard plans to be on that first flight to space with both of his kids later this year. He's a pretty fascinating guy.

I'm Guy Raz. And on the show today, \"Getting There,\" ideas about transport for a crowded planet. So think about where you live. And think about never going more than 25 miles from where you are right now, ever because for most of human history, that was the way it was until Henry Ford started to market the Model T to middle-class Americans. (SOUNDBITE OF FORD COMMERCIAL)BILL FORD: So what this really allowed people to do is to have freedom. It was really a societal shift. RAZ: This is Bill Ford - Henry Ford's great-grandson. FORD: My two great-grandfathers were Harvey Firestone, of the Firestone Tire and Rubber Company, and Henry Ford. And so in many ways my parents' marriage was more like a merger. RAZ: (Laughing) Yeah, right. Bill is the executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company. And he was practically bottle-fed motor oil from birth. FORD: Well, you know, I keenly remember when I was little, you know - 4, 5, 6 years old - staring out the window waiting to see what my dad was going to bring home that night. And then when he brought it home, I would leap out the front door and go through the car, probably flying from the front seat to the back seat and vice versa, checking it all out because I was really interested in it. And I remember when he brought home the first Mustang. I thought that was about the coolest thing I'd ever seen. RAZ: Was that strange? I mean, did you feel - I don't know - like, pressure to live up to that legacy? FORD: To me it was something I was exceptionally proud of, something that I knew a lot about. But I also tried not to let it burden me in any way and, rather than that, actually have it inspire me. RAZ: And the way Bill Ford wants to make his mark is by changing everything about the way we're going to drive. Here's his idea from the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)FORD: By birth and by choice, I've been involved with the auto industry my entire life. And for the past 30 years I've worked at Ford Motor Company. And for most of those years I worried about, how am I going to sell more cars and trucks? But today I worry about what if all we do is sell more cars and trucks? What happens when the number of vehicles on the road doubles, triples or even quadruples? When we look at the population growth in terms of cars, it becomes even clearer. Today there are about 800 million cars on the road worldwide. But with more people and greater prosperity around the world, that number is going to grow to between 2 and 4 billion cars by mid-century. And this is going to create the kind of global gridlock that the world has never seen before. Now, think about the impact that this is going to have on our daily lives. Today, the average American spends about a week a year stuck in traffic jams. And that's a huge waste of time and resources. But that's nothing compared to what's going on in the nations that are growing the fastest. Today, the average driver in Beijing has a five hour commute. And last summer, many of you probably saw this, there was a 100-mile traffic jam that took 11 days to clear in China. In the decades to come, 75 percent of the world's population will live in cities, and 50 of those cities will be of 10 million people or more. RAZ: So in your talk you describe this traffic problems around the world, and you mentioned Beijing. And I heard that and I thought, wow. I mean, like, a five hour commute in Beijing, on average. I mean, this is happening now. I mean, we're getting to a future where, I guess, where cities just won't be able to absorb the number of cars coming in. FORD: Yeah, it's happening. And what's happening, as a result, is a lot of municipalities are trying different kind of band-aids to ameliorate the problem. But frankly, all of those are just band-aids. And if you play that out, it becomes a human rights issue. If you can't deliver healthcare and food in major city centers because traffic simply can't move, that's a huge issue. Right now people are looking at it as an annoyance, and it is. But it could get a whole lot worse. So the option of doing nothing, to me, is not an option. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)FORD: So what's going to solve this? Well, the answer isn't going to be more of the same. My great-grandfather once said, before he invented the Model T, if I had asked people then what they wanted, they would've answered, we want faster horses. So the answer to more cars is simply not to have more roads. When America began moving west, we didn't add more wagon trains. We built railroads. Today, we need that same leap in thinking for us to create a viable future. We are going to build smart cars, but we also need to build smart roads, smart parking, smart public transportation systems and more. We need an integrated system that uses real-time data to optimize personal mobility on a massive scale without hassle or compromises for travelers. And frankly, that's the kind of system that's going to make the future of personal mobility sustainable. Now, the good news is some of this work has already begun in different parts of the world. The city of Masdar in Abu Dhabi uses driverless electric vehicles that can communicate with one another and they go underneath the city streets. And up above, you've got a series of pedestrian walkways. Now, if you look at Hong Kong, they have a very interesting system called Octopus there. It's a system that really ties together all the transportation assets into a single payment system. So parking garages, buses, trains - they all operate within the same system. These are all really good ideas that will move us forward. Now, every morning I drive about 30 miles from my home in Ann Arbor to my office in Dearborn, Michigan. And every night I go home, my commute is a total crapshoot. And I often have to leave the freeway and look for different ways for me to try and make it home. But very soon, we're going to see the days when cars are essentially talking to each other. So if the car ahead of me on I-94 hits traffic, it will immediately alert my car and tell my car to reroute itself to get me home in the best possible way. And these systems are being tested right now. And frankly, they're going to be ready for primetime pretty soon. So just imagine, one day very soon you're going to be able to plan a trip downtown, and your car will be connected to a smart parking system. So you get in your car. And as you get in your car, your car will reserve you a parking spot before you arrive. This is the kind of technology that will merge millions of individual vehicles into a single system. RAZ: You can imagine the possibilities, really, like the end of drunk driving or the end of automobile accidents, the end of traffic. FORD: Well, and think about old people who today have to give up their driver's license. RAZ: Yeah. FORD: Now we can extend their life in a vehicle and make them much more independent. And then, you know, people who are disabled - I mean, there are so many really interesting aspects to this. And that, to me, is so exciting because one of the thoughts that Henry Ford had and that really drove him was this notion of opening the highways to all mankind. Well, if you play that forward, if you do allow seniors to drive longer, if you do allow disabled people to have access to mobility, you don't have drunk driving, you, once again are opening the streets to all mankind again. RAZ: Will everything we think about driving today be completely different in 50, a hundred years? FORD: Yeah, it certainly could be. And I wouldn't put it even at a hundred years. I mean, I think, you know, we're talking, really, the next 10 to 50 years. And the reason I picked that timeframe is a lot of the autonomous driving features are going to be coming in well within the next 10 years. And then beyond that, though, it's going to take a little longer to really figure out one system that everything is connected to. That will take a little bit longer. But that's where we have to go so that every transportation element, whether it's a bike, buses, taxis, trains, subways, private cars, they're all going to have to be on a single network eventually. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)FORD: We're on our way to solving - and as I said earlier, I know we've got a long way to go - the one big issue that we're all focused on that threatens it and that's the environmental issue. But I believe we all must turn all of our effort and all of our ingenuity and determination to help now solve this notion of global gridlock because in doing so we're going to preserve what we've really come to take for granted, which is the freedom to move and move very effortlessly around the world. And frankly, we'll enhance our quality of life if we fix this because if you can envision, as I do, a future of zero emissions and freedom to move around the country and around the world like we take for granted today, that's worth the hard work today to preserve that for tomorrow. I believe we're at our best when we're confronted with big issues. This is a big one, and it won't wait. So let's get started now. Thank you.

I'm Guy Raz. And on the show today, \"Getting There,\" ideas about transportation for a crowded planet. And in the U. S. and around the world, two numbers have gotten a lot bigger in the past decade - the number of people living in cities and the number of people getting around those cities by bike. How long have you been a bike rider? JANETTE SADIK-KHAN: Oh, pretty much since I learned. RAZ: This is Janette Sadik-Khan, and she served as Michael Bloomberg's transportation commissioner in New York City. And Sometimes she bikes to work, and sometimes she doesn't. SADIK-KHAN: I do drive, and I do bike. And I do take the train, and I do take the bus. And like a lot of New Yorkers, you know, I'm really happy about the fact that in this city there are so many choices to get around town. And I think that's what people want. People want choices. It's not about one mode over the other. It's not about bikes over cars over buses over pedestrians. It's about providing the options that people need. RAZ: So if you've noticed more bike lanes or wider sidewalks, just a better flow around your city, some of that may have been inspired by what Janette did in New York. She made it easier to get around. And other cities around the world are watching. Here's how she starts her TED Talk. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SADIK-KHAN: We live in an urban age. For the first time in history, most people live in cities. And the U. N. estimates that over the next 40 years, the population is going to double on the planet. So the design of cities is a key issue for our future. Mayor Bloomberg recognized this when he launched PlaNYC in 2007. The plan recognized that cities are in a global marketplace, and that if we're going to continue to grow and thrive and to attract the million more people that are expected to move here, we need to focus on the quality of life and the efficiency of our infrastructure. For many cities, our streets have been in a kind of suspended animation for generations. Not much has changed in 50 years. RAZ: And what Janette means by that is that for the past 50 years, city streets have been designed to cater to cars and not to people. And in most cities today. . . SADIK-KHAN: You see people on the street, you know, huddled on medians and sidewalks, you know, just jostling to get around. RAZ: So when she took the job with Mayor Bloomberg, Janette started to think about how she could make the city more like it was before cars took over, when pedestrians had space to walk and shop and take a break in between. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SADIK-KHAN: When we started out, we did some early surveys about how our streets were used. And we found that New York City was largely a city without seats - you know, pictures like this - people perched on a fire hydrant, not the mark of a world-class city. So we worked hard to change that balance. And probably the best example of our new approach is in Times Square. Three hundred and fifty thousand people a day walk through Times Square. And people have tried for years to make changes. It was dangerous, hard to cross the street. It was chaotic. And so we took a different approach, a bigger approach, looked at our street differently. We closed Broadway from 42nd Street to 47th Street and created two and a half acres of new pedestrian space. And we just took paint and planters and tried it out. And lo and behold, it was a big home run. Traffic flowed better, and it was safer. And it worked better for business. It's now one of the top 10 retail locations on the planet, which certainly wasn't the case before. RAZ: So you did this with just some paint and, like, orange cones and chairs, and that was it? SADIK-KHAN: Yes, you can move fast. And, you know, a lot of people think that transportation or economic development starts with something. It's like a new building or a tech hub or new subway line. And these usually take billions of dollars to create. But I think changing your city starts with something even more basic, which is rethinking your streets. And it doesn't have to cost a lot of money. I think that's a really compelling strategy for mayors around the world. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SADIK-KHAN: We also brought this quick-acting approach to our cycling program, and, in six years, turned cycling into a real transportation option in New York. I think it's fair to say. . . (APPLAUSE)SADIK-KHAN: . . . It used to be a fairly scary place to ride a bike. And now New York has become one of the cycling capitals in the United States. And we moved quickly to create an interconnected network of 350 miles of on-street bike lanes. We also brought new designs to the street. We created the first parking-protected bike lane in the United States. (APPLAUSE)SADIK-KHAN: We protected bikers by floating parking lanes, and it's been great. Bike volumes have spiked. Injuries to all users - pedestrians, cyclists, drivers - are all down 50 percent. We've built 30 miles of these protected bike lanes, and now you're seeing them pop up all over the country. This summer we launched City Bike, the largest bike share program in the United States, with 6,000 bikes and 330 stations located next to one another. Since we've launched the program, 3 million trips have been taken. People have ridden 7 million miles. That's 280 times around the globe. And so with this little blue key, you can unlock the keys to the city and this brand-new transportation option. So looking at the different ways to make it easier for people to bike, whether it's sending them a bike infrastructure or whether it's making it possible for them to park their bike once they get there or developing a bike share system so that you didn't have to have a bike or worry about parking it when you were getting around town. RAZ: You know, like, in a place like Copenhagen - right? - I mean, I think, like, 50 percent of the people commute by bike, right? I just wonder, I mean, is that realistic for most cities? I mean, could you achieve that everywhere, or can you jut do that in a place like Copenhagen? SADIK-KHAN: No, I think that people, you know, when you build it, they will come. You know, we've seen quadrupling of bike commuting in New York City since 2000. And, you know, while that's happened, there's been no change in the number of serious bike crashes in New York. So that's a 75 percent drop in risk. And so a lot of the work goes into building that safe infrastructure. And I think, you know, you've seen biking explode. RAZ: Do you think, though, that at some point, even if bike lanes and pedestrian zones and public transit isn't as prioritized as highways and roads, that the reality is just going to change that equation - that the reality of what's happening in urban spaces is going to mean that those are the things are going to have to be prioritized? SADIK-KHAN: Yeah, I think so. And we are in a global competition, you know. Businesses and people can move anywhere. So it really - changing how your streets are designed is a matter of economic competitiveness. It's a development strategy. And when you can show that it's better for safety, it's better for business, it's better for health, you know, those kinds of strategies are going to be the kind of strategies that make a city sing and sore and compete well. So it's really like back to the future, you know? I mean, prioritizing pedestrian movement now is something that cities are looking at. Streetcars are having a huge comeback. You're seeing a lot of buses come back with bus-rapid transit and of course bikes, you know, one of the oldest modes of getting around that there is. And so making New York City with 8. 4 million people today work even better for the million that are expected to come here by 2030 means that you can't just wait for it. You can't just expect that it's going to work. You have to plan for that future. And you have to design the city you want to see. RAZ: That's Janette Sadik-Khan. She's now working with Bloomberg Associates advising other cities on how to change their streets as well. You can check out her full talk at ted. npr. org.

(SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) SADIK-KHAN: We also brought this quick-acting approach to our cycling program, and, in six years, turned cycling into a real transportation option in New York. I think it's fair to say. . . (APPLAUSE) SADIK-KHAN: . . . It used to be a fairly scary place to ride a bike. And now New York has become one of the cycling capitals in the United States. And we moved quickly to create an interconnected network of 350 miles of on-street bike lanes. We also brought new designs to the street. We created the first parking-protected bike lane in the United States. (APPLAUSE) SADIK-KHAN: We protected bikers by floating parking lanes, and it's been great. Bike volumes have spiked. Injuries to all users - pedestrians, cyclists, drivers - are all down 50 percent. We've built 30 miles of these protected bike lanes, and now you're seeing them pop up all over the country. This summer we launched City Bike, the largest bike share program in the United States, with 6,000 bikes and 330 stations located next to one another. Since we've launched the program, 3 million trips have been taken. People have ridden 7 million miles. That's 280 times around the globe. And so with this little blue key, you can unlock the keys to the city and this brand-new transportation option. So looking at the different ways to make it easier for people to bike, whether it's sending them a bike infrastructure or whether it's making it possible for them to park their bike once they get there or developing a bike share system so that you didn't have to have a bike or worry about parking it when you were getting around town. RAZ: You know, like, in a place like Copenhagen - right? - I mean, I think, like, 50 percent of the people commute by bike, right? I just wonder, I mean, is that realistic for most cities? I mean, could you achieve that everywhere, or can you jut do that in a place like Copenhagen? SADIK-KHAN: No, I think that people, you know, when you build it, they will come. You know, we've seen quadrupling of bike commuting in New York City since 2000. And, you know, while that's happened, there's been no change in the number of serious bike crashes in New York. So that's a 75 percent drop in risk. And so a lot of the work goes into building that safe infrastructure. And I think, you know, you've seen biking explode. RAZ: Do you think, though, that at some point, even if bike lanes and pedestrian zones and public transit isn't as prioritized as highways and roads, that the reality is just going to change that equation - that the reality of what's happening in urban spaces is going to mean that those are the things are going to have to be prioritized? SADIK-KHAN: Yeah, I think so. And we are in a global competition, you know. Businesses and people can move anywhere. So it really - changing how your streets are designed is a matter of economic competitiveness. It's a development strategy. And when you can show that it's better for safety, it's better for business, it's better for health, you know, those kinds of strategies are going to be the kind of strategies that make a city sing and sore and compete well. So it's really like back to the future, you know? I mean, prioritizing pedestrian movement now is something that cities are looking at. Streetcars are having a huge comeback. You're seeing a lot of buses come back with bus-rapid transit and of course bikes, you know, one of the oldest modes of getting around that there is. And so making New York City with 8. 4 million people today work even better for the million that are expected to come here by 2030 means that you can't just wait for it. You can't just expect that it's going to work. You have to plan for that future. And you have to design the city you want to see. RAZ: That's Janette Sadik-Khan. She's now working with Bloomberg Associates advising other cities on how to change their streets as well.

ROBIN CHASE: With the commissioner of transportation for London. . . RAZ: Head of a German car company. CHASE: The head of this European oil company. RAZ: And Robin who's founded several transportation companies of her own. CHASE: And this audience member asked, what is the future of cars? RAZ: Not a trivial question. CHASE: And one by one they were all, you know, saying that it was going to be a hybrid car, whether it was going to be a big car, a square car or whatever. And I was literally jumping out of my skin. And finally it was my turn. I said, no, the future of cars is shared cars. And to my huge pleasure, every single one of the other panelists turned and said, yes, she's absolutely right. The future of cars is shared cars. RAZ: Meaning at some point, many of us will stop owning cars. We'll just share them with a bunch of other people. CHASE: If we think the future's urban, there is just no way in hell it's going to be anything besides shared cars, period. RAZ: Now, there are all kinds of car-sharing services now where you rent by the hour, even by the minute. And Robin founded one of the best-known of those companies, Zipcar, which she talked about on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)CHASE: I pay only for what I need. All those hours when a car's sitting idle, I'm not paying for it. It means that I can choose a car exactly for that particular trip. I can take a BMW when I'm seeing clients. I can drive my Toyota Element when I want to go on that surfing trip. Not only do I have a fleet of cars available to me in cities around the world that I can have at my beck and call, but heaven forbid I would ever maintain or deal with the repair or have anything to do with it. I get all the good stuff and none of the bad. RAZ: So why do you think this going to be the future of driving? CHASE: You know, one of the really interesting things we discovered with Zipcar is how people change their driving habits relative to when they own a car. When you own a car in the United States, according to AAA, it's $9,000 a year. No one wants to believe that, but that's solid AAA data. And you as a car owner really are thinking that the price of this trip is really just the price of gas, right? So you think to yourself, I'd like some ice cream. And so you jump in the car and you go drive and get some ice cream. What we find when you don't own your car and when you're going to have to pay for it by the hour - that's $8 to $12 an hour depending on what kind of cars you're driving and where it is - then suddenly you're thinking, wow, $8 an hour. I'm not going to buy my ice cream that way. I'm going to, you know, stay home and eat these old cookies. And on my way home from work tomorrow I'll buy some ice cream on the way home. When you own a car and it's parked out front, you never make that decision. You get in the car every time. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)CHASE: Each Zipcar replaces 15 personal car, and each driver drives about 80 percent less because they're not paying the full cost all at once in real time. Now, a decade later, it's really time to push the envelope a little bit. And so a couple years ago, I moved to Paris with my husband and youngest child. And we launced Buzzcar. (SOUNDBITE OF BUZZCAR AD)UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: (Speaking French). CHASE: Buzzcar let's people rent out their own cars to their friends and neighbors. With Buzzcar, you independently can say I want to share a car, and I want it right in this neighborhood. And so you can share your own car with other people or you can go ask your neighbors who got a car and say hey, if you put it in this network, it's completely insured and the transaction effort has been minimized. So we as individuals can, in our own power with our own agency and our own decisions, make car sharing happen. RAZ: OK, but Buzzcar's only in France, right? So, I mean, so when you started it, were people saying, yeah, sure. You know, French people might share their cars, you know, with total strangers, but Americans will not do it. I mean, cars are like our individuality, right? I mean, they're our identity, like our freedom. CHASE: They did all tell me that. Then when I went to France, they would say to me, oh, but, Robin, you don't understand. We French people, we have a special relationship with our car. We - you know, our egos are bound up in it. And I would look at them like - and I'd roll my eyes and say I've heard that one. And can you honestly tell me that you think that Europeans have a more special relationship than Americans with their cars? CHASE: We launched. It was an exciting moment. And all the owners are adding their cars. It's really exciting. All the drivers are becoming members. It's excellent. A driver was telling me that they went to rent a car to go off the coast of France, and the owner gave it to them and said, you know what? Here's where the cliffs are and here's all the beaches. And this is my best beach, and this is where the best fish restaurant is. Peers and owners create relationships. And so on the last minute, people can - a driver can say, hey, you know what? I really need the car. Is it available. And the person will say, sure. My wife's at home. Go pick up the keys. Go do it. And it's a kind of wow - and I want to say wow-type of thing that's happening here. You have tens and hundreds and thousands of people who are creating experiments on this model. And so out of all of that influence and that effort, you are having this exceptional amount of innovation that is coming out. RAZ: You know, another thing I've noticed lately is a lot of people, like, are sharing - actually sharing rides, not just the car. CHASE: Right. RAZ: Right? Like, you go online, and you find out if somebody's going to the same place you're going to. And then you sign up and  then you're off. CHASE: Exactly. And putting humans and community into the mix makes it more humane, more fun. I really - I do think that. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)CHASE: And so when I think about the future, people will be thinking that sharing the ride with someone is this incredibly great social event out of their day. You know, how did you get to TED? You went with other TED-sters. How fabulous? Why would you ever want to go by yourself in your own car. How did you go food shopping? Well, you went with your neighbor. What a great social time. You know, it's going to really transform how we feel about travel. And it will also, I think, enhance our freedom and mobility - you know, where can I go today and who can I do it with? Those are the types of things that you will look at and feel. RAZ: All right. But I have to say, I mean, I'm listening to that and I'm thinking I need my personal space. CHASE: Yep. Yeah, yeah. RAZ: And I'm like, oh, my God, I'm going to go shopping together with my neighbor every day? CHASE: When you do the shared cars, there's almost always an etiquette going on. There's a company in France called BlaBlaCar. And they are now the largest ride-sharing company in the world. And the driver gets to indicate I'm bla, I'm bla bla, or I'm bla bla bla, so that if you wanted to be in the car where no one is talking, you would say I'm bla. Or if you are the person who doesn't stop talking, like my mom, you might be bla bla bla. RAZ: You can imagine, like, the awkwardness, though, if you go into a car and the dude's like, yeah, I'm bla. And then it's just silence for, like, four hours. CHASE: But it's not awkward. It's not awkward. RAZ: It would be weird. It's awkward. CHASE: It's just like getting on a bus. You get on the bus. You don't talk. RAZ: I mean, some people, like, hear this and say, I mean, this sounds great, Robin. But, I mean, some of this just doesn't seem realistic and maybe even a little utopian. And, you know, people like their cars, and this is just going to be a tiny little kind of niche thing. CHASE: I think they thought that in 2000 when we launched. And I think what Zipcar showed is that actually mainstream Americans find it dramatically better. And what I know today is, yeah, I was right that every single car manufacturer has a shared car, pilot or company that they're playing with - every single one. So if you live in a city and don't need a car to get to work, you are crazy to be owning one. And as we all move to cities, we should not be owning carsRAZ: Robin Chase, founder of Buzzcar and Zipcar. Check out her entire talk at ted. com. More ideas on transport for a crowded planet.

I'm Guy Raz. And on the show today, ideas about how technology and a crowded planet will change almost everything we know about getting from Point A to Point B. And our first story begins about half a century ago. BERTRAND PICCARD: (French spoken). RAZ: Was there, like, a moment when you knew that you wanted to explore the skies? PICCARD: Yes, a very precise moment. That was in July 1969. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Lift off. We have a lift off - 32 minutes past the hour. Lift off on Apollo 11. RAZ: This is Bertrand Piccard. PICCARD: I'm, at the same time, medical doctor and explorer and. . . RAZ: In July 1969, the Apollo 11 launched to the moon. Betrand Piccard was 11 years old at the time. And he was there to see it happen. And that launch, it wasn't Bertrand's first. PICCARD: Exactly. I was fortunate enough to see six Apollo takeoff. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: We have ignition. PICCARD: Apollo 7. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: Lift off. PICCARD: . . . 8. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: We have lift off. PICCARD: . . . 9. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #4: Lift off. We have lift off. PICCARD: . . . 10, 11 and 12. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #5: Lift off. We have lift off - 11:22 a. m. Eastern Standard Time. RAZ: So how does an 11-year-old get to witness six Apollo take offs? Well, Bertrand's dad took him because he was an explorer, too. He was a deep-sea submarine diver. And that same week as Apollo 11. . . PICCARD: My father started his dive in the Gulf Stream with a submarine he had built. There was a crew of six people, and he made a drift mission underwater from Palm Beach, Florida to New Scotland. RAZ: Which is also known as Nova Scotia. Anyway, Bertrand's dad, Jacques, was also the first man, along with Don Walsh, to reach the bottom of the Mariana Trench. More people have walked on the moon than have been to the Mariana trench. It's the deepest underwater spot on earth. And Jacques's father, Auguste. . . PICCARD: My grandfather made the first flight ever into the stratosphere, and he invented the pressurized cabin. And he was the first man to see the curvature of the earth with his own eyes. And you know what is so strange? Is to see that he made his first flight in the stratosphere with a tie. He had a jacket and tie. He had the jacket and the tie - no flying suit. RAZ: So it must've been incredible to grow up like this, I mean, around those guys. PICCARD: No, what was really strange was the fact that as long as it was inside my family, I thought it was normal. So there was no limit for me between my dreams as a child and the reality that I could see through all the people I met. RAZ: OK, so back to that week in July 1969. Bertran's dad, fresh off his undersea mission, wanted his son to see the men who were headed to the moon. PICCARD: And I met most of the astronauts also the evening before. RAZ: And you were just a kid. PICCARD: Yeah, I was 11 years old. But, you know, it's fabulous moment where you open yourself to the world because, you know, at that age, you still have everything to learn. So you're very receptive to everything. And it was so fascinating to see these two feats of exploration down and up in the same week. And I thought that's the type of life I would like to have. RAZ: So that's the type of life he chose. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #6: Two Europeans attempting to go around the world in a balloon have broken the record for the longest flying time by a hot air balloon without refueling or stopping. Brian Jones of England and Bertrand Piccard of Switzerland. . . RAZ: In 1999, 30 years after he watched Apollo 11 go to the moon, Bertrand and Brian Jones became the first men to circle the globe in a hot air balloon. It took them 20 days. They flew as high as 37,000 feet and as fast as 160 miles an hour. And the pressurized capsule that they traveled in, it now sits at the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum in Washington, D. C. right next to the Apollo 11 command module. And at a press conference after he landed, reporters asked Bertrand. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #7: Several people have asked what you will be doing next, and should there be other around-the-world balloon missions. Would you all comment on that? PICCARD: Well, a lot of people will say that it's the ultimate flight and there's nothing left. Probably the people said that after the Wright Brothers' flight. So. . . RAZ: And just like the Wright Brothers' flight, they eventually led to transatlantic travel and jet airplanes. Bertrand's balloon trip was actually the start of another mission - a mission that could change the way we all travel. Here's Bertrand telling a story from the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)PICCARD: Well, the unknown is part of life. And in that sense, ballooning is a beautiful metaphor because in a balloon, like in life, we want to go in the direction, but the winds push us in another direction, like in life. And as long as we fight horizontally against life, against the winds, life is a nightmare. When Brian Jones and I were flying around the world, the weatherman asked us one day to fly quite low and very slow. And when we calculated we thought we're never going to make it around the world at that speed. So we dissipate. We flew much higher and double the speed. And I was so proud to have found that jet stream that I call the weatherman and I told him, hey, guy, don't you think we're good pilots up there. We fly twice the speed you predicted. And he told me don't do that. Go down immediately and told us to slow down. And I started to argue. I said I'm not going to do that. We don't have enough gas to fly so slow. And he told me, yes, but with the low pressure you have on your left, if you fly too fast, in a couple of hours, you will turn left and end up at the North Pole. And then he asked me - and this is something I would never forget in my life. He just asked me, you're the good pilot up there. What do you really want? You want to go very fast in the wrong direction or slowly in the good direction? And this is why you need weathermen. This is why you need people with long-term vision. So we went down actually. We slowed down, and we went through moments of fears because we had no idea how the little amount of gas we had in the balloon could allow us to travel 45,000 kilometers. But we accepted to have doubts. We accepted to have fears. And actually this is where the adventure really started. RAZ: Which brings us back to Bertrand's idea for the future of transportation because on that flight, that balloon flight in 1999, somewhere in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, Bertrand and his partner, Brian Jones, were struggling to find the jet stream that would take them across the ocean. And they were burning way too much fuel. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PICCARD: We're a little afraid - little afraid, Brian and I. We talked about it - have the butterflies in the stomach. RAZ: So this is audio from a recording Bertrand made inside the capsule at the time drifting over the ocean. And when they finally touched down in the Egyptian desert after 20 days. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PICCARD: It's fabulous. Thank you. RAZ: Bertrand and his partner looked at a line of frost on their last fuel tank. And they realized just how close they came to not making it. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BRIAN JONES: That's how much fuel we've got left. PICCARD: After three weeks? JONES: After three weeks. PICCARD: And 40,000 kilometers. JONES: What a wonderful piece of planning on our behalf. RAZ: So it was almost empty when you landed. PICCARD: Yeah, absolutely. There were probably two more hours of duration after 20 days of flight. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)PICCARD: When I saw that, I made a promise to myself. I made the promise that the next time I would fly around the world, it would be with no fuel - independent from fossil energies - in order to be safe, not to be threatened by the fuel gauge. I had no idea how it was possible. I just thought it's a dream, and I want to do it. And when the capsule of my balloon was introduced officially in the Air and Space Museum in Washington together with the airplane of Charles Lindbergh, with Apollo 11, with the Wright Brothers' flyer, with Chuck Yeager's X-1, I had really felt that. I thought, wow, the 20th century, that was brilliant. It allowed to do all this things there, but it would not be possible in the future anymore. It takes too much energy. It will cost too much. It will be prohibited because we'll have to save our natural resources in a few decades from now. So how can we perpetrate this pioneering spirit with something that will be independent from fossil energy? Pioneering spirit for me means to observe what we have learned to do and what we have learned to think and to believe and try something else. It's an active disruptive behavior from what we have learned to what we would like to achieve. RAZ: And that disruptive thing for Bertran, an airplane that flies day and night entirely on solar energy. He's already flown it across the U. S. And next year, over the course of five months, Bertrand Piccard plans to fly that plane - that's called the Solar Impulse - he plans to fly it around the world. And he wants to prove that a new revolution in transportation technology is actually within reach. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)PICCARD: So the idea is that if we fly around the world in a solar-powered airplane using absolutely no fuel, nobody ever could say in the future that it's impossible to do it for cars, for heating system, for computers and so on and so on. And this is exactly the symbol of our world. If our airplane is too heavy, if the pilot wastes his energy, we'll never make it through the night. And in our world, if we keep on spoiling, wasting our energy and resources, if we keep on building things that consume so much energy, that's most of the companies now go bankrupt. It's clear that we'll never give the planet to the next generation without a major problem. So you see that this airplane is more a symbol. I don't think it will transport 200 people in the next years. But when Lindbergh crossed the Atlantic, the payload was also just sufficient for one person and some fuel. And 20 years later, there were 200 people in every airplane crossing the Atlantic. People will tell you it's impossible, and it's exactly why we try to do it. And in 50 years, if we still need to use fuel, air travel will be in trouble - really in trouble because we'll be in a world of renewable energies where there will be either a lot of restrictions and regulations about fossil energy or maybe just a price of fossil energy that will be so high that people won't use it anymore. RAZ: Do you see - like, can you imagine a future where we get around, either locally or transcontinentally, like, through solar power - like, solar power will generate the energy to move us around? PICCARD: I would be crazy to say yes and stupid to say no because today we don't have the technology to move everybody on solar power. But don't forget, when Charles Lindbergh flew across the Atlantic, he was alone on board. And we had to wait for maybe 25 or 30 more years before they could become commercial airliners. So we just have to insufflate the pioneering spirit, which means to open new doors. We have to understand now that we have to be open to change. All the people who fight to keep their old technologies are people who will disappear. RAZ: Bertrand Piccard's talk can be found at ted. npr. org. You can also check out what his team is up to at solarimpulse. com. Our show today, transport for a crowded planet. I'm Guy Raz. And you're listening to the TED Radio Hour from NPR. GUY RAZ, HOST:  It's the TED Radio Hour from NPR. I'm Guy Raz. And on the show today, ideas about how technology and a crowded planet will change almost everything we know about getting from Point A to Point B. And our first story begins about half a century ago. BERTRAND PICCARD: (French spoken). RAZ: Was there, like, a moment when you knew that you wanted to explore the skies? PICCARD: Yes, a very precise moment. That was in July 1969. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Lift off. We have a lift off - 32 minutes past the hour. Lift off on Apollo 11. RAZ: This is Bertrand Piccard. PICCARD: I'm, at the same time, medical doctor and explorer and. . . RAZ: In July 1969, the Apollo 11 launched to the moon. Betrand Piccard was 11 years old at the time. And he was there to see it happen. And that launch, it wasn't Bertrand's first. PICCARD: Exactly. I was fortunate enough to see six Apollo takeoff. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: We have ignition. PICCARD: Apollo 7. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: Lift off. PICCARD: . . . 8. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: We have lift off. PICCARD: . . . 9. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED MAN #4: Lift off. We have lift off. PICCARD: . . . 10, 11 and 12. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED MAN #5: Lift off. We have lift off - 11:22 a. m. Eastern Standard Time. RAZ: So how does an 11-year-old get to witness six Apollo take offs? Well, Bertrand's dad took him because he was an explorer, too. He was a deep-sea submarine diver. And that same week as Apollo 11. . . PICCARD: My father started his dive in the Gulf Stream with a submarine he had built. There was a crew of six people, and he made a drift mission underwater from Palm Beach, Florida to New Scotland. RAZ: Which is also known as Nova Scotia. Anyway, Bertrand's dad, Jacques, was also the first man, along with Don Walsh, to reach the bottom of the Mariana Trench. More people have walked on the moon than have been to the Mariana trench. It's the deepest underwater spot on earth. And Jacques's father, Auguste. . . PICCARD: My grandfather made the first flight ever into the stratosphere, and he invented the pressurized cabin. And he was the first man to see the curvature of the earth with his own eyes. And you know what is so strange? Is to see that he made his first flight in the stratosphere with a tie. He had a jacket and tie. He had the jacket and the tie - no flying suit. RAZ: So it must've been incredible to grow up like this, I mean, around those guys. PICCARD: No, what was really strange was the fact that as long as it was inside my family, I thought it was normal. So there was no limit for me between my dreams as a child and the reality that I could see through all the people I met. RAZ: OK, so back to that week in July 1969. Bertran's dad, fresh off his undersea mission, wanted his son to see the men who were headed to the moon. PICCARD: And I met most of the astronauts also the evening before. RAZ: And you were just a kid. PICCARD: Yeah, I was 11 years old. But, you know, it's fabulous moment where you open yourself to the world because, you know, at that age, you still have everything to learn. So you're very receptive to everything. And it was so fascinating to see these two feats of exploration down and up in the same week. And I thought that's the type of life I would like to have. RAZ: So that's the type of life he chose. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED MAN #6: Two Europeans attempting to go around the world in a balloon have broken the record for the longest flying time by a hot air balloon without refueling or stopping. Brian Jones of England and Bertrand Piccard of Switzerland. . . RAZ: In 1999, 30 years after he watched Apollo 11 go to the moon, Bertrand and Brian Jones became the first men to circle the globe in a hot air balloon. It took them 20 days. They flew as high as 37,000 feet and as fast as 160 miles an hour. And the pressurized capsule that they traveled in, it now sits at the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum in Washington, D. C. right next to the Apollo 11 command module. And at a press conference after he landed, reporters asked Bertrand. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED MAN #7: Several people have asked what you will be doing next, and should there be other around-the-world balloon missions. Would you all comment on that? PICCARD: Well, a lot of people will say that it's the ultimate flight and there's nothing left. Probably the people said that after the Wright Brothers' flight. So. . . RAZ: And just like the Wright Brothers' flight, they eventually led to transatlantic travel and jet airplanes. Bertrand's balloon trip was actually the start of another mission - a mission that could change the way we all travel. Here's Bertrand telling a story from the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) PICCARD: Well, the unknown is part of life. And in that sense, ballooning is a beautiful metaphor because in a balloon, like in life, we want to go in the direction, but the winds push us in another direction, like in life. And as long as we fight horizontally against life, against the winds, life is a nightmare. When Brian Jones and I were flying around the world, the weatherman asked us one day to fly quite low and very slow. And when we calculated we thought we're never going to make it around the world at that speed. So we dissipate. We flew much higher and double the speed. And I was so proud to have found that jet stream that I call the weatherman and I told him, hey, guy, don't you think we're good pilots up there. We fly twice the speed you predicted. And he told me don't do that. Go down immediately and told us to slow down. And I started to argue. I said I'm not going to do that. We don't have enough gas to fly so slow. And he told me, yes, but with the low pressure you have on your left, if you fly too fast, in a couple of hours, you will turn left and end up at the North Pole. And then he asked me - and this is something I would never forget in my life. He just asked me, you're the good pilot up there. What do you really want? You want to go very fast in the wrong direction or slowly in the good direction? And this is why you need weathermen. This is why you need people with long-term vision. So we went down actually. We slowed down, and we went through moments of fears because we had no idea how the little amount of gas we had in the balloon could allow us to travel 45,000 kilometers. But we accepted to have doubts. We accepted to have fears. And actually this is where the adventure really started. RAZ: Which brings us back to Bertrand's idea for the future of transportation because on that flight, that balloon flight in 1999, somewhere in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, Bertrand and his partner, Brian Jones, were struggling to find the jet stream that would take them across the ocean. And they were burning way too much fuel. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PICCARD: We're a little afraid - little afraid, Brian and I. We talked about it - have the butterflies in the stomach. RAZ: So this is audio from a recording Bertrand made inside the capsule at the time drifting over the ocean. And when they finally touched down in the Egyptian desert after 20 days. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) PICCARD: It's fabulous. Thank you. RAZ: Bertrand and his partner looked at a line of frost on their last fuel tank. And they realized just how close they came to not making it. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) BRIAN JONES: That's how much fuel we've got left. PICCARD: After three weeks? JONES: After three weeks. PICCARD: And 40,000 kilometers. JONES: What a wonderful piece of planning on our behalf. RAZ: So it was almost empty when you landed. PICCARD: Yeah, absolutely. There were probably two more hours of duration after 20 days of flight. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) PICCARD: When I saw that, I made a promise to myself.

I'm Melissa Block. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST: And I'm Audie Cornish. On a spring evening earlier this year, some residents of Fairbanks, Alaska picked up a mysterious signal. (SOUNDBITE OF BEEPING)CORNISH: It was followed by eerie music. (SOUNDBITE OF EERIE MUSIC)CORNISH: It came from a remote Air Force research facility 200 miles away. The facility is used by scientists to study the very edge of the Earth's atmosphere, and over the years it's become the subject of countless Internet conspiracies. NPR's Geoff Brumfiel reports both the research and the conspiracies may soon come to an end. GEOFF BRUMFIEL, BYLINE: Well, it sure looks suspicious. A fenced-off military compound filled with nearly 200 weird-looking antennas, each several stories tall, in the middle of nowheres-ville, Alaska. It's called HAARP, the High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program. DENNIS PAPADOPOULOS: I was giving an interview at HAARP, and the reporter said HAARP is number five on the Internet conspiracies, following the Kennedy assassination, which is number four. BRUMFIEL: Dennis Papadopoulos is a physicist at the University of Maryland. He uses HAARP for his research. He's heard all the conspiracies. PAPADOPOULOS: Using HAARP, you can change the weather. You can do all kinds of things. BRUMFIEL: Just Google it - HAARP with two A's. You'll see what it can do. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Disrupt human mental processes - jam all global communications - interfere with wildlife migration patterns. . . BRUMFIEL: Trigger earthquakes - spark tsunamis - the list goes on and on. But the real reason HAARP exists is less exciting. PAPADOPOULOS: We are studying the region through which all the signals, from satellites to your TV and GPS, go through. And it's called the ionosphere. BRUMFIEL: The ionosphere is at the very top of the Earth's atmosphere - the edge of space. It's filled with charged particles that respond to radio waves. HAARP studies the ionosphere by beaming radio waves straight up into it. PAPADOPOULOS: It's like a radio station, but much more powerful. BRUMFIEL: HAARP is even powerful enough to create an artificial aurora high in the sky. The research has the potential to improve satellite communications and navigation. And yes, the military has used it to study things they don't talk about. PAPADOPOULOS: On occasion. There have been secret experiments. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Secret experiments for mind control? PAPADOPOULOS: If we could do that, as I say, we'll patent it. (Laughing) We'll sell it to the world, straight. BRUMFIEL: So much for that. And what about that unearthly music you heard at the beginning of the story? Actually, it's no mystery. It came from this guy. CHRIS FALLEN: Chris Fallen - I am a research assistant professor at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. BRUMFIEL: Since HAARP is basically a giant radio station, Fallen decided to try an experiment. FALLEN: I was transmitting a musical performance that was composed by visiting musicians. BRUMFIEL: He was testing something known as the Luxembourg effect. Put down that tinfoil hat, it's legit. When radio signals at different frequencies bounce off the ionosphere, they can mix together. Fallen split the music. FALLEN: So one half of the performance was transmitted on 3. 25 megahertz. And the other half of the performance was broadcast on 4. 25 megahertz. BRUMFIEL: The ionosphere blended the halves into a single song and reflected it back down to Fairbanks. FALLEN: These two different musical performances were essentially mixed in space. REPORTER: But Fallen's cosmic concerts and the other research is ending. The $300 million facility was originally built at the behest of a powerful former Senator from Alaska, Ted Stevens. Stevens died in a plane crash in 2010, and now the Air Force says it doesn't want to pay to keep HAARP open. So the facility is switching off, today. Unless independent scientists can find a way to save it, it will soon be bulldozed. It will vanish without a trace. That should give the conspiracy theorists something to talk about.

It turns out spiders can also do something quite extraordinary with their silk webs. They can tune them like musical instruments. NPR's Christopher Joyce has the story on the music of the web. CHRISTOPHER JOYCE, BYLINE: In England, there's a scientific team called the Oxford Silk Group. No, they're not about school neckties. They study silk from animals, like spiders. Why? BETH MORTIMER: Spider silk has been evolving for over 350 million years. And it's something that we haven't been able to re-create. JOYCE: Beth Mortimer is a biologist at Oxford University, and she's discovered that many of the silk elements or strands in a web actually vibrate like strings on a musical instrument. MORTIMER: If you think about something like a violin or a guitar, for certain lengths of string, you can have different pitches that come out of your instrument. JOYCE: OK, let's take a guitar string. (SOUNDBITE OF GUITAR)JOYCE: The string's thickness, its length and tension determine what pitch you get. In this case, a G note. And it turns out the spiders, mostly with sensors in their legs, can distinguish between different vibrations or pitches traveling up and down the silk web. But here's something more amazing. A spider will sometimes tighten or loosen those silk strands. MORTIMER: So it can actually very finely tune how the silk's vibrating. JOYCE: On a guitar, kind of like this. (SOUNDBITE OF GUITAR)JOYCE: Mortimer's team used lasers to actually observe spiders tuning their webs. They describe this in the journal \"Material Views\". As to why they do it, well, when an insect gets snagged in the web an array of vibrations courses through it. The spider reads them, say, to locate where a struggling insect is stuck. And apparently, the web has to be tuned just right to do that. And sometimes a spider will even play the web to get information. MORTIMER: The spider can actually pluck or bounce the silk strings. (SOUNDBITE OF GUITAR)MORTIMER: And it can monitor the echoes that come back, so it can locate objects. JOYCE: Now with all those strands in a web, you can imagine with spider must be sensing when a big bug flies into it and thrashes around. (SOUNDBITE OF GUITAR)JOYCE: But sometimes spiders get visitors that are not prey, rather, their potential mates. Mortimer suspects the web owner can distinguish that kind of vibration from others. One can only imagine what a potential mate might sound like. (SOUNDBITE OF GUITAR)JOYCE: Christopher Joyce, NPR News.

The Chrysler Museum of Art is nearby, as are dozens of stately homes - all threatened by the water. SKIP STILES: We've got these - lots of old buildings around here. This apartment building, that church over there - been around since the turn of the last century. And you can sort of mark where the storms have come over the years, and you can see the progress of these storms as they come farther and farther up onto these buildings. NAYLOR: Stiles is Executive Director of Wetlands Watch, a Virginia environmental group. The church over there, he mentioned, is the Unitarian Church of Norfolk - likely one of the few houses of worship in America with a link to a tide chart on its website. The Reverend Jennifer Slade is the minister. REVEREND JENNIFER SLADE: People literally cannot get to church or may decide not to come because high tide's going to be at a certain time, and they may not be able to get out. NAYLOR: Needless to say, this has caused the church and its members some problems. No one has been stranded yet, but Reverend Slade says a memorial service over the weekend was carefully planned. SLADE: We actually had to time the memorial service and the reception to make sure that the service and the reception could happen before high tide. NAYLOR: The Unitarian Church is considering moving to a new building. There are a number of reasons, but a big one is the flooding. Repeated high water forced the art museum to move its heating and cooling systems out of the basement onto an upper level. Larry Atkinson is co-director of the Climate Change and Sea Level Rise Initiative at Old Dominion University - says the problems the church and the museum are facing are repeated throughout the region. LARRY ATKINSON: When there's a higher high tide and there's a heavy rainstorm, there's just no place for water to go. So there's been a lot of storm-water management, a lot of roads being raised - downtown Norfolk - there's a big sea wall with tide gates to protect the downtown financial district. NAYLOR: Not all of the Hampton Road's flooding problems can be blamed on climate change. Atkinson says the region is also slowly sinking, making the low-lying areas that much more vulnerable to flooding. But there's also no doubt that sea levels in the area have been rising - as much as a foot over the last 80 years or so. And the Virginia Institute of Marine Science report predicts another foot and a half rise over the next 50 years. The government says the region, historically dependent on the sea for centuries, is the most vulnerable to sea level rise on the East Coast. Along with the world's largest naval port, Norfolk is also home to the hemisphere's biggest coal terminal, where long trains full of coal from throughout Appalachia empty their loads into waiting ships for export around the world. This promotional video was produced by the terminal's owner, Norfolk Southern. (SOUNDBITE OF PROMOTIONAL VIDEO). UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Pier 6 opened in 1962 as the hemisphere's largest, fastest and most efficient coal trans-loading facility. In short, it is a pier without peer. NAYLOR: Puns aside, it also makes Norfolk the nexus of the debate between coal and climate. Skip Stiles of Wetlands Watch. STILES: There is a bit of an irony that Norfolk has the largest coal export facility in North America, and we've also got the highest rate of sea level rise on the East Coast - can't escape that irony. NAYLOR: The irony, in fact, isn't going away. Democratic Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia says his state has to protect the jobs coal producers while it deals with the harm caused by putting carbon into the air. SENATOR TIM KAINE: We're going to continue to use coal. I mean, nobody is saying just throw a brake on the 35 or 40 percent of American energy production that's coal. So in Virginia, we have coal to worry about. We also have sea level rise to worry about. NAYLOR: In Tidewater Virginia, that worry is a day-to-day thing. The city of Norfolk is considering a multi million dollar plan to erect new flood barriers, but it's unclear where that money will come from. Brian Naylor, NPR News. MONTAGNE: You're listening to MORNING EDITION from NPR News. RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST:   Climate change may still be an abstract concept to many, but in the Hampton Roads area of Virginia, it is very real. Rising sea levels have made flooding a regular part of life there. Scientists say coal-burning power plants are a leading cause of climate change, and Virginia is a major coal-producing state.

CHRISTOPHER JOYCE, BYLINE: Scientists once thought dinosaurs were sluggish cold-blooded creatures. Tail draggers they called them.

JOYCE: Grady's an ecologist at the University of New Mexico. He thinks the not too hot or too cold lifestyle was a useful adaptation by dinosaurs. After all they evolved into a world already populated with big slow cold-blooded reptiles. GRADY: You know if you are a little bit warmer blooded than a reptile essentially your muscles fire faster, your nerves fire faster, your kind of a more dangerous predator. JOYCE: At the same time a bit of cold bloodedness has its charms. You burn energy more slowly so you don't have to eat as much to grow. Think of a crocodile or a snake that can live for a month on one meal. GRADY: And that means they could maybe get a lot bigger than a mammal could be. Which wouldn't be able to eat enough if it was the size of a Tyrannosaurus rex. JOYCE: A mammal the size of a T-Rex would have to eat 24/7 to feed its supercharged metabolism. So Grady suggests that dinosaurs probably could generate body heat but not maintain a constant temperature. That meant they could be fast and big. Writing in the journal \"Science\" Grady explains how his team figured all this out. They relied on this fact, warm-blooded animals grow fast and cold-blooded ones slowly. And the dinosaur bones show that they grew faster than reptiles but not quite as fast as mammals. Grady determined that from reading growth lines in dinosaur bones. They're kind of like tree rings.

ERICKSON: The present's the key to the past. If we can garner an understanding of how living animals work and it then we could get similar information from fossils then we can understand what happened in the past.

The vast majority of marine debris, about 75 percent of it, is plastic - plastic rope, plastic bottles, packaging materials, food containers, fishing line, plastic bags. These may break down into smaller and smaller pieces, but they never biodegrade. And those tiny pieces - or micro-plastics - threaten marine life too. Marine biologist Richard Thompson of Plymouth University in England has been studying the effects of those tiny particles as small as a grain of sand. RICHARD THOMPSON: If we were to have, say a coffee mug in front of us, full of sand and we worked our way through it, we might only be finding 2, 3, 4, 5 - perhaps an exception - 20 pieces of micro-plastic, which doesn't seem a lot out of a coffee mug full of sand. BLOCK: Yeah. THOMPSON: But when you scale that up to the number of beaches worldwide and you consider that this material's also present at the ocean's surface and at the seabed, you realize that there's actually quite a lot of material that's present at this microscopic scale. And it certainly appears now that that is the most numerous type of marine debris - these microscopic fractions. And of course over time, what we would like to expect is that the large items that are present in the ocean today will break down progressively into these smaller and smaller pieces. So you know, unfortunately, even if we were to stop releasing plastic to the oceans tomorrow, we would still likely see an increase in these very, very small particles. And that's why it's important that we understand the potential consequences. BLOCK: Well, what are the consequences? Why are these tiny particles such a big problem? THOMPSON: They are of concern because they could result in different problems to the larger debris. And we don't fully understand, at the moment, the nature of those problems. We know that large items of debris can threaten a whole range of species through entanglement and ingestion. And of course the smaller the piece of debris, the more accessible it is - the wider the range of creatures that could potentially eat it, including some quite small marine invertebrates. Things, you know, less than an inch in length - some small selfish, small marine worms have the potential to ingest these microscopic fragments of plastic. One recent study looking at a commercial species of crustacean - a kind of small lobster - the Dublin Bay prawn - showed that over 80 percent of some populations had small but had quantities of plastic in their guts - not very many particles, but 80 percent of the individuals. Similarly, if we look at some seabirds - if we look at the northern fauna - we find that up to 95 percent of some populations have got plastic in their gut. So there's cause for concern there, first, to want to understand more about the impacts. BLOCK: Along with ingesting these microscopic particles, there have been studies done - necropsy's done on wildlife show huge amounts of big pieces of plastic inside their systems. What do those studies show? THOMPSON: Well, I've seen examples from the guts of a whale, which has shown substantial numbers of plastic bags. I've seen examples coming from large seabirds, like an albatross, which could contain really quite large everyday items like a toothbrush or a cigarette lighter. BLOCK: Short of banning plastics altogether, what would you say is a solution that would reduce - have an impact on the amount of plastic that ends up in our oceans? THOMPSON: The solution certainly is not about banning plastic. Plastics are not the enemy here at all. In fact, plastics bring many societal benefits. And I believe that in the long-term, plastics will help to reduce our environmental footprint on the planet. So it's not about banning plastics, it's about thinking of the ways that we deal with plastics at the end of their lifetime to make sure that we capture the resource. The plastic bottles can be recycled and turned back into new plastic items. So same for many of the things that we see in the sea. If we could capture them and harness that resource and use again, it would be much more efficient. BLOCK: And what about cleaning up the vast amount of plastic that's already in the ocean? How do you deal with that? THOMPSON: Well, cleanup of course is very important because our seas are heavily contaminated with plastic debris. The problem is, that at the moment, we're putting this debris and so quickly and we don't have absolute numbers on the rates of injury to the ocean but the quantities are so substantial that it's going to be almost most impossible for us to think about cleaning up as fast as it's going in. So the analogy I would use is, it's a little bit like trying to mop the floor up in your bathroom. If the bath is overflowing and both taps in the bath and the shower are all running at full speed, it's a waste of time trying to just clean up. You will need to clean up eventually but the first thing is to stem the flow. And that has to be the priority. BLOCK: Professor Thompson, thanks for coming in. THOMPSON: Thank you very much.

These collections became more formalized with biologists, like Charles Darwin, who brought back all kinds of crustaceans and insects and birds from distant lands. Even today, scientists collect specimens for study - it's routine. Too routine, some critics say. They believe scientific collection is helping drive some species towards extinction. As NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce reports, this charge has provoked a strong reaction from universities and museums. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE, BYLINE: To understand what a big deal specimen collecting is, I visited a vast warehouse-like room filled with dead birds - over half a million of them. They're stored inside tall stacks of metal cabinets. Helen James has pulled out some birds that are so colorful they almost seem to glow. HELEN JAMES: The birds are showing their beautiful plumages, they're laid out like little soldiers in a row. We have some of the most amazing hummingbirds. Here's one with a long straight bill that's longer than the bird itself. Here is the smallest species of a reportorial bird - a tiny little falcon. GREENFIELDBOYCE: And so how often does somebody, like, walk out here and open a cabinet and pull out a bird? JAMES: Probably every hour. GREENFIELDBOYCE: James is the curator in charge of birds at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History. She says these specimens can help answer almost any question about birds you can think of - how these species evolved, how populations have changed over time, scientists can even take bits of specimens and use them to analyze the birds DNA or test for diseases or toxins. The oldest specimens date back to the 1840's but new ones are always arriving. James opens a big black case. It belongs to a colleague who just returned from Djibouti in Africa. JAMES: So this is how it comes back from the field. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Underneath a layer of cotton is a tray of black and white birds pinned down so that they'll dry in the right position. JAMES: And these three here are crab plovers. This is a very special addition to our collection because we do not have any modern genetic material of this family. GREENFIELDBOYCE: She says this will help them finally figure out how this strange shorebird fits into the bird family tree. The Smithsonian doesn't just gather birds but also fish, insects, reptiles - the collections are huge. And James says, most of the world's species are still out there - unknown and waiting to be discovered. To her, the need for more collecting is obvious - so she was alarmed by a recent article. It appeared in the high profile journal \"Science. \" Its message - collecting can sometimes be dangerous. BEN MINTEER: There's a real concern here that there was an issue of scientific responsibility. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Ben Minteer is an ethicist at Arizona State University and one of the article's authors. He argues that if an animal is rare and potentially threatened, scientists should think twice before they grab it and take it home. MINTEER: You know, if we're dealing with very small populations where individuals really matter in these populations it doesn't take many researchers filling, you know, their specimen bags to have an impact. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Minteer started thinking about this because of a biologist named Robert Puschendorf. He works at Plymouth University in the United Kingdom. Last year, Puschendorf was doing fieldwork in the mountains of Costa Rica. When he heard that a tree frog that was once thought to be extinct had just been spotted. ROBERT PUSCHENDORF: And a colleague of mine was telling us about it and he was really excited about it. GREENFIELDBOYCE: That night they searched for this frog but had no luck. Then, in the morning, they heard that someone else had found one and collected it. That worried him. PUSCHENDORF: I have collected lots of animals in the past and that's incredibly important but in this case I just thought, well this is just really not on because why do we actually need to take the animal right in this point in time when they're just starting to show up again, in our sight again, and you can actually be harming that population. GREENFIELDBOYCE: He and a colleague asked Minteer to help them sort out the ethics here. The group concluded that in this kind of situation biologists should leave the animals in the wild. They say, these days, there are alternatives for documenting a species - like sampling its DNA or taking photographs. To Minteer, this was a no-brainer. MINTEER: The surprise for me was the degree to which some of the biologist community and the museum community felt that this was an all-out attack on what they do. CAROLE BALDWIN: If we don't have the specimens then we can't obtain the data that we actually need to conserve the species. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Carole Baldwin is the curator in charge of the fish division at the Smithsonian. She studies life in coral reefs. BALDWIN: Most of the organisms that I study, you're not just going to go out with a submersible or scuba gear or snorkel gear and get photographs. These things are living cryptically in reefs. It's not swimming out above the reef - it's down, deep inside. GREENFIELDBOYCE: She says to study it you have to collect it. BALDWIN: You're not going to come to me with photographs and DNA unless you've got a specimen. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Baldwin points out that laws and regulations already protect wildlife. BALDWIN: It's getting harder and harder to get approval and permits to collect. And I think part of our concern is that articles, like the Minteer et al. article, sort of swing the balance in the wrong way in terms of public perception. GREENFIELDBOYCE: That's why she joined over 100 other scientists from around the world to sign a letter that strongly defends the continued need for specimen collection. Helen James, the bird curator, also signed it. JAMES: When it suggested that you should cease collecting because, maybe, there's a case when you don't know whether you might collect something rare - then that argues that we should cease collecting generally. GREENFIELDBOYCE: She says scientific collection makes up just a tiny, tiny fraction of all the birds killed by people. Mostly, we destroy their habitat but that's not all. JAMES: There are over a billion birds taken by domestic cats. There are half - over half a billion birds that fly into our buildings every year and die just in the U. S. And there, you know, a hundred million or more that are killed on our highways. GREENFIELDBOYCE: This kind of response makes Ben Minteer think that everyone is missing the point. MINTEER: We're not claiming that scientific collection is a leading driver of extinction. That's a, sort of, absurd, sort of, hyperbolic interpretation of what we're saying. GREENFIELDBOYCE: They just wanted to raise awareness of a problem. MINTEER: You know, it's one thing for a community to say, look we have a code of ethics, we abide by it, no responsible biologist would ever do this. You know, we think that those are all good things and good statements but it's harder to actually create a sort of ethical culture in the field when no one's looking - when no one's watching. GREENFIELDBOYCE: He says biologist can't afford to be defensive. They need to have a real discussion about how to weigh the benefits of collecting a specimen with the risks. Nell Greenfieldboyce, NPR News. MONTAGNE: This is NPR News. RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST:  Cabinets of curiosities - that's what wealthy people in 18th and 19th centuries called the rooms they filled with everything from narwhal horns to preserved crocodiles. These collections became more formalized with biologists, like Charles Darwin, who brought back all kinds of crustaceans and insects and birds from distant lands. Even today, scientists collect specimens for study - it's routine. Too routine, some critics say. They believe scientific collection is helping drive some species towards extinction. As NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce reports, this charge has provoked a strong reaction from universities and museums. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE, BYLINE: To understand what a big deal specimen collecting is, I visited a vast warehouse-like room filled with dead birds - over half a million of them. They're stored inside tall stacks of metal cabinets. Helen James has pulled out some birds that are so colorful they almost seem to glow. HELEN JAMES: The birds are showing their beautiful plumages, they're laid out like little soldiers in a row. We have some of the most amazing hummingbirds. Here's one with a long straight bill that's longer than the bird itself. Here is the smallest species of a reportorial bird - a tiny little falcon. GREENFIELDBOYCE: And so how often does somebody, like, walk out here and open a cabinet and pull out a bird? JAMES: Probably every hour. GREENFIELDBOYCE: James is the curator in charge of birds at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History. She says these specimens can help answer almost any question about birds you can think of - how these species evolved, how populations have changed over time, scientists can even take bits of specimens and use them to analyze the birds DNA or test for diseases or toxins. The oldest specimens date back to the 1840's but new ones are always arriving. James opens a big black case. It belongs to a colleague who just returned from Djibouti in Africa. JAMES: So this is how it comes back from the field. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Underneath a layer of cotton is a tray of black and white birds pinned down so that they'll dry in the right position. JAMES: And these three here are crab plovers. This is a very special addition to our collection because we do not have any modern genetic material of this family. GREENFIELDBOYCE: She says this will help them finally figure out how this strange shorebird fits into the bird family tree. The Smithsonian doesn't just gather birds but also fish, insects, reptiles - the collections are huge. And James says, most of the world's species are still out there - unknown and waiting to be discovered. To her, the need for more collecting is obvious - so she was alarmed by a recent article. It appeared in the high profile journal \"Science. \" Its message - collecting can sometimes be dangerous. BEN MINTEER: There's a real concern here that there was an issue of scientific responsibility. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Ben Minteer is an ethicist at Arizona State University and one of the article's authors. He argues that if an animal is rare and potentially threatened, scientists should think twice before they grab it and take it home. MINTEER: You know, if we're dealing with very small populations where individuals really matter in these populations it doesn't take many researchers filling, you know, their specimen bags to have an impact. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Minteer started thinking about this because of a biologist named Robert Puschendorf. He works at Plymouth University in the United Kingdom. Last year, Puschendorf was doing fieldwork in the mountains of Costa Rica. When he heard that a tree frog that was once thought to be extinct had just been spotted. ROBERT PUSCHENDORF: And a colleague of mine was telling us about it and he was really excited about it. GREENFIELDBOYCE: That night they searched for this frog but had no luck. Then, in the morning, they heard that someone else had found one and collected it. That worried him. PUSCHENDORF: I have collected lots of animals in the past and that's incredibly important but in this case I just thought, well this is just really not on because why do we actually need to take the animal right in this point in time when they're just starting to show up again, in our sight again, and you can actually be harming that population. GREENFIELDBOYCE: He and a colleague asked Minteer to help them sort out the ethics here. The group concluded that in this kind of situation biologists should leave the animals in the wild. They say, these days, there are alternatives for documenting a species - like sampling its DNA or taking photographs. To Minteer, this was a no-brainer. MINTEER: The surprise for me was the degree to which some of the biologist community and the museum community felt that this was an all-out attack on what they do. CAROLE BALDWIN: If we don't have the specimens then we can't obtain the data that we actually need to conserve the species. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Carole Baldwin is the curator in charge of the fish division at the Smithsonian. She studies life in coral reefs. BALDWIN: Most of the organisms that I study, you're not just going to go out with a submersible or scuba gear or snorkel gear and get photographs. These things are living cryptically in reefs. It's not swimming out above the reef - it's down, deep inside. GREENFIELDBOYCE: She says to study it you have to collect it. BALDWIN: You're not going to come to me with photographs and DNA unless you've got a specimen. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Baldwin points out that laws and regulations already protect wildlife. BALDWIN: It's getting harder and harder to get approval and permits to collect. And I think part of our concern is that articles, like the Minteer et al. article, sort of swing the balance in the wrong way in terms of public perception. GREENFIELDBOYCE: That's why she joined over 100 other scientists from around the world to sign a letter that strongly defends the continued need for specimen collection.

But it now appears those distinctive facial features may have come before the big brains. NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce reports on a new study of some ancient human skulls. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE, BYLINE: Scientists want to understand the history of Neanderthals because in some ways they were so much like us, even though they died out. The latest twist in the story of the Neanderthals comes from a mysterious place in Spain known as the Pit of Bones. Jean-Jacques Hublin has been there. He studies evolution at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Germany. He says the Pit of Bones is deep inside a cave in the mountains. JEAN-JACQUES HUBLIN: And it's a very impressive place to visit because you have to walk a long time underground and then to go along a rope ladder in this deep well in the dark before you get into this kind of small chapel with a bed of bones under your feet. GREENFIELDBOYCE: The bones are from an early species of human that lived almost half a million years ago. HUBLIN: There is only one site like this on Earth. I mean a site which is so rich in term of the number of fossils that it yields. GREENFIELDBOYCE: He says bones from the bodies of at least 28 individuals somehow ended up at the bottom of this narrow shaft. How they got there, no one knows. HUBLIN: It's strange. It's a mystery. It's difficult to imagine a natural scenario. My Spanish colleagues propose that actually these bodies had been thrown in this well. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Now those Spanish researchers, along with others on their team, have painstakingly assembled and studied 17 skulls from this bone pit. In the journal Science, they say they used half a dozen different dating techniques to show conclusively that these people lived about 430,000 years ago. That makes these folks the earliest humans to have any Neanderthal-like features. They had faces that look like Neanderthals - no chins, but teeth and jaws that could open wide. Their brain cases were still small and primitive. Rolf Quam, of Binghamton University in New York, was on the research team. He says, it looks like the evolution of Neanderthals may have started with a kind of specialized chewing - why chewing? Quam says they're trying to figure that out. It must have served some purpose. ROLF QUAM: Because it's a complex set of features, it does seem like a good candidate to represent an adaptation, rather than something that occurs randomly by genetic drift. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Maybe they used their teeth almost like a third hand. They could hold a big hunk of meat in their jaw while they cut it, for example. There were other groups of early humans living in Europe at this time. Maybe their powerful jaws gave this particular group some kind of advantage. Quam says, all these skulls seem to be from the same species. QUAM: We do believe that they are probably closely related. They probably are some kind of extended clan. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Scientists are still trying to learn exactly how they're related because that might explain how they all ended up in the same pit. Nell Greenfieldboyce, NPR News.

I'm Guy Raz. On our show today, ideas about why we lie, why we cheat, why we deceive and why we still seem to believe so much of what we're told. DAN ARIELY: Hello, hello. I'm sorry I'm late. RAZ: This is Dan Ariely. ARIELY: I'm the James B. Duke Professor of psychology and behavioral economics at Duke. And what else. . . RAZ: And Dan studies cheating. And when and why we do it. A few years ago Dan was on a business trip. ARIELY: Actually a consulting conference. And I meet John Perry Barlow. RAZ: It turns out that John Perry Barlow used to be a lyricist for the Grateful Dead. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"TRUCKIN'\")JOHN PERRY BARLOW: (Singing) Truckin'. Got my chips cashed in. ARIELY: I love the Grateful Dead and I was very impressed with him. RAZ: Yeah. Great guy to meet at a conference. ARIELY: It was just delightful to meet somebody like him. RAZ: So they started talking. ARIELY: And talking for a while it turns out that he was also a consultant for Enron. RAZ: Grateful Dead to Enron. (SOUNDBITE OF NEWS BROADCAST)UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: It is one of the most stunning collapses in U. S. corporate history. RAZ: Enron was of course a giant energy company based in Houston. And for six straight years Fortune magazine named it the most innovative company in America. (SOUNDBITE OF NEWS BROADCAST)UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: It's hard to believe that I company with revenues of some $100 billion last year would be filing for bankruptcy this year. RAZ: But those $100 billion in revenue - a lie, a fiction. It was totally made up because the company was cheating by making up sales figures and they'd been doing it for years. And most people just assumed it was, you know, a few bad apples at the top. But it turned out that hundreds of people - accountants, managers, consultants - they were all in on the scam as well. And so when Dan Ariely met John Perry Barlow a few years later at that conference he was curious about whether he was involved too. ARIELY: And I asked him about that. And he basically said he didn't see anything going bad. He believed in the company in an unbelievable way. He said he kind of suspended his own understanding of reality was very happy to buy into a new reality. And then of course the moment Enron collapsed he basically asked himself how could I believe that. RAZ: Yeah, I mean, how could he have been there and not seen any of that. ARIELY: And, you know, he's a very smart guy and it's very hard to take somebody you admire and think highly of and basically said, this is a crook. And instead this basically proposed a very different mechanism - if you were getting paid by Enron wouldn't you want to see reality in the way that they were presenting it? And the interesting thing is that if you think that Enron was just kind of three bad people you would say, hey let's just stop hiring bad people or let's find ways to kick them out or - but if you think that it's wishful blindness and all of us are capable of that, that basically requests a very, very different approach. RAZ: That approach - it opened Dan to the possibility that maybe instead of a few really bad apples there might be a lot of kind of bad apples. Dan picks up the idea from the Ted stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)ARIELY: So, like we usually do, I decided to do a simple experiment - and here's how it went. If you were in the experiment I would pass you a sheet of paper with 20 simple math problems that everybody could solve but they wouldn't give you enough time. When the five minutes were over I would say, pass me the sheets of paper and I'll pay you a dollar per question. People did this, I would pay people four dollars for their task - on average, people would solve four problems. Other people I would tempt to cheat. I would pass the sheet of paper, when the five minutes are over I would say, please shred the piece of paper, put the little pieces in your pocket or in your backpack and tell me how many questions you got correctly. People now solved seven questions on average. Now it wasn't as if there was a few bad apples - a few people who cheated a lot. Instead, what we saw is a lot of people who cheat a little bit. Now in economic theory cheating is very a simple cost-benefit analysis. You say, what's the probability of being caught, how much do I stand to gain from cheating and how much punishment would I get if I get caught. And you weigh these options out, you do the simple cost-benefit analysis and you decide whether it's worthwhile to commit the crime or not. So we try to test this. For some people, we varied how much money they could get away with - how much money they could steal. We paid them 10 cents per correct question, 50 cents, $1, $5, $10 per correct question. You would expect that as the amount of money on the table increases people would cheat more but in fact it wasn't the case. We got a lot of people cheating but still by a little bit. What about the probability of being caught? Some people shredded half the people paper so there was some evidence left, some people shredded the whole sheet of paper. Some people shredded everything, went out of the room and paid themselves in the ball of money that had over $100. You would expect that as the probability of being caught goes down people would cheat more but again this was not the case. Again, a lot of people cheated by just a little bit and they were unsensitive to these economic incentives. So it's said if people are not sensitive to the economical rational theory explanations to these forces what could be going on? And we thought maybe what is happening is that there are two forces. At one hand we all want to look ourselves in the mirror and feel good about ourselves, so we don't want to cheat. On the other hand, we could cheat a little bit and still feel good about ourselves. So maybe what is happening is that there's a level of cheating we can't go over but we can still benefit from cheating at a low degree as long as it doesn't change our impressions about ourselves. We call this like a personal fudge factor. Now how would you test a personal fudge factor? Initially we said, what can we do to shrink the fudge factor? So we got people to the lab and we said, we have two tasks for you today. First we asked half the people to recall either 10 books they read in high school or to recall the 10 Commandments and then we tempted them with cheating. Turns out the people who try to recall the 10 Commandments, given the opportunity to cheat, did not cheat at all. It wasn't that the more religious people, the people who remembered the Commandments, cheated less and the religious people, the people who couldn't remember almost any Commandments, cheated more - the moment people thought about trying to recall the 10 Commandments they stop cheating. Now 10 Commandments is something that is hard to bring into the education system so we said, why don't we get people to sign the honor code. So we got people to sign, I understand that these short survey falls under the MIT honor code, then they shredded it, no cheating whatsoever. And this is particularly interesting because MIT doesn't have an honor code. (LAUGHTER)RAZ: That's amazing. So when you introduce, like, an element of moral accountability like signing an honor code the students are less likely to cheat? ARIELY: Yes. So it's basically all about what are you thinking about. Now I don't think this affect last very long. Right, it's not as if we can get people to recite the 10 Commandments once a week and they'll be honest for the whole week. But at least it tells something about the moment it reminds it. And saying that at the moment you can get people to think more deeply about honesty, to be more attentive, it does change your own understanding of what's right and wrong and your ability to rationalize in that moment. It's almost like an anti-rationalization mechanism to think about morality in this way. RAZ: Have you ever, like, taken some printer paper home, like, just paper home to use in your home printer? ARIELY: Oh yeah. Of course but I can justify that very easily. RAZ: But that's not really cheating or being deceitful is it? ARIELY: Actually I'm being helpful. I get to work more at home. RAZ: Exactly. ARIELY: What do you mean? RAZ: But why is that seen as bad behavior? ARIELY: Well I think the thing is that we have this capacity to rationalize all kinds of behaviors like taking paper home. But if it was money and we said, would I take money from the office to buy paper for my home printer I think you would think about it very differently. RAZ: Because that's wrong. ARIELY: That stealing. RAZ: That stealing. ARIELY: Yeah. But if the same thing is framed as something else like a pencil or a piece of paper or something like that all of a sudden we can think about it very differently. And maybe the word think is a bit strange because we basically don't think about it and by not thinking about it very clearly we're basically allowing ourselves to misbehave and still not think of ourselves as bad people. RAZ: Do you assume that everybody you meet or encounter is a cheater in some ways? ARIELY: Well I think of this as human I don't think it's a cheater. But in the same way that we have a hard time, you know, not overeating and saving money and all of those things but dishonesty is also different in a sense that we teach our kids to lie. You know, nobody tell their kids that when they grow up they should always say, honey you look terrible in that dress - right? In the social realm we do understand that people have some benefit from dishonesty and it's an important lubricant for society. But then people moved to the business world and while I want my wife to care about my feelings I don't want my accountant to care about my feelings. Think about something else what happens if you're at a company and some of your friends are misbehaving and now you have a conflict between your friendship, your loyalty to them, your loyal to the company and honesty. RAZ: Which brings us back to 2001 to. . . (SOUNDBITE OF NEWS BROADCAST)UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: One of the most stunning collapses in U. S. corporate history. RAZ: And to Dan's friend John Perry Barlow. ARIELY: He basically said he didn't see anything going bad. RAZ: Now Dan started all his research with one question. And the question was are there just a few really bad apples or their lots and lots of kind of bad apples. But what if there isn't a huge difference between the two. Like, what if the worst of the worst start out like you and me? So for the past two years Dan's been trying to figure out the answer to that question. He's been interviewing some of these really big cheaters. ARIELY: And what they did at the end is just incomprehensible and you say, I can't possibly see myself behaving this way. RAZ: Yeah. ARIELY: But then you look at the details and you look at step one and step one was often innocent and not selfish at all. It was to help other people. It is really this slippery slope of taking one step often for something that at the moment people think is for a good cause. RAZ: I mean, I think that most of us have a limit, right? We have some kind of limit in our minds and I mean that slippery slope cannot apply to everyone. ARIELY: So of course I don't know if it applies to everybody. So the first thing to recognize is I think the ability to rationalize some dishonesty is within us all. On top of that now there's a question of which of us would be able to just cheat a little bit from time to time and which ones of us would be able to go into a slippery slope. Let's assume that you admit to that from time to time you're less than perfectly honest but you've never a been onto the slippery slope and, you know, you go and you get a job - let's say a banker at Goldman Sachs. And there are things about the local culture and are things about how people treat each other and things about how they talk about their clients and their ideology and so on. You should ask yourself whether you think that you would be a immune from a slippery slope under those conditions. And, you know, I don't have evidence for that but I think it would be all hard to imagine that all of us who are good right now would not have a chance of being bad for the wrong conditions.

(SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) ARIELY: So, like we usually do, I decided to do a simple experiment - and here's how it went. If you were in the experiment I would pass you a sheet of paper with 20 simple math problems that everybody could solve but they wouldn't give you enough time. When the five minutes were over I would say, pass me the sheets of paper and I'll pay you a dollar per question. People did this, I would pay people four dollars for their task - on average, people would solve four problems. Other people I would tempt to cheat. I would pass the sheet of paper, when the five minutes are over I would say, please shred the piece of paper, put the little pieces in your pocket or in your backpack and tell me how many questions you got correctly. People now solved seven questions on average. Now it wasn't as if there was a few bad apples - a few people who cheated a lot. Instead, what we saw is a lot of people who cheat a little bit. Now in economic theory cheating is very a simple cost-benefit analysis. You say, what's the probability of being caught, how much do I stand to gain from cheating and how much punishment would I get if I get caught. And you weigh these options out, you do the simple cost-benefit analysis and you decide whether it's worthwhile to commit the crime or not. So we try to test this. For some people, we varied how much money they could get away with - how much money they could steal. We paid them 10 cents per correct question, 50 cents, $1, $5, $10 per correct question. You would expect that as the amount of money on the table increases people would cheat more but in fact it wasn't the case. We got a lot of people cheating but still by a little bit. What about the probability of being caught? Some people shredded half the people paper so there was some evidence left, some people shredded the whole sheet of paper. Some people shredded everything, went out of the room and paid themselves in the ball of money that had over $100. You would expect that as the probability of being caught goes down people would cheat more but again this was not the case. Again, a lot of people cheated by just a little bit and they were unsensitive to these economic incentives. So it's said if people are not sensitive to the economical rational theory explanations to these forces what could be going on? And we thought maybe what is happening is that there are two forces. At one hand we all want to look ourselves in the mirror and feel good about ourselves, so we don't want to cheat. On the other hand, we could cheat a little bit and still feel good about ourselves. So maybe what is happening is that there's a level of cheating we can't go over but we can still benefit from cheating at a low degree as long as it doesn't change our impressions about ourselves. We call this like a personal fudge factor. Now how would you test a personal fudge factor? Initially we said, what can we do to shrink the fudge factor? So we got people to the lab and we said, we have two tasks for you today. First we asked half the people to recall either 10 books they read in high school or to recall the 10 Commandments and then we tempted them with cheating. Turns out the people who try to recall the 10 Commandments, given the opportunity to cheat, did not cheat at all. It wasn't that the more religious people, the people who remembered the Commandments, cheated less and the religious people, the people who couldn't remember almost any Commandments, cheated more - the moment people thought about trying to recall the 10 Commandments they stop cheating. Now 10 Commandments is something that is hard to bring into the education system so we said, why don't we get people to sign the honor code. So we got people to sign, I understand that these short survey falls under the MIT honor code, then they shredded it, no cheating whatsoever. And this is particularly interesting because MIT doesn't have an honor code. (LAUGHTER) RAZ: That's amazing. So when you introduce, like, an element of moral accountability like signing an honor code the students are less likely to cheat? ARIELY: Yes. So it's basically all about what are you thinking about. Now I don't think this affect last very long. Right, it's not as if we can get people to recite the 10 Commandments once a week and they'll be honest for the whole week. But at least it tells something about the moment it reminds it. And saying that at the moment you can get people to think more deeply about honesty, to be more attentive, it does change your own understanding of what's right and wrong and your ability to rationalize in that moment. It's almost like an anti-rationalization mechanism to think about morality in this way. RAZ: Have you ever, like, taken some printer paper home, like, just paper home to use in your home printer? ARIELY: Oh yeah. Of course but I can justify that very easily. RAZ: But that's not really cheating or being deceitful is it? ARIELY: Actually I'm being helpful. I get to work more at home. RAZ: Exactly. ARIELY: What do you mean? RAZ: But why is that seen as bad behavior? ARIELY: Well I think the thing is that we have this capacity to rationalize all kinds of behaviors like taking paper home. But if it was money and we said, would I take money from the office to buy paper for my home printer I think you would think about it very differently. RAZ: Because that's wrong. ARIELY: That stealing. RAZ: That stealing. ARIELY: Yeah. But if the same thing is framed as something else like a pencil or a piece of paper or something like that all of a sudden we can think about it very differently. And maybe the word think is a bit strange because we basically don't think about it and by not thinking about it very clearly we're basically allowing ourselves to misbehave and still not think of ourselves as bad people. RAZ: Do you assume that everybody you meet or encounter is a cheater in some ways? ARIELY: Well I think of this as human I don't think it's a cheater. But in the same way that we have a hard time, you know, not overeating and saving money and all of those things but dishonesty is also different in a sense that we teach our kids to lie. You know, nobody tell their kids that when they grow up they should always say, honey you look terrible in that dress - right? In the social realm we do understand that people have some benefit from dishonesty and it's an important lubricant for society. But then people moved to the business world and while I want my wife to care about my feelings I don't want my accountant to care about my feelings. Think about something else what happens if you're at a company and some of your friends are misbehaving and now you have a conflict between your friendship, your loyalty to them, your loyal to the company and honesty. RAZ: Which brings us back to 2001 to. . . (SOUNDBITE OF NEWS BROADCAST) UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: One of the most stunning collapses in U. S. corporate history. RAZ: And to Dan's friend John Perry Barlow. ARIELY: He basically said he didn't see anything going bad. RAZ: Now Dan started all his research with one question. And the question was are there just a few really bad apples or their lots and lots of kind of bad apples. But what if there isn't a huge difference between the two. Like, what if the worst of the worst start out like you and me? So for the past two years Dan's been trying to figure out the answer to that question. He's been interviewing some of these really big cheaters. ARIELY: And what they did at the end is just incomprehensible and you say, I can't possibly see myself behaving this way. RAZ: Yeah. ARIELY: But then you look at the details and you look at step one and step one was often innocent and not selfish at all. It was to help other people. It is really this slippery slope of taking one step often for something that at the moment people think is for a good cause. RAZ: I mean, I think that most of us have a limit, right? We have some kind of limit in our minds and I mean that slippery slope cannot apply to everyone. ARIELY: So of course I don't know if it applies to everybody. So the first thing to recognize is I think the ability to rationalize some dishonesty is within us all. On top of that now there's a question of which of us would be able to just cheat a little bit from time to time and which ones of us would be able to go into a slippery slope. Let's assume that you admit to that from time to time you're less than perfectly honest but you've never a been onto the slippery slope and, you know, you go and you get a job - let's say a banker at Goldman Sachs. And there are things about the local culture and are things about how people treat each other and things about how they talk about their clients and their ideology and so on. You should ask yourself whether you think that you would be a immune from a slippery slope under those conditions. And, you know, I don't have evidence for that but I think it would be all hard to imagine that all of us who are good right now would not have a chance of being bad for the wrong conditions.

All this technology has made lying so much easier. JEFF HANCOCK: For the first time in human history we can lie to each other about where we are, who we are, who we're with, what we're doing. RAZ: This is Jeff Hancock. He's a professor of psychology at Cornell. And he studies how people lie on the Internet. HANCOCK: Before when we talked to each other we had to be in the same room at the exact same time. And that's the crux of the paradox that we see. So it would seem that now that I can lie about all those things and I can do it without you seeing my face and any of my vocal tones or any of my body movements, that we should see a lot more lying. And I think it's wrong. RAZ: OK. So this all might seem completely counterintuitive, right? But it turns out that the Internet might be keeping us honest. Here's Jeff's take from the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)HANCOCK: Now let's put aside the online anonymous sex chat rooms, which I'm sure none of you have been in. I can assure you there's deception there. And let's put aside the Nigerian prince who's emailed you about getting the 43 million out of the country. (LAUGHTER)HANCOCK: Let's forget about that guy too. Let's focus on the conversations between our friends and our family and our coworkers and our loved ones - those are the conversation that really matter. What does technology do to deception with those folks? One of the studies we do are called diary studies in which we asked people to record all of their conversations and all their lies for seven days. And what we can do then is then calculate how many lies took place per conversation within a medium. And the finding that we get that surprises people the most is that email is the most honest of those three media. And it really throws people for a loop because we think, woah - there's no non-verbal cues, so why don't you lie more? The phone, in contrast, the most lies. Again and again and again we see the phone as the device that people lie on the most. RAZ: So, I  mean, you would think that, like, email would be the easiest way to sort of mislead somebody right or to lie to them? And you're saying that this is the most honest form of communication? HANCOCK: Right. It is really amazing - that being able to see the person doesn't improve your ability to detect deception. And this is really surprising to a lot of people. It was surprising to me. But it's been shown again and again and again that we don't really rely on non-verbal cues to tell if someone's lying. So the fact that those go away doesn't make email that much more difficult or easy to lie in. The reason that email I think is more honest - and again we're not talking about spam or any of that - but in our conversations with family, friends, coworkers we leave a record. We provide the recipient of the lie with the a record of the lie and that is not good for deception. RAZ: The irony is is that as we have all these, like, different avenues, like, in different places where we can lie it is actually a lot harder because you basically, like, you triangulate. Like, if you lie there's a good chance that somebody will be able to call you out on it because so many more people are exposed to that lie or that slight exaggeration about something. HANCOCK: Exactly right. I think that in all the ways that technology can on the surface seem like it will facilitate deception, they can't see me, I can call from anywhere, I can say anything I want, technology allows for all of that but at the same time it provides all these other tools for detecting deception in ways that 10, 20, 30 years ago we never would've thought about. But in addition to that, like you said, we have all these other tools. So Google - just think of the power that Google provides. Now imagine a Google search algorithm 20 years from now and the kinds of things and information it'll be able to parse and go through and surface for us. So this is one of the reasons when people say, well I think we're lying a lot more now and technology's a big reason for it - that's one of the reasons I just think that that's wrong. And I think that technology allows us to lie in some ways and we're certainly going to adapt and evolve our deception. But technology provides a lot of other constraints on how and when we lie. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)HANCOCK: What does that mean? What's the next big idea from that? Well, as a social scientist now I can look at all those words that use to, for millennia, disappear. I can look at lies that before were said and then gone. So one thing that we did, I'll give you an example of looking at the language, is we paid people to write some fake reviews. One of these reviews is fake, the person never was at the James Hotel. The other review is real, the person stayed there. Now your task now is to decide which review is fake. HANCOCK: So in one of the reviews it's a person talking about who they were there with. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN 1: My husband and I stayed at the James Chicago Hotel for our anniversary. The place is fantastic. HANCOCK: And they talked about that they went shopping and that the hotel is really lovely. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN 1: Staff very attentive and wonderful. HANCOCK: Really, really beautiful rooms. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN 1: We will definitely be back to Chicago and will sure be back to the James Chicago. HANCOCK: In the second one. . . UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN 2: I have stayed at many hotels traveling for both business and pleasure and I can honestly say. . . HANCOCK: They don't really say who they were there with. They talk a little bit more about what the room looked like. . . UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN 2: The rooms are modern and very comfortable. HANCOCK: And instead of saying that they went shopping they say that the shopping was about a mile away. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN 2: Highly recommend it to both business travelers and couples. HANCOCK: And people have a really hard time telling which one is real. In fact, your listeners may be trying to decide well was it the first one where they talked about being there with a husband or the second one where they talked about the size of the room? RAZ: And which one was it? HANCOCK: The first one was fake. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)HANCOCK: Let me highlight a couple of things here. In the fake review. The first is that liars tend to think about narrative, they make up a story - who and what happened. And that's what happened here. Our fake reviewers talked about who they were with and what they were doing. They also used the first-person singular, I, way more than the people that actually stayed there. They were inserting themselves into the hotel review kind of trying to convince you they were there. In contrast, the people that wrote the reviews that were actually there, their bodies actually entered the physical space, they talked a lot more about spacial information. They said how big the bathroom was or they said, you know, here's how far shopping is from the hotel. We believe that every lie now, every type of lie, fake hotel reviews, fake shoe reviews, your girlfriend cheating on you with text messaging, those are all different lies - they're going to have different patterns of language. But because everything is recorded now, we can look at all those kinds of lies. The next big thing for me, the next big idea, we can find by going way back in history to the origins of language. Most linguists agree that we started speaking somewhere between 50,000 and 100,000 years ago. That's a long time ago. A lot of humans have lived since then. We've been talking I guess about fires in caves and saber tooth tigers - I don't know what they talked about. But they were doing a lot of talking. And like I said there's a lot of humans evolving, speaking. About 100 billion people in fact. What's important though is that writing only immerged about 5,000 years ago. So what that means is that all the people before there was any writing - every word that they ever said, every utterance, disappeared, no trace, evanescent, gone. So we've been evolving to talk in a way in which there is no record. HANCOCK: So I think deception involved to disappear. And we're in this really amazing, interesting time where, yes, we can lie about many more things. People can't hear our voice or see our face but we leave a record and that record is something brand-new and I think it's something that deception is currently having to adapt to. RAZ: Jeff Hancock, he studies deception in psychology at Cornell University. His full talk is at ted. npr. org.

I'm Guy Raz, and on the show today - ideas about why we lie and why most of us believe those lies. Can you usually tell when you're being lied to? PAMELA MEYER: Well, this is the problem of lie spotting. . . RAZ: This is Pamela Meyer. She trains people on how to spot liars. MEYER: Shall we do a little test to see? RAZ: Yeah. MEYER: OK. Are you right-handed or left-handed? RAZ: Right. MEYER: OK. Hold your dominant hand up. It doesn't matter if you're right-handed or left-handed, anybody can do this. Hold your dominant hand up. Draw a capital Q on your forehead. RAZ: OK. I've done it. MEYER: OK. Did you draw the tail of the Q towards your left or your right shoulder? RAZ: My right shoulder. MEYER: OK. So that means you're a bad liar, the science shows that that indicates that you're a low self-monitor. High self-monitors tend to draw the capital Q so the person facing them can actually see it - with it down and towards the left. And we know that high self-monitors are better observers of other people, they're more perceptive, they're also better liars because they can perceive how others perceive them more accurately. RAZ: So you've just confirmed that I am a bad liar because I drew the Q that way? MEYER: Well, no. That's certainly not proof but it is an interesting way to kind of get a sense of the way you perceive others and the way you perceive the world. RAZ: And as Pamela explained on the TED stage we are in fact born to lie. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)MEYER: It starts really, really early - how early? Well babies will fake a cry, pause, wait to see who's coming and then go right back to crying. (LAUGHTER)MEYER: One-year-olds learn concealment, five-year-olds lie outright - they manipulate via flattery. Nine-year-olds - masters of the cover-up. By the time you enter college, you're going to lie to your mom in one out of every five interactions. By the time we enter this work world and we're breadwinners, we enter a world that's just cluttered with spam, fake, digital-friends, partisan media, ingenious identity thieves, world-class ponzi schemers - a deception epidemic. In short, what one author calls a post-truth society. Lying's complex but we're covertly for it in ways that our society has sanctioned for centuries and centuries and centuries. It's as old as breathing. Think Dante, Shakespeare, the Bible, news of the world. What do you do? Well there steps we can take to navigate our way through the morass. There are good liars and there are bad liars. There are no real original liars. We all make the same mistakes, we all use the same techniques. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to show you patterns of deception and then we're going to look at the hotspots and see if we can find them ourselves. We're going to start with speech. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH)PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON: I want you to listen to me. I'm going to say this again. I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Ms. Lewinsky. I never asked anybody to lie, not a single time, never. These allegations are false. RAZ: I remember seeing that and I thought, yeah, OK, of course, convinced. MEYER: Well he was very, very convincing. Of course Bill Clinton is one of the most convincing politicians and persuasive politicians we've ever seen in modern history. But he did demonstrate three of the great indicators of deception on the verbal side. First of all he said, did not. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH)CLINTON: I did not have. MEYER: So that's what's called a non-contracted denial. Did not versus didn't, could not versus couldn't. And liars often unconsciously resort to formal rather than informal language. He also said, that woman. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH)CLINTON: Sexual relations with that woman. MEYER: That's what we call distancing language. Now the other thing he did is he said. . . (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH)CLINTON: Ms. Lewinsky. MEYER: Now Bill Clinton obviously couldn't say, hey I never had sex outside my marriage in my life. So clearly he could not issue a categorical denial. But still it's a great example because, you know, the liars going to say, I did not take 20 from the drawer. The truth tellers going to say, are you kidding, I never stole anything in my life. The categorical denial tends to be associated with honesty whereas the narrowed, specific denial tends to be associated with deception. RAZ: So we look at this clip and I wonder, I just thought because I just saw your TED talk again for, like, the seventh time or something - so, so that was a lie, it was like the third time. MEYER: That's OK. RAZ: I'm am not - there's going to be no lying here. . . MEYER: I don't think you're lying. RAZ: I've seen your TED talk three times. MEYER: Cool. RAZ: Fully once and then the other two times in segments. I don't want to give you to give you the impression that I watched it three times because that's not exactly how I watched them. MEYER: OK. Thank you for providing that, what we call, inappropriate amount of detail. (SOUNDBITE FROM TED TALK)MEYER: Lying is a cooperative act. Think about it. A lie has no power whatsoever by its mere utterance. Its power emerges when someone else agrees to believe the lie. Now not all lies are harmful sometimes we're willing participants in deception for the sake of social dignity. We say, nice song, you don't look fat in that, no. Or we say, you know, I just fished that email out of my spam folder, I'm so sorry. RAZ: So, I mean, in situations like that we actually want to be lied to? MEYER: Yes. I think we have a kind of ambivalent relationship with the truth. RAZ: Yeah. MEYER: So for example let's say you really wished you had a lot more money - you're much more likely to be susceptible to the person who's trying to essentially sell you a financial scam. Or let's say you wished you were much better looking - you're going to be much more susceptible to the person who says, you know, you look gorgeous today. So for example when we do training sometimes we'll put people in pairs and we'll say, tell the biggest lie you can think of to the person across from you. Often times, what emerges is this absolutely fascinating conversation between two people because the biggest lie that you can think of is very often in that area of striving where you wish you could be something that you're actually not. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)MEYER: Lying is an attempt to bridge that gap, to connect our wishes and our fantasies about who we wish we were, how we wish we could be, with what we're really like. And boy are we willing to fill in those gaps in our lives with lies. On a given day, studies show that you may be lied to anywhere from 10 to 200 times. Now granted many of those are white lies. But in another study it showed that strangers lied three times within the first 10 minutes of meeting each other. We lie more to strangers than we lie to co-workers. Extroverts lie more than introverts. Men lie eight times more about themselves than they do other people. Women lie more to protect other people. RAZ: Have you ever been convinced that somebody was lying but then found out later, that then the evidence really showed, that the person was in fact telling the truth? Like, did that ever happen to you? MEYER: It hasn't happened to me but it happens to a lot of people. And it's a very, very important question because it's not a parlor trick. And often times people take lie spotting techniques and they think that they've learned them instantly and they go out and they wrongly accuse people and that's a very serious thing to do. A real process of figuring out if somebody is lying involves preparing, having a conversation, observing them carefully, going back, observing them again, there's so many things that you can miss. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)MEYER: Lie spotters rely on human tools. They know, as someone once said, character's who you are in the dark. And what's kind of interesting is that today we have so little darkness. Our world is lit up 24 hours a day, it's transparent. So one challenge we have is to remember - over sharing, that's not honesty. Our manic tweeting and texting can blind us to the fact that the subtleties of human decency, character, integrity - that's still what matters. That's always what's going to matter. So in this much noise of your world it might make sense for us to be just a little bit more explicit about our moral code, just a little bit more explicit - because you signal to everyone around you. You say, hey my world, our world, it's going to be an honest one. My world is going to be one where truth is strengthened and falsities is recognized and marginalized. And when you do that, the ground around you starts to shift just a little bit and that's the truth. Thank you. (APPLAUSE)RAZ: Pamela Meyer, lie spotter. Check out her entire TED Talk at ted. npr. org. So what do you think about my hair? MEYER: Your hair is great, it looks fabulous today. I swear to God on my mother's grave. It looks great. That's what we would call a religious reference combined with over emphasizing one's truthfulness. RAZ: So you're lying? MEYER: I'm lying. RAZ: OK. MEYER: No. Your hair really does look good. It does look good. RAZ: Thanks. GUY RAZ, HOST:  It's the TED Radio Hour from NPR. I'm Guy Raz, and on the show today - ideas about why we lie and why most of us believe those lies. Can you usually tell when you're being lied to? PAMELA MEYER: Well, this is the problem of lie spotting. . . RAZ: This is Pamela Meyer. She trains people on how to spot liars. MEYER: Shall we do a little test to see? RAZ: Yeah. MEYER: OK. Are you right-handed or left-handed? RAZ: Right. MEYER: OK. Hold your dominant hand up. It doesn't matter if you're right-handed or left-handed, anybody can do this. Hold your dominant hand up. Draw a capital Q on your forehead. RAZ: OK. I've done it. MEYER: OK. Did you draw the tail of the Q towards your left or your right shoulder? RAZ: My right shoulder. MEYER: OK. So that means you're a bad liar, the science shows that that indicates that you're a low self-monitor. High self-monitors tend to draw the capital Q so the person facing them can actually see it - with it down and towards the left. And we know that high self-monitors are better observers of other people, they're more perceptive, they're also better liars because they can perceive how others perceive them more accurately. RAZ: So you've just confirmed that I am a bad liar because I drew the Q that way? MEYER: Well, no. That's certainly not proof but it is an interesting way to kind of get a sense of the way you perceive others and the way you perceive the world. RAZ: And as Pamela explained on the TED stage we are in fact born to lie. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) MEYER: It starts really, really early - how early? Well babies will fake a cry, pause, wait to see who's coming and then go right back to crying. (LAUGHTER) MEYER: One-year-olds learn concealment, five-year-olds lie outright - they manipulate via flattery. Nine-year-olds - masters of the cover-up. By the time you enter college, you're going to lie to your mom in one out of every five interactions. By the time we enter this work world and we're breadwinners, we enter a world that's just cluttered with spam, fake, digital-friends, partisan media, ingenious identity thieves, world-class ponzi schemers - a deception epidemic. In short, what one author calls a post-truth society. Lying's complex but we're covertly for it in ways that our society has sanctioned for centuries and centuries and centuries. It's as old as breathing. Think Dante, Shakespeare, the Bible, news of the world. What do you do? Well there steps we can take to navigate our way through the morass. There are good liars and there are bad liars. There are no real original liars. We all make the same mistakes, we all use the same techniques. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to show you patterns of deception and then we're going to look at the hotspots and see if we can find them ourselves. We're going to start with speech. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON: I want you to listen to me. I'm going to say this again. I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Ms. Lewinsky. I never asked anybody to lie, not a single time, never. These allegations are false. RAZ: I remember seeing that and I thought, yeah, OK, of course, convinced. MEYER: Well he was very, very convincing. Of course Bill Clinton is one of the most convincing politicians and persuasive politicians we've ever seen in modern history. But he did demonstrate three of the great indicators of deception on the verbal side. First of all he said, did not. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) CLINTON: I did not have. MEYER: So that's what's called a non-contracted denial. Did not versus didn't, could not versus couldn't. And liars often unconsciously resort to formal rather than informal language. He also said, that woman. (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) CLINTON: Sexual relations with that woman. MEYER: That's what we call distancing language. Now the other thing he did is he said. . . (SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH) CLINTON: Ms. Lewinsky. MEYER: Now Bill Clinton obviously couldn't say, hey I never had sex outside my marriage in my life. So clearly he could not issue a categorical denial.

Those three countries are Liberia, Myanmar and the United States of America. Although to be fair, both Liberia and Myanmar are taking steps to go metric. Not to say the United States does not make use of the metric system. The official U. S. government definition of a foot is 0. 3048 meter. But if the length of the foot is based on the meter, NPR science correspondent Joe Palca wondered, what is the length of the meter based on? That's the latest question he's posing as part of his series, Joe's Big Idea. JOE PALCA, BYLINE: The 18th century is famously known as the Age of Reason. Disorder was upsetting. And over in France, there was plenty of disorder. KEN ALDER: The world of measurement in 18th century France and throughout Europe, at that time, was one of mind-boggling diversity. PALCA: That's Northwestern University historian of science, Ken Alder. He's a good person to talk to about how the meter got its length because he wrote the book about it, literally. It's called \"The Measure Of All Things. \"ALDER: Historians have estimated that, within France alone, there were 250,000 different units of measurement in use at the time. PALCA: So this is a big problem. Alder says there was a simple solution to the problem. ALDER: Which was to take the Parisian measures and expand them to the whole country. But a group of scientists or savant, as they would've been called in those days, had a different idea. And they wanted to base the unit on nature, a unit that would be the same for everybody, because nature was the same for everybody. PALCA: So the savant did what savant do - they argued and debated and discussed - trying to decide what aspect of nature they should use to base their unit of measure on. ALDER: The proposal that ended up sort of winning the day was a proposal that based the measure on the size of the world itself. PALCA: A meter would be defined as one 10-millionth of the distance from the North Pole to the equator - trouble is, no one knew exactly what was the distance from the North Pole to the equator. So in 1792, an expedition was mounted. Now, going all the way to the Pole and the equator seemed a bit too ambitious, so the idea was to measure the distance between two cities - Dunkirk in France and Barcelona in Spain - that were on a straight line directly north-south of one another. By knowing the exact latitude of the cities, the savant could use the distance between them to extrapolate the distance from the Pole to the equator. The job of making the measurements went to two astronomers named Delambre and Mechain. Delambre headed north and Mechain went south. ALDER: The expedition is originally expected to be done within a year. In the end, it takes them seven. PALCA: Why so long? ALDER: For one thing, war breaks out between Revolutionary France and the rest of Europe. And who are these strange men - climbing into high towers and fortifications and churches, peering out into the distance with these strange scientific instruments? And they're repeatedly hauled down from these towers, thrown in jail and, at times, threatened with death. PALCA: Eventually, Mechain and Delambre delivered their results to the savant. The savant spent a year doing calculations. And in the end, they create a bar with the calculated the length. ALDER: Made out of platinum that will serve as the actual embodiment of that physical standard, the meter. PALCA: So that's the story. Well, not quite. Turns out the savants and the surveyors made some errors. And Mechain even secretly redid some of his measurements, got different numbers and didn't tell anybody. So in the end, that bar of platinum is close to one 10-millionth of the distance from the North Pole to equator. But Alder says scientists now know, it's short by two-tenths of a millimeter. Or as we Americans, and our friends in Myanmar and Liberia, would say around eight-thousandths of an inch. ALDER: And the irony here is that, in a sense, they could have started out by simply creating a bar and calling it the standard meter. And indeed, some people from the very beginning had suggested - really, why was it necessary to go so far to find what lay so near? Why not simply declare, yo, it's a meter. PALCA: Here it is. ALDER: (Laughing) Yeah, exactly. PALCA: So even though it isn't exactly one 10-millionth of the distance from the North Pole to the equator, the length of that bar is what the world first knew as a meter. Joe Palca, NPR news.

That's enough to kill a person. This eel is perhaps the most famous electric fish, but there are hundreds of others, too, that produce weaker electric fields. NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce reports on a new study that shows the surprising way in which these fish became electrified. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE, BYLINE: Michael Sussman studies electric eels in his lab at the University of Wisconsin Madison. He says a six foot long electric eel is basically a six inch fish attached to a five and a half foot cattle prod. MICHAEL SUSSMAN: So all of the intestines and the stomach and all that stuff is right close to the head. And the rest of the electric eel is an electric organ. It's just a beautiful tissue. GREENFIELDBOYCE: The tissue of this organ is a lot like muscle, but it can't contract. Its cells are big and have all sorts of features that let them pump out electric city without shocking the fish. The cells are stacked together like batteries in a flashlight, and they all fire simultaneously. It's about 100 volts per foot of eel. Sussman says he's been shocked by eels a couple of feet long. SUSSMAN: And it's kind of like putting your finger in an electric outlet. You know, it's very unpleasant, and you kind of pull your finger away. GREENFIELDBOYCE: A shock like this can stun or kill prey. Other electric fish use weaker fields to navigate through murky waters or to talk to each other in a weird, staticy way. (SOUNDBITE OF STATIC)JASON GALLANT: That's an interaction between a breeding male and a breeding female. So they're electrically singing to each other, actually. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Jason Gallant is an electric fish expert at Michigan State University. He takes their electrical energy and converts it to sound. (SOUNDBITE OF BEEPING)GALLANT: Each fish has kind of a distinctive type of sound, like the species itself. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Now, it's amazing that evolution invented an organ for making electricity even once. But in fact, evolution did it six separate times in completely different fish. How is that possible? Gallant, Sussman and a bunch of other scientists wanted to know, so they analyzed all the genes of the electric eel then also looked at gene activity in other electric fishes from unrelated families. What they discovered was shocking. GALLANT: They're using the same genetic tools to build their electric organs in each lineage independently. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Again and again, evolution used the same set of about 30 genes. GALLANT: It seems like there are limited ways to build an electric organ, and that's sort of a surprising find because you wouldn't necessarily have expected that. GREENFIELDBOYCE: The findings are described in the journal, Science. Lindsay Traeger works in Sussman's lab. She says one dream is to use this new information to create an electric organ in a creature that doesn't normally have one. LINDSAY TRAEGER: I definitely think that it's a possibility in the future. I'm not sure how far off it is, but it's probably closer than we can imagine. GREENFIELDBOYCE: She and her colleagues have been tossing around some possibilities. Maybe people could have little electric organs to power medical devices. TRAEGER: Perhaps one application of something like this could be creating a bio-battery for the use of pacemakers - actually create a bio-battery in this person's body so we no longer have to go in and replace this battery when it's gets old. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Before that, of course, researchers would have to do a lot more work. One major step would to be taken an ordinary lab fish and tweak its genes to make it electric.

TRAEGER: Perhaps one application of something like this could be creating a bio-battery for the use of pacemakers - actually create a bio-battery in this person's body so we no longer have to go in and replace this battery when it's gets old. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Before that, of course, researchers would have to do a lot more work. One major step would to be taken an ordinary lab fish and tweak its genes to make it electric.

S. Yosemite National Park is celebrating a 150th anniversary of the law that preserved it. In 1864, Abraham Lincoln signed the Yosemite Grant Act, which planted the seeds for the National Park system. For the last century and a half, visitors have been enjoying the natural wonders of the Yosemite and California's Sierra Nevada, from Half Dome to the giant sequoia grove. But 4 million visitors a year have made preservation difficult. Sasha Khokha of member station KQED has this report from Yosemite. SASHA KHOKHA, BYLINE: It's nearing midnight and the full moon is bathing North America's tallest waterfall in its milky glow. A few photographers have timed their visit to Yosemite so they can catch a glimpse of a rare phenomenon that's only visible when the moonlight catches the mist at the base of Yosemite Falls. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: That is really good. Oh, that's great. MARK ZBOROWSKI: We're here taking the moonbow, which is basically a rainbow at night. KHOKHA: Photographer Mark Zborowski explains that the naked eye just sees a thin, silvery band of moonbow, but a long exposure with a camera can capture the color. ZBOROWSKI: Just a spectacular view, you know, you look up and you can see the ridges up high and the stars. It fills your eyes, you know, it gives you a lot to feed off of. KHOKHA: Photography, in fact, has been key to Yosemite's allure. Historians think it may have helped convince President Abraham Lincoln to preserve a place he'd never visited. DEAN SHENK: The first photographer who came to the Mariposa Grove in 1859 took a picture of the Grizzly Giant from the angle that we're looking at today. KHOKHA: Ranger and park historian Dean Shenk walks towards one of Yosemite's most famous trees. SHENK: The Grizzly Giant is in the neighborhood of the size of the Leaning Tower of Pisa. KHOKHA: This grove of giant sequoias in Yosemite's iconic valley became the first federally protected wilderness areas when Lincoln signed the grant on June 30th, 1864. SHENK: In the midst of our country's civil war, with all the bloodshed, all of the battle, all the anxiety, many of us would like to think that he took a moment and perhaps shook his head, or smiled, in just perhaps a sigh of pleasure. KHOKHA: Shenk compares the idea of protecting these lands to the seed of a giant sequoia, which is as tiny as an oat flake. SHENK: And so that seed planted by Lincoln's signature has expanded to the National Park system throughout America. KHOKHA: But, Shenk points out, even those who urge Congress and Lincoln to preserve Yosemite warned that tourism had to be managed carefully. That includes Fredrick Law Olmstead, the landscape architect who helped design New York's Central Park and helped oversee the Yosemite land-grant. SHENK: Not only did he predict the millions of people in the future, but he also said, and so we must be aware of the capricious damage that one visitor might make, and then multiply it by the millions. HELEN HOGAN COATS: I live right here on the highway that goes to Yosemite. So I see these buses go and go. KHOKHA: Helen Hogan Coats was born in Yosemite in 1927. She's one of the oldest surviving Native Americans to grow up in the park. COATS: And I tell my husband, there they go again. They're tromping down my ground again. They're just tromping her down. I said, why don't they give her a rest? They're making it into a Disneyland. KHOKHA: Coats worked in the hotel laundry, washing sheets and as a babysitter for the children of Ansel Adams, the famed Yosemite photographer. She says she hopes visitors coming to commemorate Yosemite's history will stop for a while to think about what this place was like before white settlers arrived a century and a half ago. COATS: I mean, don't just come in there and have a good time, you know, celebrating. You got to have a little spiritual way at looking at the rocks and the trees. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: All aboard. All aboard. (SOUNDBITE OF ENGINE STARTING)KHOKHA: Soon, the Mariposa Grove of giant sequoias will be a little less like Disneyland. The trams that snake through the trees on paved roads and the parking lots, built right on top of some of the Sequoia's delicate roots, will soon be removed. So will the gift shop. National Park officials plan to restore the Grove as part of the anniversary celebration. Tourists will have to walk through the trees, much as the first visitors to Yosemite did 150 years ago.

Boy or girl? Will they be healthy? Advances in genetic testing allow parents to know more than ever. But current tests generally target a single medical condition. It's only recently that the genes of a fetus have been completely genotyped. Razib Khan, the father of a new baby boy, took it upon himself, out of curiosity, to learn his son's DNA code before he was born. Razib is a blogger and a Ph. D. candidate studying evolutionary genetics at the University of California, Davis. He joined us from member station Capital Public Radio in Sacramento. I asked him why decipher his unborn son's entire genetic makeup? RAZIB KHAN: Basically, the most important thing in my life, ever, has been my children. And so when we knew we were going to have another child, I wanted to know as much as possible about that child. And the sequence basically took that to its logical limits, in terms of genetics. GONYEA: How easy or how difficult was it for you to make this happen? KHAN: There's really not a roadmap for this for new parents or expectant parents. And so I faced some opposition, but, frankly, more confusion, in terms of people who didn't really understand why I would want to do this or, you know, what the protocols were for getting the tissue back or getting the sequencing done and this sort of thing. GONYEA: But as you know, the gathering of this kind of information is controversial. Some parents might see the results, and it might force them into some very difficult decisions. It could, for example, lead some couples to maybe abort a fetus based on what they see. KHAN: So what I would say to that is, I got his whole genome, right? That's the big thing. That's the revolutionary thing, I suppose. But in the United States today, there are, I think, probably on the order of, like, tens of thousands - perhaps, hundreds of thousands now getting prenatal testing for things like Down syndrome. And, you know, from what I have heard, about 90 percent of those fetuses are terminated. So that's already happening. Like, what I did here doesn't change that. GONYEA: So I understand that you learned a lot. Give me some sense of what your son's DNA code told you? KHAN: So a lot of it was aesthetic traits or personal traits. So, for example, you know, my son has a reduced sensitivity to bitter tastes, which was something that I was extremely interested in because that's correlated with children not being picky eaters. And my daughter's the same way. So I was happy about that, you know, in terms of vegetables and whatnot. There is a gene that is associated with reduced body odor, for example. And he actually happens to have both appropriate copies. You know, that's my prediction. GONYEA: Razib Khan is the father who sequenced his son's DNA. Thanks for speaking with us. KHAN: Thank you.

We'd like to turn now to a new initiative from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration - NASA. NASA wants to know how their technologies can best be applied commercially and they are asking you for ideas. Daniel Lockney is here to tell us more about this. He is NASA's technology transfer program executive and he was nice enough to stop by our Washington, D. C. , studios. Welcome. Thanks for joining us. DANIEL LOCKNEY: Absolutely. Thanks for having me. MARTIN: I wonder if people remember how much NASA technology we actually use as consumers. Can you give us a couple of examples? LOCKNEY: Sure. The camera in your cell phone was developed by our researchers at the Jet Propulsion Lab in Caltech. Infant formula - 95 percent of the baby food sold in the world has an additive that we discovered - the omega-3-omega-6 combination - believed to be important in the development of the brain and the eyes, fatty tissues. We're the first to synthesize it - long-duration space flight experiments. MARTIN: And you were telling me that the shape of the modern truck or the modern semi is a result of some NASA aerodynamics - you were telling me that. But you were also telling me that I was wrong about Tang. NASA actually doesn't get credit for Tang or Velcro. LOCKNEY: Yeah, or Teflon. MARTIN: Or Teflon? LOCKNEY: All of these things were popularized by the space program but invented elsewhere. And we're not opposed to getting ideas from elsewhere. MARTIN: Well, that's the idea here. So now you're teaming up with a company called Edison Nation. What kinds of things are you looking for? LOCKNEY: So this is one of our open innovation projects where we're crowdsourcing. We develop something - perhaps it's a sensor, an optics configuration or new metal. In this instance, with Edison Nation, it's actually a device that monitors brain waves and provides feedback to a machine. So we develop technologies. And we know what we're going to use them for but we often don't know how else they can be used. So we're asking the public through this Edison Nation work and then also through a company called Marblar. And the idea is to tap into the untapped cognitive surplus - that people are online, you know, drawing pictures, captioning cat photographs and doing all of these otherwise creative things - perhaps we can get them to work for us, too. MARTIN: What exactly are you asking of people? What are you asking them to do? LOCKNEY: So it's almost like we've given them a blank sheet of paper and we said what can you make of this? And they would say I can make an airplane, I can make a hat, I can make a boat. But instead of a blank sheet of paper, we're actually handing them a technology. We're saying here's a device that has the following characteristics - what else can be done with it? Here's a foam that will get to a specific temperature, will rigidize at a specific rate, and it will get this hard and is this lightweight - what can you use it for? MARTIN: So I think a lot of people are familiar now with crowdsourcing and like Kickstarter - and for that matter an NPR fundraising campaign, right? And so you are looking to the public to fund something that they like. In this instance, the thing already exists so you're looking for - what - ideas on how it could be used? LOCKNEY: That's right. We're not asking for dollars. We're asking for clever ideas. And then the options spiral out from there. If someone who proposes an idea is interested in actually pursuing it for commercialization, they're more than welcome to and we'll work with them to do that. If they have an idea but the technology needs further RND - further development - we can help with that. If they just want to give the idea and say hey, somebody should do this then we can also pursue that as well. MARTIN: So this sounds so crass but what's in it for me? If I participate in this, what's in it for me? I understand that there is an answer to that question. There is something other than the pleasure of seeing your ideas come to life, that there's actually potentially royalties involved, right? LOCKNEY: Perhaps. So there's a way that this could be structured. There's so many different possibilities with it. First, if you just propose an idea you get the same gratification as if, you know, you captioned one of those funny cat photos and a bunch of people liked it. You get a bunch of thumbs-up on the Internet for it. So that's one end of the spectrum. On the other end of the spectrum, you could license technology, create your company around it and go off and you would actually receive dollars from sales. The royalty income is slightly different. That's dollars that come back to the government and we are the most generous agency in terms of what we give the inventors. So a large chunk - most of what first comes in from a licensing arrangement goes to the actual government inventor. The rest goes toward kind of routine patent maintenance fees and such. MARTIN: But you're saying that there is the opportunity for the sharing of commercial benefit. . . LOCKNEY: Absolutely. MARTIN: . . . As a consequence of this. This is not - I mean, getting a like is nice but you're talking about possibilities for kind of commercial remuneration as a consequence of - with participation in this - which was logical, right? Which - yeah. LOCKNEY: Absolutely. So we did a survey very recently - it went back over 10 years of companies that had taken our technologies and commercialized them - and found some pretty impressive results. Several, you know, tens of billions of dollars in increased revenue from companies that use our technology. Several hundred thousand lives saved as a result of incorporation of our technologies and consumer products. Jobs created - tens of thousands. MARTIN: Before we let you go, I wanted to ask about a couple of things - things that I think people do know that NASA does which is still space exploration. I wanted to ask you about NASA's Orion test fight scheduled for later this year. I understand that there's a new computer system involved. It's 25 times faster than the International Space Station computers and 4,000 times faster than its predecessors in the Apollo program. Tell me about that. I mean, is there any chance that this technology will make it into consumer projects? And of course, you know, I have to ask you about the flying saucer. I'm going to ask you to tell me about that. LOCKNEY: Sure, absolutely. So computers and software are an increasingly large portion of the technical work that we do. There's still a lot of hardware. There's still a lot of traditional RND. But we're finding software's increasingly important. As a matter of fact, just this year we released, for the first time, a complete NASA software catalog that we had talked about getting some of these ideas out to the public. With over 1,000 codes, all free, for secondary application. And these are business tools, design software - a whole line of everything we've ever done work in is now available for the public. MARTIN: And tell me about the flying saucer. And I'm using that term colloquially, of course. But NASA launched an experimental - I think - vehicle this weekend. Tell us about it - over Hawaii. So I guess the - I guess what a lot of people are seeing is if you thought you saw a flying saucer over Hawaii Saturday, you weren't crazy. So tell us what it was. LOCKNEY: It's the LDSD - the Low-Density Supersonic Decelerator. And the idea behind it is you produce enough drag for re-entering the atmosphere. In this instance, we're talking about the Martian atmosphere. You need to slow down the spacecraft before you can gently land it onto the surface. You know, you don't want to go careening into the surface of Mars after spending all that time to get there. Typically, we've been using the technology - a parachute technology that we developed during Viking Lander era. And it's the same thing that we used to get curiosity to slow down in 2012 for that landing. And the idea is that we would have larger, heavier spacecraft that need newer technologies - more advanced technologies to help slow them down. So instead of a parachute, it's kind of a long - almost like a blob - that's a flying saucer that will slow down the spacecraft before it reaches the atmosphere. MARTIN: And what will this allow? Why is this important? LOCKNEY: We'll have larger, heavier spacecraft from Mars. And the typical parachutes that we've been using in the past won't be able to sustain that landing. MARTIN: So it's an important milestone. LOCKNEY: The idea is to land humans on Mars in the next couple of decades. And this is an important next step. MARTIN: Daniel Lockney is NASA's technology transfer program executive. He was nice enough to stop by our Washington, D. C. , studios. Daniel Lockney, thanks so much for joining us.

But we're finding software's increasingly important. As a matter of fact, just this year we released, for the first time, a complete NASA software catalog that we had talked about getting some of these ideas out to the public. With over 1,000 codes, all free, for secondary application. And these are business tools, design software - a whole line of everything we've ever done work in is now available for the public. MARTIN: And tell me about the flying saucer. And I'm using that term colloquially, of course. But NASA launched an experimental - I think - vehicle this weekend. Tell us about it - over Hawaii. So I guess the - I guess what a lot of people are seeing is if you thought you saw a flying saucer over Hawaii Saturday, you weren't crazy. So tell us what it was. LOCKNEY: It's the LDSD - the Low-Density Supersonic Decelerator. And the idea behind it is you produce enough drag for re-entering the atmosphere. In this instance, we're talking about the Martian atmosphere. You need to slow down the spacecraft before you can gently land it onto the surface. You know, you don't want to go careening into the surface of Mars after spending all that time to get there. Typically, we've been using the technology - a parachute technology that we developed during Viking Lander era. And it's the same thing that we used to get curiosity to slow down in 2012 for that landing. And the idea is that we would have larger, heavier spacecraft that need newer technologies - more advanced technologies to help slow them down. So instead of a parachute, it's kind of a long - almost like a blob - that's a flying saucer that will slow down the spacecraft before it reaches the atmosphere. MARTIN: And what will this allow? Why is this important? LOCKNEY: We'll have larger, heavier spacecraft from Mars. And the typical parachutes that we've been using in the past won't be able to sustain that landing. MARTIN: So it's an important milestone. LOCKNEY: The idea is to land humans on Mars in the next couple of decades. And this is an important next step. MARTIN: Daniel Lockney is NASA's technology transfer program executive. He was nice enough to stop by our Washington, D. C. , studios. Daniel Lockney, thanks so much for joining us.

Well, today a trio of anthropologists has decided it is time to rewrite that narrative in a big way. As NPR's Christopher Joyce reports, they're bringing us a new take on how we became the creatures we are and what drove that process. CHRISTOPHER JOYCE, BYLINE: Anthropologists argue about the details of human evolution. But they generally agree that about 2 million years ago in Africa, the human lineage emerged. Anthropologist Rick Potts says the conventional wisdom is that much of Africa changed about then, from forest to dry savanna. Our ape-like ancestors had to adapt, so they evolved into something more like us. RICK POTTS: The traditional package of traits, includes elongated legs, large brain, culture - a whole variety of traits all were thought to have come together with the origin of the genus homo. We're saying, no, that's not the case. JOYCE: Potts is curator of human origins at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History. He and his collaborators have analyzed fossils discovered over the past few decades, and they say the human animal did not come together in one fell swoop. Anthropologist Leslie Aiello runs the Wenner-Gren foundation in New York. LESLIE AIELLO: What's different about it is the whole package that makes us human - long, linear bodies, very large body size, delayed growth and development for the kids - didn't evolve at the same time. JOYCE: Instead, these scientists say traits that made us human arose separately in a herky-jerky fashion. There were at least three different types of early humans running around in Africa then - each had different features. In a way, human evolution was like the development of the modern automobile. You can trace its various advancements back to their origins in the Model T, 1950s luxury cars, station wagons or hatchbacks. Potts argues also that what drove this piecemeal construction of humans wasn't a single event like the drying out of Africa. Instead, it was frequent climate changePOTTS: The kind of unpredictability - uncertainty in the environment - that was the evolutionary driver for the origin of larger body size and large brains, the use of tools. JOYCE: Potts says we did not evolve to adapt to any single change. Instead, we evolved the ability to adapt quickly to any new environment - wet to dry, cold to hot, whatever came down the pike. POTTS: I would say that the origin of our human lineage in fluctuating conditions led us to become versatile; we're versatilists, if you will. JOYCE: And our versatility is what makes us special. Potts and his colleagues lay all this out in the journal Science, where other anthropologists will likely line up to pick out the flaws. William Jungers at the State University of New York at Stony Brook says the group makes assumptions based on pretty fragmentary evidence, and he wonders why the super-adaptability of humans doesn't show up in other mammals which face the same climate fluctuations. That said, however. . . WILLIAM JUNGERS: I think this is an enormous undertaking to try to synthesize all this information, much of it in the last decade to be sure. And, you know, every new fossil you find sort of requires getting back to the drawing board. JOYCE: And in the case of modern evolution, the drawing on that board keeps getting more complex.

Scientists found vials of the deadly smallpox virus in an old storage room at an unsecured government lab outside Washington, D. C. The smallpox virus was declared eradicated from the world in 1980. It's supposed to be kept in only two places in the world - a high-security lab in Atlanta and another such lab in Russia. NPR's Geoff Brumfiel joins us now to tell us more. And Geoff, what happened? How did they find these vials of smallpox virus? GEOFF BRUMFIEL, BYLINE: On July 1, scientists on the campus of National Institutes of Health were clearing out an old lab that belonged to the Food and Drug Administration. They found vials that were labeled variola virus. That's the official name of smallpox, which is arguably the most deadly disease ever to affect mankind. It covers the body in horrible boils and kills about 30 percent of its victims. The last known case was in 1977. And we thought there were only two labs in the world that still had samples, so this comes as a big shock. BLOCK: So they found these vials. And what happened to them then? BRUMFIEL: Fortunately, the workers recognized immediately what they had. They put the vials back in the boxes and moved it to the NIH's biosafety level three laboratory. Then, they notified officials at the Centers for Disease Control. They called in FBI, and they brought in local law enforcement to guard the samples. Yesterday evening, they were moved to CDC headquarters in Atlanta and put into an even higher security biosafety level four lab. That's the kind of lab where people are wearing moon suits. You see them on the movies. Preliminary DNA tests showed that the six vials contained smallpox virus, though the CDC can't yet confirm if it was still infectious. BLOCK: And have they been able to trace back where these vials of smallpox virus came from in the first place? BRUMFIEL: The files appear to date from the 1950s. And I spoke to the CDC, and they weren't willing to speculate much beyond that. I also talked to D. A. Henderson, the researcher who led the effort to eradicate smallpox. And he says, they're probably just samples somebody lost track of. D,A, HENDERSON: Virologists and microbiologists often put away certain specimens and kind of forget that they have them. BLOCK: Geoff, that's not very reassuring. I mean, this isn't just any sample. This is smallpox virus, a deadly, deadly disease. BRUMFIEL: Well, Henderson told me, you have to remember this is back in the 1950s. And smallpox is still a disease out in the world. So back then, you know, the researchers would have been vaccinated against smallpox and so would have much of the U. S. population. And actually, they were just handling it out in the open. It wasn't particularly dangerous to them. Henderson says, he can remember a government laboratory roughly in that area called the Division of Biologic Standards. And that may have been the government entity that had this virus, though obviously that's just speculation. There will be a much more thorough investigation. BLOCK: What happens to these vials of smallpox virus now? BRUMFIEL: Well, the CDC is going to conduct some further tests on them. They're going to do a more detailed DNA sequence. They want to find out if this really could have still been infectious, and they believe that it probably could have. It appears to be stored in a form that is viable for long periods of time. It also may provide some clues as to where the virus came from, although at that time, people were swapping viruses a lot between labs. So it's hard to say for sure whether they'll be up to pinpoint it's origin. Ultimately, though, this virus will be destroyed. BLOCK: And how do you go about destroying a smallpox virus? BRUMFIEL: Well, one way to do it is to autoclave it - to basically burn it in very high heat. And that should destroy the virus for good. BLOCK: That's NPR's Geoff Brumfiel. Geoff, thanks.

So if you read poetry to your tomatoes, can they hear you? That's a good question. What about the chewing of a hungry caterpillar? (SOUNDBITE OF CATERPILLAR VIBRATION)SIEGEL: Well, that one we do know the answer to, and the answer is, yes. This recording, and the research showing that plants respond to it, come from the University of Missouri. It's the first study to suggest that plants can recognize the sound of a predator through vibrations on their leaves. To explain how that conclusion was reached, we're joined by Heidi Appel. She and Rex Cocroft did this research. She's a senior research scientist in the College of Agriculture, Food and Natural Resources, at the University Missouri. Welcome to the program. HEIDI APPEL: Thank you, pleasure to be here. SIEGEL: And how did you conduct a study with the leaves and the caterpillars? APPEL: Well, the first thing we had to do was record the kinds of vibrations that caterpillars make on leaves when they're feeding. And these vibrations are very subtle - you can't actually see them. The leaves are moving like one ten-thousandth of an inch. But you can record those very delicate movements with a cold laser. So we were able to play back those vibrations to the plants in the absence of the caterpillars and then afterwards, challenge the plants with insects and measure their chemical response. SIEGEL: And the chemical response was different if - if they'd been exposed to these vibrations beforehand? APPEL: Yes, they made many more mustard oils, which are these insect repellents. And we also in a second experiment measured anthocyanins, which are things that give flowers their color, red wine its lovely hue, and provide the health benefits to chocolate. And those defenses too were increased in plants after attack, if the plant had received the vibrations beforehand. SIEGEL: So what you're saying is that a plant that has experienced, what sounded like the harassment of a caterpillar, responds differently than an inexperienced plant. APPEL: That's correct. And in our second experiment, we really wanted to tackle the question, is this ability to detect the vibrations ever important - because a plant of course is exposed to all kinds of help vibrations outdoors. So, in this second experiment we played back vibrations caused by a gentle wind on the leaves and also vibrations from a common insect in the plant's habitat, a tree-hopper. And neither of those vibrations stimulated the chemical defense. SIEGEL: What plant was it that you used? APPEL: We started with arabidopsis thaliana, which is the lab rat of the plant world. It's very useful to us because it has a completely sequenced genome and a lot of other genetic resources. SIEGEL: And what we call it in English? APPEL: Thale cress. SIEGEL: It's a kind of cress. >>APPEL Yeah, mustard. It's related to the water cress - you know, we love to eat. And that - those mustard oils are what make the water cress tasty to us. SIEGEL: Heidi Appel, thank you very much for talking with us. APPEL: Thank you, Robert. It's been my pleasure.

Along the way, it's dammed and diverted dozens of times to cities and fields all over the American West. But drought and the tens of millions of people who depend on that river are sucking it dry. This week the reservoir that supplies Las Vegas, Lake Mead, reached its lowest level in history. By the time the Colorado River reaches the U. S. -Mexico border, only 10 percent of it is left. At that point, it's a place called the Morelos Dam and is diverted a final time into Mexican farmland. In other words, Morelos is where you go to see the Colorado River die. Rowan Jacobsen is a writer and he recently was at the Morelos Dam, when something pretty astounding happened. He says on one side of the dam, it's this lush, green place and on the other. . . ROWAN JACOBSEN: It's a surreal landscape. You look south and you just see a trench. Big stretches of it are bone-dry. It is just a river of sand at this point. So you just see the riverbed filled with white sand, like you'd find at the beach. And that's all that's left of what used to be a vast delta with about 2 million acres. MCEVERS: Wow. So then recently Mexican and American officials agreed and decided to lift the Morelos Dam and let some water flow into that parched riverbed. Why? JACOBSEN: It was 15 years in the works and it's a complicated arrangement. There's a lot of pieces to it. But one part that everyone came to agree on is that it would be a great thing to let a bunch of water go down the traditional channel, purely for ecological restoration, which was the first time the U. S. and Mexican governments have done anything like that. MCEVERS: And so you were there when they lifted the dam. Tell us where exactly you were when that happened. JACOBSEN: I was directly below the dam which, in retrospect, was probably a fairly stupid place to be. MCEVERS: (Laughing) Yeah. JACOBSEN: But I wasn't alone. There was maybe a couple hundred of us there. So the gate opened and this little surge came out. And we all cheered and we popped some champagne. And then we realized the surge was a bit bigger than we had expected. So pretty quick we had to scramble up a bank to get away from it. But that was a good sign because this was going to be a full-blown river, at least for a few weeks. MCEVERS: So they really - they lift the dam, slowly. It starts to look like, wow, this is going to be a river. What was your plan? JACOBSEN: We pulled together a small band of river rafts and paddle boards. MCEVERS: This is basically like standing on a surfboard and paddling your way through. JACOBSEN: Yeah, all day long. The first 22 miles, it actually forms the border with Arizona. So we would be paddling and we could see the Border Patrol guys off to the side, occasionally, when the river would curve through there. They were a little freaked out by the whole situation. MCEVERS: So as you follow the path of the water down, how were people reacting to the fact that this river was coming back after being gone for decades? JACOBSEN: Yeah, you know, the end of our first day, we came into this town called San Luis Rio, Colorado, which was always a river town, until the water dried up. So us and the water arrived in this town that hadn't seen water in decades. MCEVERS: Wow. JACOBSEN: And the party had started already. All the kids were waiting there and the kids start splashing the water, cranking up the ranchero music. And it was just a huge fiesta. MCEVERS: So water from the Colorado River eventually did reach the sea, all the way to the Gulf of California. What's going to happen now? Is that water going to keep flowing? JACOBSEN: No, it's done. It was shut off in May. Enough water has been purchased to basically keep a trickle going for the next five years to try to keep these trees alive. But it's just a trickle. MCEVERS: I mean, 'cause I think we have to say that we are here in the West in the middle of a major drought. I mean, how can you make the case this particular project needs water over some other, you know, bigger agricultural projects - you know, obviously cities that need water? JACOBSEN: It's super controversial and a lot of people think this was about the dumbest thing you possibly could have done with the water. But, you know, 50 times as much water as was released from this project is used for irrigation to make alfalfa, basically, to feed cattle. So if we can just take 1/50 of the water we used to make hamburgers and milk from the Colorado River, we can have this kind of event every year. MCEVERS: That's Rowan Jacobsen.

Here's NPR's Priska Neely. PRISKA NEELY, BYLINE: I've been interested in Pluto since I was little for a pretty simple reason - like my name, it starts with a P. ALAN STERN: Well, that's one reason. My name starts with an A and I'm interested in Pluto. NEELY: Alan Stern is more than interested. He's the principal investigator for the New Horizons mission to Pluto. Planning for this mission started almost 25 years ago and Stern has been there since the beginning. Next year on July 14th Stern and his team will finally see that close encounter. They chose that date back in 2001. STERN: Not only do we choose the date, by the way, we chose the hour and the minute and we're on track. We're arriving at Pluto on the morning of the 14 of July 2015. It's Bastille Day - to celebrate, we're storming the gates of Pluto. NEELY: But let me be clear, this is an unmanned flyby mission by a spacecraft about the size and shape of a baby grand piano. No humans or robots will be landing and walking around. STERN: Arriving's a little bit of a squishy term, I know. At closest, approach will be about 6,000 miles from Pluto. NEELY: That distance was carefully calculated to make sure that they could get the sharpest images and avoid being pulled into Pluto's orbit. Six thousand miles away is still way closer than we've ever been. STERN: The closest any spacecraft had ever been to Pluto was ridiculously far - about a billion miles. And we've been within a billion miles of Pluto for years now and so everyday we break our own record. NEELY: The best images of Pluto so far are from the Hubble telescope. By May of next year, the New Horizons spacecraft will beat that. STERN: We actually call that our BTH date - Better Than Hubble. NEELY: By the way, in case you're wondering the New Horizons team didn't plan on the whole thing where Pluto was demoted to a dwarf planet - the same year as the launch. But that didn't change anything for Alan Stern. STERN: I always think of Pluto as a planet. NEELY: Some planetary scientists still dispute Pluto's planet status. And either way, Stern says, missions like this always turn up surprises. STERN: When we first sent missions to Jupiter no one expected to find moons that would have active volcanoes. And I think there's been a long list of how many times we've been surprised by the richness of nature. NEELY: And so now we wait. STERN: You'll just have to wait just like we will to unwrap this present. Save the date - July 14th, 2015 - humankind's encounter with Pluto.

And she joins me now from the Netherlands. Welcome to the program, Katherine. KATHERINE CRONIN: Thank you. Thank you for having me. RATH: Can you tell us what your research team observed in Africa? CRONIN: So in 2010 we went to visit a chimpanzee sanctuary in Zambia. And we noticed that this one adult female, Julie, had this peculiar behavior of putting grass in her ear. But it didn't really pique our interest until we came back the next year in 2011, and it had started to spread throughout the group. So we started the daily video collection program with our Zambian colleagues who were there year-round and could see the chimps every day. And it was when we were able to go back through this video and document the spread of the behavior that we got interested. RATH: Why is that? CRONIN: Well, because we know that chimpanzees can copy behaviors from others. But usually what we find is that they're copying behaviors that clearly have some kind of important function. But here, this silly behavior doesn't bring them any of the things that are so important to animals, like more food or potential mates. And so when we see them copying this odd behavior that doesn't seem to have any function, we learn that they have some kind of intrinsic motivation or some kind of desire to perform the behaviors that others in the group are performing. RATH: There was one that seemed to actually not really enjoy sticking the grass in his ear, but he did it anyways. I'm thinking of me being a kid having to wear a tie to go to a nice restaurant. Is that silly? CRONIN: Yeah, yeah. The first time I saw Val was his name. He was an adult male in the group. And he took this piece of grass that was actually quite a bit shorter than the size that Julie usually uses, and he stuck it in his ear, and he was shivering every time he did it. And he would put it back in and he would get the shakes, basically, and pull it out. And then try it again. And so I think that anthropologists and psychologists have known for a long time that humans tend to copy behaviors of others in their social groups, so things like you're saying, what we wear, what we say, what we eat. But here we see that chimps are also copying this sort of arbitrary behavior, which shows us that it's not only our species that tends to behave in ways that lead to some kind of cultural similarity, but actually that this tendency could have some deep biological roots.

There are also chemical changes happening in the ocean. As people put more carbon dioxide up into the atmosphere, the oceans absorb more of it and that makes the water more acidic. The effects can be tough to spot in most places. But scientists say if this continues it could be a disaster for marine life. They also say there may be ways to protect plants and animals in the oceans. NPR's Christopher Joyce reports. CHRISTOPHER JOYCE, BYLINE: There are a few places in the ocean that are naturally very acidic - seeps where carbon dioxide rises out of vents in the seafloor. These could offer a preview of the future. Marine biologist Kristy Kroeker has dived down to see those places. I talked to her about them aboard a research boat in the Pacific. KRISTY KROEKER: It's like you're swimming through a glass of champagne where there are bubbles coming up all around you. JOYCE: But with a shot of vinegar thrown in. And the effects of that acidity are nasty. KROEKER: It's really striking. And it's not, I think, what people want their oceans to look like. The algae tends to overgrow just about everything so you get a more monotone, green, slimy ecosystem. JOYCE: There's almost nothing alive. In the rest of the world's oceans, things aren't that bad yet. But even small increases in acidity are having subtle effects - on shellfish, for example. KROEKER: It takes more energy for these animals to build their shells in more acidic conditions. These are things like oysters or muscles or snails. JOYCE: Marine biologists are becoming somewhat obsessed with acidification and some are looking for ways to protect marine animals and plants. Here in California they found nearly ideal places to do that. The state has created them - the nation's largest network of coastal reserves. You can see why they have. In a beach in downtown Santa Cruz, volleyball players lunge across the sand courts. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Get up, get up, get up. JOYCE: Tourists line up for whale watching and dive trips. And kids marvel as glistening seals surface and beg for food. More than two-thirds of Californians live within a few miles of the ocean, but all that love has also brought pollution, oil spills and overfishing. That's why the state has created 124 protected areas along its coast. Some hug the shore, some are miles out in the ocean. You can't drill or develop in any of them, and you can't fish in about half of them. Ecologist Mark Carr says they were intended to be aquatic wildernesses and fish nurseries. MARK CARR: You're protecting the sources of young that are replenishing those populations along the coast. JOYCE: Carr studies fish at the University of California, Santa Cruz. He says so far the network seems to be helping some species - lobster and blue rockfish, for example. But now Carr and other scientists say these protected areas are like natural laboratories where scientists can study an even bigger problem, one they'd never imagined when they created the reserves - ocean acidification. Here's why - when something affects marine life in the ocean, it's often hard for scientists to pinpoint the cause. CARR: When they see changes in the size of fish populations, to what extent is that driven by fishing or to what extent is that driven by changes in the ocean climate? JOYCE: If there's no fishing and fish numbers are going down then scientists know it must be something else, perhaps acidification affecting the food chain from plankton up to tuna. The value of reserves isn't lost on fishermen either. Some who first fought the idea of reserves, like Bruce Steele, now embrace them. I meet Steele at a beach near Santa Barbara. He spent 40 years scuba-diving for sea urchins in these waters. BRUCE STEELE: You have to have some place to look where you can filter out the fishing influence, otherwise what would happen? It's so much easier to just blame us. You could just say it's just the fisherman, we're not really going to take care of these problems. JOYCE: Scientists from the University of California, Santa Barbara have already selected a protected area for acidification research. The team has gathered in the cabin of a 55-foot research boat in the city's harbor. They're off for a four-day expedition. JAY LUNDEN: Hi, everybody. Welcome aboard. JOYCE: Biologist Jay Lunden outlines the trip. Today it's Santa Cruz Island, an island near the city surrounded by protected areas. Why this island? Because of the seagrasses here, also called eelgrass. They're underwater meadows and they do something very curious that's got these scientists excited. The grasses seem to be able to neutralize acidity in the water. LUNDEN: Seagrass beds absorb CO2, and they can buffer acidification. And that's why we're going to this seagrass bed. We want to know where the seagrasses actually are. JOYCE: If that's true, these places could become refuges for sea life trying to escape acidic water. Ninety minutes by a boat from the coast, the island is a menagerie of sea life. Team leader Gretchen Hofmann says the plants and animals here have evolved to live in this particular environment around this island. That means they're very sensitive to changes in the chemistry of seawater here. If it becomes more acidic they'll show it, like living litmus paper. GRETCHEN HOFMANN: This isn't just some esoteric little exercise because we know that organisms are very fine tune and adapted to what they've experienced historically in the environment. JOYCE: Once the boat is anchored near the island, the team lowers a video camera overboard looking for eelgrass. They watch from a big screen in the cabin. HOFMANN: You want to be right above it. OK, we're now in the eelgrass bed. Oh, oh, right there. Oh, did you see that? A giant kelp fish. JOYCE: Out on deck, Hofmann watches as other members of the team motor back and forth above the seagrass bed in the zodiac dinghy, taking water samples to check for acidity. It's slow going and wet. HOFMANN: Zodiac science is zodiac science. How many more samples do you have left - over? UNIDENTIFIED MAN 2: We've got to do the ten on the outside of the seagrass bed. HOFMANN: Copy that. JOYCE: But things perk up when the local wildlife comes over to investigate. HOFMANN: You've got a sea lion coming in at three o'clock - over. UNIDENTIFIED MAN 2: Copy that. JOYCE: This is what scientists call laying the groundwork. It's slow. It will take years and thousands of measurements like these to see if these underwater meadows really can neutralize acidity in any meaningful way. But Hofmann says there's a lot at stake. HOFMANN: You know, we want to do something to protect our backyard, our part of the ocean. And we're realizing that if these beds of eelgrass are good and that they buffer future changes in acidity, we should be protecting them or maybe even restoring them. JOYCE: Or even planting them, something scientists are experimenting with now. In so doing, they could create refuges for fishes and plants in the sea world that could become increasingly become hostile. Safe places, where as local fishermen sometimes say, the water stays sweet. Christopher Joyce, NPR News. MONTAGNE: And we're glad you're starting your day here with us at NPR News. We've got more ahead this morning on MORNING EDITION and later today tune in for All Things Considered. This is NPR News. RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST:  We often hear about rising sea levels. There are also chemical changes happening in the ocean. As people put more carbon dioxide up into the atmosphere, the oceans absorb more of it and that makes the water more acidic. The effects can be tough to spot in most places. But scientists say if this continues it could be a disaster for marine life. They also say there may be ways to protect plants and animals in the oceans. NPR's Christopher Joyce reports. CHRISTOPHER JOYCE, BYLINE: There are a few places in the ocean that are naturally very acidic - seeps where carbon dioxide rises out of vents in the seafloor. These could offer a preview of the future. Marine biologist Kristy Kroeker has dived down to see those places. I talked to her about them aboard a research boat in the Pacific. KRISTY KROEKER: It's like you're swimming through a glass of champagne where there are bubbles coming up all around you. JOYCE: But with a shot of vinegar thrown in. And the effects of that acidity are nasty. KROEKER: It's really striking. And it's not, I think, what people want their oceans to look like. The algae tends to overgrow just about everything so you get a more monotone, green, slimy ecosystem. JOYCE: There's almost nothing alive. In the rest of the world's oceans, things aren't that bad yet. But even small increases in acidity are having subtle effects - on shellfish, for example. KROEKER: It takes more energy for these animals to build their shells in more acidic conditions. These are things like oysters or muscles or snails. JOYCE: Marine biologists are becoming somewhat obsessed with acidification and some are looking for ways to protect marine animals and plants. Here in California they found nearly ideal places to do that. The state has created them - the nation's largest network of coastal reserves. You can see why they have. In a beach in downtown Santa Cruz, volleyball players lunge across the sand courts. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Get up, get up, get up. JOYCE: Tourists line up for whale watching and dive trips. And kids marvel as glistening seals surface and beg for food. More than two-thirds of Californians live within a few miles of the ocean, but all that love has also brought pollution, oil spills and overfishing. That's why the state has created 124 protected areas along its coast. Some hug the shore, some are miles out in the ocean. You can't drill or develop in any of them, and you can't fish in about half of them. Ecologist Mark Carr says they were intended to be aquatic wildernesses and fish nurseries. MARK CARR: You're protecting the sources of young that are replenishing those populations along the coast. JOYCE: Carr studies fish at the University of California, Santa Cruz. He says so far the network seems to be helping some species - lobster and blue rockfish, for example. But now Carr and other scientists say these protected areas are like natural laboratories where scientists can study an even bigger problem, one they'd never imagined when they created the reserves - ocean acidification. Here's why - when something affects marine life in the ocean, it's often hard for scientists to pinpoint the cause. CARR: When they see changes in the size of fish populations, to what extent is that driven by fishing or to what extent is that driven by changes in the ocean climate? JOYCE: If there's no fishing and fish numbers are going down then scientists know it must be something else, perhaps acidification affecting the food chain from plankton up to tuna. The value of reserves isn't lost on fishermen either. Some who first fought the idea of reserves, like Bruce Steele, now embrace them. I meet Steele at a beach near Santa Barbara. He spent 40 years scuba-diving for sea urchins in these waters. BRUCE STEELE: You have to have some place to look where you can filter out the fishing influence, otherwise what would happen? It's so much easier to just blame us. You could just say it's just the fisherman, we're not really going to take care of these problems. JOYCE: Scientists from the University of California, Santa Barbara have already selected a protected area for acidification research. The team has gathered in the cabin of a 55-foot research boat in the city's harbor. They're off for a four-day expedition. JAY LUNDEN: Hi, everybody. Welcome aboard. JOYCE: Biologist Jay Lunden outlines the trip. Today it's Santa Cruz Island, an island near the city surrounded by protected areas. Why this island? Because of the seagrasses here, also called eelgrass. They're underwater meadows and they do something very curious that's got these scientists excited. The grasses seem to be able to neutralize acidity in the water. LUNDEN: Seagrass beds absorb CO2, and they can buffer acidification. And that's why we're going to this seagrass bed. We want to know where the seagrasses actually are. JOYCE: If that's true, these places could become refuges for sea life trying to escape acidic water. Ninety minutes by a boat from the coast, the island is a menagerie of sea life. Team leader Gretchen Hofmann says the plants and animals here have evolved to live in this particular environment around this island. That means they're very sensitive to changes in the chemistry of seawater here. If it becomes more acidic they'll show it, like living litmus paper.

(SOUNDBITE OF BABY TALKING)SIEGEL: In babies. Most babies don't utter actual words until after their first birthday. But according to a new study that's out this week as early as 7-months-of-age babies brains are already working on the mechanics of how to form words. They are rehearsing how to speak months before their first words. Patricia Kuhl is the lead author of the study. She's co-director of the University of Washington's Institute for Learning and Brain Sciences and she joins us now. Welcome to the program. PATRICIA KUHL: Hi Robert. Thanks for inviting me. SIEGEL: Let's first have you explain how you carried out this study about what's going on inside the brains of 7-month-olds. KUHL: Well, first of all we had to have one of these wonderful new machines magnetoencephalography - MEG for short - what it allows is for the first time we can see inside the baby brain as the baby's doing something interesting - like listening to language. SIEGEL: And you played them sounds over headphones. What did you see going on when you did that? KUHL: As the brain listens to sound the baby's auditory areas aren't the only areas lighting up. It's also the areas that they use to talk - their motor-planning areas. It's as though the baby's rehearsing their next moves. They're trying to join the community of people who use their mouths in these funny ways to create sounds. And so here we see the babies at 7-months where on the outside you don't see anything - they're wide-eyed and they're looking at you and they love to listen to you. But what's going on in their little brains is the attempt to do it to, they want to be one of us. And that means they have to rehearse the mechanics of this pretty difficult signal to produce. SIEGEL: You also write that exaggerated speech is helpful. Why? KUHL: Well, we've been studying for some time this phenomenon that we call mother-ese or now parent-ese because both parents and everyone seems to do it. If I had a 2-month-er in my hand I'd be saying something like, hi cutie let's open those big blue eyes, you know, using these stretched out vowels and big excursions and pitch contour - and speaking quite slowly. Babies not only love to listen to that - their language development is zooming forward at a much more rapid rate. Languages at 2-years-of-age if you're exposure at 11 and 14-months is quite high, you have twice the number of words that you know when compared to children who are not hearing much mother-ese and not hearing that in face-to-face communication. SIEGEL: I was just wondering - perhaps we could bring back little Zosha (ph) whom heard a few seconds of a moment ago. And you could tell us what would you say to this? (SOUNDBITE OF BABY TALKING)KUHL: First of all, I'd smile and say, you're adorable. I mean, that is such a wonderful sound. You can help but smile when you hear that. And you can see that that's, you know, those aren't clear words coming out - but that's just pure joy and the attempts to do what you're doing - which is to talk. And I think that drive that deep, deep social drive to communicate, to talk back, to volley when you serve, to go back and forth is really strong. And you can see it in their eyes but to see it in their brains - it was astounding to see that practice as the brains getting ready to make its next move. SIEGEL: Well, I think you've helped make several people's ride home a little bit more fun this evening. Thanks for talking with us. KUHL: Well, I hope so and thanks for having me Robert.

I'm Audie Cornish. ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST: I'm Robert Siegel. And now it's time for more Unfolding Science. (SOUNDBITE OF TOOLS WHIRRING AND BOX OPENING)SIEGEL: Yes, that sound means we're going to hear a story from NPR science correspondent Joe Palca about how things fold and unfold in science. Today, Joe tells us about an ancient folding technique. It's being applied to the most modern of scientific endeavors, exploring space. JOE PALCA, BYLINE: Let's say you're a spacecraft designer, and you want to carry a giant solar panel into space. In order to fit it into your rocket, you need to fold it up. Now, you could fold it in half and then in half again and then in half again. But once in space, you'd have to reverse the process, unfolding one fold, then another, then another. Or you could use the ancient art of origami to help you out. BRIAN TREASE: I have a demo right here, actually. PALCA: Brian Trease is an engineer at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. The demo is just a sheet of typing paper, folded over and over so it's about the size of a large matchbook. Trease made it using a newly created origami fold named for its inventor, Japanese astrophysicist Koryo Miura. And it's the way the sheet unfolds that's remarkable. Trease grasps the top and bottom of the matchbook and pulls. And in one motion it opens to a flat sheet again - simple. And simplicity is key when you're designing spacecraft. TREASE: If I was deploying this in space, I would only need one motor to do that deployment. PALCA: It's cool because it looks like - it looks like - when you see it sitting there, it looks like you'd have to unfold it in several steps. And the idea that you can just pull it apart and have it fully open is pretty amazing. TREASE: So that's the beauty of the design. PALCA: And this isn't the only way origami might help spacecraft designers. For example, Trease says there are now printers that can print things like electronic circuits and computer memory directly onto a sheet of paper. TREASE: They say, wow, I can print all that on a sheet of paper. That's almost all the systems you need for a spacecraft. So there's folks here interested in what we call printable spacecraft. PALCA: Printable spacecraft. TREASE: Printable spacecraft. PALCA: You'd print the electronic stuff on a flat sheet, and use origami folding to turn it into some useful shape - probably not a swan, but maybe a soccer ball that could roll around on another planet. And to land these printable spacecrafts, all you need to do is shove them out the door of a probe orbiting overhead. TREASE: We call these flutter landers. And they just fall to the surface. And then, once they're down, then they could assemble into their shapes or do their science - something like that. PALCA: That sounds so wild. But that's what happens when you start unfolding science. Joe Palca, NPR News. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:  From NPR News, it's ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Audie Cornish.

LAUREN ARRINGTON: I mean scientists were doing plenty of tests on them. But they just always assumed they were in the ocean. So I was like, well, hey guys, what about the river? MCEVERS: Lauren Arrington's sixth-grade project showed that lionfish can survive in fresh water, too. Her dad's a fish ecologist, so Lauren knew some stuff about fish. LAUREN ARRINGTON: Sometimes, we would even catch them when me and my dad were fishing. So we dissected plenty of them when we caught them. MCEVERS: Lauren is really into lionfish. So as soon as she heard about the science fair, she knew what she wanted to do. L. ARRINGTON: I wanted to see how far up the river lionfish could survive. So first off, I thought of putting lionfish in different cages at different river miles. You know, if the further up the river - if they could still live. But it was just a small sixth-grade project and I really didn't have all the tools necessary for that. So then, my dad was like, well, you could put them in tanks. So I was like, oh, OK. So then, I decided to put them in tanks in the river center. And then, there I could just watch them and make sure none of them died, 'cause when - we heard that the science fair would disqualify you if any of your project died. MCEVERS: So you're working on a - under a pretty strict set of rules there. The subject of your experiment cannot die. L. ARRINGTON: Yeah. MCEVERS: OK. So you put some fish in different tanks and then what did you do? L. ARRINGTON: So six lionfish, six different tanks, every night for eight days on the five experimental fish, I would lower the salinity five parts per thousand. So parts per thousand is how you measure salt in the water. Zero parts per thousand is freshwater and then 35 parts per thousand is ocean salinity. So we found the lionfish that we captured in about 25 parts per thousand. So when all of the experimental fish were still alive at six parts per thousand, I was like - pretty amazing. MCEVERS: And then - I mean, it didn't stop there, right? I mean, there was some research published - a research paper published by North Carolina State and they mentioned you. L. ARRINGTON: Yeah, yeah, 'cause he confirmed my results. And so, you know, he credited a sixth-grader for coming up with his idea. MCEVERS: That's Dr. Craig Layman of North Carolina State. So it was because of you that he went on and did further research on this. How did that feel? L. ARRINGTON: I was like, oh. And then friends at school were like, hey, congrats on being published in the science journal, you know. And I was like, yeah, yeah, that's me right there. MCEVERS: (Laughing) Lauren, could you put your dad on line for a second? L. ARRINGTON: Yes ma'am - Dad? ALBREY ARRINGTON: Hello, this is Albrey. MCEVERS: Yeah, hi. So I guess you talk science with your daughter a lot. A. ARRINGTON: Yeah, that's kind of how we are. We're a science bunch of dorks in our family. MCEVERS: (Laughing) I have to ask. I mean, it sounds like Lauren has some pretty good ideas about this experiment. How much of this was you and how much of this was her? A. ARRINGTON: I'm the dad, so participating, but I'm very proud to say this is her - her ideas. It certainly was her work - sitting, measuring salinity, you know. MCEVERS: Well, you must be very, very proud. A. ARRINGTON: Very much so, very pleased. MCEVERS: That is Albrey Arrington and his daughter Lauren joining us from Jupiter, Florida. Thanks so much you guys. A. ARRINGTON: Thank you very much. KELLY MCEVERS, HOST:  Is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR West. I'm Kelly McEvers.

And certainly, even though I might not be alive when we landed on Mars, I'd be watching crews train and the rockets being built. And of course, you can see none of that is happening. ARUN RATH, HOST:  No. We're not living in the future envisioned by astronaut Alan Bean back in 1969. In November of that year, he became the fourth human being to walk on the moon. Today, to mark the 45th anniversary of the first moon landing, Alan Bean recalled how his mission Apollo 12 almost ended in disaster moments after launch. Captain Alan Bean is our Sunday conversation. BEAN: Well, we had a storm rolling in. We were sitting in a - you know, inside our spacecraft - Pete Conrad, Dick Gordon and I. We were thinking, let's launch. We knew that if we didn't launch within just about three or four hours, you had to wait a whole month. So we wanted to go. And we didn't think much about launching during a storm (laughing) 'cause we hadn't ever trained for that and thought about that much. People just assumed we wouldn't. And so we counted down. We launched. Everything was going great for almost the first minute. And then we were struck by lightning two times. We didn't know we were struck by lightning in the cockpit. We got all sorts of warning lights, lost the electrical power from our fuel cells. We were trying to solve the problem. Mission control - they got a report from the launch site that they saw a big lightning bolt come out of a cloud and hit the launch pad. And they said, those guys got struck by lightning. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN 1: (Unintelligible). UNIDENTIFIED MAN 2: Roger. We copy. Pete, you're looking good. UNIDENTIFIED MAN 3: Good (unintelligible). Good thrust on the second (unintelligible). UNIDENTIFIED MAN 4: We've got a problem here. I don't know what happened. I'm not sure we can get hit by lightning. BEAN: You know, we were trying to figure out what to do. They were trying to figure out what to do. And working together, we solved the problem. UNIDENTIFIED MAN 5: OK, I have (unintelligible). And Alan's got the fuel cells back on. And we'll be working on the (unintelligible). RATH: Can you describe what you felt, heard and saw when you left Earth's orbit? BEAN: Well, once again, we're wanting to go to the moon. We've done one revolution around the earth where we got our computer ready to guide the rocket towards the moon. And we were ready to go. And we were just thinking, OK, we know that we've been hit by lightning. Mission control is going to have to make a decision on whether to launch us to the moon or not. They apparently talked it over at the highest levels and decided, well, if it did do something wrong to the spacecraft, like the parachute system or something like that - if we had them enter now, they'd get killed earlier than if we sent them to the moon and let them do whatever else they're doing there and then come back 10 days later. If their parachutes don't work then, well, I guess they don't. At least they've had 10 days and a great adventure. RATH: What did that mean - just skipping ahead for a moment - when you were going through reentry, were you scared about those parachutes opening? BEAN: We thought about it. I would have to say, I didn't think about it one time between headed to the moon and about an hour prior to entry. And we're going through all the checklists, getting in position to make the entry and all of that other - and I think either Pete, Dick or I said, well, I wonder how those parachutes are doing. And then someone else said - maybe me or Peter or Dick said, well, we'll find out in about 55 minutes. And that was it. Nobody was afraid. Nobody was anything. It was just part of the way of life of being an astronaut. If you couldn't have that attitude, you couldn't do the job. So it was - it was OK. Whatever it was, it was OK. RATH: Now, can you recapture that moment for us, Captain Bean, when you climbed through the door, down the ladder, onto the moon? BEAN: I would say, I had zero philosophical thoughts at that time. I was operating on a time checklist, as we'd been trained to do, to try to maximize every, really, minute on the moon. You know, no telling what that cost per minute to be on the moon. Millions and millions of dollars. So you wanted to make every one of them productive. The only time I thought, wow, this is the moon up there, way above us there - 240,000 miles away is the Earth - was when I was running from exploration site to the next one 'cause there, you're just running along going to the next place you want to investigate. And you can have a time to think. And I can remember I - it was hard for me to believe. I would look down and say, this is the moon. This is the moon. Then I would look up and say, that's the earth, that's the earth, in my head. So it was science fiction to us, even as we were doing it. RATH: You've had a post-astronaut career as an artist. Could you talk about how you use moon dust in your paintings? BEAN: I had the good fortune and the gift to be one of the 12 men to walk on the moon. And my hobby has been, since I was a test pilot, painting. Maybe if I learn to paint well enough - I don't know if I could, but maybe if I did - then I could leave behind when I am gone stories that would be lost to history forever - images of things that we did that were - at least I thought were interesting. Stories that not only I knew, but other astronauts knew. So that was my decision to you know say, I love being an astronaut. I've been training to do this my whole life. But I really have a responsibility to go to do this other job, which I then had been doing for the last 33 years or so. But each painting does have moon dust in it. RATH: Astronaut, artist and moonwalker Captain Alan Bean. It's been an honor to speak with you. Thank you so much. BEAN: It's been a pleasure. RATH: And if you want to hear about that peculiar way Captain Bean works the moon dust into his paintings, take a listen at NPR. org.

What does it mean to us when we're told in operation has a 70 percent chance of success or that there's a 60 percent likelihood that Osama bin Laden is hiding in a particular compound in Pakistan? Well, here's one of the most common encounters with percent probabilities. What does it mean that there's a 20 percent chance of rain? We put that question to a few folks on the streets of Phoenix and Milwaukee. Milwaukeeans Linda Gee and Paul Hess drew different inferences. PAUL HESS: Well, 20 percent chance of rain - I think that's a reasonably high percentage - that you should prepare. You take a jacket or an umbrella or whatever. LINDA GEE: If it's higher, I would think that it would rain. Twenty percent is not that much. SIEGEL: In Phoenix, Erik Noland would batten down the hatches. ERIK NOLAND: It means that it probably is going to rain. SIEGEL: Chad Cashin and Angel Denison split the difference. . . CHAD CASHIN: I think that means it's going to drizzle a bit in the area somewhere. ANGEL DENISON: It may sprinkle here and there, and it might get a little humid. Might have some clouds. You may or may not. SIEGEL: . . . While Ahmed Khan, presented with a 20 percent chance of rain, did the subtraction. AHMED KHAN: That means 80 percent is no chance. SIEGEL: We put the same question - what does it mean to say there's a 20 percent chance of rain? - to a math professor. HESS: Well, if I had any answer, I would be a famous philosopher instead of a mathematician. I mean, it's a very difficult question. And people have been arguing about it for a really long time. SIEGEL: Jordan Ellenberg teaches mathematics at the University of Wisconsin. He wrote the book, \"How Not To Be Wrong. \" But on this question, it's evidently hard to be right. HESS: There's a few things it could mean. And I think customarily in weather prediction, one thing it means is that if you look at a big population of days where the conditions were similar to what they are right now - not exactly the same because no two days are the same, right? I mean, every day is a new thing. But let's say you sort of find a thousand days where the conditions that you can measure are close enough to the conditions obtained right now. And you find that out of those 2,000, on 200 of them, the next day was a rainy day. Well, that might be one thing you mean when you say there's a 20 percent chance of rain. SIEGEL: It's a less philosophical question at the National Weather Service. Vankita Brown works there. She is not a forecaster. She's a social scientist whose job is to try to better understand what the public understands about the weather forecast. I put it to her. A 20 percent chance of rain - does she have a good understanding of what that means? GEE: Absolutely not. (Laughing). SIEGEL: You don't have a good idea of what it means. GEE: No, and I work at the Weather Service. But I am not a meteorologist, and I am not trained in providing forecasts, so. . . SIEGEL: But we hear something like that every day. GEE: We do. We think people know what it means. I have conversations with my colleagues in meteorology all the time about what that means. In fact, I challenged one today to tell me in less than five minutes what does it mean. SIEGEL: You were preparing for this conversation. GEE: I was preparing for this conversation. SIEGEL: And did the meteorologist have a very clear, concise. . . GEE: No. SIEGEL: No. GEE: (Laughing). SIEGEL: Of course, for the National Weather Service, this is not something to puzzle over for fun. It's serious stuff. They need the public to not just understand weather forecasts, but to have confidence in them, so that people will respond appropriately to weather threats. And they don't just use numbers. They also use words - words like watch and warning. GEE: Watch means that conditions are ripe for something to happen. Warning means that it is happening. It is eminent. SIEGEL: But Vankita Brown says, people get those two confused all the time. GEE: It's easy to get them confused. They both start with W. They both start with W-A. So it's understandable that people are getting them confused. SIEGEL: Is the Weather Service thinking of more words - preferably ones that don't begin with W-A, too - that would flesh out a - kind of a scale of thunderstorm or tornado information? GEE: We are. Yes. Well, we're asking people what words would work for them. Instead of watch, instead of warning, they've offered things like emergency. SIEGEL: Emergency. GEE: Imminent, dangerous, caution - things like that. SIEGEL: Perhaps take action. When it comes to less dramatic forecasts, Brown is also trying to figure out what works best. Should the Weather Service use descriptive words, as in rain is likely, or percent probabilities, as in 70 percent chance of rain, or icons - say, a picture of a cloud with a few raindrops? GEE: Honestly, I think all three. We've been doing some research lately. We've hosted focus groups. And we find that, alone, they don't work so well, but in tandem, they all work well to tell a story. SIEGEL: Kind of a mixed media presentation of the likelihood of, in this case, rain. GEE: Absolutely. SIEGEL: Weather forecasting technology has gotten a lot better in recent years. It used to be that the fourth day of a four-day forecast was about as good as a fortune cookie or a horoscope when it came to accuracy. Now we can look almost a week ahead with some confidence. How much confidence? Well, Jason Samenow, the chief meteorologist with the Washington Post's Capital Weather Gang, says, that varies. So he attaches a confidence level to his forecasts. Samenow may say, there's a 20 to 30 percent chance of evening showers and storms - confidence medium to high. NOLAND: The forecast models - they give these probabilities. But obviously, the farther you go out in time, the less skill or accuracy these models have. And so our confidence in those probabilities tends to, over time, especially as you get out to three, four, five days in the future - tends to decrease. And sometimes with particularly complex weather set ups, our confidence in those probabilities are even lower. So, you know, for complicated snowstorms, we might have just a low to medium confidence of what the models are simulating within 12 to 24 hours.  But typically what happens is we have fairly high confidence out to 36 to 48 hours, and then, gradually, our forecast confidence declines. And basically, once we get to seven to ten days, we have very little to no confidence. SIEGEL: Jason Samenow says, his readers in Washington Post respond well to that statistical humility. NOLAND: We've got a lot of feedback from readers that they appreciate having that information. And especially, it's true during snowstorms. And we've developed what we call boom and bust probabilities to give people a sense of what we think the chances a snowstorm is going to overachieve or underachieve our best guess forecast. I think the more information you can give people when the weather is complicated or when the weather is highly impactful has the potential to make a difference in someone's life and their decision-making the better. More information is power, in that sense. SIEGEL: Most weather forecasts are not about blizzards, hurricanes and tornadoes. Lives are typically not riding on a 20 percent chance of rain. Tomorrow, the stakes are higher. How would you deal with a number that tells you the probability that a particular terrorist is in a particular place? ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:  This week, we're considering how we interpret probability in everyday and not-so-everyday life.

And you find that out of those 2,000, on 200 of them, the next day was a rainy day. Well, that might be one thing you mean when you say there's a 20 percent chance of rain. SIEGEL: It's a less philosophical question at the National Weather Service. Vankita Brown works there. She is not a forecaster. She's a social scientist whose job is to try to better understand what the public understands about the weather forecast. I put it to her. A 20 percent chance of rain - does she have a good understanding of what that means? GEE: Absolutely not. (Laughing). SIEGEL: You don't have a good idea of what it means. GEE: No, and I work at the Weather Service. But I am not a meteorologist, and I am not trained in providing forecasts, so. . . SIEGEL: But we hear something like that every day. GEE: We do. We think people know what it means. I have conversations with my colleagues in meteorology all the time about what that means. In fact, I challenged one today to tell me in less than five minutes what does it mean. SIEGEL: You were preparing for this conversation. GEE: I was preparing for this conversation. SIEGEL: And did the meteorologist have a very clear, concise. . . GEE: No. SIEGEL: No. GEE: (Laughing). SIEGEL: Of course, for the National Weather Service, this is not something to puzzle over for fun. It's serious stuff. They need the public to not just understand weather forecasts, but to have confidence in them, so that people will respond appropriately to weather threats. And they don't just use numbers. They also use words - words like watch and warning. GEE: Watch means that conditions are ripe for something to happen. Warning means that it is happening. It is eminent. SIEGEL: But Vankita Brown says, people get those two confused all the time. GEE: It's easy to get them confused. They both start with W. They both start with W-A. So it's understandable that people are getting them confused. SIEGEL: Is the Weather Service thinking of more words - preferably ones that don't begin with W-A, too - that would flesh out a - kind of a scale of thunderstorm or tornado information? GEE: We are. Yes. Well, we're asking people what words would work for them. Instead of watch, instead of warning, they've offered things like emergency. SIEGEL: Emergency. GEE: Imminent, dangerous, caution - things like that. SIEGEL: Perhaps take action. When it comes to less dramatic forecasts, Brown is also trying to figure out what works best. Should the Weather Service use descriptive words, as in rain is likely, or percent probabilities, as in 70 percent chance of rain, or icons - say, a picture of a cloud with a few raindrops? GEE: Honestly, I think all three. We've been doing some research lately. We've hosted focus groups. And we find that, alone, they don't work so well, but in tandem, they all work well to tell a story. SIEGEL: Kind of a mixed media presentation of the likelihood of, in this case, rain. GEE: Absolutely. SIEGEL: Weather forecasting technology has gotten a lot better in recent years. It used to be that the fourth day of a four-day forecast was about as good as a fortune cookie or a horoscope when it came to accuracy. Now we can look almost a week ahead with some confidence. How much confidence? Well, Jason Samenow, the chief meteorologist with the Washington Post's Capital Weather Gang, says, that varies. So he attaches a confidence level to his forecasts. Samenow may say, there's a 20 to 30 percent chance of evening showers and storms - confidence medium to high. NOLAND: The forecast models - they give these probabilities. But obviously, the farther you go out in time, the less skill or accuracy these models have. And so our confidence in those probabilities tends to, over time, especially as you get out to three, four, five days in the future - tends to decrease. And sometimes with particularly complex weather set ups, our confidence in those probabilities are even lower. So, you know, for complicated snowstorms, we might have just a low to medium confidence of what the models are simulating within 12 to 24 hours.  But typically what happens is we have fairly high confidence out to 36 to 48 hours, and then, gradually, our forecast confidence declines. And basically, once we get to seven to ten days, we have very little to no confidence. SIEGEL: Jason Samenow says, his readers in Washington Post respond well to that statistical humility. NOLAND: We've got a lot of feedback from readers that they appreciate having that information. And especially, it's true during snowstorms. And we've developed what we call boom and bust probabilities to give people a sense of what we think the chances a snowstorm is going to overachieve or underachieve our best guess forecast. I think the more information you can give people when the weather is complicated or when the weather is highly impactful has the potential to make a difference in someone's life and their decision-making the better. More information is power, in that sense. SIEGEL: Most weather forecasts are not about blizzards, hurricanes and tornadoes. Lives are typically not riding on a 20 percent chance of rain. Tomorrow, the stakes are higher. How would you deal with a number that tells you the probability that a particular terrorist is in a particular place?", "section": "Risk And Reason", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2014 NPR.

Two large radio telescopes have detected very brief, very powerful bursts of radio waves. They can't tell where the bursts are coming from or what's causing them. And as NPR's Joe Palca reports, astronomers do not rule out any explanations, even the kind of outrageous claims you'd expect to see in a science fiction novel. JOE PALCA, BYLINE: The first report of these so-called fast radio bursts appeared in 2007. Duncan Lorimer and his colleagues had found the signal buried in recordings made at the Parkes radio telescope in Australia. Lorimer argued at the time that the source of the burst was from way, way beyond our galaxy. But then the same telescope recorded a bunch more bursts that were similar but clearly coming from something much closer by. DUNCAN LORIMER: They cast a lot of doubts on the original detection that we may. PALCA: Something nearby would probably have a much more pedestrian explanation. Other astronomers began to suspect Lorimer's extra-galactic detection was a fluke. But that changed last year. LORIMER: 2013, there came a big paper in Science announcing the discovery of four more. PALCA: That 2013 Science paper convinced most astronomers that something real, far away and still very mysterious was happening. But there was one lingering doubt. All of the detections were made by one radio telescope - the Parkes telescope in Australia. So some astronomers wondered if the burst might not be an astronomical event at all but some problem with the electronics in the telescope. LORIMER: It's clearly not. PALCA: That's because now there's a report of a burst detected at the Arecibo radio telescope in Puerto Rico. Lorimer says that several more reports of detections will soon be showing up in the scientific literature. As you would imagine, there's been lots of speculation about what's behind these mysterious bursts. Some astronomers think they're caused by blitzars. These aren't Santa's reindeer but a pulse of energy from a supermassive star collapsing into a black hole. Others think they may be caused by powerful solar flares coming from stars nearby. LORIMER: There've even been discussions in the literature about signatures from extraterrestrial civilizations. PALCA: What? LORIMER: I had to mention it, didn't I? PALCA: It's just a theoretical paper, suggesting the bursts could be generated by intelligent beings intentionally beaming a radio signal directly at Earth. JAMES CORDES: I would bet against it. PALCA: That's James Cordes. He's an astronomer at Cornell University who's also in the hunt for an explanation of these radio bursts. Cordes says astronomers will need to find more examples of these bursts before they'll be able to say with any certainty what's causing them. But finding them will take time. The kinds of radio telescopes that can detect these bursts have what Cordes calls tunnel vision. CORDES: We don't see the whole sky. We see just a very narrow snippet of it. PALCA: So catching a burst in the act requires a bit of luck. Of course that's frustrating for astronomers. But having only a tiny bit of hard data does have its upside. It means theoreticians can spin out all kinds of interesting ideas. CORDES: The nice thing about this in the current stage is that we really don't know what these bursts are caused by. And so the sky is the limit in some respects. PALCA: I'm tempted to make a comment about an astronomer using the phrase the sky is the limit. But I think I'll let that pass. Joe Palca, NPR News.

S. Air Force missile base. This is one place where officers keep watch over the country's nuclear missiles. Earlier this year, an Air Force investigation found that officers at another base cheated on tests. Dozens were punished, and the Air Force changed the way it manages its officer corps. NPR's Geoff Brumfiel traveled to the Air Force - the Air Force's 90th Missile Wing to find out whether those new rules will stop the cheating. GEOFF BRUMFIEL, BYLINE: It's just before eight in the morning at F. E. Warren Air Force Base, outside Cheyenne, Wyoming. And young officers are arriving at a windowless classroom. CAPTAIN CARLOS BERSIBAY: All righty. Good morning, ladies and judgment, and welcome to Recurring Codes. And Captain Carlos Berisbay, your coder for today. Before we begin begin, does everyone have a. . . BRUMFIEL: These junior officers carry huge responsibility. They keep 150 nuclear-tipped missiles ready to launch at a moment's notice. And understandably, they are expected to know exactly what they're doing. Today's class is on the codes used to launch the missiles. BERSIBAY: Next slide, please. And. . . BRUMFIEL: The class was on for about an hour. And at the end, there's a test. I decide to take a crack at it. It's 20 multiple-choice questions - looks a little like a drivers' test, except full of acronyms. All right. Question one. Hmm. OK. Acronym, acronym, acronym, acronym. . . Missile launch officers have to take three of these tests every month. And on every one, they're expected to score at least 90 percent, which I found out, even after you've sat through the class, isn't easy. Captain Eric Lopez tells me the bad news. CAPTAIN ERIC LOPEZ: I've never seen anyone score that low. Based on this, I'm going to have to decertify you as a code handler. BRUMFIEL: The Air Force discovered that officers at Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana were texting each other answers to these tests. Commanders reacted quickly. Every officer at all three of the missile bases was retested on the spot. DANIEL SHARP: When the scandal broke up, we walked in cold. And the average scores over 95 percent. BRUMFIEL: That's Lieutenant Daniel Sharp, a launch officer at F. E. Warren. So if every officer got a near-perfect score without cheating, why was there cheating in the first place? Sharp says, it wasn't about launch procedures. It was about careers and how to get ahead. Officers sitting in the bunkers are usually fresh recruits just getting started. Until recently, promotion depended on doing better than the 90 percent passing score. SHARP: I was told that if I got a 90 on a test, that I was a D student, and I would be treated that way. That was the cause of the cheating scandal. It was feeling like I needed to get a 100 percent, and that's why I'm here, and that's my only purpose or my only way to further myself of this career field. BRUMFIEL: Lieutenant Sharp says, he never cheated, and officials never found evidence of cheating at this base, F. E. Warren. But NPR has spoken former officers there who say that they did cheat. And the Air Force acknowledges that cheating is part of a broader cultural problem at all three missile bases. Now the Air Force is trying to get rid of cheating by getting rid of grades. SHARP: All tests are now pass fail. The 90 percent passing standard is still there, but when your test scores are released, it's going to be a P or an F. So that completely removes the ability to stratify people based on a score - based on a number on a piece of paper. BRUMFIEL: And there's a new focus on practical skills. LIEUTENANT A. J. BECKNER: I have a message. LIEUTENANT PATRICK ROMANOFSKI: All right. We agree. We are authorized to launch our missiles. BECKNER: I agree. ROMANOFSKI: All right. Let's get launch key. BECKNER: Launch key. BRUMFIEL: Lieutenants Patrick Romanofski and A. J. Beckner sit in a full-scale replica of an underground nuclear command bunker. Instructors can watch as the two-man team practices the launch of nuclear armed missiles with the turn of the key. ROMANOFSKI: All right. On my countdown - five, four, three, two, one - key turn. BRUMFIEL: How these two perform in this simulator will play a greater role in their future promotions. This is a big change for the missile business. Lieutenant Colonel Barry Little oversees training here at the base. LIEUTENANT COLONEL BARRY LITTLE: You know, there was a tagline that's been with missiles for probably 40 years - that perfection is the standard. BRUMFIEL: But he says, that standard was always unrealistic because individuals do make mistakes. And nuclear missiles aren't launched by one person. It actually takes multiple turns of the key before a warhead leaves the silo. LITTLE: In reality, we don't expect them to be perfect. As a team, they make the right decisions. But as individuals, they're not required to be perfect. BRUMFIEL: Little says, with the elimination of grades, other factors, such as reputation and performance in the field, will be used to decide who gets promoted. And that, the Air Force hopes, will reduce the temptation to cheat. Jeff Brumfiel, NPR News.

BRUMFIEL: How these two perform in this simulator will play a greater role in their future promotions. This is a big change for the missile business. Lieutenant Colonel Barry Little oversees training here at the base. LIEUTENANT COLONEL BARRY LITTLE: You know, there was a tagline that's been with missiles for probably 40 years - that perfection is the standard. BRUMFIEL: But he says, that standard was always unrealistic because individuals do make mistakes. And nuclear missiles aren't launched by one person. It actually takes multiple turns of the key before a warhead leaves the silo. LITTLE: In reality, we don't expect them to be perfect. As a team, they make the right decisions. But as individuals, they're not required to be perfect. BRUMFIEL: Little says, with the elimination of grades, other factors, such as reputation and performance in the field, will be used to decide who gets promoted. And that, the Air Force hopes, will reduce the temptation to cheat. Jeff Brumfiel, NPR News.

They travel nearly the entire span between the South Pole and the North Pole. But changes in climate along the birds' route are putting the species at risk, so much so that the federal government believes this remarkable bird is threatened with extinction. NPR's Elizabeth Shogren explains why. ELIZABETH SHOGREN, BYLINE: Every year, thousands of red knots stop at beaches along the Delaware Bay to feed as they fly north. A crew of biologists, led by Kevin Kalasz, has set a trap for them. KEVIN KALASZ: Three, two, one - fire. SHOGREN: Explosives launch a huge net. It falls on of hundreds of birds and traps them. About a dozen people pop out of hiding places in a marsh and dash to collect the birds. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Do you have a knot box? They're moaning - (imitating birds). They sound so pitiful. SHOGREN: These biologists and volunteers are catching the birds to monitor their health. Red knot numbers are down by about three quarters since the 1980s. These birds are on their way to the Arctic from the bottom of South America - 9,300 miles. They stop here because they're starving. Kalasz holds a robin-sized bird with a long bill and cinnamon-colored breast. KALASZ: So this red knot - very skinny. I can feel almost its entire breastbone. Feel right there. SHOGREN: Oh, my goodness. It's so skinny. There's no meat on its bones. KALASZ: There's no meat. Yeah. SHOGREN: They come here because this is where a strange, prehistoric-looking animal called the horseshoe crab comes to lay its eggs. More spawn here than anywhere else in the world. KALASZ: I mean, there isn't anything better for these birds to eat. These little tiny horseshoe crab eggs are just packed full of fat. SHOGREN: The red knots' migration is an exquisitely timed act of nature. The crabs and the birds have to arrive at the same time, if the birds are going to get enough to eat. But biologists worry a changing climate could throw this rendezvous out of sync. Warming water temperatures could trigger the crabs to lay eggs before the birds arrive. What's more, rising seas and bigger storms are washing away the beaches. And Wendy Walsh from the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service says the danger doesn't stop here. WENDY WALSH: Climate change threat to the red knot is one that's throughout its range. SHOGREN: Including the Arctic, where it nests. WALSH: Warming in the Arctic we know is proceeding faster than most other parts of the globe. SHOGREN: The Fish and Wildlife Service can't do much about the Arctic. What it can do is protect the bird along the East Coast, in places, for example, like North Carolina's Outer Banks, a strip of low-lying islands. That's where some of the birds stop or even stay for the winter. Warren Judge chairs a local county commission on the Outer Banks. He says, the beaches already get closed to protect other rare shorebirds. JUDGE: The red knot is just another bird that can land someplace and create another closure. Our tourism is based upon the beach. It's very hard on the economy. SHOGREN: He says, every time they close a beach, they're closing a great place to fish, surf or play. The Fish and Wildlife Service's Wendy Walsh says, it's true. If the red knot goes on the endangered species list, beaches could be closed briefly every year, and that's not all. Her agency could discourage communities from doing things such as building sea walls. WALSH: This is totally understandable why humans would do this, when they have valuable infrastructure and property and lives at stake behind the walls, but that is a threat to the red knot going forward. SHOGREN: Biologists say other animals, from polar bears to butterflies, face similar dilemmas. Climate change is altering their environment. The government is expected to act on the red knot in late September. That's when the birds will be making their fall migration from the top of the globe back to the bottom.

SHAPIRO: \"Dr. Strangelove,\" the 1964 film, is a dark comedy about the Cold War. Today, the threat seems more remote. Still - some men and women keep America ready for nuclear war. They're the officers with a finger on the button. And they've learned to live with this grave responsibility. To see what the job is like, NPR's Geoff Brumfiel got a ride to a remote nuclear command bunker in Nebraska. GEOFF BRUMFIEL, BYLINE: Some most powerful weapons in the U. S. military can be found just off of the Interstate-80. (SOUNDBITE OF ENGINE STARTING)CAPTAIN JOSEPH SHANNON: Taking these vehicles out on long distances - they have a lot of miles on them right now. So, we want to make sure we're safe before driving out. BRUMFIEL: That's Captain Joseph Shannon of the Air Force's 90th missile wing. The missiles are scattered along the highways and back roads of Wyoming, Nebraska and Colorado. Captain Shannon is about to take command of 10 weapons for a 24-hour shift. Even his drive to the site is done by the book. SHANNON: So you check the oil, make sure the battery looks good and check all the belts and what not. (SOUNDBITE OF CAR HOOD SLAMMING)BRUMFIEL: We climb into this Ford Taurus with 168,000 miles on it. SHANNON: It's 11-6 departing for foxtrot 0-1. Lieutenant Bansal's the driver. LIEUTENANT RAJ BANSAL: It's going to be about an hour and a half. BRUMFIEL: Lieutenant Raj Bansal is the second member of this two-man crew. Bansal is fresh out of college in the Air Force's ROTC program. Now he's trained to launch nuclear armed missiles. He wonders if that order will ever come. BANSAL: I think it's something everybody thinks about when they get the job. I mean, you're basically eating most of your meals when you're on alert next to the keys and switches that would cause that act. BRUMFIEL: That act - it's hard for even these officers to discuss a nuclear exchange. And these days, most Americans don't talk about it at all. Lieutenant Bansal's friends know where he works, but they don't really have a clue what he does. BANSAL: A lot of them are like - hey, well, why are you complaining? You don't really do anything. (Laughing)BRUMFIEL: And that is the strange thing about nuclear deterrence. These two train constantly to launch a massive nuclear strike at a moment's notice. Their job is centered around being able to carry out that one order - an order they'll probably never get. Though that's not exactly how Captain Shannon sees it. SHANNON: Yeah, I wouldn't say our job is not to do something. The job of deterrence is actually working. Adversaries know that the missiles are here. They're in place. And they will be used. If it's sitting in the back of their mind, they won't do certain actions to cause them to be used. BRUMFIEL: To make the weapons harder to destroy in a nuclear war, the missiles and the bunkers controlling them are scattered across the countryside past Dix, Nebraska. SHANNON: Nine times out of ten you drive through these little towns you never see one person. BRUMFIEL: The road turns to gravel - high prairie in every direction. Eventually, we arrive at what looks like just another ranch house. SERGEANT RAYMOND KAISER: Please pay attention. I, Tech Sergeant Kaiser, will be your escort official during your visit. As your escort official, I'm required to brief escorted personnel on applicable security and safety rules before entry into this restricted area. BRUMFIEL: Sergeant Raymond Kaiser is responsible for maintaining the above-ground portion of this command center. It's home to a cook and support staff, as well as a heavily armed security force. KAISER: If you see something marked with a danger tag, please do not approach it. Please do not touch it. BRUMFIEL: Most of the missiles themselves are 60 feet underground. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: And just one last check - no unauthorized electronic devices. BRUMFIEL: Nope. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Door is open. BRUMFIEL: And at the entrance to the elevator, they've added a decorative touch - a giant mural of the cartoon plumber from the videogame Mario. The elevator is an old one with a lattice gate instead of a door. (SOUNDBITE OF ELEVATOR DOOR)BRUMFIEL: Through it you can see motifs from Super Mario Brothers all the way down - coins, flowers. At the bottom, Mario stands next to a mushroom cloud. Lieutenant Bansal opens an enormous two-foot-thick blast door - eight tons of steel. BANSAL: Stand clear. (SOUNDBITE OF WOOSH OF AIR)LIEUTENANT KIRSTEN CLARK: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to level eight of Super Mario World. I'm Lieutenant Clark, your guide. BRUMFIEL: Kirsten Clark and her deputy are just finishing their 24-hour alert down here in the bunker - the capsule, as crews call it. The room is hollowed out like a concrete egg. In the middle, suspended on shock absorbers, hangs the launch control center - a room within a room. It's long and narrow with a bed at one end and a toilet at the other. In between, two chairs face computer displays. Lieutenant Clark hands over her command to Captain Shannon. SHANNON: Security situations in progress? CLARK: There are no security situations in progress. SHANNON: Maintenance in progress or scheduled? CLARK: None. SHANNON: All right. And anything else helpful? CLARK: Let's see. We've got televisions working today for once. BRUMFIEL: TV is allowed down here. Crews have long periods of downtime where they still have to keep alert, especially at night. CLARK: Usually, I like movies 'cause they make the time go by faster. Sometimes I watch the cooking channel or the news. BRUMFIEL: Handover complete- Lieutenant Bansal and Captain Shannon are now the final link in a system stretching from the President of the United States to these missiles. BANSAL: And basically at this point in the day, we'd start our inspections. Since we have assumed responsibility for this alert, it's our responsibility to make sure that all the equipment is functioning as it was briefed to us. BRUMFIEL: Life down in the capsule can be busy - maintenance crews and security forces are coordinated from here. Communication is constantly kept up with U. S. strategic command, which would issue the president's launch order. The missiles themselves are displayed in a grid on the computer console. BANSAL: This is actually gaining status from 10 nuclear missiles, which is kind of crazy to think about. I mean, when you've been staring at the screen for about 80-some alerts, you kind of lose sight of what it actually is. BRUMFIEL: Each missile is just a tiny rectangle on the screen. It makes the enormity of this job seem small and abstract. And maybe the people we're asking to do this need it that way to let them get on with the day-to-day of keeping the weapons ready. Captain Shannon. SHANNON: There's no emotional thoughts going into this. It's our job and this is what we're going to do. Now, if we're topside actually seeing things, you know, I think that's totally different. But down here, you don't get the visual. I mean, this is what we see - something on the screen and that's it. BRUMFIEL: It's been a half-a-century since Dr. Strangelove's dark depiction of nuclear war. But in the capsule it still feels like 1964. The old telephone handsets, toggle switches and dials marked launch. It could be a set in Dr. Strangelove. BANSAL: I have it with me. (Laughing)BRUMFIEL: You have Dr. Strangelove with you? BANSAL: Uh-huh. (Laughing)BRUMFIEL: This is what nuclear deterrence comes down to - two officers 60-feet underground - working, watching old movies and waiting. (SOUNDBITE OF PHONE RINGING)BANSAL: Capsule, Lieutenant Bansal. BRUMFIEL: The lieutenant has work to do. It's time for us to head back to the world above.

They interviewed each other at StoryCorps booth in New York City and recalled a conversation they had in the 1980s when Jay first told Rita he was gay. This is probably a good time to mention that there are a number of, let's say, adult words in their chat we bleeped them out. RITA FISCHER: When called came out it was quite a shock. I had no inkling, none whatsoever. You tell me a you're gay and I said listen, give me a half an hour to come to myself and I'll call you back. And so I did call back, and I said this not telephone discussion, I think you best come speak with dad and I. But don't worry, we're going to love you the same way. JAY FISCHER: When you talked about not knowing about me being gay I mean, I consider you a lot of things but dumb isn't one of them. And I had left so many clues. R. FISCHER: I don't know what clues you're talking about. J. FISCHER: I had somebody over three times a week for five years. R. FISCHER: In my house? J. FISCHER: In your house. I had a [bleep] buddy. R. FISCHER: That's what you call them? [bleep] buddies? J. FISCHER: I call them a lot of things but. . . R. FISCHER: (Laughing) I don't know what you call them, but I didn't know and that's all. I would not be so dumb now. I have what they call gaydar. J. FISCHER: God bless. R. FISCHER: I can pick them up in a minute. And the very high point for me was when you Jay, and Michael had your commitment ceremony. Dad and I were celebrating our 50th wedding anniversary and you suggested that we may get a joint celebration. And when dad and I walked you down that aisle, I was so overwhelmed that I thought I was going to drop dead from a heart attack. It was one of my bursting moments of pride. J.

And so I did call back, and I said this not telephone discussion, I think you best come speak with dad and I. But don't worry, we're going to love you the same way. JAY FISCHER: When you talked about not knowing about me being gay I mean, I consider you a lot of things but dumb isn't one of them. And I had left so many clues. R. FISCHER: I don't know what clues you're talking about. J. FISCHER: I had somebody over three times a week for five years. R. FISCHER: In my house? J. FISCHER: In your house. I had a [bleep] buddy. R. FISCHER: That's what you call them? [bleep] buddies? J. FISCHER: I call them a lot of things but. . . R. FISCHER: (Laughing) I don't know what you call them, but I didn't know and that's all. I would not be so dumb now. I have what they call gaydar. J. FISCHER: God bless. R. FISCHER: I can pick them up in a minute. And the very high point for me was when you Jay, and Michael had your commitment ceremony. Dad and I were celebrating our 50th wedding anniversary and you suggested that we may get a joint celebration. And when dad and I walked you down that aisle, I was so overwhelmed that I thought I was going to drop dead from a heart attack. It was one of my bursting moments of pride. J. FISCHER: I consider you a blessing to both me and Michael, and that's as best as I can put it. I think straight parents should be involved with their gay children. I told everybody and anybody who would listen to me that I had a gay son, and that I was very proud of my gay son. MARTIN: That was Rita Fischer speaking with her son Jay, in New York.

JENNIFER SENIOR: Oh, yeah. RAZ: This is writer Jennifer Senior. SENIOR: And it's very funny; I don't know when you came of age - I mean, I was parented at a time when the basic theory was, get on your bike, ride around the neighborhood and at 6 o'clock, I will bang a gong and you will come back inside. RAZ: Jennifer's a mom and the author of a book on what she calls the crisis of modern parenting. And the title - \"All Joy And No Fun. \" And it's about the effect that children have on their mom's and dads. SENIOR: There was a pair of people in my book, Angie and Clint, these really relatable, wonderful parents. And I asked each of them what was harder, being a mother and father or, you know, doing their day job? And when I asked Angie, she said, oh, I find it much more confusing to be at home, whereas I feel very competent in my paid work. And her paid work was - she was a psychiatric nurse. She got screamed at; she had to deal with people who were having psychotic breaks. People would bite; they would yell; they would kick. But she felt more competent and in control and confident there than she did at home. And I said, why is that? And she said because, you know, I know what I'm doing there, and I'm not quite sure what I'm doing here. RAZ: And in the course of writing her book, Jennifer found that a lot of parents are really stressed out about how their kids will turn out. Here's Jennifer Senior on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SENIOR: Why is it that raising our children is associated with so much anguish and so much confusion? Why is it that we are at sixes and sevens about the one thing human beings have been doing successfully for millennia, long before parenting message boards and peer-reviewed studies came along? Why is it that so many mothers and fathers experience parenthood as a kind of crisis? There has been plenty of scholarship documenting a pretty clear pattern of parental anguish. Parents experience more stress than nonparents; their marital satisfaction is lower. There have been a number of studies looking at how parents feel when they're spending time with their kids. And the answer often is not so great. RAZ: So that's really the word you'd use for parenthood, a crisis? SENIOR: People experience it as one. I mean, actually, there is in fact no crisis. Our kids are born with lots of privileges that kids everywhere else in the world don't have. But we experience parenthood as a crisis for sure. And I think it's because modern parenthood - the way that we parent now is pretty new. And that's because childhood as we know it is really only about 70 years old. And nobody really realizes this, but until fairly recently, kids worked, which is not ethical, but it's how it was. What that meant is that we didn't give a whole lot of thought to parenting. RAZ: In a moment, Jennifer Senior explores the question - can parents produce happy kids? I'm Guy Raz, stay with us. This is the TED Radio Hour from NPR. (MUSIC)RAZ: It's the TED Radio Hour from NPR, I'm Guy Raz. And today on the show, we're asking the impossible question - what's harder, growing up or being a parent? We pick up with writer Jennifer Senior, who thinks it was probably easier to raise kids in the old days and harder in some ways to be a kid. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SENIOR: Until fairly recently, kids worked - on our farms primarily, but also in factories, mills, mines - kids were considered economic assets. Sometime during the Progressive Era, we recognized kids had rights. We banned child labor, and school became a child's new work. And thank God it did. But that only made a parent's role more confusing in a way. Once kids stopped working, the economics of parenting changed. Kids became, in the words of one brilliant, if totally ruthless sociologist, economically worthless but emotionally priceless. (LAUGHTER)SENIOR: Rather than them working for us, we began to work for them because within only a matter of decades, it became clear - if we wanted our kids to succeed, school is not enough. Extracurricular activities are a kid's new work. That's work for us, too, because we're the ones driving them to soccer practice. Massive piles of homework are a kids new work. But that's also work for us because we have to check it. About three years ago, a Texas woman told something to me that totally broke my heart. She said, almost casually, homework is the new dinner. RAZ: But, I mean, it's not just homework - right? - that's stressing parents out. SENIOR: Well, the world is changing very, very, very, very rapidly. We don't have any clue what we're training our kids for. We just know that we have to make them prepared for some future. So we send them to violin lessons, or we teach them how to code because the world is going to be written in HTML, or we teach them another language because the world going forward is going to be multilingual. Oh, and above all, though, we know that we have to shore up their self-esteem. By the way, no matter what we do, we have to make them feel good. RAZ: Yeah, you're really good at violin. SENIOR: Yeah (laughing). (SOUNDBITE OF VIOLIN)RAZ: He's getting better? SENIOR: Yeah, exactly (laughing). (SOUNDBITE OF VIOLIN)SENIOR: And this is all new. No one used to - you know, in 1850, no one was freaking out about sleep training. No one was flipping out about whether or not their kid had enough self-esteem and whether they got a soccer trophy. You know, in 1850, this looked really different. RAZ: But, I mean, another reason we do all these things is because we love our kids. I mean, like you said in your talk - they're priceless to us, more priceless to us than they were in 1850. SENIOR: Right. We now assign a very high value to our kids. We have very few of them. I mean, we don't have our kids now until we're 30 years old. So - God, so much is riding on that. I mean, we now look forward to having kids the way that Jane Austin heroines looked forward to marriage. It's this great thing that we are working toward and it's like the capstone to our lives now essentially. And so we have all those expectations of parenthood and what kind of happiness it's going to bring us, but we also have this enormous expectation for our children. We want them so much to be happy. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SENIOR: Our kids' happiness is paramount. That is what it means to raise kids in an age when they are economically worthless, but emotionally priceless. The one mantra no parent ever questions is, all I want is for my children to be happy. And don't get me wrong, I think happiness is a wonderful goal, but it is a very elusive one. Happiness and self-confidence, teaching children that is not like teaching them how to plow a field. It's not like teaching them how to ride a bike. Happiness and self-confidence can be the byproducts of other things, but they cannot be goals on to themselves. A child's happiness is a very unfair burden to place on a parent. And happiness is an even more unfair burden to place on a kid. RAZ: But that's like natural and normal, right? I mean, we all want our kids to be happy. SENIOR: It is. It is the one thing we all agree on. I mean, I tie myself up in knots about wanting my kid to be happy. But here's the thing, some kids aren't going to be happy, it doesn't matter what you do. You know, maybe constitutionally that's not who they are, right? The most you can do is create kind of circumstances that would enable them to feel productive or feel like they were helpful to others. But to actually single-handedly take responsibility for their happiness is super tough. RAZ: Do you think that parents now are just - I don't know - I mean, they're trying to do it right. They're trying to improve on everything that came before them. SENIOR: Totally. RAZ: And so is it possible that they're doing it right? SENIOR: I think everybody gets so balled up thinking that there is a right way, I think it's really anxiety provoking. And, you know, what is orthodoxy for one generation, or even a half generation, or even for three years, is overturned three years later. And so when I was out in Stanford reading it from my book, you know, a dean came running up to me afterwards and said all of our freshmen are showing up under constructed - that was her word. It was a great word. You know, they've been over parented. And I thought, oh, God, good Lord. But we all thought we were under parented, what's - what's medium parented? Can we do this medium rare, medium well? I don't know. I mean, I just - it's very, very, very hard on people I think to figure out where this middle ground is. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SENIOR: In our desperate quest to create happy kids, we may be assuming the wrong moral burden. It's strikes me as a better goal, and dare I say a more virtuous one, to focus on making productive kids and moral kids and to simply hope that happiness will come to them by virtue of the good that they do and they're accomplishments and the love that they feel from us. That is one response to having no script. Absent of having new scripts, we just follow the oldest ones in the book. Decency, a work ethic, love - I think if we all did that, the kids would still be all right, and so would their parents - possibly in both cases even better. (APPLAUSE)RAZ: Jennifer Senior, her book is called \"All Joy And No Fun: The Paradox Of Modern Parenthood. \" Check out her entire TED talk at ted. com.

How would you do it, and what would that sound like? Well, those questions have been answered by researchers at MIT and elsewhere. It's all about tiny vibrations - so small you can't see them with your eyes. But there is movement, and that movement can be converted into sound. The scientists described the process as turning visible objects, such as a house plant or a bag of potato chips into visual microphones. The first author on the paper is MIT graduate student Abe Davis, and he joins me now to explain how this works. Abe, welcome to the program. ABE DAVIS: Hi, thanks for having me. BLOCK: And let me see if I've gotten this right. The idea is that sound waves will cause an object to vibrate. You are capturing that vibration on video and then - this is the tricky part - you're turning that vibration back into sound. Am I close? DAVIS: Yeah, that's pretty accurate. BLOCK: OK, well let's take a listen to what this sounds like. You played a song to a house plant, and the song sounded like this. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"MARY HAD A LITTLE LAMB\")BLOCK: And Abe, what are we hearing there? DAVIS: Well, that's the sound that we played out of the speaker, and, you know, it created these fluctuations in air pressure. And when those fluctuations in air pressure hit the object they move the object a very, very, very small amount. And usually we can't see that, but it turns out that it does create this very, very, very miniscule changes in video. And if you look at the video locally - if you just look at some - one part of the plant in the image that you see, then you can't really get the sound from that one part. But if you start to combine all these tiny noisy signals from all across the surface of an object, then you can start to filter out some of that noise and you can actually recover the sound that produced that motion. BLOCK: So when you filtered out the noise - you had a camera on the plant, you took the image of those vibrations, you captured it in a computer, and somehow with this algorithm you were able to generate sound. And here's what it sounded like. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"MARY HAD A LITTLE LAMB\")BLOCK: So deep in their, Abe, we're hearing \"Mary Had A Little Lamb. \" I'm not sure how it happened, but we are. DAVIS: Yeah. That's kind of what the plant heard - or really, more accurately, what the plant felt. All sound creates these vibrations when it comes into contact with an object. BLOCK: Well, Abe let's listen to another example. You tried out human speech on a bag of potato chips. So here's what went in, in terms of the sound. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Mary had a little lamb whose fleece was white as snow. BLOCK: And here is what you extracted. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Mary had a little lamb whose fleece was white as snow. BLOCK: Were you surprised when that was the result, Abe, when you first heard that? DAVIS: Yes. Well, sort of - I mean, that wasn't the first experiment that we did where we recovered human speech. I do remember that the first time that we recovered really clear speech, I had to keep double checking to make sure that I hadn't, you know, mixed up my signals or something. BLOCK: Abe, what are you thinking about when you think about practical uses for what you've done here? What do you - where does take you? DAVIS: Most people - when they hear about this work, their mind sort of immediately goes to espionage and spying. BLOCK: The idea there would be you could take video that has no sound and somehow extract what the conversation was in that video? DAVIS: Yeah. I mean, in some situations I think that you could do that. When people hear about what we do here, it's easy to imagine that it would just kind of work in any arbitrary situation, and that's not exactly the case. I mean, what we do is limited. I think there are a lot of things that we could potentially do with it, but a lot of that is stuff that's going to hopefully be fleshed out in future work.

NPR science correspondent Joe Palca has been bringing us stories about the science of how things fold and unfold. He saw a report today in the journal \"Science. \" It's about engineers who got a flat sheet of paper to fold itself into a robot, so Joe's going to tell us about how this all - well, unfolded. JOE PALCA, BYLINE: The engineers started with a straightforward goal. SAM FELTON: We wanted to try and make robots and machines in general as quickly and cheaply as possible. PALCA: That's Sam Felton. He's a graduate student at the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. FELTON: One way to do that is to start with a flat sheet because it's very fast and it's relatively cheap to make flat things. PALCA: And now you can print and electronic circuits on a flat sheet of paper, for example. And if you use some clever folding techniques - techniques based on the ancient art of paper folding called origami, you can fold these sheets into useful structures - maybe a crab-shaped robot that can scuttle across the floor or a bird-shaped robot that could really fly. Problem is, it takes a long time for humans to make all the complicated folds in these flat sheets. FELTON: Our goal then, was to try and make them fold themselves in order to save time. PALCA: So Felton and his colleagues printed hinges onto their flat sheets of paper and then attached a tiny microprocessor to the sheet. FELTON: And it tells each hinge when to fold into place. PALCA: Sounds simple, but I told Felton I thought I saw a problem with his scheme. Most of the pieces of paper that I've used, even if they have electronic circuits on it, will not fold if you just tell it to. FELTON: Of course, so our self-folding technology uses something called shape memory polymers which you might be familiar with as Shrinky Dinks. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Welcome to the magical land of Shrinky Dinks. PALCA: Shrinky Dinks? FELTON: Yes. PALCA: What? I'm sorry. Maybe I missed those in my youth, but what's a Shrinky Dink? FELTON: It's alright. I never played with them either. It's a sheet of plastic, and the idea is that kids can draw on them and put them in the oven, and they'll shrink by 50 percent in either direction. In our case, we attached this to paper. . . PALCA: And when the microprocessor wants to execute a particular fold, it turns on a tiny electronic heater printed on the paper, causing the Shrinky Dink to shrink. FELTON: And this, in turn, pulls on the paper, causing the paper fold. PALCA: You can watch Felton's folding robot do its folding thing at our website, npr. org. Felton is now working on tiny, bug-sized folding robots that could - I don't know - crawl into tight spaces and check for damage. Felton says you could also make larger things that fold autonomously, and I'd like to encourage him to think in that direction. How about clothes that fold themselves when they come out of the laundry? Now, that would be really welcome. Joe Palca, NPR News.

The colors help attract mates and fend off predators. But how those hues evolved has been a bit of a mystery. As NPR's Rae Ellen Bichell reports, scientists now say they've gotten a glimpse of how butterflies make their colors and how quickly they can change. RAE ELLEN BICHELL, BYLINE: Zoom down to the surface of a soft, smooth looking butterfly wing and a biologist Antonia Monterio says it's actually covered in rugged, textured scales. ANTONIA MONTERIO: That overlap like shingles on the roof. BICHELL: Zoom in even more to the nanoscale and you'd find a labyrinth of hard, transparent architecture - pillars, ridges, archways, sometimes even spiral tulips. MONTERIO: And all kinds of other intricate things all made out of chitin. BICHELL: That's the same material that makes crab shells so tough. In butterflies, the way those chitin structures bend and reflect light is what creates such an extraordinary range of bright colors. Beams of light come in and ricochet off the scaly maze in all directions. MONTERIO: As they bounce these structures, they go through the process of constructive interference or destructive interference. BICHELL: It all has to do with geometry and spacing. Tweak those, and you change the wavelengths reflecting back out, which gives different colors. The question was - what exactly would have to change in those tiny, transparent structures to make a dull looking butterfly brilliant? And how long would it take? Monterio decided there was only one way to find out - to try to do it in the lab. MONTERIO: To try and evolve color. BICHELL: Monterio, who's now at the National University of Singapore, teamed up with some Yale physicists and picked a butterfly species called the squinting bush brown. It lives up to its dull name - goes well with tree bark. But it has some flashy close cousins with streaks of blue and violet on their wings. MONTERIO: So we wondered whether this specific species that was not showing any of those colors, could also evolve those colors if we forced it to through artificial selection. BICHELL: So here's what they did - some of the dull brown butterfly wings did reflect slightly shorter wavelengths of light. MONTERIO: Meaning towards the bluer wavelengths of the light spectrum, and we mated those individuals with each other. BICHELL: One year and six generations later, they had bred squinting bush browns that were sporting purpley streaks across their wings. Monterio was surprised to find that the new decor was the result of only very slight changes to the scales. The chitin had become a smidge thicker. MONTERIO: It seems to be incredibly easy to evolve these new colors in butterflies. BICHELL: So should this modest brown butterfly species need to adapt, it has a powerful color technology in his back pocket - tweak a little chitin and boom - from brown to brilliant. Monterio's work was published this week in the journal proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Rae Ellen Bichell, NPR News.

It's amazing to be in shouting distance of magnificent, wild animals but it's hard not to get the feeling that the great apes, big cats and other creatures don't exactly love being behind bars and walls. Now a Danish architectural firm is working with a zoo safari in Denmark to break down those walls and create what they're calling Zootopia. Architect Bjarke Ingels runs the architecture firm The Bjarke Ingels Group, or B. I. G. He's designing the zoo. Welcome to the program. BJARKE INGELS: Thank you. RATH: So you're known already for big ideas at B. I. G. Before we talk about the zoo, could you tell us about your other innovative designs for buildings? INGELS: Right now we're building a power plant in Denmark that turns waste into electricity and district heating. But it's also made in such a way that you can actually hike on its roof. It's a giant public park. And in the winter you can ski on it. RATH: Nice. So why did you decide to take on the zoo? INGELS: For the zoo it's almost a question of trying to find ways of actually creating a successful cohabitation between humans and different species of animals. We've done a lot of homes for humans. To get to work for new species would be a great challenge. RATH: So this is in the concept stage right now. But can you describe what it's going to be like to walk into Zootopia? INGELS: First of all to understand Zootopia you have to understand that in Zootopia there's only going to be social animals. You won't have a lonely tiger walking around inside a cage. You'll have gorillas, you'll have wolves - all kinds of animals that like to be together in larger groups. So we can actually create entire habitats. And then secondly we've organized it in such a way that you start by arriving in something that almost looks like a giant tilted crater. You can walk along the rim of the crater and get amazing views out over the entire landscape of Zootopia. And then from this crater there'll be three giant gates that you can move through that will bring you in to either America, Asia or Africa. We have organized Asia so that you can visit it with water bicycles. You can bicycle through the area that is Africa and then you can actually take a cable car through the area that is America. So essentially the idea is interfacing with the animals in completely new ways. RATH: How close though can you interface with an animal like a lion when there aren't, you know, traditional walls and bars? I mean, how do you work that out with - talk about some different animals, like the lion for instance? INGELS: You'll still be able to drive through the Lion Park with your car in the traditional car-safari way. What we're basically looking at is to find different ways of hiding the barriers between the people and the animals and in this case what we've tried to do is to eliminate all traces of human architecture, so there are no buildings. You'll see rolling hills growing over the areas where the lions have to retreat when the winter gets cold in Denmark. And in a similar way using combinations of level changes changes, trenches with water where the water depth prevents certain animals from crossing - in the case of the bears, your cable car might actually come really close to the bears above them but it won't bring you within range. So you can say both a human experience and the animal experience is going to be much more exciting. I really do think that if you can make great zoos where so many different species can live in close proximity in harmony, you can also make great cities. RATH: Look forward to seeing this. INGELS: Yeah. Come over in five years. RATH: Great. Architect Bjarke Ingels runs the architectural firm B. I. G. Thanks for your time today. INGELS: It was a pleasure.

A study out this week finds that music with a heavy baseline makes people feel more powerful. It's the secret behind pump up songs. Adam Galinsky is one of the study's authors. He explained how the experiment worked. ADAM GALINSKY: We had a number of different individuals listen to a variety of different songs and we just asked them to rate how much did that song make you feel power? And then what we did in our study is we just took three songs that were rated as making people feel the most powerful - \"We Will Rock You\" by Queen, \"Get Ready For This\" 2 Unlimited, \"In The Club\" 50 Cent. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"IN THE CLUB\")50 CENT: (Singing) Go shorty, it's your birthday. We going to party like it's your birthday. GALINSKY: And three songs that people rated as making them feel the least powerful - \"Because We Can\" by Fatboy Slim, \"We Let The Dogs Out\" by Baha Men and \"Big Poppa\" Notorious B. I. G. RATH: OK. So then you asked people in the study to do tasks while they listened to either the high power songs or the low-power songs. What sort of things were they doing? GALINSKY: So here's one of the tasks we did. People come in and they have an opportunity to roll a die. And if they get the number they yell out before the die gets rolled they get $5. So they're highly motivated, they want to win, you know, they want to get the right number. But we give them a choice - do you want to roll the die yourself or do you want the experimenter to roll the die? And what we find is usually, you know, a little bit more than 50 percent of people want to roll the die themselves but in our case when people listen to high-powered music they wanted to roll the die themselves 86 percent of the time. And so what you can see here is it's making people sort of more action oriented. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"IN THE CLUB\")50 CENT: (Singing) My money on my mind. Got a mil out the deal and I'm still in the grind. RATH: Is there a way to correct for other influences, like, how do you know it's not the lyrics or the volume or something else? >>(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"IN THE CLUB\")GALINSKY: Yeah. We can control for the amount of volume, for example, in the headsets and we match those all perfectly. We also then pretested the lyrics to make sure that just reading the lyrics didn't make people feel more powerful. What we did in our final study is we said, well, can we isolate the bass sound? Because deep voices tend to be associated with power. And we know that bigger, stronger bodies tend to produce deeper voices and so what we did and we took a piece of music that no one had ever heard before. And was simply manipulated the amount of bass that was in the music. And what we found was that when the song had higher bass in the music that actually made them feel more powerful. RATH: You basically just cranked up the bass knob for the same song? GALINSKY: Yeah, basically, just cranked up the bass knob. (SOUNDBITE OF UNIDENTIFIED SONG)RATH: What does feeling more powerful do for you? Do you do better at certain things? Do you have more energy and stamina? GALINSKY: Yeah. I think, I mean, all those things. People who have been made to feel more powerful can endure more pain. We've shown that if you prime people to think about power before they walk into an interview they're, like, more than twice as likely to get these or business school applications - but, get selected into the business school than if they had thought about a time when they had low-power. I think music is a really interesting one because music can not only make you feel you powerful but make the whole group feel powerful. RATH: So individual application might be listen to Skrillex or some dub step before a big job interview? GALINSKY: Yeah. One of the things I think is what you want to do as an individual was find the piece of music that makes you feel powerful. It may be music that helps you do this, it may be the superwoman pose. You want to find the thing that works for you. But there's something out there that can work for everyone. RATH: Adam Galinsky is a psychologist at Columbia Business School.

And this summer has been no different. As soon as people head to the beach, interest in sharks picks up. The good news is shark attacks were actually down a bit last year compared with previous years. Even so, surfers, divers and others who spend a lot of time in the water have been buying electronic devices that help protect them against shark attacks. From Miami, NPR's Greg Allen reports. GREG ALLEN, BYLINE: There are two companies selling electronic anti-shark devices. One of them, Shark Shield, sells them at dive shops in Florida. DOUG AUSTIN: Actually, I just sold - just sent two out the door today that's going to some charter, I think, over in the Mediterranean. ALLEN: Doug Austin manages Austin's Diving Center in Miami, a shop that's popular with scuba divers who often encounter sharks while spear-fishing. Austin says, as predators, sharks are always on the lookout for the weak and wounded. AUSTIN: When you shoot a fish, he is now weak and wounded. They're flailing around and sometimes bleeding. And so the sharks will come in, and they will steal your fish. ALLEN: The people who use them, do they come back and talk to you about them? What kind of. . . AUSTIN: As long as they don't come back missing any limbs, I don't have a problem (laughter). ALLEN: Owner and general manager of Shark Shield, Amanda Wilson, says the technology is effective because of a characteristic peculiar to sharks; they're very sensitive to electromagnetic fields. AMANDA WILSON: Sharks have electrical receptors in their snout called the Ampullae of Lorenzini. And the waveform that our product creates, it actually induces spasms in the shark's snout. So they don't want to come within 15 to 20 feet of the person wearing a Shark Shield. ALLEN: Electronic shark deterrents were first developed more than 20 years ago. In that time, scientists have conducted thousands of hours of tests using chunks of fish and seal decoys protected by Shark Shields. Wilson says the tests show sharks recoil and avoid the device's electrical field. WILSON: Besides the scientific testing that's been done, we've got hundreds of testimonials from customers over the years that said, you know, a shark was charging me, a great white was charging me, and as soon as it got to 20 feet away, it was like it hit a brick wall and just turned around. ROBERT HUETER: The theory behind this device is solid. ALLEN: Robert Hueter is director of the Center for Shark Research at the Mote Marine Laboratory in Sarasota, Florida. He says the device might make sense for surfers, divers and others who spend a lot of time around sharks who don't mind spending $600 or $700 for the device. Hueter says the question with any sharp repellant is, will it work 100 percent of the time? HUETER: Sharks do habituate to different kinds of noxious stimuli, whether it's a smell or a sound or, in this case, an electrical burst essentially. Will they be repelled in all cases, or will one occasionally get through? ALLEN: Hueter says shark researchers don't use the devices because their work doesn't often expose them to attacks. But if you're planning a 100-mile-plus open-water swim from Cuba to Key West, Diana Nyad says sharks are definitely a worry. DIANA NYAD: Kicking on the surface, you're making low-frequency vibrations. So you're making, as a lot of shark experts will tell you, the sound of a dinner bell. ALLEN: Nyad completed her Havana-to-Key West swim nearly a year ago flanked by kayaks equipped with Shark Shield devices. But on her 53-hour long swim across the Florida Strait, Nyad was also accompanied by a rotating team of divers in the water to fend off sharks. NYAD: I want to be fair and say that I felt confident that the Shark Shield was a big part of our deterrent force. On the other hand, I wouldn't have gone with just the electricity way out there. I wanted my guys. ALLEN: Along with the Shark Shields and her team of divers, Nyad had a third line of defense. It's another new product, a chemical shark repellent sold in an aerosol can.

You might think, just scratch it and stop complaining. But our guest, Dr. Gil Yosipovitch, understands that itch can be as debilitating as pain. He's the chair of the Department of Dermatology at Temple University and is developing a center for itch there. He's also the founder of the International Forum for the Study of Itch. For years, he's been trying to get doctors in related fields such as neurology and oncology involved in researching new treatments for itch to change what he feels is a dismissive attitude among doctors that itch is the little brother of pain. Dr. Yosipovitch is also the co-author of the book, \"Living With Itch: A Patient's Guide. \" He spoke recently with Terry Gross. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)TERRY GROSS, HOST: Dr. Yosipovitch, welcome to FRESH AIR. You've been trying to create itch as a separate area of specialization. Why do you want itch to stand on its own as a field? GIL YOSIPOVITCH: I would say that I learned from my colleagues dealing with pain. A lot of the patients come with that complaint and we can't solve the underlying disease immediately, but they want us to treat their itch first and foremost. And I felt that, like our colleagues in pain that developed the concept that we first have to treat pain regardless of underlying disease, this has to be achieved also in itch. And in fact, we know that patients who have chronic itch, their quality of life is significantly affected by - very similar to patients who have chronic pain. GROSS: I think a lot of people don't understand that because pain  - I mean, pain is pain. And itch is supposed to be, oh, a little thing that you scratch, not a big deal. It doesn't hurt. So give us a sense of what kind of distress itch can cause. YOSIPOVITCH: When a patient can't sleep at nighttime and wakes up scratching himself all night long, it affects, significantly, his capability of coping and working and enjoying life. So it starts from infancy, where you have kids who have atopic eczema. They can't sleep. Their parents can't sleep. And it also causes a vicious cycle that - often itch, scratch cycle. Patients some (inaudible) I would prefer even having pain rather than having itch. And think about someone who has it constantly, day and night. GROSS: So, you know, there's the kind of basic itch you get - a mosquito bite, you get a rash, poison ivy. It itches for a while. It goes away. You can treat it and numb it when it's at its worst. But, you know, it's going to go away. But chronic itch doesn't go away. And it's very disturbing to the people who have it - interferes with sleep, interferes with other things as well. It's kind of itch gone berserk. So is the problem neurological? Like, is there something happening with the nervous system when you have that kind of chronic itch? YOSIPOVITCH: That's an excellent question. And indeed, the neural system is significantly involved. It transmits the itch signals from the skin, where itch emanates, up into the spinal cord and up to the brain. The nerves are acting wacky. They fire when these patients have chronic itch, and we become very sensitive. So even small activities or very minimal activities that usually would not cause us itch like changing our clothes or changes in temperature and environment or exposure to soaps, could irritate this system and the patient feels more itch. GROSS: So if we look at chronic pain and chronic itch, how are they similar? How are they different? YOSIPOVITCH: Well, both of them are unpleasant sensations. There's some unique difference and one of the unique differences is that, in pain we retract from the area where we have a painful stimuli. While itch, we actually scratch it. We induce bit of pain to relieve it. GROSS: Is that what we're doing when we're scratching - inducing pain to relieve the itch? YOSIPOVITCH: It's interesting. I think there are two aspects to it. Yes, there is a bit component of pain but there is also - and that's unique, I think, to itch - is that there is a component of pleasure and scratching an itch. We find it relieving, but there is something in addition. Our studies and other groups' may suggest that there is a - also a brain mechanism involved in pleasure of scratching an itch and they are involving in this repetitive behavior, so it's bit addictive to start scratching. And when a doctor tells a patient, stop scratching, it's easy to say that, but in fact, it's not easy to do because it really liberates - the scratching - some chemicals. Chemicals like opioids, like morphine-like. In fact, a lot of the patients say the only way to relieve her itch for a couple of hours is significant scratching. GROSS: But, I thought if you keep scratching an itch - because of the itch-scratch syndrome, is that what it's called? YOSIPOVITCH: Cycle. GROSS: Cycle, yeah. That you are going to make it worse if you have a bad inch. It's defeating to scratch it because you're not only going to scratch your skin and maybe even start bleeding, but also you're going to intensify the itch in the long run and you're just fooling yourself (laughter) if you think that scratching's going to help. YOSIPOVITCH: You're perfectly correct but, on the other hand, the immediate relief of scratching is something that - that's the purpose most probably, of scratching, is that relief of itch. I think evolutionally this most probably was related to something, that animals were using scratching to relieve insects that were bothering them. My ideal treatment would be to induce an activity that would be similar to scratching but not damaging the skin. When we scratch, we damage the skin to cause inflammation and to activate more of these nerve fibers. But the idea is, if we were able to induce the same activation in the brain of scratching and inducing it without damaging the skin, we may end up with a good treatment for chronic itch. GROSS: So let me see if I understand correctly - you're not only studying what happens in the brain when we have an itch, you're studying what happens in the brain when we scratch an itch and why that seems to produce a pleasure response. And you're trying to see if there's some kind of substitute we can use other than scratching, some kind of neurochemical thing, that we can do so it would relieve the itch by satisfying the brain? YOSIPOVITCH: That's correct. GROSS: That's so interesting. So are you thinking, like someday there's going to be a pill we can take that will basically do for the brain what scratching does? YOSIPOVITCH: Yes. I do. . . GROSS: (Laughter) That would be nice. YOSIPOVITCH: . . . Strongly believe in that. Always, with pills, you have to ask, so what are the side effects? So that's always something that we have to look into. But always, you have to outweigh the risk versus the benefits. And the benefit for a patient who cannot sleep at nighttime sometimes outweighs side effects. But we are on the verge of finding more drugs that are targeted approach for itch. And some of them work clearly on these mechanisms. GROSS: So we were talking earlier about some of the connections between pain and itch, in terms of the neurological system. So what are some of the implications for medicines? Like, in pain now there's a lot of work being done with things like Gabapentin, to try to slow down the nerve response so that the nerves aren't communicating all this pain. I'm putting this in really bad layperson's terms so you can elaborate on that and explain, but are medications like Gabapentin, which are used to kind of quiet the pain response, also being used to quiet the itch response? YOSIPOVITCH: I perfectly use them - agree with you - and perfectly use them as my treatments for patients with chronic itch. They don't work for all types, but those where there is neuropathic or damage to the nerve fibers, they work very well. Gabapentin or the Pregabalin; these are drugs that work for our patients. We sometimes use them in combination with other class of drugs from the anti-depression of those called Selective Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitor and it's not that our patients are depressed; they could be sometimes depressed due to horrible chronic itch, but because these drugs work in an additive effect, in reducing that sensitization what the nerve fibers as I mentioned, are acting wacky and firing. They reduce that firing of the nerve fibers, that's why it enables our patient to sleep better and to have less itch. So a lot of times I'm asked by other colleagues, why do you give antidepressant? Why do you give anticonvulsants like Gabapentin, Pregabalin, and I say, I give them because it really reduces the itch intensity and the suffering. So there is a lot of similarities here with chronic pain. GROSS: Since chronic pain and chronic itch are similar but different, are people who are prone to chronic pain also prone to chronic itch and vice versa? YOSIPOVITCH: There's not really an epidemiology study to suggest that, but I would say, from my experience, there are a lot of overlaps of people who have some types of chronic pain and they're in the same spectrum of chronic itch, and they could have chronic itch. This is not well mentioned, but for patients who have, for example, fibromyalgia, if it causes chronic pain, a lot of times they complain also of chronic itch. So it won't surprise me, people who have irritable bowel syndrome, which is another form of - all these aspects of disease have something in common - they have a hypersensitization of the nerve fibers and it's very similar to what I described before, with a patient with chronic itch is that the nerves are acting wacky; they're just firing all over. And that's why it's so severe and why it's so difficult to treat these patients. GROSS: You know, some people who have chronic pain syndromes say that their doctors are very dismissive. And you mentioned fibromyalgia; a lot of doctors don't even consider that a serious diagnosis. Does the same happen with chronic itch? Do you find that a lot of patients who come to you have been dismissed as having either imagined complaints, or neurotic complaints or exaggerated complaints? YOSIPOVITCH: I agree with you and I think, we in our profession as dermatologists like to see a lot of times, skin signs, rashes. And when a patient tells you that he has itch, that he cannot sleep and - I use, a lot of times, a intensity scale, what we call a visual analog scale and ask him, rate your itch. And I think, for us as dermatologists, it's sometimes very difficult to, if we don't see the scratch marks but the patient tells you, I suffer from horrible itch, it sometimes causes us to think that maybe he's exaggerating. But from my experiences, it's not what you see, it's what the patient complains of. I therefore believe strongly that we need to address itch as a disease - chronic itch as a disease - on its own state and understand our patients' suffering. GROSS: Now, you're a dermatologist, but a lot of itches you deal with aren't really about the skin - it's not a skin condition, it's not hives, it's not a bite, it's not a rash - it's something that's happening neurologically and you're trying to figure out, what is it that's happening neurologically? But again, it's not a skin issue, per se. YOSIPOVITCH: Well, I see it in the perspective of the skin. The skin is a sensory organ and has all the nerves. And the patients come because they think that the dermatologists have to solve it. And it's interesting - I don't want to be critical of my colleagues in neurology but - very few of neurologists are interested in some of those sensations. I would say that, I think one of the purposes of putting itch as a focus of my work is to raise awareness among other specialties, that they have to address this topic, including my colleagues in neurology, including other experts, even pain experts; that they have to understand that sometimes patients have both pain and itch, like, post Shingles. And they sometimes would dismiss the patient - say, oh, well if you have itch, I'm not bothered with it; we just want to deal with pain. But, I see that as part of the same spectrum. GROSS: Dr. Yosipovitch, thank you so much for talking with us. I appreciate it. YOSIPOVITCH: My pleasure.

And when a doctor tells a patient, stop scratching, it's easy to say that, but in fact, it's not easy to do because it really liberates - the scratching - some chemicals. Chemicals like opioids, like morphine-like. In fact, a lot of the patients say the only way to relieve her itch for a couple of hours is significant scratching. GROSS: But, I thought if you keep scratching an itch - because of the itch-scratch syndrome, is that what it's called? YOSIPOVITCH: Cycle. GROSS: Cycle, yeah. That you are going to make it worse if you have a bad inch. It's defeating to scratch it because you're not only going to scratch your skin and maybe even start bleeding, but also you're going to intensify the itch in the long run and you're just fooling yourself (laughter) if you think that scratching's going to help. YOSIPOVITCH: You're perfectly correct but, on the other hand, the immediate relief of scratching is something that - that's the purpose most probably, of scratching, is that relief of itch. I think evolutionally this most probably was related to something, that animals were using scratching to relieve insects that were bothering them. My ideal treatment would be to induce an activity that would be similar to scratching but not damaging the skin. When we scratch, we damage the skin to cause inflammation and to activate more of these nerve fibers. But the idea is, if we were able to induce the same activation in the brain of scratching and inducing it without damaging the skin, we may end up with a good treatment for chronic itch. GROSS: So let me see if I understand correctly - you're not only studying what happens in the brain when we have an itch, you're studying what happens in the brain when we scratch an itch and why that seems to produce a pleasure response. And you're trying to see if there's some kind of substitute we can use other than scratching, some kind of neurochemical thing, that we can do so it would relieve the itch by satisfying the brain? YOSIPOVITCH: That's correct. GROSS: That's so interesting. So are you thinking, like someday there's going to be a pill we can take that will basically do for the brain what scratching does? YOSIPOVITCH: Yes. I do. . . GROSS: (Laughter) That would be nice. YOSIPOVITCH: . . . Strongly believe in that. Always, with pills, you have to ask, so what are the side effects? So that's always something that we have to look into. But always, you have to outweigh the risk versus the benefits. And the benefit for a patient who cannot sleep at nighttime sometimes outweighs side effects. But we are on the verge of finding more drugs that are targeted approach for itch. And some of them work clearly on these mechanisms. GROSS: So we were talking earlier about some of the connections between pain and itch, in terms of the neurological system. So what are some of the implications for medicines? Like, in pain now there's a lot of work being done with things like Gabapentin, to try to slow down the nerve response so that the nerves aren't communicating all this pain. I'm putting this in really bad layperson's terms so you can elaborate on that and explain, but are medications like Gabapentin, which are used to kind of quiet the pain response, also being used to quiet the itch response? YOSIPOVITCH: I perfectly use them - agree with you - and perfectly use them as my treatments for patients with chronic itch. They don't work for all types, but those where there is neuropathic or damage to the nerve fibers, they work very well. Gabapentin or the Pregabalin; these are drugs that work for our patients. We sometimes use them in combination with other class of drugs from the anti-depression of those called Selective Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitor and it's not that our patients are depressed; they could be sometimes depressed due to horrible chronic itch, but because these drugs work in an additive effect, in reducing that sensitization what the nerve fibers as I mentioned, are acting wacky and firing. They reduce that firing of the nerve fibers, that's why it enables our patient to sleep better and to have less itch. So a lot of times I'm asked by other colleagues, why do you give antidepressant? Why do you give anticonvulsants like Gabapentin, Pregabalin, and I say, I give them because it really reduces the itch intensity and the suffering. So there is a lot of similarities here with chronic pain. GROSS: Since chronic pain and chronic itch are similar but different, are people who are prone to chronic pain also prone to chronic itch and vice versa? YOSIPOVITCH: There's not really an epidemiology study to suggest that, but I would say, from my experience, there are a lot of overlaps of people who have some types of chronic pain and they're in the same spectrum of chronic itch, and they could have chronic itch. This is not well mentioned, but for patients who have, for example, fibromyalgia, if it causes chronic pain, a lot of times they complain also of chronic itch. So it won't surprise me, people who have irritable bowel syndrome, which is another form of - all these aspects of disease have something in common - they have a hypersensitization of the nerve fibers and it's very similar to what I described before, with a patient with chronic itch is that the nerves are acting wacky; they're just firing all over. And that's why it's so severe and why it's so difficult to treat these patients. GROSS: You know, some people who have chronic pain syndromes say that their doctors are very dismissive. And you mentioned fibromyalgia; a lot of doctors don't even consider that a serious diagnosis. Does the same happen with chronic itch? Do you find that a lot of patients who come to you have been dismissed as having either imagined complaints, or neurotic complaints or exaggerated complaints? YOSIPOVITCH: I agree with you and I think, we in our profession as dermatologists like to see a lot of times, skin signs, rashes. And when a patient tells you that he has itch, that he cannot sleep and - I use, a lot of times, a intensity scale, what we call a visual analog scale and ask him, rate your itch. And I think, for us as dermatologists, it's sometimes very difficult to, if we don't see the scratch marks but the patient tells you, I suffer from horrible itch, it sometimes causes us to think that maybe he's exaggerating. But from my experiences, it's not what you see, it's what the patient complains of. I therefore believe strongly that we need to address itch as a disease - chronic itch as a disease - on its own state and understand our patients' suffering. GROSS: Now, you're a dermatologist, but a lot of itches you deal with aren't really about the skin - it's not a skin condition, it's not hives, it's not a bite, it's not a rash - it's something that's happening neurologically and you're trying to figure out, what is it that's happening neurologically? But again, it's not a skin issue, per se. YOSIPOVITCH: Well, I see it in the perspective of the skin. The skin is a sensory organ and has all the nerves. And the patients come because they think that the dermatologists have to solve it. And it's interesting - I don't want to be critical of my colleagues in neurology but - very few of neurologists are interested in some of those sensations. I would say that, I think one of the purposes of putting itch as a focus of my work is to raise awareness among other specialties, that they have to address this topic, including my colleagues in neurology, including other experts, even pain experts; that they have to understand that sometimes patients have both pain and itch, like, post Shingles. And they sometimes would dismiss the patient - say, oh, well if you have itch, I'm not bothered with it; we just want to deal with pain. But, I see that as part of the same spectrum. GROSS: Dr. Yosipovitch, thank you so much for talking with us. I appreciate it. YOSIPOVITCH: My pleasure.

I'm Scott Simon. Later this month, scientists are gathering in Stockholm for World Water Week. That doesn't mean belly flop contest or waterslides. Instead, scientists will examine key issues facing the world's water supplies. Earlier this Summer, marine scientists across the globe took part in the first of its kind synchronized research project called Ocean Sampling Day. Georgia Public Broadcasting Sarah McCammon reports. SARACH MCCAMMON, BYLINE: On a muggy Summer afternoon along the Georgia coast, Kevin McKenzie squats on a wooden dock, lowering a collection bottle exactly one meter into the water. KEVIN MCKENZIE: Try not to splash it too much. MCCAMMON: He hoisted back up and pours the water into a large container. MCKENZIE: Today, we are collecting 60 liters. MCCAMMON: McKenzie is with the University of Georgia's Skidaway Institute of Oceanography here in Savannah. He's among the marine scientists from Iceland to Indonesia who collected ocean microbes on one particular day, June 21 - the summer solstice. MCKENZIE: You have to study microbes. They have to be studied. MCCAMMON: At the Skidaway lab, research technician Tina Walters explains the importance of microbes like bacteria, viruses and fungi. Some microbes form the basis of a food chain. Others help purify the ocean by breaking down pollutants like oil spills. MCKENZIE: We're just running the water through the filter and whatever's collecting on the filter will be set off for sequencing. MCCAMMON: DNA sequencing - research can do it faster and more cheaply than ever before. And that's making large-scale projects, like Ocean Sampling Day, possible. Frank Glockner is leading the project which is funded by the European Union. He's a marine researcher at Jacobs University in Bremen, Germany. Speaking via Skype, he says he hoped that 20 or 30 research stations might participate. FRANK GLOCKNER: More and more stations came in, and we ended up with 185. So this was totally unexpected, to be honest. MCCAMMON: Glockner says the point of bringing together researchers from around the world on a single day is to eliminate one big variable in ocean research - time. GLOCKNER: It is now time that we have a snapshot of a single day - going out on the same day, taking samples under standardized protocol. EILEEN BRESNAN: That's a tremendous advantage because the variation in individual labs doing this by themselves sometimes make comparisons more difficult. MCCAMMON: That's Eileen Bresnan with Marine Scotland Science, a government research institute on Scotland's northeast coast. She says she's not aware of another synchronized effort like this. Brenan says samples taken on a single day are valuable because marine microbes have short life cycles. You might find lots of one particular kind of microbe on a given day, but. . . BRESNAN: It might not be there when you come back a week later or a different species could be dominating. MCCAMMON: Some scientists caution there are limits to this worldwide sampling. John Paul is a marine scientist at the University of South Florida, and he's not part of the project. Paul says one day of sampling is a tiny drop in a very large bucket. But he acknowledges the benefits of casting such a wide net. JOHN PAUL: Well, I'm sure something unusual is going to be found. I mean, there may be a discovery that clearly was not intended or fortuitous. MCCAMMON: And to increase the chance of finding something fortuitous, organizers say they hope to plan a more ocean sampling days. They'll make the initial results public early next year.

But centuries earlier, it was Leonardo da Vinci who imagined human flight. He recognized how birds use lift and wing shape to glide and sketched out how humans might do that too. Well, today, we have the story of someone you could call the da Vinci of modern brain science. NPR's Chris Benderev tells us more about him. CHRIS BENDEREV, BYLINE: The da Vinci of brain science was, appropriately enough, also Italian. His name was Angelo Mosso. He lived in the 1800s. And until several years ago, his manuscripts were collecting a hefty layer of dust in the archives of an Italian University. Then someone opened them up and found sketches from 1882 of the first ever machine designed to watch the brain at work. It didn't look anything like a modern brain scanner. DAVID FIELD: Looks like some kind of medieval torture device. (Laughing) I mean it's got a big strap - just kind of stopped the person moving around too much. BENDEREV: This is David Field. He's a psychologist at the University of Reading. He's looked closely at those sketches of Angelo Mosso's machine which was called the human circulation balance. The whole thing was based on a simple idea. Your brain needs more blood when it works harder. FIELD: He reasoned that he ought to be able to measure any net change in the volume of blood in the brain using what is essentially a lever. BENDEREV: Here's what Mosso did. He invited people to lie down this long wooden plank which he'd carefully balanced on a fulcrum, kind of like a seesaw. Then he calibrated for anything that might throw off the balance, like the rise and fall of that person's breathing. Finally, with everything set, he'd ring a bell. Mosso figured his volunteer's brain would have to process that sound, requiring more blood, making it weigh more, which would tip the scale towards the head side. And, at least according to his manuscripts, that's exactly what happened. Stefano Sandrone, a neuroscientist at King's College London, is the man who uncovered those manuscripts, and he may just be the world's biggest Angelo Mosso fan. STEFANO SANDRONE: It's like a romantic story, like a dream came true trying to weigh the thoughts. BENDEREV: Mosso was trying to weigh thoughts, and Sandrone says, Mosso also figured the bigger the thought, the more it would weigh. So he'd have his volunteer read something light, like a newspaper. And Sandrone says, the balance would tilt a little bit. SANDRONE: And then the more difficult the task became, such as reading a mathematical book or reading a philosophy book, the more the balance tilted toward the head side. BENDEREV: That's what Mosso's documents claim. It's not exactly clear how well the balance worked. But Sandrone says, like da Vinci, Mosso had hit upon the right idea. SANDRONE: Because it's the first proof that there is a relationship between our cognitive activities and our brain blood flow. BENDEREV: But Russ Poldrack of UT Austin says pretty soon people starting putting too much faith in the human circulation balance. RUSS POLDRACK: Claims were being made at the point about how, you know, this balance was going to help us understand everything we need to know about the brain. BENDEREV: Poldrack is an expert on modern-day brain scanning technology. He says at the turn of the last century, people had unrealistic expectations for Mosso's invention, just like they sometimes have for today's brain scanners. Take, for instance, functional magnetic resonance imaging - fMRI - it's basically Mosso's dream come true. It tells us what parts of the brain are working harder by tracking where the blood goes. And Poldrack says, to be sure, fMRI is an incredible tool. But consider how it was misused a few years back by a branding consultant. POLDRACK: He had put people in the scanner and shown them iPhones and claimed that he saw activity in an area of their brain that demonstrated that people were in love with their iPhones. BENDEREV: The problem - that part of the brain is also associated with pain and disgust and other emotions. The brain, it turns out, is just not that simple. But Poldrack has a guess as to why brain technology has often made it seem simple. POLDRACK: We're sort of fascinated by seeing thought which seems so nonmaterial - seeing it as a material thing. And I think people often feel like if they see it on an imaging scan, it's real in a way that it isn't real if it's just being talked about. BENDEREV: In the end, says Poldrack, Mosso's balance, the fMRI - they're both machines with limitations. Chris Benderev, NPR News.

RUSS POLDRACK: Claims were being made at the point about how, you know, this balance was going to help us understand everything we need to know about the brain. BENDEREV: Poldrack is an expert on modern-day brain scanning technology. He says at the turn of the last century, people had unrealistic expectations for Mosso's invention, just like they sometimes have for today's brain scanners. Take, for instance, functional magnetic resonance imaging - fMRI - it's basically Mosso's dream come true. It tells us what parts of the brain are working harder by tracking where the blood goes. And Poldrack says, to be sure, fMRI is an incredible tool. But consider how it was misused a few years back by a branding consultant. POLDRACK: He had put people in the scanner and shown them iPhones and claimed that he saw activity in an area of their brain that demonstrated that people were in love with their iPhones. BENDEREV: The problem - that part of the brain is also associated with pain and disgust and other emotions. The brain, it turns out, is just not that simple. But Poldrack has a guess as to why brain technology has often made it seem simple. POLDRACK: We're sort of fascinated by seeing thought which seems so nonmaterial - seeing it as a material thing. And I think people often feel like if they see it on an imaging scan, it's real in a way that it isn't real if it's just being talked about. BENDEREV: In the end, says Poldrack, Mosso's balance, the fMRI - they're both machines with limitations. Chris Benderev, NPR News.", "section": "Science", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2014 NPR.

Illegal trade of ivory from African elephants has tripled in the past 15 years. Most of it is sold in China and Vietnam. And the U. S. government is urging those countries to arrest the traffickers. But for the better part of a century, the United States was the world's biggest ivory consumer. Hundreds of thousands of elephants were killed and uncounted numbers of Africans were enslaved to carry tusks to ships bound for America. Most of that ivory actually went to a tiny town in Connecticut. NPR's Christopher Joyce visited that town, which is now dealing with this dark part of its past. (SOUNDBITE OF FIFE AND DRUM CORPS PLAYING)CHRISTOPHER JOYCE, BYLINE: Deep River takes its history seriously. Driving into town, I pass a fife and drum corps practicing for a performance on the village green. I pass centuries-old mills and newly painted Victorian mansions. A hundred and fifty years ago, people called this town the Queen of the Valley. The town was prosperous. But ivory made Deep River rich. MARTA DANIELS: I have always thought of this road as the road of tears. JOYCE: I'm driving with Marta Daniels. She's a writer by trade and historian by avocation. The road we're on connects a landing on the Connecticut River to the town. DANIELS: Between 1840 and 1940 via this road was the greatest importer of ivory in the world. JOYCE: Along this road came the wagons of Pratt, Read and Company. They loaded elephant tusks from ships and took them up to a huge brick factory. That factory, longer than a city block, is still here. It's now a condominium called Piano Works. (SOUNDBITE OF WATER RUNNING)JOYCE: Water still cascades through a nearby sluice that ran the factory's machines. Jeff Hostetler, president of the Deep River Historical Society, says it was one machine in particular that brought ivory here. JEFF HOSTETLER: What happened is Phineas Pratt, a very good mechanic and inventor, developed an ivory lathe to cut the teeth in ivory combs. And of course all of Phineas' relatives bought one of Phineas' machines and went into the comb business. JOYCE: And then into billiard balls, cutlery handles, shirt buttons - all manner of knick-knacks. But then came the piano. In the mid-1800s, a piano in the parlor became a symbol of middle-class cultivation. Pratt's amazing cutting lathes were turned to making ivory piano keys. Piano keys required extra labor though. So soon the business sprawled all over town. HOSTETLER: Pianists liked white. So the way to get a good uniform white color is to take these thin wafers of ivory and just bleach them in the sun. JOYCE: Acres of bleaching houses sprang up - huge greenhouse with blocks of ivory instead of plants in them. People fertilized gardens with ivory dust. Kids swimming in local ponds came out coated in it. Soon a rival company, Comstock, Cheney and Company, emerged. They built a whole new town nearby called Ivoryton. The two towns dominated the piano key business for decades. Fortunes were made and spent on grand houses that still stand. (SOUNDBITE OF DOOR OPENING)JOYCE: One of them is now headquarters of the historical society and home to a startling assortment of artifacts that made Deep River rich. Curator Rhonda Forristall shows me around. RHONDA FORRISTALL: You've got needles. You've got crochet hooks, toothpicks, buttonhooks again. JOYCE: Beads, necklaces. FORRISTALL: Yeah, razors. (SOUNDBITE OF OUT-OF-TUNE PIANO)JOYCE: And of course pianos made with ivory keys, a practice that didn't end until the 1950s as cheaper plastic replaced ivory. In Deep River, these artifacts are a source of civic pride but one that's also tinged with shame especially as the world condemns the current slaughter of elephants to make trinkets. Marta Daniels, for one, says if Americans are going to condemn others for trading in ivory, they should at least know their own history. DANIELS: We were the largest importer of tusks anywhere in the world. So we have a special responsibility. And we have a unique opportunity to say we are sorry that we have done this but we want in some way to help stop the slaughter now. JOYCE: Citizens have formed the Deep River Tusk Force to publicize the ivory history here. They organized a conference with speakers from the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service to talk about the U. S. ivory trade. They speak in schools and they're lobbying for a law banning the import of existing ivory into the state. They raised money to buy an elephant statue that sits in front of town hall. Those efforts aren't likely to resonate in China and Vietnam. But Peter Howard, trustee of the historical society, says at least Deep River residents are now confronting the town's past. PETER HOWARD: There's a lot of debt that's owed the elephant here and a lot of awareness. But it was kind of in the back of people's minds. And maybe we should be beginning to think about making people aware of what happened here. JOYCE: And it happened long ago. Deep River's John Guy LaPlante says attitudes were different then. JOHN GUY LAPLANTE: You know, we deplore what happened to the elephant. It was brutal. There's no doubt about it. But we have to put it in context. These men - these men, who ran this industry, were upstanding, moral, high-minded people who didn't think they were doing anything wrong. JOYCE: But there was another ugly fact about this trade that many didn't know about or didn't want to know about - ivory slavery. Ivory traders needed ivory bearers. So they captured Africans and enslaved them to transport the tusks. Richard Conniff investigated the African end of the trade. He's a writer who bought a house in Deep River and then discovered its past. He found historical accounts from Africa and from Deep River's ivory barons. They tell of ships from Connecticut that sailed to Zanzibar, an island off the east coast of Africa. Americans arrived with cloth, gunpowder and weapons to trade. The ivory came from central Africa brought to Zanzibar by Arab slavers. RICHARD CONNIFF: They would seize slave, seize ivory and then use the slaves to carry the ivory back to the cost. And the descriptions that missionaries gave of those caravans were particularly brutal - so slaves bound by a log basically around the neck to the person behind them and then carrying a tusk on one shoulder. JOYCE: Often, only one in four slaves survived the journey, according to British explorer David Livingstone. One of the buyers in Zanzibar was Ernst Moore, who worked for Deep River's Pratt, Read and Company. Moore wrote a book called \"Ivory: Scourge of Africa. \" He grew to hate the ivory trade and the slavery that maintained it. But Conniff says -CONNIFF: He is the one who also said our lives were so crammed with our business and adventure that we were perfectly content to take what we had and make the best of it. JOYCE: And Conniff says that's likely the attitude of people who are buying illegal ivory now. CONNIFF: What they need to realize is what this town has discovered - that our involvement in that kind of thing is ultimately a source of shame and that the grandchildren of those people who are buying the ivory are going to look at them with the kind of horror with which we now regard the ivory trade that happened here.

Arun Rath is away. I'm Tess Vigeland. School is starting. That means lots of time in the classroom or library sitting quietly - no distractions. But more and more brain science is saying that may not be the best way to learn. Benedict Carey covers medicine and science for the New York Times, and he's written a new book called \"How We Learn. \" Ben, welcome. BENEDICT CAREY: Thanks very much. Nice to be here. VIGELAND: And I'm going to play a game on my phone and look up tips on how to juggle and maybe take a nap while I'm talking to you. How does that sound? CAREY: That sounds good. Absolutely. VIGELAND: 'Cause then I'm going to remember and absorb more of this conversation, right? CAREY: Yes, you are. Well, look, I mean, a lot of people think learning is all discipline. I know I believed it. And it turns out that scientists have discovered - through a whole lot of different ways - that it doesn't work that way. The brain is a foraging instrument. You know, it's a scavenger just like humans were for so much of their existence. And once you appreciate that, you're able to take some pressure off yourself to not worry that you're doing things right all the time and to have a tactical plan when you study for something. VIGELAND: Right. Well, you talked about how - I mean, I think most of us grew up with this notion that self-discipline and focus are what we really need to learn something. And apparently that needs to be replaced by distractions and, maybe even as I noted, napping. So what is it about our brains that we know now that basically turns the whole concept of learning - shall we say - on its head? CAREY: Well, we know that quiet study, ritual - all those things we assumed to be true - assumed to be self-evident - those are only one way to study. A lot of the things we've learned, whether it's to cook or ride a bicycle, to socialize, we've done those piecemeal. The brain is very good at learning on-the-fly during daily life. And so to take topics and isolate them, you know, to sit there like a monk with a textbook - with the chemistry textbook - I mean, who wants to do that, right? It's difficult. I'm not saying it's - you throw it away. I'm saying that's only one environment where learning occurs. It also occurs throughout your daily life. VIGELAND: So a lot of this deals with memory - memorization. But of course, memorization doesn't necessarily translate into comprehension. So, like, you can know all the U. S. President's names and when they were in office, but that doesn't mean you understand history, right? CAREY: That's right. VIGELAND: So does this new way of learning address that as well? CAREY: It does. There are a bunch of things that scientists now know improve retention, which is talking about, you know, foreign-language, names, places, facts and figures and so on. And there are a handful of things, also, that seem to aide comprehension. For example, distraction - distraction is one of those things everybody's worried about - certainly every parent, you know, with the iPhones and people jumping on Facebook and so on. VIGELAND: Right. CAREY: And, you know, of course if you're spending your entire time tooling around on Facebook, you're not studying. So that's a problem. However, there's a whole bunch of science looking at problem solving. In problem solving, when you get stuck, you've run out of ideas. Distraction is really your best friend. You need to stand up, let it go, walk around the block, go to the cafe, drink a beer - whatever it is. And that is really your best shot at loosening the gears a little bit and allowing yourself to take a different and more creative approach to the problem. VIGELAND: You know, I wonder what some of these new findings mean to the current debate in education over things like Common Core and, you know, the idea of teaching to the test. Do you think these findings about how we learn could or should change how we evaluate what we learn? CAREY: These are - the science addresses how you learn, how I learn, how an individual learns. And they are independent of any policy changes. Now when it comes to standardized testing, there is a story to tell. There is a lot of interesting research now looking at using testing as a study tool, and that self-examination or even doing tests before a course starts are both very intriguing, interesting and possibly sort of revolutionary approaches to learning. VIGELAND: What are some practical ways, then, that we can take some of this new data and apply it to our own learning methods like, say - so I want to learn Spanish - which I actually do - or I want to get better at photography - which I do. What's your advice for me? CAREY: Well, one of the easiest things you can do - well, take Spanish first but simply move around. You don't need to stay in the same place. You don't have to have the same chair, the same cubicle, the same room to do your memorization. Changing context, changing environment aids in retention and, in this case, particularly in learning Spanish words. Now photography - that's a different thing altogether. It's very creative. There, I tend to think of that more in the sense of what I call in the book percolation, which is an interesting thing that I think all adults who have learned something know happens. You know, you're starting a very big project. You don't even really know where to start. And the science on this says, just start the thing. You can quit five minutes later or ten minutes later because what happens when you do that is it activates your mind to begin sort of scavenging the environment and your own thoughts for what the relevant information is in your life. VIGELAND: All right. Well, I'm going to go back to the cake that I'm baking and the math problem in my checking account and see if I remember any of this conversation. How's that? (Laughter).

Earthquake, Shake Alert Tests Its Legs : NPR", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2014/08/25/343203813/in-latest-calif-earthquake-shake-alert-tests-its-legs", "author": "No author found", "published_date": "2014-08-25", "content": "MELISSA BLOCK, HOST: Early Sunday morning, seconds before the ground started shaking in Northern California, an early warning system sent out an alert. First, a series of loud horn sounds, then a voice saying earthquake, earthquake, light shaking expected in three seconds - or it could be five seconds, maybe 10 or even a minute. That warning system called ShakeAlert is still in its early stages. Warnings like that one go out to just a handful of test users, including BART, the Bay area's rapid transit system, also the LA County Fire Department and Disneyland, among others. Geophysicist Doug Given is one of the scientists spearheading the project. He's the National Earthquake Early Warning coordinator for the U. S. Geological Survey. DOUG GIVEN: Earthquake early warning is not earthquake prediction. It's just very rapid determination of the earthquake once it has begun. There are very sophisticated scientific algorithms to determine where the earthquake is and how big it is in less than a second, which is actually quite remarkable given that the earthquake has just begun and really hasn't fully developed. BLOCK: And when you think forward imagining if you would want this disseminated broadly to everybody, how would people be getting this warning? GIVEN: When we go public with the ShakeAlert system, you can expect to see it on your television, on radio, on your smartphone, possibly in dedicated systems within buildings or shopping malls. If you've ever gotten an AMBER Alert, that same system will be used to distribute earthquake early warning information to the public at large. BLOCK: And if you're getting an early warning that says basically severe shaking coming in three seconds, how do you expect people to use that information in a way that makes them safer? GIVEN: Well, we're going to have to do a lot of education and training to make sure the public understands the system and knows how to respond to it. But in just a few seconds, you can do what we've been telling you to do all along, and that's drop, cover and hold on. Often people just sort of look around, they don't know exactly what to do, or they feel embarrassed about getting under a table, particularly if they're, you know, with another group of people. So this would actually have the advantage of knowing for sure that this is going to be a big earthquake and perhaps your cellphone app will say, yeah, we're serious, this is it, really, get under your table now. BLOCK: But beyond individual actions that I might take or you might take, you're also thinking about automated systems, big infrastructure systems. What kinds of things would this allow you to do or allow them to do? GIVEN: So, for example, today, the Bay Area Rapid Transit System, their Metro system, is wired into the system so that it will slow down and stop trains and prevent derailments. That was in fact one of the major reasons that early warning was devised in Japan - was to protect their bullet trains. Other systems like elevators would stop at the next floor and open the doors. Factory floors, refineries, pipelines, any automatic systems could be wired into the early warning system. BLOCK: How far away would you say we are from having a system as extensive and robust and wired in as you would want to see? GIVEN: Well, it's the goal of the USGS to build an earthquake early warning system for the West Coast - Washington, Oregon and California. And we're making positive steps in that direction, but we've got very limited resources to do it. BLOCK: And the price tag would be what? GIVEN: Well, we've got the estimate for a West Coast system, to actually build it out, at about $38 million for infrastructure improvements and telemetry and computer systems and testing and all that sort of thing. And then we estimate that it would be about $16 million a year to operate it every year. BLOCK: OK. Doug Given, thanks so much. GIVEN: All right, thank you. BLOCK: Doug Given is the Earthquake Early Warning coordinator with the U. S. Geological Survey in Pasadena. MELISSA BLOCK, HOST:  Early Sunday morning, seconds before the ground started shaking in Northern California, an early warning system sent out an alert. First, a series of loud horn sounds, then a voice saying earthquake, earthquake, light shaking expected in three seconds - or it could be five seconds, maybe 10 or even a minute. That warning system called ShakeAlert is still in its early stages. Warnings like that one go out to just a handful of test users, including BART, the Bay area's rapid transit system, also the LA County Fire Department and Disneyland, among others. Geophysicist Doug Given is one of the scientists spearheading the project. He's the National Earthquake Early Warning coordinator for the U. S. Geological Survey. DOUG GIVEN: Earthquake early warning is not earthquake prediction. It's just very rapid determination of the earthquake once it has begun. There are very sophisticated scientific algorithms to determine where the earthquake is and how big it is in less than a second, which is actually quite remarkable given that the earthquake has just begun and really hasn't fully developed. BLOCK: And when you think forward imagining if you would want this disseminated broadly to everybody, how would people be getting this warning? GIVEN: When we go public with the ShakeAlert system, you can expect to see it on your television, on radio, on your smartphone, possibly in dedicated systems within buildings or shopping malls. If you've ever gotten an AMBER Alert, that same system will be used to distribute earthquake early warning information to the public at large. BLOCK: And if you're getting an early warning that says basically severe shaking coming in three seconds, how do you expect people to use that information in a way that makes them safer?

Among its jewels are glaciers and snow fields that irrigate part of North America during the spring thaw. But the region is getting warmer, even faster than the rest of the world. NPR's Christopher Joyce recently visited scientists in Montana who say warming is scrambling the complex relationship between water and wildlife. It's threatening some with extinction. CHRISTOPHER JOYCE, BYLINE: I'm flying over northern Montana's mountains in a Cessna two-seater with ecologist Richard Hauer. Snowcapped mountains and wide valleys are spread out below. Hauer calls this place a giant sponge. Moist air from the Pacific hits the mountains and falls as snow and ice. It sits in the mountains until spring when it melts and runs through the gravel valleys and across big parts of North America. It's worked that way for millennia. But lately, Hauer says, Montana is warmer, and the spring melt starts earlier and flashes through this sponge much faster. RICHARD HAUER: There's change that takes place because the snowmelt is occurring earlier. And, basically, if you turn the spigot on earlier, it runs out of water sooner. JOYCE: Running out of water sooner means drier summers, just when plants and animals and people need it most. Ecologists like Hauer, who's at the University of Montana, say there are other changes as well - retreating glaciers and more flash floods. Scientists are studying how all this affects wildlife - wildlife that's important for holding together the whole ecosystem here. I joined three ecologists from the U. S. Geological Survey on a mountainside a couple of thousand feet below Hauer's flight path. We're hiking up into a snowfield in Glacier National Park, toward a stream flowing down from the snow. JOE GIERSCH: Great place to be if you're an obscure, high alpine stream insect. JOYCE: Obscure insects are Joe Giersch's life. Several species of rare, but important, insects live here in 40-degree meltwater. Giersch bends over the stream - it's only a few inches deep - and turns over a few rocks. In 10 minutes, he finds what he wants - a tiny, brown, wet smudge of a fly. GIERSCH: All right. This is lednia tumana. JOYCE: Now, come on, you can really tell the species? GIERSCH: Yeah. Oh yeah, I've looked at a lot of these. JOYCE: I mean, that's smaller than a match head. GIERSCH: Yeah, exactly. It's charismatic microfauna. JOYCE: Charismatic may be a stretch, but micro for sure. Lednia tumana is a stone fly. It spends part of its life in streams, but only icy streams in these mountains. The fly eats algae and other tiny organisms in the streams, and other insects and birds eat them. They're part of a larger food web. Pull out one string, says ecologist Daniel Fagre, and the web starts to come apart. DANIEL FAGRE: In only a few decades, we're going to lose all the glaciers here. And they've been persistent on this landscape for at least 7,000 years. So suddenly, you're having a profound change in just a few decades. And that's very difficult for many organisms to adapt to. JOYCE: What's happening is that as average temperature increases here, the snow and ice retreat up the mountain to colder air. Fagre's colleague Clint Muhlfeld says, eventually, the ice and the insects will run out of mountain. CLINT MUHLFELD: You know, there's nowhere to go. They're at the top of the continent - the water tower of the continent, and it's squeeze play. JOYCE: Moving farther down the mountain, you can see more signs of this disruption in the way water works here. In and around Montana's Flathead Lake, for example - one of the biggest lakes in the country -  Jack Stanford runs the Flathead Lake Biological Station. He spent decades studying the complex interactions of plants, animals and water. JACK STANFORD: The way in which water is deposited first and then transported by the rivers is fundamental to the distribution and abundance of organisms. JOYCE: Organisms that are important not only to nature but to people, too. Take salmon. Salmon lay eggs in the gravel of streambeds. But if you get a warmer spring, you get flash floods. That's because the rain comes in before the snow has melted. It's called a rain-on-snow event. It's like rain falling on pavement. It creates floods that wash the young salmon away and decimates the population. STANFORD: The way it plays out is that the food web gets a shakeup. The bottom line is that some players in that complex food web will be winners and some will be losers. JOYCE: Stanford says humans have already altered the natural world in unpredictable ways. Climate change is like putting another pair of dice in play. Christopher Joyce, NPR News. ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:  The Northern arm of the Rocky Mountains is sometimes called the crown of the continent.

You're watching an action movie - let's say \"Iron Man 2. \"(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"IRON MAN 2\")SIEGEL: There's a racecar flying through the air, its tires are off and bouncing free, crowds of fans are taking all this in. It's the Monaco Grand Prix, and the onlookers are on grandstands and balconies of seaside condos. What do you actually see? Where do you look? Well, Tim Smith set out to answer that question scientifically. He's a vision scientist at Birkbeck University of London and he took part in a recent conference organized by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. He joins us from London. Welcome to the program. TIM SMITH: Hi. Thank you, Robert. SIEGEL: And first tell us - how did you set about answering those very questions? SMITH: Well, it's a tricky question because when we see the world, we have the impression that we take in a lot of information. But I know as a vision scientist that actually, our impression of the world is very limited. It's limited to what lands directly at the center of our eyes. And so a way to record people's impressions of a scene is to use of a device called an eye-tracker, which is a high-speed camera system which can monitor where your eyes are pointing in any particular scene. And also which part of the scene it isn't focused on. And that gives us an idea of which bits are likely to make it into their awareness and make it into their long-term memory. SIEGEL: So you had a sample audience - about how big? SMITH: About 75 people. SIEGEL: And the result of this was kind of a heat map showing what all of these eyeballs had been focused on, superimposed on the actual scene from \"Iron Man 2. \" And you discussed this with, among others, Jon Favreau, who directed the movie. I mean, did you discover anything different from what Jon Favreau had seen in his own movie? SMITH: It was really nice because we did it as a live experiment, which is always very risky because it could have gone disastrously wrong on the night. And I asked him to describe the sequence before. And he told me some details about the production which I was completely unaware of, which is that actual scene was filmed on a parking lot in America. He'd never been to Monaco and probably about 70 percent of the image was CG, or post-effects. So a lot of it had been made up artificially. And some of the decisions he'd made, such as how detailed to render the audience in the background, were based on his assumption about where the viewers would look because he thought that any particular moment, the audience were looking at the main characters, at their faces, at the explosions or the action which is at the center of the frame. SIEGEL: And your experiment pretty much vindicated that, didn't it? SMITH: Absolutely. So when I showed it to Jon, he was really surprised because he's sitting with two hats on - both as the director but also as a producer - thinking, I'm going to spend less budget on the special effects in the background because people aren't going to notice. And the heat map exactly vindicates that because it shows that, you get this effect called attentional synchrony, when most of the viewers are looking in the same place at the same time and if you have less detail in the periphery, they're not going to be able to attend to it. So they're not going to see it, at least on the first viewing. SIEGEL: So this is a strong argument for not going to Monaco to shoot anything there; its expensive. You can do computer graphics around the periphery and nobody will notice the difference. SMITH: Yeah, at least on the first viewing of a scene. It depends on what you're trying to show and who your audiences are. For instance, I've talked to a few animators; the likes of DreamWorks and Pixar and they invest a lot of time and money in details like costumes and backgrounds because they know that their audiences are going to watch their films over and over again. And the more you watch a film, the more likely you are to look at all the parts of the image. SIEGEL: Now, I have had one viewing experience that runs counter to what you found. And that is watching baseball games on high definition, as opposed to standard definition television. One big difference for me - and I love watching baseball games - is that on high definition, I actually see the faces of the fans who are sitting behind home plate, many rows deep - they're real people to me. And somehow, it's a more realistic and fun experience, I find, to see that, even though I could follow the action just as well at standard resolution. SMITH: Yeah. We're in an interesting technological era right now and it's one of the reasons why the Academy of Motion Pictures wanted to hold this event about the neuroscience and the psychology of film because they realized that there are so many technological options like high-def, standard-def, high frame rate, 3-D, CG, that they need to understand what's the impact on the viewer's experience. And exactly what you described is something which comes about by just making a simple decision - do I use a high-def camera, or do I use a standard-definition camera? But, you could look at more details; you could see it in a different way. And so these are things we need to really understand, by understanding how the visual and auditory brain works and how the audiences are going to respond to those films and TV clips.

Veronique LaCapra of St. Louis Public Radio mustered up her courage and went out to the cemetery at night. VERONIQUE LACAPRA, BYLINE: I had visited St. Louis's Bellefontaine Cemetery before, but never at night. It is dark. There's just about a half a moon visible in the sky and - wait a minute. What's that over there? I can see eerie lights and strange, shadowy figures moving among the grave stones. (SOUNDBITE OF UNIDENTIFIED FILM)UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As character) Look. There comes one of them now. VONA KUCZYNSKA: Hi, my name is Vona Kuczynska, and I'm a wildlife biologist. And I'm a student at the University of Missouri St. Louis. LACAPRA: OK. Those mysterious lights? - headlamps. And the ghosts or zombies? - just researchers. They're part of an effort to try to get an idea of the range of wildlife that's in the cemetery. Scientists have already studied birds here. Tonight, some people are looking at moths. Kuczynska is focusing on bats. KUCZYNSKA: When you're holding a bat in your hand, you just see how beautiful they are. And they have so much personality. LACAPRA: What do you mean? Wait, wait, wait, wait. So bats have personalities? KUCZYNSKA: Bats absolutely have personalities. LACAPRA: Some species, she tells me, are really gentle and don't seem to mind being handled. KUCZYNSKA: Whereas other bats - usually bigger bats - are way more aggressive. And they'll try to bite you and escape and do all these things. LACAPRA: Kuczynska's in the cemetery trying to find out what kinds of bats are flying around here. (SOUNDBITE OF BAT CHIRPING)LACAPRA: That's a big brown bat complaining about getting snagged in one of the nets Kuczynska and her helpers set up before sunset. They look something like oversized volleyball nets, only with much finer mesh. But very few bats actually get caught in them. That's because bats use a kind of biological sonar called echolocation to avoid obstacles and find their insect prey, even in the dark. So Kuczynska is also using a special bat detector. (SOUNDBITE OF ANABAT CLICKING)LACAPRA: To show me how it works, she carries the big brown bat toward a small device that's lying on the ground. It's about the size and shape of a paperback book. It's called an AnaBat. (SOUNDBITE OF ANABAT CLICKING)KUCZYNSKA: And so the AnaBat is recording these noises and playing them back to us in a range that we can hear. And it allows us to see if there's activity - bat activity - in the area. LACAPRA: Now, it turns out that cemeteries aren't just great places for spooky things like bats. SETH MAGLE: I mean, I suspect that most of the species that are found in cities are probably also using cemeteries. LACAPRA: Seth Magle, who directs the Urban Wildlife Institute in Chicago, says with increasing urbanization, it's critical that animals have places in cities where they can live. He says like parks, golf courses and other urban green spaces, cemeteries can also provide an essential refuge for all sorts of wildlife. MAGLE: Coyotes, red foxes, skunks, woodchucks, opossum, whitetail deer, beaver. . . LACAPRA: Along with more common city residents, like birds and squirrels. It's easy to see why animals would be drawn to a cemetery like Bellefontaine. It's more of a majestic, 19th century park, with thousands of big trees spread out over more than 300 acres. But Magle says some animals can forge even in a place that's just gravestones and grass. MAGLE: Species like coyotes are not terribly selective about that kind of stuff. It seems like mostly what they're looking for in these urban areas are rabbits. And rabbits like grass, so the rabbits will come in for the grass and then the coyotes may come in for the rabbits. LACAPRA: The idea of cemeteries as wildlife habitat may seem kind of strange here in America, where most cemeteries are kept pretty manicured. But over in England, where, like in the U. S. , urban development and industrial agriculture have reduced wildlife habitat, it's common practice to let at least the older parts of cemeteries go back to a more natural state. MANDY ELFORD: Nobody wants to go to an overgrown grave for a loved one. But we can have little nesting places here and there. LACAPRA: Mandy Elford works as an ecologist for the city of Manchester, which is actively trying to make it's cemeteries more wildlife friendly. How do you think the dead would feel about having all this wildlife running around their graves? ELFORD: I don't think they'll mind one little bit. (Laughter). LACAPRA: Personally, Elford says, she'd be very happy about it. For NPR News, I'm Veronique LaCapra. MELISSA BLOCK, HOST: You're listening to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:  We're going to spend a little time now in a cemetery in the interest of science. Veronique LaCapra of St. Louis Public Radio mustered up her courage and went out to the cemetery at night. VERONIQUE LACAPRA, BYLINE: I had visited St. Louis's Bellefontaine Cemetery before, but never at night. It is dark. There's just about a half a moon visible in the sky and - wait a minute. What's that over there? I can see eerie lights and strange, shadowy figures moving among the grave stones. (SOUNDBITE OF UNIDENTIFIED FILM) UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As character) Look. There comes one of them now. VONA KUCZYNSKA: Hi, my name is Vona Kuczynska, and I'm a wildlife biologist. And I'm a student at the University of Missouri St. Louis. LACAPRA: OK. Those mysterious lights? - headlamps. And the ghosts or zombies? - just researchers. They're part of an effort to try to get an idea of the range of wildlife that's in the cemetery. Scientists have already studied birds here. Tonight, some people are looking at moths. Kuczynska is focusing on bats. KUCZYNSKA: When you're holding a bat in your hand, you just see how beautiful they are. And they have so much personality. LACAPRA: What do you mean? Wait, wait, wait, wait. So bats have personalities? KUCZYNSKA: Bats absolutely have personalities. LACAPRA: Some species, she tells me, are really gentle and don't seem to mind being handled. KUCZYNSKA: Whereas other bats - usually bigger bats - are way more aggressive. And they'll try to bite you and escape and do all these things. LACAPRA: Kuczynska's in the cemetery trying to find out what kinds of bats are flying around here. (SOUNDBITE OF BAT CHIRPING) LACAPRA: That's a big brown bat complaining about getting snagged in one of the nets Kuczynska and her helpers set up before sunset. They look something like oversized volleyball nets, only with much finer mesh. But very few bats actually get caught in them. That's because bats use a kind of biological sonar called echolocation to avoid obstacles and find their insect prey, even in the dark. So Kuczynska is also using a special bat detector. (SOUNDBITE OF ANABAT CLICKING) LACAPRA: To show me how it works, she carries the big brown bat toward a small device that's lying on the ground. It's about the size and shape of a paperback book. It's called an AnaBat. (SOUNDBITE OF ANABAT CLICKING) KUCZYNSKA: And so the AnaBat is recording these noises and playing them back to us in a range that we can hear. And it allows us to see if there's activity - bat activity - in the area. LACAPRA: Now, it turns out that cemeteries aren't just great places for spooky things like bats. SETH MAGLE: I mean, I suspect that most of the species that are found in cities are probably also using cemeteries. LACAPRA: Seth Magle, who directs the Urban Wildlife Institute in Chicago, says with increasing urbanization, it's critical that animals have places in cities where they can live. He says like parks, golf courses and other urban green spaces, cemeteries can also provide an essential refuge for all sorts of wildlife. MAGLE: Coyotes, red foxes, skunks, woodchucks, opossum, whitetail deer, beaver. . . LACAPRA: Along with more common city residents, like birds and squirrels. It's easy to see why animals would be drawn to a cemetery like Bellefontaine. It's more of a majestic, 19th century park, with thousands of big trees spread out over more than 300 acres. But Magle says some animals can forge even in a place that's just gravestones and grass. MAGLE: Species like coyotes are not terribly selective about that kind of stuff. It seems like mostly what they're looking for in these urban areas are rabbits. And rabbits like grass, so the rabbits will come in for the grass and then the coyotes may come in for the rabbits.

A century ago, miners working in California's Death Valley reported seeing big rocks on the desert floor with long trails behind them, as if they'd been pushed by some unseen force. Every once in a while, the rocks have moved again, but no one has ever seen it happen. Now after 60-plus years of trying, scientists think they have solved the mystery of the slithering rocks of Death Valley. NPR's Christopher Joyce reports. CHRISTOPHER JOYCE, BYLINE: For decades scientists have been trekking out to a dry lake bed called The Racetrack in Death Valley to see these rocks for themselves. Many are boulders weighing 500 pounds and leading up to many of them are those erratic trails in the sand. RICHARD NORRIS: They do things like, they take high angle turns, sometimes they reverse course. JOYCE: Geologist Richard Norris at Scripps Institution of Oceanography was very puzzled when he first saw them. NORRIS: They are just going, you know, every which way out there, but in a very regular kind of fashion, like, they're moving in fleets. JOYCE: Fleets of slithering boulders. Norris joined a community of scientists who had been obsessed with trying to find out what was going on here. There were several theories. One long-standing one was wind storms. Once, in 1953, a researcher landed a plane on the lake bed and tried moving the rocks with the wind off his propellers. The rocks didn't slide, though a few did roll. Some people thought maybe ice was forming underneath the rocks on cold nights and they were ice skating, but no one actually saw that happening. So Norris got together with his cousin, who's an engineer. They said, OK, what if we put GPS trackers on those rocks and video cameras around them to catch the rocks in the act? JOYCE: And no one ever said to you, Richard, you're nuts? NORRIS: Well, kind of. (Laughter) I think that a lot of people thought, you know, why are you putting GPS trackers on rocks? JOYCE: They set everything up and just waited. Then early one morning in December, rain had fallen the night before. A thin sheet of ice had formed over the lake bed or, playa, as it's called. There was a light breeze and then the sun came up and the answer to the mystery unfolded. NORRIS: The ice began to melt out in the center of the playa and the ice began to pop and crackle all across the playa surfaces. The ice began to move. JOYCE: Thin sheets of ice, dozens of them, 40 or 50 feet across. The wind was pushing each sheet over a film of water and watery sand, shoving them up against the rocks. NORRIS: It's basically being like, a tugboat or a bulldozer - it's pushing the rocks very slowly along. JOYCE: But by the end of the day, some of the rocks had moved hundreds of feet. The ice and water had evaporated and in the now dry sand, furrowed trails marked each rock's journey. Norris thinks the conditions for this to happen occur very rarely; once in decades perhaps and they had been very lucky to catch it. One of the first people they told about the discovery was Paula Messina at San Jose State University. She had written her PhD thesis on the sliding rocks and like many scientists, she believed that freak wind storms were moving those rocks. PAULA MESSINA: And even though they were showing me data and photographs, I still couldn't believe it. I went down to The Racetrack and had to observe it for myself because I thought, no, it can't possibly be. JOYCE: But now she says, she and scientists who believed the wind hypothesis are now laughing about how wrong they were and Norris is laughing with them. NORRIS: It's so much fun. Pretty much everybody was out there because it was a neat problem and it was fun to do. And I think there is no purer form of science than that. JOYCE: Norris's team has published the findings in the journal PLOS ONE. Christopher Joyce, NPR News. INSKEEP: Like a rolling stone. This is NPR News.

The company is disputing some of those claims in court in battles that could drag on for years, but there is another group of people who lost a lot of money after the spill. And they have never received any compensation. That's because their claims are tied to a six-month ban on new drilling that was put in place after the spill. NPR's Jeff Brady explains. JEFF BRADY, BYLINE: In a warehouse about 90 miles southwest of New Orleans, Patrick Roy is walking through what used to be his dream business. PATRICK ROY: We'll walk out the back of the shop to where the equipment is now. BRADY: Roy's company rented expensive machinery, such as huge pumps, to the offshore oil industry. After BP's 2010 accident, business was OK at first. But then the government placed a moratorium on drilling in the Gulf while it overhauled regulations. That's when Roy's business started to collapse. ROY: There are people that I've heard about that are getting money that probably shouldn't have gotten money or the amount of money that they received. But then you have somebody like myself that was affected by the spill, and BP says, well, I'm sorry, you don't fit any of our criteria to get money. BRADY: In a statement, BP spokesmen Geoff Morrell says the company should not be required to pay for losses caused by the government's drilling moratorium. He says BP had no role in deciding to enact the ban or in delaying new drilling permits. With no customers and no money from BP, Roy shut down his business. His equipment was sold to a competitor for a 10th of what he paid for it. Now he's back working for someone else and faces a lifetime of paying off debts because he doesn't want to declare bankruptcy. ROY: I have two beautiful little boys, and my wife ended up leaving me because of all this. You know, business is one thing, but losing family, that hurts. BRADY: New Orleans attorney James Garner says there are several thousand claims like Roy's. His firm is representing people filing some of them. Garner says the drilling moratorium was a reasonable step for the government to take after the accident at BP's Macondo well. GARNER: BP cannot get away from the argument that without the Macondo explosion, moratorium doesn't happen. BRADY: But Chapman University law professor John Eastman doesn't think that argument will stand in court. JOHN EASTMAN: The government overly compensated with a moratorium on all drilling that caused all sorts of economic dislocation in the Gulf. That was the government's action, not the result of the spill. And we ought to hold our government accountable for that, not people who had no responsibility for it. BRADY: Those hurt by the drilling ban can't sue the government. Eastman suggests they encourage Congress to pass a compensation plan. Meantime, the question of whether BP will have to play these claims will go to court next summer, five years after the spill. University of Alabama law professor Montre Carodine says slow legal processes often benefit parties with the deepest pockets. MONTRE CARODINE: And frankly, big companies like BP depend on that, kind of bank on that. They know that parties will not be able to hold on that long. And so a lot of times, they intentionally drag things out so that they can get rid of claimants in that manner, you know, wearing them down. BRADY: Back in Louisiana, Patrick Roy says he's still pursuing compensation from BP. But if it comes, it'll be too late for his business. Right now he's trying to sell the building where his rental company was located, hoping he'll get enough to pay off some of his creditors. Jeff Brady, NPR News.

It's small, black endangered bird that eats at sea but nests in the forest here at Butano State Park, an hour south of San Francisco. That's where Halbert is the park scientist. But this egg is a bait and switch - a trick egg that Halbert made. HALBERT: They're just chicken eggs. They're a small size chicken egg. We paint them to look like marbled murrelet eggs. SOMMER: The real trick is inside a egg, and it's a rude surprise. HALBERT: We inject about . 24 cc's of the chemical Carbocal - it make you feel ill or want to throw up. SOMMER: That's what Halbert is counting on. Marbled murrelets only lay one egg a year, and those eggs are a favorite snack for another bird - Steller's jays. Once jays toss their cookies eating a decoy egg. . . HALBERT: They will never want to eat it again. SOMMER: Food poisoning is not a normal approach to conservation, it's something of a last resort. Marbled murrelet populations have plummeted and the birds are notoriously hard to find. You only see them in the forest as they fly in around dawn. Their habitat is largely gone because most of California's old-growth redwood forests have been logged. At the same time, predators - Stellar's jays - have boomed in the area. So far, Halbert says the decoy eggs look like a promising solution. In a controlled study at Humboldt State University, the jays seem to learn. HALBERT: Seventy five percent of the birds that had been exposed to the eggs, refused to eat them again. That's a real success story. SOMMER: But the danger of outwitting a jay, is that the bird can outwit you back. HALBERT: Ravens, crows, jays - they're really, really smart. SOMMER: At a nearby campsite, researcher Elena West of the University of Wisconsin Madison has caught a blue and black Steller's jay. It's getting a small leg band as part of a study. ELENA WEST: Alright, buddy. SOMMER: Being the Einsteins of the bird world is a double-edged sword, West says. Sure, the Jays are fast learners. They may actually remember that murelet eggs taste bad. But real murelet nests are hundreds of feet up a redwood tree -- higher than the decoys eggs are being place. So Jay's may figure out they only need to avoid the eggs down low. To really help murelets, the behavior change may have to come from people. West has found the Jays are booming because they're eating a lot of human food.

But an army of volunteers is obsessing over the weather from the past. They're examining logs from old ships trying to see what they can reveal about today's climate. Here's NPR's Brian Naylor. BRIAN NAYLOR, BYLINE: It's a gorgeous summer morning, and Kathy Wendolkowski is working on her laptop in the kitchen of her Gaithersburg, Maryland, home. As nice as this morning is, she's focused on the weather one day many years ago - July 15, 1925. KATHY WENDOLKOWSKI: Wind direction is coming from the east. The barometer - 3. 18. NAYLOR: Wendolkowski is reading from the logbook of the Pioneer - a ship that 89 years ago was measuring the depth of the ocean near Alaska. The Pioneer's logbook can be found at the website oldweather. org. Wendolkowski is a volunteer, one of many who are transcribing the log's hand-written notes from their elegant cursive script to something that can be digested by computers. It's harder than it might seem. She remembers chatting with one of her fellow transcribers. WENDOLKOWSKI: One poor guy that - every day in the log at 6 o'clock they have suffer in the logbook and so, I'm like wait no, that's supper (laughter) because there's a tall thing on the Ps, so it looks like suffer. NAYLOR: Mariners have long kept meticulous logbooks of weather conditions and descriptions of life on board ship, and the National Archives in Washington has pages and pages and pages of them recorded by sailors on Navy and Coast Guard vessels. Along with the basic weather observations, the logbooks contain amazing stories of adventure, survival and tragedy. Archivist Mark Mollan opens the log of the Bear, which in 1884 rescued a party of lost arctic explorers. MARK MOLLAN: Here is the record dated June 22, Sunday, 1884. (Reading) Finding Lieutenant Greely and six men alive. The remainder of the party dead of starvation. Commander Schley and Lieutenant Emery landed at once with surgeon of ship, medical stores and provisions. NAYLOR: Another logbook contained a bouquet of dried flowers in its pages - no one knows exactly why - and then there are the logs of the USS Jeannette. Its journey began in San Francisco in 1879 - an ill-fated attempt to find an open water passage to the North Pole. Two months later, the Jeannette was surrounded by ice, north of Siberia. Archivist Mollan reads from the logbook. MOLLAN: (Reading) Calm light airs from the Northeast, all hands employed cutting the ice away from the rudder. NAYLOR: Mollan says the Jeannette was trapped in the ice for nearly two years before the sailors were forced to abandon ship. MOLLAN: They all had to make four small launches, dragging their scientific equipment and all the records that they kept for those 21 months while they were drifting in the ice, and so all these logbooks and the equipment were part of that expedition. And they rest on our shelves today. NAYLOR: It's a great story, but what does any of this have to do with weather now? Kevin Wood is a research scientist with NOAA and the University of Washington - old weather is his brainchild. He says the weather observations in the Jeannette's logbooks help fill the gaps of our climate knowledge. Take the observations of the ice, for instance. Wood says the ice that trapped the Jeannette in September all those years ago doesn't even exist that time of year anymore. KEVIN WOOD: As we recover more and more data and we can re-analyze the global weather patterns for those years, we're going to understand more about the way the arctic ice drifts and moves about in those days which it may or may not do today. NAYLOR: And he says scientists are able to do another cool thing with those long-ago climate observations. They can plug them into a computer and produce a detailed weather map for that time. But Wood says what's really important is what all those long-ago readings tell us about the climate and its effects from storms to ice flows today. WOOD: Whether those kinds of events have stopped happening, whether they're going to happen more often or less often, and that's the power of having a very long-term, complete reconstruction of the Earth's atmosphere. NAYLOR: Wood says the data has helped shed light on recent ice melts in Greenland. For volunteer Kathy Wendolkowski, transcribing the old logbooks is a way of honoring those who served on the ships and collected the data. WENDOLKOWSKI: It's just the human stories that are in these log pages that just - how can you not? (Laughter) That's what I get out of it. NAYLOR: Brian Naylor, NPR News, Washington.

But in a new occasional series for WEEKEND EDITION, we're going to take a deep breath and jump right in. Data - the stuff's been around for as long as we've had the tools to measure it and in recent years has exploded into an obsession for many as sources and ways to access them multiply exponentially. And it turns out numbers can tell us a lot about the way our lives are changing and why. But navigating all of this information can seem like a pretty Sisyphean task. You have to know where to look and what questions to ask. Mona Chalabi actually likes this stuff. She's a writer for the data journalism website FiveThirtyEight. com, and she's here to help us navigate one small part of the journey through data. So Mona, let's start with a single number. What caught your eye this last week? MONA CHALABI: It's the number 4,598. And that's the number of triplets that were born in 2012. And the reason why it struck me as really, really interesting is that that number has fallen. When I looked back at the historic data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, I noticed that 35 percent fewer women had given birth to triplets in 2012 than ten years ago. That seems really strange to me. NEARY: And is that part of an overall decline in multiple births? CHALABI: No, that's the really interesting bit. So twin births are actually increasing. In fact, the probability that a birth will be twins has risen by 50 percent since 1980, while all other types of multiple births have actually fallen since that time. NEARY: Any idea why that's happening? CHALABI: Well, when I first noticed the trend, I just assumed it had to be down to IVF. It's well-documented that IVF increases the chances of having a multiple birth. And I know that IVF is not only being used more often, it's also more successful. NEARY: Well, how does that explain then why there would be more twins and fewer triplets? CHALABI: Exactly. It's a real paradox. And it's partly because the medical technology that's being used in IVF is changing as it's learning about the risks that are associated with its use. So infants that are born in pregnancies where they have shared a womb tend to be born sooner and smaller than single birth babies. And that explains why twins are about five times more likely to die in infancy. And for triplets, the risk is ten times greater. NEARY: Is it possible also that parents who go through IVF treatments possibly don't use all the fertilized embryos? In other words, they might choose to give birth to twins as opposed to multiple births like triplets or quintuplets or quadruplets. CHALABI: That's also possibly a part of it. So actually, when the eggs have been implanted, they can kind of see that that has resulted in say, like, five embryos or whatever. And they can choose, basically, to only continue with twins, for example. But there's no statistics on that, so it would be pure conjecture. But we do know that because of these changing guidelines, the doctors who are using IVF are actually implanting fewer eggs, so that's kind of a really solid piece of evidence for why triplets are on the decline. NEARY: Well, is there any other reason that you've been able to track through data? CHALABI: So IVF doesn't explain the full story here. Actually a big part of it, or about a third of it, of the explanation, according to the CDC, is that American women are just choosing to have children later on in life. And because older women tend to produce multiple eggs in a cycle, they're just more likely to have a multiple birth. Even without IVF, the chances of a woman in her 40s having twins is like five times higher than a woman in her 20s. Neither of those factors, so neither the changes in IVF nor the fact that American women are giving birth later on in life looks set to change. So basically, as long as American women continue to have children later on in life and the IVF industry continues to evolve, you can expect to see a future with a lot more American twins in it.

The most comprehensive study ever on birds in America is out today. It's says many populations are in steep decline, even as others are doing well. NPR's Christopher Joyce has this story on the state of the birds. CHRISTOPHER JOYCE, BYLINE: Scientists from the federal government, universities and conservation groups - 23 organizations in all, spent years on the \"State of the Birds a Study. \" They looked at birds from different habitats. Shorebirds, like knots, grassland dwellers like Meadowlarks and birds that live in deserts and in wetlands. The upshot? PETER MARRA: If we were to give our nations birds a report card it would be somewhere in the C range. JOYCE: Peter Marra is a migratory bird specialist who works at the Smithsonian Institution's National Zoo in Washington D. C. He helped write the study. The birds in trouble, the report lists 232 species on its so-called watch list are in decline. That's especially true for those that live in forests and grassland areas like the pinyon jay and longspurs or in arid lands like the sage grouse. But numbers for other kinds of birds are on the upswing. MARRA: Several the coastal birds are indeed success stories. JOYCE: Coastal birds like, turnstones and or oystercatchers for example. Wetland birds that were once in danger are now doing better too, like wood ducks and ibis. That's partly due to recent laws that have protected and restored their wetland habitats. MARRA: These populations come back when we create the habituate. JOYCE: But Marra says bringing birds back from dangerous decline is sort of an admission of failure. The report emphasizes that it's better to focus on birds that aren't yet in decline and keep them that way. At the National Zoo Marra has netted a catbird. It's gray and nondescript. Catbird's are not in trouble but Marra says that was true of the American passenger pigeon too. Once numbering in the billions, then hunted and collected to extinction 100 years ago. MARRA: Our job should be preserving abundance, keeping species common when they're common and not let the passenger pigeon example rule the day. JOYCE: Most ducks for example are still abundant. Ken Rosenberg, he's a bird biologist at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology and an author of the report says hunters as well as conservationists deserve credit. KEN ROSENBERG: We've put a tremendous amount of resources and money into wetland and waterfowl conservation because of the hunters who contribute financially. JOYCE: Hunters help pay to protect wetlands where ducks live and breed. But Rosenberg says other bird habitats don't get much respect. ROSENBERG: An opposite situation might be grasslands and arid lands that are mostly considered to be, sort of wastelands to a lot of people. JOYCE: But that's where lots of songbirds are in trouble, birds like pipits and thrashers. Of course many species of birds have adapted as humans rearrange the landscape and some people say those that can't - well species have always been going extinct. ROSENBERG: Sure, we can exist and we can have all the nature disappear around us but, you know, what kind of life will that be? JOYCE: One way to keep the disappearances to a minimum is to track more birds to find out where they go and to protect those places. At the National Zoo Peter Marra holds a black-crowned night heron that his crew has netted. Last year Marra put a tracking device on this birds back. MARRA: Last year we determined for the first time that of the three birds that we tracked - one stayed in Georgetown. I was convinced it was in a dumpster eating prosciutto ends. The other two headed down to Florida. JOYCE: Florida is a crucial stopover for migrating birds like the these and it's a state where bird habitat is disappearing fast. It's the kind of place the report says, birds both common and endangered will need to survive. MARRA: So, why don't we let him go. All right buddy. Here we go. JOYCE: Christopher Joyce, NPR News.

And there's some news this morning - the U. N. 's weather agency says the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, which is linked to warming, reached a record level in 2013. In their annual report, the World Meteorological Organization says the increase from 2012 to 2013 was the biggest yearly increase in three decades. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: This could be bad news for humans and also bad news for birds. A study out today from the National Audubon Society suggests that nearly half the bird species in the United States and Canada - nearly half - are at risk of extinction if no action is taken to protect them. GREENE: David Yarnold is Audubon's president and CEO, and he said the seven-year study helped scientists understand the link between where birds live and the climate conditions they need to survive. DAVID YARNOLD: The report looks at the underlying causes of climate, things like temperature and precipitation and humidity. And then we overlaid on top of that decades' worth of bird census data so that we can correlate what's happened with climate with what's happened with birds. GREENE: So certain species of birds need temperatures, humidity, these things to sort of be at certain levels, and if they change, these species just can't exist? YARNOLD: That's exactly right. So what happens when 40 species of Western songbirds keep having to fly higher and higher up Western mountains to find places to live? What happens when Minnesota's loons find that the weather is just too warm for them? They may not be able to fledge; they may not mate; they may not be able to find familiar food. It's a little bit like going to a new place where you're not sure whether there would be water or power. Do you think that you'll be able to survive there? That's the question that this report poses. For 314 species, we know that there's a great probability that they're going to be facing very different climate futures, and their outcomes are really unsure. GREENE: So let me just zero in if we can. And you mention loons in Minnesota - this is the species the common loon. And I think we have a little bit of tape to play, if people might, you know, even recognize this. (SOUNDBITE OF COMMON LOON)GREENE: So describe this species for me if you can. YARNOLD: Yeah, so it's a lovely waterfowl. It's a bird that has been associated with Minnesota and with some other places in the Northeast for a very long time. And what the Audubon report says is that it's going to get too warm on a consistent basis for the loon to be able to spend its summers in Minnesota. GREENE: I could imagine, you know, if we lose some bird species in the United States, others from farther south will come up and replace them? YARNOLD: It's not likely that birds are going to migrate from Central and South America to replace them - maybe over very long periods of time that could happen. But remember, what we're talking about are changes at a pace and at a scale that we've never seen before. These are the kinds of changes to habitat that have taken tens of thousands of years in the past. And what worries me is that these are the changes that my 9-month-old grandson could see in his lifetime. We're talking about things that are happening now and through the end of the century. This year in Southern California, 90 to 95 percent of raptor nests failed. There were no baby raptors because of drought. These things are happening now; this isn't some distant future. GREENE: David, the headline that \"The Survival Of Half Our Bird Species Could Be At Risk\" is certainly attention-grabbing. In the debate over climate change, there are some who complain that sometimes there can be an alarmist quality to reports. What can you tell me about this report that would respond to that sort of question? YARNOLD: There are models, there are forecasts that are far more extreme than this report. If anything, this report is conservative at every step of the way. We took great care to not overstate data or conclusions. Nothing would make us happier than to be wrong about the fate of many of these birds. GREENE: David, we really appreciate you coming on the program. Thanks so much. YARNOLD: You bet. GREENE: That's David Yarnold. He's president and CEO of the National Audubon Society. And we should mention that common loon bird call you heard was given to us by the Cornell Lab of Ornithology. DAVID GREENE, HOST:  Global warming is something the planet will be wrestling with in the years to come. And there's some news this morning - the U. N. 's weather agency says the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, which is linked to warming, reached a record level in 2013. In their annual report, the World Meteorological Organization says the increase from 2012 to 2013 was the biggest yearly increase in three decades. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:  This could be bad news for humans and also bad news for birds. A study out today from the National Audubon Society suggests that nearly half the bird species in the United States and Canada - nearly half - are at risk of extinction if no action is taken to protect them. GREENE: David Yarnold is Audubon's president and CEO, and he said the seven-year study helped scientists understand the link between where birds live and the climate conditions they need to survive. DAVID YARNOLD: The report looks at the underlying causes of climate, things like temperature and precipitation and humidity. And then we overlaid on top of that decades' worth of bird census data so that we can correlate what's happened with climate with what's happened with birds. GREENE: So certain species of birds need temperatures, humidity, these things to sort of be at certain levels, and if they change, these species just can't exist? YARNOLD: That's exactly right. So what happens when 40 species of Western songbirds keep having to fly higher and higher up Western mountains to find places to live? What happens when Minnesota's loons find that the weather is just too warm for them? They may not be able to fledge; they may not mate; they may not be able to find familiar food. It's a little bit like going to a new place where you're not sure whether there would be water or power. Do you think that you'll be able to survive there? That's the question that this report poses. For 314 species, we know that there's a great probability that they're going to be facing very different climate futures, and their outcomes are really unsure. GREENE: So let me just zero in if we can. And you mention loons in Minnesota - this is the species the common loon. And I think we have a little bit of tape to play, if people might, you know, even recognize this. (SOUNDBITE OF COMMON LOON) GREENE: So describe this species for me if you can. YARNOLD: Yeah, so it's a lovely waterfowl. It's a bird that has been associated with Minnesota and with some other places in the Northeast for a very long time. And what the Audubon report says is that it's going to get too warm on a consistent basis for the loon to be able to spend its summers in Minnesota. GREENE: I could imagine, you know, if we lose some bird species in the United States, others from farther south will come up and replace them? YARNOLD: It's not likely that birds are going to migrate from Central and South America to replace them - maybe over very long periods of time that could happen. But remember, what we're talking about are changes at a pace and at a scale that we've never seen before. These are the kinds of changes to habitat that have taken tens of thousands of years in the past. And what worries me is that these are the changes that my 9-month-old grandson could see in his lifetime. We're talking about things that are happening now and through the end of the century. This year in Southern California, 90 to 95 percent of raptor nests failed. There were no baby raptors because of drought. These things are happening now; this isn't some distant future. GREENE: David, the headline that \"The Survival Of Half Our Bird Species Could Be At Risk\" is certainly attention-grabbing. In the debate over climate change, there are some who complain that sometimes there can be an alarmist quality to reports. What can you tell me about this report that would respond to that sort of question? YARNOLD: There are models, there are forecasts that are far more extreme than this report. If anything, this report is conservative at every step of the way. We took great care to not overstate data or conclusions. Nothing would make us happier than to be wrong about the fate of many of these birds. GREENE: David, we really appreciate you coming on the program. Thanks so much. YARNOLD: You bet. GREENE: That's David Yarnold. He's president and CEO of the National Audubon Society.

There was once a place on earth so overrun with giant meat-eating predators that even Tyrannosaurus Rex would've been nervous. Predators that were even bigger than T-Rex. And scientists say it's apparently the only aquatic dinosaur ever found. NPR's Christopher Joyce reports on the unveiling of this swimming monster. CHRISTOPHER JOYCE, BYLINE: Spinosaurus was 50 feet long, longer than a school bus. Nine feet longer than the biggest T-Rex. A replica of its skeleton is being assembled in a cavernous room at the National Geographic Society in Washington, D. C. As workmen finish erecting the exhibit, paleontologist Nizar Ibrahim, from the University of Chicago, describes the place in North Africa where Spinosaurus lived 97 million years ago. NIZAR IBRAHIM: I call it the river of giants with big predatory dinosaurs, giant fish, crocodile-like predators. In fact, the place is really pretty predator heavy, so I call it the most dangerous place in the history of our planet. JOYCE: It was swampy, with many rivers. Now it's a desert, where Ibrahim looks for dinosaur bones. But he didn't find Spinosaurus's bones exactly, they found him. We'll get to that story in a minute. But first, you've got to see this immense skeleton. It takes up most of the room. Its jaw is long with interlocking front teeth like a crocodiles. Good for catching fish - very big fish. Then there are the pits in its jawbones. IBRAHIM: These openings house pressure receptors to detect movement of prey underwater. JOYCE: Its nostrils are back near its eyes, better for breathing while half-submerged. It has a long serpentine neck, its front legs tipped with foot-long claws. IBRAHIM: Probably used to tear apart prey into bite-size chunks. JOYCE: Along its back, seven-foot tall bony spines stick up like a picket fence. In life, they supported an enormous, sail-like crest. And the hips and back legs - they're narrow and small for all that weight. On land, Spinosaurus probably shuffled on all fours. This was a creature made for swimming. Ibrahim describes all this in The Journal of Science. Now, there were big swimming reptiles in prehistoric times, but no swimming dinosaurs until this one turned up. In fact, Spinosaurus bones were first discovered 100 years ago by a German paleontologist in Egypt. Scientists were puzzled by them. Thomas Holtz, a paleontologist at the University of Maryland, explains why. THOMAS HOLTZ: A lot of the skeleton was missing. And it was sort of a mystery dinosaur. And the mystery was furthered when all the specimens were destroyed during World War II. JOYCE: They'd been in a museum in Munich that was bombed by Allied planes. Scientists were left with drawings and over time, a few more bones from Africa. Until now, they'd speculated that this creature lived on land and snagged fish out of rivers like a giant heron with teeth. HOLTZ: But we were wrong. And it just goes to show that, you know, evolution's pretty tricky. And it does all sorts of weird and wonderful things. JOYCE: But no more weird and wonderful than the way Ibrahim found this specimen. It started in 2008 in Morocco. A local fossil hunter showed him an odd chunk of bone - a dinosaur bone, but one that puzzled him. He didn't make much of it. Then several years later, he was visiting colleagues at a museum in Italy. IBRAHIM: My Italian colleagues said we have something that you have to see. It just arrived here, it's a partial skeleton and it was spirited out of North Africa. We don't know really know where it came from. JOYCE: He looked at the bones. IBRAHIM: My jaw just dropped. They were just long spines, skull bones, leg bones. And I thought this is amazing. And I saw something very familiar. It looked exactly like that chunk of bone I had seen in Morocco several years earlier. And I thought, you know what? This could actually be the same skeleton. And so I thought, you know, all you need to do now is travel back to Morocco and find this one man in the middle of the Sahara desert. JOYCE: If he could find that fossil hunter, maybe he could find the rest of the bones. Ibrahim searched for him - no luck. He didn't even know his name, only that he had a mustache. Then, last year, he was drinking a cup of mint tea in a Moroccan cafe. He was ready to quit. He looked up and there was a man dressed in white, walking by with a mustache - the fossil hunter. The man agreed to drive Ibrahim into the desert to a hole dug in a mountainside. And there was the rest of the dinosaur skeleton. Scientists now know what the real Spinosaurus looked like and that it swam. The Moroccan and Italian bones have been reunited and will go back to Morocco. Christopher Joyce, NPR News.

SeaWorld, which has parks in San Diego, San Antonio and Orlando, saw its attendance drop in recent months. The company blames that, in part, on fallout from \"Blackfish,\" a documentary film that's critical of the way SeaWorld treats its captive killer whales. NPR's Greg Allen has a report on how SeaWorld is trying to get past the film's bad publicity. GREG ALLEN, BYLINE: At SeaWorld's Orlando park, the noon show has just ended. A few thousand visitors stream for the exits. Chris Dold is SeaWorld's chief veterinarian. CHRIS DOLD: This is Shamu Stadium. We're standing here looking out over the front pool, where the guests have an opportunity to enjoy the show and see the whales. ALLEN: The show's over, but SeaWorld trainers are still working with the animals that are the park's main attractions - its captive killer whales. The killer whales, or orcas, are coming out of the water onto a slide-out, where they interact with trainers. DOLD: Tilikum is approaching the slide-out, and he's here with Trua. And so we have given the signal asking them to both slide up out of the water. (SOUNDBITE OF WATER SPLASHING)ALLEN: Tilikum is a large male and SeaWorld's best-known orca. He's been involved in the deaths of three people. The most recent was trainer Dawn Brancheau, who was killed in 2010, an incident that is the centerpiece of the film documentary \"Blackfish. \" In the film, critics like former trainer Samantha Berg question SeaWorld's business model using captive killer whales at attractions in popular entertainment. (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY \"BLACKFISH\")SAMANTHA BERG: It's time to stop forcing these animals to perform in basically a circus environment.  And they should release the animals that are young enough and healthy enough to be released. ALLEN: When \"Blackfish\" debuted last year, SeaWorld said little publicly. But things changed after \"Blackfish\" was acquired by CNN, which aired the documentary more than a dozen times, bringing it, CNN says, to tens of millions of viewers. Perhaps even more damaging to SeaWorld, lawmakers in California took up a bill that would ban using killer whales in shows. SeaWorld lobbied hard against the proposed law, and it was tabled. The company finally began a vigorous campaign on the web and social media. Dold says for him and others at SeaWorld, that was a great day, when they finally began telling their side of the story. DOLD: The frustrating thing is that at the root of the criticism is this sense that we don't care, that we're heartless in our approach to the care of these animals. And that's the main thing that is wildly off-base. We obsess about this. ALLEN: Over the last several months, while other theme parks did well, SeaWorld's attendance declined. Last month, the company finally conceded what many had suspected,  that the debate over captive killer whales was hurting its bottom line. The company's stock price plummeted by a third. Tuna Amobi, an entertainment analyst for Standard & Poor's equity research, says that he believes SeaWorld will eventually overcome its current problems, and it's still a good investment. TUNA AMOBI: The belief is that this sentiment will wear out. And the valuation at this level seems relatively attractive, you know, given the declines that we've seen. ALLEN: Days after its steep stock drop, SeaWorld took a step toward repairing its public image with the announcement of a new environment for its killer whales. SeaWorld chief vet Chris Dold says a new project called Blue World will greatly expand the orcas' habitat. Standing at the edge of a pool in Shamu Stadium, he says it will also add ocean-like currents and other features designed to stimulate and challenge the killer whales. DOLD: This is the best viewpoint to see that where our whales live today is a series of large pools - a very large habitat and facility. And Blue World is about doubling this entire space. ALLEN: It will cost hundreds of millions of dollars, with a first phase planned for SeaWorld San Diego. Tim Zimmerman, a writer for Outside Magazine and an associate producer of \"Blackfish,\" says that SeaWorld seems to be acknowledging the pools they've been using are inadequate. But he says the plan sidestepped key issues. TIM ZIMMERMAN: Nothing about enlarging the pools will deal with the stress and health issues associated with captivity. So to me, enlarging the pools shows that they understand there's a problem with the environment. But really, what they're doing is tweaking their captivity model as opposed to really taking a close look at how they could reinvent it or even transition away from it. ALLEN: SeaWorld doesn't expect to open its new orca habitat in San Diego until 2018. In the meantime, it's facing a new challenge. This week, some SeaWorld shareholders filed suit against the company, claiming that it lied about earlier attendance declines and its treatment of killer whales. Greg Allen, NPR News, Miami.

Later in the show, James Cameron returns with his journey from filmmaker to explorer and back. But first. . . (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"THE HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE TO THE GALAXY\")STEPHEN FRY: (As The Guide) This is the story of \"The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy. \"RAZ: This is from the BBC adaptation of the series \"The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy\" by Douglas Adams. And deep inside one of the chapters of one of the books in the series, there's a quote. THOMAS THWAITES: I guess it's not just the quote; it's the kind of situation the quote describes. RAZ: This is Thomas Twaites. THWAITES: I'm a designer. RAZ: And Thomas got kind of obsessed with this one quote a few years ago. It's at a point in the book where the main character, Arthur Dent. . . THWAITES: This mundane, normal kind of, you know, guy from South London, like me, finds himself alone on a kind of planet and on the other side of the universe. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"THE HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE TO THE GALAXY\")FRY: (As The Guide) He had been extremely chastened to realize that although he originally came from a world which had cars and computers and ballet and Armagnac, he didn't, by himself, know how any of it worked. He couldn't do it. Left to his own devices, he couldn't build a toaster. He could just about make a sandwich, and that was it. RAZ: And when you read that quote, \"he couldn't build a toaster,\" that just stuck in your mind? THWAITES: Yeah, and I just started thinking, God, you know, it's just so mind-bogglingly complex. I mean, I don't know. I'm just looking around the studio, this BBC studio in London. . . RAZ: Yeah. THWAITES: . . . And it's all kind of glass, steel, plastic, you know. Oh, somebody's pointing at something. Don't fiddle with the. . . THWAITES: Oh, what? UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Wood. THWAITES: Huh? UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Wood. THWAITES: Oh, wood. (Laughter). RAZ: Yeah. Yeah. THWAITES: Oh, yeah. RAZ: There's wood. THWAITES: OK. (Laughter). RAZ: There is wood in there, yeah. THWAITES: There's one small piece of wood, but it's plywood. And so that has been sliced and then stuck together with some kind of complex glue, and so, yeah. So basically, I don't think I could make anything in this studio. RAZ: Now, this was the realization Thomas had when he thought about that quote. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"THE HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE TO THE GALAXY\")FRY: (As The Guide) Left to his own devices, he couldn't build a toaster. He could just about make a sandwich, and that was it. RAZ: And if he had to, he realized he really couldn't make much of anything at all. THWAITES: So that's when I thought, OK, I'm just going to try and make an electric toaster starting from scratch. RAZ: Here is Thomas Thwaites on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)THWAITES: So I thought, OK, I'll try and make an electric toaster from scratch. And - working on the idea that the cheapest electric toaster would also be the simplest reverse-engineer. I went and bought the cheapest toaster I could find, took it home and was kind of dismayed to discover that inside this object which I had bought for just 3. 94 pounds, there were 400 different bits made out of, you know, a hundred-plus different materials. I didn't have the rest of my life to do this project. I had, you know, maybe nine months. So I thought, OK, I'll start with five, and these were steel, mica, plastic, copper and nickel. So starting with steel, how do you make steel? So I went and knocked on the door of the Rio Tinto Chair of Advanced Mineral Extraction at the Royal School of Mines and said, how do you make steel? And Professor Cilliers was very kind and talked me through it. And in my vague rememberings from GCSE Science, well, steel comes from iron. So I phoned up an iron mine. And. . . (SOUNDBITE OF PHONE RINGING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN: (Unintelligible). THWAITES: Hello, can I speak to Jonathan please? UNIDENTIFIED MAN: He's underground at the moment. THWAITES: Oh, he's underground - oh. Well, I'm sort of embarking on a project. I'm trying to make a toaster, and I need to get some iron ore to make the steel bits inside the toaster. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Yeah. THWAITES: And so I was wondering if I could come down there and get some iron ore. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Yes, you can do. THWAITES: Can I? RAZ: So Thomas traveled north to the mine. He went in, and he hacked away just enough iron to make steel. But he still needed. . . THWAITES: Copper, plastic, mica - which is this kind of heat and electrically resistant mineral - and nickel. RAZ: The amount of things Thomas discovered during the year he spent trying to make those things into a toaster is kind of mind-boggling. For instance, to get copper, he needed water from a mine. THWAITES: Because water that kind of trickles through will kind of start becoming acidic. And that will lead to this kind of slightly acidic water leaching out to the kind of minerals from the rock. RAZ: Once he distilled copper from that water, he went looking for the mineral mica. And he found it in the most remote place in Britain. THWAITES: You know, mica in its natural form is this amazingly sort of beautiful, transparent rock, really. So I was kind of hacking it off the side of a mountain in Scotland. RAZ: Nickel turned out to be pretty easy. He just melted down some coins. But for plastic. . . THWAITES: I realized that you can just about get to the Iron Age when you're kind of working alone. But in terms of making plastic from oil, there's no real way you can do that without a chemistry laboratory. RAZ: So he went to the local dump, and he found some plastic to melt down into a mold. Now, that all took nine months to hunt all this stuff down and assemble a toaster. And the final product looks, well - I guess you could sort of describe it as, like, a bunch - like, a metal stick hanging out of, like, cake batter, like something drenched in cake batter. THWAITES: Yeah, and it's got a kind of hole in the side, kind of half-resembling a kind of Stone Age toaster, like a sort of Flintstones-esque toaster. RAZ: Yeah. THWAITES: It's sort of grotesque in some ways, yeah. RAZ: I guess, like, I mean, this is - it's almost like you took this journey of discovery, like you really did. You literally went to all these places to get this material. THWAITES: Yeah, exactly. It was - I came to this realization that, you know, everything is just so highly advanced, even the most mundane sort of pen or pencil or, you know, like, exercise book. You know, the staples in this cheap exercise book, they're made of this amazingly pure-grade steel, certainly in comparison to the kind of metal I was able to make alone. But someone, you know, 200 years ago made a small, incremental improvement to a process which, you know, is kind of long-forgotten, really. But that has kind of contributed, in some way, to where we are today, really. It's like the whole history of humanity can be - you know, everyone who's ever lived can kind of be found in this, you know, mundane item - toasting bread. RAZ: Thomas Thwaites - you should really see his toaster and his talk at ted. com. By the way, he did plug it in once. Sparks flew, it overheated, and it burned out in about five seconds. But then it was sold to an art museum. What did they pay for it? THWAITES: Twenty-thousand pounds. RAZ: Wow. THWAITES: (Laughter) Yeah. RAZ: Did you get a cut of that? THWAITES: (Laughter) I sure did. RAZ: I'm Guy Raz - our show today, From Curiosity To Discovery. You're listening to the TED Radio Hour from NPR. GUY RAZ, HOST:  Today on the show - From Curiosity To Discovery - stories from dreamers, tinkerers, scientists and, yes, filmmakers about the source of curiosity and how it drives the things they do. Later in the show, James Cameron returns with his journey from filmmaker to explorer and back. But first. . . (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"THE HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE TO THE GALAXY\") STEPHEN FRY: (As The Guide) This is the story of \"The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy. \" RAZ: This is from the BBC adaptation of the series \"The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy\" by Douglas Adams. And deep inside one of the chapters of one of the books in the series, there's a quote. THOMAS THWAITES: I guess it's not just the quote; it's the kind of situation the quote describes. RAZ: This is Thomas Twaites. THWAITES: I'm a designer. RAZ: And Thomas got kind of obsessed with this one quote a few years ago. It's at a point in the book where the main character, Arthur Dent. . . THWAITES: This mundane, normal kind of, you know, guy from South London, like me, finds himself alone on a kind of planet and on the other side of the universe. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"THE HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE TO THE GALAXY\") FRY: (As The Guide) He had been extremely chastened to realize that although he originally came from a world which had cars and computers and ballet and Armagnac, he didn't, by himself, know how any of it worked. He couldn't do it. Left to his own devices, he couldn't build a toaster. He could just about make a sandwich, and that was it. RAZ: And when you read that quote, \"he couldn't build a toaster,\" that just stuck in your mind? THWAITES: Yeah, and I just started thinking, God, you know, it's just so mind-bogglingly complex. I mean, I don't know. I'm just looking around the studio, this BBC studio in London. . . RAZ: Yeah. THWAITES: . . . And it's all kind of glass, steel, plastic, you know. Oh, somebody's pointing at something. Don't fiddle with the. . . THWAITES: Oh, what? UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Wood. THWAITES: Huh? UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Wood. THWAITES: Oh, wood. (Laughter). RAZ: Yeah. Yeah. THWAITES: Oh, yeah. RAZ: There's wood. THWAITES: OK. (Laughter). RAZ: There is wood in there, yeah. THWAITES: There's one small piece of wood, but it's plywood. And so that has been sliced and then stuck together with some kind of complex glue, and so, yeah. So basically, I don't think I could make anything in this studio. RAZ: Now, this was the realization Thomas had when he thought about that quote. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"THE HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE TO THE GALAXY\") FRY: (As The Guide) Left to his own devices, he couldn't build a toaster. He could just about make a sandwich, and that was it. RAZ: And if he had to, he realized he really couldn't make much of anything at all. THWAITES: So that's when I thought, OK, I'm just going to try and make an electric toaster starting from scratch. RAZ: Here is Thomas Thwaites on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) THWAITES: So I thought, OK, I'll try and make an electric toaster from scratch. And - working on the idea that the cheapest electric toaster would also be the simplest reverse-engineer. I went and bought the cheapest toaster I could find, took it home and was kind of dismayed to discover that inside this object which I had bought for just 3. 94 pounds, there were 400 different bits made out of, you know, a hundred-plus different materials. I didn't have the rest of my life to do this project. I had, you know, maybe nine months. So I thought, OK, I'll start with five, and these were steel, mica, plastic, copper and nickel. So starting with steel, how do you make steel? So I went and knocked on the door of the Rio Tinto Chair of Advanced Mineral Extraction at the Royal School of Mines and said, how do you make steel? And Professor Cilliers was very kind and talked me through it. And in my vague rememberings from GCSE Science, well, steel comes from iron. So I phoned up an iron mine. And. . . (SOUNDBITE OF PHONE RINGING) UNIDENTIFIED MAN: (Unintelligible). THWAITES: Hello, can I speak to Jonathan please? UNIDENTIFIED MAN: He's underground at the moment. THWAITES: Oh, he's underground - oh. Well, I'm sort of embarking on a project. I'm trying to make a toaster, and I need to get some iron ore to make the steel bits inside the toaster. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Yeah. THWAITES: And so I was wondering if I could come down there and get some iron ore. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Yes, you can do. THWAITES: Can I? RAZ: So Thomas traveled north to the mine. He went in, and he hacked away just enough iron to make steel. But he still needed. . . THWAITES: Copper, plastic, mica - which is this kind of heat and electrically resistant mineral - and nickel. RAZ: The amount of things Thomas discovered during the year he spent trying to make those things into a toaster is kind of mind-boggling. For instance, to get copper, he needed water from a mine. THWAITES: Because water that kind of trickles through will kind of start becoming acidic. And that will lead to this kind of slightly acidic water leaching out to the kind of minerals from the rock. RAZ: Once he distilled copper from that water, he went looking for the mineral mica. And he found it in the most remote place in Britain. THWAITES: You know, mica in its natural form is this amazingly sort of beautiful, transparent rock, really. So I was kind of hacking it off the side of a mountain in Scotland. RAZ: Nickel turned out to be pretty easy. He just melted down some coins. But for plastic. . . THWAITES: I realized that you can just about get to the Iron Age when you're kind of working alone. But in terms of making plastic from oil, there's no real way you can do that without a chemistry laboratory. RAZ: So he went to the local dump, and he found some plastic to melt down into a mold. Now, that all took nine months to hunt all this stuff down and assemble a toaster. And the final product looks, well - I guess you could sort of describe it as, like, a bunch - like, a metal stick hanging out of, like, cake batter, like something drenched in cake batter. THWAITES: Yeah, and it's got a kind of hole in the side, kind of half-resembling a kind of Stone Age toaster, like a sort of Flintstones-esque toaster. RAZ: Yeah. THWAITES: It's sort of grotesque in some ways, yeah. RAZ: I guess, like, I mean, this is - it's almost like you took this journey of discovery, like you really did.

I'm Guy Raz. And on the show today - from curiosity to discovery. Stories about the source of curiosity and how it drives the things we do. So what drives your curiosity? NATHAN WOLFE: I think for me, what I became, just, you know, addicted to early on was finding new things. And it's sort of - in a very sort of basic way. It's a little bit like you're pinging nature. You know, science is this amazing thing where you can basically ask questions of nature and nature will provide some sort of answer to you. And there's something so incredible about being able to do that. RAZ: This is Nathan Wolfe. He's a microbiologist and something of an explorer. WOLFE: The reality is there's so much unexplored that's all around us, if we think about life in a slightly different way. RAZ: And he says to make those new discoveries, we don't have to look too far. Here's Nathan Wolfe on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)WOLFE: Recently, I visited Beloit, Wisconsin and I was there to honor a great 20th century explorer, Roy Chapman Andrews. During his time at the American Museum of Natural History, Andrews led a range of expeditions to uncharted regions, like here in the Gobi Desert. He was quite a figure. He was later, it's said, the basis of the Indiana Jones character. And when I was in Beloit, Wisconsin I give a public lecture to a group of middle school students. And I'm here to tell you if there's anything more intimidating than talking here at TED, it'll be trying to hold the attention of a group of a thousand 12-year-olds for a 45 minute lecture. Don't try that one. At the end of the lecture they asked a number of questions, but there was one that's really stuck with me since then. There was a young girl who stood up and she asked the question, where should we explore? I think there's a sense that many of us have that the great age of exploration on Earth is over, that for the next generation they're going to have to go to outer space or the deepest oceans in order to find something significant to explore. But is that really the case? Is there really nowhere significant for us to explore left here on Earth? RAZ: Nathan says of course there is. And the next frontier - microbes. Now, it sounds a little strange, I know. But there's actually so little we know about microbes, even the ones in our very own bodies. WOLFE: If you really just sort of think about the diversity of microbes that are on your hand, or on the outside of your coffee cup, there's likely to be unexplored, unknown diversity just sitting right there in that environment. And so I think one of the things that excites me as a scientist about that world is, sort of how much is left to discover. RAZ: You can experience like 6 billion moon landings every day, just on a coffee cup. WOLFE: (Laughter). That's exactly right, yes. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)WOLFE: We now know that viruses make up the majority of the genetic information on our planet, more than the genetic information of all other forms of life combined. And obviously, there's been tremendous practical applications associated with this world. Things like the eradication of smallpox, the advent of a vaccine against cervical cancer, which we now know is mostly caused by human papillomavirus. We now have these amazing tools to allow us to explore the unseen world. Things like deep sequencing, which allow us to do much more than just sort of skim the surface and look at individual genomes from a particular species, but to look at entire metagenomes - the communities of teeming microorganisms in and on and around us - and to document all of the genetic information in these species. We can apply these techniques to things from soil, to skin and everything in between. RAZ: We're just at the very beginning of understanding this whole new world of microbes. WOLFE: Absolutely. This is one of the most exciting things about being a microbiologist right now, is that the tools that we have for exploration sort of are, sort of the equivalent of telescopes and GPS systems that we have for navigating this unseen world, have exploded really even over the last 5 to 10 years. We could take a specimen, like, let's say we were to take a swab from your nose, for example. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)WOLFE: The first thing that we would see is a tremendous amount of genetic information. And if we started looking into that genetic information, we'd see a number of usual suspects out there. Of course, a lot of human genetic information, but also bacterial and viral information, mostly from things that are completely harmless within your nose. But we'd also see something very, very surprising. As we started to look at this information, we would see that about 20 percent of the genetic information in your nose doesn't match anything that we've ever seen before - no plant, animal, fungus, virus or bacteria. Basically, we have no clue what this is. And for the small group of us who actually study this kind of data, a few of us have actually begun to call this information biological dark matter. We know it's not anything that we've seen before. It's sort of the equivalent of an uncharted continent right within our own genetic information. And there's a lot of it. If you think 20 percent of genetic information in your nose is a lot of biological dark matter, if we looked at your gut, up to 40 or 50 percent of that information is biological dark matter. And even in the relatively sterile blood around 1 to 2% of this information is dark matter; can't be classified, can't be typed or matched with anything we've seen before. RAZ: All right. So let me make sure I have this right. You're saying that within our own DNA, there are these tiny bits of genetic information that no scientist has ever been able to identify, like, they don't know what it is and - that's crazy. WOLFE: Yes and you know, people think about the data revolution. Everyone's very interested in how much data is out there and how much data does Facebook have? And it seems like a tremendous amount. I'll tell you right now that most of the information content of our planet is locked up in microbes in the DNA and RNA of microorganisms. And we're only just starting to sort uncover what that means. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)WOLFE: At first, we thought that perhaps this was artifact, right? These deep sequencing tools are relatively new. But as they've become more and more accurate, we've determined that this information is a form of life, or at least some of it is a form of life. And while the hypotheses for explaining these instances of biological dark matter are really only in their infancy, there's a very, very exciting possibility that exists - that buried in this life are signatures, in this genetic information, are signatures as of yet unidentified life that perhaps will allow us to identify the cause of a cancer that afflicts us or identify the source of an outbreak that we aren't familiar with. Or perhaps create a new tool in molecular biology. A little over a hundred years ago, people were unaware of viruses, the forms of life that make up most of the genetic information on our planet. A hundred years from now, people may marvel that we were perhaps completely unaware of a new class of life that literally was right under our noses. There was a time not very long ago, when the discovery of unknown organisms was something that held incredible awe for us. It had potential to really change the way that we saw ourselves and thought about ourselves. Many people, I think on our planet right now, despair; they think we've reached a point where we've discovered most of the things. I'm going to tell you right now - please don't despair. This is honestly the most exciting period ever for the study of unknown life forms on our planet. The dominant things that exist here, we know almost nothing about and yet, finally we have the tools which will allow us to actually explore that world and understand them. Thank you very much.

And, Adam, you are up next. Can you introduce yourself? ADAM SAVAGE: All right. My name is Adam Savage. I am currently cohost and executive producer of \"MythBusters\" on the Discovery Channel, and I'm a lifelong maker of things and curious person. RAZ: So, I mean, does curiosity, like, run in your family? SAVAGE: You know, my dad was definitely a polymath. He was a painter. He was an animator, a filmmaker, a wonderful writer. But I'm trying to think if there was a moment I had - you know, he did make me a race car. I had this teddy bear named Gus, and I wanted a racecar for it. And my dad spent weeks out in his studio making this thing out of hardware cloth, like wire mesh you'd make a hamster cage out of, and fiberglass - polyester fiberglass, which I still consider one of the worst material to have to work with. And just the act of, I'm interested in a toy, I can make that toy, that's what he said to me by giving that to me. He didn't know how to do it. He was just winging it. And that was completely formative for me. RAZ: And like his dad, Adam's a maker. He's designed models and props for big films. But you may know him best from the TV show \"MythBusters,\" where he and his cohost, Jamie Hyneman, test out questions like, if you drop a penny off the Empire State building, would it kill someone? SAVAGE: We realized that the strongest episodes were the ones driven by the narrative of our curiosity, you know. That is the nature of science. It's often that you - you know, the discovery is not the end of a line of looking for something. It's tangential to it because something happens you didn't expect. Someone said that the phrase that typifies real discovery isn't, eureka, but, huh, that's funny. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"MYTHBUSTERS\")JAMIE HYNEMAN: OK, go ahead, Adam. RAZ: Has there been an episode where, like, the outcome was not at all what you expected? SAVAGE: Yeah, there's a really good example. There's a myth about a guy who got very drunk at a party and convinced a friend of his to drive him home, except the problem was his friend was legally blind. But they got home because he gave his blind friend directions from the back seat. RAZ: Yeah. SAVAGE: So Jamie and I actually got a real blind guy. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"MYTHBUSTERS\")SAVAGE: Jerry's 100 percent blind. We put him in the front seat of a car while we sat in the back on a closed course, of course. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"MYTHBUSTERS\")HYNEMAN: Start to brake. Now turn hard left. Perfect. SAVAGE: But to really tell the story, we needed to have a drunk person. So Jamie got drunk. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"MYTHBUSTERS\")HYNEMAN: Floor it. (Laughter) He knows better than to listen to me. SAVAGE: And the most astonishing thing happened that we did not expect at all was that Jamie's directions. . . (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"MYTHBUSTERS\")HYNEMAN: Straight now. Right, right, right, right, right, right. SAVAGE: . . . Immediately made the blind guy drive like a drunk person. RAZ: Wow. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"MYTHBUSTERS\")SAVAGE: I swear, he is weaving a lot more around the road. It's like - oh. Behind the car, it was totally clear that there was a drunk person in charge of the car. (Laughter) That's one of my all-time favorite results. RAZ: OK, so nobody exactly won a prize for that experiment. But the point is Adam checked out a weird idea, and he discovered something kind of interesting. And nobody got hurt. Here's Adam on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SAVAGE: One of the funny things about owning a brain is that you have no control over the things that it gathers and holds onto, the facts and the stories. And as you get older, it only gets worse. Things stick around for years sometimes before you understand why you're interested in them, before you understand they're important to you. When Richard Feynman was a young boy in Queens, he went for a walk with his dad and his wagon and a ball. And he noticed that when he pulled the wagon, the ball went to the back of the wagon. And he asked his dad, why does the ball go to the back of the wagon? And his dad said, that's inertia. He said, what's inertia? And his dad said, ah, inertia is the name that scientists give to the phenomenon of the ball going to the back of the wagon. (LAUGHTER)SAVAGE: But in truth, nobody really knows. Feynman went on to earn degrees at MIT, Princeton. He saw the Challenger disaster, and he ended up winning the Nobel Prize in physics for his Feynman diagrams describing the movement of subatomic particles. And he credits that conversation with his father as giving him a sense that the simplest questions could carry you out to the edge of human knowledge and that that's where he wanted to play, and play he did. RAZ: I mean, I think about this story, and you think, like, if Feynman wasn't that kid, if he didn't have that sense of curiosity, could he have gone on to do what he did? Like, it's almost like he had to ask those questions. He had to be the kind of person. SAVAGE: Yeah, I mean, he had the brain. He had the brain that totally wanted to exercise itself. There's another story about Feynman of him cooking a spaghetti dinner with a friend. And his friend, as he's breaking the spaghetti to put it in the pot, he notices that the strands of dry spaghetti don't just break cleanly in half, that there's often a third piece that springs out between the other two. RAZ: Yeah. SAVAGE: And from a material science standpoint, that is a strange behavior. And as the story goes, they never got to eat it. They ended up breaking every piece of pasta they could find in the house to try and figure out why the molecular structure of pasta led it to do this weird thing where it broke a third piece off. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SAVAGE: This is what really gets me going about science. Whenever I'm having trouble understanding a concept, I go back, and I research the people that discovered that concept. I look at the story of how they came to understand it. And what happens when you look at what the discoverers were thinking about when they made their discoveries is you understand that they are not so different from us. We are all bags of meat and water. We all start with the same tools. I love the idea that different branches of science are called fields of study. Most people think of science as a closed, black box. And in fact, it is an open field. RAZ: Do you, like, see the process of discovery as almost like a journey rather than a place that you need to get to to figure it out? SAVAGE: Oh, that's 110 percent. There is no end. There is no point at which you think, well, I'm done. There is the chasing the moment of interest and turning it into a moment of understanding, however small. RAZ: I mean, I guess I'm always amazed, like, when you talk to a child - right? - they're full of questions about just the universe, about everything around them, about why cars move and how they move and how a telephone works. . . SAVAGE: Right. RAZ: . . . And all these questions that, at a certain point in our lives, they're not answered. But we just accept that there's unanswered questions, and we move on. But, like, that's sort of sad defeat on the part of us adults, don't you think? SAVAGE: Yes, and I was very lucky that in high school I had two science teachers that were really influential on me. One was my freshman earth science teacher who, he would say things in class that would rock my world. And I was a lonely kid. I didn't have much to do at lunch, so I would go back to his classroom which was right across the hall from the lunch room. And I would sit there and just ask him questions. And this is - I like to say, this is so long ago, he was sitting there in an off-period, grading papers and smoking in the classroom. RAZ: (Laughter). SAVAGE: But he would sit and answer questions. And then, you know, any line of questioning leads to the ultimate I-don't-know. . . . RAZ: Yeah. SAVAGE: . . . Because we don't know. . . RAZ: We don't know. SAVAGE: . . . The most fundmental. . . RAZ: Right. SAVAGE: . . . Parts of everything. RAZ: Or sometimes, when you do have the answer, and your 5-year-old says, that's not true, you just say, well, if you don't think it's true, stop asking me. SAVAGE: (Laughter) And this teacher would sit there, and when I got to the end of line of questioning, he'd say, I have no idea. I don't know why the flame - I don't know why a candle flame goes pop when you flick it with your finger. RAZ: Yeah. SAVAGE: And for a teacher to say that to a kid is really important. It's actually critical for kids to learn that the people in authority don't know everything - in fact, really don't know anything. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)SAVAGE: We are all explorers. The people that made discoveries just thought a little bit harder about what they were looking at, and they were a little bit more curious. And their curiosity changed the way people thought about the world, and thus it changed the world. They changed the world, and so can you. Thank you. (APPLAUSE)RAZ: Adam Savage is a cohost of the show \"MythBusters. \" Check out his two talks at ted. npr. org. Oh, and in case you were wondering what does happen if you drop a penny off the Empire State building. . . (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"MYTHBUSTERS\")HYNEMAN: Three, two, one. SAVAGE: Ow. (Laughter) That didn't actually hurt that much. RAZ: Our show today, From Curiosity To Discovery, how it begins, how we keep it alive in ourselves. Stay with us. I'm Guy Raz, and this is the TED Radio Hour from NPR. GUY RAZ, HOST:  So today on the show, we're talking about how curiosity leads to discovery. And, Adam, you are up next. Can you introduce yourself? ADAM SAVAGE: All right. My name is Adam Savage. I am currently cohost and executive producer of \"MythBusters\" on the Discovery Channel, and I'm a lifelong maker of things and curious person. RAZ: So, I mean, does curiosity, like, run in your family? SAVAGE: You know, my dad was definitely a polymath. He was a painter. He was an animator, a filmmaker, a wonderful writer. But I'm trying to think if there was a moment I had - you know, he did make me a race car. I had this teddy bear named Gus, and I wanted a racecar for it. And my dad spent weeks out in his studio making this thing out of hardware cloth, like wire mesh you'd make a hamster cage out of, and fiberglass - polyester fiberglass, which I still consider one of the worst material to have to work with. And just the act of, I'm interested in a toy, I can make that toy, that's what he said to me by giving that to me. He didn't know how to do it. He was just winging it. And that was completely formative for me. RAZ: And like his dad, Adam's a maker. He's designed models and props for big films. But you may know him best from the TV show \"MythBusters,\" where he and his cohost, Jamie Hyneman, test out questions like, if you drop a penny off the Empire State building, would it kill someone? SAVAGE: We realized that the strongest episodes were the ones driven by the narrative of our curiosity, you know. That is the nature of science. It's often that you - you know, the discovery is not the end of a line of looking for something. It's tangential to it because something happens you didn't expect. Someone said that the phrase that typifies real discovery isn't, eureka, but, huh, that's funny. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"MYTHBUSTERS\") JAMIE HYNEMAN: OK, go ahead, Adam. RAZ: Has there been an episode where, like, the outcome was not at all what you expected? SAVAGE: Yeah, there's a really good example. There's a myth about a guy who got very drunk at a party and convinced a friend of his to drive him home, except the problem was his friend was legally blind. But they got home because he gave his blind friend directions from the back seat. RAZ: Yeah. SAVAGE: So Jamie and I actually got a real blind guy. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"MYTHBUSTERS\") SAVAGE: Jerry's 100 percent blind. We put him in the front seat of a car while we sat in the back on a closed course, of course. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"MYTHBUSTERS\") HYNEMAN: Start to brake. Now turn hard left. Perfect. SAVAGE: But to really tell the story, we needed to have a drunk person. So Jamie got drunk. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"MYTHBUSTERS\") HYNEMAN: Floor it. (Laughter) He knows better than to listen to me. SAVAGE: And the most astonishing thing happened that we did not expect at all was that Jamie's directions. . . (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"MYTHBUSTERS\") HYNEMAN: Straight now. Right, right, right, right, right, right. SAVAGE: . . . Immediately made the blind guy drive like a drunk person. RAZ: Wow. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"MYTHBUSTERS\") SAVAGE: I swear, he is weaving a lot more around the road. It's like - oh. Behind the car, it was totally clear that there was a drunk person in charge of the car. (Laughter) That's one of my all-time favorite results. RAZ: OK, so nobody exactly won a prize for that experiment. But the point is Adam checked out a weird idea, and he discovered something kind of interesting. And nobody got hurt. Here's Adam on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) SAVAGE: One of the funny things about owning a brain is that you have no control over the things that it gathers and holds onto, the facts and the stories. And as you get older, it only gets worse. Things stick around for years sometimes before you understand why you're interested in them, before you understand they're important to you. When Richard Feynman was a young boy in Queens, he went for a walk with his dad and his wagon and a ball. And he noticed that when he pulled the wagon, the ball went to the back of the wagon. And he asked his dad, why does the ball go to the back of the wagon? And his dad said, that's inertia. He said, what's inertia? And his dad said, ah, inertia is the name that scientists give to the phenomenon of the ball going to the back of the wagon. (LAUGHTER) SAVAGE: But in truth, nobody really knows. Feynman went on to earn degrees at MIT, Princeton. He saw the Challenger disaster, and he ended up winning the Nobel Prize in physics for his Feynman diagrams describing the movement of subatomic particles. And he credits that conversation with his father as giving him a sense that the simplest questions could carry you out to the edge of human knowledge and that that's where he wanted to play, and play he did. RAZ: I mean, I think about this story, and you think, like, if Feynman wasn't that kid, if he didn't have that sense of curiosity, could he have gone on to do what he did? Like, it's almost like he had to ask those questions. He had to be the kind of person. SAVAGE: Yeah, I mean, he had the brain. He had the brain that totally wanted to exercise itself. There's another story about Feynman of him cooking a spaghetti dinner with a friend.

We're headed down the stairwell. GUY RAZ, HOST: Earlier in the show, we heard from James Cameron who gave a TED Talk all about curiosity, and he explained how in the opening scenes of his film \"Titanic,\" he used small robots to explore the ship's wreckage. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"TITANIC\")PAXTON: (As Brock Lovett) We're good. We're good. Just chill, boss. RAZ: Those robots were hunting for treasure, but for James Cameron, the footage he was shooting was the real treasure. He filmed it himself, two-and-a-half miles below the surface of the Atlantic Ocean. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)JAMES CAMERON: And, you know, it took a lot of preparation. We had to build cameras and lights and all kinds of things. But it struck me how much this dive - these deep-dives - was like a space mission, you know, where it was highly technical, and it required enormous planning. And you get in this capsule. You go down to this dark, hostile environment where there's no hope of rescue if you can get back by yourself. And, you know, I thought, wow, I'm, like, living in a science-fiction movie. This is really cool. And so I really got bitten by the bug of deep ocean exploration. Of course the curiosity, the science component of it - it was everything. It was adventure. It was curiosity. It was imagination, and it was an experience that Hollywood couldn't give me 'cause, you know, I can imagine a creature. And we can create a visual effect for it, but I couldn't imagine what I was seeing out that window. As we did some our subsequent expeditions, I was seeing creatures at hydrothermal vents and sometimes things that I have never seen before, sometimes things that no one had seen before that actually were not described by science at the time that we saw them and imaged them. So I was completely smitten by this and had to do more. And so I actually made a kind of curious decision. After the success of \"Titanic,\" I said, OK, you know, I'm going to park my day job as a Hollywood movie-maker, and I'm going to go be a full-time explorer for a while. RAZ: A while has now been almost two decades. And during that time, James Cameron has made more than a dozen deep-sea dives, and he's produced seven documentaries about some of the deepest underwater spots in the world. He recently released an eighth which was shot during his deepest dive ever. (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"DEEPSEA CHALLENGE 3D\")CAMERON: Surface, surface, Deepsea Challenger. RAZ: In 2012, James and a team of scientists launched a custom-designed craft to the bottom of the Marianas Trench. (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"DEEPSEA CHALLENGE 3D\")UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Deepsea Challenger, copy. Understood. RAZ: And in that trench in the middle of the Pacific Ocean is the deepest spot in all the world's oceans. It's called Challenger Deep. And in homage to that spot, James Cameron named his underwater craft. . . (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"DEEPSEA CHALLENGE 3D\")CAMERON: Surface, Deepsea Challenger. RAZ: The Deepsea Challenger. CAMERON: I  remember on that dive, I got through my entire checklist like an astronaut, and I was doing all my check-ins and my navigation and all that. I got down to 27,000 feet, and I realized that I had just passed the threshold. It was deeper than the deepest prior dive I had on the expedition, which was 5 miles deep, which we did in the New Britain Trench a couple weeks earlier. I was deeper than the other deepest-diving man-submersible on the planet could go. I was in a terrain - I was in a territory where there was no potential hope of rescue from any other existing technology. So for the first time, I was thinking about, that's a lot of water over my head. RAZ: Yeah, I mean, I think at a certain point in the film, you say that if you put Mount Everest at the bottom of the ocean and then stack four Empire State buildings on top of it, you still wouldn't break the surface of the ocean. CAMERON: Yeah, which gives you a sense of how deep it is. Another way to visualize is, next time you're in a commercial airliner at cruise altitude of 36,000 feet, look down, and that's how far the bottom of the ocean would be under you if you were in a ship at Challenger Deep. RAZ: Wow. CAMERON: Yeah, exactly. I mean, you know, it's - you're a tiny speck. (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"DEEPSEA CHALLENGE 3D\")CAMERON: Surface, this is Deep-Sea Challenger. I am on the bottom. Depth of 45,756 feet and. . . And of course I blew it. You know, I mean, I didn't have anything brilliant to say. I hadn't thought - so what I did is I called in, I said I'm on the bottom, I called in the depth. (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"DEEPSEA CHALLENGE 3D\")CAMERON: . . . And life-support's good. Everything looks good. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Oh, my God. (APPLAUSE)CAMERON: And I kind of muttered to myself, well. . . (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"DEEPSEA CHALLENGE 3D\")CAMERON: Whatever I thought I was going to say at that moment wasn't going to be that. RAZ: (Laughing) How different was what you expected to see at the bottom to what you actually did see at the bottom? CAMERON: I think that I was surprised that there was so little visible life because even at five miles depth in the New Britain Trench, there were still worm tracks and small vertebrate tracks all over the ground. And so I thought, OK, extrapolating from that, there should be quite a bit down there. And what I found was. . . (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"DEEPSEA CHALLENGE 3D\")CAMERON: Flat and featureless. I don't see any animal tracks. Almost featureless bottom that looked like new fallen snow. (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY, \"DEEPSEA CHALLENGE 3D\")CAMERON: Unbelievable, like the moon. RAZ: So you spent three hours on the ocean floor, the deepest spot in the world. You've seen life that nobody has ever seen before and you've been to the Titanic - what - twice? CAMERON: We did three expectations to Titanic in total, two of which were internal surveys where we went in with ROVs and explored around inside the wreck. And I've estimated that I've spent more time on the deck of Titanic than the captain of Titanic did. . . RAZ: Wow. CAMERON: Because he was only on - the ship sank only a few days into its lifespan. RAZ: Right. I mean, that's a thing, like, it seems like you become curious about something, but you never - it's not like a journey to an endpoint. CAMERON: No. RAZ: It's not like, OK, I'm going to find out everything about it and then I'm going to move on. CAMERON: I eventually did move on, you know, I mean, I think after the third expedition I felt like even though there was more that could be found, that I had spent enough time to satisfy myself there. And I was happy to pass along the baton to anybody that wanted to come along afterward. But I'm a curious monkey. I mean, we all are to some extent. It's one of our great gifts as primates that we - you know, we want to pick things up and turn them over and see how they work and put them together and build tools. And, you know, science is curiosity acted upon, people going and investigating. Then one thing leads to another and pretty soon you've got a space faring civilization. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)CAMERON: So what can we synthesize out of all of this, you know? What are the lessons learned? Well, I think number one is curiosity - it's the most powerful thing you own. Imagination is a force that can actually manifest a reality. And the respect of your team is more important than all of the laurels in the world. I have young filmmakers come up to me and say, you know, give me some advice for doing this. And I say don't put limitations on yourself. Other people will do that for you. Don't do it to yourself. Don't bet against yourself. And take risks. And NASA has this phrase that they like - failure is not an option. But failure has to be an option in Art and in exploration because it's a leap of faith. And no important endeavor that required innovation was done without risk. You have to be willing to take those risks. Whatever you're doing, failure is an option, but fear is not. Thank you. (APPLAUSE)RAZ: James Cameron. His film about diving to Challenger Deep is \"Deep-Sea Challenge 3-D. \" He's taking a break from the ocean for a while. He's working on three \"Avatar\" movies set to be released on three consecutive Christmases starting in 2016. You can see his entire talk at ted. npr. org. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"CURIOUS\")BARENAKED LADIES: If I climb a tree just to see what I see, does that make me curious? If I make a point of just cruising a joint, would that make me curious? And if it's profound, this just looking around, well, then geewhiz. Don't call me crazy, I've never been lazy, curious it is.

And, you know, science is curiosity acted upon, people going and investigating. Then one thing leads to another and pretty soon you've got a space faring civilization. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) CAMERON: So what can we synthesize out of all of this, you know? What are the lessons learned? Well, I think number one is curiosity - it's the most powerful thing you own. Imagination is a force that can actually manifest a reality. And the respect of your team is more important than all of the laurels in the world. I have young filmmakers come up to me and say, you know, give me some advice for doing this. And I say don't put limitations on yourself. Other people will do that for you. Don't do it to yourself. Don't bet against yourself. And take risks. And NASA has this phrase that they like - failure is not an option. But failure has to be an option in Art and in exploration because it's a leap of faith. And no important endeavor that required innovation was done without risk. You have to be willing to take those risks. Whatever you're doing, failure is an option, but fear is not. Thank you.

I'm Guy Raz. And on today's show - \"From Curiosity To Discovery\" and how one often leads to the other. But sometimes, discovery isn't really an endpoint. It's years of false starts that occasionally lead to a tiny breakthrough. WENDY CHUNG: I guess I'm known as somewhat of a zebra hunter. RAZ: This is Wendy Chung. She's a genetic researcher and a pediatrician. CHUNG: You know, when people hear hoof beats, we say in medicine, you should usually think of horses rather than thinking of zebras. But many times families come to me after they've been to a lot of doctors for horses and haven't come up with the answers. And so they think there might be something more unusual or more esoteric. RAZ: Wendy is actually more of genetic detective. And the case she's been trying to crack for more than 20 years - autism. Here's the opening from Wendy's TED Talk. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)CHUNG: Why? Why is a question that parents ask me all the time. Why did my child develop autism? As a pediatrician, as a geneticist, as a researcher, we try and address that question. But autism is not a single condition. It's actually a spectrum of disorders - a spectrum that ranges, for instance, from Justin, a 13-year-old boy who's not verbal, who can't speak, who communicates by using an iPad to touch pictures to communicate his thoughts and his concerns. A little boy who when he gets upset will start rocking and eventually when he's disturbed enough will bang his head to the point that he can actually cut it open and require stitches. That same diagnosis of autism, though, also applies to Gabriel, another 13-year-old boy who has quite a different set of challenges. He's actually quite remarkably gifted in mathematics. He can multiply three numbers by three numbers in his head with ease. Yet, when it comes to trying to have a conversation, he has great difficulty. He doesn't make eye contact. He has difficulty starting a conversation - feels awkward. And when he gets nervous, he actually shuts down. Yet, both of these boys have the same diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder. One of the things that concerns us is whether or not there really is an epidemic of autism. These days, 1 in 88 children will be diagnosed with autism. And the question is - has that number been increasing dramatically over time? Or is it because we have now started labeling individuals with autism - simply giving them the diagnosis when they were still present there before? The next question everyone wonders is, what caused autism? In fact there's probably not one single answer just as autism spectrum there's a spectrum of etiologies - a spectrum of causes. RAZ: So the thing to know about Wendy Chung is that she never set out to crack autism. She was a genetics researcher who sort of stumbled upon a realization. CHUNG: I think the realization came to me looking or came to  several of us that genetics at least could be one of the factors in autism. It didn't necessarily mean that all children with autism had an underlying genetic cause but that it could be the genetic cause. RAZ: And that theory tested early in her career when she met a little girl named Nika. CHUNG: In that particular case Nika's parents came to me many, many years ago having done, you know, the best they could to try and understand what was going on with their daughter and why she wasn't developing the same as other children. RAZ: For example Nika couldn't speak. She clearly had significant disabilities including autism. CHUNG: But not any one thing that looked particularly unique. She looks like a beautiful healthy child otherwise. But she clearly had something going on with her brain. RAZ: And on top of that she'd get seizures - lots of them on a daily basis. CHUNG: She didn't have any family history of a similar condition. So there wasn't anything for us to think that it was something clearly running in the family. RAZ: And so Wendy Chung began to wonder what if the source of Nika's disability was a genetic mutation and what if you could identify that exact gene? (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)CHUNG: In certain individuals they can actually have genetic changes or mutations that are not passed down from the mother or from the father but actually start brand-new in them. Mutations that are present in the egg or the sperm at the time of conception but have not been passed down generation through generation within the family. So in fact at the Simons Foundation we took 2,600 individuals that had no family history of autism and we took that child and their mother and father and used them to try and understand what were those genes? To do that we actually had to comprehensively be able to look at all that genetic information and determine what those differences were between the mother, the father and the child. In doing so. . . RAZ: So as Wendy goes on to explain every single human cell is made up of exactly 46 chromosomes and if any one piece of those 46 chromosomes that make up the billions of cells in our bodies is out of balance it can have a huge effect on the way our brains function. And so in the case of Nika, the girl who was diagnosed with autism as a toddler, Wendy was able to map out her genetic information to try and figure out what caused her brain to function in the way it did. CHUNG: I still remember when we did that the only reason we were able to find the cause - it was literally like looking for a needle in the  haystack, was because we saw one single letter out of 3 billion alphabet letters we saw one single letter for Nika that was different from her mom and different from her dad. RAZ: Wow. CHUNG: Something we knew wasn't inherited from either one of them and suddenly when we looked at that particular place, that one letter that was different, we saw that it affected this gene called called snap25. RAZ: Wow. CHUNG: Which essentially affecting all different areas for Nika's brain as well as causing her seizures. RAZ: You were able to discover that one single genetic mutation and identify it and know that's where it came from. CHUNG: That's exactly right. Knowing that this was the problem meant that we could start the journey to trying to figure out how to fix it. RAZ: But I mean that journeys, that process of trying to fix it - I mean that could take decades. CHUNG: I think there are pieces of it we're cracking every day. In terms of understanding the complexities of the human mind I don't know we'll ever truly understand it. RAZ: Yeah, I mean do you sort of think about what you do as trying to crack a code? CHUNG: Oh absolutely. So, the first gene we identified for human  disease took me eight years. Last gene that we identified for human disease took eight days and it's really remarkable in terms of how quickly we can move forward. I think it's that puzzle that I'm so obsessed with is, at least from the genetic point of view, trying to crack that code about what those genes are and trying to put that into a massive, you know, puzzle in terms of how those genes fit together, how those proteins fit together, how those neurons fit together, what the different parts of the brain do and why they're different in some individuals. RAZ: Yeah, I mean do you ever come home at night and just think, I may never figure this out - like over the course of my career it may never happen. CHUNG: Well, I think, you know, the stark reality is for many of us we realize that there's only so much that we can do and mysteries like this really massively complex feats you have to be able to break down in pieces. But I think the humbling part of this is that the mind is just wonderfully, beautifully complex and we will start to understand parts of it. So there are just amazing opportunities we have to study this - like we didn't at generation ago. But even still it's - we're just wonderfully complex human beings and appreciating all of that is awe-inspiring. RAZ: Wendy Chung is a genetic researcher and a pediatrician.

She's a physicist at the Department of Bioengineering at the University of Pennsylvania. Bassett studies the interconnections of the brain and how those connections change over the time. This is work that could have a profound impact on efforts to improve how people learn or how they recover from brain injury. And she joins me now from Philadelphia. Professor Bassett, congratulations on the MacArthur and welcome to the program. DANIELLE BASSETT: Thank you very much. Thanks for having me. BLOCK: And tell us a bit more about your research and the work that you're doing in learning about flexible brains. What is a flexible brain? BASSETT: A flexible brain is a brain in which different pieces communicate with each other in a changing way over time. So there's - some of us have communication patterns in our brain that are more static or more rigid. And then others of us have very flexible patterns of communication. BLOCK: And if you're looking at scans or images - looking at those connectivity patterns, what does a flexible brain look like? How can you tell? BASSETT: The analogy that I like to draw is one with dance partners. So you imagine you go to a group dance, and you might be dancing with one person for a short period of time and then switch and dance with another person for a period of time. That's a little bit like what a flexible brain looks like. Different parts of the brain will communicate with one part for a certain period of time and then switch over and communicate with another part. This flexibility could potentially be related to how we change strategies or adapt to our environment or the task demands. BLOCK: And in terms of the applications or the implications of your research, I mentioned, you know, recovery from brain injury. How might your research relate to that? BASSETT: Well, for one, I think that it potentially gives us a predictor. So we can say if somebody comes in for rehabilitation one day, this is a good day for you to learn because your brain is in a very flexible state or this is not a good day for you to learn because your brain is not in a flexible state. And then our next question is how do we actually increase the flexibility of a brain? What are some ways that we can intervene either through drug therapy or through stimulation to enhance reconfiguration or flexible processes that will then enable rehabilitation to occur. BLOCK: What was the first time that you remember being fascinated by the brain and what was going on inside? BASSETT: It was very early. I was very interested in philosophy - philosophy of the mind and then started realizing that there's a whole science of neuroscience behind that. So that happened probably in middle school, I think. BLOCK: Yeah and were there things you were reading or thinking about in particular? BASSETT: There's not anything in particular that really drove it until I had a friend who went through a psychotic episode, and that really drove me to decide to commit my life to working on how the brain actually works. BLOCK: You know, I was just thinking that for somebody who does what you do - study the brain - there must be things that happen all the time in the course of a day in your own brain that you're sort of seeing as a scientist - sort of on the outside looking in, imagining what your brain looks like as it's doing what it's doing. BASSETT: (Laughter) Yeah. I think actually where that happens most is when I watch my 3-year-old son. The other day he told me, Mommy, the sky doesn't get wet when it rains. And I said, yes, you're right, Silas. And he said, Mommy, why doesn't the sky get wet when it rains? (Laughter) And I was like, well, gravity is pulling the rain down not up. This is interesting - the ideas that I probably haven't thought about since I was 3 but are occurring in his brain all the time.

BASSETT: The analogy that I like to draw is one with dance partners. So you imagine you go to a group dance, and you might be dancing with one person for a short period of time and then switch and dance with another person for a period of time. That's a little bit like what a flexible brain looks like. Different parts of the brain will communicate with one part for a certain period of time and then switch over and communicate with another part. This flexibility could potentially be related to how we change strategies or adapt to our environment or the task demands. BLOCK: And in terms of the applications or the implications of your research, I mentioned, you know, recovery from brain injury. How might your research relate to that? BASSETT: Well, for one, I think that it potentially gives us a predictor. So we can say if somebody comes in for rehabilitation one day, this is a good day for you to learn because your brain is in a very flexible state or this is not a good day for you to learn because your brain is not in a flexible state. And then our next question is how do we actually increase the flexibility of a brain? What are some ways that we can intervene either through drug therapy or through stimulation to enhance reconfiguration or flexible processes that will then enable rehabilitation to occur. BLOCK: What was the first time that you remember being fascinated by the brain and what was going on inside? BASSETT: It was very early. I was very interested in philosophy - philosophy of the mind and then started realizing that there's a whole science of neuroscience behind that. So that happened probably in middle school, I think. BLOCK: Yeah and were there things you were reading or thinking about in particular? BASSETT: There's not anything in particular that really drove it until I had a friend who went through a psychotic episode, and that really drove me to decide to commit my life to working on how the brain actually works. BLOCK: You know, I was just thinking that for somebody who does what you do - study the brain - there must be things that happen all the time in the course of a day in your own brain that you're sort of seeing as a scientist - sort of on the outside looking in, imagining what your brain looks like as it's doing what it's doing. BASSETT: (Laughter) Yeah. I think actually where that happens most is when I watch my 3-year-old son. The other day he told me, Mommy, the sky doesn't get wet when it rains. And I said, yes, you're right, Silas. And he said, Mommy, why doesn't the sky get wet when it rains? (Laughter) And I was like, well, gravity is pulling the rain down not up. This is interesting - the ideas that I probably haven't thought about since I was 3 but are occurring in his brain all the time. BLOCK: That's physicist Danielle Bassett at the University of Pennsylvania, one of this year's MacArthur winners. Professor Bassett, thanks so much.

BLOCK: One city wrestling with this problem is Satellite Beach, Florida. NPR's Jon Hamilton went to take a look. JON HAMILTON, BYLINE: When I arrive in Satellite Beach, the surf is definitely up. Short-boarders are carving across head-high waves. The ocean is so loud it almost drowns out the cicadas in this beachside park. I'm here to meet Dan Reiter. He's a long-boarder who lives a few miles north. DAN REITER: You came on a really good day, actually, because Hurricane Cristobal is out there and it's sending some heavy chop. HAMILTON: Reiter is 37. He used to live in Tampa. Then he discovered the surf breaks along this stretch of coast south of Cape Canaveral. He moved here for the lifestyle. REITER: It's one of the most beautiful places in the world to live and surf and raise your kids. HAMILTON: Satellite Beach is so wholesome and family-oriented that locals refer to it as \"Mayberry by the Sea. \" But there is trouble in this coastal paradise. It's on a low-lying barrier island that's getting lower as sea level rises. So communities are trying to adapt. I ask Reiter whether he thinks they'll succeed. REITER: The idea of planning is really important to lengthen how long we can stay here. But, you know, in the end it's the same as, you know, living on a fault line, or just living in general. You know that you're going to die at some pointHAMILTON: For a more optimistic view, I drive a mile inland - almost to the Banana River on the other side of the island. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)HAMILTON: All right, City Hall. (SOUNDBITE OF BEEPING)HAMILTON: Nearly 11,000 people live in Satellite Beach. COURTNEY BARKER: You can go back. HAMILTON: Thank you. Courtney Barker is the city manager. BARKER: How are you? HAMILTON: She says erosion and sea-level rise have been a hot topic here since 2004. That's when a pair of hurricanes scoured away the beach, damaged several properties and destroyed a waterfront home. BARKER: You know, when that house went into the water, that was very surprising to people. HAMILTON: Barkers pulls out a government flood map to show me where the damage occurred. BARKER: This is Shell Street. It's right there at the south end of our city. And it's a pretty popular beach access. HAMILTON: The maps show several areas designated as vulnerable to flooding. BARKER: I can find an aerial map. HAMILTON: About half the land in Satellite Beach is less than six feet above water. The most dire projections put some neighborhoods under water within a few decades. Barker says that's something the city can't ignore. BARKER: We have evidence of coastal erosion and we have flooding during rain events that has gotten worse, you know. And that's pretty much where we're at. We're at a point where we recognize that we may have a problem in the future. And we need to sit down with the public and hash out a way to address itHAMILTON: The question is how? At one extreme, the city could simply retreat, abandoning structures in harm's way or moving them to higher ground. Unfortunately, there's not much higher ground available. At the other extreme, it could armor the coast with seawalls and levees and dikes. The trouble is the ground here is so porous that water would still seep in. So next week, Satellite Beach will hold a public meeting to start debating how it can become more resilient. A couple of blocks from City Hall is a dock where I meet two people. They know a lot about the city's past and are trying to ensure its future. HAMILTON: Hi, Jon Hamilton. RANDY PARKINSON: Hi, Jon, nice to meet you. HAMILTON: One of them is Randy Parkinson, a coastal geologist. The other is John Fergus, a volunteer who has encouraged the city to begin planning for sea-level rise. HAMILTON: We step onto a pontoon boat, and Fergus steers us into a network of waterways. JOHN FERGUS: Where we are right now used to be palmetto scrub. It's now a canal. And where those houses are was Mangrove Swamp. HAMILTON: In other words, this is all man-made. We glide north, past Mediterranean-style waterfront mansions as well as older and simpler homes along the finger canals. Many of the houses are just a few feet above the high tide line. Fergus tells me this kind of development was pioneered in the 1920s by Charles Rodes. He's the man who transformed Fort Lauderdale's swap land into the Venice of America. FERGUS: His solution was to take a dredge, make a canal, dump the spoil next to the canal and, just like here, you magically then took low-lying swamp, and you elevated that the land. But not only did you have buildable land, it was waterfront land. HAMILTON: That's what happened here in the 1950s and '60s. Randy Parkinson, the coastal geologist, says a natural coastline retreats as sea-level rises. Dunes move inland - so do the mangroves and wetlands. But he says a man-made subdivision can't do that. PARKINSON: When I first came up to this area from Miami, I tried to find a wetland that had not been altered by human activity. But there are no natural habitats left. HAMILTON: In Satellite Beach, almost every buildable lot is occupied. The beaches are covered with sand brought in by truck. Even the city's nature park is on a man-made island. Parkinson says this highly artificial landscape is common in Florida. And he says it's a big problem in an era where the sea is rising and storms may be getting more powerful. PARKINSON: I see a train wreck. HAMILTON: And is Satellite Beach going to be part of that train wreck? PARKINSON: All indications are right now that it's trying to avoid that. HAMILTON: I ask how, and Parkinson takes me back to the Seaside Park where I talked to the surfer. He says this is where Satellite Beach is doing something very smart. About 15 years ago, it acquired a half-mile of coastline from an owner who'd been planning a condo. Parkinson says the city had a better idea. PARKINSON: Behind us is the dune, which would be the highest natural elevations. HAMILTON: He says the city rebuilt the dune then protected it by planting sea oats and building a wooden crossover for beachgoers. PARKINSON: This has essentially been restored. It is a buffer between the Atlantic Ocean energy and your urban landscape behind. HAMILTON: Parkinson says maintaining that buffer will give people here time to figure out what to do next. Dan Reiter, the surfer who fell in love with this stretch of coast, says he's not leaving any time soon. But he doesn't expect to stay forever. REITER: Let's just put it this way. My daughter is 7, and I'm not planning on leaving her the house as a legacy. So when she's 40 and 50 years old, I think we're probably going to be somewhere else. HAMILTON: John Hamilton for the NPR Cities Project. REITER: Maybe somewhere in Virginia, up on a mountain or some high ground - on a ridge somewhere. HAMILTON: Not the Virginia beaches? REITER: No. no. SIEGEL: Tomorrow on MORNING EDITION, we'll hear about an aggressive effort to move people away from the ocean in New York City. BLOCK: And we want your stories and photos of nature reclaiming urban space - maybe a tree flourishing in an abandoned house, a backyard turned fox den, a crack in a sidewalk brightened by flower. SIEGEL: Give us a glimpse of what's happening in your hometown of nature making itself known. You can do it through Twitter, Tumblr or Instagram. Use the hashtag #nprcities.

They must've loved it around here. And you find the remains all across parts of southern North America. SILVERMAN: Picture a heard of elephant-like creatures grazing in the fields south of Dallas alongside short-faced bears and saber-toothed cats. TYKOSKI: And then all of a sudden, around 10,000 years ago, they're gone in a flash. ETHAN BEASLEY: You know, it kind of makes you just sit back and think it was a lot different years and years ago. SILVERMAN: That's Ethan Beasley. He discovered the skeleton along with his uncle Marty McEwen last May. It was a typical day at the family's sand and gravel company, when McEwen hit something hard with the excavator. Beasley jumped down from his dump truck and brushed the brown dirt off a few feet of mammoth tusk. BEASLEY: We uncovered the end down toward the head. And for a long time we were just standing down there looking at it - really didn't know what to do. SILVERMAN: They called a paleontologist from nearby Navarro College. And for the next few months, a small team of volunteers worked to remove layers of sediment from the ancient beast, during which time Beasley became a sort of town crier, updating locals on progress. BEASLEY: When you go through town, people are like so they dug up the el - of course, they all call it elephant or dinosaur or something. They're like, y'all dug it up yet? Is it gone? How's it going? SILVERMAN: Columbian mammoths have been found across the U. S. and in Texas before. But this one stands out because the skeleton is nearly complete. Paleontologist Paul Sereno says usually bones have been scavenged by animals or washed away. This one has both tusks, which measure more than seven feet long. PAUL SERENO: The tusk will give you all sorts of details about the animal. If you section that, you'll be able to not only tell, you know, something about the age of the animal, but you'll be able to tell about climate variation literally year-by-year as the animal grew that tusk. SILVERMAN: Sereno, who teaches at the University of Chicago, says this relative to the living elephant can help us understand how fast a species can go from being at the top of the food chain to the bottom of a cement pit. SERENO: The idea of climate change, the idea of the changing earth is happening before us. And you look at an animal like this and you say as little as 9,000 years ago, there were long-tusked mammoths wandering around Texas. Pretty amazing.

It doesn't help at all to tell you that that stands for Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution. But the probe, which should reach the red planet later tonight, is on a mission of vital interest to anyone who enjoys living on earth. NPR's Joe Palca explains. JOE PALCA, BYLINE: You can describe the point of the MAVEN mission in one simple sentence. BRUCE JAKOSKY: The MAVEN mission is about understanding the history of the climate on Mars. PALCA: That the Bruce Jakosky of the University of Colorado in Boulder. At a news conference last week, Jakosky explained that something happened in the past few billion years or so that changed the climate on Mars dramatically. He says when you look at aerial pictures of the Martian surface, you see unmistakable signs that Mars was once upon a time a fairly wet planet. JAKOSKY: We see evidence for lakes, for river channels, a lot of evidence for liquid water that required a very different climate than the one we have today. PALCA: Because today, the surface of Mars is bone dry. So the question is, where did the water go? Jakosky says there are basically only two possibilities. One, it could've sunk into the ground. Or two, it could have evaporated and gone up into the atmosphere. MAVEN will study option number two. JAKOSKY: We're going to be exploring an aspect of the Martian atmosphere and upper atmosphere that really has not been explored in detail by any spacecraft to date. PALCA: There's not much left of the Martian atmosphere these days. Scientists think a stream of charged particles coming from the Sun, called the solar wind, is largely responsible for knocking a lot of the atmosphere, including water vapor, out into space. Earth's atmosphere is also blasted by the solar wind. But Earth's magnetic field deflects most of the particles in the wind around the Earth. It seems Mars also once had a magnetic field protecting it. But sometime in the past few billion years, that magnetic field went away - probably because the planet's core solidified. Without that shield, the solar wind was free to do its damage. Jakosky says MAVEN will study how the solar wind and other factors are affecting the planet's atmosphere today. JAKOSKY: We measure these things today, even though the processes we're interested in operated billions of years ago. By looking today, we can understand the processes and how they operated and extrapolate backwards in time. PALCA: And that understanding could help explain how major climate changes can occur here on Earth as well. This is a big night for Bruce Jakosky. He's been working on this mission for more than a decade. But before MAVEN can make its measurements, its rockets have to fire on time and for the right length of time. Guy Beutelschies is MAVEN program manager for Lockheed Martin, the company that built the spacecraft. He says mission managers have already sent the spacecraft its rocket firing sequence. GUY BEUTELSCHIES: The commands will execute according to the onboard clock. So there's actually nothing that the team needs to do. The spacecraft will execute all of those on its own. PALCA: Even though the rockets are set to start firing at 9:37 tonight, mission managers won't know right away if that happened. BEUTELSCHIES: Keep in mind it takes 12 1/2 minutes for the radio signals to travel all the way from Mars to the Earth. So we won't actually see the start of the burn until approximately 9:50. PALCA: The rocket burn should put MAVEN into an orbit that will take it 35 hours to make one revolution around Mars. BEUTELSCHIES says scientists ultimately want a much shorter orbit - about 4. 5 hours. But he says several more rocket firings are necessary to achieve that. BEUTELSCHIES: It'll be a six-week period where we will be getting the spacecraft all configured and ready to start science mapping. PALCA: And then Bruce Jakosky can start getting the data from the Martian atmosphere he's been waiting more than a decade for. Joe Palca, NPR News. ARUN RATH, HOST:  For a mission to Mars, it's got a distinctly unsexy name - MAVEN. It doesn't help at all to tell you that that stands for Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution. But the probe, which should reach the red planet later tonight, is on a mission of vital interest to anyone who enjoys living on earth. NPR's Joe Palca explains. JOE PALCA, BYLINE: You can describe the point of the MAVEN mission in one simple sentence. BRUCE JAKOSKY: The MAVEN mission is about understanding the history of the climate on Mars. PALCA: That the Bruce Jakosky of the University of Colorado in Boulder. At a news conference last week, Jakosky explained that something happened in the past few billion years or so that changed the climate on Mars dramatically. He says when you look at aerial pictures of the Martian surface, you see unmistakable signs that Mars was once upon a time a fairly wet planet. JAKOSKY: We see evidence for lakes, for river channels, a lot of evidence for liquid water that required a very different climate than the one we have today. PALCA: Because today, the surface of Mars is bone dry. So the question is, where did the water go? Jakosky says there are basically only two possibilities. One, it could've sunk into the ground. Or two, it could have evaporated and gone up into the atmosphere. MAVEN will study option number two. JAKOSKY: We're going to be exploring an aspect of the Martian atmosphere and upper atmosphere that really has not been explored in detail by any spacecraft to date. PALCA: There's not much left of the Martian atmosphere these days.

It was called Rebuild by Design, architecture and engineering firms proposed ways to protect against future disasters. Winners were chosen in the spring, now the challenge is acting on the plans. NPR's Franklyn Cater went to New Jersey to see how one of the ideas is coming along. It's called, the New Meadowlands. FRANKLYN CATER, BYLINE: The Meadowlands is a vast, marshy landscape along the Hackensack River. You may know it as the home of the New York Jets and Giants, more than 8,000 acres of wetlands touching 14 different municipalities. We're floating pass them on a pontoon boat. FRANCISCO ARTIGAS: So it's high tide right now. The salinity right here, this is brackish. CATER: Francisco Artigas directs the Meadowlands Environmental Research Institute. Also on board, an architect, who wants to remake the Meadowlands. Alexander D'Hooghe of the MIT Center for Advanced Urbanism. ALEXANDER D'HOOGHE: Even with the impoverished ecosystem it's so beautiful here. ARTIGAS: Oh, yeah,D'HOOGHE: So amazing. ARTIGAS: I can take you to places where you think you're in the Zambezi in Africa and you're just, you know, four miles from Manhattan. CATER: We can see the skyline from here. The area is beautiful blooming cord-grass waves in the breeze. And its industrial, bordered by a sewage plant, warehouses and highways that crisscross the marsh. D'HOOGHE: Just like this is an incredibly dynamic space from the water's point of view, water flowing in and out every day like a big breathing system. Same thing happens for a goods with trucks and logistics. Enormous massive movements, almost more than Manhattan, coming in and out here every day. CATER: D'hooghe calls the meadowlands Manhattan's backstage, the gritty storage space for a glittering city. It's vitally important he says, economically as well as ecologically and when Sandy hit here water spilled into some of these communities like an overflowing toilet. ARTIGAS: After rain events all the crap comes down. CATER: Literally. ARTIGAS: Literally. And supermarket cards, mattresses, everything is floating down this river. CATER: So the plan, pitch by MIT and a big team of Dutch designers with water management expertise, is to turn the Meadowlands in to a gigantic world-class park. D'HOOGHE: The ambition of the plan is by building a big floodable landscape reserve, to make that into the central Park for the metro area. CATER: The park would be surrounded by miles of berms to keep waters out of neighboring towns. Now thanks to the competition, Washington has pledged $150 million towards making that happen. And Alexander D'hooghe says the park and new flood protection should anchor a new band of development all around it. Design renderings show a practically glowing green space, ringed by new homes and businesses to take in the stunning views. D'HOOGHE I'm naive and I'm optimistic, but none of this is revolutionary. It's all perfectly possible. CATER: On shore at a restaurant near the river, supporters of the meadowlands project are discussing the way forward. MAYOR MAURO RAGUSEO: Well, I'd like to that I'm, you know, cautiously optimistic. CATER: Mauro Raguseo is mayor of Little Ferry, New Jersey, one of five communities slated to get a protective berm in the pilot project. He says to make this plan a reality and not just a multimillion dollar theoretical exercise, involves a lot of red tape. RAGUSEO: A whole bunch of environmental restrictions, permitting process. CATER: And choppy political waters - negotiations between municipalities, the state and federal governments, not to mention property owners. RAGUSEO: They want to know is a berm going to be placed there? Is their property going to be bought? Is it going to be taken? (Laughter) You know, these are all questions - legitimate questions. CATER: It's all a bit wonky, so stick with me. The money goes from HUD to the New Jersey Department of the Environment, but the state awaits paperwork from HUD to specify what's to be done. And there's this little detail, by law there must be a competitive bidding process for firms that do final design and construction. It's unclear if the originators of this idea, the winners of the contest get to guide its implementation. RAGUSEO: How that is accomplished we'll have to see. CATER: Down in the state capital, Dave Rosenblatt is in charge of engineering and construction for flood defense plans like this one. He says this is going to take years, a decade perhaps. DAVE ROSENBLATT: These projects are going to happen. Right now the projects exist as concepts, but those concepts have to be taken by us and reworked so that they become viable at the price that HUD is willing to pay for them. CATER: Remember Washington has pledged $150 million so far. That's just the kick start a pilot project. It would take billions to implement the whole plan. In Meadowlands towns I look for opinions. Few people know about the plan, but most people said something has to be done about the flood problem here. In Carlstadt, at a boat launch in the shadow of  MetLife Stadium, boaters,  Ron Saulsman (Ph) and Robert Klausa (Ph) tell me this. RON SAULSMAN: If it helps the environment and helps the residents in the area and the economy, I think it's a good thing to spend the money. ROBERT KLAUSA: I think they should do something with this place because it's just a waste of land. CATER: It's beautiful. KLAUSA: It's beautiful for the birds and stuff like that, but as far as industry, or people living and stuff it's - but that would be nice. CATER: That public enjoyment of the water and urban economic development, along with critically needed flood protection is really what the rebuild by design competition is all about. And standing on the waterfront, looking at the marsh, the warehouses and the high-rises in the distance, you can get a feel for their vision. For the towns involved it'll take serious persistence to navigate a maze of politics and investment in the years ahead. Franklyn Cater on the Hackensack River for the NPR City's Project.

And there may be no animal more beloved in Florida. Sorry, dolphins. It's the manatee that's the state's official marine animal. Manatees swim in the states' shallow bays, rivers and canals where they often encounter people. And that's where problems arise. As NPR's Greg Allen reports, residents in a Florida community are pushing the federal government to take manatees off the endangered species list. GREG ALLEN, BYLINE: Crystal River on Florida's Gulf Coast calls itself the home of the manatee. In winter months, when water temperatures drop in the Atlantic and Gulf, several hundred manatees congregate in the short river that shares the town's name. Matt Clemons is a wildlife biologist who often leads tours of the area by kayak. We're in the headwaters of the river, an area called Kings Bay. MATT CLEMONS: It's an area that there are some springs, so you will see some manatees in here this time of year. You'll have a few manatees that come in to feed. ALLEN: There was a time when the water in Crystal River lived up to its name. Over decades, though, with development and runoff, nutrients in the bay have promoted algae growth which has hurt the water's clarity. The manatees, though, keep coming. And Clemons says they're a major part of Crystal River's economy. CLEMONS: There is a power plant complex north of town. There's a major hospital. And there's manatees. That's pretty much it. ALLEN: Sixty-nine companies in Crystal River offer swim with the manatee tours. Also known as sea cows, they attract 300,000 visitors to the area each year. But not everyone here is thrilled by the manatees and the special attention they receive from the public and wildlife agencies. STEVE LAMB: That is the rock-star species of  U. S. Fish and Wildlife. ALLEN: Steve Lamb is one of the founders of Save Crystal River - a group of residents, many with waterfront property, who sued to remove the marine mammal from the federal list of endangered species. While the Fish and Wildlife Services own estimates, the number of manatees has risen in recent years. With the improvement, the residents' group believes the species should be moved from endangered to threatened. Over the years, the federal agency has designated the entire river a manatee refuge. It's imposed speed restrictions on power boats. During the winter months, it sets aside special manatee sanctuaries where boats are prohibited. Lamb says he and others worry that if manatees remain on the endangered species list, the Fish and Wildlife Services will impose additional restrictions on how they're able to use the river. LAMB: For 30 years, I've watched them take one bite at a time out of our community. And whether that's rules, regulations - whatever it is, we decided enough was enough. ALLEN: In response to the lawsuit, the federal government is now reviewing whether to reclassify the manatee as threatened. Environmental groups oppose any move to change the manatee's status. Pat Rose with Save the Manatee Club says record numbers of manatees have been killed in recent years, raising concerns about their future. In 2010, many manatees died from the cold, raising the death total for the year to more than 750. PAT ROSE: And then last year, 2013, that record was even broken with 830 manatees that died, of which 300 or so were red tide related. ALLEN: Red tide is toxic algae that had been a recurring problem in recent years. Hundreds of other manatee deaths were reported in Indian River Lagoon, a waterway on Florida's Atlantic coast that has become polluted from nutrient runoff. Christina Martin is a lawyer with the Pacific Legal Foundation, a conservative group that helped the Crystal River residents force U. S. Fish and Wildlife to reconsider the manatee's status - a recommendation the agency's staff made in 2007. Martin says the recent deaths are pertinent. But with births, she says, the manatee population remains at nearly 5,000, about the same as it was three years ago. CHRISTINA MARTIN: The population's grown substantially since the 2007 report overall. And it's not changed much even in spite of the deaths. ALLEN: While the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service reviews its status, there's another emerging threat for manatees in Crystal River - too much tourism. Touching or interfering with manatees is against the law, but the regulations are rarely enforced in Crystal River. Hundreds of thousands of people come here each year for one reason - to swim with the manatees. River guide Matt Clemons says many of the tours allow their guests to interact with and touch the animals. CLEMONS: They promote what's called passive interaction which is an oxymoron. You can't passively interact with someone. I mean, you can do passive observation which is the actual right term for it, but that involves a no-touch. ALLEN: Advocates worries that tourists swimming with manatees disturb at a time of year when they need to feed and rest. Back on Crystal River, Clemons paddles to a place that in winter is a manatee hotspot. It's one of the springs known as Three Sisters. CLEMONS: Early in the morning, you may have couple hundred manatees back in here. That usually changes as soon as the first of the swimmers hit. ALLEN: Clemons and others say stricter enforcement and more sanctuaries are needed to protect manatees from too much public attention. That would mean more rules and closer supervision by wildlife authorities, just the kind of thing the Save Crystal River group says it will fight to prevent. Greg Allen, NPR News.

BRUMFIEL: He boasted that not only was it cheaper than an American space mission, it was cheaper than a movie about an American space mission. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)MODI: (Foreign language spoken). (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"GRAVITY\")UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR: (As character) Mission abort. Repeat mission abort. GEORGE CLOONEY: (As Matt Kowalski) Explorer, this is Kowalski confirming visual. . . BRUMFIEL: The film \"Gravity\" cost $100 million to make, and India's Mars mission? AMARESH KOLLIPARA: Some of the publicly available numbers are in the $74-75 million range. BRUMFIEL: Amaresh Kollipara is managing partner of Earth 2 Orbit, a company that pairs private satellite providers with the Indian space agency so they can use Indian rockets to get into orbit. Now, Kollipara doesn't quite buy the movie comparison. He says that $70-some million number comes down to some slightly fuzzy accounting. The mission probably cost more. But India still spent way less than what NASA pays to go to Mars. KOLLIPARA: Yes, the Indian price tag is much, much lower. BRUMFIEL: In fact this week, a NASA mission also reached the red planet. Its trip was way more expensive. BRUCE JAKOSKY: Six-hundred-and-thirty-seven million and we came in under budget. BRUMFIEL: That's Bruce Jakosky who's leading the NASA mission called Maven. So why did the NASA one cost so much more? JAKOSKY: People have held off asking but we've been expecting that question. BRUMFIEL: OK, so there's some obvious differences. The Indian spacecraft had fewer cameras and science doohickeys. If the NASA mission is a Mercedes, then this is a Honda Civic. But the Indians also chose a cheaper orbit around Mars. JAKOSKY: When you go into orbit, you do it by firing your rocket engines to slow down. BRUMFIEL: And how much you slow down determines the shape of your orbit. Now, the NASA mission wanted a nice circular orbit so it had to fire its engines a lot. India is orbiting in a big oval with Mars at one end. It means the spacecraft only gets close to Mars once every few days but the oval orbit required fewer rocket firings. That meant the spacecraft carried less fuel and weighed less, around half the weight of the NASA mission. So it was a lot cheaper to launch from Earth. The other big cost saver was back on Earth. It takes a lot of people to build a spacecraft. JAKOSKY: We had, at one point, over 600 people working on the project. BRUMFIEL: And those people need to be paid. India, it turns out, has loads of top-notch aerospace engineers and Amaresh Kollipara says they're cheap. KOLLIPARA: One number that I did here was around 50,000 or 60,000 rupees a month, which is about a thousand dollars a month. I can assure you that a lot of NASA engineers earn a lot more than that. BRUMFIEL: Space makes the headlines but Kollipara says India's affordable engineers are hard at work in other parts of the economy as well. KOLLIPARA: The aerospace industry is one area. This Mars mission is an example. The automotive industry, there's a growing high-tech R-and-D industry. There will be more precision-type manufacturing across various industries, I think, coming out of India over the next 10 years. BRUMFIEL: And India's space ambitions aren't over either. The next step may be putting an astronaut into orbit. Geoff Brumfiel, NPR News. SCOTT SIMON, HOST:  I'm Scott Simon. India did something utterly remarkable this week. It put a spacecraft into orbit around Mars. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: And you can see the excitement among all the scientists. They are all having beaming faces and congratulating each other on the Mars orbit insertion. SIMON: India's achievement is all the more remarkable because the nation made it to Mars for a fraction of what it cost the United States and Europe to send their probes. We ask NPR's Geoff Brumfiel to figure out how India made the journey on a budget.

Is this climate change at work? It's a question scientists have struggled with for years. NPR's Christopher Joyce reports on a new field of research that's providing some answers. CHRISTOPHER JOYCE, BYLINE: Climate scientists expect that as the planet warms there will be more extreme weather events - heat waves, droughts, huge storms. But there's always been unusual extreme weather, long before climate change. So scientists have had a rule, a kind of mantra. You cannot attribute any single weather event to climate change. It could be just weird weather. Then they took a close look at last year's heat wave in Australia. PETER STOTT: The chances of observing such extreme Australian temperatures, it's almost, almost impossible. It's hard to imagine how you could have had those temperatures in a world without climate change. JOYCE: Peter Stott is a climate scientist with Great Britain's Hadley Center. He's one of a group of researchers who are analyzing the patterns of extreme weather events in the past and comparing them to what they're seeing now. And the intensity of last year's Australian heat wave was statistically off the charts. He says it had to be climate change that made it so unusual. This is called attribution research. That is, figuring out how and when to attribute a mega-flood or a heat wave to global warming and when not to. Martin Hoerling, who's with NOAA, the government's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, is also part of this climate forensics movement. MARTIN HOERLING: It's almost for granted that climate change is influencing all manners of weather events. It's a question now that we are posing how did it influence, and in which direction? Did it make it more likely or less likely, and by how much more likely and by how much less likely? JOYCE: Dozens of these researchers just published an analysis of 16 weather events from 2013 in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society. And what they found was a mixed bag. Some events, like the big floods in Colorado, were not that unusual but intense heat waves in the Western Pacific did look like climate change was involved. The ongoing California drought drew opposing views. Two research teams said they couldn't find any reason to blame climate change. But Noah Diffenbaugh of Stanford University, who's part of a third team that examined the drought, says he did. He says there's a very rare high pressure ridge in the atmosphere over the North Pacific. And this is diverting moisture away from California, exacerbating the drought. NOAH DIFFENBAUGH: It's very likely that the global warming that's already happened has at least tripled the probability of this atmospheric condition occurring. JOYCE: This difference of opinion over the California drought is typical of this new science. It's still a work in progress. Researchers need more data on weather events in the past, as well as what's happening now, to improve their ability to separate natural variability from the effects of human activity on the climate. Researcher Tom Peterson from NOAA says eventually he hopes researchers will be able to go beyond attributing extreme weather to climate change. And actually predict the risk of these events in a warmer world, whether, for example, the California drought can be expected ever once every 500 years. . . TOM PETERSON: Or whether now it's a once in a hundred year drought because of climate change. And it's expected to become, you know, by the end of the century, a once in a 50 year drought. JOYCE: This kind of information will help people prepare in a world that's already changing in front of us. Christopher Joyce, NPR News.

The Miao Room was discovered in 1989 but laser mapping technology has only just determined how really big it is. The ceiling rises nearly a thousand feet high, the height of the Eiffel Tower. Andy Eavis has been exploring caves for more than 50 years and helped map the Miao Room. He says you can't just walk right in. ANDY EAVIS: At the entrance, there's actually a canal, a lake. So you either have to swim or use a small boat to get in the first couple of hundred of meters. But where you get out of the water is where the chamber begins to get large. And when I say large, it gets absolutely enormous. So the only thing you see is the floor that you're standing on. Unless you have a particularly powerful light, you simply see the floor. You don't see the walls, and you don't see the ceiling. SHAPIRO: I know you've been doing this for decades but there must be at least a little bit of fear involved, right? EAVIS: Probably wrong. SHAPIRO: Really? EAVIS: If I'm doing something particularly exposed like a big drop or a big climb, yeah, there'll be an element of adrenaline. But when you're just walking around in these big caves, no. It's pure pleasure. The scenery is something spectacular. SHAPIRO: What is that underground scenery in the Miao Room? You describe this epic blackness so large your flashlight can't even pierce through to the other side of it. What is the scenery? EAVIS: It's underground sculpture, often in beautiful white colors, whites and browns and blues and greens. And some of these formations are up to 150 feet high. And although we can't see the walls and the ceiling of the chamber, we can very often see beautiful calcite formations and big crystal flowers and big crystal fans and dams and fresh clean water dribbling through, cascading over beautiful white crystal formations. Stunning, beautiful stuff. SHAPIRO: It sounds like something out of Lewis Carroll. EAVIS: Yes, it is. Better. Better. Lewis Carroll never imagined anything as lovely as some of these. SHAPIRO: That's underground explorer Andy Eavis speaking with us from Australia about the Miao Room in China, recently shown to be the largest underground chamber in the world. Thanks so much.

And when I say large, it gets absolutely enormous. So the only thing you see is the floor that you're standing on. Unless you have a particularly powerful light, you simply see the floor. You don't see the walls, and you don't see the ceiling. SHAPIRO: I know you've been doing this for decades but there must be at least a little bit of fear involved, right? EAVIS: Probably wrong. SHAPIRO: Really? EAVIS: If I'm doing something particularly exposed like a big drop or a big climb, yeah, there'll be an element of adrenaline. But when you're just walking around in these big caves, no. It's pure pleasure. The scenery is something spectacular. SHAPIRO: What is that underground scenery in the Miao Room? You describe this epic blackness so large your flashlight can't even pierce through to the other side of it. What is the scenery? EAVIS: It's underground sculpture, often in beautiful white colors, whites and browns and blues and greens. And some of these formations are up to 150 feet high. And although we can't see the walls and the ceiling of the chamber, we can very often see beautiful calcite formations and big crystal flowers and big crystal fans and dams and fresh clean water dribbling through, cascading over beautiful white crystal formations. Stunning, beautiful stuff. SHAPIRO: It sounds like something out of Lewis Carroll. EAVIS: Yes, it is. Better. Better. Lewis Carroll never imagined anything as lovely as some of these. SHAPIRO: That's underground explorer Andy Eavis speaking with us from Australia about the Miao Room in China, recently shown to be the largest underground chamber in the world. Thanks so much.

The 1. 1 million-dollar prize will be split between John O'Keefe of University College London and a husband-and-wife team, May-Britt and Edvard Moser of the Norwegian University in Trondheim. NPR's Rob Stein explains why they won. ROB STEIN, BYLINE: The three neuroscientists won for discovering what the Nobel committee calls our inner GPS. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)OLE KIEHN: An inner GPS that makes it possible to know where we are and find our way. STEIN: That's Ole Kiehn, a professor of neuroscience who helped pick the winners. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)KIEHN: The abilities to know where we are and find our way are essential to our existence. STEIN: How our brains do this has fascinated and puzzled philosophers and scientists for hundreds of years. Then John O'Keefe made a crucial discovery in 1971. He measured the activity of cells in a part of the brain called the hippocampus as rats moved around the room. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)KIEHN: And much to his surprise, he found in hippocampus nerve cells that were only active when a rat was in a certain position in the environment. STEIN: And when the rats were in a different place, different cells became active. He called these place cells. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)KIEHN: The place cells in hippocampus generate many inner maps of the environment which gives us information about where we are and how we can recognize new environments. STEIN: More than three decades later, the Mosers discovered another part of the brain's GPS system while studying connections between nerve cells. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)KIEHN: They discovered a complete new type of nerve cell activity. STEIN: Nerve cell activity by cells they called grid cells because they create a kind of mental grid in the brain. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)KIEHN: Activity in many grid cells provide the brain with a coordinate system that allows to keep track on how far we are from a starting point and the turning point. STEIN: And that's how we're able to figure out how to plan routes to get from one place to another. The committee says the discoveries have led to fundamental insights into how the brain produces all kinds of complicated thinking powers like memory and planning. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)KIEHN: The discoveries by the Nobel laureates provided a paradigm shift in our understanding of how groups of specialized nerve cells work together to execute our brain functions. STEIN: The Nobel committee noted that one of the early signs of Alzheimer's disease is that people start getting lost and can't find their way home. So someday, this research might lead to ways to help people suffering from this devastating brain disease. May-Britt Moser described her reaction when she got a phone call from the Nobel committee.

These special tides occur a few times a year when the moon's orbit brings it close to the earth. But scientists say that lately even normal tides throughout the year are pushing water higher up onto land. As NPR's Christopher Joyce reports, that is causing headaches for people who live along coastlines. CHRISTOPHER JOYCE, BYLINE: The tides, as Bob Dylan might've put it, they are a changin'. High tides around the East and Gulf coasts are getting higher, to the point where regular high tides are beginning to look more like the rare so-called king tides hitting the East Coast this week. Ocean scientists say tides are higher because sea levels are higher. The result is a growing epidemic of small floods in coastal communities. WILLIAM SWEET: What we have found is that nuisance flooding has substantially increased in frequency. JOYCE: William Sweet is an oceanographer at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and substantially increased means a lot. SWEET: We had areas that were increasing by a factor of nine over the last 50 years. JOYCE: Nine times as many nuisance floods from high tides in some places. NOAA scientists say that follows from the fact that because of climate change, oceans, on average, are eight inches higher than a century ago. And, Sweet says. . . SWEET: It's going to get worse. Sea level rise is expected to accelerate during the next century as the oceans continue to warm and expand and the ice shelves lose mass as the water melts into the ocean. JOYCE: NOAA's conclusions come from a century of data collected by tide gauges placed along coastlines. The same data are the basis of a study out this week from an environmental group, the Union of Concerned Scientists, called \"Encroaching Tides. \" The report forecasts what higher tides could mean for 52 communities from Maine to Texas. Climate scientist Melanie Fitzpatrick is one of the authors. MELANIE FITZPATRICK: Certainly communities that are unfamiliar with flood conditions will start to see that flooding regularly. And our projections show that in the next 15 years, two-thirds of the communities we looked at could see a tripling or more in the number of high tide flood events. JOYCE: This includes cities like Boston, D. C. , Charleston and Miami. Fitzpatrick says communities have three options. FITZPATRICK: Firstly is living with it. Secondly is actually moving back, retreating. And then the third way of addressing it is to fortify or defend. JOYCE: The city of Annapolis in Maryland is doing all three. Annapolis sits at the mouth of the Severn River on the Chesapeake Bay. Founded in 1649, it was a colonial port. Life still revolves around the city dock. Workers today are preparing for the nation's largest sailboat show. Historic buildings from the 18th century surround the dock. LISA CRAIG: Our historic district is the economic core. JOYCE: Lisa Craig runs the city's historic preservation division. CRAIG: Look, we're standing here looking straight up at the state house dome. It's a capital city. I mean, this is an iconic, historic community. JOYCE: And these buildings are now threatened by freakish high tides. In fact, nuisance floods here have increased from four a year in the 1950s to 40 a year now. Craig says people have learned to live with it. CRAIG: I walk down to the yacht club at 11:45 to go to lunch, and I anticipate on some high tide days that I'm not going to be able to walk back. I'm going to have to take the long way around. JOYCE: But the city is fortifying itself as well. New flood maps identify buildings in jeopardy. There's a tax break for owners who prepare for flooding. That could mean simply building a barrier across a door sill or windows, or something more robust. CRAIG: Some businesses may want to increase the height of the interior of a property and create a step up or two steps up if that's the case, or a ramp.

Working independently, they've figured out how to expand the frontiers of biology by allowing researchers to see far more clearly into living cells. And this isn't just a story of technology, but also of remarkable personalities. NPR's Richard Harris reports. RICHARD HARRIS, BYLINE: Optical microscopes have a problem. For more than 100 years the dogma has been that you can't improve their resolution beyond a theoretical limit. You can't see anything much smaller than the wavelength of light you're shining on an object. Stefan Hell was studying physics in Germany and was intrigued by this barrier, but his professors told him not to waste his time. STEFAN HELL: This barrier has been around since 1873 and doing something about it is kind of crazy, not very realistic to do. HARRIS: But Hell didn't take no for an answer. He exiled himself at a university in Finland and found a way around this problem. If the molecules you're studying produce their own light - if they fluoresce,  then you can use that light to see much finer detail. That discovery has won Hell a share of this year's Nobel Prize in chemistry. Meanwhile, Eric Betzig was chewing on the same problem as a scientist at Bell Labs in New Jersey. ERIC BETZIG: I worked on that for six years and started to realize the limitations of that technology and also kind of felt uncomfortable with academic science in general - particularly in applied technology. The hype exceeds the reality. HARRIS: He gave up and went to work for his father, who owned a plant that made heavy equipment used in factories, but that was a bust. BETZIG: A - I learned I was a bad businessman, but B - I learned that I missed science, even if I didn't miss academia. HARRIS: So Betzig took a new run at this old problem with a close friend and they too started thinking about using glowing chemicals. BETZIG: And the light bulbs immediately went on in our heads. And we said that's the missing link to make that idea that I had pitched 10 years before when I left Bell to work. HARRIS: Betzig's friend and collaborator was Harald Hess. He'd also left Bell Labs and was now living in the California beach town of La Jolla. Hess says they turned his living room into their laboratory. HARALD HESS: It was actually a very pleasant place. You know, we'd sort of play tennis maybe for part of the time then assemble the microscope for the other time. HARRIS: They bought parts off of eBay and elsewhere on the Internet and Hess says the instrument ended up being quite affordable. HESS: It was easy enough that we could just sort of self-fund it probably for less than the price of a new kitchen or anything like that. BETZIG: It went from idea to quality data in six months. HARRIS: Now, these guys were brilliant physicists so they knew how to make the microscope, but they didn't know how to make use of it. So they turned to a scientist they'd met at the National Institutes of Health near Washington. BETZIG: She said hey, bring it here, which we needed because we didn't know any biology. HARRIS: They set it up in the corner of her lab and rented a hotel room so they could hover nearby as biologists figured out how to make use of the instrument. Hess says their idea didn't make them rich, but that wasn't the point. HESS: For the fun it was definitely worth it. HARRIS: After this triumph, Betzig wanted to get back into a lab so he could further develop this microscope and others like it. One thing led to another and he was offered a job at a posh new laboratory being built by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, the Janelia Research Campus outside of Washington. Betzig took the job and has been there ever since. Hess eventually got a lab there, too. And here's the twist in this story - Betzig won this year's Nobel Prize for their work but Hess did not. Nobels are only split three ways and the third share of this prize went to W. E. Moerner at Stanford University. He's honored for the pioneering work he'd done on the glowing molecules that make these microscopes possible. Richard Harris, NPR News.

Seeing a prehistoric image of a horse or mammoth on a cave wall allows us to emotionally connect to the people who made those paintings tens of thousands of years ago. NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce reports that a new discovery about cave art in Indonesia is now challenging scientists' long-held ideas about the first cave artists. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE, BYLINE: The most famous painted caves are in Europe, but for decades researchers have also known about artwork on the walls of limestone caves and rock shelters on an Indonesian island called Sulawesi. MATT TOCHERI: Some of these pieces are hand stencils so basically they've outlined the shape of their hands on the cave wall. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Matt Tocheri is with the Human Origins Program at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History. He says other cave paintings there show local animals, like the babirusa. . . TOCHERI: Which is a very interesting pig that is only found on Sulawesi. GREENFIELDBOYCE: The animals are shown in profile. The artist drew little lines with red pigment to show the hair on their fat bodies. The artwork generally isn't well-preserved. Researchers thought these paintings must be relatively recent because the tropical environment would degrade things quickly. They figured these paintings had to be less than 10,000 years old. TOCHERI: The truth of it was no one had really tried to date it. It's not easy to date rock art. GREENFIELDBOYCE: A group of Indonesian and Australian researchers has now done a new analysis. They looked at mineral deposits that formed on top of the artwork. These mineral deposits look like tiny little cauliflowers. They're sometimes called cave popcorn. Alistair Pike, at the University of Southampton in the United Kingdom, has studied the age of European cave paintings using the same method. ALISTAIR PIKE: We're dating things formed on top of the paintings rather than the pigments of the paintings themselves. GREENFIELDBOYCE: He says what was found in the Indonesian caves was surprising. One hand stencil is more than 39,000 years old. One painting of that pig-like animal is more than 35,000 years old. In the journal Nature, the research team reports on art from seven cave sites. They say it's all about the same age as the earliest cave paintings in Europe. And Pike says this is a huge deal. PIKE: Because up until now, we've always believed that cave painting was part of a suite of complex symbolic behavior that humans invented in Europe. GREENFIELDBOYCE: It's possible that cave painting developed independently in both Europe and Indonesia at the same time, but Pike thinks it's likely that the origin was earlier and somewhere else. PIKE: And then individuals moved east to (unintelligible) to Europe, taking the tradition of painting caves with them. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Cave painting traditions might actually stretch way, way back. John Shea is an archaeologist at Stony Brook University in New York. JOHN SHEA: I think it's probably the case that the very first humans - the first people who looked like us, lived 200,000 years ago - had these abilities. GREENFIELDBOYCE: He says these people lived in Africa, but unlike Europe which has deep, cold caves that are excellent for preserving artwork. . . SHEA: Africa's hot and wet and the caves tend to be fairly shallow and the surfaces of the caves tended to decompose fairly rapidly. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Shea points to one site in southern Africa where archaeologists found 30,000-year-old images of animals drawn on rock slabs. And even more ancient sites in Africa showed that people were making beads and using colored pigments, presumably to decorate themselves, if not the walls of their home.

PIKE: Because up until now, we've always believed that cave painting was part of a suite of complex symbolic behavior that humans invented in Europe. GREENFIELDBOYCE: It's possible that cave painting developed independently in both Europe and Indonesia at the same time, but Pike thinks it's likely that the origin was earlier and somewhere else. PIKE: And then individuals moved east to (unintelligible) to Europe, taking the tradition of painting caves with them. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Cave painting traditions might actually stretch way, way back. John Shea is an archaeologist at Stony Brook University in New York. JOHN SHEA: I think it's probably the case that the very first humans - the first people who looked like us, lived 200,000 years ago - had these abilities. GREENFIELDBOYCE: He says these people lived in Africa, but unlike Europe which has deep, cold caves that are excellent for preserving artwork. . . SHEA: Africa's hot and wet and the caves tend to be fairly shallow and the surfaces of the caves tended to decompose fairly rapidly. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Shea points to one site in southern Africa where archaeologists found 30,000-year-old images of animals drawn on rock slabs. And even more ancient sites in Africa showed that people were making beads and using colored pigments, presumably to decorate themselves, if not the walls of their home.

I'm Scott Simon. It was six months ago when Russia sent troops into Crimea, quickly scheduled a referendum then annexed the peninsula. Sanctions imposed by the West have weakened the ruble and squeezed funding to banks and industries, but Crimea's annexation seems to be a done deal. Now, in a moment we'll talk to our reporter, David Greene who's in Crimea, about the changes that have taken place there. Ukraine would like the West to impose more sanctions, but that seems unlikely. Europe depends heavily on Russia's vast oil and gas reserve to get through the winter. Since 2009, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development has focused efforts on trying to reduce Europe's energy dependence on Russia. The bank is investing in renewable energy and improving energy efficiency. The recent crisis in Ukraine has made the bank's work even more pressing. We are joined in the studio by Suma Chakrabarti, the president of the bank. He's in Washington, D. C. for the annual meeting of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. Thanks for being with us. SUMA CHAKRABARTI: It's a real pleasure. SIMON: How dependent is Europe on Russia? CHAKRABARTI: Well, some parts of Europe much more than others. So if you look at the German energy market, Germany's much more dependent than say, the U. K. So it varies a lot. And in the case of Ukraine, it also - has been - quite dependent. SIMON: Is Ukraine particularly vulnerable this winter? CHAKRABARTI: Ukraine, I think, has enough storages of gas for this winter, but nevertheless, it's a long-term issue that Ukraine really has to address. SIMON: Yeah and it owes billions to Russia, doesn't it? CHAKRABARTI: It owes some on the contracts it has and there's a negotiation going on at the moment between Russia and Ukraine on those contracts. But the fundamental point for Ukraine is its energy efficiency levels are very low. If Ukraine could get to Western European levels of energy efficiency, it would actually need to import very little gas at all. SIMON: But how do they do that? CHAKRABARTI: Well, they need a lot of investment. There's no doubt about that and this is where the EBRD comes in, I think. We have to really help Ukraine with energy-efficiency credit lines through banks and so on. We need to get companies in Ukraine to become much more energy efficient. At the same time, we also need to help Ukraine with its immediate energy security needs, I think. One of the things we're thinking of doing is a gas transit project, really to help with the reverse flow of gas from Slovakia, for example. SIMON: Not so long ago, there was a feeling that if Western Europe, Eastern Europe and Russia were kind of codependent - Russia obviously providing a lot of the energy - that was going to be good, that that would knit a working relationship together on the continent, which had been the source of, obviously, so much suffering. What's happened? CHAKRABARTI: What's happened is clearly a geopolitical mess, currently. And that has affected not just energy, but other fields too - investment levels elsewhere. So you can see, in terms of foreign investment outflows from Russia, they're in very, very heavy this year. The economic linkages were there. They're sort of beginning to break down because of the geopolitical tensions. SIMON: Our reporting from Ukraine says that a lot of people there are stocking up on blankets and batteries. They're concerned about the winter to come. CHAKRABARTI: Yeah, well, I mean, if you look at the economic situation in Ukraine, we're projecting this year that the economy will shrink by 9 percent and next year by another 3 percent. So that has real human consequences. The budget is under extraordinary strain. You can imagine the war, the conflict, in the East and that was where heavy industry was concentrated. That's affected people very badly. SIMON: What can the West do over the next few years before these energy efficiency projects begin to pay off? CHAKRABARTI: Well, I think I'd give an example of what we're trying to do because that's - in a way, says it all really. We really need to ramp up our investment in Ukraine, after really reducing investment in Ukraine over many years because of corruption. But we have a government, which is now tackling corruption, with our help. We have a willingness really, to reform. So we're putting a lot of money into Ukraine really to try and get the economy back on its feet as fast as possible. But it will take two, three years I think before we get positive rates of growth again in Ukraine. SIMON: Suma Chakrabarti is the president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.

And we're not talking about Nessie. This story actually begins in the United States. Years ago, when I was a kid in Portland, Oregon, my brothers and I would go to nearby Fanno Creek. We'd turn over rocks or lower a piece of raw meat on a string into the water. And we'd pull out a crayfish - specifically a North American Signal Crayfish. ALLEN PLEUS: They're important species in our streams and lakes. They are the only native crayfish that we have. SHAPIRO: Allen Pleus is at the Department of Fish and Wildlife in nearby Washington state. He's very familiar with this species of freshwater crustacean. PLEUS: They play well with others. They've learned to be good neighbors with the other native species. SHAPIRO: So I would imagine that raccoons and herons eat them. They eat aquatic insects and larva and everyone lives happily ever after until they get eaten by someone else. PLEUS: That's a good way to say it. Yeah, it's part of that system. SHAPIRO: I never imagined that as an adult, I would find those same creatures wreaking havoc in Scottish waters. MATT MITCHELL: This area is probably - if not the best - certainly one of the best trout fisheries in the world. SHAPIRO: We're standing next to stream called Clyde's Burn. Anglers come from all over the world to fish here. Matt Mitchell has been casting his line into these waters for about 40 years. One day he got call from an angler friend that literally changed his life. MITCHELL: He phoned me and said I think we have a problem. You better come up and look at this. SHAPIRO: Mitchell jumped into the car and headed to the river. MITCHELL: I couldn't believe it myself. I could not believe the number crayfish that were in this part of the river. SHAPIRO: What did you see? MITCHELL: I mean, you can literally walk across the river standing in crayfish. You couldn't walk without standing on a crayfish. They were so numerous. SHAPIRO: These were not just any crayfish. The North American Signal Crayfish were taking over. They had been introduced to English waters decades ago and spread steadily north. And these guys were big. MITCHELL: What we did initially was just hand catch them - hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of them. SHAPIRO: Did you get pinched? MITCHELL: Oh, initially, of course you did. (Laughter) I'm not going to repeat what the language was like. But they were big animals. I mean, some of these things were about 10 inches, 12 inches long. SHAPIRO: That's a lobster. That's not a crayfish, that's a lobster. MITCHELL: That's a big animal. That's an animal that's about, you know, 10, 12 years old. They've been in our rivers for about 12 years we reckon. SHAPIRO: In the United States, we often hear about invasive asiatic carp, zebra mussels, or snakehead fish from China that take over American waterways. Turns out it's a two-way street. American species are causing chaos in other parts of the world too. In Scotland, the North American Signal Crayfish eat the same insects and larva as the prize-winning trout that are native to these streams. MITCHELL: Here's a friend and colleagues of mine, Ian. SHAPIRO: Hi, Ian. I'm Ari. Nice to meet you. Welcome. IAN MILLER: Hi. Hi. SHAPIRO: Ian Miller is the man who placed that you'd better get over here phone call from Clyde's Burn all those years ago. MITCHELL: I would say Ian is the best Clyde angler living at the moment, by far. SHAPIRO: And what kind of changes have you seen with the arrival of the crayfish? MILLER: Stoneflies are gone - basically wiped off the face of the earth. SHAPIRO: And that's an important food for the trout. MILLER: That's an important food. SHAPIRO: No trout food means no trout. The night before we met him, Ian Miller dropped a couple of traps in the water using a dead fish for bait. As we peered over the banks, he pulled the first plastic cage out of the stream. It was alive with crawling, clacking crayfish. MITCHELL: A dozen or more crayfish in it. SHAPIRO: Oh, my God. They're huge. Oh, there's - yeah, there's, like, a dozen of them climbing all over each other. They're beautiful. I mean, they've got these enormous claws. They're dark reddish brown with a hint of blue at the joint of the claw. Crayfish can be a delicacy. But Scotland has decided that encouraging people to eat them would just create a market and make people spread them more widely. So anyone who pulls crayfish out of a Scottish River is legally required to eliminate them. So these now have to be killed having been removed from the river. How will you do that? MITCHELL: Under my boot. SHAPIRO: Really? MITCHELL: That's the quickest and convenient way. SHAPIRO: All right, well, with apologies to any squeamish listeners, let's get the sound of this. I described this scene to Allen Pleus, the naturalist back in the Pacific Northwest. He commiserated with the Scottish anglers. Turns out, Washington state is struggling with a similar problem. PLEUS: Unfortunately, we now have our own invasive crayfish species in this area - mostly Red Swamp Crayfish from the southern United States. SHAPIRO: Wait a minute. I'm doing a story about the North American Signal Crayfish taking over rivers and streams in Scotland. And you're telling me they are being crowded out of rivers and streams in their native habitat by other invasive crayfish that have been brought in from Louisiana? PLEUS: Yes. The native Signal Crayfish - they're considered wimpy in some cases - that they don't put up enough of a fight with these non-native species. SHAPIRO: The serpent eats its tail - or in this case, the crayfish. This is WEEKEND EDITION from NPR News. Rachel Martin is back next week. I'm Ari Shapiro.

Now, this goes back to 1965 when fossil-hunters found a pair of 6-foot-long, heavily clawed arm bones in Mongolia's Gobi Desert. Nobody had seen anything like them before. Scientists say they've now got the rest of the beast, and it looks like dinosaur textbooks will have to be rewritten. Here's NPR's Christopher Joyce. CHRISTOPHER JOYCE, BYLINE: Those two giant arm bones amazed scientists. Some thought the whole beast might have been over a hundred feet long but the arms were all they had. Paleontologists dreamed of finding the rest. PHILIP CURRIE: We've worked in the Gobi for a long time and we were always looking for another one or any indication that there was another one. JOYCE: Philip Currie is a paleontologist at the University of Alberta, and in 2009, his dream came true. Currie was digging in a Mongolian quarry with an international team. Fossil poachers had apparently been there already and taken away dinosaur bones to sell to collectors, but the poachers left a jumble of bones behind. When the team pieced them together, they thought hey, this looks like it might be part of that giant-armed to dinosaur. But the skull, most of the hand bones and the feet were missing. Two years later, Currie got a call from a Belgian scientist. The Belgian said there's a fossil shop here that's got a weird skull, part of a hand and a couple of feet. Currie went to Belgium. CURRIE: And looked at the specimen and sure enough realized that not only is it the same dinosaur but it's, in fact, the same specimen. It's the one that got poached that we took out. JOYCE: Currie confirmed that by comparing the hand bones he had with the ones in Europe, still partially encased in stone. CURRIE: They had the other half of the same palm - same size, same rock color. JOYCE: In fact, the two halves of the palm fit perfectly into the stone matrix in the fossil shop. Currie's team now has the bones from three specimens, which will go back to Mongolia. And scientists now know what those giant arms from 1965 were attached to. MATT CARRANO: It's deeply weird - way weirder than we thought it was. JOYCE: Matt Carrano is curator of dinosaurs at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History. CARRANO: So it's this giant animal. It has, like, a hump on its back. It has a giant head with, like, a duckbill. It's just a very strange thing. JOYCE: Giant meaning 35-feet-long and bulky - over six tons, as big as T. Rex. It walked upright on long legs and, of course, had those 6-foot-long arms out in front. It had a 3-foot-long head and sail-like ridge on its curved back. For the record, it's called Deinocheirus. It's related to a family of dinosaurs that are described as ostrich-like, except this one is way bigger than an ostrich. Paleontologist Tom Holtz at the University of Maryland remembers textbooks that showed those giant arms from 1965. TOM HOLTZ: And now we have this creature, a weird sort of ostrich camel, you know? (Laughter) If it's coming at you, it's going to strike you with a sense of what the heck is that? JOYCE: Holtz says it looks like a dinosaur designed by committee. HOLTZ: There's going to be some kid out there who going to say that this is their favorite dinosaur over-all and that's a kid with a sense of humor. JOYCE: For example, Deinocheirus had stones inside what used to be its gut. Birds and other plant eaters sometimes swallow stones. They're called gastroliths, and they help grind up the plants they eat. But researchers also found bones and scales from fish inside the dinosaur's gut as well, so it probably ate whatever it could gulp down its rather large mouth. The dinosaur is described in the journal, Nature. Dino-scholar Matt Carrano, at the Smithsonian, says there's been a run of previously unknown dinosaurs turning up lately. CARRANO: So that tells me that we have a long way to go before we've found all the dinosaurs there are to find. We should just expect these weirdos to show up pretty regularly. JOYCE: So stay tuned.

Currie's team now has the bones from three specimens, which will go back to Mongolia. And scientists now know what those giant arms from 1965 were attached to. MATT CARRANO: It's deeply weird - way weirder than we thought it was. JOYCE: Matt Carrano is curator of dinosaurs at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History. CARRANO: So it's this giant animal. It has, like, a hump on its back. It has a giant head with, like, a duckbill. It's just a very strange thing. JOYCE: Giant meaning 35-feet-long and bulky - over six tons, as big as T. Rex. It walked upright on long legs and, of course, had those 6-foot-long arms out in front. It had a 3-foot-long head and sail-like ridge on its curved back. For the record, it's called Deinocheirus. It's related to a family of dinosaurs that are described as ostrich-like, except this one is way bigger than an ostrich. Paleontologist Tom Holtz at the University of Maryland remembers textbooks that showed those giant arms from 1965. TOM HOLTZ: And now we have this creature, a weird sort of ostrich camel, you know? (Laughter) If it's coming at you, it's going to strike you with a sense of what the heck is that? JOYCE: Holtz says it looks like a dinosaur designed by committee. HOLTZ: There's going to be some kid out there who going to say that this is their favorite dinosaur over-all and that's a kid with a sense of humor. JOYCE: For example, Deinocheirus had stones inside what used to be its gut. Birds and other plant eaters sometimes swallow stones. They're called gastroliths, and they help grind up the plants they eat. But researchers also found bones and scales from fish inside the dinosaur's gut as well, so it probably ate whatever it could gulp down its rather large mouth. The dinosaur is described in the journal, Nature. Dino-scholar Matt Carrano, at the Smithsonian, says there's been a run of previously unknown dinosaurs turning up lately. CARRANO: So that tells me that we have a long way to go before we've found all the dinosaurs there are to find. We should just expect these weirdos to show up pretty regularly. JOYCE: So stay tuned.

But first. . . DAVID CHRISTIAN: My name is David Christian and since 1989 I've been teaching courses on the history of the universe and the place of humans inside that story, and I call them Big History. RAZ: David Christian is a historian and his idea - Big History - is really about our place in the universe and how small our part of the story actually is. CHRISTIAN: Here you are. You exist around this star. You exist on this planet. You are a member of this species, and all of these are part of knowing what you. And eventually, of course, you'll get to say that you were brought up in Australia or in America. All of those stories we need but we also need this big story. And as long as we don't have this big story, it's going to be very hard, I think, for us to understand ourselves as humans. RAZ: So the story David Christian tells begins 13. 8 billion years ago, pitch black darkness. Here's David on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)CHRISTIAN: Around us there's nothing. There's not even time or space. Imagine the darkest emptiest thing you can and cube it a gazillion times and that's where we are. And then suddenly, bam, a universe appears, an entire universe, and we've crossed our first threshold. The universe is tiny. It's smaller than an atom. It's incredibly hot. It contains everything that's in today's universe. It's busting and it's expanding at incredible speed. And at first, it's just a blur but very quickly distinct things begin to appear in that blur. Within the first second, energy itself shatters into distinct forces, including electromagnetism and gravity. And energy does something else quite magical. It congeals to form matter. Quarks that'll create protons and leptons that include electrons. And all of that happens the first second. Now we move forward 380,000 years. That's twice as long as humans have been on this planet and now simple atoms appeared of hydrogen and helium. Gravity is more powerful where there's more stuff. So where you get slightly denser areas, gravity starts compacting clouds of hydrogen and helium atoms. So we can imagine the early universe breaking up into a billion clouds. And each cloud is compacted. Gravity gets more powerful as density increases. The temperature begins to rise at the center of each cloud and then at the center of each cloud, the temperature crosses the threshold temperature of 10 million degrees. Protons start to fuse. There's a huge release of energy and bam. We have our first stars. From about 200 million years after the Big Bang, stars begin to appear all through the universe - billions of them. And the universe is now significantly more interesting and more complex. RAZ: And all of that wasn't even half a billion years after the Big Bang. It would take another eight or nine billion years for our solar system and our planet to form, and nearly another billion before the first signs of life. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)CHRISTIAN: For most of that time of life on earth, living organisms have been relatively simple single cells but they had great diversity and, inside, great complexity. Then from about 600 to 800 million years ago, multi-cell organisms appear. You get fungi. You get fish. You get plants. You get amphibian. You get reptiles and then, of course, you get the dinosaurs. And occasionally, there are disasters. Sixty-five million years ago, an asteroid landed on earth, near the Yucatan Peninsula, creating conditions equivalent to those of a nuclear war. And the dinosaurs are wiped out. Terrible news for the dinosaurs but great news for our mammalian ancestors who flourished in the niches left empty by the dinosaurs. And we human beings are part of that creative evolutionary pulse that began 65 million years ago with the landing of an asteroid. RAZ: Why do you think we need to know this story? Why do we need to know about our origins? CHRISTIAN: Well, if I were to turn the question around and say why do we need to know about American history, what would the answer be? I think it would be that we need to be able to place our self in a story. Isn't that right? One example of this, one wonderful example about this, is my friend Walter Alverez, the geologist. He's the person who more or less proved that it was an asteroid that wiped out the dinosaurs. Now, if that asteroid had been on a trajectory five minutes earlier or five minutes later, it wouldn't have wiped out the dinosaurs and the dinosaurs would almost certainly still rule the planet and we wouldn't be here. It's as simple as that. So it's a story that, in one sense, makes us feel very small and very little. We inhabit an obscure planet, in an obscure galaxy, around an obscure sun but on the other hand, modern human society represents one of the most complex things we know. And that's the other side of the story. That makes us look pretty interesting. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)CHRISTIAN: Humans appeared about 200,000 years ago. Now, what makes humans different is human language. We are blessed with a language, a system of communication, so powerful and so precise that we can share what we've learned with such precision, that it can accumulate in the collective memory. And that means it can outlast the individuals who learned that information and it can accumulate from generation to generation, and that's why, as a species, we're so creative and so powerful and that's why we have a history. We seem to be the only species in 4 billion years to have this gift. RAZ: I mean, I know sounds like a little bit new-agey but, I mean, it is a mystery. Where we come from is a mystery. We really don't entirely now. CHRISTIAN: Look, it's a wonderful - it is a mystery indeed but, having said that, the astonishing thing is that modern science can open many doors on that mystery - not all of them, there are still doors we can't open. We don't know what to do with consciousness, for example. We don't know what happened before the Big Bang but we can tell a remarkably good story about many parts of that mystery and that story's gotten better and better and better in the last 50 years. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)CHRISTIAN: So I hope you'll agree this is a powerful story and it's a story in which humans play an astonishing and creative role. But it also contains warnings. I remember very vividly as a child, growing up in England living through the Cuban Missile Crisis, for a few days, the entire biosphere seemed to be on the verge of destruction. And the same weapons are still here and they're still armed. If we avoid that trap, others are waiting for us. We're burning fossil fuels at such a rate that we seem to be undermining the Goldilocks conditions that made it possible for human civilizations to flourish over the last 10,000 years. So what big history can do is show us the nature of our complexity and fragility and the dangers that face us but it can also show us our power with collective learning. RAZ: When you think about our origins and you think about this idea of a unified history of the universe, it places, like, our whole very brief history into a context in which I can't help but think, god, not only are we less relevant than we think but we've wasted so much time focusing on ourselves and on our differences when, in fact, we are a tiny piece of this huge story. CHRISTIAN: I agree. I agree and that's one of the reasons why I think this story is so powerful because it makes the differences between humans seem rather irrelevant. So if in schools we keep teaching that history is divided into American history and Chinese history and Russian history and Australian history, we're teaching kids that they are divided into tribes. And we're failing to teach them that we also, as human beings, share problems that we need to work together with. RAZ: David Christian teaches a course called Big History.

I'm Guy Raz. A couple weeks ago, I got a small package in the mail, and inside there was a kit.

You probably had a favorite dinosaur right? UNIDENTIFIED BOY #1: My favorite dinosaur is a T-Rex. UNIDENTIFIED GIRL #1: T-Rex. UNIDENTIFIED BOY #2: It's probably a T-Rex. RAZ: We tried this question out on some kids at the Smithsonian Natural History Museum here in Washington, D. C. , and we found some striking uniformity. RAZ: What's your favorite dinosaur?

(SOUNDS OF CHILDREN IMITATING T-REX NOISE)RAZ: So what is it about these creatures, who lived so long before we did, that speaks to us about our own origins? JACK HORNER: They're gone, and they're very different from anything alive today. RAZ: This is Jack Horner. HORNER: I'm the curator of paleontology at the Museum of the Rockies in Bozeman, Montana. RAZ: Jack Horner is like other scientists who are trying to piece together parts of our past. Some of them simulate the Big Bang inside massive particle colliders; others look deep into space through giant telescopes to see the past. And in Jack's case, he's also on a quest to bring some of that distant past, literally back to life. And it all started with, \"Jurassic Park. \"HORNER: The Tyrannosaurus Rex they made in the first movie was just incredibly real looking. RAZ: Jack was and advisor on the film and he was even the inspiration for one of the main characters. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"JURASSIC PARK\")SAM NEILL: (As Dr. Alan Grant) Keep absolutely still. RAZ: Dr. Alan Grant. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"JURASSIC PARK\")NEILL: (As Dr. Alan Grant) It's vision's based on movement. HORNER: I guess the fortunate thing about that is that he didn't get eaten. RAZ: (Laughter) And it was seeing the T-Rex so lifelike on the big screen that reignited something in Jack. HORNER: It was one of the things that sparked my interest in actually trying to make a dinosaur. RAZ: Just like in the movie, Jack Horner wants to make a real-life dinosaur, but one a little friendlier than the T-Rex, one he says you could actually can have as a pet. What kind of pet dinosaur would you have? HORNER: Why I'd have a chickenosaurus. RAZ: A chickenosaurus. Actually it's not that different from what Jack's characters did in, \"Jurassic Park. \"(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"JURASSIC PARK\")NEILL: (As Dr. Alan Grant) Well, maybe dinosaurs have more in common with present-day birds than they do with reptiles. RAZ: In this scene, Dr. Alan Grant is examining a Velociraptor fossil. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"JURASSIC PARK\")NEILL: (As Dr. Alan Grant)  Look at the pubic bone. It turns backward just like a bird. Look at the vertebrate, full of air-sacks and hollows just like a bird. And even the word raptor means bird of prey. RAZ: And even if we can't make a dinosaur like they did in, \"Jurassic Park,\" could a bird, could a chicken get us closer? Here's Jack Horner big idea from the Ted stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)HORNER: The theme of this story is building a dinosaur and so we come to that part of, \"Jurassic Park. \" This is, you know, Michael Crichton really was one of the first people to talk about bringing dinosaurs back to life. If you want dinosaur DNA, I say, go to the dinosaur. Back in 1993, when the movie came out we actually had a grant from the National Science Foundation to attempt to extract DNA from a dinosaur. But we have discovered that dinosaur DNA and all DNA just breaks down too fast. We're just not going to be able to do what they did in, \"Jurassic Park. \" We're not going to be able to make a dinosaur based on a dinosaur. But birds are dinosaurs. Birds are living dinosaurs. So we don't have to make a dinosaur, 'cause we already have them. (LAUGHTER)HORNER: I know, you're as bad as the sixth graders, right? (LAUGHTER)HORNER: The sixth graders look at it and they say, no. You can call it a dinosaur, but look at the Velociraptor, the Velociraptor is. . . (LAUGHTER)HORNER: Fix the chicken. So we have a number of ways that we actually can, fix, the chicken. We'll call them biological modification tools. We have selection and we know selection works, right? I mean, we started out with a wolf-like creature, and we end up with a Maltese. I mean, that's definitely genetic modification. We also have transgenesis. Transgenesis is really cool, too. That's where you take a gene out of one animal and stick it in another one. You know, that's how people make Glofish. You take gene - a glow gene out of a coral or jellyfish and stick it in a zebrafish, and they glow. And I guess we could make a glow chicken. But I don't think that will satisfy the sixth-graders either. RAZ: Jack's solution is to focus on something buried deep in the origin of the chicken. For instance, every chicken, while it is still an embryo, actually has a three-fingered hand. But at some point a gene switches on and the triggers. . . HORNER: The fusion of the hand and so there are genes that have fused the fingers together basically to form the wing. RAZ: The idea is that if scientist could figure out a way to stop those genes from activating. . . (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)HORNER: We can get a chicken that hatches out with a three-fingered hand, and the same goes for the tails. We know that in embryo, as the animal is developing, it actually has a relatively long tail. But a gene turns on and resorbs the tail, gets rid of it. So that's the other gene we're looking for. We want to stop that tail from resorbing. So what we're trying to do really is take our chicken, modify it and make a chickenosaurus. (LAUGHTER)HORNER: You can just imagine a chicken, if it had a long, bony tail and a three-fingered hand instead of wings, it would be a long ways to looking like a Velociraptor even then. RAZ: Wow, Jack, you are freaking me out a little bit. HORNER: You know, when I explain this sort of thing to people and people do get kind of weirded-out, I try to take them back to dogs, for example, you know, with a Chihuahua. They've basically bred for an animal that looks like the embryonic wolf. And so if you can be happy with that, I surely don't understand why a bird with a tail is going to freak anybody out. RAZ: Oh, don't get me wrong, I will be the first in line to see the chickenosaurus. HORNER: Well, we're working on it. RAZ: Now even though a living, breathing chickenosaurus is still a long way off, Jack says even just the idea of one is still one way to get kids closer to our collective past. HORNER: Absolutely. And it also, you know, teaches them about evolution. And one of the cool things, I think about dinosaurs, is it allows, you know, kids get interested. And they just soak up all this information about dinosaurs, and early on they know more than their parents. And so they really fuel the imagination of kids. And even as a paleontologist, I imagine them fighting. I imagine them roaming around. They still fuel my imagination. RAZ: When you think about the time periods that we're talking about, you know, such a long period of time has passed since then. Does studying dinosaurs kind of put, you know, the human era into perspective for you as almost like a kind a blip in time? HORNER: Well, let me give you a different perspective, just, you know, take any group of dinosaurs, like horn dinosaurs, the amount of time that horn dinosaurs were on Earth and the amount of time they had to evolve was greater than the period of time since they've gone extinct to now. RAZ: Wow. HORNER: So trying to put the blimp of time into perspective, I mean, we have had zero time as far as humans go. RAZ: Jack Horner, his TED Talk is at ted. npr. org. By the way, he's also advising the filmmakers behind next year's \"Jurassic Park 4. \"HORNER: I've been on the set. RAZ: So can you tell us, you know, tell a little bit? HORNER: Well, I can't tell you. RAZ: We won't tell, we won't tell anybody. HORNER: It's a great story, and it's got a really, really scary new dinosaur. RAZ: Aw, what kind? HORNER: I can't tell you. RAZ: Does it have feathers? HORNER: Nope, doesn't have feathers. RAZ: Does it have really sharp teeth? HORNER: Yes it does. GUY RAZ, HOST:   It's the TED Radio Hour from NPR. I'm Guy Raz. And our show today, How It All Began, ideas about our origins and the things that came before us. So think back to your own recent origins, when you were a kid. You probably had a favorite dinosaur right? UNIDENTIFIED BOY #1: My favorite dinosaur is a T-Rex. UNIDENTIFIED GIRL #1: T-Rex. UNIDENTIFIED BOY #2: It's probably a T-Rex. RAZ: We tried this question out on some kids at the Smithsonian Natural History Museum here in Washington, D. C. , and we found some striking uniformity. RAZ: What's your favorite dinosaur? UNIDENTIFIED BOY # 3: T-Rex. UNIDENTIFIED GIRL #3: A T-Rex. UNIDENTIFIED GIRL #4: A T-Rex. RAZ: A T-Rex again. These kids were between 5 and 12, and when you tried to pin them down on why, why the T-Rex is their favorite. . . UNIDENTIFIED GIRL #4: Because. . . RAZ: . . . Well. . . UNIDENTIFIED GIRL # 4: It's the king and. . . UNIDENTIFIED BOY #4: The T-Rex's teeth are as big as a banana. UNIDENTIFIED GIRL #4: It's like eating bones and people and stuff. UNIDENTIFIED BOY # 5: It's kind of like my dream monster if you think about it. UNIDENTIFIED GIRL # 4: Because it's scary and big. RAZ: What is the sound that a T-Rex makes? (SOUNDS OF CHILDREN IMITATING T-REX NOISE) RAZ: So what is it about these creatures, who lived so long before we did, that speaks to us about our own origins? JACK HORNER: They're gone, and they're very different from anything alive today. RAZ: This is Jack Horner. HORNER: I'm the curator of paleontology at the Museum of the Rockies in Bozeman, Montana. RAZ: Jack Horner is like other scientists who are trying to piece together parts of our past. Some of them simulate the Big Bang inside massive particle colliders; others look deep into space through giant telescopes to see the past. And in Jack's case, he's also on a quest to bring some of that distant past, literally back to life. And it all started with, \"Jurassic Park. \" HORNER: The Tyrannosaurus Rex they made in the first movie was just incredibly real looking. RAZ: Jack was and advisor on the film and he was even the inspiration for one of the main characters. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"JURASSIC PARK\") SAM NEILL: (As Dr. Alan Grant) Keep absolutely still. RAZ: Dr. Alan Grant. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"JURASSIC PARK\") NEILL: (As Dr. Alan Grant) It's vision's based on movement. HORNER: I guess the fortunate thing about that is that he didn't get eaten. RAZ: (Laughter) And it was seeing the T-Rex so lifelike on the big screen that reignited something in Jack. HORNER: It was one of the things that sparked my interest in actually trying to make a dinosaur. RAZ: Just like in the movie, Jack Horner wants to make a real-life dinosaur, but one a little friendlier than the T-Rex, one he says you could actually can have as a pet. What kind of pet dinosaur would you have? HORNER: Why I'd have a chickenosaurus. RAZ: A chickenosaurus. Actually it's not that different from what Jack's characters did in, \"Jurassic Park. \" (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"JURASSIC PARK\") NEILL: (As Dr. Alan Grant) Well, maybe dinosaurs have more in common with present-day birds than they do with reptiles. RAZ: In this scene, Dr. Alan Grant is examining a Velociraptor fossil. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"JURASSIC PARK\") NEILL: (As Dr. Alan Grant)  Look at the pubic bone. It turns backward just like a bird. Look at the vertebrate, full of air-sacks and hollows just like a bird. And even the word raptor means bird of prey. RAZ: And even if we can't make a dinosaur like they did in, \"Jurassic Park,\" could a bird, could a chicken get us closer? Here's Jack Horner big idea from the Ted stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) HORNER: The theme of this story is building a dinosaur and so we come to that part of, \"Jurassic Park. \" This is, you know, Michael Crichton really was one of the first people to talk about bringing dinosaurs back to life. If you want dinosaur DNA, I say, go to the dinosaur. Back in 1993, when the movie came out we actually had a grant from the National Science Foundation to attempt to extract DNA from a dinosaur. But we have discovered that dinosaur DNA and all DNA just breaks down too fast. We're just not going to be able to do what they did in, \"Jurassic Park. \" We're not going to be able to make a dinosaur based on a dinosaur. But birds are dinosaurs. Birds are living dinosaurs. So we don't have to make a dinosaur, 'cause we already have them. (LAUGHTER) HORNER: I know, you're as bad as the sixth graders, right? (LAUGHTER) HORNER: The sixth graders look at it and they say, no. You can call it a dinosaur, but look at the Velociraptor, the Velociraptor is. . . (LAUGHTER) HORNER: Fix the chicken. So we have a number of ways that we actually can, fix, the chicken. We'll call them biological modification tools. We have selection and we know selection works, right? I mean, we started out with a wolf-like creature, and we end up with a Maltese. I mean, that's definitely genetic modification. We also have transgenesis. Transgenesis is really cool, too. That's where you take a gene out of one animal and stick it in another one. You know, that's how people make Glofish. You take gene - a glow gene out of a coral or jellyfish and stick it in a zebrafish, and they glow. And I guess we could make a glow chicken. But I don't think that will satisfy the sixth-graders either. RAZ: Jack's solution is to focus on something buried deep in the origin of the chicken. For instance, every chicken, while it is still an embryo, actually has a three-fingered hand. But at some point a gene switches on and the triggers. . . HORNER: The fusion of the hand and so there are genes that have fused the fingers together basically to form the wing. RAZ: The idea is that if scientist could figure out a way to stop those genes from activating. . . (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) HORNER: We can get a chicken that hatches out with a three-fingered hand, and the same goes for the tails. We know that in embryo, as the animal is developing, it actually has a relatively long tail. But a gene turns on and resorbs the tail, gets rid of it. So that's the other gene we're looking for. We want to stop that tail from resorbing. So what we're trying to do really is take our chicken, modify it and make a chickenosaurus. (LAUGHTER) HORNER: You can just imagine a chicken, if it had a long, bony tail and a three-fingered hand instead of wings, it would be a long ways to looking like a Velociraptor even then. RAZ: Wow, Jack, you are freaking me out a little bit. HORNER: You know, when I explain this sort of thing to people and people do get kind of weirded-out, I try to take them back to dogs, for example, you know, with a Chihuahua. They've basically bred for an animal that looks like the embryonic wolf. And so if you can be happy with that, I surely don't understand why a bird with a tail is going to freak anybody out.

I'm Guy Raz. And our show today - how it all began, ideas about our origins. So if you'd been hanging out in, say, the town of Whitehorse, which is in Canada's Yukon Territory, this past week, this is what you'd have heard on the radio. (SOUNDBITE OF RADIO SHOW)UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER: On 96. 1 The Rush. MARJ: Hi, I'm Marj. And this is Marj's Market. Tired of paying rent? There are alternatives. RAZ: And around the same time, around 6,000 miles to the Southeast, you would've heard this in Peru. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: (Spanish spoken). UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: (Spanish spoken). UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: (Spanish spoken). RAZ: About 8,000 miles Northeast, this was on the air in St. Petersburg, Russia. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #3: (Russian spoken). RAZ: And more than 3,000 miles South, this in Kenya. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #4: (Foreign language spoken). RAZ: So earlier in the show, David Christian explained that it was language that gave us an edge as a species. More than 6,000 languages are spoken around the world, so how did that happen? How did we come to look and sound so different? That's what Spencer Wells has been trying to figure out. SPENCER WELLS: I mean, I spend my life traveling visiting places like Chad and Tajikistan and Papua New Guinea and Palau. RAZ: Spencer Wells, you might remember, is the geneticist who analyzed my DNA earlier in the show. He's also an explorer for National Geographic. And he told us that one of the things he really likes to do when he travels is to look at faces. WELLS: You know, you see people who seem to be so different from each other. And kind of the underlying theme of our work is, well, how different are they really? RAZ: Turns out, not much. And while Louise Leakey and her family proved that through prehistoric bones and fossils, Spencer Wells looks for the evidence of our common origins in living, breathing human beings. He's using the tools of molecular genetics to figure out when human populations began to migrate from Africa and spread across the globe. More on that in a minute. But first, let's go back to the beginning. So we are about 200,000 years old, right? WELLS: Approximately. Based on fossil records, yeah. RAZ: Like the way the human - the way humans are. WELLS: Things that we would recognize as being like us if they were sitting here in the studio. RAZ: 200,000 years ago, where are we living and what do we sort of look like? WELLS: We were living as a very small group of hunter-gatherers out in savannas of likely Eastern Africa, so present-day Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania. And it was in that kind of crucible of East African hunter-gatherer society that all of the modern human characteristics arose. RAZ: So 200,000 years ago, we're all dark. Our skin is darker, right? WELLS: Yeah, we're a species of hairless primate. And we evolved in the tropics. And there was no SPF 50 200,000 years ago. RAZ: Yeah. WELLS: So we had to have some sort of natural sunscreen, and that was melanin. RAZ: It's amazing to think about the age of our universe. 200,000 years is nothing. That's like a blimp in time. It's like it's not even a second on the 24-hour clock. WELLS: Exactly. RAZ: And yet we have. . . WELLS: It's a few thousand human generations. RAZ: Yeah. So we're talking about a huge change in the way we look in such a short period of time. WELLS: Absolutely. So why? RAZ: Yeah, why? WELLS: That's one of the big unsolved mysteries. We know that there's been adaptation. So we started off dark living in the tropics in Africa. And my ancestors, for instance, who came from northern Europe. . . RAZ: You're a very white guy, you know. WELLS: My buddy, Skip Gates, who does all of the PBS shows on African-American lives and so on, is filming with me once. And he says, Spencer, you know it takes the whitest man in the world to tell us we all came from black Africans. (LAUGHTER)RAZ: Spencer Wells picks up the story from the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)WELLS: And how recently do we share this ancestry? Was it millions of years ago? - which we might suspect by looking at all this incredible variation around the world. No. The DNA tells a story that's very clear. Within the last 200,000 years, we all share an ancestor - a single person, mitochondrial Eve; you might have heard about her - in Africa. An African woman who gave rise to all the mitochondrial diversity in the world today. But what's even more amazing is that if you look at the Y-chromosome side, the male side of the story, the Y-chromosome Adam only lived around 60,000 years ago. That's only about 2,000 human generations - the blink of an eye in an evolutionary sense. That tells us we were all still living in Africa at that time. This was an African man who gave rise to all the Y-chromosome diversity around the world. It's only within the last 60,000 years that we have started to generate this incredible diversity we see around the world. Such an amazing story. We're all effectively part of an extended African family. RAZ: And what happens? When do they - how do they start to move out? And where do they go? WELLS: Well, so the evidence is that there might've been a little brief foray into the Middle East, in the Arabian Peninsula, as early as 120,000 years ago. But they didn't go very far beyond that. But the big blast came out around 60,000 years ago. So that's 2,000 human generations. RAZ: So the question of course is what happened? Why didn't humans start to leave Africa earlier than that? (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)WELLS: Well, that's a big question - these why questions, particularly in genetics and the study of history. When all else fails, talk about the weather. What was going on to the world's weather around 60,000 years ago? Well, we were going into the worst part of the last ice age. The Northern Hemisphere had massive, growing ice sheets. New York City, Chicago, Seattle - all under a sheet of ice. Most of Britain, all of Scandinavia - covered by ice several kilometers thick. Now Africa is most tropical continent. We weren't covered in ice in Africa, rather Africa was drying out at that time. The reason for that is that ice actually sucks moisture out of the atmosphere. If you think about Antarctica, it's technically a desert. And Africa was turning to desert. The Sahara was much bigger then than it is now. And the human habitat was reduced to just a few small pockets compared to what we have today. The evidence from genetic data is that the human population around this time - roughly 70,000 years ago -crashed to fewer than 2,000 individuals. We nearly went extinct. We were hanging on by our fingernails. RAZ: We were almost completely wiped out as a species. And if that wasn't bad enough. . . WELLS: We had the eruption of a mega-volcano, the largest volcanic eruption in the last 20 to 30 million years - Mount Toba in Sumatra, which today is Lake Toba. And it blew its top, and it spewed all of this ash into the atmosphere and sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere. And this had the effect of creating a global nuclear winter, in effect. And temperatures dropped by 15 or 20 degrees Celsius, on average. RAZ: Wow. It just blocked the sun. WELLS: Yeah. It blocked out the sun, basically. And so the animals and the plants become sparser, and so the human population becomes sparser. We can also look at the genetic variation that we see today. And humans have remarkably little genetic variation for a species of large ape. We're highly inbred. And it's because the population size around the time of that volcanic eruption dropped down to maybe as few as 2,000. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)WELLS: But then, 50, 60, 70,000 years ago, somewhere in that region, all hell breaks loose. Art makes its appearance. The stone tools become much more finely crafted. The evidence is that human began to specialize in particular prey species at particular times of the year. The population size started to expand. Probably, according to what many linguists believe, fully modern language - syntactic language, subject, verb, object that we use to convey complex ideas, like I'm doing now - appeared around that time. We became much more social. The social networks expanded. This change in behavior allowed us to survive these worsening conditions in Africa. And they allowed us to start to expand around the world. RAZ: What do we imagine that that migration was like? WELLS: Well, I think it was really just a question of people moving a little bit further in search of better food supplies or water supplies. There might have some wanderlust involved. RAZ: So it wasn't like, hey, let's go, you know, 10,000 miles? It was a very slow migration over thousands and thousands. . . WELLS: Well, every long journey starts with a step. And in this case, people had no idea what was out there. I mean, there was nobody tweeting from Siberia saying, hey, guys, come on up here. There's lots of, you know, reindeer up here on the tundra. They didn't know what they were going to encounter. I mean, it's really amazing if you think about. You're setting off on the biggest journey in the history of your species. You have no idea where you're going, but you are smart enough to be able to figure out solutions to all the problems that are going to be thrown in your way. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)WELLS: The reason you're alive today is because of those changes in our brains that took place in Africa around 60, 70,000 years ago, allowing us not only to survive in Africa but to expand out of Africa. An early coastal migration along the south coast of Asia, leaving Africa around 60,000 years ago, reaching Australia very rapidly by 50,000 years ago. Slightly later migration up into the Middle East. These would have been savanna hunters. Entering Europe around 35,000 years ago. And finally, a small group migrating up through the worst weather imaginable - Siberia, inside the Arctic Circle during the last Ice Age - temperatures of -70, -80, even -100, perhaps - migrating into the Americas, ultimately reaching that final frontier. An amazing story. And it happened first in Africa. The changes that allowed us to do that. The evolution of this highly adaptable brain that we all carry around with us, allowing us to create novel cultures. Allowing us to develop the diversity that we see on a whirlwind trip like the one I've just been on. Thank you very much.

Probably, according to what many linguists believe, fully modern language - syntactic language, subject, verb, object that we use to convey complex ideas, like I'm doing now - appeared around that time. We became much more social. The social networks expanded. This change in behavior allowed us to survive these worsening conditions in Africa. And they allowed us to start to expand around the world. RAZ: What do we imagine that that migration was like? WELLS: Well, I think it was really just a question of people moving a little bit further in search of better food supplies or water supplies. There might have some wanderlust involved. RAZ: So it wasn't like, hey, let's go, you know, 10,000 miles? It was a very slow migration over thousands and thousands. . . WELLS: Well, every long journey starts with a step. And in this case, people had no idea what was out there. I mean, there was nobody tweeting from Siberia saying, hey, guys, come on up here. There's lots of, you know, reindeer up here on the tundra. They didn't know what they were going to encounter. I mean, it's really amazing if you think about. You're setting off on the biggest journey in the history of your species. You have no idea where you're going, but you are smart enough to be able to figure out solutions to all the problems that are going to be thrown in your way. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) WELLS: The reason you're alive today is because of those changes in our brains that took place in Africa around 60, 70,000 years ago, allowing us not only to survive in Africa but to expand out of Africa. An early coastal migration along the south coast of Asia, leaving Africa around 60,000 years ago, reaching Australia very rapidly by 50,000 years ago. Slightly later migration up into the Middle East. These would have been savanna hunters. Entering Europe around 35,000 years ago. And finally, a small group migrating up through the worst weather imaginable - Siberia, inside the Arctic Circle during the last Ice Age - temperatures of -70, -80, even -100, perhaps - migrating into the Americas, ultimately reaching that final frontier. An amazing story. And it happened first in Africa. The changes that allowed us to do that. The evolution of this highly adaptable brain that we all carry around with us, allowing us to create novel cultures. Allowing us to develop the diversity that we see on a whirlwind trip like the one I've just been on. Thank you very much.

But what about where we're going and what we're evolving into? So, Juan, the last time we spoke, you said that we are going to become yet another hominid or set of hominids. We're going to evolve into something different. Do you still think that? Is that still your view? JUAN ENRIQUEZ: I think it's becoming increasingly likely that we'll become various species. RAZ: This is futurist Juan Enriquez. ENRIQUEZ: And what is making it increasingly likely these days is two things. One is new genetic technologies that allow you to alter gene code in a basic way. And the second is space travel, which will create a need for various kinds of bodies that haven't evolved to survive radiation or different gravity or different structures. RAZ: Juan was on the show back in 2014, and since then, a lot has changed with gene-editing technology and what Juan calls the life code revolution. ENRIQUEZ: It's moving so quickly. So within the last 60 days, one of the things that we've seen is new research coming out that allows you to change not just blocks of genes but individual letters in the gene code. And so the pinpoint accuracy of being able to do that means that the likelihood of side effects are much lower, and the effectiveness is much higher. Now, why would you want to do this? Well, one of the things about traveling in space is because you don't have the atmosphere, you're far more exposed to radiation. RAZ: Right. ENRIQUEZ: And we know there's some bugs, some plants, some animals that are far more sensitive to radiation than others are. And in the measure that you understand why some creatures are more or less vulnerable to radiation, it may be possible to engineer a human genome, almost like you do with a vaccine, in such a way that we become far more radiation-resistant. RAZ: Which would allow us to live on Mars. ENRIQUEZ: Which would allow us to live in a very different atmosphere, which would allow us to travel much longer distances across space without coming down with terrible cancers, which may make it possible even to get to another solar system. RAZ: I mean, when that happens - right? - what will we even look like? Like, if we go back 300,000 years - right? - humans looked more or less the same, right? Like, we would recognize them today. But in this future that you're describing, if we're still around, what would we look like? Like, what parts of us would we potentially not need? ENRIQUEZ: So if you lose an arm or if you lose a leg, you're still you. If you have a kidney transplant, you're still you. If you lose your brain, then you're not you. Then, you know, your fundamental humanity has left. RAZ: Right. ENRIQUEZ: And so I think people tend to focus a lot on what the body would look like. And that's an interesting question. But that's not the core question. The core question is, how are our brains going to evolve? Our brains are 2 percent of our body weight and about 20 percent of our energy consumption. And I suspect what's going to happen is, as we're faced with more and more challenges and questions, one, our brains are likely to get larger. They will consume more energy, which will probably start melding, communicating, coprocessing with other brains and probably creating a symbiotic relationship with machines. RAZ: Wow. But what about, like, the rest of us? What about the rest of our bodies? ENRIQUEZ: What's probably going to happen is we're going to start remaking each of our body parts as they wear out. And the limiting factor, then, to how long people live is not going to be your body parts because it's going to be, like, your old house. You know, you redo the kitchen. You redo the bathroom. You swap out the oven. You put in a new fridge. Well, that's what's going to happen to our bodies with our body parts. And then the limiting factor's the brain because we're a long way from understanding the brain. We're a long way from being able to map the brain. We're a long way from being able to reproduce the brain. And we're a long way from being able to download memories from one brain to another. But if you do that, then all bets are off as to how long a human being could live. RAZ: Wow. You know, one of the questions that I've asked futurists a lot over the years and something that I think about in this episode is whether we will be around in a thousand years or even 500 years. And if you want to know my answer, I think there will be humans on the planet in 500 years but far fewer. And I think it sounds dark and pessimistic. But I can't imagine a world in 500 years where humans are thriving and growing. What do you think? I mean, do you think that we will be thriving in 500 years on planet Earth? ENRIQUEZ: You know, I tend to agree with you on most things. This one, I don't agree with you on. I. . . RAZ: Great. That's good. I don't want you to. . . ENRIQUEZ: (Laughter). RAZ: . . . Cause I don't want that future. ENRIQUEZ: No, I mean, look. One of the things I love to ask audiences is if, you know, we had a way of safely putting you into a deep sleep for 300 years and you got a chance to wake up and see what's happened in 300 years, would you do it? And I would love to see what's here in 300 years. I think there's never been a better time to be alive than today. There's a whole lot of problems in the world today, and we have to recognize those. But boy, compared to a hundred years ago, 500 years ago, a thousand years ago, things have gotten mostly better in most places. And 300 years from now, I think our great-great-grandkids are going to be doing stuff that's unimaginable in terms of how they've dealt with violence, how they have created a more peaceful, prosperous world, in terms of how they've gotten out into space. I would love to see what happens in 300 years. RAZ: That's Juan Enriquez.

So how do you explain it? LOUISE LEAKEY: I like to use a roll of toilet paper. RAZ: And by the way, this is the renowned paleontologist Louise Leakey. LEAKEY: So if you lay out a toilet roll which is 400 sheets in length and you actually think about where the dinosaurs, which everybody's familiar with, comes in on the nineteenth sheet from the end, they go extinct on the fifth sheet from the end, they're around for 14 or so sheets of that toilet roll. At that point, it gave rise to the mammals. And our species, Homo sapiens, only came into being in that very last millimeter of that last sheet, the last 200,000 years. RAZ: A millimeter of the four-hundredth sheet on a roll of toilet paper, that's the whole history of our species. And until very recently, we didn't even know that much and what we do know about our origins is thanks, in large part, to Louise Leakey's family. Their story in Africa all started with her great-grandparents. They were missionaries who settled in Kenya's Kikuyu highlands. LEAKEY: And that's where Louis, my grandfather, was born and he really grew up speaking Kikuyu and Swahili and collecting snakes and animals, and finding small little obsidian flakes as a child, which I think really instilled within him a sense of excitement. And I think that really sowed the seed, he was convinced he was going to find the answers to our past in Africa rather than outside of Africa, which is what the conventional thinking was at that time. RAZ: OK so bit of explanation here - up until really the late 1940s, most serious paleontologists believed in something called the Out of Asia Theory and it basically argued that our species developed in Asia and the fossil record at the time seemed to confirm it. But Louis Leakey was an outlier, he was absolutely convinced that humans came from Africa and he became obsessed with proving it, even though most self-respecting fossil hunters were digging in Asia. LEAKEY: They had finds from Indonesia, from China and to have imagined that you could've found fossils in Africa didn't seem right. What they didn't know was the fossils that were found outside of Africa were all much younger than the fossils that they would then go on to find in Africa so of course, the conventional thinking was that Louis was looking in quite the wrong place. RAZ: But Louis Leakey and his wife Mary persisted, they spent decades digging for clues in Tanzania in a remote area known as Olduvai Gorge. (SOUNDBITE OF DOCUMENTARY BY NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC)LOUIS LEAKEY: Olduvai Gorge gives us one of the most remarkable stories of the past, the last chapter of the Earth's history, starting from the present day right away back to two million years. RAZ: This is Louis Leakey from an old National Geographic documentary and it was at Olduvai Gorge where the Leakey's would upend the entire field of paleoanthropology in 1959. LEAKEY: When my grandmother Mary found the skull of Zinjanthropus. RAZ: Now, the skull of Zinjanthropus was one of the most significant hominid fossils found up to that point. It was 1. 75 million years old, far older than other fossils found in China and Indonesia and it proved that our ancestors came from and evolved in Africa. LEAKEY: So that find really put then Africa on the map and made people then turn to Africa. RAZ: It changed our entire understanding of where we came from and that find launched a family dynasty of paleontologists - their sons Richard and Jonathan, and eventually their granddaughter Louise, who explained her ideas on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)LEAKEY: Who are we? That is the big question. And essentially, we are just an upright, walking, big brain, super intelligent ape. We belong to the family called the Hominidae. We are the species called Homo sapiens sapiens. We are one species of about 5 and half-thousand mammalian species that exist on planet Earth today and that's just a tiny fraction of all species that have ever lived on the planet in past times. We're one species out of approximately - let's say at least 16 - upright walking apes that have existed over the past 6 to 8 million years, but as far as we know we're the only upright walking ape that exists on planet Earth today. And it's important to remember that and in terms of our place in the world today and our future on planet Earth. In fact, if you go back in time it is the norm that there are multiple species of Hominids or of human ancestors that coexist at any one time. We've only been around for the past 200,000 years as a species, yet we've reached a population of more than 6-and-a-half billion people. But what's happened is, our technology has removed the checks and balances on our population growth. My father so appropriately put it that we are certainly the only animal that makes conscious choices that are bad for our survival as a species. Can we hold it together? It's important to remember that we all evolved in Africa, we all have an African origin. We have a common past and we share a common future. Evolutionarily speaking, we are just a blip. We're sitting on the edge of a precipice. We have the tools and the technology at our hands to communicate what needs to be done to hold it together, today. Will we do that, or will we just let nature take its course? RAZ: In a sense, what you do by looking into the past is almost like a window into the future. LEAKEY: Well, that's absolutely right. I think when you work on fossils and you realize that a species is there and it's abundant for quite a long period of time and then at some point it's no longer there - and so when you look at that bigger picture, yes, you realize that either you change and adapt, or as a species, you go extinct. RAZ: I mean, you think about Neanderthals who lasted for half-a-million years, right and we've been around for 200,000. I mean, let's just talk about 5,000 years from now. I mean, do you think it's likely that we will be here in 5,000 years? LEAKEY: I couldn't answer that question. I really, I stop and think about it quite often. As a species yes, we probably could be here, but in what numbers and possibly far fewer, if we're really going to sustain ourselves on the planet. But every species becomes extinct, at some point we will go extinct. The question is, as Homo sapiens, are we going to be able to adapt to the change that we're actually part of? We're causing such dramatic changes to the planet so yes, you do stop and think, I wonder where we're headed. RAZ: Louise Leakey is a third-generation paleontologist from the legendary Leakey family.

He was left in a state known as locked-in syndrome - paralyzed physically, but mentally aware. He was only able to move his left eyelid and used it to dictate his memoir, \"The Diving Bell And The Butterfly. \"Now we turn to a story about a patient who was left in a similar state, but learned to communicate with brain waves. In 2009, Barry Beck, a geologist in his 60s, had a series of strokes. They caused extensive damage to his right occipital lobe and to the brainstem. ERIC SELLERS: According to the neurologist and the MRI scans, he had one of the worst cases of locked-in syndrome that they had seen. RATH: That's Eric Sellers, a professor at East Tennessee State University. He and his team started working with Beck 10 months after his stroke. SELLERS: When I first saw him, he had a little bit of eye movement, and that was really the only way that he could communicate. RATH: Beck's wife contacted Sellers when she heard about the research he was doing. Sellers runs the Brain-Computer Interface Laboratory, where he focuses on helping people with severe motor disabilities to communicate. He and his team were working on a system to connect brain waves and computers to make a virtual keyboard. SELLERS: It's basically instead of using your hands to press keys on the keyboard, you're using brain waves to press the keys. RATH: To use the system, you would wear a noninvasive electrode cap and sit in front of a monitor that has a picture of a keyboard. At random, groups of letters flash. SELLERS: And if you want to choose the A, you pay attention to the A. And then every time the A flashes, your brain produces this response. It's called a P300. And this P300 is like an aha response. So your brain kind of says, aha, that's the one I want to select. RATH: The technology has been used to help people with Lou Gehrig's Disease compose messages. It's also allowed people to control wheelchairs and prosthetic limbs just by thinking. But Barry Beck was one of the first patients with a severe brainstem injury to use it successfully. Eric Sellers and his team started slow, with just four letters - Y for yes, N for no, P for pass and E for end. SELLERS: The first major action we had was a 25-question dialogue that ended up in us determining that he wanted more information regarding his prognosis. RATH: Once they knew he was able to use it, they fine-tuned the settings and eventually presented him with a full alphabet so he could spell out words. Barry Beck could now communicate. SELLERS: One of the first messages that he spelled was to his wife. He spelled out thank you for all of your hard work. He, on a couple of occasions, also asked me to make the system go faster. (Laughter) And I, of course, told him that I was trying. I'm doing my best. (Laughter). RATH: That's because the system is slow - very slow. It took Beck 38 seconds to select each character. Much of Seller's research was focused on making the machine faster and more accurate. But for Beck the painstaking task was worth it. SELLERS: It was also something that gave his wife a lot of satisfaction - knowing that he was actually, you know, still in there and, for the most part, cognitively intact. His kids would visit while used the BCI, and so it had a really large effect on the family, as well. RATH: Sellers and his team worked with Beck for more than a year, conducting therapy sessions in the nursing home where he lived. In November of 2011, at the age of 67, Barry Beck died. But Sellers says that through his participation, Barry Beck played a part in making this technology more accessible to other locked-in patients. SELLERS: For the people that are participating in our research program, they understand they may not benefit from this technology, but they also realize how important it could be for people who are in similar situations. RATH: Sellers imagines a future where this technology is available in hospitals. SELLERS: If someone has some type of injury - automobile accident or something like that - and they have to be intubated and on a respirator, you could imagine that emergency rooms, trauma wards would actually have these.

Texas Public Radio's Eileen Pace reports. EILEEN PACE, BYLINE: Down a narrow gravel drive and a short walk past the cactus and scrub seeders is a gaping dark mouth, 60-feet wide, nestled at the bottom of a steep hill. This is the Bracken Bat Cave. Each night at 7:30, millions of bats spiral out of the deep cave and streak off toward the darkening southern sky. FRAN HUTCHINS: The Bracken Cave is the largest colony of bats in the world - somewhere between 15 and 20 million Mexican free-tail bats. PACE: Fran Hutchins, of Bat Conservation International, says Bracken Cave is a massive maternity ward for pregnant females coming back after wintering in Mexico. HUTCHINS: So they deposit the baby in what we call a nursery section of the cave, which is just millions of hairless baby bats. So when you look at it, it's a ceiling of pink, hairless baby bats. PACE: In wave after wave for almost four hours, the bats fly off to the cotton and corn fields in South Texas looking for food. HUTCHINS: A nursing mom is generating at least her weight in milk every day and she's going to eat her body weight in bugs every night. So this colony alone that's a hundred tons of bugs every night. PACE: The bat cave sits within a preserve, but next to the preserve is attractive land. And last year developers started advertising plans to build 3,500 homes there. That got conservationists worried. Andy Walker, of Bat Conservation International, says Mexican free-tail bats are attracted to houses and light. ANDY WALKER: We would've had hundreds of bats congregating on the porches, around streetlights, around swimming pools. Maybe bats that were either resting or sick or older bats that were sick might be found by family pets and brought into houses. PACE: As conservationists worried about the impact on the bats, health officials worried about the potential for the bats to spread rabies to humans. Bat defenders sprang into action. San Antonio councilman Ron Nirenberg went to the cave for the first time to see what the buzz was all about. COUNCILMAN RON NIRENBERG: When I came out to the Bracken Bat Cave for the very first time I could describe it as a spiritual experience. I mean, this is the glory of the Texas Hill Country. And if you're not moved to action to keep this a part of our Texas Hill Country for our enjoyment and the enjoyment of future generations then you probably should check your pulse. PACE: So Nirenberg teamed up with two counties, conservation groups and others to come up with money to buy the land from the developer and create a bigger buffer zone for the bat cave. NIRENBERG: We've worked for more than a year to coordinate what, at many times, has felt like an uphill battle, if not a hopeless situation. PACE: The developer wouldn't comment for the story. Laura Huffman, state director of the Nature Conservancy, says it's rare that cities get this kind of opportunity. LAURA HUFFMAN: The ability to protect this intact natural resource and this incredible congregation of mammals is magical.

That whole daylight saving thing is over, which means it gets darker earlier. For a lot of people, that might be a downer. You get home from work and it's pitch black outside. Maybe you skip that run because it just feels too cold and dark. Then you feel badly because you skipped that run and you open a bottle of whiskey instead. OK, I'm getting carried away. But you get my point. Some people are sad in the winter months, literally sad. They have seasonal affective disorder. They'd much rather frolic in the summer sun. But guess what? Sad can happen in reverse? DR. NORMAN ROSENTHAL: There are people who have a very hard time dealing with the summer. As the days become brighter and warmer, they become depressed, agitated, eat less, sleep less, lose weight, and are more likely to have suicidal feelings. MARTIN: That's Dr. Norman Rosenthal. He's a psychiatrist and professor at Georgetown University. He pioneered SAD back in the eighties. ROSENTHAL: Rather than being lethargic and sluggish, they're more agitated and activated. And they're depressed just like the winter counterparts but they are more likely to actually have suicidal ideas. MARTIN: It's the summer version of SAD. But for those people, this is the day that things start to get better. Dr. Rosenthal says the gradual drop in temperature creates a calming sort of feeling as opposed to the agitation that the summer heat can cause. It's also the time the rest of us who just like winter can spike our tea, get the cozy plaid blankets out of the attic, and watch television - I mean, read books, read a lot of books, lots of books. For more on the upsides to winter, we took to the streets of D. C. , where we found Jack Fitzpatrick. He's from Minnesota, so he might be sort of a pro at all this cold and dark, but we can also learn we can all learn something from his attitude. JACK FITZPATRICK: I love the transition. There is just so much time to spend inside 'cause you don't want to be outside. MARTIN: Alan Nguyen didn't grow up with Minnesota winters. He's from New Orleans. But he hates the heat. Cold weather is where he feels most himself. ALAN NGUYEN: I can go outside, and it's very serene when it's very snowy or even when it's a nice fall day. It just feels a lot better to me. It's hard to explain. MARTIN: I'm with you, Alan. And he waxed philosophical, too. NGUYEN: When it gets cold, inside of me I sort of understand that there's an end to things and that I can sort of complete the year. MARTIN: See, daylight saving time is deep. So don't just enjoy the extra hour of sleep. Be excited about the change, the chilly weather, and cozy darker nights. It's the best time, says Jack Fitzpatrick, to do the following.

Your cell phone probably adjusted automatically, but maybe the clock in your car did not leading to brief panic. Am I late for work? In the first of an occasional exploration of time that we're calling Tick-Tock, NPR's Geoff Brumfiel reports that sort of momentary confusion is nothing compared to the confusion facing researchers who study time. GEOFF BRUMFIEL, BYLINE: Here's the first question - what is time? O'BRIAN: My own personal opinion is that time is a human construct. BRUMFIEL: Tom O'Brian's opinion matters. He keeps time at the National Institute of Standards and Technology. O'BRIAN: It's a way that we as humans have developed to try to understand and put some order in this very fascinating and complex universe around us. BRUMFIEL: We bring order using clocks. And O'Brian oversees America's master clock, one of the most accurate clocks on the planet. O'BRIAN: And it is accurate to the equivalent of about 0. 000000000000001. I think I said it right, but I might've miscounted (laughter). BRUMFIEL: Put another way, this clock could tick for 300 million years and stay accurate to within a second, but here's the crazy thing. . . O'BRIAN: We can measure time much better than the weight of something or an electrical current, but what time really is a question that I can't answer for you, and I'm embarrassed to say that as chief of the Time and Frequency Division. But I feel I'm in good company because even people like Albert Einstein would readily admit that he didn't really understand what time was. BRUMFIEL: Maybe it's because we don't understand it that we keep trying to measure it more accurately, and why at the nearby University of Colorado they're developing a clock to end all clocks. So I'm standing in the basement of the University of Colorado Boulder, and it's just chaos - wires hanging from the ceiling, wires on all the tables, wires held up with binder clips. I mean, I have never seen such a mess. And this is the home of the most accurate clock on the planet. (SOUNDBITE OF CLOCK TICKING)BRUMFIEL: Actually this tangle of wires and lasers is the clock. It's spread out on a giant table, parts of it wrapped in shiny foil. There's tinfoil, man. How can the most accurate clock on the planet depend on tinfoil? TRAVIS NICHOLSON: Well, first of all that's research-grade tinfoil, so. . . BRUMFIEL: Graduate students Travis Nicholson and Sara Campbell keep the clock running day-to-day. Do you guys really know where all these wires go? SARA CAMPBELL: I think half of them go nowhere. NICHOLSON: Yeah. We can trace them out if we need to. BRUMFIEL: At its heart, this new clock is actually just atoms of an element called strontium. Strontium vibrates at an incredibly fast frequency. It's a natural, atomic metronome ticking out teeny, teeny fractions of a second. Jun Ye is the scientist who built this clock. He says it could keep perfect time for 5 billion years. JUN YE: It's about the whole entire age of the Earth. BRUMFIEL: So if this clock were running since the start of the age of the Earth, it would have the time down to within a second? YE: Right. And our aim is that we'll have a clock that would - during the entire age of the universe, would not have lost a second. BRUMFIEL: But this perfect clock has run into a big problem because this thing we call time doesn't tick at the same rate everywhere in the universe or even on our planet. On top of Mount Everest, time is passing just a little bit faster than it does in Death Valley. That's because the speed at which to time passes depends on the strength of gravity. You don't need to take this to extremes either. If you take a clock off the floor and hang on the wall. . . YE: The time will speed up by about one part in 10 to the 16. BRUMFIEL: One part in 10 to the 16 is a sliver of a second, but this isn't some effect of gravity on the clock's machinery. Time itself is flowing more quickly on the wall than on the floor. These differences didn't really matter till now, but this clock is so sensitive little changes in height throw it way off. YE: So we're talking about lifting up a couple centimeters and you will start to see that difference. BRUMFIEL: This new clock can sense the pace of time speeding up as it moves inch by inch away from the earth's core, and that's a problem because to actually use time, you need different clocks to agree on the time. Think about it - if I say let's meet at 3:30, we use our watches, but imagine a world in which your watch starts to tick faster because you're working on the floor above me. Your 3:30 happens earlier than mine. This clock works like that. Tiny shifts in the Earth's crust can throw it off even when it's sitting still. And two of them will never agree. YE: At this level, maintaining absolute timescale on Earth is in fact turning into nightmare. BRUMFIEL: This nightmare clock they've built doesn't just look chaotic; it's turning our sense of time into chaos. But Chief Timekeeper Tom O'Brian isn't worried about all this because as confusing as these clocks are, they're going to be really useful. O'BRIAN: Scientists can make these clocks into exquisite devices for sensing a whole bunch of different things. BRUMFIEL: They're getting so sensitive to gravity. Maybe they can map the interior of the Earth or detect gravitational waves from black holes and exploding stars. They could change our view of the universe. They just might not be able to tells what time it is. Geoff Brumfiel, NPR News. DAVID GREENE, HOST:   The days after the end of Daylight Saving Time can be a bit confusing.

I mean, I have never seen such a mess. And this is the home of the most accurate clock on the planet. (SOUNDBITE OF CLOCK TICKING) BRUMFIEL: Actually this tangle of wires and lasers is the clock. It's spread out on a giant table, parts of it wrapped in shiny foil. There's tinfoil, man. How can the most accurate clock on the planet depend on tinfoil? TRAVIS NICHOLSON: Well, first of all that's research-grade tinfoil, so. . . BRUMFIEL: Graduate students Travis Nicholson and Sara Campbell keep the clock running day-to-day. Do you guys really know where all these wires go? SARA CAMPBELL: I think half of them go nowhere. NICHOLSON: Yeah. We can trace them out if we need to. BRUMFIEL: At its heart, this new clock is actually just atoms of an element called strontium. Strontium vibrates at an incredibly fast frequency. It's a natural, atomic metronome ticking out teeny, teeny fractions of a second. Jun Ye is the scientist who built this clock. He says it could keep perfect time for 5 billion years. JUN YE: It's about the whole entire age of the Earth. BRUMFIEL: So if this clock were running since the start of the age of the Earth, it would have the time down to within a second? YE: Right. And our aim is that we'll have a clock that would - during the entire age of the universe, would not have lost a second. BRUMFIEL: But this perfect clock has run into a big problem because this thing we call time doesn't tick at the same rate everywhere in the universe or even on our planet. On top of Mount Everest, time is passing just a little bit faster than it does in Death Valley. That's because the speed at which to time passes depends on the strength of gravity. You don't need to take this to extremes either. If you take a clock off the floor and hang on the wall. . . YE: The time will speed up by about one part in 10 to the 16. BRUMFIEL: One part in 10 to the 16 is a sliver of a second, but this isn't some effect of gravity on the clock's machinery. Time itself is flowing more quickly on the wall than on the floor. These differences didn't really matter till now, but this clock is so sensitive little changes in height throw it way off. YE: So we're talking about lifting up a couple centimeters and you will start to see that difference. BRUMFIEL: This new clock can sense the pace of time speeding up as it moves inch by inch away from the earth's core, and that's a problem because to actually use time, you need different clocks to agree on the time. Think about it - if I say let's meet at 3:30, we use our watches, but imagine a world in which your watch starts to tick faster because you're working on the floor above me. Your 3:30 happens earlier than mine. This clock works like that. Tiny shifts in the Earth's crust can throw it off even when it's sitting still. And two of them will never agree. YE: At this level, maintaining absolute timescale on Earth is in fact turning into nightmare. BRUMFIEL: This nightmare clock they've built doesn't just look chaotic; it's turning our sense of time into chaos. But Chief Timekeeper Tom O'Brian isn't worried about all this because as confusing as these clocks are, they're going to be really useful. O'BRIAN: Scientists can make these clocks into exquisite devices for sensing a whole bunch of different things. BRUMFIEL: They're getting so sensitive to gravity. Maybe they can map the interior of the Earth or detect gravitational waves from black holes and exploding stars. They could change our view of the universe. They just might not be able to tells what time it is. Geoff Brumfiel, NPR News.", "section": "Science", "disclaimer": " Copyright \u00a9 2014 NPR.  All rights reserved.

They have dropped more than 25 percent since June. RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST: And that's pretty good news if you're filling up at the gas pump. GREENE: Not so good news, though, for businesses who use some pretty controversial methods to produce oil. What they do is becoming less profitable, in some cases even unprofitable. Both crude from Canada's tar sands and oil from fracking here in the United States are relatively expensive processes that require oil prices to stay high. Here's NPR's Jeff Brady. JEFF BRADY, BYLINE: Most of the world's oil sells for between $80 to $85 a barrel now, but not all oil is created equal. In the Middle East, it's cheaper to produce, less than $30 a barrel on average. In other parts of the world, companies pay a lot more to extract it, sometimes at a loss. PER MAGNUS NYSVEEN: The Arctic is a high-cost area, also oil sands. BRADY: At the Norwegian firm Rystad Energy, Per Magnus Nysveen is head of analysis. He says North American shale oil is on the expensive side. That's found in the middle of the country and needs fracking to force it out of the ground. On average, Nysveen says, this oil cost $62 a barrel. NYSVEEN: What is really interesting is for the U. S. drillers and producers is how long they are going to continue the high activity levels they have now that prices are going down. BRADY: Already, some companies are thinking about drilling fewer wells. (SOUNDBITE OF PUMP-JACK)BRADY: That's a large, tan pump-jack bobbing up and down next to a highway outside Midland, Texas. Fracking combined with horizontal drilling brought new life to the oil business here, but cheaper crude prices are forcing drillers like Steven Pruett of Elevation Resources to re-examine their plans. STEVEN PRUETT: We will drill fewer wells in a lower-price environment. BRADY: With less profit, there's less money to invest in future prospects. At current prices, oil will continue to flow, but not as much as if they went back up to $100. Pruett says this is not a crisis, though. PRUETT: We do not foresee a scenario where prices get so low that we can't cover the cash cost of lifting the barrels. So I don't think in this environment you will see a whole lot of oil and gas production shut in. BRADY: If prices collapsed to 2008 levels when it was $35 a barrel, drillers might be forced to take more drastic steps, like shutting down production, but few are predicting crude will fall that much. You might think a slowdown would be good news to environmental groups, but Jackie Savitz with Oceana says it's more complicated than that. JACKIE SAVITZ: You could make the argument either way. If oil is high, people will burn less; that's a good thing. If oil is low, maybe they'll drill less; that's a good thing. Really what we hope we'll do is we'll start making decisions based on the real science and the real impacts of burning fossil fuels. BRADY: Oceana is among groups calling for policies that speed up a transition to renewable forms of energy. While that could affect oil production, the market rules for now, and the lure of billions of dollars is hard for drillers to ignore. Even if drilling in the Arctic, for example, looks unprofitable for now, companies are committed to exploring there. Production costs tend to go down after new technologies have been around for a while, and Erik Milito with the American Petroleum Institute says global demand for oil continues to rise. ERIK MILITO: And that's the reason why companies are making these investments because they're long-term investments in projects that are expected to provide very large quantities of oil and natural gas for the U. S. economy and for the global account. BRADY: Still U. S. companies have to keep a close eye on their competitors abroad that can produce oil much more cheaply. That's why when OPEC meets later this month, a lot of people in the oil business will be watching to see if the cartel will push prices up or down. Jeff Brady, NPR News.

CHRISTOPHER JOYCE, BYLINE: The Wankel is destined to be the centerpiece for the new dinosaur hall at the National Museum of Natural History. But when it arrived at the museum, it was in pieces in packing crates. Rebecca Kaczkowski was on the welcoming committee. REBECCA KACZKOWSKI: We went up one freight elevator, came over to the rex room, dropped off the crates, yes. JOYCE: And here they are, right here behind you. KACZKOWSKI: Yep. JOYCE: Please do not touch the crates, it says. The rex room, as you might expect, is a very large workshop. Museum goers can look in and watch the scientists working on the skeleton. The first task is rehabbing the bones. They need work because when they were first discovered, they were in fragments. Kaczkowski says they've been glued together and sculpted with fillers to re-create their original shape. KACZKOWSKI: Since they've come out of the ground, we have done various preparation techniques and added man-made materials to them. All of those things have a lifetime, and that lifetime is much less than 67 million years. JOYCE: Preparators have to be sure that the glued-together bones will stand up to the stress of being mounted again. They're also scanning each bone with a device that looks like the one that reads the barcode on your groceries. That's Jon Blundell's job. JON BLUNDELL: We've never had such a complete T. rex here. It's a total blast. JOYCE: And not at all like scanning groceries. BLUNDELL: You can actually see new teeth in the jaw that are coming out. JOYCE: Un-erupted teeth still in the jaw. T. rex used to lose a lot of teeth. You can understand why given its feeding habits. So it was always growing new ones. The scans will produce a digital skeleton of the dinosaur. Then preparators will re-construct the whole animal virtually and then once more in the flesh, or at least the bone. The digital version will also be available on the Web. Preparator Steve Jabo says there are still things to be learned from the fossil, even though T. rex has been known for over a century. STEVE JABO: Who would've known we were going to be doing CT scanning or surface scans and stuff like that - or even being able to find, you know, evidence of color in feather impressions and stuff like that. JOYCE: Take the giant skull, for example. Matt Carrano, the curator of dinosaurs at the museum, says most T. rex skulls are either fragmentary or whole. MATT CARRANO: This one's actually fallen apart. So you get a good view of all the different sides of all the different bones. And that's a really important aspect to understanding how it goes together - how it functions. JOYCE: The digital version is all the Smithsonian scientists have at the moment. The bones have just been shipped to Canada - to one of the world's leading teams of dinosaur builders. They are constructing a huge armature that will cradle the re-assembled bones in a standing position. That will take two years, and two more years, to set it up back in Washington, D. C. In the meantime, Carrano is putting together the written material that museum goers will read as the Wankel looms over them.

JENNIFER SHINALL: Well, what my research indicates is that obese women are more likely to work in physical activity jobs and less likely to work in personal interaction jobs. Now, the reason that that's important is that personal interaction jobs pay more on average than physical activity jobs. On the flip side, physical activity jobs pay less on average. GRIGSBY BATES: Describe some of these jobs for us. What do you mean when you say personal interaction jobs as opposed to demanding activity jobs? SHINALL: So personal interaction jobs are jobs that require a high level of communication with others. So some of the characteristics I look at in my study are the amount of interaction you have with the public, how important communication with others is to your job, how important sales is to your job, how important interpersonal relationships are to your job. And so examples of occupations where things like that would be important, of course, are things like sales, reception, any kind of job where you will be called to be the face of the company. GRIGSBY BATES: Interestingly, as you say this, I'm just thinking, you know, I've sat in doctor's offices waiting for a physical - whatever. And you see reps for pharmaceutical companies come in. And I have never seen a really overweight woman dragging a samples case. It's always been women who look like what you would think the 1960s flight attendant would look like. So you're saying that's not an accident? SHINALL: That's not - it certainly doesn't seem to be an accident, and it's certainly consistent with what my research is finding. GRIGSBY BATES: But you're saying that obese men - similarly obese men - do not find their options narrowed this way. What does your research suggest is the reason for that? SHINALL: Well, I think my research is highly suggestive of sex-based discrimination. Employers don't mind if an obese man is the face of their company, but they have a very different attitude towards obese women. GRIGSBY BATES: I'm wondering if part of that goes back to the turn of the last century when obese men were considered powerful and prosperous, and it was desirable in some ways to look that way - when you think of William Howard Taft and how huge he was. Perhaps there is - or people don't think about a corollary for women - they don't think of being large and lush as necessarily desirable, even, let alone powerful. SHINALL: Right. I think that's absolutely right. There certainly seems to be different standards for men's appearance versus women's appearance. An anecdote that I often like to share is when I presented this research at a conference a few months ago, one response from an audience member was, well, this research makes absolute sense to me. Fat guys are fun. So I think there's also a sense of personality traits that go along with obesity may be different between men and women, as well. Whether that's true or not, you know, who knows? But I think there's certainly a conception that obese men are somehow different than obese woman. GRIGSBY BATES: Jennifer Shinall teaches at Vanderbilt Law School and joined us from their campus in Nashville. Thank you very much. SHINALL: Thank you for having me.

The U. S. aims to reduce emissions significantly over the next 10 years. The Chinese are not cutting their emissions now, but they say emissions will stop growing by the year 2030. As NPR's Christopher Joyce reports, climate experts say either goal will be tough to meet, but setting these targets could at least reinvigorate international negotiations on climate. CHRISTOPHER JOYCE, BYLINE: the deal made this week says the U. S. will cut its emissions a lot, bringing the level down 26 to 28 percent below what it was 10 years ago. The deadline for achieving that is 2025. China, however, is not cutting back any time soon. Rather, China says its emissions will peak by 2030 and then come down, and it promises to be generating a fifth of its energy from renewable carbon-free sources - wind, solar, nuclear, hydro - by that time. For people who have been in the thick of international climate negotiations, this is good news. ELLIOT DIRINGER: It's hard to imagine a more important signal than the world's two largest carbon emitters saying together that we think we can do this. JOYCE: Elliot Diringer is with the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, and he's been involved in climate talks since the first international treaty to curb emissions was drafted in Kyoto in 1997. That treaty is no longer in effect, and it actually did not bring down worldwide greenhouse gas emissions. Negotiations for another treaty are scheduled for the end of next year in Paris. Diringer says the China deal adds momentum to a process that has stagnated in recent years, and it applies what he calls institutionalized peer pressure to other large economies like India and Brazil. DIRINGER: If the U. S. and China are ready to enter into a deal - and let's not forget the European Union which also has its numbers out there - I think there will be strong pressure on other countries to be part of that deal. JOYCE: Diringer also notes that the deal breaks an impasse that's gone on for years between China and the U. S. Neither one wanted to do anything that would handicap its economy vis-a-vis the other's. DIRINGER: People on both sides have pointed to weak action by the other to delay action at home, and hopefully this announcement put those excuses behind us. JOYCE: But the U. S. Congress is unlikely to see this deal as a winner. Most Republicans are skeptical of climate deals and even the reality of global warming. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, among the most powerful members of the newly Republican Senate, said it's a bad deal. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)SENATOR MITCH MCCONNELL: The agreement requires the Chinese to do nothing at all for 16 years while these carbon emission regulations are creating havoc in my state and other states around the country. JOYCE: The regulations in question are being written by the Environmental Protection Agency. They will put sharp limits on carbon dioxide from coal fired power plants in the U. S. Republicans and some coal-state Democrats have vowed to fight them. And energy analysts say without those new regulations due out next year, there's no way the U. S. can make the president's new emissions target. Roger Pielke Jr. is a professor of environmental studies at the University of Colorado and a critic of the Kyoto approach of setting emissions targets and then figuring how to meet them. ROGER PIELKE: It's really important to understand that targets don't reduce emissions. Technology deployment reduces emissions. Without the plans in place for how we're going to expand nuclear or solar or wind, the targets are merely symbolic. JOYCE: But Pielke says there is value in this deal, even if the targets are going to be very difficult to meet. PIELKE: The best news to come out of this is that we have a measuring stick against which to actually evaluate progress. And within a year - two years, we will know if the U. S. and China are both serious about these commitments. JOYCE: The notches on that measuring stick, according to Pielke's calculations, require China to build a nuclear power plant a week or its equivalent in solar or wind to meet its goal. The U. S. will have to reduce its emissions by over 2 percent a year, starting now. Christopher Joyce, NPR News.

NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce has more on a controversy that's been called the shirt storm. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE, BYLINE: Matt Taylor is the project scientist for the European Space Agency. He's a young guy with tattoos and a beard who looks like he could be in a heavy metal band. You can go online and watch a video of a tattoo artist with a mohawk inking an image of the Rosetta spacecraft onto Taylor's thigh. Before the lander made its triumphant touchdown on the comet, Taylor spoke about the Rosetta mission on the space agency's live webcast. (SOUNDBITE OF WEBCAST)MATT TAYLOR: I've said it before - Rosetta is the sexiest mission that's ever been. She is sexy, but I never said she was easy. GREENFIELDBOYCE: As he said this, Katie Mack was watching. She's a theoretical astrophysicist at the University of Melbourne in Australia. She noticed that Taylor was wearing a brightly colored shirt. KATIE MACK: And I looked closer and noticed that it was covered in, like, women in lingerie - like, cartoon women in lingerie. And that was the design of the shirt. GREENFIELDBOYCE: The buxom babes were provocatively posed and shooting laser guns. They looked like illustrations from sci-fi pulp fiction. Mack thought that Taylor's comments and his shirt were just not appropriate for a worldwide broadcast of a major science event. MACK: To me, it seemed like it was really unwelcoming to women in science to have the lead scientist be wearing women as decoration. GREENFIELDBOYCE: She says, OK, it's just a shirt. But little things like this add up to a real problem for science. MACK: It's not a big deal, but it's part of a big deal. GREENFIELDBOYCE: She made some Twitter comments, as did many others. Then came the backlash - people telling the women to kill themselves or making vile sexual remarks. MACK: You know, just tweeting profanities at me - just earlier tonight I got an e-mail with the subject heading, you make me sick. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Today, on a webcast about the comet mission, Matt Taylor wore a plain black sweatshirt. He looked stricken. When a moderator asked him about the data coming back from the comet probe, he didn't answer right away. Instead, he talked about the shirt. (SOUNDBITE OF WEBCAST)TAYLOR: I - the shirt I wore this week - I made a big mistake, and I offended many people. And I am very sorry about this. GREENFIELDBOYCE: As he struggled to compose himself, a colleague patted his shoulder. After a moment, Taylor began to talk about the science. Nell Greenfieldboyce, NPR News. AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:  Some women became targets of nasty online comments just this week because they dared to complain about a shirt - a shirt worn by a scientist with the Rosetta Mission, which just landed a small probe on a comet. NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce has more on a controversy that's been called the shirt storm. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE, BYLINE: Matt Taylor is the project scientist for the European Space Agency. He's a young guy with tattoos and a beard who looks like he could be in a heavy metal band. You can go online and watch a video of a tattoo artist with a mohawk inking an image of the Rosetta spacecraft onto Taylor's thigh. Before the lander made its triumphant touchdown on the comet, Taylor spoke about the Rosetta mission on the space agency's live webcast. (SOUNDBITE OF WEBCAST) MATT TAYLOR: I've said it before - Rosetta is the sexiest mission that's ever been. She is sexy, but I never said she was easy. GREENFIELDBOYCE: As he said this, Katie Mack was watching. She's a theoretical astrophysicist at the University of Melbourne in Australia. She noticed that Taylor was wearing a brightly colored shirt. KATIE MACK: And I looked closer and noticed that it was covered in, like, women in lingerie - like, cartoon women in lingerie. And that was the design of the shirt. GREENFIELDBOYCE: The buxom babes were provocatively posed and shooting laser guns. They looked like illustrations from sci-fi pulp fiction. Mack thought that Taylor's comments and his shirt were just not appropriate for a worldwide broadcast of a major science event. MACK: To me, it seemed like it was really unwelcoming to women in science to have the lead scientist be wearing women as decoration. GREENFIELDBOYCE: She says, OK, it's just a shirt. But little things like this add up to a real problem for science. MACK: It's not a big deal, but it's part of a big deal. GREENFIELDBOYCE: She made some Twitter comments, as did many others. Then came the backlash - people telling the women to kill themselves or making vile sexual remarks. MACK: You know, just tweeting profanities at me - just earlier tonight I got an e-mail with the subject heading, you make me sick. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Today, on a webcast about the comet mission, Matt Taylor wore a plain black sweatshirt. He looked stricken. When a moderator asked him about the data coming back from the comet probe, he didn't answer right away. Instead, he talked about the shirt. (SOUNDBITE OF WEBCAST) TAYLOR: I - the shirt I wore this week - I made a big mistake, and I offended many people. And I am very sorry about this. GREENFIELDBOYCE: As he struggled to compose himself, a colleague patted his shoulder. After a moment, Taylor began to talk about the science.

PAUL BLOOM: I think that's an understandable conclusion, but it's not right. RAZ: This is Paul Bloom. He teaches psychology at Yale. BLOOM: And I think that if you think of stereotypes as a flaw in our mind, some sort of pathology or cruelty, you actually won't understand them very well. You won't know how to combat them. RAZ: Paul studies human behavior, in particular why we all make quick judgments about other people. BLOOM: You know, you don't ask a toddler for directions, you don't ask a very old person to help you move a sofa and that's because you stereotype. Now, stereotypes then go awry in all sorts of ways and they cause horrible moral problems and horrible rational problems, but this is because a system that has been evolved to make generalizations in certain circumstances can go wrong in other circumstances. RAZ: So when Paul explain this idea on the TED stage, he explained how the mind does this. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)BLOOM: So you look at me. You know my name, you know certain facts about me and you could make certain judgments. You could make guesses about my ethnicity, my political affiliation, my religious beliefs and the thing is these judgments tend to be accurate. We're very good at this sort of thing and we're very good at this sort of thing because our ability to stereotype people is not some sort of arbitrary quirk of the mind, but rather it's a specific instance of a more general process, which is that we have experience with things and people in the world that fall into categories and we could use our experience to make generalizations of novel instances of these categories. So everyone here has a lot of experience with chairs and apples and dogs, and based on this, you could see these unfamiliar examples and you could guess - you could sit on the chair, you could eat the apple, the dog will bark. Now, we might be wrong. The chair could collapse if you sit on it, the apple might be poisoned, the dog might not bark, but for the most part, we're good at this. For the most part, we make good guesses both in the social domain and in the non-social domain and if we weren't able to do so - we weren't able to make guesses about new instances that we encounter, we wouldn't survive. RAZ: What assumptions do we make like, pretty much right away when we encounter somebody? BLOOM: The big three that social psychologists talk about are age, sex and race so when you look at somebody, in a fraction of a second, you record a kid, an adult, an old person, man, woman, Chinese, American, black, white, whatever. You do this in a fraction of a second. It's unconscious. It's very powerful. And those generalizations show up as early as you can test them so babies like to hear their own language over other languages, they like to look at faces that are familiar over those that are unfamiliar and actually like to look at familiar races over unfamiliar races. So a white baby raised by white people prefers to look at white faces than black faces. Though, it's not the baby's own race so if the baby's white but raised by a multi-ethnic bunch, the baby will show no preferences. RAZ: Ok so I mean, I get age, I get gender, but why are we wired to see race so differently when - I mean, didn't we all look the same in East Africa like, 40,000 years ago? BLOOM: I think that's an excellent point and I mentioned the three generalizations, sex and age and race, but a lot of evolutionary theorists point it out that race is the odd man out for the reasons that you pointed out. Sex and age are always going to be relevant for any primate, but race is a novelty. It's a modern thing that's emerged only in recent history and so our focus on race then is less determined than our focus on sex and age and this fits very nicely with the data from children. So there's no experiment that's ever found that children don't care about sex and age when making decisions. They're always sensitive to it, but when kids pay attention to race it's not because they're biologically built to be intuitive racists, but rather it's because they've learned that race matters in a world we live in. RAZ: And Paul says the problem is that racial stereotypes are often flat-out wrong. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)BLOOM: There was a fascinating study prior to the 2008 election where social psychologists looked at the extent to which the candidates were associated with America, as in an unconscious association with the American flag and in one of their studies they compared Obama and McCain and they found McCain is more thought of as more American than Obama. And to some extent, people aren't that surprised by hearing that - McCain is a celebrated war hero and many people would explicitly say he has more of an American story that Obama, but they also compared Obama to British prime minister, Tony Blair and they found that Blair was also thought of as more American than Obama even though subjects explicitly understood that he's not American at all. (LAUGHTER)BLOOM: But they were responding, of course, to the color of his skin. RAZ: That is amazing to me, that people would say that and you think about it and you think, well, I wouldn't say that but then you think, well, maybe I would. BLOOM: So that's right - so there's so many social psychology experiments showing - and this is really the pernicious side of stereotypes - that even in cases where we know a stereotype doesn't apply or we know it's mistaken, we're guided by it anyway and these are done for the most part, I think, by well-intentioned people who would never dream that they'd be racist, but we are influenced by factors we don't know about. RAZ: You know, earlier Jamila Lyiscott was talking about language as a conveyor of stereotypes, right, about how being called articulate for example, is a code. BLOOM: Yes, I think Joe Biden slipped up and called Obama articulate in the primaries. RAZ: Yeah. I mean, this has real-world consequences. I mean, this is a real thing that happens everywhere all the time, every day, every second of the day. BLOOM: It's as if you called an elderly relative lucid, you know? Thanks, thanks a lot. So you're right, language often reveals your expectations. To call somebody articulate is, in some way, reflecting the intuition that this is a surprising fact. Or, to say somebody's clean or composed or, you know, non-aggressive, it would be an odd thing to say, unless you believed or had some reason to believe that they weren't. BLOOM: So now that we know about this, how do we combat it? And there are different avenues. One avenue is to appeal to people's emotional responses, to appeal to people's empathy and we often do that through stories. Stories can turn anonymous strangers into people who matter and the idea that we care about people when we focus on them as individuals is an idea which has shown up across history. Psychologists have explored this. For instance, in one study, people were given a list of facts about a crisis and it was seen how much they would donate and another group was given no facts at all, but they were told of an individual and given a name and given a face. And it turns out that they gave far more. It's possible that by extending our sympathies to an individual, they can spread to the group that the individual belongs to. RAZ: I mean, it's almost - it's like a case for making a conscious choice and decision to reach out to people who are different from you. BLOOM: It really is - so you can't change implicit biases by just sitting in your room and concentrating and saying, I'm not going to be racist, I'm not going to be racist, but what you can do is you could actively expose yourself to real-world instances, which give you maybe a more accurate and more fair representation of these groups. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)BLOOM: I think prejudice and bias illustrate a fundamental duality of human nature. We have gut feelings, instincts, emotions and they affect our judgments and actions for good and for evil, but we are also capable of rational deliberation and intelligent planning and we can use these to, in some cases, accelerate and nourish our emotions and in other cases staunch them and it's in this way that reason helps us create a better world. Thank you. (APPLAUSE)RAZ: Paul Bloom is a professor of psychology at Yale University. He has two fascinating talks up at ted. com.

It's called \"Interstellar. \" Here's the setup without giving away too much. It's a little bit in the future. Things are looking really bad on Earth. Some astronauts go out exploring for a new planet to move to. And when a movie like this comes out, we like to do a reality check with our favorite science-fiction fan, astrophysicist Neil DeGrasse Tyson, director of the Hayden Planetarium in New York City. He is on the line with us. Great to have you back, as always. NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: Thank you. Thank you. GREENE: So trying not to give too much away - no spoilers. In this movie, these astronauts are searching for a new home for humanity. And they use this favorite sci-fi method of transportation - a wormhole. What exactly is that? TYSON: Well, a wormhole, as you noted, it's a science-fiction writer's favorite way to get from one place to another because you get to bypass the speed limit imposed by the speed of light. And that's really fast for anything we would normally encounter in everyday life. But if you want to cross the galaxy, you would be long dead before you got there. And so a wormhole is a literal and figurative shortcut through the fabric of space. And you take your destination, wherever it is, warp the space between you and it, but you bend it back on itself. And then you cut a hole out of your dimension through a higher dimension and reappear in the dimension you just left. GREENE: Wow. TYSON: It's like taking a sheet of paper, and you want to get from one edge to the other, but fold it over. GREENE: I'm doing that right now. I'm taking the notes I have here and just folding the piece of paper. And I just push a hole through it, and then I can. . . TYSON: Get that wormhole going in your notes. (Laughter) That's right. GREENE: Could you and I in theory really do this and survive as humans? TYSON: The math and the physics of it is sound. But we don't know how to make one. And even if we did make one, the equations show that they're unstable and that they would collapse upon you if you tried to go through. So that's where the science fiction comes in. GREENE: That sounds bad - the collapsing. TYSON: Yeah. Yeah. It's really bad. I hate it when that happens. GREENE: Once they made it through the wormhole and found these other potential planets to move humanity to, you in a tweet suggested you weren't impressed with these planets. You said Mars right next-door looks way safer than these planets they travel to. Why do you say that? TYSON: (Laughter) Yeah. No, I thought the planets they portrayed in \"Interstellar\" - you know, they were kind of borderline. It's like I don't know if this is where I want to live. And they still need their spacesuits. And so Mars is way closer, and you need your spacesuit there - and looked kind of more interesting than some planets they showed there. So you're going to go - you're going to cross the galaxy and land in a place that's not even as good as Mars? GREENE: Let me ask you one more question. The astronauts spend a very short amount of time on one planet. But in that short amount of time, years go by elsewhere, including on Earth. Is that relativity? And if so, did they nail it? TYSON: Yes. If you are in the presence of a strong gravity, you will have noticeable effects on how slow your time ticks relative to anybody else who's looking at you from the outside. And their ratio of how slowly they age versus everybody else was extreme. But they made it clear this is a planet a orbiting a black hole. It's a time dilation effect, it's called. And this is real by the way. Our GPS satellites are farther away from Earth's center of gravity than we are. So time ticks more slowly for us. And so the time that they send to us, to our - all of our devices, are pre-corrected for the effects of general relativity. So that we on Earth, in a different time-dilated place, will have the correct time for our world. GREENE: So we know it exists. It's just a very extreme form in the movie because of this black hole. TYSON: Precisely. It's an extreme form. GREENE: Neil DeGrasse Tyson is host of Star Talk Radio - a rival radio show. He's director of the Hayden Planetarium in New York City. And you're like a Twitter machine. Remind us where people can follow you. TYSON: Oh, thanks. It's just @NeilTyson, N-E-I-L-T-Y-S-O-N. Thanks. Yeah. I mean, I don't - don't come to me as a news source. I'm just sharing with you my brain droppings that without Twitter, they would just - I would think it, and they would just get lost.

Even in the Deep South, residents struggled with temperatures in the low 20s. With a big chill comes the revival of that ominous sounding phrase - the polar vortex. Michell Eloy from member Station WABE in Atlanta reports. MICHELL ELOY, BYLINE: Lately, it's been hard to escape the phrase. (SOUNDBITE OF VARIOUS NEWS REPORTS)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #1: The return of the polar vortex. UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #2: A dreaded return of the polar vortex. UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #3: New polar vortex could put the squeeze on holiday shopping. UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #4: Chicago is already storing salt like a squirrel stores nuts. ELOY: \"The Today Show\" used it in promos this past week. (SOUNDBITE OF \"THE TODAY SHOW\" PROMO)UNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER: You've got to face the polar vortex. ELOY: And \"The Tonight Show's\" Jimmy Fallon poked fun at the hype. (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"THE TONIGHT SHOW\")JIMMY FALLON: Pro, it's a phenomenon that signals the return to colder temperatures across North America. Con is it used to be called the month of November. ELOY: And that's exactly what Jeff Masters wants people to understand. JEFF MASTERS: This is just a regular old cold front. ELOY: Masters is chief meteorologist at weatherunderground. com. He says the recent popularity of the phrase is misleading. MASTERS: The polar vortex has been around forever. And it's just the media happened to notice it last year. And it's really not a very scientifically accurate thing to talk about saying, you know, we're getting the polar vortex. ELOY: And in fact, some Atlantans who braved the cold had heard the phrase, but weren't really sure what it meant. JANET CROSS: Does is have something to do with the large ice caps that are melting? VIVIAN COOK: The poles are vortexing. LAURA REECE: Cold wind blows off the North and South Poles and circulates around. I don't really know. ELOY: That's Janet Cross, Vivian Cook and Laura Reece. So here's what the polar vortex really is. It's a constant flow of arctic air circling in the upper atmosphere above the North and South Poles. The cold is usually corralled up there. But sometimes little bits of the Arctic air escape. Again, Weather Underground's Jeff Masters. MASTERS: It's just the ordinary sort of weather you expect in winter. Every now and then, you get a trough of low pressure. It dips down from the pole, allows arctic air to seep southwards. ELOY: Which isn't to say the polar vortex wasn't involved in this bout of unseasonably cold weather. Masters says the typhoon that hit Alaska last week pushed one of those troughs of arctic air south across the Eastern U. S. Steven Nelson with the National Weather Service says these temperature shifts serve a purpose. STEVEN NELSON: These cold intrusions, cold fronts are really restoring the balance in the temperature and moisture across the Earth's surface. ELOY: A good chunk of the south is expected to get another wave of unseasonably cold weather starting Monday. Just don't call it the polar vortex. For NPR News, I'm Michell Eloy in Atlanta.

I'm Guy Raz. John Francis is an environmental activist. In about a month, after he decided to stop talking, things started to get quiet. JOHN FRANCIS: Even though I wasn't speaking, I was thinking about conversations and arguments that I had in the past. And - oh, maybe I should have said that, or next time I'm going to say this. And it took about a month before the conversations stop rattling. And so when that happened, I could hear myself I think for the first time in a very long time. RAZ: That was in 1973. And on his birthday that year, John Francis stopped talking. Now, this was about 18 months after he stopped doing something else that seems both eccentric and impossible. John stopped riding in cars. And it happened on a particular day in 1971. John was walking along San Francisco Bay when two oil tankers collided. And he watched as thousands of gallons of black oil seeped into the water. And so on that day, John Francis vowed to give up all forms of gas-powered transportation. And he decided, instead, to walk - everywhere. FRANCIS: So I argued a lot with people about my walking and how one person might make a difference. I don't think I was convinced myself that one person could make a difference. And I decided that I would give my community a gift of my not speaking so much. RAZ: So people would come up to you and say, hey, get in the car, man. Why don't you just stop doing that? And you would argue with them, and it just started to get you down? FRANCIS: Yeah. Well, you know, it's just like I was - what I was doing mostly was kind of defending myself and arguing, yeah. So I wanted to stop that. RAZ: So you just decided to stop talking? FRANCIS: Yeah but just for one day. That was my idea was just to not speak for one day. But it just went on. But if I had started and someone said, John, if you stop speaking today, you're not going to speak for 17 years, I might not have gone on. RAZ: Finding quiet isn't always an easy thing. I mean, it took John Francis 17 years. The world he lives in - the world we all live in - is noisy. And it's usually the loudest people who get most of the attention. So today on the show - quiet - ideas about quiet people, quiet minds and finding stillness in unexpected places. During all that time that you didn't speak, was your inner voice the same? I mean, did it sound the same as the voice we're hearing now? FRANCIS: You know, I don't think so. It was - I think my inner voice was different somehow.

He's the guy that we heard from earlier in the show who took a 17-year vow of silence, which, by the way, even John admits is totally nuts. JOHN FRANCIS: I do. I feel like even now I look back and say, what did you do? I mean, how did you do that? RAZ: Yeah. FRANCIS: I even ask myself. RAZ: Here is the story as John told it from the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)FRANCIS: My journey began in 1971 when I witnessed two oil tankers collide beneath the Golden Gate and half a million gallons of oil spilled into the bay. It disturbed me so much that I decided that I was going to give up riding and driving in motorized vehicles. That's a big thing in California. And people would drive up next to me and say, John, what are you doing? And I'd say, well, I'm walking for the environment. And they said, no, you're walking to make us look bad, right? And so I argued with people about that. I argued and I argued. I called my parents up. I said, I've given up riding and driving in cars. My dad said, why didn't you do that when you were 16? (LAUGHTER)FRANCIS: I didn't know about the environment then there back in Philadelphia. And so I told my mother I'm happy though. I'm really happy. She said and if you were happy, son, you wouldn't have to say it. Mothers are like that. (LAUGHTER)FRANCIS: And so on my 27th birthday, I decided because I argued so much and I talk so much, you see, that I was going to stop speaking for just one day - one day to give it a rest. And so I did. I got up in the morning, and I didn't say a word. RAZ: It sounds like you were at a place in life where - I don't know - a part of you was unhappy with the kind of person that you had become and that you were almost looking to figure out a way to transform that into something else. FRANCIS: That's interesting. I think that the reason why I stopped speaking may have been to avoid arguments. But I think that as the journey went on there were just other things that piqued my interest about not speaking. And so in order to at least satisfy myself, I made the promise or the vow, I guess, that I would revisit that decision on my birthday. And that ended the questioning of when I was going to speak. I didn't have to ask myself every day, is - are you going to speak today? I just didn't do that. I just said I was going to not speak for one year, and then I'd see what would happen. RAZ: So a year became two - then three. And soon, John had gone to college, earned a PhD, walked across the entire country, all without speaking. And when he met someone new. . . FRANCIS: I would cross my heart, put a finger over my mouth like, you know, I'm promising to be silent. And then I would cup my hand around my ear and nod so that you could say that oh, I can hear. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: Maybe I can understand not driving, maybe - but not talking? RAZ: About 14 years into his silence - this is in 1987. CBS aired the story about John who, by that time, had walked all over the country and all over the world. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: A long time ago you talked, right? You talked real well. You were a smooth talker. RAZ: In this story, he communicated with his own form of sign language- gestures, facial expressions - and it's actually surprisingly easy to understand what he's trying to say. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: Inside your head - it started to get quiet inside your head? You started listening. RAZ: When you were out there on your own, was your mind clear? Was it full? Was it quiet? Was it loud? Like, what do you remember? FRANCIS: Yeah, there were - there's a couple of things that when I'm walking - and I might be thinking of the road and where I'm going. But at some point, I realized that as I'm walking, I'm not thinking about the road and where I'm going. In fact, I catch myself not thinking. And then I'm thinking again, of course. But so there are long periods of times that I was just being on the planet and breathing. And I think maybe breathing has a lot to do with that. RAZ: As the years went by, John did a lot of writing. He was named a goodwill ambassador to the U. N. And he became known as the planet walker, all without using his voice. And then one day, he was wandering through a prison town in Venezuela, and he was suddenly struck by a thought that, in some ways, he had become a prisoner, too. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)FRANCIS: The prison that I was in was the fact that I did not drive or use motorized vehicles. Now, how could that be? Because when I started, it seemed very appropriate to me not to use motorized vehicles. But the thing that was different was every birthday I asked myself about silence, but I never asked myself about my decision to just use my feet. I didn't know who I would be if I changed. And I know that a lot of times we find ourselves in this wonderful place where we've gotten to. But there's another place for us to go. And we kind of have to leave behind the security of who we've become and go to the place where who we are becoming. So I want to thank you for being here, and I want to end this in five seconds of silence. Thank you. (APPLAUSE)RAZ: I mean, it is true, like, you think about silence and most of us don't experience that on a day-to-day basis - right? - because we go to our jobs and we live - whether we live in a city or not, like, we still interact with people. And there's sounds, and there's noise in our minds. But then sometimes you do experience it. Like you go to a church or a really quiet space, and you realize the power of quiet. FRANCIS: It is pervasive. I mean, it's there. We just have to hear it, listening. I mean, what happened for me was that I just began to learn so much. I began to learn, at least, what other people felt. And what they wanted to say before cutting them off with my own, you know, diatribe. I would - I used to do that. I used to listen to someone just enough to think I knew what they were going to say, and then I would stop listening because I thought I knew what they were going to say. And then I would start thinking about what I was going to say back to show them that they were wrong or that I could say that better or look how smart I am. And so that was a great relief to me because I was just able to learn from so many people and, you know, people have so much to teach one another if we listen to each other. So I was very fortunate to discover that I think. RAZ: After 17 years of silence, John Francis got so good at listening to other people that he'd almost become a different person. And the voice he once had - kind of angry, a little combative, unsure - it was gone. And so on Earth Day in 1990, John gathered a bunch of friends and family and he told them to meet him at a hotel in Washington, D. C. And he stood in front of them, and for the first time in 17 years, he spoke. FRANCIS: And I said thank you for being here. And I kind oflooked behind me because I thought someone was standing behind me who had somehow said what I was thinking. And then I realized it was me. RAZ: John Francis.

I'm Guy Raz and on the show today, Quiet. Now, it might seem strange to think of noise as the thing you would seek out if you were trying to quiet things down, right? But for some people, noise - it's the only remedy. (SOUNDBITE OF MEGAN WASHINGTON SONG, \"HOLY MOSES\")RAZ: So this is music from Megan - actually, Megan, why don't you introduce yourself, please? MEGAN WASHINGTON: My name is Megan Washington and I am a musician from Australia. RAZ: And Megan's not just some random Australian musician. She's a pretty big deal there. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"HOLY MOSES\")WASHINGTON: (Singing) Hey, how we breathe and how we choke. RAZ: Her records have gone platinum. She performs in front of thousands of people. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"HOLY MOSES\")WASHINGTON: (Singing) Your heart is broke. (SOUNDBITE OF INTERVIEW)UNIDENTIFIED MAN: It's sounding like next year's going to be a pretty big one for you. WASHINGTON: Yeah, and I'm really excited about it. RAZ: On the face of it, Megan seems like a total extrovert. I mean, just listen to this TV interview because she sounds like - she sounds like a pop star. (SOUNDBITE OF INTERVIEW)WASHINGTON: I've been in London all year making an album and it's coming out next year. We'll have some new music in about February, or January, or March, who knows? Mystery, mystery. RAZ: Now, this is the person Megan Washington has to be. Sort of like what Susan Cain was just saying, that our value is measured, in a lot of ways, by how charismatic we are and so a lot of us try to be that, including Megan Washington. So when she went up on the TED stage Megan revealed a secret that even some of her really close friends never knew. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)WASHINGTON: I have a problem. It's not the worst thing in the world - I'm fine. I'm not on fire. I know that other people in the world have far worse things to deal with, but for me, language and music are inextricably linked through this one thing and the thing is that I have a stutter. It might seem curious, given that I spend a lot of my life on the stage. One would assume that I'm comfortable in the public sphere and comfortable here speaking to you guys, but the truth is that I've spent my life up into this point and including this point, living in mortal dread of public speaking. Public singing - whole different thing. (LAUGHTER)WASHINGTON: But we'll get to that in a moment. I've never really talked about it before so explicitly. I think that that's because I've always lived in hope that when I was a grown-up I wouldn't have one. I'm 28. I'm pretty sure that I'm grown now. (LAUGHTER)WASHINGTON: And I'm an adult woman who spends her life as a performer with a speech impediment so I may as well come clean about it. RAZ: So Megan, this was like, a really big deal when you said this because people were surprised, right? WASHINGTON: Weirdly, yeah. I don't know, I just assumed that everybody knew that I was hiding it or disguising it, but I was quite surprised by how many people didn't know, which was everybody (laughter). RAZ: When did you realize that singing would enable you to completely overcome it? WASHINGTON: Well, singing is a pretty common therapy for speech disorder, in general. RAZ: If you were to sing this - your answers - to me, you would not have any stutter? WASHINGTON: Nope. I would not have any stutter (laughter). RAZ: That's amazing, isn't it? WASHINGTON: But you know Guy, like - I can do the voice, if you want - like, there's a voice, like a character's voice, where, you know, that I use in life to get through interviews like this one when my stutter is not sort of welcome. RAZ: What's the voice sound like? WASHINGTON: (Speaking in different voice) Well, it's just sort of like this and you wouldn't really tell that it's different to my other voice, except that when I use this voice, you know, everything just comes out really smoothly. I sound much more confident and nothing happens, you know, it's fine, and the problem with this voice is (speaking in regular voice) it's not my voice, you know what I mean? It's not my \u2013 it\u2019s the voice that gets the job done. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)WASHINGTON: But as an artist who feels that their work is based solely on a platform of honesty and being real, that feels often like cheating. Which is why before I sing, I wanted to tell you what singing means to me. It's more than making nice sounds and it's more than making nice songs. It's more than feeling known or understood. It's more than making you feel the things that I feel. Somehow, through some miraculous synaptic function of the human brain, it's impossible to stutter when you sing. RAZ: When you sing and when you sort of discovered that this was a way for you to express yourself fluidly, it's almost like you are quieting down this thing inside of you that you don't have control over otherwise. WASHINGTON: That's completely accurate. I find the act of singing extremely - the word I want to use is tenseless. When I speak a lot, you know, I often find that the muscles in my jaw and my tongue are quite tense and it's - you know it takes a lot of effort to kind of get things out in a way that makes sense and you're always sort of excusing words that you've tried to say and just the simplicity of singing is a place of stillness and calm. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)WASHINGTON: Singing for me is sweet relief. It is the only time when I feel fluent. It is the only time when what comes out of my mouth is comprehensively exactly what I intended. (LAUGHTER)WASHINGTON: So I know that this is a TED Talk, but now I'm going to TED sing. (LAUGHTER)WASHINGTON: This is a song that I wrote last year. Thank you very much. Thank you. (APPLAUSE)RAZ: Australian singer-songwriter Megan Washington. Her newest album, \"There There,\" came out in September. Check out her full talk at ted. com. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG)WASHINGTON: (Singing) I would be a beauty, but my nose is slightly too big for my face and I would be a dreamer, but my dream is slightly too big for this space. GUY RAZ, HOST:  It's the TED Radio Hour from NPR. I'm Guy Raz and on the show today, Quiet. Now, it might seem strange to think of noise as the thing you would seek out if you were trying to quiet things down, right? But for some people, noise - it's the only remedy. (SOUNDBITE OF MEGAN WASHINGTON SONG, \"HOLY MOSES\") RAZ: So this is music from Megan - actually, Megan, why don't you introduce yourself, please? MEGAN WASHINGTON: My name is Megan Washington and I am a musician from Australia. RAZ: And Megan's not just some random Australian musician. She's a pretty big deal there. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"HOLY MOSES\") WASHINGTON: (Singing) Hey, how we breathe and how we choke. RAZ: Her records have gone platinum. She performs in front of thousands of people. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"HOLY MOSES\") WASHINGTON: (Singing) Your heart is broke. (SOUNDBITE OF INTERVIEW) UNIDENTIFIED MAN: It's sounding like next year's going to be a pretty big one for you. WASHINGTON: Yeah, and I'm really excited about it. RAZ: On the face of it, Megan seems like a total extrovert. I mean, just listen to this TV interview because she sounds like - she sounds like a pop star. (SOUNDBITE OF INTERVIEW) WASHINGTON: I've been in London all year making an album and it's coming out next year. We'll have some new music in about February, or January, or March, who knows? Mystery, mystery. RAZ: Now, this is the person Megan Washington has to be. Sort of like what Susan Cain was just saying, that our value is measured, in a lot of ways, by how charismatic we are and so a lot of us try to be that, including Megan Washington. So when she went up on the TED stage Megan revealed a secret that even some of her really close friends never knew. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) WASHINGTON: I have a problem. It's not the worst thing in the world - I'm fine. I'm not on fire. I know that other people in the world have far worse things to deal with, but for me, language and music are inextricably linked through this one thing and the thing is that I have a stutter. It might seem curious, given that I spend a lot of my life on the stage. One would assume that I'm comfortable in the public sphere and comfortable here speaking to you guys, but the truth is that I've spent my life up into this point and including this point, living in mortal dread of public speaking. Public singing - whole different thing. (LAUGHTER) WASHINGTON: But we'll get to that in a moment. I've never really talked about it before so explicitly.

I'm Guy Raz. And on the show today, ideas about Quiet. So about 10 years ago, Gavin Pretor-Pinney, who's a graphic designer, moved from the U. K. to Rome for about a year. And he would wander around the city, pop into museums and churches, and he started to notice a pattern in the artwork. GAVIN PRETOR-PINNEY: There were lots of clouds - clouds in the Baroque frescoes, clouds in the churches in Rome. When I came back, I thought, you know, maybe clouds are something I should do something with more generally. RAZ: Gavin mentioned the idea to a friend who suggested he give a talk at a local arts festival. But he worried that nobody would show up to a presentation about clouds. PRETOR-PINNEY: So I called it The Inaugural Lecture of the Cloud Appreciation Society. RAZ: And it worked. PRETOR-PINNEY: But of course, they all came up to me afterwards and said that was great, you know, how do I join your society? RAZ: And at that moment, the Cloud Appreciation Society was born. That was a few years ago. And it literally changed Gavin's life because his future wife also became a member. PRETOR-PINNEY: We've got two kids. And the oldest one, Flora, her middle name is Cirrus, actually. RAZ: Oh. . . PRETOR-PINNEY: Yeah. RAZ: . . . Makes perfect sense. PRETOR-PINNEY: I love it. I love it for that one. RAZ: And so, as Gavin says in his TED Talk, there's something about that quiet moment when you stop, look up and notice a cloud. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)PRETOR-PINNEY: But I think they're beautiful. Don't you? It's just that their beauty is missed because they are so omnipresent, so - I don't know - commonplace that people don't notice them. They don't notice the beauty, but they don't even notice the clouds unless they get in the way of the sun. They think of them as the annoying, frustrating obstructions. And then they rush off and do some blue-sky thinking. But most people, when you stop to ask them, will admit to harboring a strange sort of fondness for clouds. It's like a nostalgic fondness, and they make them think of their youth. Who here can't remember thinking of looking and finding shapes in the clouds when they were kids? You know, when you were masters of daydreaming. It's just that these days, us adults seem reluctant to allow ourselves the indulgence of just allowing our imaginations to drift along in the breeze. And I think that's a pity. I think we should perhaps do a bit more of it. I think we should be a bit more willing, perhaps, to look at the beautiful sight of the sunlight bursting out from behind the clouds. And go wait a minute - there's two cats dancing the salsa, or seeing the big - the big, white, puffy one up there over the shopping center looks like the abominable snowman going to rob a bank. (LAUGHTER)RAZ: So why do we forget to do that - I mean, to just like look at the sky and let our imaginations run wild? PRETOR-PINNEY: Well, you know, there are a lot of distractions (laughter). And in fact, there are probably more distractions these days than there've ever been. You know, you never stick on anything for long. And so I talk about cloud spotting being something that legitimizes doing nothing. And I had this the other day before a talk. I was kind of nervous. And I stepped outside and walked along, and then I saw a hummingbird come along and take some nectar from the blossom of a tree in front of me. And I just sort of locked on that and looked at it for a moment, and that was kind of enough to sort of center me. It's the same thing with - with clouds. I find that sometimes by paying attention to something outside of yourself is just enough for you to kind of find yourself centered again. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)PRETOR-PINNEY: Clouds are not something to moan about, far from it. They are in fact the most diverse, evocative, poetic aspect of nature. I think if you live with your head in the clouds every now and then, it helps you keep your feet on the ground. And I want to show you why. And it's the cirrus cloud named after the Latin for a lock of hair. It's composed entirely of ice crystals cascading from the upper reaches of the troposphere. And as these as crystals fall, they pass through different layers with different winds. And they speed up and slow down, giving the cloud these brushstroked appearances - these brushstroke forms known as full streaks. And these winds up there can be very, very fierce. They can be 200 miles an hour - 300 miles an hour. These clouds are bombing along, but from all the way down here, they appear to be moving gracefully - slowly - like most clouds. And so to tune into the clouds is to slow down, to calm down. And it's like a bit of everyday meditation. We need to be reminded that slowing down and being in the present - not thinking about what you've got to do and what you should have done, but just being here, letting your imagination lift from the everyday concerns down here and just being in the present. It's good for you. It's good for your ideas. It's good for your creativity. It's good for your soul. Thank you very much. (APPLAUSE)RAZ: Cloud spotter Gavin Pretor-Pinney. You can see his full talk at ted. npr. org. By the way, Gavin, where's the best place to look at clouds? PRETOR-PINNEY: The best place to go cloud spotting is in your backyard. RAZ: Oh. OK. PRETOR-PINNEY: Clouds are the most egalitarian of nature's displays 'cause we all have a great view of the sky. And you don't have to go somewhere special to see them. You can - if you're in the right frame of mind - if you're paying attention to the sky, you will be able to see interesting, unusual, exotic formations wherever you are.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)STEVE BALLMER: (Screaming). RAZ: This is a slightly infamous clip of former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer, who we can safely say gets a lot of his energy from being around other people. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BALLMER: I have four words for you. I - love - this - company. (Screaming) Yes. RAZ: Another famous extrovert, Bill Clinton. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON: Tell me how it's affected you again. You know people who lost their job and lost their homes. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: Well, yeah. CLINTON: Well, I've been governor of a small state for 12 years. I'll tell you how it's affected me. RAZ: Lots and lots of celebrities and entertainers are extroverts. They're outspoken, confident, charismatic. Surely you remember the late Joan Rivers. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: What does your grandson want to do when he grows up? Does he know yet? JOAN RIVERS: Right now, he's 10. He wants to be a football player but, you know, stupid. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: What do you want him to be? RIVERS: Gay. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: You want him to be gay? RIVERS: I want him to be gay. I want him to be gay. Who else is going to give a damn that I knew Judy Garland? (LAUGHTER)SUSAN CAIN: So to me the question is, why do we celebrate only that? Or why do we value that so much more highly than the opposite set of traits? RAZ: This is Susan Cain. She has written a book all about introverts. CAIN: Because, you know, I think people need to realize, like, we're not talking about some tiny percent of the population. We're talking about probably half of humanity, according to the most recent study. RAZ: That's crazy. CAIN: Yeah, and so it just makes no sense for anybody really to be undervaluing this way of being. RAZ: Susan says as a culture, we place a higher value on extroverts in all sorts of ways. But why do we do that? Here is her explanation from the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)CAIN: One answer lies deep in our cultural history. Western societies, and in particular the U. S. , have always favored the man of action over the man of contemplation. But in America's early days, we lived in what historians call a culture of character where we still at that point valued people for their inner selves and their moral rectitude. And if you look at the self-help books from this era, they all had titles with things like \"CHARACTER: The Grandest Thing In The World. \" And they featured role models like Abraham Lincoln who was praised for being modest and unassuming. Ralph Waldo Emerson called him a man who does not offend by superiority. But then we hit the 20th century, and we entered a new culture that historians call the culture of personality. You know, what happened is we had evolved from an agricultural economy to a world of big business. And so suddenly, people are moving from small towns to the cities. And instead of working alongside people they've known all their life, now they are having to prove themselves in a crowd of strangers. So quite understandably qualities like magnetism and charisma suddenly come to seem really important. And sure enough the self-help books changed to meet these needs. And they start to have had names like \"How To Win Friends And Influence People. \" And they feature, as their role models, really great salesmen. So that's the world we're living in today. That's our cultural inheritance. RAZ: Which brings us back to the idea of quiet. Earlier, we mentioned this idea that being introverted means you get a lot of your energy from being alone. And Susan Cain says that's actually a good way to think about it. But there's actually a biological explanation behind all of this as well. CAIN: Which is to say that introverts have nervous systems literally that react more to stimulation of all kinds - from social stimulation to the stimulation of lots of noise in a room. RAZ: And scientists have researched this. There was one study in particular. CAIN: By a psychologist named Russell Geen. RAZ: And Geen gave two groups of people a series of math problems. But then he switched on some background noise. So for one group, it sounded a little bit like this. . . (SOUNDBITE OF RESTAURANT)RAZ: . . . About as loud as a restaurant at lunch time. But for the second group. . . (SOUNDBITE OF LEAF BLOWER)RAZ: . . . They had to solve their math problems with noise about as loud as a leaf blower behind them. So when Geen compared his results. . . CAIN: He found that the extroverts were able to do well with the background noise playing more loudly. And the introverts need less background noise to work at their best. RAZ: Now, we think of introverts as sort of being stuck in their own heads simply because they're quiet. But what Geen's research showed was precisely the opposite - that introverts are susceptible to being pulled out of their own heads pretty easily. And they can become overwhelmed and distracted by too much stimulation in noisy or crowded places. CAIN: And extroverts tend to have nervous systems that react less, and therefore, crave more stimulation in order to feel kind of at their most alive and energized. And I think that's really profound research, you know, for thinking about how we are children and adults, you know, all humans thrive. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)CAIN: Our most important institutions - our schools and our workplaces - they are designed mostly for extroverts and for extroverts' need for lots of stimulation. Nowadays, your typical classroom has pods of desks and four or five or six or seven kids all facing each other. And kids are working in countless group assignments, even in subjects like math and creative writing, which you would think would depend on solo flights of thought. Kids are now expected to act as committee members. Same thing is true in our workplaces. We now - most of us work in open-plan offices without walls where we are subject to the constant noise and gaze of our coworkers. And when it comes to leadership, introverts are routinely passed over for leadership positions even though introverts tend to be very careful - much less likely to take outside risks, which is something we might all favor nowadays. What I'm saying is that, culturally we need a much better balance. We need more of a yin and yang between these two types. You know, this is especially important when it comes to creativity and to productivity because when psychologists look at the life of the most creative people, what they find are people who are very good at exchanging ideas and advancing ideas, but who also have a serious streak of introversion in them. RAZ: So what's the connection between introverts and, like, creative types? CAIN: Well, some studies show that they're just introverts, and some say they're kind of a mix of introverts and extroverts, where, like, they're extroverted enough that they can get their ideas out there and exchange ideas with other people. But they're introverted enough that they can tolerate the solitude that creativity requires 'cause - I think this is one of the great, great misconceptions of the modern age. This whole idea of collaboration has become such a sacred word and concept. . . RAZ: Yeah. CAIN: . . . That we think that creativity all has to emerge from this very collaborative place. But the same is also true of solitude. You can't really know what you and you alone think unless you are willing to be by yourself for a while. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)CAIN: Now, none of this is to say that social skills are unimportant. And I'm also not calling for the abolishing of teamwork at all. And the problems that we are facing today in fields like science and economics are so vast and so complex that we are going to need armies of people coming together to solve them - working together. But I am saying that the more freedom that we give introverts to be themselves, the more likely that they are to come up with their own unique solutions to these problems. So I wish you the best of all possible journeys and the courage to speak softly. Thank you very much. (APPLAUSE)RAZ: Susan Cain, her book based on these ideas is called \"Quiet: The Power Of Introverts. \" You can see her full talk at ted. npr. org. I'm Guy Raz, more ideas about quiet in a moment. You are listening to the TED Radio Hour from NPR.

CLINTON: Well, I've been governor of a small state for 12 years. I'll tell you how it's affected me. RAZ: Lots and lots of celebrities and entertainers are extroverts. They're outspoken, confident, charismatic. Surely you remember the late Joan Rivers. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: What does your grandson want to do when he grows up? Does he know yet? JOAN RIVERS: Right now, he's 10. He wants to be a football player but, you know, stupid. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: What do you want him to be? RIVERS: Gay. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: You want him to be gay? RIVERS: I want him to be gay. I want him to be gay. Who else is going to give a damn that I knew Judy Garland? (LAUGHTER) SUSAN CAIN: So to me the question is, why do we celebrate only that? Or why do we value that so much more highly than the opposite set of traits? RAZ: This is Susan Cain. She has written a book all about introverts. CAIN: Because, you know, I think people need to realize, like, we're not talking about some tiny percent of the population. We're talking about probably half of humanity, according to the most recent study. RAZ: That's crazy. CAIN: Yeah, and so it just makes no sense for anybody really to be undervaluing this way of being. RAZ: Susan says as a culture, we place a higher value on extroverts in all sorts of ways. But why do we do that? Here is her explanation from the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) CAIN: One answer lies deep in our cultural history. Western societies, and in particular the U. S. , have always favored the man of action over the man of contemplation. But in America's early days, we lived in what historians call a culture of character where we still at that point valued people for their inner selves and their moral rectitude. And if you look at the self-help books from this era, they all had titles with things like \"CHARACTER: The Grandest Thing In The World. \" And they featured role models like Abraham Lincoln who was praised for being modest and unassuming. Ralph Waldo Emerson called him a man who does not offend by superiority. But then we hit the 20th century, and we entered a new culture that historians call the culture of personality. You know, what happened is we had evolved from an agricultural economy to a world of big business. And so suddenly, people are moving from small towns to the cities. And instead of working alongside people they've known all their life, now they are having to prove themselves in a crowd of strangers. So quite understandably qualities like magnetism and charisma suddenly come to seem really important. And sure enough the self-help books changed to meet these needs. And they start to have had names like \"How To Win Friends And Influence People. \" And they feature, as their role models, really great salesmen. So that's the world we're living in today. That's our cultural inheritance. RAZ: Which brings us back to the idea of quiet. Earlier, we mentioned this idea that being introverted means you get a lot of your energy from being alone. And Susan Cain says that's actually a good way to think about it. But there's actually a biological explanation behind all of this as well. CAIN: Which is to say that introverts have nervous systems literally that react more to stimulation of all kinds - from social stimulation to the stimulation of lots of noise in a room. RAZ: And scientists have researched this. There was one study in particular. CAIN: By a psychologist named Russell Geen. RAZ: And Geen gave two groups of people a series of math problems. But then he switched on some background noise. So for one group, it sounded a little bit like this. . . (SOUNDBITE OF RESTAURANT) RAZ: . . . About as loud as a restaurant at lunch time. But for the second group. . . (SOUNDBITE OF LEAF BLOWER) RAZ: . . . They had to solve their math problems with noise about as loud as a leaf blower behind them. So when Geen compared his results. . . CAIN: He found that the extroverts were able to do well with the background noise playing more loudly. And the introverts need less background noise to work at their best. RAZ: Now, we think of introverts as sort of being stuck in their own heads simply because they're quiet. But what Geen's research showed was precisely the opposite - that introverts are susceptible to being pulled out of their own heads pretty easily. And they can become overwhelmed and distracted by too much stimulation in noisy or crowded places. CAIN: And extroverts tend to have nervous systems that react less, and therefore, crave more stimulation in order to feel kind of at their most alive and energized. And I think that's really profound research, you know, for thinking about how we are children and adults, you know, all humans thrive. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) CAIN: Our most important institutions - our schools and our workplaces - they are designed mostly for extroverts and for extroverts' need for lots of stimulation. Nowadays, your typical classroom has pods of desks and four or five or six or seven kids all facing each other. And kids are working in countless group assignments, even in subjects like math and creative writing, which you would think would depend on solo flights of thought. Kids are now expected to act as committee members. Same thing is true in our workplaces. We now - most of us work in open-plan offices without walls where we are subject to the constant noise and gaze of our coworkers. And when it comes to leadership, introverts are routinely passed over for leadership positions even though introverts tend to be very careful - much less likely to take outside risks, which is something we might all favor nowadays. What I'm saying is that, culturally we need a much better balance. We need more of a yin and yang between these two types. You know, this is especially important when it comes to creativity and to productivity because when psychologists look at the life of the most creative people, what they find are people who are very good at exchanging ideas and advancing ideas, but who also have a serious streak of introversion in them. RAZ: So what's the connection between introverts and, like, creative types? CAIN: Well, some studies show that they're just introverts, and some say they're kind of a mix of introverts and extroverts, where, like, they're extroverted enough that they can get their ideas out there and exchange ideas with other people. But they're introverted enough that they can tolerate the solitude that creativity requires 'cause - I think this is one of the great, great misconceptions of the modern age. This whole idea of collaboration has become such a sacred word and concept. . . RAZ: Yeah. CAIN: . . . That we think that creativity all has to emerge from this very collaborative place. But the same is also true of solitude. You can't really know what you and you alone think unless you are willing to be by yourself for a while. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) CAIN: Now, none of this is to say that social skills are unimportant. And I'm also not calling for the abolishing of teamwork at all. And the problems that we are facing today in fields like science and economics are so vast and so complex that we are going to need armies of people coming together to solve them - working together. But I am saying that the more freedom that we give introverts to be themselves, the more likely that they are to come up with their own unique solutions to these problems. So I wish you the best of all possible journeys and the courage to speak softly. Thank you very much. (APPLAUSE) RAZ: Susan Cain, her book based on these ideas is called \"Quiet: The Power Of Introverts. \" You can see her full talk at ted. npr. org. I'm Guy Raz, more ideas about quiet in a moment.

PICO IYER: (Laughter) I was born on a plane almost. It feels like that. RAZ: Pico's a writer and a journalist, and he does this for a living. He travels all over the world, and he writes about his travels. And in some ways, Pico's been in motion his entire life. IYER: I was born in Oxford, England, to parents from India. And then when I was 7, we moved to California. So suddenly I was a part of three different places. And then I began going back to school in England while my parents were living in California when I was 9. So, yes, I think I very quickly got into the sense that motion was my second nature. RAZ: And when Pico grew up, that's exactly the kind of life he created for himself. IYER: I remembered when I was in my 20s in the middle of this very fast-paced life in New York City - got to take wonderful vacations in Barli and Burma and El Salvador and writing on world affairs and really interesting friends, and I felt I was right in the middle of the moment. And yet, I realized that I had so created my life that I didn't have enough minutes in the day to work out if this was really making me happy, and so I thought, I need to stop right now and go to a very clear environment and then take stock of things. RAZ: So Pico decided to go somewhere else - somewhere completely new where occasionally, he could just sit still. He tells the rest of the story from the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)IYER: And so I abandoned my dream life for a single room on the back streets of Kyoto, Japan, which was the place that had long exerted a strong, really mysterious gravitational pull on me. Even as a child, I would just look at a painting of Kyoto and feel I recognized it. I knew it before I ever laid eyes on it. But it's also, as you all know, a beautiful city encircled by hills filled with more than 2,000 temples and shrines where people have been sitting still for 800 years or more. And quite soon after I moved there, I ended up where I still am with my wife, formerly, our kids in a two-room apartment in the middle of nowhere where we have no bicycle, no car, no TV. I can understand. So clearly, this is not ideal for job advancement or for cultural excitement or for social diversion. But I realized that it gives me what I prize most, which is days and hours. Every morning when I wake up, really the day stretches in front of me like an open meadow. And so I made that move 27 years ago, and I can honestly say it's one of the choices in my life I have never regretted. RAZ: But, I mean, even hearing you say that, I think a lot of people would say, this is a privilege, right? Like - I mean, do you think that's true? IYER: It is, but not as much as we sometimes think it is. And it's interesting because, for example, a couple of years ago, I went to see my doctor, and he looked at my chart. And he said, you're pretty healthy, but you must take exercise 30 minutes a day. And as soon as he said that, I signed up at a health club, and I go every day of my life. But when somebody says, you should take 30 minutes being quiet everyday -  going to the mental health club ensuring that your imagination and mind and spirit are as healthy as your body. I'd say, oh, no, I don't have time to sit in a corner for 30 minutes or take a walk or unplug. And yet, that's much more fundamental, I would say, to my well-being and my overall health than walking the treadmill. So I think we're getting caught up in an accelerating world that's moving faster and faster almost at the speed of a machine more than a human, and we're getting out of breath. There's no way we can keep up with that. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)IYER: And of course, sitting still is how many of us get what we most crave and need in our accelerated lives - a break. But it was also the only way that I could find to sift through the slideshow of my experience and make sense of the future and the past. And so, to my great surprise, I found that going nowhere was at least as exciting as going to Tibet or to Cuba. And by going nowhere, I mean nothing more intimidating than taking a few minutes out of every day or a few days out of every season in order to sit still long enough to find out what moves you most to recall where your truest happiness lies and to remember that sometimes making a living and making a life point in opposite directions. And of course this is what wise beings through the centuries from every tradition have been telling us. It's an old idea. More than 2,000 years ago, the Stoics were reminding us, it's not our experience that makes our lives; it's what we do with it. And this has certainly been my experience as a traveler. Twenty-four years ago, I took the most mind-bending trip across North Korea. But the trip lasted a few days. What I've done with it - sitting still going back to it in my head, trying to understand it, finding a place for it in my thinking - that's lasted 24 years already and will probably last a lifetime. The trip, in other words, gave me some amazing sights, but it's only sitting still that allows me to turn those into lasting insights. RAZ: How do you do it? I mean, is there a room? Is there a chair? Is there a place or a way that you find that? IYER: Well, I'm lucky because, of course as a writer, I'm obliged to sit for maybe three weeks in one place at my little desk. And I think in some ways, that's where so much of my life takes place because we all know that experiences are, as it were, the raw material of our life, but it's what we do with them that is our life itself. That's the heart of our experience, not the things that happened to us, but how we have responded to them. And so I always think the fundamental moments in life come when suddenly you lose love or suddenly somebody close to you gets a terrible diagnosis or when you get a terrible diagnosis. And I feel that when I visit my doctor and he comes into the room with a very dark expression on his face, the thing that's going to help me there is the moments when I've been still and when I've collected myself, not the moments when I've been running around to Easter Island or Bhutan or even, you know, walking through Time Square. It's in stillness that we prepare ourselves for dealing with the realities of life, which are often very difficult ones. RAZ: I mean, the thing about stillness is that your head can be a very loud place, especially, if things in your life are difficult or if there's anxiety or other things happening. Like, how do you clear that out to make that space to get to stillness? IYER: I think you clear the anxiety by sitting still and addressing it and seeing it come and go in some ways. But you're absolutely right. When I go and sit still at my desk as a writer for five hours every day, often those hours are agonizing. They're torture, and I think a monk would tell you that a large part of the time he spends alone in his cell is spent with doubt and darkness. But running around is never going to address those feelings very well. It's only going to evade them. And I think actually one of the things that you find if you sit still is those feelings of anxiety and all the sufferings and pains that every one of us know fall into a kind proportion. RAZ: In your talk, you mentioned that only by slowing down, can we see that sometimes making a living and making a life point in different directions. IYER: Yes, I think that's really why I left New York City in a nutshell because I felt making a living was not the same thing as making a life. And I was making a nice-enough living then and very comfortable, but that wasn't a life. And we all know on our deathbed when somebody says to you, what made your life fulfilling? Our job will be part of it, but it certainly won't be all of it. And answering emails and scrolling through YouTube will be a small part of it, but there are other things that are probably going to be much more at the heart of what we're glad to have done. And they will probably have to do with our relationships, moments of quiet, our explorations, but certainly, much more to do with the invisible part of our life, I would say, than the visible. And I think that's where it's easy to ignore that invisible bank account in the same way it's easy to ignore the mental health club. And yet, the invisible bank account is what's making you rich, and the mental health club is what's making you healthy. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)IYER: And I think many of us have the sensation - I certainly do - that we're standing about two inches away from a huge screen. And it's noisy, and it's crowded. And it's changing with every second. And that screen is our lives. And it's only by stepping back and then further back and holding still that we can begin to see what the canvas means and to catch the larger picture. So in an age of acceleration, nothing can be more exhilarating than going slow. And in an age of distraction, nothing is so luxurious as paying attention. And in an age of constant movement, nothing is so urgent as sitting still. Thank you. (APPLAUSE)RAZ: Writer and traveler Pico Iyer. He's the author of a newly released TED book.

If you try to push two sides with the same charge together, they put up a fight. Well, Raymond Colello wants to put those forces to use in football helmets. Colello is a researcher at Virginia Commonwealth University, and he's a football fan. And he knows that there is only so much that traditional helmets can do to stem concussions on the field. So one day, about a year ago, as he was watching a Denver Broncos game, he had a classic a-ha moment in the wake of the big hit on star receiver Wes Welker. RAYMOND COLELLO: You know, at that point, I was thinking, wow, they really need a force field around their heads of some sort. And at that time, I walked back to my refrigerator for maybe one more drink. And I happened to see the refrigerator door, and on top of it was a lot of the art of my children. VIGELAND: (Laughter). COLELLO: All of the sudden, it came to me. VIGELAND: All right, well, explain how this might work. COLELLO: What the magnets would do is really introduce a break on the system before the collision takes place, you know, very similar to - imagine a guy driving a car running into a wall at 30 miles an hour. He's going to expose himself to a certain amount of impact forces. Imagine that same gentleman driving his car at 30 miles an hour into a well, but just before he hits it, he jams on the brakes. He's still going to hit the wall, but it's going to stretch out the time in which the collision occurs. And that's where we're going to get a real change in G-forces that his body will experience. VIGELAND: I know the fluid around the brain protects it from a certain amount of jostling. The helmet, of course, protects it even further. But what have you found in your experiments with magnetized helmets? COLELLO: First of all, you know, when you think about the players that play - for example, Chris Johnson. . . VIGELAND: One of the faster players in the NFL. COLELLO: One of the fastest runners - you know, he can run up to 20 miles an hour. And if he gets hit in the open playing field, the forces are quite staggering, and what we're talking about is a change of acceleration. The impact time will take only 12 milliseconds, and he'll experience 120 Gs of force. Now, if you can actually extend that time to, say, 17 milliseconds, you can shift the G-forces down to 88. We're not going to be able to change his velocity. He's going as fast as he can go. But we might be able to extend the time at which that impact takes place. What we found in laboratory experiments - a 60-G impact would be shifted down to about 20, 25 Gs. An 80-G impact will be shifted down to about 40, 45. And a 120-G impact, which is - concussions readily occur at 100 Gs. A 120 impact would be shifted down to about 88 Gs. VIGELAND: You know, magnets are used in medicine for imaging all the time. But I wonder if there's any other existing technology that will tell you whether it is OK for people to put magnets this close to their skulls for three or more hours at a time. COLELLO: You're absolutely right. I think our closest analogy, really, we have is MRIs. These magnets that we have are producing field strengths that are only two percent or one percent of what you would see if you're exposed to a magnet in an MRI. VIGELAND: OK. Now, it sounds like you're pretty early in the research stage here. What happens next? COLELLO: We're trying to make a specific type of magnet that would be arc in nature so that it would fit right within the inside of the polycarbonate shell of the helmet. And these have to be specially designed and manufactured. What we're doing then is we're going to be using the Hybrid II head forms that normally you've seen in crash test dummies. They have accelerometers placed within the head. In fact, we're going to be using a zip line to run two helmets towards each other and then getting that data to determine what kind of forces have been reduced or how the forces have changed upon impact. Once we get that data, then we'll know when and how to proceed to field conditions. VIGELAND: Raymond Colello is an associate professor of anatomy and neurobiology at Virginia Commonwealth University. Thank you. It's fascinating. COLELLO: Well, thank you, Tess. Really appreciate it. TESS VIGELAND, HOST:  You remember toying around with magnets when you were a kid, right? If you try to push two sides with the same charge together, they put up a fight. Well, Raymond Colello wants to put those forces to use in football helmets. Colello is a researcher at Virginia Commonwealth University, and he's a football fan. And he knows that there is only so much that traditional helmets can do to stem concussions on the field. So one day, about a year ago, as he was watching a Denver Broncos game, he had a classic a-ha moment in the wake of the big hit on star receiver Wes Welker. RAYMOND COLELLO: You know, at that point, I was thinking, wow, they really need a force field around their heads of some sort. And at that time, I walked back to my refrigerator for maybe one more drink. And I happened to see the refrigerator door, and on top of it was a lot of the art of my children. VIGELAND: (Laughter). COLELLO: All of the sudden, it came to me. VIGELAND: All right, well, explain how this might work. COLELLO: What the magnets would do is really introduce a break on the system before the collision takes place, you know, very similar to - imagine a guy driving a car running into a wall at 30 miles an hour. He's going to expose himself to a certain amount of impact forces. Imagine that same gentleman driving his car at 30 miles an hour into a well, but just before he hits it, he jams on the brakes. He's still going to hit the wall, but it's going to stretch out the time in which the collision occurs. And that's where we're going to get a real change in G-forces that his body will experience. VIGELAND: I know the fluid around the brain protects it from a certain amount of jostling. The helmet, of course, protects it even further. But what have you found in your experiments with magnetized helmets? COLELLO: First of all, you know, when you think about the players that play - for example, Chris Johnson. . . VIGELAND: One of the faster players in the NFL. COLELLO: One of the fastest runners - you know, he can run up to 20 miles an hour. And if he gets hit in the open playing field, the forces are quite staggering, and what we're talking about is a change of acceleration. The impact time will take only 12 milliseconds, and he'll experience 120 Gs of force. Now, if you can actually extend that time to, say, 17 milliseconds, you can shift the G-forces down to 88. We're not going to be able to change his velocity. He's going as fast as he can go. But we might be able to extend the time at which that impact takes place. What we found in laboratory experiments - a 60-G impact would be shifted down to about 20, 25 Gs. An 80-G impact will be shifted down to about 40, 45. And a 120-G impact, which is - concussions readily occur at 100 Gs. A 120 impact would be shifted down to about 88 Gs. VIGELAND: You know, magnets are used in medicine for imaging all the time. But I wonder if there's any other existing technology that will tell you whether it is OK for people to put magnets this close to their skulls for three or more hours at a time. COLELLO: You're absolutely right. I think our closest analogy, really, we have is MRIs. These magnets that we have are producing field strengths that are only two percent or one percent of what you would see if you're exposed to a magnet in an MRI. VIGELAND: OK. Now, it sounds like you're pretty early in the research stage here. What happens next?

But new research suggests altruism may be hardwired in the brain. Reporter Michelle Trudeau has more. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)MICHELLE TRUDEAU, BYLINE: Altruism is when you help somebody else at a cost to yourself. So you're sacrificing for another; you're taking a risk or suffering pain. ANGELA SIMPSON: My name is Angela Simpson. I reside in Albany, New York, and I am 46 years old. TRUDEAU: Angela is a graphic artist. She is also an extraordinary altruist. Back in 2010, Angela donated one of her kidneys to an unknown recipient. SIMPSON: The only thing I knew about my recipient is that she was a female and she was residing in Bakersfield, California. TRUDEAU: The surgery to remove Angela's kidney occurred at a transplant hospital in New York City. SIMPSON: And my kidney was shipped to California immediately after it was extracted. TRUDEAU: Angela's altruistic act begs the question why would someone donate a perfectly healthy part of their body to a total stranger, go through the risk of major surgery and do it willingly - even happily - for no pay, no remuneration and anonymously? Here's how Angela explains her decision. SIMPSON: At that time in my life, I was 42 years old. I was very single. I had no children; you know, very, very fortunate - loved my life. But I really felt like I would question often what is my purpose? TRUDEAU: So when she heard about the critical need for kidney donations - over 100,000 people in the U. S. today are waiting for a kidney transplant. . . SIMPSON: To really be able to help somebody unconditionally was, like, an awe moment. TRUDEAU: So she did it, she says, simply because she could. Professor Abigail Marsh has her own story of altruism, too. ABIGAIL MARSH: I think I was 20 years old, and I was driving home to my parent's house in Tacoma, Washington. TRUDEAU: Long story short - a freak highway accident. Her car spins around and stalls in the fast lane. A stranger stops, dodges through traffic, helps her to safety saving her life and then disappears. A true altruist - risking his own life to help someone he didn't know and would never see again. This propelled Abigail Marsh toward her professional career, one of today's leading researchers of altruism. Now at Georgetown University, Marsh studies what she calls extraordinary altruists - most recently, a study of 19, including Angela, from around the country who donated a kidney to a stranger. MARSH: And we brought them to Georgetown for testing. TRUDEAU: Psych testing, brain imaging studies, extensive background profiles, etc. But, says Marsh. . . MARSH: Most of the test that we did didn't show any differences between the altruistic donors and people who had not been donors. TRUDEAU: All pretty normal - except for a telltale difference in a part of our brain called the amygdala. It's an almond-shaped cluster of nerves; it's our emotional radar. And it was significantly larger in altruists compared to those who'd never donated an organ. Additionally, Marsh reports that the amygdala in altruists is supersensitive to fear or distress in another's face. MARSH: They showed this very specific increase in amygdala activation in response to others' fear. TRUDEAU: Now in previous research, Marsh reports some polar opposite findings in a group of psychopaths. Using the same tests as with the altruists, Marsh found that psychopaths have smaller, less active amygdalas. The brains' emotional radar in psychopaths was blunted and relatively unresponsive to someone else's distress or fear. For NPR News, I'm Michelle Trudeau.

She's known in science circles as the Queen of Carbon, but she's a little more modest. MILDRED DRESSELHAUS: Most people call me just by my first name, Millie (laughter). CORNISH: Millie is Mildred Dresselhaus. She's 84 and a professor of physics and electrical engineering at MIT. She got her nickname because much of her life's work has focused on the properties of carbon. Her research has paved the way for the rise of nanotechnology. Dresselhaus grew up in the Bronx, New York and attended public school through junior high. She said she was 13 when she realized she could be getting more out of her education. Dresselhaus transferred to Hunter College High School, one of the top preparatory schools in the country, after passing the entrance exams and acing the math portion. DRESSELHAUS: It didn't take very long to catch up with math. That was easy and all the other classes were more difficult so I'd figured that was where my talents were. CORNISH: She figured right. She credits part of her success to the teachings of physicist Enrico Fermi, whom she met as a graduate student at the University of Chicago. DRESSELHAUS: It was just brilliance and clarity. That was, I would say the bottom line. In his class, nobody took notes. He didn't allow that. You had to listen to him. CORNISH: Dresselhaus says she walked the same route to the laboratory on campus as Fermi did. DRESSELHAUS: He was an early riser and I was an early riser so we both were walking at about the same time and he recognized me and would come across the street and walk with me - so that was my introduction to science. Amazing, isn't it? CORNISH: Since then, Dresselhaus gone on to win several prestigious awards, including the Enrico Fermi award in 2012 named after her mentor and professor and the National Medal of Science in 1990. Her scientific breakthroughs came as she and her husband Gene raised four children and she told us it was her husband, a fellow physicist, who helped make it possible. She says he encouraged her when others didn't. DRESSELHAUS: Having a career and family is not uncommon, but at that time, having a full-time job - and a demanding job - that was kind of unusual. CORNISH: What has been in your advice to young women entering these fields today? DRESSELHAUS: Well, I think that entering the field of science is really almost the best career they can have. And what's the reason for it? There are two reasons. One, the work is very interesting and secondly, you're judged by what you do and not what you look like and I think that that is a very important thing for women in science. The sad thing is that so few women choose it because there aren't so many of us and they don't like to be outnumbered by the men. CORNISH: Looking back on your research with this award - the Presidential Medal of Freedom - what would you like your legacy to be as a scientist, or even as a woman scientist? DRESSELHAUS: Well, I don't really think of my legacy. I'm still working and not thinking about my legacy. I just passed my 84th birthday. Many people at my age retire, but I'm still working and I try to be a good mother and a good grandmother. We have five grandchildren now and I've enjoyed all aspects, and I spent many hours at MIT telling young women that they could do the same.

NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE, BYLINE: If you ask Lesley Gregoricka what she does for a living, she'll say she's a bio-archaeologist. LESLEY GREGORICKA: A bio-archaeologist is someone who examines ancient skeletal remains to learn more about what life was like in the past. GREENFIELDBOYCE: She's got a lab at the University of South Alabama. Normally she does chemical analyses of Bronze Age skeletons to understand patterns of trade and human migration. She never expected she'd veer off into vampire studies. GREGORICKA: Never. I did not think that that would be the direction my career would go. GREENFIELDBOYCE: That's because, of course, vampires are mythical beings who supposedly come back from the dead to suck the blood of the living. Her vampire adventure started because she has a good friend who was doing research on the graveyard in northwestern Poland. This burial site dates back to the 17th and 18th centuries, but was discovered by accident in some farmers' fields outside a village called Dravsko. When archaeologists started excavating the site in 2008, they found something strange. GREGORICKA: What they found in that first year was a burial of an individual that had a sickle placed across their neck. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Researchers believe that villagers put this sharp, curved blade around the corpse's neck as an anti-vampire precaution. GREGORICKA: It was thought that by placing the sickle across the neck, if the deceased did indeed transform into a vampire and attempt to rise from the grave, that the sharp blade of this instrument would remove the head and prevent that person from attacking the living. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Archaeologists have found other grave sites in Europe where bodies have been given some kind of anti-vampire treatment. GREGORICKA: Some have actually iron stakes driven through the left side of the chest. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Others have rocks placed beneath the jaw to prevent the dead from biting the living. But a sickle is really unusual. At Dravsko, scientists have unearthed over 300 graves and found five skeletons with sickles around the neck or abdomen. Gregoricka says she was intrigued. For the people who buried all these bodies, what marked those few as potential vampires? GREGORICKA: That is the question, and that's what we wanted to figure out as bio-archaeologists; what could the skeleton tell us? GREENFIELDBOYCE: What the historical records them was that people were suspect if they hadn't been baptized or were the first person to die in an epidemic. But she and her colleagues wondered if other social forces might be at work. They knew that during this period, this region had seen the arrival of lots of immigrants. GREGORICKA: We hypothesized that those individuals buried as vampires were targeted because of their outsider status as nonlocal immigrants. GREENFIELDBOYCE: And this was something she could test for in her lab. She collected teeth from 60 of the skeletons, including ones that had gotten the anti-vampire treatment. Then she did an analysis of the dental enamel. She looked at different types, or isotopes, of the element strontium. GREGORICKA: Strontium isotope values are determined by local geology, and this is going to vary from place to place. GREENFIELDBOYCE: The results, which appear in the journal PLoS ONE, let her distinguished locals from recent arrivals, and as it turns out. . . GREGORICKA: Contrary to our hypothesis, all of the vampires were local. We found others in the cemetery that were nonlocal to the region, but they were not buried as vampires. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Gregoricka says they'll keep doing more chemistry with these bones to see if they can find any difference that might explain why those five people were buried under a sickle.

This is really, really weird. WESTERVELT: That, of course, is Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen. They're two of the million super-cute extra babies born between 1981 and 2012, all of whom might be hurting the economy. Here's NPR's Rebecca Hersher. REBECCA HERSHER, BYLINE: Let's get one thing out of the way first. Everyone in this story loves twins - even this guy. MARK ROSENZWEIG: Well, basically, we would prefer that people were not twins to being twins. HERSHER: Mark Rosenzweig is an economist. His career is built on studying twins. But, if he's being honest, he thinks twins are bad economic news. First, there's healthcare costs. Twins are more likely to be born prematurely, which can lead to all kinds of expensive medical problems. And then there's birth weight. He did a study based on hundreds of female twins in Minnesota that looked at the effect of birth weight on lifetime earnings. ROSENZWEIG: The birth weight of twins are, on average, about 28 ounces lower. So the earnings result was 16 percent lower, related to the fact that they had lower birth weight. HERSHER: Yeah, you heard that right. On average, girl twins make 16 percent less money over their lifetimes, just because they're born less chubby. Unless you think it's only the girls who are a problem. Multiple studies have also found low birth weight correlates with less educational success in boys, which also means earning less money. And then there's the stress on a family of bringing home two babies at once. Here's another person who loves twins. NANCY SEGAL: As a twin researcher, of course, I want lots of twins in the population. HERSHER: Nancy Segal runs that Twin Studies Center at Cal State Fullerton. SEGAL: The birth of twins - it's usually greeted with a great deal of shock. A two-person stroller, two cribs, two of everything, basically. HERSHER: Double the carpools, double the college payments - raising all those extra millennial twins has been hard on family budgets, plus the cost of having them in the first place. The main reason for the twin-boom in the '90s was a new, expensive technology called in vitro fertilization which, in its early days, frequently produced twins, triplets and more. But despite the costs, Segal doesn't buy that twins are a bad thing for society. She points out twins tend to support each other emotionally and tend to live closer to each other and to family than regular siblings, which could make them more available to care for aging parents. And being twins might just help them economically, too. MATT GRADNANI: I'm Matt Gradnani. MIKE GRADNANI: I'm Mike Gradnani, and we are both 25 years old. HERSHER: The Gradnanis are identical twins, and they're really, really close. They went to college together, played football and rugby together. They go to bars together, but they're not into the same kinds of women, if you were wondering. And, at 25 years old, they live together in an apartment they own together, which they could afford because there are two of them. MIKE GRADNANI: I mean, we both kind of felt that it'd be smarter in the long run to put money in our own investment instead of someone else's pocket. And, ultimately, the two of us could afford a lot more space together than we could individually. So. . . MATT GRADNANI: It's our hometown. MIKE GRADNANI: It's our hometown that we grew up in. HERSHER: And Mike and Matt even co-own a successful business selling real estate. How is that for hurting the economy? They are just two of the 1 million extra millennial twins entering the workforce right now and starting families of their own in the coming years. The ultimate economic impact of all those twins is yet to be known. Rebecca Hersher, NPR News. ERIC WESTERVELT, HOST:  There are more twins in the millennial generation than any other generation, which was pretty obvious if you turned on the TV in the '90s when millennials were growing up. (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"IT TAKES TWO\") ASHLEY OLSEN: (As Alyssa Callaway) Wow, there really is two of us. Don't you find this odd? MARY-KATE OLSEN: (As Amanda Lemmon) No. This is weird. This is really, really weird. WESTERVELT: That, of course, is Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen. They're two of the million super-cute extra babies born between 1981 and 2012, all of whom might be hurting the economy. Here's NPR's Rebecca Hersher. REBECCA HERSHER, BYLINE: Let's get one thing out of the way first. Everyone in this story loves twins - even this guy. MARK ROSENZWEIG: Well, basically, we would prefer that people were not twins to being twins. HERSHER: Mark Rosenzweig is an economist. His career is built on studying twins. But, if he's being honest, he thinks twins are bad economic news. First, there's healthcare costs. Twins are more likely to be born prematurely, which can lead to all kinds of expensive medical problems. And then there's birth weight. He did a study based on hundreds of female twins in Minnesota that looked at the effect of birth weight on lifetime earnings. ROSENZWEIG: The birth weight of twins are, on average, about 28 ounces lower. So the earnings result was 16 percent lower, related to the fact that they had lower birth weight. HERSHER: Yeah, you heard that right. On average, girl twins make 16 percent less money over their lifetimes, just because they're born less chubby. Unless you think it's only the girls who are a problem. Multiple studies have also found low birth weight correlates with less educational success in boys, which also means earning less money.

This next story is about a surprise find in one collection that's been sitting around for more than a century. It's an ancient mussel shell and NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce reports strange markings on the shell may tell us something about the evolution of our species. NELL GREENFIELDBOYCE: Back in the late 19th century, the idea that humans had evolved was pretty radical. It fascinated a Dutch physician named Eugene Dubois. In 1891, he was digging for fossils on the island of Java in Indonesia. JOSEPHINE JOORDENS: To try and find what he called the missing link between apes and modern humans. GREENFIELDBOYCE: That's Josephine Joordens of Leiden University in the Netherlands. She says Dubois did find the bones of an apelike creature that walked upright - the first example of Homo erecuts, an extinct human species that lived long before modern humans. It's a famous discovery. Less well-known is that Dubois collected a lot of other stuff from that archaeological site. JOORDENS: Many other animals and plants and, you know, fish and birds and shells. And they've been stored in a museum - Naturalis - now for over a hundred years. GREENFIELDBOYCE: Joordens was looking at the shells because she wanted to understand the environment that those early humans had lived in. A colleague photographed the shells and later in one photo of a big white mussel shell he noticed something odd. JOORDENS: It has a kind of zigzag engraving. So it looks like a pattern that sometimes you still find nowadays on, you know, pottery for decoration. GREENFIELDBOYCE: To Joordens and her colleague, it just didn't make any sense. Homo erectus used tools, but was thought to be too primitive to think abstractly or make symbolic designs. JOORDENS: We looked at it and we thought well, it's kind of strange and maybe some animal made it or it's - I don't know - sands grains or maybe even a fake. GREENFIELDBOYCE: The researchers ended up doing an exhaustive series of studies on this shell and others and came to the conclusion that Homo erectus was actually pretty sophisticated. In the journal \"Nature,\" they say it's clear these early humans had come up with a clever trick to open the shellfish, drilling holes in a particular spot on the shell. They also used one shell to make a scraping tool. What's more, all the evidence suggests that Homo erectus really did engrave that geometric design about half a million years ago. JOORDENS: I find it a very touching find because it's so much similar to what we as humans would make ourselves and that tells you something about this Homo erectus species that we didn't know before. GREENFIELDBOYCE: And it means complex human behaviors, like art, may go back farther than we thought. This is a big claim to make. Alison Brooks is a paleoanthropologist at George Washington University. She says what's previously been accepted as the oldest human engravings were made hundreds of thousands of years later on chunks of ochre and the shells of ostrich eggs. Those designs are much more complicated than the lines on this mussel shell. ALISON BROOKS: Even though it's apparently a zigzag pattern, I think there's going to be some controversy about it. GREENFIELDBOYCE: She says it's possible that Homo erectus made the pattern, but. . . BROOKS: Maybe it's not as intentional a design as they implied. GREENFIELDBOYCE: One person who's extremely skeptical is John Shea, a professor of anthropology at Stony Brook University. JOHN SHEA: If this is symbolic behavior by Homo erectus then it's basically the only evidence we've got for a species that lived for a million-and-a-half years on three continents.

Their former residents have fled because they don't like winter. And it's up to an odd group of landlords to watch over these abandoned places. Move over, Michael Keaton. We're going to meet a different kind of bird man. He invited NPR's Adam Cole to see these special dwellings. ADAM COLE, BYLINE: If you drive around New Zion, South Carolina, you can't miss them. This is a nice place. They typically stand in rows, raised on metal poles and painted white. But they're oddly pear-shaped and only eight inches across. Here we are, another colony. This is a cluster of hollowed-out gourds. It's an apartment complex for purple martins - native North American swallows. They're not purple, exactly - more like a deep metallic blue. At the moment, though, I can't see a single bird. They all flew off to South America months ago. But come spring the martins will be back. And these gourds will be all a-twitter because here's the weird thing about purple martins - on the East Coast, they nest exclusively in human built housing. Sure, they used to breed in tree holes and little nooks in cliffs, but then thousands of years ago Native Americans started putting up hollow gourds for the martins. No one really knows why. Maybe the birds ate pesky bugs or maybe they made good alarm clocks, but, anyway, the birds left the natural world behind. BUBBA JOHNSON: Well, they are probably the happiest birds that you'll ever come in contact with. COLE: Bubba Johnson is one of the thousands of devoted human landlords who are still carrying on that gourd-house tradition. JOHNSON: You can say I'm the bird man. They call me the bird man, and everywhere you see a purple martin pole, I probably had something to do with it. COLE: Johnson is a farmer here in New Zion. He mostly grows cucumbers for pickling, but he also grows gourds for the martins. JOHNSON: I'm at real (unintelligible) love with them if you want to just tell it like it is. COLE: And lucky for them lots of people feel the same way. If they didn't martins would be forced to fend for themselves and nature might not be the most hospitable place for them these days. Why? Well, it may be hard to believe, but one of the major people to blame for this is William Shakespeare. Stay with me - see Shakespeare mentions a lot of birds in his plays. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: It was the nightingale and not the lark. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: I know a hawk from a handsaw. UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: Nay, I'll have a starling shall be taught to speak. COLE: And it's that last one - the starling - that turned into a real problem for purple martins because centuries later in 1890 a New York drug manufacturer had a whimsical idea. Wouldn't it be cool, he thought, if we had every bird mentioned by Shakespeare right here in New York City? So he got a hundred European starlings and released them into Central Park. Over the next century, those birds multiplied into an army that reached from coast to coast. And now they've invaded the natural nest sites where martins used to breed. Even worse they break into martins' human-built houses. That means Bubba Johnson can't just be a landlord. He has to be a security guard. JOHNSON: We've got to install a trap that'll trap the starlings. COLE: And barricades to keep away raccoons and cages to keep away owls and electrified poles to keep away snakes. In fact the purple martins have a whole nationwide network of safe houses. And it seems to be doing its job. Some songbird species are declining, but purple martin numbers have been steady for decades and you can actually see this success in a really dramatic way. Every year in late summer, before they head south, martins gather in enormous roosts, hundreds of thousands of birds fill the sky in swirling, shifting curtains. JOHNSON: It is something to see I'm telling you. A person will not believe it until they see. COLE: I saw it, and he's right. It is incredible. And you can see it too on our science YouTube channel Skunk Bear. By now, all the birds in that video are basking in the Brazilian sun. And back here in South Carolina, landlords like Bubba Johnson are working away repairing old birdhouses, building new ones and waiting for their tenants to return. Adam Cole, NPR News.

This year's meeting runs this weekend and next in Lima, Peru. Recent conferences have produced mixed results at best. But this year, as NPR's Christopher Joyce reports, negotiators say they have some fresh ideas. CHRISTOPHER JOYCE, BYLINE: Some say these conferences of the parties are a warming planet's best hope. Some say they're a United Nations jamboree. The conference in Kyoto, Japan in 1997 was a breakthrough. It produced an international treaty to limit emissions of greenhouse gases. But that treaty failed to slow worldwide emissions. And no one can agree on a new treaty to replace Kyoto. One problem is that the Kyoto limits on emissions only apply to developed countries. But now China, India, Brazil and Indonesia are among the biggest polluters. So in Lima, the new plan on the table requires every country to do something to slow warming. Todd Stern is the U. S. government's climate negotiator. TODD STERN: It's supposed to be applicable to all. And to us - I think to a great many countries - that was an absolutely critical few words because that said to us that we weren't doing Kyoto. JOYCE: In addition to leaving out developing countries, the Kyoto treaty set mandatory emissions reductions that applied for all developed countries. But even some rich countries failed to meet them. So the plan in Lima would have each government offer up its own voluntary target. STERN: And to subject what they're proposing to do to full sunlight, right? So the views of other countries and the press and everybody else can look to see what China, the U. S. or India or Europe or Japan or anybody else is proposing to do. And you take whatever criticism you get. JOYCE: President Obama and President Xi Jinping did the voluntary promise thing two months ago. They set targets for lowering emissions in the U. S. and China over the next 10 to 15 years. But what happens if, when you add up everyone's promises, it isn't enough to keep a lid on warming? Alden Meyer, a climate expert with the Union of Concerned Scientists, is in Peru this week. ALDEN MEYER: Will there be a moment where all those contributions are added up and the world has to confront the reality of what it has put a table if it's not ambitious enough? JOYCE: In fact, pledges so far from the U. S. , China and Europe are not nearly enough to keep the planet from warming to what scientists say will be a dangerous level. Yet many developing countries say they can't do much because their priority is getting their people out of poverty - not limiting greenhouse gases. This is the deep difference that negotiators in Lima hope to resolve in time for the next conference of the parties in Paris next year. And they do have a carrot to offer. Wealthy countries have promised a $100 billion a year to help poorer countries buy the technology they need to lower emissions. There are plenty of businesses making solar panels and wind turbines and energy saving devices for rich countries, and they're eager to sell to the developing world as well. Many are part of the Business Council for Sustainable Energy led by Lisa Jacobson. LISA JACOBSON: Once people start making these investments, they're going to find that they're easier to do than they expected. They're less expensive than they thought - that new jobs and new economic development opportunities exist. And they're going to want to do more. JOYCE: And it's worth noting that at the very first climate conferences, many business leaders came to oppose a treaty. Now they're lining up to profit from one. Christopher Joyce, NPR News.

So this episode is about courage. We've heard from a war correspondent. And we just heard from Kimberley Motley, who represents women in Afghanistan. And now it's your turn. LEANA WEN: I don't think that this is the right show for me. I mean, I love your show. I'm very honored and thrilled to be here, Guy. I just don't think that this is the right episode. RAZ: Should we, like, find a different one for you to be in? So this is Leana Wen, and she definitely belongs in this episode. Leana's an emergency physician by training and a pretty polarizing figure in medicine, which we'll explain why in a moment. So you don't think you're courageous? WEN: I think I'm determined. I think that I am not afraid to speak up when it's about defending my patients and defending my community and defending people who I really care about. RAZ: And what makes her so unpopular in the medical establishment is that Leana thinks you have a right to know more about your doctor - where their money comes from. And the story of how she came to that view began with her mother. Here's Leana Wen on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)WEN: When I was 8, my parents and I moved to the U. S. And ours became the typical immigrant narrative. My parents cleaned hotel rooms and washed dishes and pumped gas so that I could pursue my dream. Well, eventually, I learned enough English. And my parents were so happy the day that I got into medical school and took my oath of healing and service. But then one day, everything changed. My mother called me to tell me that she wasn't feeling well; that she had this cough that wouldn't go away; that she was short of breath and tired. Well, I knew that my mother was someone who never complained about anything. For her to tell me that something was the matter, I knew something had to be really wrong. And it was. We found out that she had stage four breast cancer - cancer that by then had spread to her lungs, her bones and her brain. My mother was brave, though, and she had hope. She went through surgery and radiation and was on her third round of chemotherapy when she lost her address book. She tried to look up her oncologist's phone number on the Internet, and she found it. But she found something else, too. On several websites he was listed as a highly-paid speaker to a drug company. And in fact, often spoke on behalf of the same chemo regimen that he had prescribed her. She called me in a panic, and I didn't know what to believe. Maybe this was the right chemo regimen for her, but maybe it wasn't. RAZ: So what'd you do? I mean, did you feel like he was compromised? WEN: It's hard to know. We never asked him about it - probably because there was just too much fear. I mean, how do you ask your doctor whether he or she is getting influenced by the money that he or she is getting - right? That's a very difficult question to ask. So we never found out. Well, I'll tell you that that seed of fear blossomed. And my mother no longer trusted his recommendations, even when he prescribed antibiotics for pneumonia. She would wonder - is it because it's the right medication for me or is he getting paid by the drug company? And that made me look into the literature, too. And at the time, in 2008, a New England Journal of Medicine paper found that 94 percent of doctors have some affiliation with drug companies or medical device companies. RAZ: Wow. WEN: And there were dozens of studies to show that those affiliations do in fact influence prescription behavior. And that really shocked me and made me want to do something about it. RAZ: And at that point, the thing that she wanted to do was to find out whether this kind of stuff bothered other people, too. So she gathered a team of researchers. And they started to survey patients about their health care. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)WEN: One after another, our respondents told us that that doctor-patient relationship is a deeply intimate one; that to show their doctors their bodies and tell them their deepest secrets, they want to first understand their doctor's values. People want to know about their doctors first so that they can make an informed choice. As a result of this, I formed a campaign - Who's My Doctor? - that calls for total transparency in medicine. Participating doctors voluntarily disclose on a public website not just information about where we went to medical school and what specialty we're in, but also our conflicts of interests. We go beyond the Government Sunshine Act about drug company affiliations, and we talk about how we're paid. Then we go one step further. We add our values when it comes to women's health, LGBT health, alternative medicine, preventive health and end-of-life decisions. We pledge to our patients that we are here to serve you, so you have a right to know who we are. We believe that transparency can be the cure for fear. Well, I thought some doctors would sign-on and others wouldn't. But I had no idea of the huge backlash that would ensue. RAZ: I mean, the feedback - the response was pretty overwhelming. Like, you were public enemy number one, like, (snapping fingers) overnight. WEN: I didn't expect for so many people even to read about it. I wrote about it for an online blog for doctors - just describing what we're doing, encouraging people to write me if they're interested. And I got so many negative responses. We're talking thousands of negative responses of people saying, how dare you attack me personally? Don't you understand how difficult life is? And I should not be a doctor. I'm betraying my profession. I should in fact have my medical license be taken away from me. They even went as far as calling my boss and asking for me to be fired. RAZ: Why do you think doctors reacted the way they did? WEN: This in particular is the hardest thing for them because it touches the very core of who we are as doctors. We pride ourselves in not letting anything influence our behavior. And yet, we've seen the studies. Everyone has seen the studies that, actually, these financial incentives do impact you. So people know this. And when I bring it out into the open, people feel threatened because it's the core of their identity and also often their incomes. And the more people started talking about it, the more angry many doctors became. I remember people started posting on these doctors' forums. And many of these doctors' forums, you have to register in your own name with your National Provider ID. And there was one particular instant that was particularly shocking. My Twitter account had gone down. And then I looked on this doctors' forum and someone took credit there for, quote, unquote, \"Twitter-bombing\" my account. And then various people wrote in and said too bad it wasn't a real bomb. Does anyone know where she lives? Does anyone know where she works? RAZ: Were you scared? WEN: I was. I remember calling my husband and talking to my friends and saying, maybe I should just quit this. I mean, this is not worth my life. And I didn't want my husband or my loved ones to be injured. But then I started hearing from patient advocacy groups - but also just regular people - who were overwhelmingly in favor of this. They said this is common sense, of course we want to know about any conflicts that our doctors may have. We want them to disclose this to us. There's also this sense from patients that it's not OK that our doctors get to decide what information we should know about. The information should be out there, and we should decide whether it's important for us. RAZ: I mean, you call yourself determined. Some people would say courageous. What's the source of it? Where does it come from? WEN: It's probably my mother, who was the reason why I got through a difficult childhood and upbringing, and every time I think back to what it was like when she was ill and what she went through and that initial moment when she found out about her oncologist. And this is what I want to prevent in the future. I don't want other patients to go through this realization and doubt and fear. And that I think is the source of my inspiration. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)WEN: My mother fought her cancer for eight years. She was a planner. And she thought a lot about how she wanted to live and how she wanted to die. Not only did she sign advance directives, she wrote a 12-page document about how she had suffered enough, how it was time for her to go. One day when I was a resident physician, I got a call to say that she was in the Intensive Care Unit. By the time I got there, she was about to be intubated and put on a breathing machine. But this is not what she wants, I said. And we have documents. The ICU doctor looked at me in the eye, pointed at my then 16-year-old sister and said, do you remember when you were that age? How would you have liked to grow up without your mother? Her oncologist was there, too, and said, this is your mother. Can you really face yourself for the rest of your life if you don't do everything for her? I knew my mother so well. I understood what her directives meant so well. And I was a physician. That was the single hardest decision I ever made - to let her die in peace. And I carry those words of those doctors with me every single day. RAZ: Did you have doubts at the time? WEN: I still have doubts now. And I wonder - I think I will always wonder - what would have happened if we did try something else? Would it have made my mother live a couple days longer, a couple weeks longer? Could she have lived a couple months longer even? But I still go back to what she says, which is that she had suffered enough. RAZ: I mean, it seems like she lived a life of courage. WEN: You know, my mother suffered a lot but never talked about her suffering. She was an academic. She had a significant role in student activism in China. She came to the U. S. by herself so that she could provide for a better life for us and to get my family away from persecution in China. Eventually we ended up staying on political asylum. And she lived her entire life fighting and struggling against whatever forces may be. She ended up being a teacher. She worked in some of the toughest school districts in Los Angeles - not because she had to but it was something she believed she really needed to. And that's, to me, is courage - of saying I know what needs to be done. I'm going to serve my community. And I'm going to fight against any forces that come my way because these are the right things to do. RAZ: Leana Wen. She is an emergency physician and founder of whosmydoctor. com. And she's now the new health commissioner in Baltimore. You can see her full talk at ted. npr. org.

I'm Guy Raz, and on the show today, stories of courage and justice - ideas about why people sometimes risk everything to do the right thing. (SOUNDBITE OF EXPLOSION)RAZ: Back in 2000, reporter Janine Di Giovanni rode a helicopter right into the middle of Sierra Leone's civil war. JANINE DI GIOVANNI: I begged, bribed, paid lots of money to get on a helicopter from Conakry, Guinea going into Freetown, which was empty. RAZ: Rebels were walking around the city killing people at random, and Janine was determined to get in. DI GIOVANNI: But yet, when we landed, crowds of people were desperate to get out, and the captain said, don't you think there's something wrong with you? You're desperate to be flown into a place where everyone is desperate to get out of. RAZ: Did you feel courageous? DI GIOVANNI: I don't think of myself as a courageous person. I think of myself as a pretty unique person. I just think my mind works in a different way than most people's do. And I think whereas, when most people would see danger, they'd probably run the other way, whereas my reaction would be, what's going on? I should move closer. I need to know. RAZ: And it doesn't matter where it is. That need to know is like the fuel that gives Janine the courage to go there - to be there. She's been shot at and detained, threatened, watched, followed, everywhere from. . . DI GIOVANNI: Rwanda, Kosovo, Somalia, Zimbabwe, East Timor, Liberia, Egypt, Syria, Libya. RAZ: Iraq, Afghanistan? DI GIOVANNI: Iraq, Afghanistan, of course, Pakistan. RAZ: Janine's probably covered every major war or conflict for the past 25 years - so obviously, an incredibly courageous person, right? But the thing is, she'd say that all of that pales in comparison to the kind of courage she's seen in others. DI GIOVANNI: And it usually comes down to ordinary people, when confronted with great evil, taking and making choices that would, for me, give the real explanation of courage. I mean, to me, I always thought the most courageous people I knew were people that faced insurmountable challenges in their lives. And that could be someone with cancer who battles it out and gets through the day, or children who walk to school in Africa because they really want to be educated, or someone who survives a genocide by hiding or hiding other people. RAZ: It's the kind of courage she saw in the people who lived through the siege of Sarajevo during the Bosnian war in the early 1990s. Janine talked about it on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)DI GIOVANNI: I had the honor of being one of those reporters that lived through that siege. And I say I have the honor and the privilege of being there because it's taught me everything, not just about being a reporter, but about being a human being. Even in the midst of terrible destruction and death and chaos, I learned how ordinary people could help their neighbors - share food, raise their children, drag someone who's being sniped at from the middle of the road, even though you yourself are endangering your life - helping people get into taxis who were injured, to try to take them to hospitals. I'm going to steal a story from a friend of mine, a Bosnian friend, about what happened to her. She was walking to work one day in April 1992 in a miniskirt and high heels. She worked in a bank. She was a young mother. She was someone who liked to party - great person. And, suddenly, she sees a tank ambling down the main road of Sarajevo, knocking everything out of its path. She thinks she's dreaming, but she's not. And she runs, as any of us would have done, and takes cover, and she hides behind a trash bin in her high heels and her miniskirt. And as she's hiding there, she's feeling ridiculous, but she's seeing this tank go by with soldiers and people all over the place and chaos and she thinks - I feel like Alice in Wonderland, going down the rabbit hole - down, down, down into chaos. And my life will never be the same again. A few weeks later, my friend was in a crowd of people, pushing, with her infant son in her arms, to give him to a stranger on the bus, which was one of the last buses leaving Sarajevo to take children out so they could be safe. And she remembers struggling with her mother to the front - to crowds and crowds of people - take my child, take my child - and passing her son to someone through a window. And the fact that she sent him off, which was a great act of courage, enabled him to survive. If she had kept him with her, who knows what could have happened? He could have been maimed, he could have been killed. And, instead, she gave him the chance to live. I mean, one of the things - many years ago someone said to me - what is the most remarkable thing to you about war? And I said that there is this incredible dichotomy - that on one hand, there's the evil that you literally can feel. But at the same time, it brings out this kind of extraordinary power in some people - in ordinary people - who just take it upon themselves to do the right thing. RAZ: Do you think that courage is like an unconscious response to circumstances, especially circumstances in a war zone? Or do you think that it's a deliberate, conscious process? DI GIOVANNI: I don't think it's a conscious process. We are programmed to survive and to protect ourselves and to put on your own air mask first before you help other people. But I think that, when it comes down to it, most people, I'd like to believe, are good people and wouldn't walk away. You know, I remember, during the war in Sierra Leone, just meeting this woman - just a neighborhood woman who sheltered all the local kids. She wasn't doing it for money, and she wasn't doing it for any reason other than she could. There are so many people that just, every day, toil - and it really is toil, you know - without recognition, without funding, because they believe in what they're doing. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)DI GIOVANNI: I now cover Syria, and I started reporting it because I believe it needs to be done. I believe a story there has to be told. I see, again, a template of the war in Bosnia. And when I first arrived in Damascus, I saw this strange moment where people didn't seem to believe that war was going to descend, and it was exactly the same in Bosnia and nearly every other country where war comes. People don't want to believe it's coming, so they don't leave. They don't before they can. They don't get their money out. They stay because you want to stay in your home. And then war and chaos descends. RAZ: When I used to cover wars, especially Iraq, I remember having this, like, pit in my stomach the night before I would go. You know, and that fear somehow seemed to cancel out any thoughts of feeling courageous. DI GIOVANNI: I mean, I think fear is natural, and I think that there is a reason why you should be afraid in places like Baghdad and Kabul. They are highly dangerous places. You're not meant to be there. When the war in Syria started, a lot of young journalists came who really didn't have much experience. And a lot of them had this recklessness which came from, I think, watching too many YouTube videos and films about war reporters and reading too many daring-do articles that were written in men's magazines about the glamour of being a war reporter. And it really scared me because I just - I've always thought, when I've run into these kind of people in the field, I go the other way because I don't think they get killed. I think they get other people killed. I think, to be a good reporter working in conflict, maintaining a level of fear is hugely important because that is your barometer. I think that courage is about knowing the limits and protecting yourself and other people around you. Fear is part of being courageous. It has to be. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)DI GIOVANNI: In 2004, I had a little baby boy, and I call him my miracle child because, after seeing so much death and destruction and chaos and darkness in my life, this ray of hope was born. And I called him Luca, which means the bringer of light, because he did bring - he does bring light to my life. But I'm talking about him because, when he was 4 months old, my foreign editor forced me to go back to Baghdad, where I had been reporting all throughout the Saddam regime and during the fall of Baghdad and afterwards. And I remember getting on the plane in tears, crying to be separated from my son. And, while I was there, a quite famous Iraqi politician who was a friend of mine said to me, what are you doing here? Why aren't you home with Luca? And I said, well, I have to see - it was 2004, which was the beginning of the incredibly bloody time in Iraq - I have to see - I have to see what is happening here. I have to report it. And he said, go home because if you miss his first tooth, if you miss his first step, you'll never forgive yourself. But there will always be another war. And there, sadly, will always be wars. And I am deluding myself if I think, as a journalist, as a reporter, as a writer, what I do can stop them. I can't. All I am is a witness. My role is to bring a voice to people who are voiceless. A colleague of mine described it as to shine a light in the darkest corners of the world, and that's what I try to do. Thank you very much.

I'm Guy Raz, and on the show today, stories of courage and justice - ideas about why people sometimes risk everything to do the right thing. (SOUNDBITE OF EXPLOSION) RAZ: Back in 2000, reporter Janine Di Giovanni rode a helicopter right into the middle of Sierra Leone's civil war. JANINE DI GIOVANNI: I begged, bribed, paid lots of money to get on a helicopter from Conakry, Guinea going into Freetown, which was empty. RAZ: Rebels were walking around the city killing people at random, and Janine was determined to get in. DI GIOVANNI: But yet, when we landed, crowds of people were desperate to get out, and the captain said, don't you think there's something wrong with you? You're desperate to be flown into a place where everyone is desperate to get out of. RAZ: Did you feel courageous? DI GIOVANNI: I don't think of myself as a courageous person. I think of myself as a pretty unique person. I just think my mind works in a different way than most people's do. And I think whereas, when most people would see danger, they'd probably run the other way, whereas my reaction would be, what's going on? I should move closer. I need to know. RAZ: And it doesn't matter where it is. That need to know is like the fuel that gives Janine the courage to go there - to be there. She's been shot at and detained, threatened, watched, followed, everywhere from. . . DI GIOVANNI: Rwanda, Kosovo, Somalia, Zimbabwe, East Timor, Liberia, Egypt, Syria, Libya. RAZ: Iraq, Afghanistan? DI GIOVANNI: Iraq, Afghanistan, of course, Pakistan. RAZ: Janine's probably covered every major war or conflict for the past 25 years - so obviously, an incredibly courageous person, right? But the thing is, she'd say that all of that pales in comparison to the kind of courage she's seen in others. DI GIOVANNI: And it usually comes down to ordinary people, when confronted with great evil, taking and making choices that would, for me, give the real explanation of courage. I mean, to me, I always thought the most courageous people I knew were people that faced insurmountable challenges in their lives. And that could be someone with cancer who battles it out and gets through the day, or children who walk to school in Africa because they really want to be educated, or someone who survives a genocide by hiding or hiding other people. RAZ: It's the kind of courage she saw in the people who lived through the siege of Sarajevo during the Bosnian war in the early 1990s. Janine talked about it on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) DI GIOVANNI: I had the honor of being one of those reporters that lived through that siege. And I say I have the honor and the privilege of being there because it's taught me everything, not just about being a reporter, but about being a human being. Even in the midst of terrible destruction and death and chaos, I learned how ordinary people could help their neighbors - share food, raise their children, drag someone who's being sniped at from the middle of the road, even though you yourself are endangering your life - helping people get into taxis who were injured, to try to take them to hospitals. I'm going to steal a story from a friend of mine, a Bosnian friend, about what happened to her. She was walking to work one day in April 1992 in a miniskirt and high heels. She worked in a bank. She was a young mother. She was someone who liked to party - great person. And, suddenly, she sees a tank ambling down the main road of Sarajevo, knocking everything out of its path. She thinks she's dreaming, but she's not. And she runs, as any of us would have done, and takes cover, and she hides behind a trash bin in her high heels and her miniskirt. And as she's hiding there, she's feeling ridiculous, but she's seeing this tank go by with soldiers and people all over the place and chaos and she thinks - I feel like Alice in Wonderland, going down the rabbit hole - down, down, down into chaos. And my life will never be the same again. A few weeks later, my friend was in a crowd of people, pushing, with her infant son in her arms, to give him to a stranger on the bus, which was one of the last buses leaving Sarajevo to take children out so they could be safe. And she remembers struggling with her mother to the front - to crowds and crowds of people - take my child, take my child - and passing her son to someone through a window. And the fact that she sent him off, which was a great act of courage, enabled him to survive. If she had kept him with her, who knows what could have happened? He could have been maimed, he could have been killed. And, instead, she gave him the chance to live. I mean, one of the things - many years ago someone said to me - what is the most remarkable thing to you about war? And I said that there is this incredible dichotomy - that on one hand, there's the evil that you literally can feel. But at the same time, it brings out this kind of extraordinary power in some people - in ordinary people - who just take it upon themselves to do the right thing. RAZ: Do you think that courage is like an unconscious response to circumstances, especially circumstances in a war zone? Or do you think that it's a deliberate, conscious process? DI GIOVANNI: I don't think it's a conscious process. We are programmed to survive and to protect ourselves and to put on your own air mask first before you help other people. But I think that, when it comes down to it, most people, I'd like to believe, are good people and wouldn't walk away. You know, I remember, during the war in Sierra Leone, just meeting this woman - just a neighborhood woman who sheltered all the local kids. She wasn't doing it for money, and she wasn't doing it for any reason other than she could. There are so many people that just, every day, toil - and it really is toil, you know - without recognition, without funding, because they believe in what they're doing. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) DI GIOVANNI: I now cover Syria, and I started reporting it because I believe it needs to be done. I believe a story there has to be told. I see, again, a template of the war in Bosnia. And when I first arrived in Damascus, I saw this strange moment where people didn't seem to believe that war was going to descend, and it was exactly the same in Bosnia and nearly every other country where war comes. People don't want to believe it's coming, so they don't leave. They don't before they can. They don't get their money out. They stay because you want to stay in your home. And then war and chaos descends. RAZ: When I used to cover wars, especially Iraq, I remember having this, like, pit in my stomach the night before I would go. You know, and that fear somehow seemed to cancel out any thoughts of feeling courageous. DI GIOVANNI: I mean, I think fear is natural, and I think that there is a reason why you should be afraid in places like Baghdad and Kabul. They are highly dangerous places. You're not meant to be there. When the war in Syria started, a lot of young journalists came who really didn't have much experience. And a lot of them had this recklessness which came from, I think, watching too many YouTube videos and films about war reporters and reading too many daring-do articles that were written in men's magazines about the glamour of being a war reporter. And it really scared me because I just - I've always thought, when I've run into these kind of people in the field, I go the other way because I don't think they get killed. I think they get other people killed. I think, to be a good reporter working in conflict, maintaining a level of fear is hugely important because that is your barometer. I think that courage is about knowing the limits and protecting yourself and other people around you. Fear is part of being courageous. It has to be. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) DI GIOVANNI: In 2004, I had a little baby boy, and I call him my miracle child because, after seeing so much death and destruction and chaos and darkness in my life, this ray of hope was born. And I called him Luca, which means the bringer of light, because he did bring - he does bring light to my life. But I'm talking about him because, when he was 4 months old, my foreign editor forced me to go back to Baghdad, where I had been reporting all throughout the Saddam regime and during the fall of Baghdad and afterwards. And I remember getting on the plane in tears, crying to be separated from my son. And, while I was there, a quite famous Iraqi politician who was a friend of mine said to me, what are you doing here? Why aren't you home with Luca? And I said, well, I have to see - it was 2004, which was the beginning of the incredibly bloody time in Iraq - I have to see - I have to see what is happening here. I have to report it. And he said, go home because if you miss his first tooth, if you miss his first step, you'll never forgive yourself. But there will always be another war. And there, sadly, will always be wars. And I am deluding myself if I think, as a journalist, as a reporter, as a writer, what I do can stop them. I can't. All I am is a witness. My role is to bring a voice to people who are voiceless. A colleague of mine described it as to shine a light in the darkest corners of the world, and that's what I try to do. Thank you very much.

Cinnamon, nutmeg and cocoa. Bayberry, holly and spruce. We asked a few random people around town what they think the holidays smell like. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Pine, mainly. Well, Christmas trees, I guess. Peppermint. Candy canes. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: Cinnamon, apples, that kind of thing. SIMON: Which often begins with. . . UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: My mother's cooking. Oh my, apple pie. Fried apple pies, apple cobbler, all of that. You know, even though I move from one area to another, it's still always the same. UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: The pine from the trees. My mother always had like - she always bought real trees. She didn't like fake trees. SIMON: What makes holiday smells into such powerful memories? We asked Mandy Aftel. She's author of the book \"Fragrant: The Secret Life Of Scent. \" She joined us from Berkeley, California and we asked her about frankincense and myrrh that's mentioned in the Bible. MANDY AFTEL: Frankincense and myrrh are, you know, kind of rock stars of the holiday season. They smell something called resin-y, which is kind of a warm, sort of balsamic smell. And really good frankincense has a sort of citrus note to it. It's kind of bright and cheerful with a kind of warm, gummy sort of resinous note to it. SIMON: Where would I smell it? AFTEL: Well, in the Catholic Church I think you could smell it a lot. SIMON: Oh, all right. So those of us who will be at holiday Mass will smell a lot of Frankincense? AFTEL: You will. Those swinging censers in the church have - they're little gums, like little pellets. The frankincense is actually the lifeblood of the frankincense tree. And they basically rub the tree with, like, a putty knife and the frankincense comes out in these very kind of beautiful crystalline resinous forms, you know, little chunks. SIMON: Well, what does smell do to our brains? Why do we connect with it so powerfully? AFTEL: Well, smell is amazing and really amazing at the holidays. Smells can take you back like music, but even more potent, to experiences that you've had. And they're connected to an old part of the brain called the limbic system in the brain and they're connected to emotion and memory. I think they get embedded in there, in your brain, without you being able to kind of get on top of it with words, so it's just a sensual experience. SIMON: What are some scents of the holidays that maybe we don't think about much as much as we would cinnamon, pine, gingerbread? AFTEL: So cinnamon, nutmeg, clove - all those spices are connected to holiday desserts. I also think the other one you mentioned, which I would just say a tiny bit more about, fir and pine. A lot of those are connected to cocktails and to people having a kind of a woody smell and taste in things that they're also kind of drinking - gin and holiday drinks. So I think we're drinking and eating and smelling things over the holidays maybe more than we do other times, which is why scent is so connected to holidays. SIMON: Candy cane has a real distinctive scent, doesn't it? AFTEL: Candy cane is peppermint. It's kind of like peppermint with vanilla and sugar. Really good peppermint has this very sweet smell and taste to it. And peppermint - it's very interesting, when I was doing my research on peppermint and spearmint, peppermint is mostly for desserts and drink whereas spearmint can be used in all sorts of ways, in sweet and savory. So peppermint we really think of as those festive, festive occasions. SIMON: We've obviously been talking about scents that are identified with Christmas, but the smell of latkes does it for a lot of people, too. AFTEL: Yes. Well, you know, some of the smell is a smell of home, like the real home fragrance. I know there's a huge home-fragrance industry, but the real home fragrance is the smell of things cooking in your home. SIMON: Yeah. We should explain, by the way, that latkes are essentially potato and onion pancakes and a signature of Hanukkah. AFTEL: Yes, and I think they smell divine in that kind of deep, comforting kind of way that potatoes do and that onions become kind of a very sweet smell when they're cooking. SIMON: Do you have a favorite scent this time of year? AFTEL: So I love the smells of fir, from the fir trees. I've always liked fir anyways, it smells kind of warm and jam-my and it reminds me of the Christmas tree. I love persimmon pudding, so I love the smell of like, nutmeg and cinnamon and things like that cooking, along with kind of cream and hard sauce. I like all that a lot. I find it just very beautiful and very rich and very human, in such a way that it just always makes me feel very happy. And of course, I love the smell of chocolate, always. SIMON: (Laughter). Mandy Aftel is the author of \"Fragrant: The Secret Life Of Scent. \" Thanks very much for being with us, and good sniffing to you in the season ahead. AFTEL: And you, too. SIMON: Before we go, another bystander said that when it comes to the aromas of the season. . . SUSAN STAMBERG: Well, I love the smell of mulled wine. So that's got to be a good, hearty red wine with cinnamon in it. You know, sticks of cinnamon, maybe some raisins, maybe some lemon, maybe some apple cider. But the other smell - I'm not so crazy about this - is the smell of an empty wallet after all the holiday shopping is done. SIMON: Doesn't that lady sound a lot like Susan Stamberg? (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"THE CHRISTMAS SONG\")NAT KING COLE: (Singing) Chestnuts roasting on an open fire. Jack Frost nipping at your nose. Yuletide carols being sung by a choir and folks dressed up. . . SIMON: Oh, Nat. You're listening to WEEKEND EDITION from NPR News.

UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #3: Look at Luna. RATH: Today, there are just under 3,000 southern sea otters in the wild - a quarter of what their population was 150 years ago. But researchers are now saying that conservation isn't just for the sea otters. James Delahoussaye reports that in Central California, sea otters are affecting all of us. JAMES DELAHOUSSAYE, BYLINE: On the roof of the Monterey Bay Aquarium, in a large plastic tank, sea otter mother Abby floats with her adopted pup, known as 671. Today, 671 needs to be weighed, which means separating her from her mother. Abby is not happy. (SOUNDBITE OF OTTER SQUEALING)DELAHOUSSAYE: For up to nine months, Abby will raise her little adoptee. And when 671 is ready, she'll be released into a protected inland salt marsh called Elkhorn Slough. And that's where Tim Tinker does his work, tracking otters for the U. S. Geological Survey. TIM TINKER: The reason we focus on sea otters is not just because they're cute and fun to watch, but because they have a very sort of outsized role to play in the functioning of the system. DELAHOUSSAYE: Take Elkhorn Slough. It's a protected habitat now, but 20 years ago, there were no sea otters here, and the marsh was a mess. Farmland runoff regularly pours into this estuary, loading it with man-made nutrients. TINKER: It's sort of just like throwing - you know, you throw a bunch of fertilizer here, you're going to get a whole bunch of algae growing. And that algae grows over top of the eelgrass and chokes it out. DELAHOUSSAYE: This eelgrass was the home to an entire food chain of animals, or it was, until all the algae. Bugs would normally keep the algae in check, but with no sea otters around, their favorite food, the crabs, ate all the bugs. And there lots and lots of crabs. TINKER: Within the marsh banks itself, there's all these holes - right? - and those are the crab condos. That's where they live. DELAHOUSSAYE: (Laughter) They're called crab condos? TINKER: That's what - that's what I call them. DELAHOUSSAYE: Brent Hughes is a researcher at the University of California Santa Cruz. He says there were so many crab condos, the muddy banks couldn't support themselves. BRENT HUGHES: This ecosystem's literally collapsing into the ocean. And so the reason being is because we're losing the banks and we're losing the marsh plants that are stabilizing it. DELAHOUSSAYE: And all this upheaval affects another animal - humans. Habitats like Elkhorn serve all sorts of ecological benefits. Fishermen benefit from natural fish nurseries. Homes benefit from a natural barrier to storms and sea rise. And the planet benefits from the carbon dioxide that marshland plants soak up. That's where the sea otters come in. Under decades of government protection, they're back and eating the crabs. That means the algae is down, the sea grasses up, and with crab condo vacancies, the muddy marshland banks are still here. Ecologist Tim Tinker says even he was surprised by the turnaround. TINKER: And all of the sudden, they teach us this entire new thing about how there's a food web that sea otters are a part of that can actually make sea grass healthy, even when there's nutrients. This was something we had no clue about. DELAHOUSSAYE: As Tinker drives back to the aquarium, he says that the philosophy behind sea otter conservation is changing. TINKER: We really need them. They're saving us. They're saving ecosystems that we rely on. So it's a different sort of message than the one that we started out with 15 years ago. DELAHOUSSAYE: It's not about saving individual species, as cute as they are. It's about saving entire ecosystems, and for that, he says, we need the sea otter. For NPR News, I'm James Delahoussaye.

Normally, snow and ice cool the surface by reflecting a lot of the sun's energy back up into the atmosphere. But warming melts snow and ice.

Because the ice melts from the top down, the surface elevation gets lower over time. And at lower elevations, the air generally is warmer. CSATHO: As Greenland is losing ice, it gets more and more irreversible because you get the ice into lower and lower elevations.

Let's get a psychologist on the case. DANIEL GOLEMAN: OK. I'm ready. RAZ: This is Daniel Goleman. GOLEMAN: I'm best known to most people as the author of \"Emotional Intelligence. \"RAZ: He pretty much coined that phrase. It's essentially the ability to evaluate another person's emotions. And Daniel's spent his entire career thinking about empathy. And you could say it's had quite the effect on him. GOLEMAN: You know, I don't pass people up on the street who are panhandling. I stop and give them something. RAZ: Every time? GOLEMAN: Pretty much every time, yeah. And you know, sometimes you can be skeptical and say, well, you know, this guy's just scamming, he's just trying to get some money for a drink. On the other hand, it's not really about what that person is going to do so much as what it evokes in us and whether we pay attention, we tune in, we empathize, we see a need and we help it. RAZ: OK, he might seem like an exception. I mean, most people would probably just walk right by a homeless person without even looking at them. And that's what Daniel's interested in, why we aren't more compassionate. Here he is on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)GOLEMAN: There was a very important study done a while ago at Princeton Theological Seminary that speaks to why it is that when all of us have so many opportunities to help, we do sometimes and we don't other times. A group of divinity students at the Princeton Theological Seminary were told that they were going to give a practice sermon and they were each given a sermon topic. Half of those students were given as a topic the parable of the Good Samaritan, the man who stopped to help the stranger in need by the side of the road. Half were given random Bible topics. Then one by one, they were told they had to go to another building and give their sermon. As they went from the first building to the second, each of them passed a man who was bent over and moaning, clearly in need. The question is did they stop to help? The more interesting question is, did it matter they were contemplating the parable of the good Samaritan? Answer - no, not at all. What turned out to determine whether someone would stop and help a stranger in need was how much of a hurry they thought they were in. Were they feeling they were late? RAZ: You would think that they would be the most compassionate, that they would all have stopped. GOLEMAN: And I think divinity students would think that they would stop, too (laughter). RAZ: Yeah, they're divinity students (laughter). GOLEMAN: But, you know, there's two major systems in the mind. One is the system that's an awareness where we have a view of ourselves that is our ideal self, and then there's another system that runs as much of the time, or too much of the time, where we're on automatic. And factors like time pressure rule us when we're on automatic. You have to be mindful. Being mindful means paying attention to what's going on in your own stream of thought, in your own stream of feelings and around you. Mindfulness is a general way of preparing yourself to be compassionate when the opportunity arises. RAZ: Like, what is our brain telling us to do or to be when we're behaving in a compassionate or in an empathetic way? GOLEMAN: Well, one of the first things that the science tells us is that there are different kinds of empathy and they don't all lead to compassion. One of them is cognitive empathy. That's understanding how the other person thinks about things, taking their perspective. This helps you communicate very well with people. It doesn't make you more compassionate necessarily. You can say Bernie Madoff was probably very good at cognitive empathy, he knew how to hustle people. The second kind is emotional empathy, where you feel immediately what the other person feels. And this can help you be very close, to have chemistry with a person, it's a basis of rapport. It's necessary, but it's not sufficient. The third kind of empathy is called empathic concern. It means I know how you feel, I know what you need, but I'm predisposed to help you if I can. It's the caring system of the brain. That's the core of empathy. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)GOLEMAN: There's a new field in brain science, social neuroscience, that studies the circuitry in two people's brains that activates while they interact. And the new thinking about compassion from social neuroscience is that our default wiring is to help. That is to say, if we attend to the other person, we automatically empathize, we automatically feel with them. They're these newly identified neurons, mirror neurons, that act like a neural Wi-Fi activating in our brain exactly the areas activated in theirs. We feel with automatically. And if that person is in need, if that person is suffering, we're automatically prepared to help. At least that's the argument. But then the question is why don't we? And I think this speaks to a spectrum that goes from complete self-absorption to noticing, to empathy and to compassion. And the simple fact is, if we are focused on ourselves, if we're preoccupied as we so often are throughout the day, we don't really fully notice the other. RAZ: OK. So people are so much less compassionate when they don't speak to you face-to-face, right? When they communicate digitally, like the kinds of things people write to Sally Kohn. There's a whole generation of people growing up right now who have always communicated like that, which must worry you, right? GOLEMAN: Absolutely. And my worry is this - the way in which humans have transferred skills in emotional intelligence and managing ourselves and in our relationships is through face-to-face interaction. Which means that the skill set is not being learned the way has been in past generations. And to the extent that we're communicating, say, by texting rather than face-to-face, we are communicating where there's no channel for the social brain. You're being deprived. You're being starved of vital information. RAZ: I mean, the consequences of that are potentially huge. GOLEMAN: It's an unprecedented experiment with an entire generation. RAZ: Yeah. I mean, you could imagine that it would be very hard to create a more compassionate world if people just, like, stopped communicating in the way that we've been communicating since we evolved into this form of species. GOLEMAN: One of the more interesting experiments going on is with what are called kindness curricula. And they just help kids understand the importance of wishing the people in your life to be well, that they should be happy, healthy and so on. And it turns out that that activates the caring centers of the brain and you become more likely to be the person who does pay attention, attune, empathize and care. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)GOLEMAN: Some time ago when I was working for The New York Times, it was in the '80s, I did an article on what was then a new problem in New York. It was homeless people on the streets. And I spent a couple of weeks going around with a social work agency that ministered to the homeless. What it did was to shake me out of the urban trance where, when we see - when we're passing someone who's homeless in the periphery of our vision, it stays on the periphery. We don't notice and therefore we don't act. One day soon after that - it was a Friday at the end of the day - I was going down to the subway. It was rush-hour and thousands of people were streaming down the stairs. And all the sudden, as I was going down the stairs, I noticed that there was a man slumped to the side, shirtless, not moving, and people were just stepping over him, hundreds and hundreds of people. And because my urban trance had been somehow weakened, I found myself stopping to find out what was wrong. The moment I stopped, half-a-dozen other people immediately ringed the same guy. And we found out that he was Hispanic, he didn't speak any English, he had no money, he'd been wandering the streets for days starving and he'd fainted from hunger. Immediately someone went to get orange juice, someone brought a hot dog, someone brought a Subway cup. This guy was back on his feet immediately. But all it took was that simple act of noticing. And so I'm optimistic. Thank you very much. (APPLAUSE)RAZ: Psychologist Daniel Goleman. He's writing a book right now, it's all about compassion. Watch his full talk at ted. npr. org.

I mean, this is not controversial stuff. We all want more common passion around us. So why is something so obviously simple so hard? Science writer Robert Wright says blame the reptilian part of your brain. ROBERT WRIGHT: You see this all the time. I mean, like, road rage, you know? That's - road rage, the more you think about it the stupider it is, but the rage itself, the tendency to become enraged when someone disrespects you, is a natural one that made sense in a hunter-gatherer environment. RAZ: I mean, somebody literally this morning was honking at me as I was driving my children to school, just really rudely honking at me. WRIGHT: And you know what they think was unjustified? Whatever it was you did right before they honked. Then you're both sure of it. RAZ: Just driving slowly, that's what I was doing. WRIGHT: Oh, people like you drive me crazy. RAZ: So that feeling - that is unfortunately a normal part of being a human, but it turns out, so is compassion. And there are reasons why our species evolved to be that way. It's an idea Robert explained on the Ted stage. The title of his talk is \"The Evolution Of Compassion. \"(SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)WRIGHT: So it's not going to sound as warm and fuzzy, maybe, as your average compassion talk. I want to warn you about that. So in the beginning there was compassion and, I mean, not just when human beings first showed up, but actually even before that. I think it's probably the case that in the human evolutionary lineage, even before there were Homo sapiens, feelings like compassion and love and sympathy had earned their way kind of into the gene pool. And biologists have a pretty clear idea of how this first happened. It happened through a principle known as kin selection. And the basic idea of kin selection is that if an animal feels compassion for a close relative and this compassion leads the animal to help the relative, then, in the end, the compassion actually winds up helping the genes underlying the compassion itself. So from a biologist's points of view, compassion is actually a gene's way of helping itself, OK? So I warned you this was not going to be very warm and fuzzy, OK? RAZ: So that would suggest that compassion is not entirely altruistic, right? It's actually, like, selfish in nature. WRIGHT: Well, anything built into us by natural selection has to ultimately have a kind of self-serving logic, at least self-serving at the level of the gene. I don't think that needs to drain the inspirational power out of compassion or anything or make us think any less of it. I think we should be grateful that a seemingly dog-eat-dog process like natural selection left us with an emotion - compassion - that not only do we naturally deploy beyond our families, but through reflection can actually learn to deploy very widely. RAZ: But there's still these small moments where our compassion is being tested. And, I mean, we don't always rise to the occasion. WRIGHT: You know, there's an interesting dynamic that you may or may not have noticed, which is when you see a beggar and you're not going to give them money, you really don't want to make eye contact with them. RAZ: Yes, it happens all the time. WRIGHT: Right, and you might ask yourself why that is and I think the answer is that one thing compassion is designed to do is to get us to - not necessarily strictly speaking - help people, but be seen as helping them. Right, so it seems to be very important to us that our generosity be acknowledged. And it seems to be kind of painful to us when we ignore a plea for help and are seen to be doing that because, remember, in the environment of our evolution, you know, a kind of a hunter-gatherer society, everyone you saw would be someone you were going to be seeing again and again and again. And so to deprive someone help they were asking for was to kind of be asking to pay a price for that down the road if you need their help or wanted their assistance. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)WRIGHT: Now, there's more good news that came along later in evolution, a second kind of evolutionary logic. Biologists call that reciprocal altruism, OK, and there the basic idea is that compassion leads you to do good things for people who then will return the favor. Again, you know, I know this is not as inspiring a notion of compassion as you may have heard in the past, but from a biologist's point of view this reciprocal altruism kind of compassion, it is ultimately self-serving too. It's not that people think that when they feel the compassion. It's not consciously self-serving, but to a biologist that's the logic. It's - and so you wind up most easily extending compassion to friends and allies. I'm sure a lot of you, you know, if a close friend has something really terrible happen to them you feel really bad. And - but if you read in the newspaper that something really horrible happened to somebody you've never heard of, you know, you can probably live with that, OK? That's just human nature. So it's another good news bad news story. It's good that compassion was extended beyond the family by this kind of evolutionary logic. The bad news is this doesn't bring us universal compassion by itself, OK? So there's still work to be done. RAZ: But, I mean, how do we show compassion, you know, when it's hard, like, for somebody that you just hate or is really cruel to you, you know? I mean, it's not easy to be compassionate all the time. WRIGHT: No, it's hard because we're designed to think we're being good when we're not. We are designed to convince ourselves that our very selective deployment of compassion is thoroughly justified. The good news is that we have compassion. We believe that it should definitely be channeled toward deserving people, but then the bad news is we define deserving people in a self-serving way, at least by nature. We can overcome this on reflection, but we have a tendency to be kind of unconsciously selfish, tribalistic, whatever, in the way we go about deciding who we're going to give our compassion to. You know, it's in a certain sense kind of the challenge humanity's been moving toward, like, forever. Here we are on the brink of having a global civilization and yet we're not doing a very good job of it, even though as we've been moving toward this point, the knowledge that should help us do it has been accumulating. We understand the problem. RAZ: Then what's holding us back? WRIGHT: Well, ultimately it gets back to the fact that natural selection is a process that designs things for purposes of serving self-interest. And what is in fact self-serving has changed over time and yet we're stuck with these brains that were designed in an age where what was self-serving was different. RAZ: When you look at, like, the course of human history and just the forces, right, that are propelling us forward, are you optimistic? I mean, do you think that we're becoming better, more progressive, evolved, compassionate people? WRIGHT: Well, the good news is that the logic behind being nice to other people is growing stronger and stronger because technology has made our fates more and more intertwined and we are designed to be nicer to people if their fate is intertwined with ours. The bad news is we seem not always good at recognizing how intertwined our fates are, but I do think we have something to build on. In principle, all it should take is making it clearer to people, you know, what is in their own interest. RAZ: Science writer Robert Wright - his latest book is \"The Evolution Of God. \" He's given two Ted talks. You can see both of them at ted. com. GUY RAZ, HOST:  So compassion - good idea, we all like it, redemptive capacity, blah, blah, blah, right? I mean, this is not controversial stuff. We all want more common passion around us. So why is something so obviously simple so hard? Science writer Robert Wright says blame the reptilian part of your brain. ROBERT WRIGHT: You see this all the time. I mean, like, road rage, you know? That's - road rage, the more you think about it the stupider it is, but the rage itself, the tendency to become enraged when someone disrespects you, is a natural one that made sense in a hunter-gatherer environment. RAZ: I mean, somebody literally this morning was honking at me as I was driving my children to school, just really rudely honking at me. WRIGHT: And you know what they think was unjustified? Whatever it was you did right before they honked. Then you're both sure of it. RAZ: Just driving slowly, that's what I was doing. WRIGHT: Oh, people like you drive me crazy. RAZ: So that feeling - that is unfortunately a normal part of being a human, but it turns out, so is compassion. And there are reasons why our species evolved to be that way. It's an idea Robert explained on the Ted stage. The title of his talk is \"The Evolution Of Compassion. \" (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) WRIGHT: So it's not going to sound as warm and fuzzy, maybe, as your average compassion talk. I want to warn you about that. So in the beginning there was compassion and, I mean, not just when human beings first showed up, but actually even before that. I think it's probably the case that in the human evolutionary lineage, even before there were Homo sapiens, feelings like compassion and love and sympathy had earned their way kind of into the gene pool. And biologists have a pretty clear idea of how this first happened. It happened through a principle known as kin selection. And the basic idea of kin selection is that if an animal feels compassion for a close relative and this compassion leads the animal to help the relative, then, in the end, the compassion actually winds up helping the genes underlying the compassion itself. So from a biologist's points of view, compassion is actually a gene's way of helping itself, OK? So I warned you this was not going to be very warm and fuzzy, OK? RAZ: So that would suggest that compassion is not entirely altruistic, right? It's actually, like, selfish in nature. WRIGHT: Well, anything built into us by natural selection has to ultimately have a kind of self-serving logic, at least self-serving at the level of the gene. I don't think that needs to drain the inspirational power out of compassion or anything or make us think any less of it. I think we should be grateful that a seemingly dog-eat-dog process like natural selection left us with an emotion - compassion - that not only do we naturally deploy beyond our families, but through reflection can actually learn to deploy very widely. RAZ: But there's still these small moments where our compassion is being tested. And, I mean, we don't always rise to the occasion. WRIGHT: You know, there's an interesting dynamic that you may or may not have noticed, which is when you see a beggar and you're not going to give them money, you really don't want to make eye contact with them. RAZ: Yes, it happens all the time. WRIGHT: Right, and you might ask yourself why that is and I think the answer is that one thing compassion is designed to do is to get us to - not necessarily strictly speaking - help people, but be seen as helping them. Right, so it seems to be very important to us that our generosity be acknowledged. And it seems to be kind of painful to us when we ignore a plea for help and are seen to be doing that because, remember, in the environment of our evolution, you know, a kind of a hunter-gatherer society, everyone you saw would be someone you were going to be seeing again and again and again. And so to deprive someone help they were asking for was to kind of be asking to pay a price for that down the road if you need their help or wanted their assistance. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK) WRIGHT: Now, there's more good news that came along later in evolution, a second kind of evolutionary logic. Biologists call that reciprocal altruism, OK, and there the basic idea is that compassion leads you to do good things for people who then will return the favor. Again, you know, I know this is not as inspiring a notion of compassion as you may have heard in the past, but from a biologist's point of view this reciprocal altruism kind of compassion, it is ultimately self-serving too. It's not that people think that when they feel the compassion. It's not consciously self-serving, but to a biologist that's the logic. It's - and so you wind up most easily extending compassion to friends and allies. I'm sure a lot of you, you know, if a close friend has something really terrible happen to them you feel really bad. And - but if you read in the newspaper that something really horrible happened to somebody you've never heard of, you know, you can probably live with that, OK? That's just human nature. So it's another good news bad news story. It's good that compassion was extended beyond the family by this kind of evolutionary logic. The bad news is this doesn't bring us universal compassion by itself, OK? So there's still work to be done. RAZ: But, I mean, how do we show compassion, you know, when it's hard, like, for somebody that you just hate or is really cruel to you, you know? I mean, it's not easy to be compassionate all the time. WRIGHT: No, it's hard because we're designed to think we're being good when we're not. We are designed to convince ourselves that our very selective deployment of compassion is thoroughly justified. The good news is that we have compassion. We believe that it should definitely be channeled toward deserving people, but then the bad news is we define deserving people in a self-serving way, at least by nature. We can overcome this on reflection, but we have a tendency to be kind of unconsciously selfish, tribalistic, whatever, in the way we go about deciding who we're going to give our compassion to. You know, it's in a certain sense kind of the challenge humanity's been moving toward, like, forever. Here we are on the brink of having a global civilization and yet we're not doing a very good job of it, even though as we've been moving toward this point, the knowledge that should help us do it has been accumulating. We understand the problem. RAZ: Then what's holding us back? WRIGHT: Well, ultimately it gets back to the fact that natural selection is a process that designs things for purposes of serving self-interest. And what is in fact self-serving has changed over time and yet we're stuck with these brains that were designed in an age where what was self-serving was different. RAZ: When you look at, like, the course of human history and just the forces, right, that are propelling us forward, are you optimistic? I mean, do you think that we're becoming better, more progressive, evolved, compassionate people?

TIPPETT: So this has been your tradition all your life? UNIDENTIFIED MAN: No, I've been - I was brought up in a very Hasidic family.

It's called On Being. TIPPETT: Which is about the great questions at the center of human life - what it means to be human, how we want to live. RAZ: On Being is the kind of show that actually makes you a more thoughtful person. And for doing that, the White House awarded. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED AWARD PRESENTER: The National Humanities Medal to Krista Tippett for thoughtfully delving into the mysteries of human existence. On the air and in print, Ms. Tippett avoids easy answers, embracing complexity and inviting people to. . . RAZ: You can call what Krista does compassionate. She gives all kinds of people a forum to talk about their deepest beliefs without judgment. And yet that word, compassion, it actually makes her cringe as she explained in her TED Talk. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)TIPPETT: We're here to celebrate compassion. But compassion, from my vantage point, has a problem. As essential as it is across our traditions, as real as so many of us know it to be in particular lives, the word compassion is hollowed out in our culture. And it is suspect in my field of journalism. It's seen as a kind of squishy, kumbaya thing. Or it's seen as potentially depressing. Now, compassion, when it enters the news, too often comes in the form of feel-good feature pieces or sidebars about heroic people you could never be like or happy endings or examples of self-sacrifice that would seem to be too good to be true most of the time. Our cultural imagination about compassion has been deadened by idealistic images. RAZ: So when we come back in a moment, Krista Tippett on how to bring meaning and heft back to that word - back to compassion. I'm Guy Raz, and you're listening to the TED Radio Hour from NPR. It's the TED Radio Hour from NPR. I'm Guy Raz. And on the show today, just a little nicer - ideas about compassion. So right before the break, we were hearing the start of Krista Tippett's TED Talk. Krista's the host of the public radio show On Being. And her big idea is that we need to rethink the meaning of compassion. TIPPETT: What I would say is that compassion is a core virtue that has within it a lot of the other virtues, you know, that either contains them or contributes to them so that it's a really central lens on, you know, what it looks like to lead a worthy life with gracefulness and purposefulness and, I think, a sense of meaning. RAZ: Here's Krista again on the TED stage. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)TIPPETT: Compassion is a piece of vocabulary that could change us if we truly let it sink into the standards by which we hold ourselves and others. And so what I'd like to do this morning is perform a linguistic resurrection. And I hope you'll come with me on my basic premise that words matter, that they shape the way we understand ourselves, the way we interpret the world and the way we treat others. So what is it three-dimensionally? What are its kindred and component parts? What's in its universe of attendant virtues? To start simply, I want to say that compassion is kind. Now, kindness might sound like a very mild word, and it's prone to its own abundant cliche. But kindness is a kind of everyday byproduct of all the great virtues. And it is a most edifying form of instant gratification. Compassion is also curious. Compassion cultivates and practices curiosity. Compassion can be synonymous with empathy. It can be joined with the harder work of forgiveness and reconciliation. But it can also express itself in the simple act of presence. It's linked to practical virtues like generosity and hospitality and just being there - just showing up. RAZ: I mean, and also what you do - right? - just by listening to people - that's an act of compassion. TIPPETT: I mean, listening is a hugely powerful form of attention. It's presence. And if you are really listening, you are genuinely curious. And you are open to be surprised and changed by what comes back at you. So compassion is not necessarily about agreeing with somebody else. It's not even necessarily about liking them. It is about making a choice to honor their humanity. RAZ: So I know that the way I think about you - you personify compassion, right? And you are, you know, just this incredibly understanding and empathetic person all the time and that you just kind of live these things. So is that right? You know. . . TIPPETT: No, it's not right. RAZ: OK, it's not. All right. TIPPETT: I mean, I live these things sometimes. I probably spend more time thinking about them. I spend a lot of time in conversation with people who are embodying them. I do my best, you know? I do my best, but I'm not always able to rise to this. I think what I've gotten better at is forgiving myself for that and getting up the next day and, you know, maybe doing it a little bit better. RAZ: Do you find yourself, like, recalibrating your compassion compass, like, reminding yourself to think a certain way or to do certain things? TIPPETT: You know, I actually think that compassion - that we should treat compassion, learning compassion and becoming more compassionate like we treat learning to play the piano or learning to throw a ball, that it's actually something that we can decide we are going to practice. And so, you know, rather than saying I have to become this compassionate person so that I can act this way, actually I think that this is one of these things where the more we do it, it actually then starts to work on us from the inside. RAZ: It's something you teach. TIPPETT: Yeah. You teach it. And the more then it becomes instinctive. Just as we are hard-wired to learn a language, I do absolutely think we're born with this redemptive capacity to be compassionate. Then again we have to start to practice it around each other. We have to start to embody it in front of our children and in our common life. I do think that that will be infectious. (SOUNDBITE OF TED TALK)TIPPETT: Our culture is obsessed with perfection and with hiding problems. But what a liberating thing to realize - that our problems in fact are probably our richest sources for rising to this ultimate virtue of compassion - towards bringing compassion towards the suffering and joys of others. Einstein became a humanitarian not because of his exquisite knowledge of space and time and matter but because he was a Jew as Germany grew fascist. Compassion can't be reduced to sainthood any more than it can be reduced to pity. So I want to propose a final definition of compassion, and that would be for us to call compassion a spiritual technology. Now, our traditions contain vast wisdom about this, and we need them to mine it for us now. But compassion is also equally at home in the secular as in the religious. So I will paraphrase Einstein in closing and say that humanity - the future of humanity - needs this technology as much as it needs all the others that have now connected us and set before us the terrifying and wondrous possibility of actually becoming one human race.

I'm Scott Simon. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"LONDON CALLING\")THE CLASH: (Singing) London calling. . . SIMON: The signature sound of The Clash. And Shannon Johnson, a researcher at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute, found that when she talked to youngsters about sea snails, she communicated a little more effectively if she skipped all the technical description and just called them punk-rock snails. SHANNON JOHNSON: Their entire shells are covered in spikes and then the spikes are actually all covered in fuzzy white bacteria. SIMON: The punk-rock snails live thousands of feet underwater, crowded around the mouths of chimneys of hydrothermal vents. Let's put it this way, it doesn't exactly sound like Santa Monica. JOHNSON: So they live in hot acidic poison, basically. So they're pretty hard-core. SIMON: Since Shannon Johnson had such success in calling the spiky acid-loving mollusks punk-rock snails, she and her colleagues decided to name them Alviniconcha strummeri after Joe Strummer, frontman of The Clash. JOHNSON: Not only was he a punk-rock icon - he's kind of one of the originators of the punk movement - but he also was kind of an environmentalist, he started a foundation that was planting trees all over the world. He's a neat guy. SIMON: Joe Strummer's not the only big name with his own namesake animal. There is a lemur named after John Cleese. There is a frog named after Ozzy Osbourne. You wonder, does the frog bite the heads off of bats? The Ramones each have their own trilobite and there's a parasitic wasp named after Shakira. The scientists who discovered the wasp say that it causes the caterpillar it inhabits to wiggle and writhe, which reminds them of Shakira's energetic dancing.

SIMON: It gets kind of lonely in those research labs, doesn't it? SCOTT SIMON, HOST:  This is WEEKEND EDITION from NPR News. I'm Scott Simon. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"LONDON CALLING\") THE CLASH: (Singing) London calling. . . SIMON: The signature sound of The Clash. And Shannon Johnson, a researcher at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute, found that when she talked to youngsters about sea snails, she communicated a little more effectively if she skipped all the technical description and just called them punk-rock snails. SHANNON JOHNSON: Their entire shells are covered in spikes and then the spikes are actually all covered in fuzzy white bacteria. SIMON: The punk-rock snails live thousands of feet underwater, crowded around the mouths of chimneys of hydrothermal vents. Let's put it this way, it doesn't exactly sound like Santa Monica. JOHNSON: So they live in hot acidic poison, basically. So they're pretty hard-core. SIMON: Since Shannon Johnson had such success in calling the spiky acid-loving mollusks punk-rock snails, she and her colleagues decided to name them Alviniconcha strummeri after Joe Strummer, frontman of The Clash. JOHNSON: Not only was he a punk-rock icon - he's kind of one of the originators of the punk movement - but he also was kind of an environmentalist, he started a foundation that was planting trees all over the world.

That's what happened to the steamer named City of Rio de Janeiro in 1901. That wreck killed 128 people, and the story of what happened to the ship after it struck the rock was lost when the ship went down. But now, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration - or NOAA - is using new technology to try to find shipwrecks like the City of Rio and learn about what happened to them. We're joined in our studios by James Delgado. He is NOAA's Maritime Heritage program director for the Office of National Marine Sanctuaries. Thanks much for being with us. JAMES DELGADO: Thank you. SIMON: So is this just an app you invented to find shipwrecks? What's the new technology? DELGADO: (Laughter) No, it's a convergence, if you will, of different technologies that have been developed and getting better. They're almost off the shelf now. But in this case, we used a new software that links to sonar called Coda Octopus Echoscope. And it's a three-dimensional scanning sonar that helps us not only find things, but map them and measure them underwater. SIMON: So this makes things more visible on the sea floor? DELGADO: It does. Where we work is often in water that is so deep, so dark - in the case of San Francisco Bay and the Golden Gate, you've got vast current with lots of sediment, so trying to find something with a visual system  is like trying to find something on the sidewalk in the midst of a driving rainstorm at midnight with a flashlight. So what do you do? You turn to sound. And in this case, high-resolution sound that paints a picture of the bottom of the sea and anything that sticks out. SIMON: Now do you have a list of famous wrecks that you kind of know where they went down and you look in those areas? DELGADO: We have a list of wrecks. But for me, the most exciting shipwrecks that we find are the ones that didn't show up on the list. SIMON: You have to tell us - like what? DELGADO: Well, like a schooner in the Great Lakes. Didn't know its name, just found it sitting on the bottom. And it became very clear in looking at that this was a regular work-a-day ship sailing from the United States over to Canada, carrying a cargo of coal. And in the midst of a winter storm, these guys fought hard. You could see the evidence - the pumps had been worked, they had raised only the (unintelligible). And iced in, they probably caught a wave and just gone straight to the bottom like a submarine. SIMON: Gosh. DELGADO: And these guys probably went to the bottom thinking their story would never be told. And yet there we were on that deck able to tell it. SIMON: I understand the impetus to find these wrecks and human stories. I wonder if there's also scientifically something we can learn about these bodies of water. DELGADO: Well, there's a tremendous amount we learn scientifically. I think in one way, when we get a shipwreck and we look at it in its context on the bottom, we're getting a time-stamped entry into a scientific record that tells us what happens with colonization, with marine organisms coming and turning it into habitat. SIMON: Forgive me for descending to this level, but I think a lot of people listening want to know, gold doubloons and pieces of eight? DELGADO: I have seen the occasional coin. SIMON: Yeah. DELGADO: But for the most part no. You don't see ships with treasure. I think that's a dream of many, but the reality is that the treasure's really the knowledge. SIMON: I understand you've been looking for a tugboat? DELGADO: We have seen the tug. We found it with our latest survey in September. It's a mystery wreck that's part of this Gulf of the Farrallones survey. We're still trying to sort out exactly what it is. There's no record of a tugboat having been lost out there. We've got pretty good historic records. So we're analyzing all the data and we may very well go back out and take another look at it. SIMON: But you can see artifacts in the. . . ? DELGADO: Well, you can see artifacts. There are plates and dishes. You can see the ship's machinery, the towing winches there - looks like the wire is slipped. Maybe they were towing and were damage and that's why it went down. But everything is in place. So it's another one of those cases where you look at it and you have this sense that something went wrong terribly, and maybe that's why we don't know exactly who it is.

Maybe you write a few checks or click and charge online. Or maybe you get asked to give directly at a shopping mall or at your front door. But the thing is, why do you give? And does the reason change depending on the situation? Here with some answers is Shankar Vedantam, NPR's social science correspondent. Welcome back. SHANKAR VEDANTAM, BYLINE: Hi, Audie. CORNISH: So this is the time of year, as they say, when people are perceived as being more charitable. But is it all altruistic? VEDANTAM: Well, when you ask people why they're generous, they will tell you that it is all about altruism, that they love a cause or they like to give. But scientists have increasingly sought to test these claims, Audie. I spoke with economist John List. He's at the University of Chicago. He's conducted a number of experiments into why people give. And he explained to me why he thinks this is important to do. JOHN LIST: Any time you ask someone, why did you give to this charitable cause, the typical response is, I gave because I really want to help another person. But when you actually dig down deeper, that's not the true motive for why they gave. And that's exactly why we need field experiments to try to disentangle reasons why people give. CORNISH: And I understand, Shankar, one of the reasons may be social pressure, right? And he does some experiments to try and make that case. VEDANTAM: That's right. So List thinks that social pressure might be playing a very powerful role. And he asked me to think about a scenario that's going to be familiar to lots of us. Here he is again. LIST: You're sitting on the couch watching a football game. And you hear somebody knocking on the door. And you think, OK, should I get up? Or should I stay watching the football game? Of course, a lot of people get up and answer the door. But once they see that there's a solicitor at the door, they say, oh, my God. I wish I would've stayed on the couch watching the football game. CORNISH: (Laughter). Right, so basically, you feel like you've been put on the spot. VEDANTAM: Exactly. And List realized that this scenario provides the perfect mechanism for an experiment that tries to find out how much social pressure plays a role in altruism. List sent volunteers into various Chicago neighborhoods to solicit money for a children's hospital. But there was a catch, Audie. Some households just got a cold call, a knock on the door. Others were alerted ahead of time that someone was going to be knocking on their door and asking for money. A third group was told that a knock was coming and given the choice to opt out. They could say they didn't want to be disturbed. Now, if people were giving only because of altruism, it shouldn't matter whether they know ahead of time that a knock is coming. But List finds that when households are alerted ahead of time, the number of people who answer that knock on the door, it falls by a quarter. When people are given the choice to opt out and say they don't want to be disturbed, donations fall by nearly half. And what List says this shows is how much social pressure shapes generosity. LIST: What you find is that roughly three-quarters of the dollars given are due to social pressure. And a quarter of the dollars given is actually due to altruism. VEDANTAM: Now, of course, Audie, we should mention that this was one experiment in one setting. There are lots of other reasons why people might want to give. People write checks in the privacy of their own homes where there's no social pressure. But in this kind of situation, and there are many like it - you know, you encounter somebody at the door of a store as you're leaving. Or maybe you're at church, and people are passing the collection plate. It's situations like that where social pressure probably plays an enormous role. CORNISH: So the idea that you're basically uncomfortable saying no to someone's face, right? VEDANTAM: Exactly. So in this experiment, you don't want the person at the door to think that you're a jerk for not wanting to help a children's hospital. The dilemma, Audie, is that for charities, putting people on the spot is effective. But it might be effective only in the short term because people don't like to be pressured. And they're going to find ways to dodge it. List, in fact, believes that charities need to focus on the 25 percent of people who are genuinely motivated by altruism because this is the group of people who are likely to be your long-term supporters. CORNISH: So what are some of the other strategies that charities and others have found to get us to open our wallets? VEDANTAM: You know, Audie, there are literally dozens of different things that people have tried. One of them is that when a charity sends you a gift - maybe they send you a calendar - the norm of reciprocity dictates that you send something back to them in exchange. Another idea is that if you can get people to donate their time to a cause, they're more likely to follow up with donations because people's wallets follow their feet. CORNISH: So I'm feeling a little guilty now for my introduction, right? The norms of the holiday season, right? This is the time of year to give. Does that also create a form of social pressure? VEDANTAM: You can think about social norms exactly as a larger example of social pressure at work. If you're at a workplace and everyone's writing checks to charities or doing things that are charitable, you feel kind of obliged to do the same. CORNISH: Shankar, thanks so much for explaining it.

That's why NASA is looking for cheaper ways to produce the next generation of space telescopes. And one place to save money is the telescope's mirror. As part of his series Joe's Big Idea, NPR's Joe Palca has this story of a scientist who's found a way to build mirrors using glitter. Here's Joe. JOE PALCA, BYLINE: Big telescopes use giant mirrors to capture starlight and focus it on a camera or some other kind of detector. The bigger the mirror, the finer the detail you can see out there. Astronomers like big mirrors. But in addition to the expense, Grover Swartzlander says there's another problem with building ever-larger telescopes. GROVER SWARTZLANDER: Well, there's a fundamental limit to the size of telescopes we can put in space. PALCA: Swartzlander's a physicist specializing in optics at Rochester Institute of Technology. He says they're just aren't rockets large enough to put really, really big telescopes into space. So instead of making mirrors the usual way out of glass, Swartzlander and his colleagues came up with the idea of making telescope mirrors that weigh practically nothing because they're made of what is essentially glitter, just like the stuff you buy in a crafts store. Tiny reflecting particles made of plastic with a metal coating. He says the idea is to take the shiny particles into space, spray a cloud of them outside the spacecraft and use lasers on the spacecraft to manipulate them into the shape of a mirror. SWARTZLANDER: By controlling all these little glittery objects in space and the sweeping laser beams across them, we are going to orient them and stabilize them enough so that we can form some kind of an image. PALCA: Now, there is a problem here. Yes, the mirror would be lightweight, but it wouldn't be a mirror with a smooth surface like you get with a glass mirror. SWARTZLANDER: The detector's going to see a bunch of speckles. It's going to be a very terrible image. But what the real progress is on this topic is that there's a new trend in imaging, which is called computational photography. And by taking a series of these images, we can unravel the actual - an image of - a good image of the object from all this speckley type of things that the detector will see. PALCA: Swartzlander says it'll take decades to perfect the technology for making giant glitter mirrors that can fly in space. But that doesn't mean this is just a pie-in-the-sky idea. SWARTZLANDER: We've already demonstrated this glitter concept in the laboratory. PALCA: Swartzlander says they went to their local Michaels - that's a craft store chain - bought a jar of glitter. . . SWARTZLANDER: And sprinkled it on to a concave surface. And one of my smart graduate students worked on some algorithms to actually achieve a perfect image. PALCA: And so this is just - down to the corner craft store and buy a jar of glitter and use that to create an image. SWARTZLANDER: That's correct. PALCA: Wow.

Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 was on a routine flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: (Unintelligible) To Beijing (unintelligible) for departure. CORNISH: Everything seemed normal for the first 40 minutes. And as it left Malaysian airspace. . . (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: Goodnight, Malaysian 370. CORNISH: Goodnight, Malaysian 370, the final words heard from the plane. Minutes later, it vanished from radar screens. And still, no trace of wreckage has been found. NPR's Geoff Brumfiel has this story of has happened since to a woman whose partner was aboard that flight. GEOFF BRUMFIEL, BYLINE: Sarah Bajc and Philip Wood were in the process of moving from Beijing to Kuala Lumpur. Wood has started a new job there. He was flying back to Beijing on Flight 370 to help finish packing. SARAH BAJC: The movers arrived at 9 o'clock on March 8. And of course, Philip wasn't there. And I had just learned the news that the flight had gone missing. BRUMFIEL: The movers turned around and left Bajc standing among the boxes. The plane's mysterious disappearance left her stranded between her old life and the new one she'd been planning with Wood. BAJC: So somewhere along the line in those first weeks, I made the decision I would still come here. BRUMFIEL: Today, she lives in Kuala Lumpur in the apartment she and Wood picked out together. She started a new job teaching at an international school. BAJC: I go to work. I go out socially on occasion. I've developed some nice friends. BRUMFIEL: But a big part of Bajc's life is still spent trying to understand what happened to her partner. She and other people whose loved ones disappeared on the plane are still searching for answers. BAJC: I spend a couple hours, you know, on the weekends, maybe an hour or so each evening, continuing to talk to experts in the industry. You know, we've hired a private investigator. I speak with them. I talk to the other family members. BRUMFIEL: She says she and the other families went through an emotional storm in the first month after the crash. Every twist and turn in the search was being reported on 24-hour cable news. It was like watching a real-time thriller. (SOUNDBITE OF NEWS BROADCAST)UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: Satellites capture more images of debris floating in the Indian Ocean. But the question remains, is it from the Malaysian Airlines Flight 370? BAJC: Every time there was a new sighting of debris, you know, you have this incredible new burst of adrenaline of what might be. And, you know, then, of course, another crashing as it's all disproven over and over and over again. So that was awful. BRUMFIEL: The ups and downs were made worse by confusing and sometimes contradictory statements from Malaysian investigators. Bajc says her breaking point came one night in late March. BAJC: And a text message came in on my phone. BRUMFIEL: It was from the airline. And it said they now knew everyone on board was dead. BAJC: Irrefutably, the plane has gone down on the southern Indian Ocean, and all lives were lost. BRUMFIEL: Bajc broke down that night. But in the days that followed, the plane's wreckage never turned up. Today, she no longer believes the investigators. BAJC: There has not been a single thing that they had said that has been proven to be true. There have been many, many, many things that they have said that have proven to be false and/or outright lies. BRUMFIEL: The head of Malaysia's investigation team did not respond to an NPR email request for an interview. But Australian investigator Martin Dolan says he stands by the official account. MARTIN DOLAN: There's a lot of people who are asserting that information is being concealed or distorted. We don't believe that's the case. BRUMFIEL: Dolan heads the Australian transportation safety bureau, which is aiding in the search for the missing plane. He says his agency has independently reviewed all data from radar and satellites. And this is what it shows. After Flight 370 vanished, the plane made a series of unexpected turns that led it south to the remote reaches of the Indian Ocean. It flew for hours, then ran out of fuel and crashed. But Dolan acknowledges the evidence is fragmentary, blips on a military radar, brief pings from an orbiting satellite. DOLAN: And so if you're looking for a solution to the mystery of what has happened to someone you very much love, that's not a satisfactory thing, and we understand that. And the only way we can give that satisfaction is by finding the aircraft. BRUMFIEL: Without the finality of the wreckage, Sarah Bajc says many families are in limbo. They don't want to complete paperwork that would normally follow the death of a loved one, and that's leading to a different sort of crisis. BAJC: The reality is there are some of the families that are in desperate need of the financial closure on things like insurance and they need something in order to be able to collect on policies. I mean, you've got women who were left with children and no career. And they need help, so something's going to have to break. But the issuance of a death certificate is an emotional thing because we're not convinced that they're dead. BRUMFIEL: When Philip Wood first disappeared, Bajc still felt his presence. BAJC: For a long time, I still felt him with me. I mean, really physically felt him with me. That lasted for months. It lasted even through moving here. I feel that less frequently now. BRUMFIEL: But Bajc says without wreckage, she can't give up on the possibility he's somehow alive. BAJC: There is still a chance. And until that's disproven, I will continue to search for him. BRUMFIEL: Meanwhile, in the southern Indian Ocean, two sonar-equipped search vessels are inching their way across the open sea. They're scanning the bottom for debris from Malaysia Airlines Flight 370. Geoff Brumfiel, NPR News.

These unique sounds were first recorded in the mid-1960s. Michael May introduces us to the man who first recorded this. (SOUNDBITE OF WHALE SONG)ROGER PAINE: This, I always thought, was the best recorded song. MICHAEL MAY, BYLINE: Biologist Roger Paine is at home in Vermont listening to the songs of his beloved humpback whales in his living room. (SOUNDBITE OF WHALE SONGS)PAINE: And that sort of theme evolves as the whale sings it. I would say that these sounds are - with no exception that I can think of - the most evocative, most beautiful sounds made by any animal on earth. MAY: When Roger Paine started studying whales in 1966, there was very little known about the sounds they made or why they made them. He went to Bermuda where whales passed on their migratory routes, and there he met sound engineer and military researcher, Frank Watlington. And it was Watlington who gave Paine this recording - he wasn't even sure what it was. (SOUNDBITE OF WHALE SONGS)PAINE: You're going to hear explosions of dynamite. That's what Frank was listening for and the whale is just getting in his way. MAY: Paine brought the recording back to his office in New York and he listened deeply. PAINE: I would just leave it on - just going again and again and again. And after a long while of listening to this, I suddenly realized - my God, this thing is repeating itself. MAY: This was a startling discovery. If an animal repeats a sound, like a bird or a cricket, then it's technically a song. This however, was arguably the most complex song of any animal. At the time, whales were headed for extinction. During the 1950s and '60s, more than 50,000 whales were killed each year. Roger Paine saw the songs as a call to arms. PAINE: Do you make cat food out of composer poets? I think that's a crime. MAY: For the next two years, Paine spent as much time distributing these recordings as studying them. He gave them to musicians, composers, singers. PAINE: What I wanted to do was try to build them into human culture -anything, any damn thing that anybody wanted to try - hey, that seemed fun to me. JUDY COLLINS: So it was 1969 in the summer - and I was playing the long-suffering Solveig in \"Peer Gynt\". MAY: That's singer Judy Collins. COLLINS: And this tall man came backstage and I didn't know him - he said, I'm Roger Paine, I study whales - I'm a cetologist. And he handed me this little package. MAY: Inside was a reel-to-reel tape. She took it home and put it on. (SOUNDBITE OF WHALE SONGS)COLLINS: I was very emotional. Angst for being a human being on a planet where they also live - guilt for doing what we do to them. (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"FAREWELL TO TARWATHIE\")COLLINS: (Singing) Farewell to Tarwathie. Adieu Mormond Hill. MAY: This is \"Farewell to Tarwathie\" from Collins' 1970 record, \"Whales and Nightingales\". It's an adaptation of a traditional whaling song. The record went gold and it introduced millions to the songs of the humpback whales. COLLINS: You hear the whales come in and then I join them, and it is like a call and response in a way because I am having a dialogue with them and vice versa because they're answering me as well. And in a sense,  reaching out into the human species. MAY: That same year, Capitol Records released Paine's recording of humpback whale songs. It's still the best selling natural sounds record of all time. A couple of years later, a dozen or so antiwar activists working for a fledgling organization called Greenpeace, gathered at a meeting in Vancouver. Former Greenpeace director Rex Weyler says, one of them played the whale songs. REX WEYLER: And that was the first time any of us had heard those recordings and it certainly was a huge factor in convincing us that the whales were an intelligent species here on planet Earth and actually made music, made art, created an esthetic. MAY: Greenpeace was looking for a campaign that would jumpstart a new environmental movement. And they found it - save the whales. They played the whale songs on the radio and TV to raise money for the campaign and they used the songs in their actions as well. When they took their first ship out into the Pacific in 1975, they confronted a Soviet whaling vessel. (SOUNDBITE OF SOVIET WHALING VESSEL)MAY: They blasted Paine's recordings of the humpback whales over a loudspeaker. (SOUNDBITE OF WHALE SONG)MAY: Rex Weyler was there. WEYLER: There were hundreds - hundreds of crew members and they were all out on deck. They were all listening - who knows what effect it had on them. MAY: That moment lasted a few seconds. Then, the whalers continued the slaughter. But now, the world was paying attention. WEYLER: Saving the whales became the issue that we believed would introduce humanity to the idea of ecology and saving nature. MAY: Save the whales was a success. Other organizations around the world joined the cause. And in 1982, The International Whaling Commission instituted a ban on deep-sea whaling. Only a half-dozen countries still hunt whales.

(SOUNDBITE OF MARS ONE APPLICATION VIDEO)HEIDI BEEMER: Everything I've done academically and professionally has been for one reason - to leave this Earth and represent humanity on Mars. RATH: That's a clip from Heidi Beemer's application video for Mars One, a nonprofit that's aiming to get people settled on Mars by 2025. She made the first round of cuts to be Mars One astronaut, and she's now about to interview for the next round. But Beemer is so determined to get to Mars, she has a plan B. She's also a finalist for a year-long Mars simulation planned for next year in the High Arctic. I spoke with her just after she'd finished a two-week test for that mission in the Mars Desert Research Station in Utah. BEEMER: My crew and I acted as if we were astronauts. We got to do full Martian simulation inside of a building called a hab, or the habitat. And every time you went outside, you had to wear a spacesuit. And you really got that feel every time you looked out the window - like, I feel like I'm on Mars. RATH: And having gone through that stimulation - has that affected your enthusiasm for Mars? BEEMER: Not at all. If anything, it's kind of reaffirmed it. I really learned a lot about myself while I was there. The group I was with - I was with six other people from around the world. And with different cultures and different backgrounds, it really forced us to work together in ways I never really thought would happen. And I kind of found myself taking steps back. Like, I tend to be the kind of person that is gung ho and gets involved as much as I can, but I felt more of a team player, which was a really cool opportunity for me - just learning about how I interact with other people and learning how to get along in such an isolated environment. So it was really cool not only doing scientific research, but also learning so much about myself. And it really made me more excited about just knowing that I could feel comfortable in those scenarios and one day, using those skills that I learned while living on Mars, again in isolation and close quarters. RATH: You told us the last time we spoke that even if you don't get the chance to go to Mars, you want to educate people about the red planet. Have you got a chance to do that this past year? BEEMER: I definitely have. That's one of the most exciting things, I think, about being a Mars One candidate - is the fact that I've kind of gained a little bit of micro-fame within my community. I've had the opportunity to travel to a couple different schools - elementary, middle, high schools. I've Skyped classes all across the country and, to this point, all across the world. Giving kids the opportunity to have aspirations just like I did when I was so young has been so rewarding for me. RATH: And you've been dreaming about this - about the possibility of going to Mars - since you were a little girl. Since the last time we spoke - just under a year - has it gotten a little bit more real - that dream? BEEMER: Oh, yeah, it really has. It's crazy that I'm really - I feel part of this. And I feel like as the project moves on and it gets closer to selecting its astronaut candidates, I just - I feel just so honored and accomplished. It's so crazy that I'm only 25-years-old, and I'm already part of such a big mission. RATH: Lieutenant Heidi Beemer is a Mars enthusiast, and she's also in the Army. She's a chemical defense officer with Fort Campbell's 63rd Chemical Company in Kentucky. Heidi, pleasure speaking with you again, and good luck. BEEMER: Oh, thank you so much.

A new story looked at how alcohol affects communication - bird communication. Christopher Olson and his colleagues at Oregon Health and Science University got a bunch of zebra finches drunk and singing in the name of science. I asked him what they were expecting to happen, and why give alcohol to birds in the first place? CHRISTOPHER OLSON: Well, we wanted to study how alcohol affects the production of bird song because we use the zebra finch is a model to study human vocal learning in the first place. And that's the process that allows humans to learn how to communicate with language. And that's a fairly unique trait that we have. So we, as humans - we learn to speak by hearing other people talk, and birds have a very similar process. And we all know that alcohol affects human speech, so. . . (LAUGHTER)RATH: Now, how did you get the birds drunk? OLSON: Well, we just showed up in the morning and mixed a little bit of juice with six percent alcohol and put in their water bottles and put in the cages. And, you know, at first, we were thinking that they wouldn't drink on their own because, you know, a lot of animals just will not touch the stuff. But they seem to tolerate it pretty well, and be somewhat willing to consume it. RATH: And how tipsy - how intoxicated did the birds get? How do you (laughter) - how do you measure that? OLSON: Well, we can take a small blood sample, and we have yet to invent the bird breathalyzer, but. . . (LAUGHTER)OLSON: . . . Which would be easy. But we can take a small blood sample, and what we see is blood ethanol concentrations in the range of 0. 05 to 0. 08 percent. And so, you know, 0. 08 is the legal limit to drive, just to give you a baseline. They're just underneath that. RATH: And so, well, let's get to the effects of alcohol on the birdsong. So the first we're going to hear - this is the normal zebra finch song. (SOUNDBITE OF ZEBRA FINCH SONG)RATH: And this is the drunk song. (SOUNDBITE OF ZEBRA FINCH SONG)RATH: Now, Chris, I know that birds can hear a lot more detail in sound than we do, which is good because I can't really tell a difference between these two. OLSON: Yeah. It's probably hard. You know, all of the syllables that you heard in the first song where there that, you know, if I had been drinking the amount those birds had, all of my speech would probably be there, too. So you can't really judge it on big structural differences in the song. But if you take smaller syllables out and slow them down, you start to hear the difference. RATH: So let's bring this down to a level that humans can perceive. So first we'll have the slowed down normal zebra finch song. (SOUNDBITE OF ZEBRA FINCH SONG)RATH: And then this is the slowed down drunken song. (SOUNDBITE OF ZEBRA FINCH SONG)RATH: It sounds a little bit sloppier. OLSON: A little sloppier. Well, the main effects that we see are that it's a little bit quieter. And then, also, the ones that had been consuming alcohol are a bit less organized in their sound production. A good analogy, perhaps, is, you know, in college, you probably had a roommate who called you up to pick him up from the bar. And you knew right away something was up because you could hear differences in their voice, you know. RATH: And what about the song learning process? These birds learning songs pretty much the same way that humans acquire speech - does it interfere with that? Does alcohol interfere with that? OLSON: Yeah, and actually that'll be an important next direction that we want to take this research. Obviously, there's a lot of interest in how alcohol affects developing brains and, for us, how alcohol affects speech production and vocalization. And the bird model actually presents us with a really unique opportunity to examine that. RATH: Christopher Olson is a neuroscientist at Oregon Health and Science University. He and his colleagues have just published a study on the drunken music of zebra finches. Christopher Olson, very interesting stuff. Thank you. OLSON: Sure. Thank you for having me on.

After a motorcycle accident in 1981, Cochrane lost the use of a part of his brain that had been considered essential for memory. He then shocked his doctors by being able to remember some things - facts, but not personal memories. That fundamentally changed our understanding of how the brain remembers. Shayna Rosenbaum is a principal investigator at the Cognitive Neuroscience Lab at Toronto's York University, and she worked directly with KC. SHAYNA ROSENBAUM: He would remember people that he knew from prior to the time of his injury, so he knew who his parents were. He knew what friends that he had in the past. He knew how he had formed those relationships. But what he was unable to remember were details relating to those individuals. For instance, he wouldn't remember the last time that he had laughed with one of those individuals. He couldn't remember his own high school graduation, even though he knew that he had graduated. RATH: Can you tell us how this understanding of how these brain structures work when it comes to memory - what it means for science or even helping people who might have suffered memory loss or brain damage? ROSENBAUM: Well, the structure of the brain, the hippocampus, which is responsible for forming new memories and for retaining old ones is vulnerable to a wide range of neurological conditions, including not only head injury, but also Alzheimer's disease, encephalitis, epilepsy. So many people, unfortunately, suffer from certain forms of memory loss. But what we've learned is that not all forms of memory are affected, so memory is not just one thing. And we've learned from cases like KC that patients can, in fact, rely on the types of memories that are spared, such as memory for facts about the world and about oneself in order to compensate for those aspects that are impaired. RATH: You worked with KC - with Ken Cochrane - directly. Did he understand the importance of what was being learned from his condition? ROSENBAUM: I believe that in the moment, he did. When we drew his attention to the many contributions that he had made to our understanding of memory, he himself was blown away. He would often show amazement when we would show him a newspaper article that was written about him. And when we explained how we now understand that memory is not one thing based on studies involving him, he really did seem to appreciate the types of contributions that this made to our understanding of memory.

Here's something President Obama argues we'll be living with for generations to come. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: There's one issue that will define the contours of this century more dramatically than any other. And that is the urgent and growing threat of a changing climate. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Even as Obama struggled with other big challenges this year, climate was one area where he managed to get some traction, as NPR's Scott Horsley reports. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: 2014 was a milestone year, as the threat of a changing climate became more obvious and immediate and as governments here and around the world began to respond. In June, the EPA unveiled new rules governing power plants - the number one source of greenhouse gases in the U. S. David Doniger, who's with the Natural Resources Defense Council, says those long-awaited rules are the centerpiece of President Obama's effort to fight climate change. DAVID DONIGER: 2014 is the year in which a lot of these initiatives took form and became public so this has been a big year. HORSLEY: The administration has also taken steps to boost energy efficiency and promote cleaner sources of electricity that don't produce carbon pollution. None of that sits well with the coal mining industry that Luke Popovich represents. He's vice president of the National Mining Association. LUKE POPOVICH: It's almost jihad against fossil energy, but particularly focusing on coal. This is the electricity generation that you depend on for your air conditioning in the summer and your heat in the winter. HORSLEY: Obama's plan does call for significant cuts in greenhouse gases; cuts the president calls ambitious but achievable. And he's not just focused on U. S. pollution. In November, Obama announced a landmark carbon-cutting deal with China - the world's leading producer of greenhouse gases. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)OBAMA: This is a major milestone in the U. S. -China relationship. And it shows what's possible when we work together on an urgent global challenge. HORSLEY: The U. S. -China deal provided a jumpstart for international climate talks expected to culminate in Paris this coming year. Critics complain that while the U. S. is already cutting its carbon pollution, China's emissions are allowed to keep growing through 2030. China is already making big investments in clean energy, though. And the Chinese government has announced plans to cap the use of coal within five years. Doniger, of the NRDC, says the choking smog problem gives China a big incentive to clean up its power plants. What's more, he says, the Chinese government is genuinely worried by increasingly dry weather in the northern part of the country and rising sea levels in the East. DONIGER: They understand climate change is real. And when their scientists tell them it's real, they don't have a bunch of ideologues who tell them it's a hoax. HORSLEY: Obama's climate agenda is about to face new political headwinds, though. His announcement in China came just eight days after the midterm elections, which gave Republicans control of not only the U. S. Senate, but also two-thirds of state legislative chambers. States are responsible for implementing the new EPA rules. The National Mining Association's Popovich says that could be the next climate battleground if some try to delay or thwart the administration's policy on power plants. POPOVICH: It's going to come down to governors in two, three dozen states saying you have to tear this up and start over again. We can't expose our citizens to these kind of cost increases for so little benefit. HORSLEY: EPA administrator Gina McCarthy is not backing down. She points to polls showing most Americans want the government to cut greenhouse gases, even if that means they have to pay a bit more for electricity. GINA MCCARTHY: I feel very confident in - that the American people want the EPA to continue to protect them and their family and, most importantly, their kids. They are worried about climate change and they want us to do something so I'll hopefully let democracy work. HORSLEY: One unexpected wrinkle in climate policy stems from the steep drop in oil prices. With gasoline now averaging less than $2. 40 a gallon nationwide, demand for SUVs and pickup trucks has picked up, potentially undermining some of the gains of the administration's tougher fuel economy standards. And there's one more way this year has marked a climate milestone. If the numbers from November and December follow the trend of the first 10 months, 2014 will go down as the hottest year on record.
